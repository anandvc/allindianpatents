PROVISIONAL<br>
The following specification describes the<br>
invention.<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
1-4-2008<br><br><br>
This invention relates to 'an improved spring loaded true mechanical face seal assembly for coal or cement mills'.<br>
The present invention is an improvement over Patent Application No. 753/MUM/1999 dated 3.11.1999 titled as "A new spring loaded sealing assembly mechanism offering face sealing in addition to rubber seal for coal or cement mills" wherein the assembly of spring loaded unit is called 'SLU.<br>
Earlier patent application No. 753/BOM/1999 mentioned above is related mainly to "Spring Loaded Units"; whereas the present patent application no. 1198/MUM/2004 refers additionally to mounting plate, a chamber and SPT (Special Purpose Tool); the sealing face of the stationary portion is made flat &amp; in one plane in situ offering true face sealing . The use of SPT is possible because of horizontal splitting of earlier air seal housing into 2 parts e.g. mounting plate (44) and chamber (40) in figures (3) &amp; (4).<br>
The said SLU consists of spring/s. spring loading(s), spring adjustment(s) and spring placement(s). Each said 'SLU' being mounted firmly on a fixed ring and each said 'SLU' being provided with a mechanism like a pencil or a solid rod or a pin; at the end of the said pencil, rod or pin, there is optionally provided a hard faced tip which is of a wear resisting material and said pencil or rod or pin extends from and through the 'SLU' and presses on the top of the seal runner pressing the seal runner firmly on the seal plate.<br>
Plurality of such 'SLU's are fixed on the fixing ring at an appropriate pitch circle diameter or diameters and distances, and due to plurality of such 'SLUs' and mounting positions the seal runner is kept uniformly pressed on the seal plate.<br>
Earlier in the matter of the mechanical face seal of coal mill it was assumed that the seal runner sits flat on surface of the seal plate. However,<br><br><br>
the problem of air leakage continued despite spring loading which presses seal runner on seal plate. This leakage was obviously due to the top surface<br>
of the seal plate not flat &amp; / or not in one plane. This was due to the<br>
inherent &amp; intrinsic quality &amp; type of the components of the assembly. To see the top surface of the seal plate in assembled condition in-situ, the air seal housing is now split horizontally in two parts &amp; shown dearly in figures No. 3 &amp; 4, as (a) mounting plate (44) &amp; (b) chamber (40).<br>
The mounting plate (44) with pre-fixed seal plate (9) is now introduced and fixed on the upper bearing housing cover (39). It is now also possible to "work on" the top surface of the seal plate. And as it is possible to work on, a SPT with which it is possible to make the top surface of the seal plate "flat" &amp; "in one plane" is introduced.<br>
Therefore, according to present invention, "an improved spring loaded true mechanical face seal assembly and a special purpose tool for coal and such mills" comprises of SLU's, mounting plate and a chamber and SPT, the said mounting plate with a pre-fixed seal plate being fixed onto the upper bearing housing cover, the top surface of the said seal plate worked on in-situ with a special purpose tool, the said special purpose tool consisting of a holder in form of a ring, the said ring holder divided at least in two halves, the inner diameter of the said ring holder being slightly more than the outer diameter of the dust guard; bearings are kept on plurality of places within the said ring holder; said ring holder being provided with suitable knurled handles for manual operation; two or more parts of the holding ring are assembled by means of locating pins and holding screws by known methods; the said tool being introduced above the said seal plate, and rotated or moved in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions manually or by other known methods so that the top surface of the Seal Plate is made flat due to the file like action of said special purpose tool.<br><br><br>
Said bearings are kept on plurality of places within the said ring holder such that the inner surface or edges of the said holding ring does not damage the outer surface of the said dust guard during use.<br>
The said holding ring having plurality of recesses in which files or any abrasive material are located and fixed in such a way that the filing or abrasive faces are in one plane and protruding out of the working surface of the said holding ring.<br>
When said special purpose tool is introduced over the seal plate, and fixed together, the said special purpose tool is made to rotate in clockwise and anti¬clockwise directions so that the top surface of the seal plate is flattened and the said special purpose tool has file like action thereby removing all uneven spots, high points and high portions of the said seal plate.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
The improvement will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein the drawings comprise of four figures. In the figures features are marked by numerals and are explained here below :<br>
Fig. 1   describes    the    invention  given  in     the       original       Application<br>
No.573/MUM/1999.<br>
Fig. 2 describes the special purpose tool and the ring holder and the placement of the bearings as well as location of abrasive materials.<br>
Fig. 3 and fig. 4 describe general assembly and layout.<br><br><br>
Now referring to figure 1, wherein the said mechanism comprises of a spring loading unit The movable outer body (1) over a barrel which has an inclined slot (2) in which an indicator-cum-locking system (3) is placed. The said indicator indicates the position of the pressing pin (4) and also the extent of wear of seal plate. The indicator shows when the seal plate is due for replacement. * Pressing pin (4) is pressing against the seal runner (5). The indicator (3) will have two extreme positions as shown by (3d &amp; 3u). That is (3 down) &amp; (3 up). The pin (4) is movable and adjustable and is protruding through dust guard (6) fixing-ring (7) to which spring loading unit is attached by suitable screw mechanism (8). The seal runner (5) is pressing against or on seal plate (9). The seal plate, when worn out beyond designed limits, is then replaced.<br>
Now referring to figure 2, wherein the special purpose tool consists of a holder (31) in form of a ring. The special purpose tool has dimensions matching to those of seal runner (shown in fig.l). The said holder ring is divided into at least two parts that is in two halves (31a) and (31b). The inner diameter of the said holder ring is slightly more than the outer diameter of the said dust guard (6) mentioned in the figure 1. The ring holder is made to rotate around the dust guard. Bearings are placed suitably within plurality of places (32.1, 32.2, 32.3, 32.4,...) within the ring holder. Therefore, while rotating the special purpose tool, the inner surface or edges of the holding ring does not damage the outer surface of the dust guard. The holding ring has plurality of recesses in which files (36) or file like abrasive materials are located and fixed in such a way that the filing faces are in one plane and protruding out of the working surface (37) of the said holding ring. The holding ring is provided with plurality of suitable knurled handles (38). The said parts or halves of the said holding ring are assembled by means of locating pins and holding screws by known methods.<br><br><br>
When said special purpose tool is introduced, placed and fixed together above the seal plate, the said special purpose tool is made to rotate in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions so that the top surface of the seal plate is flattened. The said special purpose tool has file like action thereby removing all uneven spots, high points and high portions of the seal plate. When the desired flatness is achieved, the said special purpose tool is removed.<br>
After removal 6f said special purpose tool the seal runner is introduced, shoulder screws are fixed, and the assembly is completed with the chamber.<br>
Now referring to figures 3 and 4 wherein, the mounting plate (44) with pre-fixed seal plate (9) [as given in the figure 1] is now introduced. The said mounting plate is fixed onto the upper bearing housing cover (39). The top surface (43) of the said seal plate (9) can now be seen and machined with special purpose tool in-situ. The said top surface is made flat and in one plane. The said tool is then removed. Seal runner is introduced and assembled by known methods. Thereafter the chamber (40) is assembled and fixed. The said spring loading units are then released. A spring loading unit is shown by (1). Assembly is then completed by known methods.
