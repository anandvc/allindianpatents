GAS DIFFUSION ELECTRODES, MEMBRANE-ELECTRODE ASSEMBLIES<br>
AND METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is relative to gas diffusion electrodes for use in fuel cells and<br>
other electrochemical applications, and to the relevant method of production.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are considered to be one of the<br>
most promising sources of clean electrical energy for the near future. PEMFC<br>
are electrochemical generators which produce direct electrical current from a<br>
gaseous fuel (typically hydrogen, pure or in admixture) and a gaseous oxidant,<br>
normally consisting of oxygen or air. The core component of the cell is the<br>
membrane-electrode assembly, consisting of an ion-exchange membrane,<br>
which is the solid electrolyte supporting the whole process and the physical<br>
separator of the anode and cathode cell compartments, bonded or otherwise<br>
coupled to gas diffusion electrodes. The gas diffusion electrodes, one cathode<br>
and one anode contacting either side of the ion-exchange membrane, usually<br>
comprise a gas diffusion medium and a catalysed layer. Several kinds of<br>
technical solutions are known from the prior art for these components: the<br>
catalysed layers are in some cases applied to the gas diffusion media prior to<br>
the coupling with the membrane, and/or they are directly coated on the<br>
membrane surface prior to the application of uncatalysed gas diffusion media<br>
thereon. The gas diffusion medium usually comprises an electrically conductive<br>
web and one or more gas diffusion layers; the conductive web can be metallic<br>
or carbon-based, and may consist of a metal mesh, foam or cloth, of a woven or<br>
non-woven carbon cloth, of a carbon paper or of any other preferably porous or<br>
perforated medium. Gas diffusion layers are provided to supply suitable paths<br>
for the diffusion of gaseous reactants inside the electrode structure toward the<br>
catalytic sites whereupon the electrochemical reactions of fuel oxidation (anode<br>
side) and oxidant reduction (cathode side) occur: they are usually based on<br>
mixtures of electrically conductive inert fillers (for instance carbon particles) and<br>
suitable, preferably hydrophobic binders (for instance PTFE or other fluorinated<br><br><br>
binders). Gas diffusion layers should be carefully designed to provide a<br>
permeable and smooth structure, to ensure a correct apportionment of the<br>
gaseous reactants without incurring heavy mass transport penalties, and to<br>
provide a good contact with the membrane. Improved gas diffusion structures<br>
for fuel cells are for instance disclosed in US 6,103,077. A catalysed layer can<br>
then be applied to the gas diffusion layers, for instance as described in US<br>
6,017,650; catalysed layers of the prior art comprise noble metal catalysts such<br>
as platinum, optionally supported on carbon or graphite particles, a suitable<br>
binder, which can be the same hydrophobic binder already present in the gas<br>
diffusion layers, and an ionomeric component, usually an ionomeric<br>
perfluorocarbon species. The ionomeric component can be added to the<br>
catalyst-binder mixture and/or it can be applied subsequently as an external<br>
layer wetting the pre-applied catalyst and binder particles. Gas diffusion<br>
electrodes of this kind, coupled to proton-exchange membranes known in the<br>
art, for instance based on fluorocarbon acids such as Nafion® (a trade-mark of<br>
U.S. company DuPont), give rise to membrane-electrode assemblies<br>
characterised by excellent performances; nevertheless, the noble metal<br>
component is exploited to such a low extent in structures of this kind, that very<br>
high specific loadings are required (usually in the range of 0.3 to 1 mg/cmz of<br>
platinum both for the anode and for the cathode side in commercially available<br>
products). The high amount of noble metal required for obtaining suitable<br>
performances in fuel cells is perhaps the single most important factor preventing<br>
PEMFC (and other types of fuel cells such as DMFC, direct methanol fuel cells)<br>
from having a commercial success. Direct metallisation of ion-exchange<br>
membranes with a catalyst layer has been proposed as a means to achieve a<br>
better catalyst-membrane interface, allowing a better catalyst exploitation and<br>
therefore the use of lower noble metal loadings. However, no means for direct<br>
metallisation of membranes has proven effective and practical up to now. High<br>
temperatures required by sputtering or ultra high vacuum deposition (UHV) are<br>
destined to impart consistent damages to the delicate ion-exchange<br>
membranes, and even the common physical and chemical vapour deposition<br>
techniques (PVD or CVD) have proven too difficult to control and cumbersome<br><br><br>
to scale up. A substantial improvement in the metallisation of membranes is<br>
disclosed in US 6,077,621, wherein the use of dual IBAD is proposed for this<br>
purpose. Dual IBAD, which is an evolution of the Ion Beam Assisted Deposition<br>
(IBAD) technique, has the advantage of being a low temperature process, very<br>
easy to scale up. The membrane is initially cleaned and textured by a first low-<br>
energy ion beam, for instance an Ar+ beam, having an energy not higher than<br>
500 eV; a second beam is then focused on the membrane, containing higher<br>
energy ions (such as O2+ or N2+) together with the ions of the metals to be<br>
deposited, previously evaporated by means of an electron beam. Dual IBAD is<br>
much advantageous also over conventional IBAD (in which a single beam is<br>
used), in that it allows the formation of a better controlled film with the required<br>
density and porosity while imparting a minimum stress to the membrane<br>
structure. Since the handling of a large sized ion-exchange membrane in a<br>
continuous metallisation process is not very easy, a further improvement of this<br>
technique has been disclosed in US 6,673,127: in this case, a very thin ion-<br>
exchange membrane layer is formed on a gas diffusion structure, and then<br>
subjected to dual IBAD. Although this technique allows to obtain high power<br>
densities in fuel cells with reduced platinum loadings, it still presents some<br>
disadvantages that the present invention wishes to address. Firstly, although<br>
the performances of these electrodes can be high, they can be somehow<br>
unpredictable since the reliability of this technique is affected by the<br>
characteristics of the ionomer film, which can vary according to the preparation<br>
conditions. The state-of-the-art liquid ionomer film is of fluorocarbonic nature,<br>
since this is the only known ionomeric material that would allow high power<br>
density operation, and it has to be recast from an alcoholic or hydroalcoholic<br>
suspension of a fluorocarbon acid such as the product commercialised as<br>
"Liquid Nation" by DuPont. The nature of these suspensions is not always<br>
consistent, since average molecular weight, morphological parameters of the<br>
suspended particles, rheological parameters and other factors may vary in a<br>
remarkable fashion from one batch to the other. Moreover, also in the best<br>
cases, the utilisation factor of the catalyst with liquid ionomer-embedded<br>
particles does never approach unity. Liquid ionomers for gas diffusion<br><br>
electrodes were first described in US 4,876,115 as a means for extending the<br>
proton conduction paths within the interstitial spaces of a three-dimensional<br>
catalytic layer thereby improving the utilisation factor of the catalyst (which is a<br>
measure of the availability and accessibility of the catalyst itself as a site for the<br>
desired reaction). This approach is effective up to a certain extent, only<br>
mimicking the ideal situation whereby all the catalyst is present in a very thin<br>
and smooth, quasi-two-dimensional layer, in direct contact with the membrane<br>
surface. Besides solving the issue of lowering the platinum loading (or more<br>
generally the noble metal loading) in fuel cell electrodes, another problem which<br>
should be addressed is the low stability of fluorocarbon-based ionomeric<br>
components in membrane-electrode assemblies at certain process conditions.<br>
In some applications (such as automotive ones), fuel cells are operated in a<br>
discontinuous fashion depending on the instant power demand; since PEMFC<br>
are known for their very quick start-up and their remarkable ability of following<br>
the requirements of steeply variable power demand, they are the most<br>
promising candidate for operating in this field. However, in conditions of zero or<br>
near-zero power demand, i.e. when little or no current is generated (open circuit<br>
voltage conditions), a consistent generation of peroxides on the anode side is<br>
likely to take place. Perfluorocarbon materials are often unstable in these<br>
conditions, especially over long times. Also for this reasons, alternative<br>
membranes (for instance based on polybenzimidazole, polyetherketones or<br>
polysulphones) have been developed for fuel cell applications. In any case,<br>
none of this materials has proven suitable for being employed as a proton<br>
conducting material for the electrode interface according to the teaching of US<br>
4,876,115, and perfluorocarbon materials such as the aforementioned "Liquid<br>
Nation" are always used. The elimination of this component would therefore be<br>
beneficial for many reasons, not only of cost and reliability, but also of overall<br>
chemical stability at certain process conditions.<br>
For all the above reasons, direct metallisation of gas diffusion media was<br>
attempted with several different techniques in the past, with no major success.<br>
Although, for instance, US 6,159,533 claims that excellent performances are<br>
obtainable with a PVD deposition of platinum on a gas diffusion medium, the<br><br>
examples show that the actual recorded performances don't go beyond a<br>
modest 732 mA/cm2 at 0.358 V in a fuel cell provided with a very thin<br>
membrane (20 microns), fed with a very high gas flow-rate (3.5 stoichiometric<br>
ratio on air, 2 stoichiometric ratio on pure hydrogen) at a relatively high pressure<br>
(about 2 bar).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a gas diffusion electrode<br>
overcoming the limitations of the prior art.<br>
Under another aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a gas<br>
diffusion electrode obtained by direct metallisation of a gas diffusion medium<br>
with low platinum loading and of high performances, preferably free of<br>
ionomeric fluorocarbon components, and a membrane-electrode assembly<br>
incorporating the same.<br>
Under yet another aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for forming a noble metal coating on a gas diffusion medium by direct<br>
metallisation.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Under a first aspect, the gas diffusion electrode of the invention consists of a<br>
gas diffusion medium free of ionomeric components provided with a noble metal<br>
coating by means of a dual IBAD deposition. The inventors have surprisingly<br>
found that, contrarily to other direct metallisation techniques such as sputtering<br>
or PVD, dual IBAD is capable of forming thin and smooth noble metal coatings,<br>
in particular platinum coatings, with no damage to the underlying substrate and<br>
with excellent electrochemical characteristics. Even more surprisingly, the<br>
catalyst utilisation factor (which is a measure of the catalytic effectiveness of the<br>
deposited noble metal coating) is not only much higher than in the electrodes of<br>
the prior art, but it is achieved without resorting to proton conducting materials<br>
in accordance with the teaching of US 4,876,115. More surprisingly, the<br>
inventor have found that the optional addition of suspensions of proton<br>
conducting materials in accordance with the teaching of US 4,876,115 is in<br>
most of the cases detrimental for the performances: a characterisation by<br><br>
voltammetry of the electrode of the invention coated with platinum in<br>
accordance with the invention showed that the addition of a 0.5 mg/cm2 layer of<br>
Liquid Nation decreases the Pt surface availability to a remarkable extent. The<br>
smoothness and density of the dual IBAD-applied noble metal coating is of<br>
great importance for obtaining a highly performant electrode: especially in the<br>
case of platinum, the best results are obtained employing a first low-energy<br>
beam of 100-500 eV, to clean and texture the surface of the gas diffusion<br>
medium, and a second high-energy beam, preferably of 500-2000 eV, of<br>
vaporised metal ions, in order to obtain a coating with a thickness preferably<br>
comprised between 5 and 500 nm and a loading preferably comprised between<br>
0.01 and 0.1 mg/cm2. In the present description, platinum is cited as an<br>
exemplary catalyst material for the gas diffusion electrode of the invention, but<br>
all other noble metals or combinations of different metals, noble and non noble,<br>
can be used.<br>
The nature of the gas diffusion medium is of utmost importance to obtain the<br>
required electrochemical performances with very low noble metal loadings; in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the gas diffusion medium whereto the noble metal<br>
coating of the invention is applied is obtained on a conductive web, for instance<br>
a metal or carbon cloth or a carbon paper, previously coated with a gas<br>
diffusion layer comprising an electroconductive filter optionally consisting of<br>
carbon particles or fibres and a binder, preferably a hydrophobic, optionally<br>
fluorinated binder. The best results can be obtained making use of very smooth<br>
gas diffusion media, preferably of gas diffusion media with a smoothness higher<br>
that 1000 Gurley seconds, and most preferably higher than 5000 Gurley<br>
seconds. Such high levels of smoothness are for instance obtainable by<br>
gravure-coating or other types of machine coating of inks of acetylene black<br>
carbon particles and PTFE or other equivalent fluorinated binders, optionally<br>
employing suitable smoothing additives as disclosed in a co-pending provisional<br>
patent application by the same applicant.<br>
The gas diffusion electrode of the invention is particularly suited to be<br>
incorporated in a membrane-electrode assembly structure, preferably by<br>
binding to an ion-exchange membrane, optionally by hot pressing as known in<br><br>
the art. In a preferred embodiment, the ion-exchange membrane is of the non<br>
fluorinated type, for instance based on polybenzimidazole, polyetherketones or<br>
polysulphones, so that no fluorocarbon component is present in the obtained<br>
membrane-electrode assembly.<br>
The membrane-electrode assembly obtained in accordance with the invention<br>
has superior performances when used in PEMFC even with very low platinum<br>
loadings, but can also be useful for other types of fuel cells such as DMFC<br>
(direct methanol fuel cells) or for other electrochemical applications such as<br>
membrane electrolysis. <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE	<br>
Figure 1 shows the voltammetric curves of the electrode of the invention before<br>
and after applying a coat of Liquid Nation suspension.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A gas diffusion medium was selected consisting of a three-dimensional woven<br>
carbon cloth coated with a mixture of Shawinigan Acetylene Black carbon<br>
particles and PTFE, for a total thickness of 410 microns, a basis weight of 210<br>
g/m2, a density of 0.54 g/cm3, an electrical resistivity of 525 mΩcm, an air<br>
permeability of 0.84 Gurley and a porosity of 25 microns with a mean pore size<br>
of 6 microns. The gas diffusion layer had improved tensile properties and<br>
surface roughness perfectly suiting the subsequent superficial metal deposition;<br>
in particular, a standard smoothness test gave a value of 5000 Gurley seconds.<br>
The gas diffusion medium so obtained was subjected to dual IBAD deposition of<br>
platinum metal: the sample was first subjected to a first low-energy beam of 200<br>
to 500 eV, to clean and partially texture the surface, then to platinum ions in a<br>
gaseous phase, extracted from a plasma and accelerated into a growing<br>
platinum coating on the gas diffusion layer surface at energies of 1000-2000 eV.<br>
Ion bombardment is the key factor controlling film properties in the IBAD<br>
process, imparting a substantial energy to the coating and the coating/substrate<br>
interface. This achieves the benefits of substrate heating (which generally<br>
provides a denser, more uniform film) without significantly heating the<br>
underlying gas-diffusion material which might degrade the bulk properties<br>
thereof. The ions also interact with coating atoms, driving them into the<br><br>
substrate and producing a graded material interface, which enhances adhesion.<br>
A total deposition of 0.04 mg/cm2 was obtained, corresponding to an overall<br>
thickness of 25 nm.<br>
Two small pieces were cut away form the sample, one of which was coated with<br>
0.5 mg/cmz of Liquid Nafion as known in the art. Cyclic voltammetry was carried<br>
out on both the coated and the uncoated sample, as shown in figure 1, wherein<br>
(1) indicates the curve relative to the latter and (2) the one relative to the former.<br>
It is evident how, notwithstanding the teachings of the prior art, the available<br>
surface area appears to be decreased by the Nafion coating.<br>
The remaining uncoated electrode was used to prepare a membrane-electrode<br>
assembly, upon bonding it via hot pressing procedure (for 10 minutes at 120°C<br>
and 25 bar a) to a Nafion® 112 membrane in "sandwich-like" fashion. Contrarily<br>
to the conventional MEA assemblies known in the art, no extra liquid ionomer<br>
was hence present in the manufactured MEA. In a subsequent fuel cell<br>
characterisation, it was possible to generate 0.3 A/cm2 at about 0.8 V and 0.7<br>
A/cm2 at about 0.7 V feeding pure hydrogen and air at 1.5 bar a, at a<br>
stoichiometric ratio of 2 and with a cell temperature of 80°C.<br>
The above description shall not be understood as limiting the invention, which<br>
may be practised according to different embodiments without departing from the<br>
scopes thereof, and whose extent is solely defined by the appended claims.<br>
In the description and claims of the present application, the word "comprise"<br>
and its variations such as "comprising" and "comprised" are not intended to<br>
exclude the presence of other elements or additional components.<br><br>
