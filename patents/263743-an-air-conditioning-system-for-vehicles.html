				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an air conditioning system for vehicles, and, more specifically, to an air conditioning system for vehicles which uses a specified plate-like member as a damper capable of opening/closing air discharge ports depending on respective air conditioning modes or an air mixing damper capable of controlling air path for temperature controlled air in an air duct.<br>
An air conditioning system for vehicles, which has a plurality of air discharge ports for respective air conditioning modes on an air duct, is well known. In such an air conditioning system, in order to open/close the respective air discharge ports, swing-type dampers are provided in accordance with the respective air discharge ports and the opening/closing operations of the respective air discharge ports are carried out by the control of the rotation of the respective swing-type dampers depending upon required air conditioning modes.<br>
Further, an air conditioning system for vehicles, which has an air mixing damper in an air duct for adjusting the rate of the amount of air passing through a cold air path to the amount of air passing through a hot air path, is also well known. Also in such an air conditioning system for vehicles, a swing-type damper is used as the air mixing damper for control of air temperature.<br>
Recently, the requirement for miniaturizing an air conditioning system for vehicles has been increased. To satisfy such a requirement, for example, a structure is proposed wherein a slide-type damper having a shutter configuration is provided instead of the above-described swing-type damper (for example, JP-A-7-103559). Further, another structure is also proposed wherein a rotary-type damper constructed by fixing a flexible film to a skeleton formed as a schematic arc in cross section is provided (for example, JP-A-9-99725).<br>
However, in the above-described proposed structure for providing a slide-type damper, an extending space in the vertical direction or horizontal direction for operating the damper is required. Further, because a link-lever mechanism is employed as a damper drive mechanism, the structure may become complicated. On the other hand, in the above-described proposed structure for providing a rotary-type damper, because it is<br>
necessary to enlarge an opening of the damper in order to ensure a sufficient amount of air, the size of the damper itself may become large.  Moreover, in both proposed structures, there is a problem that the design freedom on movement style and the movement direction of the damper is greatly restricted.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an air conditioning system for vehicles having an air discharge port control mechanism or/and an air mixing control mechanism which<br>
can greatly increase the design freedom in an air duct while achieving a simple structure with respect to a damper means and a damper driving means for adjusting an opening rate of each air discharge port depending upon a required air conditioning mode or for adjusting an air mixing rate of hot air to cold air, thereby sufficiently coping with the requirement for miniaturization of the damper, the damper drive mechanism, and ultimately the whole of the air conditioning system.<br>
The object is solved by the air conditioning system for vehicles of claims 1 and 6.  The air conditioning system for vehicles according to the present invention comprises an air duct which has a plurality of air discharge ports for respective air conditioning modes, and is characterized in that a plate-like member, which is movable in its longitudinal direction and has a flexibility in its longitudinal direction and a rigidity in its transverse direction, is provided in the air duct for controlling the opening/closing operations of respective air discharge ports in accordance with respective required air conditioning modes, so that the plate-like member can be wound in the air duct into a cylindrical form (a first invention).<br>
In the air conditioning system according to the first invention, in order to wind the plate-like member in a form of cylindrical shape, for example, a structure may be employed wherein at least one surface of the plate-like member is formed<br>
as a concave/convex structure in which concave portions and convex portions are alternately arranged in the longitudinal direction of the plate-like member, and the plate-like member is wound by a gear capable of engaging the concave/convex structure.  As such a gear, a drive gear for controlling the movement of the plate-like member may be used.  In this case, increase of the number of parts can be prevented, and increase of cost for manufacture may be suppressed.<br>
Further, a structure may be employed wherein an air path is formed in a portion for winding the plate-like member into a cylindrical form (a plate-like member winding portion).  In such a structure, the space inside of the air duct may be efficiently utilized, and the air duct, ultimately, the whole of the system may be further reduced in size.<br>
Furthermore, a structure may be employed wherein an airflow direction control plate is provided on a gear shaft of the gear.  In such a structure, because the air-flow direction control plate may be rotated in accordance with the required air conditioning mode accompanying with the rotation of the gear, a desirable air-flow direction is given to air passing through the air path formed in the plate-like member winding portion.<br>
Another air conditioning system for vehicles according to the present invention comprises an air duct which has a plurality of air discharge ports for respective air conditioning modes, and is characterized in that a plate-like<br>
member, which is movable in its longitudinal direction and which has a concave/convex structure, in that concave portions and convex portions are alternately arranged in its longitudinal direction, on at least one surface thereof, is provided in the air duct for controlling air path within the inside of the air duct, and a drive mechanism for moving the plate-like member comprises at least a gear engaging the concave/convex structure, a drive shaft being rotated integrally with the gear, a pulley provided at an end of the drive shaft, and a driving wire transmitting a driving force to the pulley (a second invention).<br>
In the air conditioning system according to the second invention, it is preferred that the pulley is provided at a position outside of the air duct.  Since the moving route of the driving wire for transmitting a driving force to the pulley can be formed outside of the air duct by providing the pulley at a position outside of the air duct, the air duct may be made smaller as well as the workability for assembly of the system into a vehicle may be improved.<br>
In order to efficiently transmit a driving force to the pulley and form a drive mechanism having a high reliability, it is necessary to prevent a slipping of the driving wire connected to the pulley.  Therefore, it is preferred that the driving wire is wound on the pulley by at least one winding time. Further, in order to prevent the slipping of the driving wire<br>
surely, it is preferred to provide a lock mechanism to the pulley for preventing a slipping of the driving wire.<br>
It is possible that the above-described driving wire is connected directly to a temperature adjusting lever for adjusting a temperature in the air duct or a mode switching lever for selectively opening/closing respective air discharge ports in accordance with required air conditioning modes. Namely, in a case where the above-described plate-like member is an air mixing damper, the driving wire is connected directly to a temperature adjusting lever.  On the other hand, in a case where the above-described plate-like member is an air discharge port opening/closing control damper, the driving wire is connected directly to a mode switching lever.  In such a structure, the damper drive mechanism may be further simplified.<br>
Further, in the system according to the second invention, it is preferred that a tension giving mechanism is provided at a position on the way of a moving route of the driving wire for giving a tension to the driving wire.  This tension giving mechanism may be provided, for example, in a control unit of the air conditioning system into which the above-described temperature adjusting lever and the mode switching lever are incorporated.<br>
In the air conditioning system according to the above-described first invention, because the plate-like member for controlling the openeing/closing operations of the respective<br>
air discharge ports is constructed as a member having a flexibility in its longitudinal direction (movement direction) and a rigidity in its transverse direction, the plate-like member can be curved substantially freely in the direction to be moved, and the plate-like member is provided so that it can be wound in a cylindrical form.  Therefore, the design freedom of the air discharge port openeing/closing control means may be greatly increased.  Further, since the installation space and the movement space of the plate-like member in the air duct can be greatly reduced, it becomes possible to make the air duct small-sized, ultimately, to make the whole of the air conditioning system small-sized.<br>
In the air conditioning system according to the above-described second invention, because the plate-like member capable of functioning as an air mixing damper or an air discharge port openeing/closing control damper is constructed as a member having a concave/convex structure on its at least one surface and having a flexibility in its longitudinal direction<br>
(movement direction), by engaging the gear with the concave/convex structure, providing a pulley at the end of a drive shaft fixed with the gear, winding a driving wire around the pulley and giving a driving force to the driving wire, the gear is rotated accompanying with the rotation of the pulley and the drive shaft, and the plate-like member may be moved smoothly in its longitudinal direction.  Therefore, the drive<br>
mechanism for moving the plate-like member may be constructed simply as compared with that of the conventional damper drive mechanism.  Further, because the plate-like member can be curved substantially freely in its longitudinal direction, the installation space and the movement space of the plate-like member in the air duct may be greatly reduced, and it becomes possible to make the air duct small-sized, ultimately, to make the whole of the air conditioning system small-sized.<br>

Figs. 1 to 15 show an air conditioning system for vehicles according to a first embodiment of the present invention.  In the air conditioning system for vehicles shown in Fig. 1, an evaporator 2 of refrigerant as a cooler and a heater 3 are disposed in an air duct 1 in order from the lower part of the figure.  A hot air path 4 for sending air, which has passed through evaporator 2, into heater and a cold air path 5 for sending the air bypassing heater 3 are formed between evaporator 2 and heater 3.<br>
An air rate adjusting plate-like member 6 for adjusting the rate of air passing through hot air path 4 to air passing through cold air path 5, that is, functioning as an air mixing damper, is provided between evaporator 2 and heater 3.  This air rate adjusting plate-like member 6 has a structure similar to that of a plate-like member 17 described later for opening/closing air discharge ports, that has a flexibility in its longitudinal direction (movement direction) and a rigidity in its transverse direction.  Air rate adjusting plate-like member 6 is provided movably in the left and right directions<br>
accompanying with the rotation of a gear 7, and it is guided along a guide path 8 formed as a groove.  In this embodiment, the guide path 8 is provided on each side of air rate adjusting plate-like member 6 in the transverse direction of the air rate adjusting plate-like member 6.<br>
Respective air discharge ports for respective air conditioning modes are formed on air duct 1 at positions downstream of heater 3.  As depicted in Fig. 2, VENT mode air discharge port 9 comprises three air discharge ports arranged in the transverse direction of air duct 1, and concretely, comprises a center VENT mode air discharge port 10 opened on a central portion and side VENT mode air discharge ports 11 and 12 provided on both sides thereof.  Further, a DEF mode air discharge port 13 is opened on the same surface 16a of air duct 1 as that provided with the above-described VENT mode air discharge port 9.  Furthermore, FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are opened on a surface 16b different from surface 16a provided with VENT mode air discharge port 9 and DEF mode air discharge port 13.<br>
The above-described respective air discharge ports are controlled to be opened/closed by a plate-like member 17 in accordance with respective air conditioning modes.  Plate-like member 17 (and plate-like member 6) is constructed in a form as shown in Figs. 3 to 5, and it has a flexibility in its longitudinal direction A (movement direction) and a rigidity<br>
in its transverse direction.  As the raw material of plate-like member 17, for example, a resin having a flexibility is used, and the above-described flexibility of plate-like member 17 is provided by the flexibility of the resin.  The rigidity in the transverse direction of plate-like member 17 is structurally provided by surface concaves and convexes.<br>
In this embodiment, one surface 18 of plate-like member 17 is formed substantially as a plane (the lower surface in Figs. 3 and 5), and the other surface is formed as a concave/convex structure 21 in which convex portions 19 and concave portions 20 extending in the transverse direction crossing with the movement direction A (in this embodiment, a direction perpendicular to the movement direction A) are arranged alternately in the movement direction A and connected to each other.  In this concave/convex structure 21, convex portions 19 and concave portions 20 are arranged regularly and alternately, and the surface of the concave/convex structure 21 can engage with a gear or a gear-like member.  Further, in this embodiment, each convex portion 19 is formed as a hollow structure (hollow portion 22), and plate-like member 17 may be lightened.  This plate-like member 17 is slid along groove-like guide paths 24 provided on both sides of the member by rotating drive gears 23 (Fig. 1) which engage with concave/convex structure 21 of platelike member 17 at both end portions of the plate-like member 17 in the transverse direction.  By this movement of plate-like<br>
member 17, respective air discharge ports are controlled to be opened and closed.  Each guide path 24 has a curved portion 34 which is formed as a cylindrical form and extends around each drive gear 23, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
A plurality of openings are provided on plate-like member 17 for opening/closing respective air discharge ports.  In this embodiment, three openings are provided on plate-like member 17. As shown in Fig. 4, openings 25, 26 and 27 are provided so that they are arranged in the transverse direction of plate-like member 17.  Openings 25 and 27 have the same shape and opening 26 has a different shape.  Further, in this embodiment, openings 25, 26 and 27 are arranged so that they are overlapped with each other with respect to position in the longitudinal direction of plate-like member 17.  Furthermore, respective edges 28 and 29 of plate-like member 17 in the longitudinal direction are formed as a round shape, as shown in Fig. 5.  By providing such a round, more smooth movement of plate-like member 17 along guide paths 24 may be ensured.<br>
Plate-like member 17 is provided so that it can be wound in a cylindrical form in air duct 1 as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Namely, when drive gear 23 is driven, plate-like member 17 is moved along curved portion 34 of guide path 24 from the side of edge 28 in the movement direction and wound on the periphery of drive gear 23, and the plate-like member 17 is wound in a cylindrical form.<br>
The inside portion of winding portion 33, in which platelike member 17 is wound in a cylindrical form, may be utilized as air path 30 directing air toward respective air discharge ports.  Further, on gear shaft 31 of drive gear 23, an air-flow direction control plate 32 is provided for giving a desirable air-flow direction to air passing through air path 30 in accordance with a required air conditioning mode.  Air-flow direction control plate 32 extends in the axial direction of gear shaft 31.  Air-flow direction control plate 32 is rotated accompanying with the rotation of gear shaft 31.<br>
Next, the sliding condition of plate-like member 17 and the control of the movement of the plate-like member 17 for opening/closing respective air discharge ports in this embodiment will be explained referring to Figs. 6 to 15 depicting respective air conditioning modes.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show a state at the time of a VENT mode.  In this VENT mode, edge 29 of plate-like member 17 is positioned between VENT mode air discharge port 9 (air discharge ports 10, 11 and 12) and DEF mode air discharge port 13, and only VENT mode air discharge port 9 is opened so as to realize the required air conditioning mode of VENT mode.  In this VENT mode, the whole of plate-like member 17 is positioned within curved portion 34 of guide path 24 and wound in a cylindrical form.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show a state at the time of a BILEVEL mode. In this BILEVEL mode, edge 29 of plate-like member 17 is moved<br>
up to a position of a VENT mode air discharge port side (right side in Fig. 8) as compared with the position in the above-described VENT mode, and respective VENT mode air discharge ports 10, 11 and 12 are partially closed.  Further, openings 25 and 27 and FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are partially overlapped with each other, and the FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are partially opened.  Thus, both of VENT mode air discharge port 9 and FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are partially opened so as to realize the required air conditioning mode of BILEVEL mode.  In this BILEVEL mode, as shown in Fig. 9, hot air having passed through heater 3 passes through air path 30 formed inside of winding portion 33 of cylindrically wound plate-like member 17 and is blown out from FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15.  Further, because air-flow direction control plate 32 is rotated at a position for giving an air-flow directed to the FOOT mode air discharge ports to hot air flowing into air path 30 from the side of edge 28 of plate-like member 17, a desired air-flow direction is given for the BILEVEL mode.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 show a state at the time of a FOOT mode. In this FOOT mode, edge 29 of plate-like member 17 is further moved up to a right-side position in Fig. 10 as compared with the position in the above-described BILEVEL mode, and the whole of VENT mode air discharge ports 9 is completely closed.  On the other hand, opening 26 and DEF mode air discharge port 13<br>
are partially overlapped, and the DEF mode air discharge port 13 is partially opened.  Further, a part of opening 25 is overlapped with the whole of FOOT mode air discharge port 15, a part of opening 27 is overlapped with the whole of FOOT mode air discharge port 14, and the FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are fully opened.  Thus, the required air conditioning mode of FOOT mode can be realized.  Further, because DEF mode air discharge port 13 is partially opened in this FOOT mode, cloud of a front glass, etc. in a vehicle interior may be prevented.<br>
Also in this FOOT mode, as shown in Fig. 11, a desired airflow direction directed to FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 and DEF mode air discharge port 13 is given to air flown into air path 30 from the side of edge 28 of plate-like member 17, by air-flow direction control plate 32.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 show a state at the time of a DEF-FOOT mode, In this DEF-FOOT mode, edge 29 of plate-like member 17 is further moved up to a right-side position in Fig. 12 as compared with the position in the above-described FOOT mode, and the amount of overlapping of opening 26 and DEF mode air discharge port 13 is enlarged so as to realize the required air conditioning mode of DEF-FOOT mode.<br>
In this DEF-FOOT mode, as shown in Fig. 13, since air-flow direction control plate 32 is rotated to a position giving an air-flow direction toward the side of DEF mode air discharge<br>
port 13 to air passing through air path 30 more strongly that in the above-described FOOT mode, air may be sent to the DEF mode air discharge port 13 and FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 with a good balance.<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 show a state at the time of a DEF mode.  In this DEF mode, edge 29 of plate-like member 17 is further moved up to a right-side position in Fig. 14 as compared with the position in the above-described DEF-FOOT mode, the amount of overlapping of openings 25 and 27 and FOOT mode air discharge ports 15 and 14 disappears, and the FOOT mode air discharge ports 14 and 15 are completely closed.  On the other hand, a part of opening 26 and the whole of DEF mode air discharge port 13 are overlapped, and the DEF mode air discharge port 13 is fully opened.  Thus, the required air conditioning mode of DEF mode can be realized.<br>
In this DEF mode, as shown in Fig. 15, since air-flow direction control plate 32 is rotated to a position closer the side of DEF mode air discharge port 13 than that of the above-described DEF-FOOT mode, air having once flown into air path 30 may be prevented from being flown along the inner surface of plate-like member 17 to reversely flow, and an air-flow direction toward DEF mode air discharge port 13 may be surely given.<br>
In the air conditioning system of the above-described embodiment, since plate-like member 17 having a flexibility in<br>
its longitudinal direction (movement direction) and a rigidity in its transverse direction is used as means for controlling the opening/closing operation of the respective air discharge ports, the plate-like member 17 can be freely bent in a direction to be moved.  Namely, because plate-like member 17 can be wound in a cylindrical form as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the design freedom may be greatly increased, and a large space or a particular space as a space for moving the plate-like member 17 may become unnecessary.  Therefore, it may become possible to make the air discharge port opening/closing control means small-sized, and ultimately to make the whole of the air conditioning system small-sized.<br>
Further, since a plurality of openings 25, 26 and 27 are provided on plate-like member 17 for controlling opening/closing operation of air discharge ports, the opening/closing conditions of respective air discharge ports corresponding to respective required air conditioning modes may be realized only by the control of movement of a single plate-like member 17.<br>
Further, by forming air path 30 in winding portion 33 of plate-like member 17 wound in a cylindrical form, the limited space in air duct 1 may be effectively utilized, and the air conditioning system may be made further small-sized.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-described embodiment, because plate-like member 17 is wound by drive gear 23 in a cylindrical form, a particular winding means is not necessary.  Therefore,<br>
increase of the system may be prevented.  Further, since airflow direction control plate 32 provided on gear shaft 31 is rotated to each position for giving a desirable air-flow direction in accordance with each required air conditioning mode, accompanying with the rotation of gear 23 as described above, a desirable air-flow direction may be given to air in air path 30.<br>
Next, an air conditioning system for vehicles according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained referring to Figs. 16 to 23.  The explanation of the same members and structures as those in the above-described first embodiment may be omitted by using the same labels as those in the first embodiment.  In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 17, air duct 1 is constructed from two side cases 31 and 32 connected to each other to form a heat exchange unit 100. Plate-like member 6 functioning as an air mixing damper in air duct 1 has a concave/convex structure 21 on at least one surface thereof similar to that of plate-like member 17 functioning as an air discharge port opening/closing control means, as shown in the aforementioned Fig. 3.  Further, an appropriate round is provided on each edge 28 or 29 of platelike member 6 in its longitudinal direction, as shown in the aforementioned Fig. 5.<br>
As shown in Fig. 18, concave/convex structure 21 of platelike member 6 (or plate-like member 17) engages drive gears 7<br>
(or drive gears 23) fixed to both ends of drive shaft 30a (or drive shaft 30b).  Plate-like member 6 (or plate-like member 17) can be moved in the arrow direction depicted in Fig. 18 accompanying with the rotation of drive gears 7 (or drive gears 23), and guided along groove-like guide path 8 (or groove-like guide path 24).  Groove-like guide path 8 (or groove-like guide path 24) is provided on each side of plate-like member 6 (or plate-like member 17).<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, an insertion hole 33 for plate-like member 6 and an insertion hole 34 for plate-like member 17 are opened on side surface 39 of side case 31 forming air duct 1, respectively.  Insertion hole 33 is opened and closed by cover 35, and insertion hole 34 is opened and closed by cover 36, respectively.  Insertion hole 37 for drive shaft 30a is provided on cover 35, and insertion hole 38 for drive shaft 30b is provided on cover 36, respectively.<br>
Drive shaft 30a (or drive shaft 30b) is supported free to rotate by bearing 40 provided on the side cases, as shown in Fig. 18.  Pulley 41 (or pulley 42) is provided on an end of drive shaft 30a (or drive shaft 30b).  These pulleys 41 and 42 are disposed at positions outside of air duct 1.<br>
Driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) for transmitting a driving force to pulley 41 (or pulley 42) is connected to the pulley 41 (or the pulley 42).  Driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) is wound at least one time around pulley 41 (or pulley 42).<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 20, driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) wound onto pulley 41 (or pulley 42) is once led out through slit 61 (or slit 62), and it is wound onto lock mechanism 63 (or lock mechanism 64) provided on the side surface of pulley 41 (or pulley 42).  Therefore, the slipping of driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) may be surely prevented. The lock mechanism is not limited to the above-described mechanism.  For example, as shown in Fig. 21, a structure may be employed for preventing the slipping, wherein holes 67 and 68<br>
(or holes 69 and 70) are provided on the side surface of pulley 41 (or pulley 42), and driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) is wound onto pulley 41 (or pulley 42) so as to be inserted into the holes.<br>
On the way of the route of driving wire 43, as shown in Fig, 22, a pulley 45 is provided as a mechanism for giving a tension to the driving wire 43.  A shaft 48 of a temperature adjusting lever 47 of control unit 46 of the air conditioning system is inserted into a hole 49 of pulley 45.  Namely, in this embodiment, driving wire 43 is substantially connected to temperature adjusting lever 47.  Therefore, by operating temperature adjusting lever 47, plate-like member 6 as an air mixing damper for adjusting the air amount rate between hot air path 4 and cold air path 5 is moved to adjust the temperature of air to be sent to the air discharge ports.  On the other hand, also on the way of the route of driving wire 44, as shown in Fig.<br>
22, pulley 50 is provided as a mechanism for giving a tension to the driving wire 44.  A shaft 52 of a mode switching lever 51 of control unit 46 of the air conditioning system is inserted into a hole 53 of pulley 50, and driving wire 44 is substantially connected to mode switching lever 51.  By operating mode switching lever 51, plate-like member 17 is moved to open/close the respective air discharge ports in accordance with the respective required air conditioning modes.<br>
A pulley 54 for driving a damper (not shown) for adjusting the rate of the amount of inside air to the amount of outside air in the inside and outside air introduction ports (not shown) is provided at a position outside of air duct 1.  A driving wire 55 is connected to pulley 54.  A pulley 56 is provided on the way of the route of driving wire 55 as a tension giving mechanism.  A shaft 59 of inside air/outside air switching lever 58 is inserted into a hole 57 of pulley 56.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, concave/convex structure 21 is provided to each of plate-like member 6 functioning as an air mixing damper and plate-like member 17 functioning as an air discharge port opening/closing control means, and a flexibility is given to each plate-like member in its longitudinal direction (movement direction).  Then, each platelike member may be properly moved by the operation of a drive mechanism comprising drive gear 7 or 23 engaging concave/convex structure 21, drive shaft 30a or 30b connected to the drive<br>
gear, pulley 41 or 42 connected to the drive shaft, and driving wire 43 or 44 wound onto the pulley for transmitting a driving force to the pulley via lever 47 or 51.  Therefore, the drive mechanism may be constructed as a simple damper drive mechanism 65 or 66 (Figs. 16 and 17) as compared with the conventional mechanism.  Moreover, similarly to in the first embodiment, because plate-like members 6 and 17 are curved freely in the longitudinal direction (movement direction), the installation space and the movement space thereof in air duct 1 may be reduced.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, because pulley 41 and pulley 42 are disposed outside of air duct 1, the routes of driving wires 43 and 44 may be formed outside of the air duct 1, and the size of the whole of the air conditioning system may be further reduced.<br>
Furthermore, since lock mechanism 63 (or lock mechanism 63) for preventing the slipping of connected driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) is provided to pulley 41 (pr pulley 42), the slipping of driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) may be surely prevented and a smooth movement of plate-like member 6 (or plate-like member 17) may be ensured, thereby increasing the reliability of the air conditioning system.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, since driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44) is substantially connected to temperature adjusting lever 47 (or mode switching lever 51) via pulley 45<br>
(or pulley 50), the drive mechanism of plate-like member 6 (or plate-like member 17) may be further simplified.  Further, since pulley 45 (or pulley 50) as a tension giving mechanism is provided on the way of the route of driving wire 43 (or driving wire 44), an appropriate tension may be always applied to the driving wire 43 (or the driving wire 44).  Therefore, a smooth and quick movement of plate-like member 6 (or plate-like member 17) may be ensured, and the reliability of the air conditioning system may be further increased.  Where, pulley 45 (or/and pulley 50 or/and pulley 56) as a tension giving mechanism may be provided in control unit 46 as shown in Fig. 11.  In the structure shown in Fig. 11, guide pins 71, 72 and 73 are provided for guiding respective driving wires 43, 44 and 55 to form respective appropriate routes of the driving wires.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the control of platelike member 17 for controlling the opening/closing of the respective air discharge ports in accordance with the respective required air conditioning modes may be carried out similarly to the manner in the aforementioned first embodiment, as shown in Figs. 6 to 15.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
