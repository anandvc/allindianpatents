				<td>Method and device for the preparation of mould sand<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for the preparation of mould<br>
sand using a mixing process in a mixer, wherein the preparation takes place, at least<br>
partially under vacuum.<br>
The preparation of sand for the manufacture of moulds is intended to produce the<br>
correct mixing ratio of grain sizes and of proportions of quartz sand, binding agent,<br>
coal dust, optionally other additives as well as recycled and new sand, to homogenise<br>
the mixture and, in this context, to coat the grains with the binding agent to a large<br>
extent, to adjust the correct moisture content, to adjust the correct temperature of the<br>
mould sand and finally to convey the ready-prepared sand to the places of use.<br>
Recycled sand generally has an increased temperature, for example, of between<br>
100°C and 140°C. Because sand temperatures above approximately 50°C can present<br>
considerable problems to the moulding equipment, and at excessively high<br>
temperatures, uncontrollable evaporation losses over the distance between the mixer<br>
and the moulding equipment can lead to fluctuations in moisture in the ready sand, the<br>
sand must be cooled in this case. Conveyor belt coolers, through which the sand<br>
passes continuously as a result of vibrating or agitating movements of a screen mesh,<br>
are mostly used for this purpose.<br>
An alternative cooling method has been proposed in DE 295 24 03 C2. This cooling<br>
method provides the concurrent preparation and cooling of clay-bound foundry<br>
moulding sands in a vacuum mixer. In this context, the individual components are<br>
initially placed into the mixer. After a short prehomogenizing process, the temperature<br>
and moisture of the mixture are measured and the necessary quantity of water is<br>
added. Finally, during the preparation process, the pressure in the mixture is gradually<br>
reduced. As soon as the pressure corresponds to the vapour pressure curve of water,<br>
the water in the sand begins to boil and removes the necessary evaporation heat from<br>
the sand. As a result, an extremely effective cooling method is achieved in an<br>
economical manner. According to the disclosure of DE 199 45 569, alongside the<br>
cooling effect on the mould sand, the described cooling of mould sand under vacuum<br>
also leads to an increase in quality of the mould sand prepared. Accordingly, DE 199<br>
45 569 suggests preparation under vacuum even for recycled sand which has already<br>
been cooled.<br>
It has been shown that the best mould sand quality can be achieved with the assistance<br>
of vacuum preparation. However, the known stages of the method and the devices<br>
and/or peripheral equipment used and their method of operation are suitable only to a<br>
limited extent.or not at all for use in a fully automated foundry moulding plant.<br>
According to experience, error-free and above all economically optimized operation is<br>
not possible with the known method.<br>
This is because, among other factors, the filling and emptying of the mixer is very<br>
time-consuming. For the ventilation of the mixer, a mixer cover is provided, in all<br>
known versions, which, in the closed condition, must be vacuum-tight to allow<br>
vacuum operation, and which is opened for the purpose of charging the mixer. In this<br>
context, the cover is generally connected to the mixer in a rotatable manner by means<br>
of a rotating axis. The cover can be designed in such a manner that it is rotated<br>
 outwards or inwards in order to open the container. If it is rotated inwards, the closing<br>
mechanism must press the cover outwards against the sealing surface of the mixer<br>
with considerable force during vacuum operation. In order to manufacture the closing<br>
mechanism in an economical manner, the mixer cover must therefore be very small,<br>
because only a small force need then be applied by the closing mechanism.<br>
If the cover is opened outwards, the closing mechanism can be designed to be weaker<br>
and can therefore be manufactured more economically, because the necessary<br>
pressing force can be generated by the pressure difference between the mixing<br>
container and the surroundings alone. However, with this version, the design must<br>
take into consideration that sufficient rotational clearance remains above the cover so<br>
that the cover can be opened without it coming into contact with any objects.<br>
Accordingly, dosage funnels or dosage devices must be attached at an appropriate<br>
distance above the mixer opening. This distance necessarily increases in proportion<br>
with the size of cover. However, when filling the mixer, it is important to ensure that<br>
the sealing surface of the charging opening remains as a free from contamination as<br>
possible, in order to guarantee a vacuum-tight closability. However, the probability of<br>
contamination of the sealing surface increases considerably as the distance between<br>
the dosage funnel and filling opening and/or the dropping height of the substance to<br>
be charged increases. For this reason, it is currently assumed, that a generic mixer<br>
cannot be manufactured economically with a large charging opening. Accordingly,<br>
the known mixers all possess only a relatively small opening in the pressure casing of<br>
the mixer, and, in the case of the equipment known so far, the mixture is added only<br>
in a very fine flow. This results in a very long charging time and therefore also a very<br>
low plant performance. If the mixer is loaded too quickly, an excess air pressure<br>
rapidly builds" up as a result of compression of the air in the mixer. This excess<br>
pressure generally leads to the emission from the mixer of dust-like components of the<br>
mixture, which can, for example, also be deposited on very sensitive machine<br>
components, such as cogwheels and gaskets. This means that the plant must be<br>
cleaned more frequently which, once again, is associated with higher costs and<br>
undesired interruptions of operation. For this reason, it has generally been considered<br>
that, on the one hand, the charging rate cannot be further increased, because larger<br>
input openings cannot be realized in an economical manner. And, on the other hand, it<br>
has been considered that a larger charging rate will lead to the disadvantages<br>
described and must therefore be avoided.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a method and a device for<br>
preparation of mould sand, which can be used economically without errors, and<br>
provides mould sands of uniform temperature and uniformly high quality in an<br>
economical manner and which, in comparison with the known mixers, has an<br>
increased charging rate.<br>
With regard to the method, this object is achieved by the material to be charged being<br>
added at least at times in a volume flow of at least 100-800 1/s through an opening<br>
with a diameter of at least 150 mm, preferably at least 300 mm, and particularly<br>
preferably at least 500 mm.<br>
In this context, the pressure difference between the ambient pressure and the pressure<br>
in the mixing chamber of the mixer is preferably used either as the exclusive or<br>
predominant drive for at least one feeder process for water or for a mixture<br>
component or for accelerating the feeder process. According to the invention,<br>
therefore, the dosage devices and charging devices are coupled with the mixing unit in<br>
terms of the design and method. As a result, the vacuum prevailing in the mixer can<br>
be used, for example, to accelerate the charging processes, and even during the<br>
charging phase, to improve the distribution of the additives and the fluids to be added.<br>
In particular in combination with a large charging opening, the consistent use of<br>
pressure difference can achieve a significant reduction in charging time. Moreover,<br>
this method causes no additional costs, because the evacuation device necessary for<br>
the preparation method is already present.<br>
Particularly preferred is a method in which at least a portion of the quality-<br>
determining mixture components is fed into the mixer during the charging and/or<br>
mixing process. The quality-determining mixture components are the additives<br>
already mentioned, such as, for example, bentonite, coal dust, etc., which are added to<br>
the recycled sand, in order to adjust the quality of the prepared mould sand. The<br>
vacuum pressure in the mixer, which is used to suck in the components to be filled,<br>
also effectively prevents the emission of dust-like mixture components from the mixer<br>
and their being deposited, for example, on sensitive machine parts.<br>
A particularly expedient version of the method according to the invention additionally<br>
provides that the individual mixture components are introduced into the mixer one<br>
after another according to a predetermined sequence. However, for special cases of<br>
application, it may be advantageous if the water is only introduced into the mixer after<br>
the other mixture components have been introduced into the mixer essentially<br>
concurrently. As a result, after the other mixture components have been introduced, it<br>
is possible to determine the residual moisture and temperature of the recycled sand<br>
and from this, to calculate the appropriate quantity of water to be added.<br>
In particular, in order to be able to mix the water to be added as well as possible with<br>
the mixture, a preferred version of the method provides that at least one portion of the<br>
water to be added is introduced directly into the mixture with the assistance of a<br>
preferably rotating feeder device. In this context, by rotating is meant rotating relative<br>
to the mixer, so that it is irrelevant whether the feeder device rotates or the feeder<br>
device remains stationary and the mixer rotates around the stationary feeder device, or<br>
whether both the mixer and the feeder device rotate. This direct method of feeding,<br>
that is, below the mixture level, can enable a very good mixing of the water with the<br>
mixture.<br>
A particularly effective version of the method provides that at least one portion of the<br>
water is introduced into the mixture via a feeder device, which is coupled with a<br>
mixing tool or even integrated into a mixing tool. This is particularly advantageous if<br>
the mixer already provides a mixing tool. Moreover, as a result of this stage of the<br>
method, the water can be mixed directly with the filling substance.<br>
It is also particularly expedient if the quality-determining mixture components, such<br>
as e.g. bentonite and coal dust, are introduced into the mixer below the filling level of<br>
the mixture. This measure also guarantees a very good mixing of the quality-<br>
determining mixture components with the mixture in the mixer.<br>
The quality-determining mixture components are preferably introduced centrally and<br>
directly inside the vertically and tangentially flowing mixture bed. This further<br>
enhances miscibility.<br>
For some cases of application, it may also be advantageous if at least one portion of<br>
the quality-determining mixture components is first mixed with air, and this air/solid<br>
mixture is then introduced into the mixer, i.e. preferably below the filling level. After<br>
preparation of the mould sand, the mixer must necessarily be ventilated again, that is,<br>
the pressure difference between the mixing container and the ambient pressure must<br>
be equalized. This can be achieved, for example, simply by opening the container<br>
cover. However, a method, in which the mixing chamber is ventilated via a feeder<br>
which terminates in the mixing chamber below the filling level of the mixture, is<br>
particularly preferred. As a result, the mould sand is compressed to a lesser extent. By<br>
contrast, if the equalization air is fed in above the sand level, a kind of pressure<br>
cushion will be formed on the surface of the sand as a result of the pressure difference<br>
prevailing above and below the filling substance, which leads to definite, temporary<br>
compression at least of the uppermost layer of sand.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to use the feeder, which is provided for feeding the<br>
quality-determining mixture components, for ventilation and/or pressure equalization.<br>
With regard to the device, the object mentioned initially is achieved by a device for<br>
the preparation of mould sand with a mixer, which has a vacuum chamber or is<br>
arranged in a vacuum chamber, which can be closed in an essentially vacuum-tight<br>
manner, with devices for feeding the components to be mixed, at least one mixing tool<br>
as well as a device for removing the ready mixture, wherein a closable feeder<br>
connection for the components to be mixed exists or can be manufactured between the<br>
mixing container and the outside, wherein the feeder opening has a cross-sectional<br>
area of at least 0.25 m2, preferably at least 0.4 m2 and particularly preferably at least<br>
0.5 m2.<br>
In principle, the feeder opening can have any cross-sectional form, round or<br>
rectangular forms being preferred, however.<br>
Feeding preferably takes place through the feeder opening either exclusively through<br>
the pressure difference between the ambient pressure and the pressure in the mixing<br>
chamber of the mixer, or feeding is at least accelerated by this pressure difference.<br>
Through this at least one closable feeder connection, the pressure difference between<br>
the ambient pressure and the pressure in the mixing chamber of the mixer can be<br>
exploited as a driving force. If the feeder connection is opened, as a result of the<br>
vacuum pressure existing in the mixing chamber, material to be supplied is drawn into<br>
the mixing container from the outside. In general, an additional pump is not<br>
necessary for this purpose. The feeder therefore requires no additional energy and is,<br>
moreover, essentially maintenance-free.<br>
Particularly preferred is a version in which an essentially vacuum-tight, closable<br>
filling opening of the mixer can be connected via an essentially vacuum-tight<br>
intermediate space to the outlet opening of at least one dosage device which is<br>
preferably designed as a dosage weighing device. Recycled sand, for example, can be<br>
introduced into the mixer through this opening. For this purpose, the mixer must first<br>
be placed under a vacuum. Following this, the filling opening of the mixer is opened,<br>
so that the mixing chamber is connected to the essentially vacuum-tight intermediate<br>
space. After this, the outlet opening of at least one feeder device is opened so that the<br>
charging materials from the feeder device are first conveyed into the intermediate<br>
space and then into the mixing chamber. This charging takes place very quickly<br>
because the pressure in the mixing chamber of the mixer and in the intermediate space<br>
is significantly lower than the pressure in the feeder device. Particularly preferably,<br>
the filling opening of the mixer and/or the outlet opening of the feeder device have a<br>
cover with lateral cheeks, which, with the assistance of the lateral cheeks, forms a<br>
kind of conveyor chute in the opened state. With the assistance of this conveyor chute,<br>
the supplied filling materials can be conveyed from the outlet opening of the feeder<br>
device at a high flow rate directly into the inlet opening of the mixer. Particularly<br>
preferably, the inlet opening of the mixer and also the outlet opening of the feeder<br>
device have a cover with lateral cheeks, each of which therefore form a conveyor<br>
chute in the opened state.<br>
For particular cases of application, it could be advantageous if a further movable<br>
chute component is provided, which can be moved independently of one of the<br>
covers. For the purpose of feeding in this case, the cover of the inlet opening of the<br>
mixer can first be opened, preferably by means of a control device, then the movable<br>
chute component can be brought into its functional position and finally the cover of<br>
the feeder device can be opened. The three chutes are then preferably arranged in such<br>
a manner that they form a passage for the substance to be filled and guarantee a rapid<br>
and targeted charging of the mixer with the substance to be filled. The chutes are<br>
preferably arranged in such a manner that they project into the openings and thereby<br>
prevent the substances to be filled from coming into contact with the edges of the<br>
opening. Contact of this kind could, under some circumstances, impair the sealing<br>
function of the cover of the inlet opening of the mixer.<br>
A particularly preferred version of the device according to the invention provides that<br>
the mixing chamber of the mixer is arranged in a pressurized container and that, inside<br>
the pressurized container but outside the mixing chamber, a closable air feeder is<br>
provided. The pressurized container is advantageously connected via appropriate<br>
seals to the mixing chamber arranged in the pressurized container. These seals<br>
necessarily allow the passage of air, but are intended to hold the components of the<br>
mixture in the mixing chamber as firmly as possible. It is not desirable for mixture to<br>
escape from the mixing chamber into the pressurized container because contamination<br>
of the seals and movable drive components and bearings can occur there. If the<br>
mixing chamber is then rapidly loaded with the substance to be filled without vacuum,<br>
the pressure in the mixing chamber will rise very rapidly. The seals generally used<br>
between the mixing chamber and the pressurized container are, however, not capable<br>
of sustaining their sealing function under such an abrupt rise in pressure. It can<br>
therefore occur that material from the mixing chamber, which then has a higher<br>
pressure than the pressurized chamber, enters the pressurized chamber. As a result of<br>
the closable air feeder arranged according to the invention inside the pressurized<br>
container but outside the mixing chamber, the pressure in the pressurized container<br>
outside the mixing chamber can be increased by the air feeder during the charging<br>
process, so that the pressure in the pressurized container is higher than pressure in the<br>
mixing chamber. In this way, any transfer of material from the mixing chamber into<br>
the pressurized chamber is prevented.<br>
Particularly preferred is a version in which a control unit is provided which opens the<br>
air feeder when the mixture components are supplied and closes the air feeder when<br>
the vacuum container is closed in a vacuum-tight manner. This control unit is<br>
preferably automated, so that, depending on the stage of the method, it is possible to<br>
evacuate the pressurized container and also to allow a build-up of pressure in the<br>
pressurized container, in order to counteract any abrupt rise in pressure in the mixing<br>
chamber as a result of the feeding of mixture components. It is self-evident that the air<br>
feeder described can be used outside the mixing chamber but inside the vacuum<br>
chamber even with known mixers. Even if the known mixers do not use the pressure<br>
difference between the pressurized chamber and the surroundings as a driving force,<br>
and consequently, the abrupt rise in pressure resulting from the charging process is<br>
significantly smaller, a transfer of material from the mixing chamber into the<br>
pressurized chamber will be prevented even with known mixing containers.<br>
A further particularly preferred version of the present invention provides that a feeder<br>
device for water is arranged in such a manner that the water is supplied through or<br>
along a preferably eccentrically arranged mixing tool with mixing paddles and fed<br>
into the mixture essentially in the region of the ends of the mixing paddles. Also in<br>
this case, according to the invention, the pressure difference between the mixing<br>
chamber and the outside environment is exploited. If water is to be fed into the<br>
mixture, a valve merely has to be opened. As a result of the vacuum pressure<br>
prevailing in the mixing chamber, the water is sucked through the feeder device<br>
directly into the mixture. The arrangement of the feeder device along a mixing tool<br>
has the advantage that the water can be fed directly into the mixture at different<br>
positions. In this context, the fluid outlet openings in the water feeder device are<br>
preferably arranged at different depths below the level of the mixture. Adequate<br>
mixing can therefore be achieved extremely quickly.<br>
Particularly preferably, the feeder device for water has a dosage weighing device, the<br>
dosage weighing device and mixer being connected by a preferably at least partially<br>
resilient pipe, which can be closed by a valve, the valve being preferably arranged on<br>
the cover of the mixer.<br>
The so-called quality-determining mixture components are preferably fed with the<br>
assistance of a feeder lance, if possible below the level of the mixture. In this context,<br>
the outlet opening of the feeder lance is, if possible, oriented tangentially to the<br>
direction of flow of the mixture and preferably points in the direction of flow. This<br>
guarantees that, as a result of the flow of mixture emphasized by the rotation of the<br>
mixture, the quality-determining mixture components, which are sucked into the<br>
mixing chamber as a result of the vacuum pressure prevailing in the mixing chamber,<br>
are drawn along with the mixture in the direction of flow and are rapidly and<br>
effectively mixed with the latter.<br>
Further advantages, features and possible applications of the present invention are<br>
explained with reference to the following description of preferred versions and the<br>
accompanying figures.<br>
There are shown in:<br>
Figure la) and lb) a lateral view of the arrangement of a feeder device and a<br>
feeder opening of the mixer in an opened and in a closed<br>
position,<br>
Figure 2 a lateral view of a vacuum mixer with a partial sectional view,<br>
Figure 3 a detailed view of Figure 2,<br>
Figure 4a) and 4b) a schematic representation of the connection between a fluid<br>
dosage weighing device and mixing container,<br>
Figure 5a) and 5b) a lateral view and a top view of the feeder elements for fluids<br>
in the mixing chamber,<br>
Figure 6 a schematic representation of the feeder for the quality-<br>
determining components and<br>
Figure 7 a lateral view of the arrangement of an alternative feeder<br>
device and a feeder opening of the mixer.<br>
Figures la) and lb) show the outlet region of a solids weighing device 10 and the inlet<br>
region of the mixer 1. The solids weighing device 10 is used for determining the<br>
quantity of recycled sand to be supplied or optionally also of other mixture<br>
components. In Figure la), both the mixer 1 and the solids weighing device 10 are<br>
closed, while Figure lb) shows the conveyance position between the mixer 1 and the<br>
solids weighing device 10.<br>
An inlet connecting piece 2 is arranged at the upper side of the mixer 1. This inlet<br>
connecting piece 2 is sealed in a vacuum-tight manner through the container cover 3<br>
with the assistance of the lever arm 5, which is driven, for example, by a hydraulic<br>
cylinder. It can be seen that the container cover 3 provides one lateral cheek 4 at both<br>
of its lateral outer edges.<br>
The solids weighing device 10 also has an outlet flap 11, which provides lateral<br>
cheeks 11' at both of its lateral outer edges. This flap can be opened or closed via the<br>
lever 12.<br>
Moreover, this version has a conveyor chute 13. The conveyor chute 13 also has<br>
lateral cheeks 13 at both of its lateral outer edges. The conveyor chute 13 can be<br>
moved with the assistance of the parallel guide 14 and the lifting drive 15 into the<br>
intermediate space between the solids weighing device 10 and the mixer 1. As a result<br>
of the lateral cheeks, the outlet flap 11, filling flap 3 and conveyor chute 13 provide<br>
an essentially U-shaped cross-section, the lateral cheeks forming the two arms of the<br>
U-shape.<br>
The conveyor chute 13 is arranged in such a manner that, in the extended position,<br>
when the outlet cover 11 of the solids weighing device 10 is open, together with the<br>
outlet flap 11 and the lateral cheeks 11', 14', it forms a channel with an essentially<br>
rectangular cross-section.<br>
This channel is further extended by the open filling cover 8 with its lateral cheeks 4,<br>
so that, in the conveying position, the situation shown in Figure lb) is produced. In<br>
this position, the material is guided from the solids weighing device 10 directly into<br>
the mixer 1. The conveyor chutes in this arrangement form a kind of channel, so that<br>
the edges of the opening are covered and cannot come into contact with the material<br>
to be filled.<br>
The entire range of movement of the flaps 3, 11 and of the conveyor chute 13 is<br>
surrounded by a housing 6 and/or 6'. In the version shown, the housing is designed in<br>
two parts; and the two housing parts 6, 6' are connected to one another via a flexible<br>
preferably sealing connection 7.<br>
The charging process is as follows. First, the two covers 3, 11 of the mixer 1 and the<br>
solids weighing device 10 are closed. If the mixer is to be charged with materials<br>
which are located in the solids weighing device1O, the cover 3 of the mixer 1 is first<br>
opened. Next, the conveyor chute 13 is moved into the region between the solids<br>
weighing device 10 and the mixer 1. This has not hitherto been possible because, in<br>
the extended state, the conveyor chute 13 is located within the rotational range of the<br>
filling cover 3 of the mixer 1. If the outlet flap 11 of the solids weighing device 10 is<br>
then opened, the materials from the solids weighing device will be filled directly and<br>
rapidly into the mixing chamber of the mixer 1 via the channel formed by the outlet<br>
flap 11, inlet cover 3 and conveyor chute 13. In this manner, the mould sand from the<br>
solids weighing device 10 is conveyed into the mixer 1 without significant material<br>
loss and without substantial emissions of dust, through a large cross-section and in a<br>
short time.<br>
As shown in the diagrams, additionally arranged in the housing 6, 6' are air nozzles 8,<br>
9 which direct an air-flow onto the seal of the inlet cover 3 and the drive mechanism<br>
of the inlet cover 3, so that, after each filling process, those places are fanned on<br>
which a deposit of sand may have a negative effect, in order to guarantee a secure and<br>
sealed closure of the inlet cover 3.<br>
The inlet cover 3 of the mixer 1 according to the invention does not have any<br>
particularly complicated design for the sealing elements. Rather, it is simply pressed<br>
by the vacuum pressure prevailing in the mixer 1 against the opening of the mixer 1,<br>
so that the opening or the cover 3 merely needs to be surrounded by a searing ring.<br>
However, this version of the inlet cover 3 necessarily requires a certain distance<br>
between the solids weighing device 10 and the mixer 1, because the cover 3 requires<br>
sufficient clearance for rotation. As described, this distance is bridged by the material<br>
guiding channel, which is formed from the flaps 3, 11 and the conveyor chute 15 and<br>
lateral cheeks 4, 11', 13'. According to the invention, the charging time for a mixer of<br>
this kind is reduced from approximately 30-40 seconds, which is entirely standard for<br>
mixers available on the market, to less than 10 seconds.<br>
The mixing chamber 16 of a vacuum mixer 1 is normally arranged in a vacuum<br>
chamber 17. The basic structure is shown in Figure 2 with further detail shown in<br>
Figure 3. The vacuum chamber 17 is sealed via flexible seals 18 from the mixing<br>
chamber 16. In this context, the seal 18 is used only to prevent the entry of mixture<br>
material from the mixing chamber 16 into the vacuum chamber 17. The drive unit for<br>
the mixer is generally arranged in the vacuum chamber 17 but outside the mixing<br>
chamber 16. For this reason, the reliable function of the seal 18 is extremely<br>
important, as otherwise the intermediate space 17 would have to be cleaned<br>
frequently, as otherwise the drive unit could be destroyed as a result of solid materials<br>
of the mixture. The charging phase, in particular, is a very critical moment for the seal<br>
18. Even with the conventional mixers, an abrupt rise in pressure occurs as a result of<br>
the filling process, so that repeated functional failures of the seal 18 occur. This<br>
problem is further intensified by the charging process as described with reference to<br>
Figures la) and 1b). According to the invention, the mixing container is under<br>
vacuum at the beginning of the charging process, so that the abrupt rise in pressure in<br>
the mixing container is even more pronounced during charging. In order to prevent<br>
the entry of dust into the intermediate space 17, a sliding ring seal may, for example,<br>
be used. However, since this causes very high costs, a version according to the<br>
invention provides a closable air feeder 19. This air feeder, which in Figures 2 and 3<br>
is designed as a pressure fan, is capable of increasing the pressure in the intermediate<br>
space 17 at the beginning of the charging process. In this context, the rise in pressure<br>
in the intermediate chamber 17 should approximately correspond to or even exceed<br>
the abrupt rise in pressure in the mixing chamber 16.<br>
Figure 3 shows structural details of the seal 18. Approximately at the start of the<br>
charging process, the valve 21 is opened, so that the pressure fan 19 introduces air<br>
into the intermediate space 17 between the pressurized chamber wall 17' and the<br>
mixing chamber wall 16'. The air introduced flows in the direction of the arrow<br>
through the gap seals 18, 22 into the mixing chamber 16. As a result of this measure,<br>
the emission of dust or material from the mixing chamber 16 into the intermediate<br>
space 17 is effectively prevented.<br>
It is evident that the air feeder does not necessarily require a pressure fan 19 or a<br>
similar device; for some cases of application, it may be adequate if only a closable<br>
opening is provided as the air feeder, which is simply opened at the beginning of the<br>
charging process, so that the pressure in the vacuum chamber and/or the intermediate<br>
space 17 and the mixing chamber 16 rises in an approximately synchronized manner.<br>
At the start of the preparation of the mould sand under vacuum, the air feeder must be<br>
switched off again or closed.<br>
Figures 4a) and 4b) show the charging of the mixer with the necessary quantity of<br>
mixing water. Between 0.5 and 4% mixing water are normally added to the mixture.<br>
The exact quantity of water to be added is determined by measuring the residual<br>
moisture of the recycled sand before placing in the mixer or even in the mixer. The<br>
residual moisture of the recycled sand and therefore also the quantity of mixing water<br>
to be added depends on the preliminary thermal loading of the recycled sand.<br>
Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the vacuum-cooling process also consumes a<br>
certain quantity of water because, as described above, it is based upon the removal of<br>
evaporation heat, so that an additional quantity of water must be added, which<br>
evaporates during the vacuum phase.<br>
Figure 4a) shows a conventional arrangement. A weighing container 25 is shown<br>
which is suspended by means of a carrier structure 24 on a weighing cell 23. The<br>
weighing cell 23 measures the weight of the weighing container 25 including the<br>
carrier structure and content of water. When the valve 26 is opened, the water leaves<br>
the weighing container 25 via an outlet pipe 27 and flows into an inlet pipe 30. The<br>
inlet pipe 30 is connected rigidly to the pressurized container of the mixer. The inlet<br>
pipe 30 and outlet pipe 27 are expediently surrounded by a pressure-resistant but<br>
flexible sleeve 29. To allow the water to be added very quickly, water is drawn from<br>
the weighing container 25 and the quantity is determined via the weight loss, which is<br>
detected by the weighing cell 23.<br>
The pressure difference between the mixing chamber and the surroundings or, in this<br>
case, the weighing container 25 can also be used advantageously in the context of the<br>
water supply, in order to significantly accelerate the charging process. This is possible<br>
in a similar manner to the charging of mould sand described with reference to Figures<br>
1 and 2, for example, if the mixing water is supplied while the mixing container is<br>
under vacuum. However, with the arrangement shown in Figure 4a), this is only<br>
possible subject to other disadvantages.<br>
In the case of the arrangement shown in Figure 4a, the vacuum pressure in the mixing<br>
container exerts a drawing force on the valve 26 via the inlet pipe 30 with diameter D.<br>
This drawing force depends on the momentary pressure in the mixing container and<br>
has a disadvantageous effect on the measuring accuracy of the weighing cell 23. Even<br>
the filling of the weighing container 25 with water, during a process phase, in which<br>
no water is supplied to the mixing chamber, cannot be metered accurately, because the<br>
changing pressure in the mixing chamber is also always exerted on the weighing the<br>
cell 23.<br>
The particular version shown in Figure 4b) provides that the valve 26 is not arranged<br>
in the outlet pipe 26 but in and/or on the inlet pipe 30. In this case, the sleeve 29 is<br>
necessarily above the valve 26 and not, as in the case of conventional plants, below<br>
the valve 26. Moreover, this arrangement has the advantage that the falsifying<br>
influence of the mixing chamber pressure on the weighing cell 23, on the one hand,<br>
occurs only while the valve is open, and on the other hand, the pressure acts on the<br>
weighing cell 23 only via the significantly smaller cross-section d' of the outlet pipe.<br>
As a result of this arrangement, the weighing container 25 can reliably be filled with<br>
the desired quantity when the valve 26 is closed. The weighing error while the valve<br>
is open can easily be corrected by means of a tare correction.<br>
For particularly accurate dosages, the tare correction can be carried out with the<br>
assistance of the dosage computer 31 and the dosage meter 33. The dosage meter 33<br>
registers the current pressure in the mixing chamber and passes this value to the<br>
dosage computer 31. The dosage computer 31 calculates the drawing force exerted by<br>
the mixing chamber on the weighing cell 23 and corrects the weighing result, so that<br>
the mixing water can be metered very accurately.<br>
The duration of filling can be considerably reduced by exploiting the pressure<br>
difference between the mixing chamber and the ambient pressure. For example, the<br>
cross-section d' of the outlet pipe can be reduced, so that the falsifying influence of<br>
the drawing force can be further reduced. As a result, the rate of filling is necessarily<br>
increased, but this is more than compensated by the vacuum-filling process.<br>
Introducing the mixing water under vacuum has the additional advantage that the<br>
water is immediately finely distributed and spreads in a nebulous manner in the<br>
mixing chamber.<br>
The thorough mixing of the mixing water with the mixture can be further improved<br>
and above all accelerated if the mixing water is supplied via a device, as shown in<br>
Figures 5a) and 5b). A mixing shaft 34 with mixing tools 35 is provided in the mixer<br>
1. The mixing shaft 34 is mounted outside the container in a bearing 32. Above the<br>
bearing, a rotary connection 31 is connected to the inlet pipe 30. The water flowing<br>
from the dosage device, preferably from the water weighing device described with<br>
reference to Figure 4b), in the direction of the arrow, is guided via the rotary<br>
connection 31 into the longitudinal bore hole 33 of the mixing shaft 34. The<br>
longitudinal borehole 33 is connected at different heights by pipes or hoses 36 to<br>
outlet nozzles 37. Subject to the vacuum prevailing in the mixing container, the water<br>
is sucked through the supply and distribution system described directly into the<br>
mixture, without pumping or other conveying devices being necessary. The method<br>
according to the invention even allows the processing of recycled condensation water<br>
from a thermal exchange unit of the vacuum cooling process. Condensation water is<br>
generally contaminated with fine particles, so that there can be no question of<br>
charging this water when using pumps or conventional nozzles, because a pump will<br>
wear very rapidly as a result of the fine particles and the nozzles can frequently<br>
become clogged. According to the present invention, however, this water can be re-<br>
used directly without prior costly cleaning processes.<br>
An alternative version of the present invention is shown in Figure 6. In this case,<br>
powdered additives are successfully utilized by exploiting the pressure difference<br>
(principle of suction conveyance) between the mixing container and the atmosphere.<br>
These additives, often also referred to as quality-determining mixture components, are<br>
normally blown into the mixer under pressure. However, for this purpose, appropriate<br>
pressure stores must be provided for the pumping air. In addition to the undesirable<br>
additional space requirement, the consumption of expensive compressed air is not to<br>
be ignored. Moreover, the vacuum cooling process cannot be implemented while the<br>
additives are being supplied, because the supply of additives under pressure is also<br>
necessarily associated with an increase in pressure in the mixing container.<br>
Furthermore, the charge of compressed air in the mixing chamber can have<br>
disadvantageous consequences, In addition to restricting the sealing function of the<br>
seal 8, as described in the context of Figure 2 and 3, the charge of air can also delay<br>
the uniform thorough mixing of the mixture with the mixing water and the additives.<br>
According to the invention, the disadvantages described can be overcome by<br>
supplying the powdered additives with the assistance of a preferably stationary mixing<br>
tool 39 or its carrier arm 41. The stationary mixing tool 39 is used primarily for<br>
guiding the material. With reference to the arrangement shown in Figure 6, the<br>
mixing tool 39 assumes the additional function of cleaning the container wall of mixer<br>
1. The mixer 1 or the mixing chamber rotates in an anticlockwise direction as shown<br>
in Figure 6 from above. The mixing tool "scrapes" along the container wall thereby<br>
cleaning any unmixed mixture components from it. The mixing tool guides the<br>
mixture from the edge of the container to the middle of the container 1. The mixing<br>
tool 39 is attached by means of a carrying arm 41. The carrying arm 41 is designed to<br>
be hollow, so that the powdered additives, the quantity of which has been determined<br>
with the assistance of the dosage weighing device 43, can be supplied via the feeder<br>
42 into the hollow cavity 40 of the carrier arm. The additives are sucked into the<br>
mixing chamber as a result of the pressure difference between the mixing container<br>
and the surroundings. The hollow cavity 40 is connected to a feeder nozzle 45, of<br>
which the outlet opening is arranged in such a manner that the additives sucked in are<br>
guided inwards in as radial a manner as possible. The version shown in Figure 6<br>
exploits the suction action, which is formed in connection with the mixing tool 39, in<br>
order to draw the additives inwards. For this purpose, the mixing tool 39 provides yet<br>
another extended region 39' in the vicinity of the base, which is arranged in the<br>
direction of flow of the mixture essentially directly in front of the outlet opening of<br>
the feeder nozzle 45.<br>
As a result of this sophisticated arrangement and the exploitation according to the<br>
invention of the pressure difference, additives can be supplied simply and<br>
economically. Moreover, mixing is extremely effective and, above all, rapid.<br>
The hollow tool designed for supplying additives can also advantageously be used for<br>
ventilation, that is, for pressure equalization of the mixing container, when the<br>
vacuum cooling process is completed. For this purpose, air is simply sucked in<br>
through the feeder 44 into the mixing container. Feeding the air directly into the<br>
mixture, that is, below the level of the mixture, provides the important advantage that<br>
the mixture is not temporarily compressed by the resulting pressure wave, which is<br>
not the case with the conventional mixers, and the air can therefore be mixed into the<br>
mixture.<br>
Figure 7 shows an alternative version of the charging opening of the mixer 1. In this<br>
version, the mixer 1 does not have a cover. Only a pressure-resistant, rigid conveying<br>
funnel 46, which surrounds the inlet opening, is provided. Above the conveying<br>
funnel, a similarly pressure-resistant but movable housing 47 is provided which is<br>
connected via a pressure-resistant, flexible connection 48 to the conveying funnel 46.<br>
The weighing container 49 is used for the dosage of the mixture to be added. The<br>
quantity to be filled can be deduced from the weight of the weighing container 49,<br>
which is determined via the force transducer 51. At its lower end, the weighing<br>
container 49 provides a pressure-tight closure cap 11, which can be opened and closed<br>
via an activation lever 52. Additionally, closure mountings 51 are provided, which<br>
serve to hold the closure cap onto the weighing container 49 in a vacuum-tight<br>
manner.<br>
This version allows the addition of the mixture under vacuum. The filling procedure<br>
is as follows. Initially, the closure cap 11 of the weighing container 49 is closed. The<br>
mixing container 1 is evacuated so that vacuum pressure prevails even inside the<br>
conveyor funnel 46 and the pressure-resistant housing 47. The mixture is then filled<br>
into the weighing container 49, and the quantity to be filled is determined via the<br>
pressure transducer 50. When measuring the quantity to be filled, it should be taken<br>
into account that the pressure difference between the housing 47 and the interior of<br>
the weighing container 49 falsifies the weighing via the force transducer 50. This<br>
must be taken into account when calculating the net weight. The weighing container<br>
49 and the housing 47 rigidly connected to the weighing container can readily be<br>
displaced in a vertical direction depending on the filling weight and the pressure<br>
difference. This vertical movement is allowed by the flexible connection 48, which is<br>
clearly shown in Figure 7 on the left in the detailed enlargement.<br>
In the next stage, the closure mountings 51, which enclose the closure cap in the<br>
manner of a clamp, are rotated outwards around the axis 53, as shown in Figure 7 in<br>
the right-hand detailed view. The closure cap is thus unlocked and can then be opened<br>
with the assistance of the activation lever 52. In combination with the large charging<br>
opening, the pressure difference between the solids weighing device and the mixing<br>
container ensures rapid charging. Furthermore, a cover which includes the associated,<br>
necessary drive units can be dispensed with in the case of this version. Moreover, this<br>
version requires a lower structural height, because the rotational range for the mixing<br>
chamber cover is not necessary, and the closure cap of the solids weighing device can<br>
be designed in such a manner that it is immersed in the conveyor funnel or even in the<br>
mixing container opening during opening.<br>
It is self-evident that all of the versions described can also be realized with smaller<br>
mixing container openings, although this necessarily means that the charging rate will<br>
be somewhat lower. Depending on the individual case of application, however, one of<br>
the versions described may be advantageous in combination with a smaller charging<br>
opening.<br>
