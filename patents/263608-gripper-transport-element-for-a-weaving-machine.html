Description<br>
Gripper transport element for a weaving machine<br>
The invention relates to a gripper transport element for a weaving machine,<br>
which has vertical guide surfaces for guidance in the vertical direction and<br>
horizontal guide surfaces for guidance in the horizontal direction.<br>
Gripper transport elements of the type mentioned above are guided within<br>
the weaving shed by means of hook-shaped guide elements, which are<br>
attached to the slay of the weaving machine and introduced into the weav-<br>
ing shed through the lower warp sheet for a weft insertion, in order to<br>
guide the gripper transport element during the weft insertion. After weft<br>
insertion when beating up the weft thread, the guide elements are again<br>
moved out of the weaving shed.<br>
With a known gripper transport element of the type mentioned above (EP<br>
0275479 B1) the gripper transport element having the form of a gripper<br>
band is provided with a longitudinal groove cut on its lower side. The upper<br>
side and groove root of the longitudinal groove form vertical guide surfaces<br>
on which they are movable in the weaving shed to guide the gripper band<br>
against movement in the vertical direction. The guide elements which<br>
have, for technical reasons, an open hook-shape form towards the reed<br>
engage with a guide in the undercut longitudinal groove of the gripper<br>
transport element. The horizontal guide surfaces comprise the side surface<br>
of the gripper band facing away from the reed, on which the gripper band is<br>
prevented from movement away from the reed in the horizontal direction.<br>
The horizontal guide surface that prevents the gripper-band movement in<br>
the direction towards the reed is formed by a sidewall of the longitudinal<br>
groove. This surface is inevitably relatively small so that substantial abra-<br>
sion occurs at this point, which allows the gripper band to become use-<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-2-<br>
less.<br>
It is also known (WO 94/10364) to provided C-shape guide elements that<br>
lap the upper and lower of the gripper band on the side facing the reed<br>
and as such guide the side surface facing away from the reed and the up-<br>
per and lower area of the side surface facing the reed in the horizontal di-<br>
rection. The gripper band is provided with a lateral projection running in<br>
the longitudinal direction, which is guided between the two projections op-<br>
posite one another of the C-shaped guide elements in the vertical direc-<br>
tion. The upper side and lower side of the gripper band run at a distance<br>
from the opposite surfaces of the guide elements, i.e. they do not serve as<br>
vertical guide surfaces. Due to the relatively small size of the guide sur-<br>
faces, severe abrasion occurs in a relatively short time. Moreover, with<br>
this "floating" guide of the gripper band, danger exists that the gripper<br>
band is prone to kinking at high weaving speeds.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a gripper transport element of the<br>
type mentioned at the beginning, which offers relatively large guide sur-<br>
faces for better guidance and is therefore not susceptible to significant<br>
abrasion.<br>
This object is achieved in that, at least over a part of the length of the<br>
gripper transport element at least two longitudinal grooves are provided,<br>
which are disposed in the horizontal direction at a distance from one an-<br>
other and form horizontal guide surfaces.<br>
By means of the longitudinal grooves, the size of the horizontal guide sur-<br>
faces that prevent movement of the gripper transport element in the direc-<br>
tion towards the reed can be made relatively large so that abrasion can be<br>
slowed down. By means of the longitudinal grooves, the guide surfaces<br>
and in particular the horizontal guide surfaces can be enlarged in relation<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	- 3 -<br>
to the cross-section of the gripper transport element, so that it is possible<br>
to use a gripper transport element that has a smaller cross-area in rela-<br>
tionship to the size of the guide surfaces. It is therefore possible to re-<br>
duce the size of the gripper transport element in relation to their normal<br>
sizes, without however reducing the guide surfaces and in particular, the<br>
horizontal guide surfaces. A gripper transport element with a small cross-<br>
area has a correspondingly small mass and is therefore suitable for high<br>
weaving speeds.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a guiding part adjoining or replacing<br>
the gripper band or the gripper rod is provided on a part of the length,<br>
which has the two longitudinal grooves. The gripper band or the gripper<br>
rod can in this case retain the initial shape with a longitudinal groove,<br>
whereas the additional horizontal guide surfaces are provided within the<br>
guiding part.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, the height of<br>
the sidewalls of the longitudinal grooves towards each side at least ap-<br>
proximately corresponds to the thickness of the gripper band or the grip-<br>
per rod or of the guiding part.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, the gripper<br>
band or the gripper rod, or the guiding part is enlarged on the one side<br>
adjoining a longitudinal groove.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, the upper side<br>
and the lower side serve as vertical guide surfaces and both side surfaces<br>
of the gripper band or the gripper rod serve as horizontal guide surfaces<br>
for C-shaped guide elements. In this manner, all outer surfaces can be<br>
used as guide surfaces.<br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-4-<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, preferably two<br>
equally wide and deep longitudinal grooves are provided in the upper side<br>
and / or lower side. In a further embodiment, it is provided that, preferably<br>
two opposite, equally wide and equally deep longitudinal grooves are<br>
provided in the upper side and in the lower side. In a further embodiment,<br>
longitudinal grooves are provided displaced in the transverse direction to<br>
one another in the upper side and in the lower side. With all these em-<br>
bodiments, it is achieved that the horizontal guide surfaces can be pro-<br>
vided with a sufficiently large size to prevent movement in the direction<br>
towards a reed in order to reduce abrasion.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, a row of holes<br>
is provided with holes running from the upper side to the lower side, which<br>
are at least partly located in a area that is free from longitudinal grooves.<br>
This is an advantage in particular in comparison to the embodiment ac-<br>
cording to EP 0275479 B1, in which the row of holes is located in the<br>
longitudinal grooves area, i.e., in the area where the cross-section is re-<br>
duced by the longitudinal grooves.<br>

description of the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and in the de-<br>

In the description of the invention, guiding surfaces of a gripper transport<br>
element, i.e., a gripper band or a gripper rod or a guiding part are de-<br>
signed with vertical guide surfaces that guide the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment against deviations from its motion line in the vertical direction. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the guiding surfaces of the gripper transport element that<br>
guide the gripper transport element against deviation from its motion line<br>
in the horizontal direction are designed as horizontal guide surfaces.<br>
Typically, the vertical guide surfaces are essentially horizontally aligned<br>
and the horizontal guide surfaces are essentially vertically aligned. The<br>
vertical guide surfaces and the horizontal guide surfaces run usefully<br>
perpendicular to one another. They must however, neither be actually<br>
horizontally nor vertically aligned. In fact, they can more or less run in-<br>
clined to the horizontal or vertical direction.<br>
The gripper transport element 10 shown in Fig. 1 to 3 has the form of a<br>
gripper rod or a gripper band. The essential difference between a gripper<br>
rod and a gripper band is that the gripper rod is guided linearly outside<br>
the weaving machine. A gripper band in contrast is deflected by the drive<br>
wheel outside the weaving machine, so that little space is needed later-<br>
ally besides the weaving machine. A gripper rod can feature a higher<br>
flexural rigidity than a gripper band.<br>
The gripper transport element 10 typically comprises laminated plastic<br>
with intermediate layers of reinforced fibers, in particular carbon fiber or<br>
also polyaramide fibers (Kevlar fibers). The gripper transport element 10<br>
is provided with a gripper on its end which enters into the shed. Within a<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	- 7 -<br>
shed the gripper transport element 10 is guided by means of guide ele-<br>
ments 11 that are attached to a slay, on which also a reed is fixed. With<br>
the motion of the slay, the guide elements 11 are introduced into a weav-<br>
ing shed between the warp-threads through the lower warp sheet, so that<br>
they can lead to the gripper transport element 10 within the weaving<br>
shed.<br>
The upper side 12 and the lower side 13 of the gripper transport element<br>
10 form vertical guide surfaces that guide the gripper transport element<br>
10 in the vertical direction, i.e., prevent movement from the predeter-<br>
mined motion line in the vertical direction. The guide elements 11 feature<br>
a C-shape form and are open on the side facing the reed (not shown).<br>
They guide the gripper transport element 10 on the two side surfaces 14<br>
and 15 that form the horizontal guide surfaces, so that the gripper trans-<br>
port element 10 is prevented from movement in the horizontal direction.<br>
On the closed side of the guide elements 11, the entire height of the side<br>
surface 14 can be utilized as a horizontal guide surface.<br>
On the opposite open side, however, only a part of the side surface 15 is<br>
usable as a horizontal guide surface.<br>
To enlarge the horizontal guide surfaces, a longitudinal groove 16 is<br>
provided in the lower side 13 of the gripper transport element 10, of which<br>
the side surfaces enlarge the horizontal guide surfaces. Thereby, above<br>
all, enlargement of the horizontal guide surfaces is advantageous, in that<br>
it prevents movement towards the reed, i.e., the right side surface in Fig.<br>
1 and 2 of the longitudinal groove 16. In the longitudinal groove 16, a pro-<br>
jection 17 of the guide surfaces engage, which, together with the side sur-<br>
faces of the longitudinal groove 16, support the horizontal guide.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2 and 3, the gripper transport element 10 is pro-<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	- 8 -<br>
vided over a part A of its length, which is for instance 500 mm long, with<br>
an enlargement 18 that runs outside the guide elements 11. The enlarge-<br>
ment 18 has approximately the same height as that of the part of the grip-<br>
per transport element 10 guided within the guide elements 11, i.e., ap-<br>
proximately the same height as the side surfaces 14, 15. A gripper can be<br>
fixed on this enlargement 18. For example, this can occur in the manner<br>
disclosed in WO 94/10364. Between the part of the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment 10 located within the guide elements 11 and the enlargement, there<br>
are two further longitudinal grooves 19, 20, in which the portions, of the C-<br>
shaped guide elements 11 opposite one another, engage. The gripper<br>
transport element 10 therefore has two longitudinal grooves 16, 20 that<br>
are disposed in the transverse direction to one another at a distance in the<br>
area A, in which the enlargement 18 is provided inside the lower side 13.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 and 5, the gripper transport element 10' must not con-<br>
sist of a single part over the entire length. The gripper transport element<br>
10' shown in Fig. 4 consists of a framework 21 corresponding to the inte-<br>
rior contour of the guide elements 11 of a gripper rod or of a gripper band<br>
and a guiding part 22 which forms the enlargement extending over area A<br>
and forms the second longitudinal groove 20'. Likewise, it forms the longi-<br>
tudinal groove 19' and in the elongation of the longitudinal groove 16, the<br>
longitudinal groove 16'.<br>
The gripper transport element 60 according to Fig. 8 is suitable in particular<br>
as a gripper band. It has an essentially flat rectangular cross-section, which<br>
is relatively flexible to bending about a horizontal axis but relatively rigid to<br>
bending about a vertical axis. The upper side 61 and the lower side 62 form<br>
vertical guide surfaces, of which the guides are assigned guide surfaces 63<br>
that prevent movement of the gripper transport element 60 in the vertical<br>
direction. In the lower side 62 of the gripper transport element 60 two longi-<br>
tudinal grooves 64, 65 are integrated, which feature the same width and the<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-9-<br>
same depth in the exemplary embodiment and feature the same distance<br>
from the longitudinal middle of the gripper transport element 60. The projec-<br>
tions 66, 67 of the guide surfaces 63 engage in the longitudinal grooves 64,<br>
65. The side surface 68 facing away from the open sides of guide elements<br>
63 of the gripper transport element 60 facing a reed (not shown) forms one<br>
horizontal guide surface that prevents horizontal movement of the gripper<br>
transport element 60 from the open side, i.e. away from the reed (not<br>
shown). The side surfaces of the longitudinal grooves 64, 65 facing the<br>
open side of the guide surfaces 63 form horizontal guide surfaces, which<br>
prevent horizontal movement of the gripper transport element 60 in the di-<br>
rection towards the open side, i.e., towards the reed (not shown). The depth<br>
of the longitudinal grooves 64, 65 is selected such that the added height of<br>
the two side surfaces of the longitudinal grooves 64, 65 facing the open<br>
side at least approximately corresponds to the height of the side surface 68.<br>
The height of the entire guide surface, which prevents movement of the grip-<br>
per transport element 60 in the direction towards the reed (not shown), cor-<br>
respond therefore at least to approximately the thickness of the gripper<br>
transport element 60.<br>
The gripper transport element 70 according to Fig. 9 is likewise particularly<br>
suitable as a gripper band, since it has a smaller height than width. It differs<br>
from the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 8 in that longitudinal<br>
grooves 76, 77 are provided in the upper side 71 additionally to the longitu-<br>
dinal grooves 74, 75 in the lower side 72. The guide elements 73 are de-<br>
signed such that they engage into all four longitudinal grooves 74, 75, 76,<br>
77 and work together with horizontal guide surfaces that are formed by<br>
the longitudinal-groove sidewalls. The gripper transport element 70 is pro-<br>
vided in its longitudinal middle with holes 78 running from the upper side<br>
71 to the lower side 72, which are disposed in a row of holes. In these<br>
holes 78, teeth of a drive gear wheel engage in a known manner. The<br>
holes 78 of the row of holes are located in a area of the gripper transport<br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-10-<br>
element 70,  of which the cross-area  is  not weakened  by longitudinal<br>
grooves.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 10 and 11 essentially cor-<br>
responds to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3. In addi-<br>
tion, in the upper side 12 of the gripper transport element 80, a further<br>
longitudinal groove 82 is integrated, which is likewise involved at the side<br>
guide, i.e. forms horizontal guide surfaces for projections 84 of the guide<br>
elements 83. With the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 10 and 11<br>
an enlargement 88 likewise running outside of the guide elements 83 is<br>
provided, which extends over a part of the length of the gripper transport<br>
element 80, for example about 500 mm. The enlargement 88 adjoins via<br>
an upper longitudinal groove 87 and a lower longitudinal groove 89 the<br>
area guided within the guide element 83.<br>
In Fig. 12 an exemplary embodiment is shown, which in principle corre-<br>
sponds to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 8. The gripper<br>
transport element 100 is provided on its lower side with two longitudinal<br>
grooves 101, 102, in which shoulders 105, 107 of guide elements 103<br>
engage. In contrast to the exemplary embodiment according to Fig. 8, the<br>
longitudinal grooves 101, 102 are not symmetrical to the longitudinal<br>
middle plane and therefore do not have the same width. They as such do<br>
not have the same depth. The longitudinal groove 102 is formed deeper<br>
than the longitudinal groove 101. Also, in this case one preferably strives<br>
for the entire height of the horizontal guide surfaces of the gripper trans-<br>
port element 100, which prevent movement towards the open side of the<br>
guide elements 103, at least approximately corresponds to the entire<br>
thickness of the gripper transport element 100.<br>
With the exemplary embodiment according to Fig.  13, a longitudinal<br>
groove 112 is provided in the gripper transport element 111 somewhat<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-11-<br>
outside the middle of the lower side, in which projections of thread<br>
guide elements 113 engage. In the upper side of the gripper transport<br>
element 111, towards the closed side of the thread guide elements 113,<br>
offset from the longitudinal groove 112 from top, a longitudinal groove<br>
114 is integrated. In the longitudinal groove 114 a corresponding shoul-<br>
der 115 of the thread guide elements 113 engages, so that also the<br>
walls of the longitudinal groove 114 serve as horizontal guide surfaces.<br>
Since the longitudinal grooves 112, 114 beginning in the lower side and<br>
in the upper side of the gripper transport element 111 are offset in the<br>
transverse or in the horizontal direction in relation to one another, their<br>
depth can project over half of the thickness of the gripper transport ele-<br>
ment 111. In Fig. 14, it is shown that the longitudinal groove 115', which<br>
begins at the upper side of the gripper transport element 111, just like the<br>
longitudinal groove 112, has a depth that is larger than half the thickness<br>
of the gripper transport element 111.<br>
With the embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3 or 4 to 7 it is provided that<br>
the enlargement 18 has the same thickness, which the gripper transport<br>
element 10, 10' has in the area in front of the enlargement 18. As shown<br>
in Fig. 15 and 16, the enlargement 18', 18" can also feature a smaller<br>
thickness or a larger thickness than the preceding gripper transport ele-<br>
ment. In addition, it is possible to use the lower side of the enlargement<br>
18' or 18" as additional guide surface, which supports the vertical guide.<br>
The guide elements 11' are provided with a corresponding shoulder 25,<br>
which is associated to the lower side of the enlargement 18', 18". This<br>
support of the enlargement 18', 18" leads to better absorption of torsional<br>
forces in the area of the enlargement 18', 18".<br>
As already mentioned, the horizontal guide surfaces that guide the grip-<br>
per transport element in the horizontal direction must not be directed in the<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-12-<br>
vertical direction. Likewise, the vertical guide surfaces that guide the<br>
gripper transport element in the vertical direction must not be directed in<br>
the horizontal direction. Furthermore, not all horizontal guide surfaces<br>
must be aligned parallel to one another. With the embodiment according<br>
to Fig. 17 and 18 a gripper transport element 170 is provided, which in<br>
principle corresponds to the embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3 or ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 4 to 7. In deviation from the embodiment according to Fig.<br>
1 to 3 or 4 to 7 it is provided that the gripper transport element 170 in the<br>
upper area, in the left corner of the drawing, which is associated with the<br>
reed (not shown), has an inclined guide surface 171. This inclined guide<br>
surface 171 prevents both the deviation of the gripper transport element<br>
170 from its motion line in the direction towards the open side of the<br>
guide element 173, i.e. towards the reed as well as the deviation in the<br>
vertical direction. Also with the embodiment according to Fig. 17 and 18<br>
the guide element 173 is provided with a shoulder 25 directed towards<br>
the reed, which serves as a support and guide for the enlargement 18 of<br>
the gripper transport element 170.<br>
Similar guide surfaces running inclined to the horizontal and inclined to the<br>
vertical direction can also be provided for all other embodiments, as shown<br>
for example by means of Fig. 19, which shows a modification of the em-<br>
bodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3. The gripper transport element 190 is<br>
provided with an inclined guide surface 191, which is associated with a<br>
correspondingly inclined guide of the guide element 11'.<br>
The gripper transport element 70 according Fig. 9 in the exemplary em-<br>
bodiment according to Fig. 20 is guided with a guide element 73' which dif-<br>
fers from the guide element 73, according to Fig. 9, in that, a vertical guide is<br>
provided only in the groove-root area of the longitudinal grooves 74, 75, 76,<br>
77, and in the portions in between the upper side 71 and the lower side 72. In<br>
the area of the internal parts of the gripper transport element located in the<br><br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-13-<br>
guide elements 73', the guide elements 73' are recessed such that they<br>
maintain a distance from the corresponding area of the upper side 71 and<br>
lower side 72.<br>
As shown in Fig. 22, it is provided in a modified embodiment according to<br>
Fig. 9 or 20 that the guide elements 73" have a shoulder 25 projecting from<br>
the open side directed towards the reed (not shown), with which the lower<br>
side of the part of the gripper transport element 10 located outside the<br>
guide elements 73" is guided.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 21 in principle corresponds to the em-<br>
bodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3. The difference is that in the case of this<br>
embodiment, the gripper transport element 210 has a cross section that is<br>
significantly wider in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction.<br>
Such a flat gripper transport element 210 is suitable in particular as a grip-<br>
per band.<br>
The embodiments shown in Fig. 23 and 24 essentially correspond to the<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 1 to 3. With the embodiment according to Fig.<br>
2, 3 and 4, it is additionally intended that the gripper transport element 230<br>
be provided with longitudinal ribs 231, 232 in the area of its side surfaces.<br>
The longitudinal rib 232 that is located on the open side is guided between<br>
the opposite portions of the C-shape guide elements 233. This longitudinal<br>
rib transforms in area A into the enlargement 18. The guide elements 233<br>
are provided with a recess adapted to the longitudinal rib 231. By means of<br>
the longitudinal ribs 231, 232 the vertical guide surfaces outside of the<br>
section A are enlarged. In addition, in the area of the longitudinal ribs 231,<br>
232, which is somewhat located in the neutral middle plane of the gripper<br>
transport element 230, several layers of the reinforcement fibers that can<br>
feature a larger width are laid in.<br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-14-<br>
With the embodiment according to Fig. 25 to 28, guide elements 63 ac-<br>
cording to the embodiment of Fig. 8 are used. In the area of section A, the<br>
gripper transport element 250 has a cross area according to the gripper<br>
transport element 60 of Fig. 8. The two projections 66 and 67 engage in<br>
the longitudinal grooves that are open towards the lower side. These longi-<br>
tudinal grooves are located between three ribs 251, 252, 253, which pro-<br>
trude downwards from the lower side of the gripper transport element. The<br>
middle rib extends only over section A of the gripper transport element<br>
250. The two outer ribs 251, 253 still run a little further and then transform<br>
into the lower side of the gripper transport element 250. The gripper trans-<br>
port element 250 has a flat, rectangular shape in the adjoining area, as<br>
seen in Fig. 26. A horizontal guide for the gripper transport element 250 is<br>
thus only provided in section A in full scale and in the adjoining section, in<br>
which the two outer longitudinal ribs 251, 253 are present. As seen in Fig.<br>
28, which shows one view of the lower side of the gripper transport element<br>
250, used as a gripper band, no lateral enlargement of the gripper transport<br>
element 250 is intended in section A. A gripper is fastened on the parts of<br>
the gripper transport element protruding from the guide elements 63.<br>
Fig. 29 to 32 show a gripper transport element 290, similar to Fig. 4 to 7,<br>
whereby, nonetheless, the two longitudinal grooves are fully disposed in the<br>
guiding part 22' of the gripper transport element 290. The gripper transport<br>
element 290 has a flat rectangular cross -section, as seen in Fig. 32. In its<br>
front area the height of the band-shaped part 291 is reduced to half and<br>
lies on the upper guiding part 22'. The guiding part 22' in section A forms<br>
an enlargement 18 that protrudes from the guide elements 11, on the open<br>
side and serves for fastening a gripper. From the lower side of the guiding<br>
part, two longitudinal ribs 292, 293 project. The enlargement of the guiding<br>
part 22' has the same height as the longitudinal ribs 292, 293, so that be-<br>
tween the longitudinal ribs 292, 293 on the one hand and the longitudinal<br>
rib 293 with the enlargement on the other hand, two longitudinal grooves are<br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-15-<br>
formed, which engage in the shoulders of the guide elements 11.<br>
The free end of the guiding part 22' is formed in such a manner that when<br>
being introduced into the weaving shed it cannot possibly take warp-<br>
threads with it and damage them. For this purpose, it is provided with a<br>
rounded tip both in the plan view as well as in the side view.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 33 to 35 differs from the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 29 to 33 only in the area of the connection between the<br>
band-shaped part of the gripper transport element 290' and the guiding<br>
part 22'. The difference is that still over a certain area in which the area<br>
XXXIII-XXXIII is laid, the longitudinal ribs 292 and 293 of the guiding part<br>
22* are elongated by longitudinal ribs 294, 295 of the band-shaped part<br>
that transform into the essentially rectangular cross-area of the band-<br>
shaped part of the gripper transport element 290'.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 36 essentially corresponds to the em-<br>
bodiment according to Fig. 11. The longitudinal grooves 82, 82', 87, 89,<br>
however, are relatively dimensioned to the shoulders of the guide element<br>
83 so that between the groove root of the longitudinal grooves 82, 82', 87,<br>
89 and the shoulders of the guide element 83 a clearance exists. In this<br>
area no abrasion occurs.<br>
Also in the embodiment according to Fig. 37, which essentially corre-<br>
sponds to the embodiment according to Fig. 12, clearance is provided be-<br>
tween the groove root of the longitudinal grooves 101, 102 of the gripper<br>
transport element 100' and the shoulders 105, 107 of the guide element<br>
103. In addition, outside on the shoulder 105 a shoulder 25 directed out-<br>
wards is provided, which forms a guide associated to the lower side of the<br>
gripper transport element 100'.<br><br>
P 44383 WO/IN	-16-<br>
All embodiments have the advantage that a gripper transport element is<br>
provided, which has a small cross-section and relatively large guide sur-<br>
faces. The small cross-section leads to the gripper transport element hav-<br>
ing a small mass, so that working with higher weaving speeds is possible.<br>
The invention is not limited to the shown and described exemplary em-<br>
bodiments. In fact, special embodiments of the individual exemplary em-<br>
bodiments can also be implemented in other exemplary embodiments. In<br>
particular, in all embodiments which are not expressly described, guiding<br>
parts also similar to the embodiment according to Fig. 4 to 7 or Fig. 29 to<br>
35 can be used, which complete or replace the gripper transport element<br>
over a part of its length and which can carry a gripper. When the longitu-<br>
dinal grooves are only provided in the guiding part, the horizontal guide is<br>
only limited to the area in which the guiding part is located. This is above<br>
all the area in which a gripper is mounted, which is generally then carried<br>
by the guiding part.<br><br>
