Method of Manufacturing Electric Resistance Welding Pipes<br>
Having Excellent Characterization of Welded Seams<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
manufacturing pipes required to have toughness of weld such<br>
as line pipes for oil wells, or pipes required to have strength<br>
of weld such as casings for oil wells.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, pipes are roughly classified into welding<br>
pipes and seamless pipes. An electric resistance welding pipe<br>
as one of the welding pipes is manufactured by rounding a sheet<br>
by roll forming or the like, and then confronting each edge<br>
and welding. In the welding pipes, toughness and strength of<br>
weld are generally bad compared with those of a mother strip.<br>
In use of the pipes, it is an inevitable problem to ensure<br>
certain toughness and strength of weld for each application.<br>
For example, since a line pipe for transporting crude<br>
oil or natural gas is often laid in a cold latitude, low<br>
temperature toughness is essentially concerned. Moreover,<br>
strength is importantly concerned with a casing for protecting<br>
a mining pipe in an oil well for mining crude oil.<br><br>
Typically, a hot-rolled sheet (strip) to be a mother<br>
strip of an electric resistance welding pipe is subjected to<br>
composition design or heat treatment in consideration of<br>
properties of the mother strip after being formed into a pipe<br>
so that properties of the mother strip such as toughness and<br>
strength are secured.<br>
However, since characterization of welded seams is<br>
severely affected by a method of the electric resistance<br>
welding rather than by the composition design or heat treatment<br>
of the mother strip, welding technique needs to be essentially<br>
improved.<br>
In many cases, the following phenomenon may by a cause<br>
of problems for electric resistance welding, that is, oxides<br>
called penetrators are generated on a strip edge, and the<br>
penetrators are not discharged from the edge along with<br>
discharge of melting steel during electric resistance welding<br>
and remained thereon, and the remained penetrators cause<br>
reduction in toughness, leading to insufficient strength.<br>
Thus, to remove the penetrators which are causes of<br>
conventional electric resistance welding failure from weld,<br>
earnest investigation has been made so far on an active<br>
discharging technique of melting steel from a strip edge in<br>
the weld. For example, patent documents 1 to 4 describe<br>
examples of investigation on a shape of each strip edge.<br>
Moreover, patent document 5 describes that lateral edges<br><br>
of a strip are chamfered in various shapes in order to<br>
facilitate adjustment of confronting pressure on edges at both<br>
sides of a strip in welding of an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe, and to improve welding reliability.<br>
Patent document 1: JP-A-57-031485<br>
Patent document 2: JP-A-63-317212<br>
Patent document 3: JP-A-2001-170779<br>
Patent document 4: JP-A-2003-164909<br>
Patent document 5: JP-A-2001-259733<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In any of the patent documents 1 to 4, it is intended<br>
that each strip edge is shaped with tapering so as to discharge<br>
the penetrators along with discharge of melting steel. The<br>
reason for shaping the tapering is considered to be due to a<br>
fact that the strip edge can be easily shaped with the tapering.<br>
However, when the strip edge is shaped with straight or planar<br>
tapering having a uniform slope, defects such as oxides may<br>
have not been adequately discharged along with discharge of<br>
melting steel.<br>
Moreover, the patent document 5 discloses various<br>
chamfer shapes for facilitating adjustment of confronting<br>
pressure. However, no description is found therein on a point<br>
of discharge of penetrators along with discharge of melting<br>
steel, and a point of improvement in characterization of welded<br><br>
seams (particularly low temperature toughness) through such<br>
discharge of penetrators. Therefore, a particular shape that<br>
is effective for improving the characterization of welded seams<br>
(particularly low temperature toughness) is completely<br>
unknown among the various chamfer shapes disclosed therein.<br>
In an actual manufacturing process of electric<br>
resistance welding pipes, strips having various kinds of<br>
thickness are subjected to roll forming to be into pipes. When<br>
means for shaping the tapering on each strip edge is solely<br>
used, for example, a cutting bite or a shaving roll needs to<br>
be adjusted in position to be installed at an accurate interval<br>
similar to strip thickness, which has been a cause of<br>
significant reduction in production efficiency.<br>
Thus, an object of the invention is to provide a method<br>
of efficiently manufacturing electric resistance welding<br>
pipes having excellent characterization of welded seams, which<br>
may adequately accelerate discharge of defects such as oxides<br>
along with discharge of melting steel, in addition, may not<br>
cause reduction in production efficiency.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In the invention, forming of a strip refers to operation<br>
of gradually rounding a strip in a lateral direction so as to<br>
make a section profile of the strip to be a circular shape,<br>
and a process of the forming includes an initial stage of roll<br>
forming in which portions near edges at both lateral sides of<br>
the strip are bent, and a finpass rolling stage in which the<br>
strip is finely finished into a circular section profile.<br>
In the invention, means for shaping the tapering on edges<br>
at one of an upper-surface side and a lower-surface side of<br>
a strip is in a type different from a type of means for shaping<br>
the tapering on edges at the other of the upper-surface side<br>
and the lower-surface side, which is opposite to the previous<br>
one surface side, that is, the edges are shaped with the<br>
tapering by a plurality of means. Thus, the edges at one<br>
surface side are shaped with the tapering, then the edges at<br>
the other surface side are shaped with the tapering. According<br>
to this, even if strip thickness is varied, a vertical position<br>
of an apparatus for shaping the tapering is simply adjusted,<br>
and thereby the edges at both of the upper-surface side and<br>
the lower-surface side of the strip can be shaped with the<br>
tapering without reduction of production efficiency.<br>
Thus, since the strip is approximately flat in a roll<br>
forming entrance side, the tapering is preferably shaped by<br>
cutting or shaving. Such shaping means of the tapering<br><br>
requires a relatively large installation space because its<br>
apparatus size is relatively large, therefore the means is<br>
hardly installed during or after roll forming since a space<br>
between two lateral edges of the strip, which are being or have<br>
been rounded, is reduced. Moreover, since the apparatus for<br>
cutting or shaving is hard to vertically constrain the edge<br>
of the strip only by the apparatus itself, high positioning<br>
accuracy is required for installation of the apparatus in<br>
conjunction with installation of an apparatus for accurately<br>
keeping a position through which the strip passes. Therefore,<br>
a station of each apparatus needs to be increased in stiffness,<br>
leading to requirement of a further large installation space.<br>
Thus, the cutting or shaving means is preferably installed<br>
before roll forming.<br>
Here, when the edges at both of the upper-surface side<br>
and the lower-surface side of the strip are cut or shaved, since<br>
a finpass roll is filled with the strip in finpass rolling<br>
during roll forming, the edges of the strip are strongly<br>
pressurized, so that the previously shaped tapering is<br>
sometimes crushed and thereby a desired shape may not be<br>
obtained. Therefore, it is preferable that the edges are<br>
previously shaped with a larger tapering than a desired<br>
tapering in consideration of crushing of the edges of the strip<br>
in the finpass rolling. However, when the edges at both of<br>
the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side of the strip<br><br>
are shaped with the tapering, large tapering is hardly obtained<br>
due to a limit of strip thickness, edges at only one of the<br>
upper-surface side and the lower-surface side of the strip are<br>
preferably cut or shaved.<br>
Next, the edges at the other surface side, which are still<br>
not shaped with the tapering, are shaped with the tapering by<br>
using finpass rolling. Since the edges at only one of the<br>
upper-surface side and the lower-surface side of the strip are<br>
shaped with the tapering from the above reason, the edges at<br>
the other surface side are preferably shaped with the tapering<br>
during or after roll forming in order to shape the tapering<br>
on both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side.<br>
Thus, the inventors noticed a phenomenon that the edges of the<br>
strip were easily crushed in the finpass rolling, and conceived<br>
use of the phenomenon. That is, when a fin of a finpass rolling<br>
roll is shaped with tapering in two stages, and a tapering angle<br>
of the fin and a contact position thereof to a strip edge are<br>
optimized depending on the amount of squeeze (upset) in finpass<br>
rolling, the edges at the other surface side which have not<br>
still shaped with the tapering can be also shaped with the<br>
tapering. Since such tapering work is performed by the finpass<br>
rolling itself, even if two edges, a space between which was<br>
reduced by rounding a strip in a lateral direction by roll<br>
forming, are extremely close to each other, the tapering work<br>
can be adequately carried out.<br><br>
In this way, even if strips are different in thickness,<br>
the rounded, two lateral edges of the strip immediately before<br>
welding are shaped with tapering as desired depending on strip<br>
thickness.<br>
The tapering is preferably shaped on the lateral edges<br>
at the upper-surface side of the strip to prevent the relatively<br>
large apparatus from interfering with a table for conveying<br>
the strip at a roll forming entrance side.<br>
The tapering is preferably shaped on the two lateral<br>
edges of the strip 20 such that a slope angle a from the lateral<br>
edge of the strip 20 to the upper or lower surface of the strip<br>
20 is 25° to 50° immediately before electric resistance welding,<br>
and a distance β between the tapering start position on the<br>
lateral edge of the strip 20 and the upper or lower surface<br>
is 20% to 40% of strip thickness.<br>
That is, when the slope angle a is less than 25°, melting<br>
steel is inadequately discharged from the central portion in<br>
thickness of the strip, and penetrators are defectively<br>
remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or strength after<br>
electric resistance welding, and when the slope angle a is more<br>
than 50°, the tapering is problematically remained as a flaw<br>
on a product pipe still after electric resistance welding.<br>
Moreover, when the distance β is less than 20% of thickness,<br>
melting steel is inadequately discharged from the central<br>
portion in strip thickness, so that the penetrators tend to<br><br>
be remained, and when the distance β is more than 40% of<br>
thickness, the tapering is problematically remained as a flaw<br>
on a product pipe still after electric resistance welding.<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention are described.<br>
A manufacturing line of electric resistance welding<br>
pipes used in the invention is shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes has<br>
a basic configuration where a strip 20 is uncoiled from an<br>
uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed to be flat by a leveler<br>
2; then the strip 20 is gradually rounded by a roll forming<br>
machine 5; then two lateral edges of the rounded strip 20 are<br>
subjected to electric resistance welding using an electric<br>
resistance welder including an induction heating section 6 and<br>
a squeeze roll (electric resistance welding section) 7 so as<br>
to be formed into a pipe 30; then a weld bead portion of the<br>
pipe 30 is cut by a bead cutter 8; then the pipe 30 after cutting<br>
is adjusted in outer diameter by a sizer 9; and then the pipe<br>
is cut out into a predetermined length by a pipe cutter 10.<br>
The roll forming machine 5 has a predetermined number (herein,<br>
two) of finpass forming stands 4 in a last stage.<br>
In the embodiment, in addition to the basic configuration,<br>
the manufacturing line has cutting or shaving means 31 for<br>
shaping the tapering on two lateral edges at an upper-surface<br>
side of the strip 20 between the leveler 2 and the roll forming<br>
machine 5 . As shown in Fig. 2 showing a diagram along an arrowed<br><br>
line A-A in Fig. 1, and in Figs. 3A and 3B showing partial detail<br>
diagram of Fig. 2 respectively, the cutting or shaving means<br>
31 rotates by a motor 3e a cutting tool 31a including cutting<br>
blades disposed in a roll shape (Fig. 3A), or a shaving stone<br>
31b in a roll shape (Fig. 3B) , and the cutting or shaving surface<br>
thereof is parallel to a roll axis. The cutting or shaving<br>
means 31 are disposed in pair in a lateral direction of the<br>
strip 20, and each roll axis is inclined by a predetermined<br>
angle y from a vertical direction, thereby two lateral edges<br>
at the upper-surface side of the strip 20 are shaped with<br>
predetermined tapering (a slope angle from the lateral edge<br>
to the upper surface is γ, and a distance in a strip thickness<br>
direction from the upper surface to a tapering start position<br>
on the lateral edge is 5) . Hereinafter, the cutting tool 31a<br>
including the cutting blades disposed in the roll shape is<br>
called cutting roll 31a, and the shaving stone 31b in the roll<br>
shape is called shaving roll 31b.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4A<br>
showing a diagram along an arrowed line B-B in Fig. 1 and in<br>
Fig. 4B showing a partial detail diagram of Fig. 4A, an end<br>
stand 4a of the finpass forming stand 4 has a fin shape including<br>
two-stage tapering (a second-stage tapering angle is a, and<br>
second-stage slope vertical-length is β) , and such a shape is<br>
printed to each lateral edge of the strip 20, thereby two<br>
lateral edges at a lower-surface side of the strip 20 (an<br><br>
outer-surface side of a pipe 30) are shaped with predetermined<br>
tapering (a slope angle from the lateral edge to the lower<br>
surface is a, and a distance in a strip thickness direction<br>
from a tapering start position on the lateral edge to the lower<br>
surface is β).<br>
In the manufacturing line of electric resistance welding<br>
pipes configured in the above, in the case that strips 20 having<br>
different kinds of thickness are successively threaded, when<br>
the predetermined tapering is shaped on two lateral edges at<br>
the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side of each strip<br>
.20, the two lateral edges at the upper-surface side of the strip<br>
20 are cut or shaved while the cutting roll 31a or the shaving<br>
roll 31b is inclined by the predetermined angle γ, and a position<br>
in a height direction of the roll 31a or 31b is finely adjusted,<br>
thereby the two lateral edges at the upper-surface side of the<br>
strip 20 are shaped with the predetermined tapering. In<br>
addition, the fin shape is printed to the two lateral edges<br>
at the lower-surface side of the strip 20 by the end stand 4a<br>
in finpass forming, thereby the two lateral edges at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip 20 are shaped with the<br>
predetermined tapering. Thus, since the hole-shape rolling<br>
roll needs not be changed depending on strip thickness, or a<br>
relative position of the cutting bite or the like needs not<br>
be set with taking a long time unlike in the prior art, the<br>
two lateral edges of the strip 20 can be shaped with the<br><br>
predetermined tapering depending on strip thickness without<br>
reducing production efficiency.<br>
As hereinbefore, in the embodiment, the two lateral edges<br>
of the strip 20 before electric resistance welding can be shaped<br>
with the appropriate tapering in response to change in<br>
thickness of the strip 20. Therefore, welding quality can be<br>
kept to be excellent, and reduction in production efficiency<br>
can be suppressed, and consequently an electric resistance<br>
welding pipe having excellent characterization of welded seams<br>
can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
In the embodiment, separately from the cutting or shaving<br>
means 31 for shaping the tapering on two lateral edges at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip 20, cutting or shaving means<br>
for cutting or shaving two lateral edges may be provided<br>
approximately parallel to the lateral edges of the strip 20<br>
at an upstream side of the means 31 as needed, so that the lateral<br>
edges of the strip 20 can be previously smoothened.<br>
A manufacturing line of electric resistance welding<br>
pipes used in another embodiment of the invention is<br>
approximately similar to the manufacturing line of electric<br>
resistance welding pipes used in the first embodiment, but<br>
different in that the cutting or shaving means 31 for shaping<br>
the tapering on the two lateral edges at the upper-surface side<br>
of the strip 20 is arranged between the leveler 2 and the roll<br>
forming machine 5.<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a diagram of the cutting or shaving means<br>
31 along an arrowed line A-A in Fig. 1. Figs. 6A and 6B show<br>
partial detail diagrams of the cutting or shaving means 31<br>
respectively. A cutting tool 31c (Fig. 6A) is a cutting tool<br>
in which cutting blades are disposed in a roll shape. A cutting<br>
surface of the cutting tool 31c has a shape where a portion<br>
approximately parallel to a roll axis is connected to a portion<br>
being outward inclined to the roll axis. A shaving stone 31d<br>
(Fig. 6B) has a roll shape. A shaving surface of the shaving<br>
stone 31d has a shape where a portion approximately parallel<br>
to a roll axis is connected to a portion being outward inclined<br>
to the roll axis. Hereinafter, the cutting tool 31c is called<br>
a cutting roll 31c with tapering, and the shaving stone 31d<br>
is called shaving roll 31d with tapering.<br>
By using the cutting roll 31c or the shaving roll 31d<br>
having such a shape, for strips having different kinds of<br>
thickness, lateral edges at an upper-surface side of each strip<br>
can be easily shaped with tapering being fixed in angle and<br>
position by one cutting roll 31c or shaving roll 31d.<br>
To shape the tapering on lateral edges at a lower-surface<br>
side of the strip 10, as in the first embodiment, as shown in<br>
Fig. 4A showing the diagram along the arrowed line B-B in Fig.<br>
1 and in Fig. 4B showing the partial detail diagram of Fig.<br>
4A, the end stand 4a of the finpass forming stand 4 has the<br>
fin shape including two-stage tapering (the second-stage<br><br>
tapering angle is a, and the second-stage slope vertical-length<br>
is β) , and such a shape is printed to the lateral edges of the<br>
strip 20, thereby the two lateral edges at the lower-surface<br>
side of the strip 20 (an outer surface side of the pipe 30)<br>
are shaped with predetermined tapering.<br>
Consequently, again in the embodiment, the two lateral<br>
edges of the strip 20 can be shaped with appropriate tapering<br>
in response to change in thickness of the strip 20 before<br>
electric resistance welding. Therefore, welding quality can<br>
be kept to be excellent, and reduction in production efficiency<br>
can be suppressed, and consequently an electric resistance<br>
welding pipe having excellent characterization of welded seams<br>
can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
In the first and second embodiments, tapering is shaped<br>
such that edges at the upper-surface side of the strip and edges<br>
at the lower-surface side thereof are in symmetry with respect<br>
to a center plane in strip thickness. However, this is not<br>
restrictive, and tapering may be shaped such that edges at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip and edges at the lower-surface<br>
side thereof are in asymmetry with respect to the central plane<br>
in strip thickness.<br>
In the case of a manufacturing line in which a forming<br>
direction of a strip is vertically opposite to that in the<br>
manufacturing line shown in Fig. 1 (i.e., in which the upper<br>
surface of the strip is an outer surface), the lateral edges<br><br>
at the lower-surface side of the strip can be shaped with the<br>
tapering by cutting or shaving before forming, and the lateral<br>
edges at the upper-surface side of the strip can be shaped with<br>
the tapering by finpass forming.<br>
As described before, the following phenomenon has been<br>
often as a cause of problems for electric resistance welding,<br>
that is, oxides called penetrators are generated on a strip<br>
edge, and the penetrators are not discharged from the edge along<br>
with discharge of melting steel during electric resistance<br>
welding and remained thereon, and the remained penetrators<br>
cause reduction in toughness, leading to insufficient<br>
strength.<br>
Thus, in any of the prior arts, it was intended that the<br>
strip edge was shaped with the tapering so as to discharge the<br>
penetrators along with discharge of melting steel. The reason<br>
for such shaping of the tapering is considered to be a fact<br>
that the strip edge is easily shaped. However, when the strip<br>
edge was shaped with straight or planar tapering, defects such<br>
as oxides were not adequately discharged along with discharge<br>
of melting steel in some cases.<br>
To clarify a cause of this phenomenon, the inventors made<br>
earnest investigation on it, as a result, the following was<br>
known. That is, melting steel generated at start of welding<br>
is small in amount on the strip edge being shaped with the<br>
tapering because of small contact area, then area is increased<br><br>
in a portion welded by upset (pressure-welding) in electric<br>
resistance welding, and the amount of melting steel is<br>
accordingly increased. However, it was found that in the prior<br>
tapering being shaped uniformly in a strip thickness direction,<br>
since a discharge angle (discharge amount) of melting steel<br>
was constant in the strip thickness direction, even if melting<br>
steel was adequately discharged from a portion near an end in<br>
strip thickness, it was sometimes inadequately discharged from<br>
a portion near the center in strip thickness, causing a<br>
phenomenon that melting steel that had been previously melted<br>
filled a strip surface and was solidified thereon to be into<br>
a lid, which sometimes blocked discharge of melting steel to<br>
be subsequently discharged from a welding surface.<br>
Thus, the inventors made earnest investigation on a<br>
method of excellently discharging melting steel continuously<br>
with passing of welding time. As a result, they understood<br>
that melting steel was small in amount during welding the<br>
portion near the center in strip thickness, and the melting<br>
steel was increased in amount during welding the portion near<br>
the end in strip thickness, therefore a particular edge shape<br>
was necessary for continuously discharging approximately<br>
constant amount of melting steel.<br>
The inventors investigated various shapes based on the<br>
result, as a result, they found that a strip edge was subjected<br>
to round shaping, thereby continuous discharge of melting steel<br><br>
was able to be excellently performed. That is, when the strip<br>
edge is subjected to round shaping, since the contact area is<br>
abruptly increased during welding the portion near the center<br>
in strip thickness, the discharge amount of melting steel is<br>
increased during that, and since the contact area is gradually<br>
increased during welding the portion near the end in strip<br>
thickness, the discharge amount of melting steel is decreased<br>
during that. Such operation enables stable discharge of<br>
melting steel, and eliminates the phenomenon that melting steel<br>
that has been previously discharged from a welding surface is<br>
solidified to be into a lid, blocking discharge of melting steel<br>
to be subsequently discharged.<br>
Thus, molting steel is adequately discharged from the<br>
strip edge so that penetrators can be sufficiently removed,<br>
as a result, characterization such as toughness or strength<br>
of welded seams can be held to be excellent.<br>
When the round shaping of the strip edge is performed<br>
to edges at both sides in a strip thickness direction (corners<br>
at both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side) ,<br>
a large effect is given.<br>
When the round shaping is performed by a hole-shape roll,<br>
since the strip edge is subjected to insufficient plastic<br>
working, a desired shape is hardly obtained. However, the<br>
desired shape can be directly obtained by performing the round<br>
shaping by cutting or stone grinding. Moreover, in finpass<br><br>
forming, the strip is rounded so as to make its section profile<br>
to be a circular shape, therefore the strip edge is strongly<br>
pressurized by a fin. Thus, the fin is previously shaped with<br>
a desired round shape, thereby a shape of the strip edge can<br>
be adequately close to the desired round shape.<br>
Thus, since the strip is approximately flat at a roll<br>
forming entrance side, the edges are preferably subjected to<br>
round shaping by cutting or stone grinding. Such means for<br>
performing round shaping requires a certain installation space<br>
because its apparatus size is relatively large, therefore the<br>
means is hardly installed during or after roll forming since<br>
a space between edges of the strip is reduced. Moreover, since<br>
the apparatus for cutting or shaving is hard to vertically<br>
constrain the strip only by the apparatus itself, high<br>
positioning accuracy is required for installation of the<br>
apparatus in conjunction with installation of an apparatus for<br>
accurately keeping a position through which the strip passes.<br>
Therefore, a station of the apparatus needs to be<br>
increased in stiffness, leading to requirement of a further<br>
large installation space. Here, when both of the upper and<br>
lower edges (corners at both of the upper-surface side and the<br>
lower-surface side) of the strip are cut or shaved, since a<br>
finpass rolling roll is filled with the strip in finpass rolling<br>
(which means finpass forming, hereinafter same as this) during<br>
roll forming, the edges of the strip are strongly pressurized,<br><br>
so that the previously shaped, round shape is sometimes crushed<br>
and thereby a desired shape may not be obtained. Therefore,<br>
it is preferable that a large round shape is previously shaped<br>
in consideration of crushing of each strip edge in the finpass<br>
rolling. However, when both of the upper and lower edges<br>
(corners at both of the upper-surface side and the<br>
lower-surface side) of the strip are shaped with a round shape,<br>
a large round shape is hardly obtained because of a limit of<br>
strip thickness, edges at only one side (corners at only one<br>
of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side) are<br>
preferably subjected to cutting or stone grinding.<br>
Next, the other edges (corners at the other surface side) ,<br>
which are not shaped with the round shape, are shaped with the<br>
round shape by using finpass rolling. Since edges at only one<br>
side are shaped with the round shape from the above reason,<br>
edges at an opposite side may be preferably shaped with the<br>
round shape during or after roll forming in order to shape the<br>
round shape on both edges.<br>
Thus, the inventors noticed a phenomenon that the edges<br>
of the strip were easily crushed in the finpass rolling, and<br>
conceived use of the phenomenon. That is, when a fin of a<br>
finpass rolling roll is shaped with a round shape, and an angle<br>
of the fin and a contact position thereof to a strip edge are<br>
optimized depending on the amount of squeezing (the amount of<br>
upset) in finpass rolling, edges at a side opposite to a side<br><br>
of the edges of the strip, which were shaped with the round<br>
shape before the roll forming, can be also shaped with the round<br>
shape. Since such round shaping is performed by the finpass<br>
rolling itself, even if a strip is laterally rounded by roll<br>
forming, thereby a distance between the lateral, two edges is<br>
reduced, or the edges are close to each other, the round shaping<br>
can be adequately carried out.<br>
In this way, the upper and lower, two edges of the strip<br>
(corners at both of the upper-surface side and the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip) can be shaped with the round<br>
shape immediately before electric resistance welding.<br>
The round shaping by cutting or shaving is preferably<br>
performed to the corners at the upper-surface side of the strip<br>
to prevent the relatively large apparatus from interfering with<br>
a table at a roll forming entrance side. Moreover, since a<br>
lower-surface side of the strip becomes an outer surface side<br>
(outer diameter side) of a pipe after roll forming, corners<br>
at the lower-surface side is preferably shaped with a round<br>
shape during finpass rolling using a fin being changed in shape.<br>
The inventors attempted to optimize the round shape<br>
immediately before electric resistance welding by using the<br>
cutting or grinding, or finpass rolling, as a result, they<br>
understood that radius R in round shaping was preferably 20<br>
to 50% of strip thickness. That is, when the radius R<br>
immediately before electric resistance welding is less than<br><br>
20% of strip thickness, melting steel is somewhat inadequately<br>
discharged from the central portion in strip thickness, so that<br>
the penetrators are somewhat remained, leading to slight<br>
reduction in toughness or strength after electric resistance<br>
welding.<br>
When the radius R is more than 50% of strip thickness,<br>
a distance in a strip width direction of a round-shaped portion<br>
becomes excessively small or excessively large. In the case<br>
of the excessively small distance, melting steel is<br>
inadequately discharged from the central portion in strip<br>
thickness, so that the penetrators are remained, leading to<br>
reduction in toughness or strength after electric resistance<br>
welding. On the other hand, in the case of the excessively<br>
large distance, upset is difficult, and consequently a<br>
phenomenon that thickness of a pipe becomes inadequate (a<br>
phenomenon that pipe thickness becomes below strip thickness)<br>
easily occurs near a boundary between weld and a mother strip.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, a<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes has,<br>
in addition to the basic configuration of Fig. 1, a hole-shape<br>
roll 32 for shaping the tapering on edges of the strip 20 between<br>
the leveler 2 and the roll forming machine 5.<br>
As shown in Figs. 8A and 8B, the hole-shape roll 32<br>
includes a surface parallel to a strip edge being approximately<br>
vertical and a surface inclined to the approximately vertical<br><br>
strip edge, the surfaces being connected to each other, and<br>
is movable in a vertical direction. A rotation method of the<br>
roll 32 may be designed, as an example shown in Fig. 8A, such<br>
that a surface parallel to the approximately vertical strip<br>
edge is made as a rotational body, and a rotation axis parallel<br>
to the approximately vertical strip edge is provided, or the<br>
method may be designed, as an example shown in Fig. 8B, such<br>
that a surface parallel to the surface inclined to the<br>
approximately vertical strip edge is made as a rotational body,<br>
and a rotation axis parallel to the surface inclined to the<br>
approximately vertical strip edge is provided.<br>
By rolling the strip 20 by such a hole-shape roll 32,<br>
as shown in Figs. 8A and 8B, edges at the upper-surface side<br>
of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) can be shaped<br>
with tapering in which an angle of the tapering from a surface<br>
of the strip edge toward a vertical direction (angle of the<br>
tapering toward a strip thickness direction) is y, and length<br>
of a perpendicular from a starting position to an end position<br>
of the tapering at one side (length of the tapering in the strip<br>
thickness direction) is δ.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4A showing a diagram along<br>
an arrowed line B-B in Fig. 1 and in Fig. 4B showing a partial<br>
detail diagram of Fig. 4A, in the embodiment, the end stand<br>
4a of the finpass forming stand 4 has a fin shape including<br>
predetermined two-stage tapering (a second-stage tapering<br><br>
angle is a, and second-stage slope vertical-length is (3) . Such<br>
a fin shape is printed to each lateral edge of the strip 20,<br>
thereby two lateral edges at a lower-surface side of the strip<br>
20 (outer surface side of the pipe 30) can be shaped with the<br>
predetermined tapering.<br>
Thus, when tapering is shaped on edges at an<br>
upper-surface side and a lower-surface side of strips having<br>
different kinds of thickness, the edges at the upper-surface<br>
side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are<br>
rolled at predetermined positions in a strip thickness<br>
direction using the hole-shape roll 32 with a vertical position<br>
thereof being finely adjusted. On the other hand, the edges<br>
at the lower-surface side of the strip 20 (outer-surface side<br>
of the pipe 30) are printed with tapering at predetermined<br>
positions in a strip thickness direction by finpass forming.<br>
Thus, the edges of both of the upper and lower surfaces of the<br>
strip can be shaped with the predetermined tapering depending<br>
on strip thickness without reducing production efficiency.<br>
In this way, the surface parallel to the strip edge and<br>
the surface inclined to the strip edge are provided, and the<br>
vertically movable hole-shape roll 32 is combined with the<br>
finpass end stand 4a having the fin shape including two-stage<br>
tapering so that both of the edges at the upper-surface side<br>
and the edges at the lower-surface side of the strip are shaped<br>
with the tapering. Therefore, even if strips having different<br><br>
kinds of thickness are shaped with tapering, efficiency is not<br>
reduced. Moreover, even if a strip is greatly varied in<br>
thickness, the hole-shape roll is not applied with an excessive<br>
load, therefore the hole-shape roll may not be broken.<br>
The tapering shaped by the hole-shape roll 32 and the<br>
finpass end stand 4a is preferably made such that an angle a<br>
or γ of tapering immediately before electric resistance welding<br>
from the surface of the strip edge toward the vertical direction<br>
is in a range of 25° to 50°, and length β or δ of a perpendicular<br>
from the starting position to the end position of the tapering<br>
at one side is 20% to 40% of strip thickness.<br>
That is, when the tapering angle α or γ is less than 25°,<br>
melting steel is inadequately discharged from the central<br>
portion in strip thickness, so that penetrators are defectively<br>
remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or strength after<br>
electric resistance welding, and when the tapering angle a or<br>
γ is more than 50°, the tapering is problematically remained<br>
as a flaw on a product pipe still after electric resistance<br>
welding. Moreover, when the tapering height β or δ is less than<br>
20% of strip thickness, melting steel is inadequately<br>
discharged from the central portion in strip thickness, so that<br>
the penetrators tend to be remained, and when the tapering<br>
height β or δ is more than 40% of strip thickness, the tapering<br>
is problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe still<br>
after electric resistance welding.<br><br>
In this way, in the embodiment, since the edges of the<br>
strip can be appropriately shaped with the tapering before<br>
electric resistance welding, an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe having significantly excellent toughness and welding<br>
strength can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
In the embodiment, the edges at the upper-surface side<br>
of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) are shaped with the tapering by finpass forming.<br>
However, in some case, the edges at the lower-surface side of<br>
the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the pipe 30) may be shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) may be shaped with the tapering by finpass forming.<br>
The above description was made assuming a manufacturing<br>
line in which the upper-surface side of the strip 20 corresponds<br>
to the inner-surface side of the pipe 30. However, it is<br>
obvious that the invention can be similarly applied to a<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes, in<br>
which the upper-surface side of the strip 20 corresponds to<br>
the outer-surface side of the pipe 30.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, a<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes has,<br>
in addition to the basic configuration of Fig. 1, a hole-shape<br><br>
roll 32 for shaping the tapering on edges of the strip 20 between<br>
the leveler 2 and the roll forming machine 5.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the hole-shape roll 32 has a rolling<br>
surface 32a including a vertical rolling surface 32a1 and a<br>
rolling surface 32a2 being inclined at an angle γ, and has flange<br>
portions 32b at upper and lower ends of the rolling surface 32a<br>
and has a vertical rotation axis. Here, width of the rolling<br>
surface 3a is approximately the same as thickness of the strip<br>
20, and the upper and lower flange portions 3b pinch the strip<br>
20 so as to constrain the strip 20 in a vertical direction (strip<br>
thickness direction).<br>
By rolling the strip 20 by such a hole-shape roll 32,<br>
as shown in Fig. 9, edges at the upper-surface side of the strip<br>
20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) can be shaped with<br>
tapering in which an angle of the tapering with respect to a<br>
surface of the strip edge toward a vertical direction (angle<br>
of the tapering toward a strip thickness direction) is γ, and<br>
length of a perpendicular from a starting position to an end<br>
position of the tapering (length of the tapering in the strip<br>
thickness direction) at one side is δ.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4A<br>
showing a diagram along an arrowed line B-B in Fig. 1 and in<br>
Fig. 4B showing a partial detail diagram of Fig. 4A, the end<br>
stand 4a of the finpass rolling stand 4 has a fin shape including<br>
predetermined two-stage tapering (a second-stage tapering<br><br>
angle is a, and second-stage slope vertical-length is β) . Such<br>
a fin shape is printed to each lateral edge of the strip 20,<br>
thereby two lateral edges at a lower-surface side of the strip<br>
20 (outer surface side of the pipe 30) can be shaped with the<br>
predetermined tapering.<br>
The tapering shaped by the hole-shape roll 32 and the<br>
tapering by the finpass end stand 4a are preferably made such<br>
that an angle a or γ of tapering immediately before electric<br>
resistance welding from the surface of the strip edge toward<br>
the vertical direction is in a range of 25° to 50°, and length<br>
(3 or 8 of a perpendicular from the starting position to the<br>
end position of the tapering at one side is 20% to 40% of strip<br>
thickness.<br>
That is, when the tapering angle a or γ is less than 25°,<br>
melting steel is inadequately discharged from the central<br>
portion in strip thickness, so that penetrators are defectively<br>
remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or strength after<br>
electric resistance welding, and when the tapering angle a or γ<br>
 is more than 50°, the tapering is problematically remained<br>
as a flaw on a product pipe still after electric resistance<br>
welding. Moreover, when the tapering height β or δ is less than<br>
20% of strip thickness, melting steel is inadequately<br>
discharged from the central portion in strip thickness, so that<br>
the penetrators tend to be remained, and when the tapering<br>
height β or δ is more than 40% of strip thickness, the tapering<br><br>
is problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe still<br>
after electric resistance welding.<br>
In this way, in the embodiment, since the edges of the<br>
strip can be appropriately shaped with the tapering before<br>
electric resistance welding, an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe having significantly excellent toughness and welding<br>
strength can be manufactured.<br>
In the embodiment, the edges at the upper-surface side<br>
of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) are shaped with the tapering by finpass rolling.<br>
However, in some case, the edges at the lower-surface side of<br>
the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the pipe 30) may be shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) may be shaped with the tapering by finpass rolling.<br>
Moreover, while the above description was made assuming<br>
a manufacturing line in which the upper-surface side of the<br>
strip 20 corresponds to the inner-surface side of the pipe 30,<br>
it is obvious that the invention can be similarly applied to<br>
a manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes, in<br>
which the upper-surface side of the strip 20 corresponds to<br>
the outer-surface side of the pipe 30.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors made investigation on means<br><br>
for shaping the tapering on each strip edge without reducing<br>
production efficiency even if thickness is varied.<br>
As a result, means for shaping the tapering is changed<br>
between the edges at the upper-surface side of the strip and<br>
the edges at the lower-surface side of the strip, consequently<br>
a plurality of means are used to shape the tapering. That is,<br>
the edges at the upper-surface side of the strip and the edges<br>
at the lower-surface side thereof are shaped with the tapering<br>
by the plurality of means, and edges at one surface side is<br>
shaped with the tapering, then edges at the other surface side<br>
is shaped with the tapering. Thus, even if thickness is varied,<br>
a vertical position of the means for shaping the tapering is<br>
simply finely adjusted, and thereby both of the upper and lower<br>
edges of the strip can be shaped with the tapering without<br>
reducing production efficiency.<br>
In this case, since a strip before roll forming is approximately<br>
flat, edges of the strip at one of the surface sides are<br>
preferably shaped with the tapering by cutting or grinding<br>
before roll forming. However, since the edges of the strip<br>
are not work-hardened, the following event may be caused as<br>
described before, that is, the edges of the strip are greatly<br>
deformed due to an effect of strong pressure on the edges of<br>
the strip during finpass forming, consequently most of the<br>
shaped tapering may be broken.<br>
Thus, the inventors variously made investigation on how<br><br>
the strip edge is deformed so as to break the tapering during<br>
finpass forming. The finpass forming is typically carried out<br>
with two or three stands.<br>
As a result, the following was recognized. That is, in<br>
the finpass first-stand, since edges of the strip at an entrance<br>
side are substantially not work-hardened, tapering is broken<br>
by about 40% to 60% in length in a strip thickness direction.<br>
In the finpass second-stand, since the edges of the strip have<br>
been work-hardened through strong pressurization by the<br>
finpass first-stand, 10% to 30% of the remained tapering is<br>
broken. Furthermore, if certain number of stands were added<br>
behind the second stand, 10% to 30% of tapering remained in<br>
a previous stand is broken in each stand.<br>
On the other hand, as a result of investigation on an<br>
optimum tapering shape immediately before electric resistance<br>
welding after finpass forming, it was understood that an angle<br>
from a perpendicular (angle of tapering toward a strip<br>
thickness direction) was preferably in a range of 25° to 50°,<br>
and length of a perpendicular (length of tapering in a strip<br>
thickness direction) from the starting position to the end<br>
position of the tapering was preferably 20% to 40% of strip<br>
thickness.<br>
That is, when the angle from the perpendicular is less<br>
than 25°, melting steel is inadequately discharged from the<br>
central portion in strip thickness, so that penetrators are<br><br>
defectively remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or<br>
strength after electric resistance welding, and when the angle<br>
from the perpendicular is more than 50°, the tapering is<br>
problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe still after<br>
electric resistance welding. Moreover, when the length of the<br>
perpendicular from the starting position to the end position<br>
of the tapering is less than 20% of strip thickness, melting<br>
steel is inadequately discharged from the central portion in<br>
strip thickness, so that the penetrators tend to be remained,<br>
and when the length is more than 40% of strip thickness, the<br>
tapering is problematically remained as a flaw on a product<br>
pipe still after electric resistance welding.<br>
From the results, it was understood that when the<br>
tapering to be previously shaped on the edges of the strip at<br>
one surface side by cutting or grinding before roll forming<br>
(before finpass forming) was calculated backward, the length<br>
of the perpendicular from the starting position to the end<br>
position of the tapering was preferably 50% to 90% of strip<br>
thickness.<br>
Finpass forming in the middle of roll forming is<br>
preferably used for shaping the tapering on edges of the strip<br>
at the other surface side. The reason for this is as follows.<br>
Since the finpass roll is filled with the strip in the finpass<br>
forming, the edges of the strip are strongly pressurized during<br>
the finpass forming. Therefore, in the finpass forming, it<br><br>
is preferable that a fin shape is made to include at least two<br>
stages of tapering, and the fin shape is printed to the strip<br>
by using the strong pressure on the edges of the strip.<br>
The tapering shaped in the finpass forming is made, as<br>
described before, such that the angle from the perpendicular<br>
(angle of tapering toward a strip thickness direction) is 25°<br>
to 50°, and length of the perpendicular from the starting<br>
position to the end position of the tapering (length of tapering<br>
in a strip thickness direction) is 20% to 40% of strip thickness,<br>
which corresponds to the optimum tapering shape after the<br>
finpass forming and immediately before electric resistance<br>
welding.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a manufacturing line of electric resistance<br>
welding pipes according to an embodiment of the invention,<br>
which is configured based on the above consideration. The<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes has<br>
a basic configuration where a strip 20 is uncoiled from an<br>
uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed to be flat by a leveler<br>
2; then the strip 20 is gradually rounded by a roll forming<br>
machine 5; then two lateral edges of the rounded strip 20 are<br>
subjected to electric resistance welding using an electric<br>
resistance welder including an induction heating section 6 and<br>
a squeeze roll (electric resistance welding section) 7 so as<br>
to be formed into a pipe 30; then a weld bead portion of the<br>
pipe 30 is cut by a bead cutter 8; then the pipe 30 after cutting<br><br>
is adjusted in outer diameter by a sizer 9; and then the pipe<br>
is cut out into a predetermined length by a pipe cutter 10.<br>
The roll forming machine 5 has a finpass forming stand 4 having<br>
a predetermined number of stands (herein, two stands) in a last<br>
stage.<br>
In the embodiment, in addition to the basic configuration,<br>
the manufacturing line has a pair of cutting tools, each having<br>
cutting blades disposed in a roll shape, (or roll-shape<br>
grinding stones) 3 in a lateral direction of the strip 20<br>
between the leveler 2 and the roll forming machine 5. Thus,<br>
as shown in Fig. 10, two lateral edges at the upper-surface<br>
side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are<br>
shaped with the tapering in which an angle toward a strip<br>
thickness direction (tapering angle) γ is 25° to 40°, and length<br>
of the tapering in the strip thickness direction (tapering<br>
height) δ is 50% to 90% of strip thickness.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4A<br>
showing a diagram along an arrowed line B-B in Fig. 1 and in<br>
Fig. 4B showing a partial detail diagram of Fig. 4A, the end<br>
stand 4a of the finpass forming stand 4 has a fin shape including<br>
predetermined two-stage tapering (a second-stage tapering<br>
angle is α, and second-stage slope vertical-length is (3) . Such<br>
a fin shape is printed to the lateral edges of the strip 20,<br>
thereby two lateral edges at a lower-surface side of the strip<br>
20 (an outer surface side of the pipe 30) are shaped with<br><br>
tapering in which an angle toward a strip thickness direction<br>
(tapering angle) is 25° to 40°, and length of the tapering in<br>
the strip thickness direction (tapering height) is 20% to 40%<br>
of strip thickness.<br>
Thus, when tapering is shaped on edges at an<br>
upper-surface side and a lower-surface side of strips having<br>
different kinds of thickness, the edges at the upper-surface<br>
side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are<br>
subjected to cutting or shaving at predetermined positions in<br>
a strip thickness direction using the cutting tools, each<br>
having cutting blades disposed in a roll shape, (or roll-shape<br>
grinding stones) 3 with a vertical position thereof being<br>
finely adjusted. On the other hand, the edges at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) are printed with tapering at predetermined positions<br>
in a strip thickness direction by finpass forming. Thus, the<br>
edges of both of the upper and lower surfaces of the strip can<br>
be shaped with the predetermined tapering depending on strip<br>
thickness without reducing production efficiency.<br>
In this case, strip width is sometimes significantly<br>
decreased due to end crushing in finpass forming. Therefore,<br>
to correct the strip width, a strip is previously increased<br>
in width by amount corresponding to such decrease in strip width,<br>
and the strip is used to manufacture an electric resistance<br>
welding pipe. Thus, an electric resistance welding pipe<br><br>
having a desired outer-diameter can be easily manufactured.<br>
In this way, in the embodiment, since the edges of the<br>
strip can be appropriately shaped with the tapering before<br>
electric resistance welding, an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe having significantly excellent toughness and welding<br>
strength can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
In the embodiment, the edges at the upper-surface side<br>
of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the pipe 30) are shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) are shaped with the tapering by finpass forming.<br>
However, in some case, the edges at the lower-surface side of<br>
the strip 20 (outer-surface side of the pipe 30) may be shaped<br>
with the tapering before roll forming, and the edges at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip 20 (inner-surface side of the<br>
pipe 30) may be shaped with the tapering by finpass forming.<br>
The above description was made assuming a manufacturing<br>
line in which the upper-surface side of the strip 20 corresponds<br>
to the inner-surface side of the pipe 30. However, it is<br>
obvious that the invention can be similarly applied to a<br>
manufacturing line of electric resistance welding pipes, in<br>
which the upper-surface side of the strip 20 corresponds to<br>
the outer-surface side of the pipe 30.<br>
Example 1<br><br>
Hereinafter, description is made according to examples.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a pipe manufacturing machine used in the<br>
examples. A pipe manufacturing method using the pipe<br>
manufacturing machine is as follows. A strip 20 is uncoiled<br>
from an uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed to be flat by<br>
a leveler 2; then the strip is gradually rounded laterally by<br>
a roll forming machine 5; then two lateral edges of the<br>
laterally rounded strip are subjected to electric resistance<br>
welding using an electric resistance welder (including an<br>
induction heating section 6 and a squeeze roll (electric<br>
resistance welding section) 7) so as to be formed into a pipe<br>
30; then a weld bead portion of the pipe 30 is cut by a bead<br>
cutter 8; then the pipe 30 after cutting is adjusted in outer<br>
diameter by a sizer 9; and then the pipe is cut out into a<br>
predetermined length by a pipe cutter 10. The roll forming<br>
machine 5 has a breakdown first stand 13 at a former stage side,<br>
and a finpass rolling stand 4 in a last stage.<br>
In addition to the above basic configuration, at an<br>
entrance side of the roll forming machine 5 and at an exit side<br>
of the leveler 2, as cutting or shaving means 31, a tool<br>
including cutting blades in a roll shape is arranged, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2, such that the roll-shape cutting blades cut portions<br>
at an upper-surface side of two lateral edges of the strip 20<br>
so that the portions can be shaped with tapering having a<br>
predetermined tapering angle γ and a predetermined tapering<br><br>
distance δ, and a finpass rolling roll of the finpass rolling<br>
first-stand 4A is made to have a fin including tapering in two<br>
stages as shown in Fig. 4A such that portions at a lower-surface<br>
side of the two lateral edges of the strip 20, which is being<br>
laterally rounded, are rolled so that the portions can be shaped<br>
with tapering having a predetermined tapering angle a and a<br>
predetermined tapering distance β.<br>
(Example of the invention 1)<br>
In an example of the invention 1, using the pipe<br>
manufacturing machine of Fig. 1, steel pipes (pipes) 600 mm<br>
in outer diameter were manufactured from a steel strip (strip<br>
A) 1920 mm in width and 19 .1 mm in thickness . Then, steel pipes<br>
(pipes) 600 mm in outer diameter were manufactured from a steel<br>
strip (strip B) 1920 mm in width and 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
During pipe manufacturing, tapering was shaped on lateral edges<br>
at an upper-surface side of the strip by the cutting or shaving<br>
means 31, and shaped on lateral edges at an lower-surface side<br>
of the strip by the finpass rolling roll of the finpass rolling<br>
first-stand 4A, respectively. The tapering was made to have<br>
a tapering angle α of 30° and a tapering distance β of 5 mm<br>
(26% of strip thickness) in both of an upper-surface side and<br>
a lower-surface side in the strip A, and the tapering was made<br>
to have a tapering angle a of 30° and a tapering distance β<br>
 of 2.5 mm (22% of strip thickness) in both of an upper-surface<br>
side and a lower-surface side in the strip B. when a strip<br><br>
is changed from the strip A (19.1 mm in thickness) to the strip<br>
B (11.3 mm in thickness), a position of the cutting or shaving<br>
means 31 was moved downward by 7.8 mm to finely adjust a cutting<br>
position.<br>
Test pieces were cut out from weld of the manufactured<br>
steel pipes, and subjected to a Charpy test to evaluate<br>
performance of the pipes. Charpy test pieces were sampled by<br>
one for each of ten different points in a pipe length direction<br>
in a manner that a longitudinal direction of the test piece<br>
was parallel to a pipe circumferential direction, and a<br>
longitudinal center of a notch corresponded to a central<br>
position in thickness of the weld. The test pieces were formed<br>
as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test pieces, and subjected to an<br>
impact test at -46°C, and absorbed energy and brittle fracture<br>
surface ratios were measured. Absorbed energy of 125 Jor more,<br>
and a brittle fracture surface ratio of 35% or less were<br>
specified as an allowable range of performance respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 2)<br>
In an example of the invention 2, the tapering angle a<br>
in the example 1 is changed to 40°, and except for this, pipes<br>
are manufactured and subjected to the Charpy test to evaluate<br>
performance thereof in the same way as in the example 1.<br>
(Comparative example 1)<br>
In a comparative example 1, the pipe manufacturing<br>
machine as shown in Fig. 1 was used. Furthermore, in addition<br><br>
to the basic configuration of the machine, a hole-shape rolling<br>
roll 32 as shown in Fig. 9 was arranged in place of the cutting<br>
or shaving means 31 at an entrance side of the roll forming<br>
machine 5, that is, an exit side of the leveler 2 such that<br>
two lateral edges of the strip 20 were rolled so that the two<br>
edges at both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface<br>
side were able to be concurrently shaped with tapering having<br>
a predetermined tapering angle α and a predetermined tapering<br>
distance L. In the finpass rolling roll of the finpass rolling<br>
stand 4, a fin does not have two-stage tapering in any roll<br>
as in the typical case.<br>
Using the pipe manufacturing machine of Fig. 1, steel<br>
pipes (pipes) 600 mm in outer diameter were manufactured from<br>
a steel strip (strip A) 1920 mm in width and 19.1 mm in thickness.<br>
Then, steel pipes (pipes) 600 mm in outer diameter were<br>
manufactured from a steel strip (strip B) 1920 mm in width and<br>
11.3 mm in thickness. During pipe manufacturing, portions at<br>
both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side of<br>
lateral edges of the strip were rolled by a hole-shape rolling<br>
roll 12 so that the portions were shaped with tapering. A shape<br>
of the tapering was made to be the same shape as in the example<br>
of the invention 1. When a strip is changed from the strip<br>
A (19.1 mm in thickness) to the strip B (11.3 mm in thickness),<br>
operation of the pipe manufacturing machine was temporarily<br>
stopped, and the hole-shape roll 12 for shaping the tapering<br><br>
was changed from a roll for the strip 19.1 mm in thickness to<br>
a roll for the strip 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
The manufactured steel pipes were subjected to a Charpy<br>
test to evaluate performance of the pipes as in the example<br>
of the invention 1.<br>
(Prior art example 1)<br>
A pipe manufacturing machine, was configured by removing<br>
the hole-shape roll 32 for shaping the tapering and the cutting<br>
or shaving means 31 from the pipe manufacturing machine of Fig.<br>
1 in the comparative example 1. During pipe manufacturing,<br>
the strip 20 was not shaped with tapering at two lateral edges,<br>
and was kept to have a rectangular section profile. Except<br>
for this, steel pipes are manufactured and subjected to the<br>
Charpy test to evaluate performance thereof in the same way<br>
as in the comparative example 1.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the steel pipes<br>
manufactured according to the examples, and results of the<br>
measurements are shown in Table 1. Production efficiency in<br>
each of the examples is also shown in Table 1. The production<br>
efficiency is shown by relative ratios of reciprocals of<br>
production time to a value (normalized to 1) in the prior art<br>
example 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
From Table 1, in a product steel pipe according to the<br>
prior art example 1, weld has low impact strength and a large<br>
brittle fracture surface ratio, that-is, toughness is reduced,<br>
and reliability of products is low. In a product steel pipe<br>
according to the comparative example 1, weld has high impact<br>
strength and a small brittle fracture surface ratio compared<br>
with the prior art example 1, that is, toughness is excellent,<br>
and reliability of products is high, but production efficiency<br>
is reduced. In contrast to these, in a steel pipe according<br>
to each of the examples of the invention 1 and 2, it is clear<br>
that the weld has toughness equal to or higher than that in<br>
the comparative example 1, in addition, production efficiency<br>
is high in approximately the same level as in the prior art<br>
example 1.<br>
While the tapering shaped in the example is made such<br><br>
that the upper-surface side of the strip and the lower-surface<br>
side thereof are in symmetry with respect to a center plane<br>
in strip thickness, this is not restrictive, and tapering may<br>
be shaped such that the upper-surface side of the strip and<br>
the lower-surface side thereof are in asymmetry with respect<br>
to the center plane in strip thickness. When a pipe<br>
manufacturing machine vertically opposite to the machine of<br>
Fig. 1 (that is, the upper-surface side of the strip corresponds<br>
to an outer-surface side of a pipe) is used, it is preferable<br>
that tapering is shaped on portions at the lower-surface side<br>
of lateral edges of the strip by cutting or shaving before<br>
forming, and tapering is shaped by finpass rolling on portions<br>
at the upper-surface side of the lateral edges of the strip.<br>
Example 2<br>
Here, electric resistance welding pipes 600 mm in<br>
diameter were manufactured using a strip (steel strip) 1920<br>
mm in width and 19.1 mm in thickness . Then, electric resistance<br>
welding pipes 600 mm in diameter were manufactured using a strip<br>
(steel strip) 1920 mm in width and 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
Then, test pieces were cut out from weld of the<br>
manufactured electric resistance welding pipes, and subjected<br>
to a Charpy test to evaluate performance of the pipes. Charpy<br>
test pieces were sampled by one for each of ten different points<br>
in a pipe length direction in a manner that a longitudinal<br><br>
direction of the test piece was parallel to a pipe<br>
circumferential direction, and a longitudinal center of a notch<br>
corresponded to a central position in thickness of the weld.<br>
The test pieces were formed as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test<br>
pieces, and subjected to an impact test at -46°C, and absorbed<br>
energy and brittle fracture surface ratios were measured.<br>
Absorbed energy of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture surface<br>
ratio of 35% or less were specified as an allowable range of<br>
performance respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 21)<br>
As an example of the invention 21, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
first embodiment. In manufacturing, the cutting roll 31a<br>
shown in Fig. 3A was used as the cutting or shaving means 31<br>
for shaping the tapering on both lateral edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip. The slope angle α of tapering<br>
was made to be 30° at both of the upper-surface side and a<br>
lower-surface side. When strip thickness was changed from<br>
19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, a vertical position of the cutting roll<br>
31a was moved downward by 7.8 mm to be finely adjusted.<br>
(Example of the invention 22)<br>
As an example of the invention 22, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
first embodiment. In manufacturing, the shaving roll 31b<br>
shown in Fig. 3B was used as the cutting or shaving means 31<br><br>
for shaping the tapering on both lateral edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip. The slope angle a of tapering<br>
was made to be 40° at both of the upper-surface side and a<br>
lower-surface side. When strip thickness was changed from<br>
19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, a vertical position of the shaving roll<br>
31b was moved downward by 7.8 mm to be finely adjusted.<br>
(Example of the invention 23)<br>
As an example of the invention 23, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
second embodiment. In manufacturing, the cutting roll with<br>
tapering 31c shown in Fig. 6A was used as the cutting or shaving<br>
means 31 for shaping the tapering on both lateral edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip. The slope angle a of tapering<br>
was made to be 30° at both of the upper-surface side and a<br>
lower-surface side. When strip thickness was changed from<br>
19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, a vertical position of the cutting roll<br>
with tapering 31c was moved downward by 7.8 mm to be finely<br>
adjusted.<br>
(Example of the invention 24)<br>
As an example of the invention 24, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
second embodiment. In manufacturing, the shaving roll with<br>
tapering 31d shown in Fig. 6B was used as the cutting or shaving<br>
means 31 for shaping the tapering on both lateral edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip. The slope angle a of tapering<br><br>
was made to be 40° at both of the upper-surface side and a<br>
lower-surface side. When strip thickness was changed from<br>
19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, a vertical position of the shaving roll<br>
with tapering 31d was moved downward by 7.8 mm to be finely<br>
adjusted.<br>
(Comparative example 2)<br>
As a comparative example 2, the above electric resistance<br>
welding pipes were manufactured through the manufacturing line<br>
shown in Fig. 1 while a hole-shape rolling roll was provided<br>
between the leveler 2 and the roll forming machine 5, and the<br>
hole-shape rolling roll was used to shape the tapering on both<br>
lateral edges at an upper-surface side and a lower-surface side<br>
of the strip. The slope angle a of the tapering was made to<br>
be 30° at both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface<br>
side. In manufacturing, the cutting or shaving means 31 was<br>
removed, and a fin shape of the finpass forming end stand 4a<br>
was made to include usual one-stage tapering. When strip<br>
thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, the manufacturing<br>
line was temporarily stopped, and the hole-shape rolling roll<br>
was changed from a roll for the strip 19.1 mm in thickness to<br>
a roll for the strip 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
(Prior-art example 2)<br>
As a prior-art example 2, the above electric resistance<br>
welding pipes were manufactured through the manufacturing line<br>
shown in Fig. 1 while both lateral edges of the strip were<br><br>
smoothly ground between the leveler 2 and the roll forming<br>
machine 5. In manufacturing, the cutting or shaving means 31<br>
was removed, and a fin shape of the finpass forming end stand<br>
4a was made to include usual one-stage tapering. When strip<br>
thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, manufacturing<br>
was continued without stopping the manufacturing line.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the electric<br>
resistance welding pipes manufactured according to the<br>
examples, and results of the measurements are shown in Table<br>
2. The table also shows a ratio of production efficiency in<br>
each example to production efficiency, which is assumed to be<br>
1, in the comparative example 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
From Table 2, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br><br>
according to the examples of the invention 21 to 24, weld has<br>
high impact strength and a small brittle fracture surface ratio,<br>
that is, toughness is excellent, and reliability of products<br>
is high. In contrast, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
according to the prior art example 2, weld has low impact<br>
strength and a large brittle fracture surface ratio, that is,<br>
toughness is reduced, and reliability of products is low.<br>
Moreover, the examples of the invention 21 to 24 are<br>
significantly improved in production efficiency compared with<br>
the comparative example 2.<br>
Consequently, it was confirmed that an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seams was able to be efficiently manufactured according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Example 3<br>
Hereinafter, description is made according to an example.<br>
In the example, the pipe manufacturing equipment shown in Fig.<br>
1, or partially modified equipment of this was used. The pipe<br>
manufacturing equipment is configured by an uncoiler 1, a<br>
leveler 2, a roll forming machine 5, induction heating means<br>
(induction heating coil) 6, a squeeze roll 7, bead cutting means<br>
(bead cutting bite) 8, a sizer 9, and a pipe cutter 10, those<br>
being disposed in this order. The roll forming machine 5<br>
includes a plurality of roll stands arranged over stages from<br><br>
a coarse forming stage including a breakdown first stand 13<br>
to a finish forming stage including a finpass forming roll 4.<br>
In the pipe manufacturing equipment, a strip (sheet) 20<br>
is uncoiled by the uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed to<br>
be flat by the leveler 2; then the strip is laterally gradually<br>
rounded by the plurality of roll stands arranged over the stages<br>
from the coarse forming stage to the finish forming stage of<br>
the roll forming machine 5; and then the strip is subjected<br>
to finish forming by the finpass forming roll 4 . Since lateral<br>
rounding of the strip 20 is substantially started from the<br>
breakdown first stand 13, a portion before roll forming refers<br>
to a portion from an exit side of the leveler 2 to an entrance<br>
side of the breakdown first stand 13.<br>
The strip 20 is formed into an opened-pipe shape after<br>
the finish forming, and two edges in a lateral direction<br>
(circumferential direction of the opened pipe) of the strip<br>
is heated by the induction heating means 6, and then contacted<br>
by pressing (subjected to electric resistance welding) by the<br>
squeeze roll 7 to form a pipe. Then, a bead of weld of the<br>
pipe is removed by cutting using the bead cutting means 8, and<br>
then the pipe is subjected to constant-diameter rolling by the<br>
sizer 9, and then the pipe is cut into a predetermined length<br>
by the pipe cutter 10.<br>
In the pipe manufacturing equipment of Fig. 1, as an<br>
example of the embodiment of the invention, stone grinding<br><br>
means 31 for round shaping (refer to Fig. 7) of each corner<br>
at the upper-surface side of the strip is disposed at a roll<br>
forming entrance side. In addition, fin corners of the finpass<br>
forming roll 4 are shaped with a round shape in place of the<br>
tapering, so that each corner at the lower-surface side of the<br>
strip (outer-diameter side of the pipe) is round-shaped by<br>
finpass forming.<br>
A steel strip 1920 mm in width and 19.1 mm in thickness<br>
and a steel strip 1920 mm in width and 15.3 mm in thickness<br>
were used in this order as strips, and in both cases, steel<br>
pipes (electric resistance welding pipes) were manufactured<br>
with outer diameter of product pipes being 600 mm.<br>
Test pieces were cut out from weld of the manufactured<br>
electric resistance welding pipes, and subjected to a Charpy<br>
test to evaluate performance of the pipes. Charpy test pieces<br>
were sampled by one for each of ten different points in a pipe<br>
length direction in a manner that a longitudinal direction of<br>
the test piece was parallel to a pipe circumferential direction,<br>
and a longitudinal center of a notch corresponded to a central<br>
position in thickness of the weld. The test pieces were formed<br>
as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test pieces, and subjected to an<br>
impact test at -46°C, and absorbed energy and brittle fracture<br>
surface ratios were measured.<br>
Absorbed energy of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio of 35% or less were specified as an allowable<br><br>
range of performance respectively. The following four kinds<br>
of conditions were used as manufacturing conditions.<br>
As an example of the invention 31, pipes were<br>
manufactured using the pipe manufacturing equipment of Fig.<br>
1. During pipe manufacturing, each corner at the<br>
upper-surface side of the strip was shaped with a round shape<br>
by stone grinding before roll forming, then each corner at the<br>
lower-surface side of the strip (outer-diameter side of the<br>
pipe) was shaped with a round shape by finpass forming. Radius<br>
R of the shaped round shape was made to be 7 mm (37% of strip<br>
thickness of 19.1 mm, and 46% of strip thickness of 15.3 mm) .<br>
When strip thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 15.3<br>
mm, a position of the grinding stone was moved downward by 3.8<br>
mm to be finely adjusted.<br>
As an example of the invention 32, pipes were<br>
manufactured using pipe manufacturing equipment in which a<br>
cutting roll (omitted to be shown) was disposed in place of<br>
the stone grinding means 3 in Fig. 1. During pipe manufacturing,<br>
each corner at the upper-surface side of the strip was shaped<br>
with a round shape by roll cutting using the cutting roll before<br>
roll forming, then each corner at the lower-surface side of<br>
the strip (outer-diameter side of the pipe) was shaped with<br>
a round shape by finpass forming. Radius R of the shaped round<br>
shape was made to be 4 mm (21% of strip thickness of 19.1 mm,<br>
and 26% of strip thickness of 15.3 mm).<br><br>
When strip thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 15.3<br>
mm, a position of the cutting roll was moved downward by 3.8<br>
mm to be finely adjusted.<br>
As a comparative example 3, pipes were manufactured using<br>
pipe manufacturing equipment in which a hole-shape roll for<br>
forming lateral edges (omitted to be shown) was disposed in<br>
place of the stone grinding means 3 in Fig. 1, and fin corners<br>
of the f inpass forming roll 4 were made to be in an approximately<br>
rectangular shape. During pipe manufacturing, each of corners<br>
at both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side<br>
of the strip was shaped with a round shape by hole-shape rolling<br>
using the hole-shape roll for forming lateral edges before roll<br>
forming. Radius R of the shaped round shape was made to be<br>
3 mm (16% of strip thickness of 19.1 mm, and 19% of strip<br>
thickness of 15.3 mm).<br>
When strip thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 15.3<br>
mm, the manufacturing line was temporarily stopped, and the<br>
hole-shape roll was changed from a roll for the strip 19.1 mm<br>
in thickness to a roll for the strip 15.3 mm in thickness.<br>
As a prior art example 3, pipes are manufactured using<br>
pipe manufacturing equipment in which the hole-shape roll for<br>
forming lateral edges was removed from the pipe manufacturing<br>
equipment used in the comparative example 3. Each of corners<br>
at both of the upper-surface side and the lower-surface side<br>
of the strip was still in an approximate rectangle<br><br>
(approximately rectangular shape).<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values (absorbed<br>
energy) and brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the steel<br>
pipes manufactured according to these conditions, and results<br>
of the measurements are shown in Table 3. The table also shows<br>
manufacturing time in each example by a relative ratio of each<br>
manufacturing time to manufacturing time, which is assumed to<br>
be 1, in the comparative example 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
From Table 3, in the examples of the invention 31 and<br>
32, weld has high impact strength and a small brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio, that is, toughness is excellent, and reliability<br>
of products is high. In contrast, in the prior art example<br>
3, weld has low impact strength and a large brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio, that is, toughness is reduced, and reliability<br><br>
of products is low.<br>
Furthermore, in the examples of the invention 31 and 32,<br>
manufacturing time is significantly reduced compared with the<br>
comparative example 3, showing that a product of an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seams can be efficiently manufactured according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 4<br>
Here, electric resistance welding pipes 600 mm in<br>
diameter were manufactured using a strip (steel strip) 1920<br>
mm in width and 19.1 mm in thickness. Then, electric resistance<br>
welding pipes 600 mm in diameter were manufactured using a strip<br>
(steel strip) 1920 mm in width and 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
Then, test pieces were cut out from weld of the<br>
manufactured electric resistance welding pipes, and subjected<br>
to a Charpy test to evaluate performance of the pipes. Charpy<br>
test pieces were sampled by one for each of ten different points<br>
in a pipe length direction in a manner that a longitudinal<br>
direction of the test piece was parallel to a pipe<br>
circumferential direction, and a longitudinal center of a notch<br>
corresponded to a central position in thickness of the weld.<br>
The test pieces were formed as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test<br>
pieces, and subjected to an impact test at -46°C, and absorbed<br>
energy and brittle fracture surface ratios were measured.<br><br>
Absorbed energy of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture surface<br>
ratio of 35% or less were specified as an allowable range of<br>
performance respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 41)<br>
As an example of the invention 41, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
embodiment. In manufacturing, edges at an upper-surface side<br>
of the strip (edges at an inner-surface side of the pipe) were<br>
shaped with approximately straight tapering with the tapering<br>
angle γ of 30° using the hole-shape roll 32 shown in Figs. 8A<br>
and 8B. Then, edges at an lower surface side of the strip<br>
(edges at an outer-surface side of the pipe) were shaped with<br>
approximately straight tapering with the tapering angle a of<br>
30° by finpass forming. When strip thickness was changed from<br>
19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, a position of the hole-shape roll 32 was<br>
moved downward by 7.8 mm to be finely adjusted.<br>
(Comparative example 4)<br>
As a comparative example 4, when the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured, after leveler<br>
working, or before roll forming, both of edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip and edges at a lower-surface<br>
side thereof were concurrently shaped with approximately<br>
straight tapering with the tapering angle of 30° using the usual<br>
hole-shape roll shown in Fig. 4. When strip thickness was<br>
changed from 19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, the manufacturing line was<br><br>
temporarily stopped, and the hole-shape roll was changed from<br>
a roll for the strip 19.1 mm in thickness to a roll for the<br>
strip 11.3 mm in thickness.<br>
(Prior-art example 4)<br>
As a prior-art example 4, when the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured, after leveler<br>
working, or before roll forming, each strip edge was vertically<br>
smoothly ground, then the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
were manufactured via usual roll forming. When strip<br>
thickness was changed from 19.1 mm to 11.3 mm, the manufacturing<br>
line was temporarily stopped, but operation was restarted to<br>
continue manufacturing.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the electric<br>
resistance welding pipes manufactured according to the<br>
examples, and results of the measurements are shown in Table<br>
4. The table 4 also shows a ratio of production efficiency<br>
in each example to production efficiency, which is assumed to<br>
be 1, in the comparative example 4.<br><br><br>
From Table 4, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
according to the example of the invention 41, weld has high<br>
impact strength and a small brittle fracture surface ratio,<br>
that is, toughness is excellent, and reliability of products<br>
is high. In contrast, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
according to the prior art example 4, weld has low impact<br>
strength and a large brittle fracture surface ratio, that is,<br>
toughness is reduced, and reliability of products is low.<br>
Moreover, the example of the invention 41 is significantly<br>
improved in production efficiency compared with the<br>
comparative example 4.<br>
Consequently, it was confirmed that an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seams was able to be efficiently manufactured according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Example 5<br>
Here, electric resistance welding pipes 600 mm in<br><br>
diameter were manufactured using a strip (steel strip) 1920<br>
mm in width and 19.1 mm in thickness.<br>
Then, test pieces were cut out from weld of the<br>
manufactured electric resistance welding pipes, and subjected<br>
to a Charpy test to evaluate performance of the pipes. Charpy<br>
test pieces were sampled by one for each of ten different points<br>
in a pipe length direction in a manner that a longitudinal<br>
direction of the test piece was parallel to a pipe<br>
circumferential direction, and a longitudinal center of a notch<br>
corresponded to a central position in thickness of the weld.<br>
The test pieces were formed as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test<br>
pieces, and subjected to an impact test at -46°C, and absorbed<br>
energy and brittle fracture surface ratios were measured.<br>
Absorbed energy of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture surface<br>
ratio of 35% or less were specified as an allowable range of<br>
performance respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 51)<br>
As an example of the invention 51, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
embodiment. In manufacturing, edges at an upper-surface side<br>
of the strip (edges at an inner-surface side of the pipe) were<br>
shaped with approximately straight tapering with the tapering<br>
angle γ of 30° using the hole-shape roll 32 shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then, edges at an lower-surface side of the strip (edges at<br>
an outer-surface side of the pipe) were shaped with<br><br>
approximately straight tapering with the tapering angle α of<br>
30° by finpass rolling.<br>
(Example of the invention 52)<br>
As an example of the invention 52, the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
embodiment. In manufacturing, edges at an upper-surface side<br>
of the strip (edges at an inner-surface side of the pipe) were<br>
shaped with approximately straight tapering with the tapering<br>
angle γ of 45° using the hole-shape roll 32 shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Then, edges at a lower-surface side of the strip (edges at an<br>
outer-surface side of the pipe) were shaped with approximately<br>
straight tapering with the tapering angle a of 40° by finpass<br>
rolling.<br>
(Comparative example 5)<br>
As a comparative example 5, when the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured, after leveler<br>
working, or before roll forming, both of edges at an<br>
upper-surface side of the strip and edges at a lower-surface<br>
side thereof were concurrently shaped with approximately<br>
straight tapering with the tapering angle of 20° using a cutting<br>
tool, then the electric resistance welding pipes were<br>
manufactured via usual roll forming.<br>
(Prior-art example 5)<br>
As a prior-art example 5, after leveler working, or<br>
before roll forming, each strip edge was vertically smoothly<br><br>
ground, then the electric resistance welding pipes were<br>
manufactured via usual roll forming.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the electric<br>
resistance welding pipes manufactured according to the<br>
examples, and results of the measurements are shown in Table<br>
5.<br><br>
From Table 5, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
according to the examples of the invention 51 and 52, weld has<br>
high impact strength and a small brittle fracture surface ratio,<br>
that is, toughness is excellent, and reliability of products<br>
is high. In contrast, in the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
according to the comparative example 5 and the prior art example<br>
5, weld has low impact strength and a large brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio, that is, toughness is reduced, and reliability<br>
of products is low.<br>
Thus, it was confirmed that an electric resistance<br><br>
welding pipe having excellent characterization of welded seams<br>
was able to be manufactured according to the invention.<br>

example 6, and prior-art example 6 respectively.<br>
Then, test pieces were cut out from weld of the<br>
manufactured electric resistance welding pipes, and subjected<br>
to a Charpy test to evaluate performance of the pipes. Charpy<br>
test pieces were sampled by one for each of ten different points<br>
in a pipe length direction in a manner that a longitudinal<br>
direction of the test piece was parallel to a pipe<br>
circumferential direction, and a longitudinal center of a notch<br>
corresponded to a central position in thickness of the weld.<br>
The test pieces were formed as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test<br>
pieces, and subjected to an impact test at -46°C, and absorbed<br>
energy and brittle fracture surface ratios were measured.<br>
Absorbed energy of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture surface<br>
ratio of 35% or less were specified as an allowable range of<br>
performance respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 61)<br>
As an example of the invention 61, the above electric<br><br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured according to the<br>
embodiment. In manufacturing, after leveler working, or<br>
before roll forming, edges at an upper-surface side of the strip<br>
(edges at an inner-surface side of the pipe) were cut using<br>
a cutting tool (cutting roll) having cutting blades disposed<br>
in a roll shape so as to be shaped with approximately straight<br>
tapering with a tapering angle of 30° and tapering height of<br>
70% of strip thickness. Then, edges at an outer-surface side<br>
of the pipe (edges at a lower-surface side of the strip) were<br>
shaped with approximately straight tapering with a tapering<br>
angle of 30° and tapering height of 30% of strip thickness by<br>
a second stand in two-stand finpass forming.<br>
(Example of the invention 62)<br>

(edges at an inner-surface side of the pipe) were cut using<br>
a roll-shape grinding stone so as to be shaped with<br>
approximately straight tapering with a tapering angle of 40°<br>
and tapering height of 85% of strip thickness. Then, edges<br>
at an outer-surface side of the pipe (edges at a lower-surface<br>

thereby shaped with approximately straight tapering with a<br>
tapering angle of 20° and tapering height of 40% of strip<br>
thickness. Then, forming was performed using a three-stand<br>
finpass stand having a fin with usual one-stage tapering.<br>
(Prior-art example 6)<br>
As a prior-art example 6, when the above electric<br>
resistance welding pipes were manufactured, after leveler<br>
working, or before roll forming, each strip edge was vertically<br>
smoothly ground, then the electric resistance welding pipes<br>
were manufactured via usual roll forming.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of weld of the electric<br>
resistance welding . pipes manufactured according to the<br>
examples, and results of the measurements are shown in Table<br>

height to 10% or less of strip thickness after finpass forming<br>
and immediately before electric resistance welding, that is,<br>
the tapering height was significantly decreased through<br><br>
finpass forming.<br>
