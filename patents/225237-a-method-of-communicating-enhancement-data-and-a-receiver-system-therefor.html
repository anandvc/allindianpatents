				<td>A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING ENHANCEMENT DATA<br>
AND A RECEIVER SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
Background<br>
The invention relates to a method of communicating enhancement data and a<br>
receiver system therefor, and particularly to communicating enhancement data<br>
associated with audio/video content in multiple layers.<br>
Ancillary information, such as program sub-titles, emergency messages, closed<br>
caption messages, and program guide information, may be transmitted along with regular<br>
television content. More recently, other types of ancillary information that may be sent with<br>
television content include enhancement data such as web pages, multimedia information, or<br>
other digital data files. Ancillary information may be sent in the vertical blanking interval<br>
(VBI) of an analog television broadcast signal or sent with digital television content over a<br>
digital transmission transport medium.<br>
Various standards exist that provide for transmission of ancillary information along<br>
with television content. One standard is the Advanced Television Enhancement Forum<br>
(ATVEF) Specification, Draft Version 1 .Ir26, dated February 2,1999. The ATVEF<br>
specification is designed to provide for transmission of enhancement data along with<br>
television content in both analog and digital systems, such as cable systems, satellite systems,<br>
terrestrial systems, and so forth.<br>
The amount of enhancement data or other types of ancillary information that can be<br>
received by a receiving platform depends largely on its capabilities (including storage,<br>
processing, and data transfer rate capabilities, for example). Different receiving platforms<br>
may have different capabilities. For example, some relatively low-capacity receiving<br>
platforms such as earlier version set-top boxes may have a relatively low bandwidth for<br>
receiving ancillary information. To ensure receipt of ancillary information by as large an<br>
audience as possible, content creators may reduce the amount of ancillary information in a<br>
transmission to target such low-capacity receiver platforms. The assumption may be that<br>
such platforms are being used by the greatest number of viewers. Thus, the quality of, and<br>
features available in, enhancement data or other types of ancillary information may be limited<br>
to accommodate the relatively low-capacity receiving platforms. This may limit options that<br>
may be offered the audience.<br>
Summary<br>
In general, according to one embodiment, a method for communicating enhancement<br>
data associated with audio/video content includes receiving, in a receiver system,<br>
enhancement data. The enhancement data is associated with a plurality of alternatives each<br>
including one or more layers of enhancement data. One of the alternatives is selected based<br>
on the capacity of the receiver system, and the one or more layers associated with the selected<br>
alternative are received.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
communicating enhancement data, said method comprising the steps<br>
of : detecting a first and second announcements in a receiver platform<br>
; examining alternatives presented in the second announcement, the<br>
alternatives containing different amounts of enhancement data ;<br>
selecting one of the alternatives in the second announcement based<br>
on the capacity of the second receiver platform ; and receiving data<br>
corresponding to the selected alternative.<br>
The present invention also provides a receiver system for<br>
communicating enhancement data, said receiver comprising : a<br>
receive module to receive first and second announcements having<br>
alternatives ; a controller to select one of the alternatives based on<br>
the capacity of the receiver.<br>
Other features and embodiments will become apparent from the following description<br>
and from the claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide an<br>
understanding of the present invention. However, it is to be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details and that numerous<br>
variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible. For example,<br>
although reference is made to a version of the Advanced Television Enhancement Forum<br>
(ATVEF) Specification, Draft Version 1.1r26, dated February 2, 1999, it is contemplated that<br>
other versions of the ATVEF Specification or other standards and techniques for transmission<br>
of ancillary information with content that includes audio data or video data (e.g., television<br>
content) may be included in further embodiments.<br>
As used in this description, the term audio/video (A/V) content is intended to include<br>
any type of audio and/or video data that may be transmitted or distributed to one or more<br>
receiving sites for presentation to viewers and/or listeners. An example of A/V content is<br>
television content. As used here, A/V content may refer to content that may include both an<br>
audio and video portion or one of an audio and video portion.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, an information delivery system 10 according to one embodiment<br>
includes a content creator 12, a transport operator system 14, and a plurality of receivers 16.<br>
The receivers 16 may be located at various receiving sites, including homes, offices,<br>
entertainment facilities, or other locations. The content creator 12 originates enhancement<br>
data (or other types of ancillary information) and television content (or other types of content<br>
including A/V content) communicated to the transport operator system 14 over link 24.<br>
Enhancement data may include graphics (e.g., web pages, multimedia information, or other<br>
digital data files), presentation layout, and synchronization information. The combination of<br>
the enhancement data and A/V content may be referred to as enhanced A/V content. Other<br>
types of ancillary information may include program sub-titles, closed caption messages,<br>
emergency messages, and program guide information.<br>
The transport operator system 14 provides an enhanced A/V content delivery<br>
infrastructure that may include terrestrial, cable, satellite, or other types of transmission<br>
facilities (either analog or digital). The A/V content and enhancement data may be<br>
transmitted over a transport medium 22, which may be a terrestrial, cable, satellite, or other<br>
type of link, to the receivers 16. Fig. 1 illustrates the transport medium 22 as satellite link.<br>
The receivers 16 may include televisions, set-top boxes, personal computers, or other types of<br>
systems adapted to receive A/V content and associated enhancement data or other types of<br>
ancillary information. In further embodiments, the receivers 16 may also include distribution<br>
systems such as geographic regional centers that receive enhanced A/V content for<br>
distribution in a predefined geographic region.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments, the content creator 12 is capable of creating<br>
different layers of enhancement data for transmission to the multiple receivers 16, which may<br>
be of various types with different capabilities for receiving enhancement data. For example,<br>
the storage capacity, processing speed, and data transfer rates in the receivers 16 may vary.<br>
In addition to the receivers 16, other receiver platforms may also be coupled to the transport<br>
medium 22 to receive enhanced A/V content.<br>
According to one embodiment, a receiver platform can selectively receive one or<br>
more layers of enhancement data, depending on its capabilities. Enhancement data may be<br>
associated with several alternatives, with each alternative including different numbers of<br>
layers. Thus, a relatively low-capacity receiver platform can choose to receive an alternative<br>
with a smaller number of layers, while a relatively high-capacity receiver platform can<br>
choose to receive an alternative with more layers to present more enhancement features to a<br>
viewer. Thus, a first alternative may include a first set of enhancement data, a second<br>
alternative may include a second set of enhancement data that includes the first set in addition<br>
to further data, a third alternative may include a third set of enhancement data that includes<br>
other sources of enhancement data, and so forth.<br>
The multiple layers of enhancement data may be transmitted in a stream over the<br>
transport medium 22 by the transport operator system 14, with different receiver platforms<br>
capable of selecting different combinations of layers by choosing one of multiple alternatives<br>
of the enhancement data. With some embodiments of the invention, the layers of<br>
enhancement data do not need to be retransmitted as many times as there are alternatives.<br>
Thus, the layers of enhancement data may be transmitted in one stream with different<br>
receivers picking and choosing the layers to receive based on the desired alternative.<br>
Consequently, bandwidth on the transport medium 22 is not consumed by having to transmit<br>
different groups of enhancement data associated with different alternatives in separate<br>
transmissions.<br>
Enhancement data according to the ATVEF Specification may include enhancements,<br>
with each enhancement including three components: an announcement, a resource, and a<br>
trigger. An ATVEF announcement indicates that enhancement data is being transmitted, a<br>
resource includes a file that contains the content of the enhancement data, and a trigger<br>
synchronizes the enhancement data with the A/V content transmission. An announcement<br>
may describe the location of both the resource stream and the trigger stream.<br>
For each A/V channel (e.g., a TV channel), one or more enhancements may be offered<br>
as choices presented to the user, who can select which of the enhancements, if any, to view.<br>
In addition, each enhancement may have multiple alternatives (e.g., alternatives according to<br>
different languages). The ATVEF Specification may utilize a multicast protocol (e.g., IP<br>
multicast) to transmit the announcements, resource files, and triggers associated with the<br>
offered enhancements. IP is described in Request for Comment (RFC) 791, entitled "Internet<br>
Protocol," dated September 1981. An IP multicast protocol is described in RFC 1301,<br>
entitled "Multicast Transport Protocol," dated February 1992. RFCs may be available at the<br>
web site {http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html}. In addition, a one-way IP multicast transmission<br>
protocol (e.g., the Unidirectional Hypertext Transfer Protocol or UHTTP, described in the<br>
ATVEF Specification) may be used to deliver resource data.<br>
Conventionally, ATVEF announcements arrive at a predetermined IP address and<br>
port. In the announcements, the locations of the resource and trigger streams specified in the<br>
ATVEF Specification may be described as IP addresses and ports where the resource files<br>
and trigger files may be found. The ATVEF announcement may be a Session Description<br>
Protocol (SDP) announcement, as described in RFC 2327, entitled "SDP: Session<br>
Description Protocol," dated April 1998.<br>
Each ATVEF announcement is for a different enhancement, which may be an ATVEF<br>
presentation or application (e.g., a program or script). Examples may include a financial<br>
application, a sports application, advertising program, enhancement related directly to a TV<br>
show, and other presentations or application. In addition to locations of resource and trigger<br>
files, other information that may be included in an announcement are set forth below. Each<br>
announcement may include an identifier, such as a universally unique identifier (UUED), to<br>
identify the associated enhancement. A field in the announcement may indicate the<br>
bandwidth of the transmitted enhancement data, which may be expressed in kilobits per<br>
second (kbps). Another field may indicate an estimate of the cache storage that may be<br>
needed during playing of the enhancement. The bandwidth and cache storage fields may be<br>
used by a receiver platform to adequately judge whether or not it can successfully play an<br>
enhancement from beginning to end. Other fields that may be present in the announcement<br>
may include an identification of the language in which the enhancement data will be<br>
presented, start and stop times of the enhancement, and other types of information. The<br>
announcement may be separated into multiple sections to correspond to multiple alternatives<br>
of an enhancement. If the announcement is in the SDP format, then the multiple sections<br>
may be media sections.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, each of the alternatives may<br>
be identified with one or more sections, with each section referring to a source of resource<br>
data or trigger file. In such an embodiment, each source may correspond to a layer of<br>
enhancement data. Thus, for example, a first layer may include a source located at a first<br>
address, a second layer may include a source located at a second address, and so forth. Each<br>
of the alternatives in the announcement may refer to multiple layers of such data. Thus, for<br>
example, a first alternative may refer to a source at a first address, a second alternative may<br>
refer to a source at the first address and another source at a second address, and so forth. A<br>
receiver platform can choose one of the alternatives identified in an announcement based on<br>
the capacity of the receiver platform (e.g., its storage capacity, processing speed, data transfer<br>
rate, and so forth).<br>
If protocols other than the ATVEF Specification is used in further embodiments, then<br>
announcements may refer to any indications provided by such other protocols of the presence<br>
of ancillary information. In addition, such other protocols may provide for files or packets<br>
that contain contents of the ancillary information and timing or synchronization information.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, components in the content creator 12 and a receiver platform<br>
(such as a receiver 16) are illustrated. The content creator 12 may include a transmitting port<br>
102 to transmit data from the content creator 12 over the link 24 to the transport operator<br>
system 14. The received enhancement data may be processed by the transport operator<br>
system 14 for transmission to one or more receiver platforms. In the content creator 12, an<br>
enhancement data create routine 108 executable on a controller 106 is capable of creating<br>
enhancement data in layers according to some embodiments. The create routine 108 may<br>
initially be stored in a storage medium 104 and loaded by the controller 106 for execution. A<br>
user interface module 105 (comprising software and/or hardware components) may allow one<br>
or more operators or developers to enter requirements from which the layers of enhancement<br>
data are created.<br>
In the receiver platform (e.g., receiver 16), a receiver module 114 is coupled to the<br>
transport medium 22. Data communicated to the transport medium 22 passes through the<br>
receiver module 114. Data received from the transport medium 22 passes through the<br>
receiver module 114 to a receive device driver 118 in the receiver platform. The receive<br>
device driver 118 may be capable of separating A/V content, which is passed to an A/V<br>
routine or application 116 to process the A/V content for presentation or distribution. The<br>
receive device driver 118 passes enhancement data to an enhancement processing routine<br>
120. Thus, a stream received over the transport medium 22 is separated into A/V content and<br>
enhancement data, with the enhancement data sent to the enhancement processing routine<br>
120 for further manipulation.<br>
Software in the receiver platform, including the device drivers 118 and 120, the<br>
enhancement processing routine 120, and the A/V routine 116, are executable on a controller<br>
122, which may be a microprocessor, a microcontroller, or other suitable control device. A<br>
memory 124 is coupled to the controller 122. Another storage device 126 (which may be, by<br>
way of example, a mass storage device such as a hard disk drive) may also be accessible by<br>
the controller 122. A file 140 containing information describing the capacity (e.g., available<br>
storage capacity, processing speed, transfer speed, etc.) of the receiving platform may be<br>
stored in the storage device 126. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the<br>
enhancement processing routine 120 is capable of examining announcements received<br>
through the receiver module 114 and receive device driver 118 to determine available<br>
alternatives associated with each enhancement. Based on the presented alternatives, the<br>
enhancement processing routine 120 can select one of the alternatives to receive.<br>
In addition to the categories of the information listed above, an ATVEF<br>
announcement may also include a predetermined string, e.g., "a=type:tve", to identify itself<br>
as an announcement. For backward compatibility, a first type announcement according to<br>
conventional ATVEF systems may include the predetermined string. Although a first type<br>
announcement according to conventional ATVEF systems can specify multiple alternatives<br>
of an enhancement, layering of resource files in accordance with one embodiment is not<br>
provided. According to conventional ATVEF systems, a new alternative is defined each time<br>
a new source of data is referred to in an announcement.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a second type announcement<br>
can be sent along with the first type announcement, with the second type announcement<br>
being capable of identifying multiple alternatives each capable of being associated with one<br>
or more layers (or sources) of resource data. The second type announcement may be sent<br>
without the predetermined string, e.g., "a=type:tve". Instead, the second type announcement<br>
may include another predetermined string, e.g., "a=type:x2tve" to identify that a new type of<br>
announcement has been received. A receiver platform that is capable of receiving the new<br>
type of announcement may be programmed to ignore first type announcements (those<br>
containing the string "a=type:tve", for example) having the same ATVEF enhancement<br>
identifier, UUED, as a corresponding second type announcement.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, an example information delivery system 10 includes a relatively<br>
low-capacity receiver 16A and a relatively high-capacity receiver 16B. It is contemplated<br><br>
that additional receiver platforms with further varying capacities may also be included. In the<br>
illustrated example, two alternatives are presented, as identified by strings "tve-alt:l" and<br>
"tve-alt:2". In this embodiment, an Nth alternative may be identified with the string "tve-<br>
alt:N". As illustrated, an announcement 350 (of the second type) includes multiple sections<br>
300, 302, 304, 306, 308, and 310. The section 310 may include general information, such as<br>
the identifier UUID of the enhancement and the second type of predetermined string, e.g.,<br>
"a=type:x2tve" to identify that the received announcement is of the second type. The<br>
sections 300, 302, 304, 306 and 308 may be media sections according to the SDP format, for<br>
example.<br>
Each of the sections 300-308 points to one source of enhancement data (resource or<br>
trigger files) and can be associated with one of the multiple alternatives of the enhancement<br>
corresponding to the announcement 350. The section 300 identifies a trigger file located at<br>
address Al and is associated with a first alternative as indicated by tve-alt:l. The section 300<br>
can also indicate that the bandwidth associated with the trigger file is 1 kbps. The section<br>
302 refers to resource files located at address A2 and is associated with the first alternative,<br>
as indicated by tve-alt: 1. In addition, the section 302 also indicates that the bandwidth for<br>
receiving the resource files at address A2 is 10 kbps and the cache requirement is 100<br>
kilobytes (kB). Bandwidth refers to the speed of data transfer that is needed to adequately<br>
receive and process the data. Cache requirement refers to the amount of storage that may be<br>
needed to store the enhancement data during presentation in a receiver platform. The<br>
bandwidth and cache storage requirements may be referred to as capacity requirements for<br>
receipt and processing of the enhancement data. Other types of capacity requirements may<br>
be included in further embodiments.<br>
Sections 304, 306 and 308 are associated with the second alternative (as identified by<br>
tve-alt:2). The section 304 refers to a trigger file at address A3 (with a bandwidth of 1 kbps),<br>
the section 306 identifies resource files at address A2 (with a bandwidth of 10 kbps and cache<br>
requirement of 100 kB), and the section 308 refers to resource files at address A4 (with a<br>
bandwidth of 1000 kbps and cache requirement of 5000 kB). In the illustrated example, the<br>
section 306 associated with the second alternative refers to the same source (located at<br>
address A2) of resource files as the section 302 associated with the first alternative. In<br>
addition, the second alternative includes a second layer of resource files from the source at<br>
address A4.<br>
The enhancement processing routine 120 in the receiver 16A (which may be a<br>
relatively low capacity receiver) examines the announcement 350 to determine which<br>
alternative to select. If the receiver 16A is unable to handle the requirements of the second<br>
alternative, then it selects the first alternative by receiving the stream on address A1 (the<br>
trigger of the first alternative) and the stream on address A2 (resource files associated with<br>
the first alternative). Another receiver 16B examines its received copy of the announcement<br>
350 to determine which alternative to select. If the receiver 16B is capable of handling the<br>
second alternative, then it may choose to receive the trigger from the stream on address A3<br>
and resource files from the streams on addresses A2 and A4. Additional alternatives may be<br>
presented in the announcement 350. In the illustrated example, the low-capacity receiver<br>
16A may be a TV, while the high-capacity receiver 16B may include a personal computer.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the tasks performed by the enhancement processing routine 120 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the invention is described. The enhancement processing<br>
routine 120 determines if enhancement data has been received (at 402). This may be<br>
performed by determining if announcements have been received which may be packets<br>
containing predetermined string "a=type:tve" or "a=type:x2tve". If so, the routine 120<br>
determines if one or more second type announcements have been received (at 404), e.g.,<br>
announcements with the string "a=type:x2tve". If not, then first type announcements, e.g.,<br>
those with the string "a=type:tve", are processed (at 414) according to conventional ATVEF<br>
techniques. If a second type announcement has been received, then any first type<br>
announcement having the same enhancement identifier (UUED) is ignored (at 406) by the<br>
routine 120. Next, the routine 120 examines (at 408) alternatives presented in the second<br>
type announcement. Based on the information contained in the sections associated with the<br>
different alternatives, the routine 120 selects (at 410) one of the alternatives based on the<br>
capacity of the receiving platform, as determined from the capacity information file 140 (Fig.<br>
2), for example. The capacity information file 140 may contain information identifying the<br>
capabilities of the receiver platform, which may be compared by the processing routine 120<br>
to the bandwidth and cache requirements presented in the second type announcement 350.<br>
Next, the routine 120 receives (at 412) the streams at the indicated addresses that are<br>
associated with the selected alternatives.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, an enhancement data creation process performed by the<br>
enhancement data create routine 108 in the content creator 12 is illustrated. Based on desired<br>
enhancement programming, which may be specified by operators through the user interface<br>
module 105 and stored in the storage device 104, the create routine 108 creates (at 502) the<br>
layers of enhancement data. As discussed above, each layer may be associated with a<br>
different source of resource and trigger files. Next, the create routine 108 creates (at 504) one<br>
or more announcements corresponding to the enhancements being transmitted. Each<br>
announcement may include multiple sections to identify multiple alternatives and associated<br>
sources of files. The announcement also includes information identifying capacity<br>
requirements including bandwidth information and cache storage information. The<br>
announcements are transmitted (at 506) by the content creator 12 of the transport operator<br>
system 14 for distribution.<br>
Some embodiments, of the invention may have one or more of the following<br>
advantages. For higher capacity receivers, higher quality enhancement data may be received<br>
from a stream, while alternative enhancement data having reduced features may be received<br>
by lower capacity receivers from the same stream. By layering the enhancement data, a<br>
wider audience may be reached without sacrificing the features and options that may be<br>
presented to higher capacity receiver platforms.<br>
Various software (formed of modules, routines, or other layers, for example) may be<br>
stored or otherwise tangibly embodied in one or more machine-routable storage media in<br>
devices of the information delivery system. Storage media suitable for tangibly embodying<br>
software instructions may include different forms of memory including semiconductor<br>
memory devices such as dynamic or static random access memories, erasable and<br>
programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable read-<br>
only memories (EEPROMs), and flash memories; magnetic disks such as fixed, floppy and<br>
removable disks; other magnetic media including tape; and optical media such as CD<br>
(compact disc) or DVD (digital video disc) disks. The instructions stored in the one or more<br>
storage media when executed cause devices in the information delivery system to perform<br>
programmed acts.<br>
The software can be loaded into devices in the information delivery system in one of<br>
many different ways. For example, instructions or other code segments stored on one or<br>
more storage media or transported through a network interface card, modem or other<br>
interface mechanism may be loaded into the system and executed to perform programmed<br>
acts. In the loading or transport process, data signals that are embodied as carrier waves are<br>
transmitted over telephones, network lines, wireless links, cables, and the like, may<br>
communicate the instructions or code segments to devices in the information delivery system.<br>
While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations<br>
therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and variations<br>
as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

announcement.<br>
6. The receiver system as claimed in claim 3, wherein each<br>
alternative of enhancement data comprises information identifying<br>
one or more capacity requirements.<br>
7. The receiver system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the one or<br>
more capacity requirements comprises a storage capacity<br>
requirement.<br>
8. The receiver system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the one or<br>
more capacity requirements comprises a bandwidth requirement.<br>
9. The receiver system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the<br>
enhancement data is according to an Advanced Television<br>
Enhancement Forum Specification.<br>
10. A method of communicating enhancement data, substantially as<br>
herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
11. A receiver system for communicating enhancement data,<br>
substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to and as<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
A system includes a content creator (12), a transmitting<br>
source(14), and a receiver platform (16) for communicating<br>
enhancement data associated with audio/video content according<br>
to a protocol without layering capability. A receiver platform (16)<br>
detects for a first announcement and a second announcement<br>
(402), the first announcement being associated with non-layered<br>
enhancement data, and the second announcement being<br>
associated with layered enhancement data having a plurality of<br>
layers. Each layer comprises one or more sources of trigger files<br>
or one or more sources of resource files. Alternatives presented<br>
in the second announcement are examined (408), the alternatives<br>
containing different collections of the layers of enhancement<br>
data. One of the alternatives in the second announcement is<br>
selected (410) based on the capacity of the second receiver<br>
platform. One or more layers containing respective trigger files<br>
and resource files associated with the selected alternative are<br>
received (412). The enhancement data may comprise<br>
enhancement data according to an Advanced Television<br>
Enhancement Forum Specification.</td>
