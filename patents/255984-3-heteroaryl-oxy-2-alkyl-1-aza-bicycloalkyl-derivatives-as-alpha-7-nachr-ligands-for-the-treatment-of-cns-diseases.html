The following considerations apply to the individual reaction steps described above:<br>
a)	One or more functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, may<br>
need to be protected in the starting materials by protecting groups. The protecting groups<br>
employed may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups<br>
concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications,<br>
esterifications, oxidations, solvoiysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting<br>
groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to<br>
removal, typically by solvoiysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example<br>
under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the<br>
end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are<br>
suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter. The protection of such<br>
functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their<br>
removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W.<br>

carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
b)	Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice-<br>
versa. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used. Suitable acid addition salts<br>
for use in accordance with the present invention include for example the hydrochloride.<br>
c)	Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their<br>
corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods.<br>
Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by<br>
means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of dia-stereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used.<br>
d)	Suitable diluents for carrying out the above- described are especially inert organic<br>
solvents. These include, in particular, aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic, optionally halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons, such as, for example, benzine, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene,<br>
dichlorobenzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane. dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran orethylene glycol dimethyl ether or ethylene glycol diethyl ether; ketones,<br>
such as acetone, butanone or methyl isobutyl ketone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile<br>
propionitrile or butyronitrile; amides, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-formanilide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoric<br>
triamide; esters, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, sulphoxides, such as dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n- or i-propanol, ethylene glycol<br>
rnonomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethyelene glycol monomethyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol monoethyl ether. Further, mixtures of diluents may be employed.<br>
Depending on the starting materials, reaction conditions and auxiliaries, water or diluents<br>
constaining water may be suitable. It is also possible to use one a starting material as diluent<br>
simultaneously.<br>
e)	Reaction temperatures can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the<br>
processes are carried out at temperatures between 0°C and 150°C, preferably between<br>
10°C and 120°C. Deprotonation reactions can be varied within a relatively wide range. In<br>
general, the processes are carried out at temperatures between -150°C and +50°C,<br>
preferably between -75°C and 0°C.<br>
f)	The reactions are generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, it is also<br>
possible to carry out the processes according to the invention under elevated or reduced<br>
pressure - in general between 0.1 bar and 10 bar.<br><br>
g) Starting materials are generally employed in approximately equimolar amounts. However, it is also possible to use a relatively large excess of one of the components. The reaction is generally carried out in a suitable diluent in the presence of a reaction auxiliary, and the reaction mixture is generally stirred at the required temperature for a number of hours.<br>
h) Working up the reaction mixtures according to the above processes and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures (cf. the Preparation Examples).<br>

More particularly the agents of the invention are useful as markers for labeling the alpha? nAChR receptors in vitro or in vivo. In particular, compounds of the invention which are properly isotopically labeled are useful as PET markers. Such PET markers are labeled with one or more atoms selected from the group consisting of 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F.<br>
The agents of the invention are therefore useful, for instance, for determining the levels of receptor occupancy of a drug acting at the nAChR, or diagnostic purposes for diseases resulting from an imbalance or dysfunction of nAChR, and for monitoring the effectiveness of pharmacotherapies of such diseases.<br>
In accordance with the above, the present invention provides an agent of the invention for use as a marker for neuroimaging.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a composition for labeling brain and peripheral nervous system structures involving riAChR/n vivo and in vitro comprising an agent of the invention.<br>
In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for labeling brain and peripheral nervous system structures involving nAChR/n vitro or in vivo, which comprises contacting brain tissue with an agent of the invention.<br>
The method of the invention may comprise a further step aimed at determining whether the agent of the invention labeled the target structure. Said further step may be effected by observing the target structure using positron emission tomography TPET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or any device allowing detection of radioactive radiations.<br>
In particular, the agents of the invention are u7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a.7 nAChR) agonists.<br>
In functional assays, the agents of the invention display high affinity at the a7 nAChR as shown in the following tests:<br>
a) A functional assay for affinity at the u7 nAChR is carried out with a rat pituitary cell line stably expressing the cx7 nAChR . Briefly, GH3 cells recombinantly expressing the nAChR a7 were seeded 72 h prior to the experiment on black 96-well plates and incubated at 37CC in a humidified atmosphere (5 % CO2/95 % air). On the day of the experiment medium was removed by flicking the plates and replaced with 100 /vl growth medium containing af fluorescent calcium sensitve dye, in the presence of 2.5 mM probenicid (Sigma). The cells<br>
were incubated at 37"C in a humidified atmosphere (5 % CO2/95 % air) for 1 h. Plates were flicked to remove excess of Fluo-4, washed twice with Hepes-buffered salt solution (in mM: NaCI 130, KCI 5.4, CaCI2 2, MgSO4 0.8, NaH2P04 0.9, glucose 25, Hepes 20, pH 7.4; HBS) and refilled with 100/L/l of HBS containing antagonists when appropriate. The incubation in the presence of the antagonist lasted between 3 and 5 minutes. Plates were then placed into an imaging plate reader and fluorescence signal recordedd In this assay, compounds of the invention exhibit pEC50 values of about 5 to about 9. Partial and potent agonists in this test are preferred.<br>
b)	To assess the antagonist activity of the compounds of the invention on the human<br>
neuronal nAChR a4p2, a similar functional assay is carried out using a human epithelial cell<br>
line stably expressing the human a4|i2 subtype (Michelmore et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's<br>
Arch. Pharmacol. (2002) 366, 235) In this assay, the preferred compounds of the invention<br>
show selectivity for the a7 nAChR subtypes.<br>
c)	To assess the antagonist activity of the compounds of the invention on the "ganglionic<br>
subtype" (u3|}4), the muscle type of nicotinic receptor (a1p1y6) and the 5-HT3 receptor,<br>
similar functional tests as just described under a) are carried out with a human epithelial cell<br>
line stably expressing the human ganglionic subtype, a cell line endogenously expressing the<br>
human muscle type of nicotinic receptors or a cell line endogenously expressing the murine<br>
5-HT, receptor (Michelmore et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (2002) 366,<br>
235 Compounds which display little or no activity on the a3(H nAChR, the muscle subtype<br>
of nicotinic receptor as well as the5-HT3 receptor are especially preferred.<br>
In the model of mice showing sensory gating deficit (DBA/2-mice) described by S. Leonard et al. in Schizophrenia Bulletin 22, 431-445 (1996), the compounds of the invention induce significant sensory gating at concentrations of about 10 to about 40 jaM.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be shown to increase attention in a test of attention for rodents (Robbins, J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. (2001) 13, 326-35), namely the 5-choice serial reaction time test (5-CSRTT). In this test, the rat must observe a wall containing 5 holes. When a light flash appears in one of them, the rat must respond with a<br>
nose-poke into the correct hole within 5 sec. in order to receive a food pellet reward, delivered to a feeder in the opposite wall.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also show learning/memory enhancing effects in the social recognition test in mice and rats (Ennaceur and Delacour, Behav. Brain Res. (1988) 31, 47-59).<br>
The compounds of the invention are therefore useful for the prevention and treatment (including mitigation and prevention) of various disorders, especially those mentioned above. The usefulness of ct7 nAChR agonists in neurodegeneration is documented in the literature, e.g. in Wang et al., J. Bioi. Chem. 275, 5626-5632 (2000).<br>
For the treatment of the above and other disorders, the appropriate dosage of a compound (active ingredient) of the invention will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated as well as the relative potency of the particular agent of the invention employed. For example, the amount of active agent required may be determined on the basis of known in vitro and in vivo techniques, determining how long a particular active agent concentration in the blood plasma remains at an acceptable level fora therapeutic effect. In general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at daily dosages of from about 0.01 to about 30.0 mg/kg p.o. In humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 0.7 to about 1400 mg/day p.o., e.g. from about 50 to 200 mg (70 kg man), conveniently administered once or in divided doses up to 4 x per day or in sustained release form. Oral dosage forms accordingly suitably comprise from about 1.75 or 2.0 to about 700 or 1400 mg of a compound of the invention admixed with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions contain, for example, from about 0.1 % to about 99.9 %, preferably from about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredient(s).<br>
Examples for compositions comprising a compound of the invention include, for example, a solid dispersion, an aqueous solution, e.g. containing a solubilising agent, a microemulsion and a suspension of, e.g. a salt of a compound of formula I or a free compound of the formula I in the range of from 0.1 to 1 %, e.g. 0.5 %. The composition may be buffered to a pH in the range of, e.g. from 3.5 to 9.5, e.g. to pH 4.5, by a suitable buffer.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also commercially useful as research chemicals.<br>
For use according to the invention, a compound of the formula I and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be administered as single active agent or in combination with one or more other active agents of the formula I and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or especially other active agents commonly employed especially for the treatment of the disorders mentioned herein or further other disorders, in any customary manner, e.g. orally, for example in the form of tablets, capsules, or as nasal spray, or parenterally, for example in the form of injection solutions or suspensions.

The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding<br>
content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In the case of a combination, the pharmaceutical compositions for separate administration of the combination partners and/or those for administration in a fixed combination, i.e. a single galenical composition comprising at least two combination partners, according to the invent-tion can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals, including man, comprising a the-rapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active combination partner alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. When the combination partners employed are applied in the form as marketed as single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, or furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of a combination partner contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can instead with a single dosage unit also be reached by administration of a two or more dosage units.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the combination partners may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately (e.g. sequentially after fixed or variable periods of time), or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment (including mitigation) of a disorder according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the combination partner (a) (a compound of the present invention) in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of a combination partner (b) (e.g. a different compound of the present invent-<br>
tion or an active ingredient of a different formula) in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual combination partners can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term "administering" also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of a combination partner that convert in vivo to the combination partner as such. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous and/ or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The effective dosage of the combination partners employed may vary, for example depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the disorder being treated, and/or the severity of the disorder being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration, metabolism by and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skili can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, mitigate, counter or arrest the disorder Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites.<br>
