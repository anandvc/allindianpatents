				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to weld surfacing of a material with similar /<br>
dissimilar material in the form of powders, using the heat generated by friction<br>
between surfaces in relative motion under pressure. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to an improved friction surfacing method including a<br>
tool to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder material.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Surfacing is a welding technique applied to industrial components operating in<br>
service conditions involving corrosive medium or various kinds of wear<br>
mechanisms or their combinations. Depending on the intensity and severity of<br>
the service environments, the operating surfaces are deposited with suitable<br>
materials to provide adequate service life to the component. The thickness of<br>
deposit depends upon the service, requirements.<br>
Weld surfacing is a technology widely used for the manufacture of new<br>
components including the repair and reclamation of serviced components. For<br>
the purpose, several types of welding and spraying techniques are employed.<br>
Several fusion welding techniques based on arc and/or gas flame are generally<br>
preferred due to the associated lower cost and ease of application. However, the<br>
arc welding techniques result in relatively thicker weld deposits and often require<br>
multi-layer deposits due to the higher level of dilution as consequent upon high-<br>
energy dissipation. This leads to higher consumption of welding consumables to<br>
achieve the required deposit surface properties. Spraying techniques are suitable<br>
for thinner surfaced layers. However while fusion welding produces strong<br>
metallurgical bonds, arc and gas based spraying techniques using powder<br>
material for creating the coated surface produce generally a mechanical bond<br>
1<br><br><br>
between the surfaced layer and the substrate. Hence, the surfaced layer may<br>
get disbonded with the impact loading.<br>
Patent No. EP0474455 discloses a process for surfacing of materials using<br>
frictional heat generated by moving surfaces in contact under pressure. The<br>
process involves the use of a rotating consumable in the form of a rod. The rod<br>
is pressed against the material to be surfaced raising the temperature of the rod<br>
material and / or the base metal to their plastic temperature. As the rotating<br>
tool moves in a linear direction, the plasticised material of the tool is transferred<br>
to the member being surfaced and forms a deposited layer.<br>
Patent No. U52005000424 describes a method for the formation of a deposit of<br>
special characteristics using high velocity hot gas and powder filler material. The<br>
powder particles heated to high temperature by the high velocity hot gas<br>
impinge on the surface of the material on which the deposit is being created.<br>
The impinging particles are mechanically locked on to the surface and between<br>
themselves, resulting on a surface deposited layer.<br>
All the prior art methods however entails defects like porosity in the weld<br>
deposit, material loss, lack of proper bonding, improper thickness and bead<br>
appearance. Further, such processes require costly and Intricate equipment.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to propose an improved friction surfacing method<br>
to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder material which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
2<br><br><br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved friction surfacing<br>
method to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder material which<br>
makes use of powder fillers to produce thin layers of deposits.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved friction surfacing<br>
method to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder material which<br>
is capable of producing a thin deposit with good bonding over a wider area on a<br>
substrate using multiple adjacent passes.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose an improved friction surfacing<br>
method to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder material which<br>
produces surface deposits with very low dilution using powder materials.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose an improved friction surfacing<br>
method including a tool to produce a surfaced layer on a substrate using powder<br>
material which is simple and economic.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>

invention.<br>
Fig-2 a schematic representation of the operating principle of the method<br>
according to the Invention.<br>
Description of a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
The present method involves use of a rotating tool of desired configuration as<br>
3<br><br><br>
shown in Figure-1. The tool body (1) has a hole (2) along its axis. The tip of<br>
the tool is profiled to enable transport and compaction of the powder material to<br>
form the deposit. The powder passes through the central hole (2) and a port (3)<br>
to a triangular profile (4). The rotating tool (1) initially approaches the surface<br>
(6) in which the material is to be deposited. Frictional heat is generated due the<br>
relative motion of the toot (1) under pressure and the stationary base material<br>
(6). A powder material (5) required to create the deposit is now fed through the<br>
hole (2) at the center of the tool (1). The bottom of the tool (1) has provisions<br>
for the discharge of the powder material (5) during the operation of the process,<br>
to a friction zone. The frictional heat generated softens the base material (6)<br>
and ) or the powder (5). The tool (1) enables the powder material (5) to be<br>
spread across the width of the tool (1).<br>
Simultaneously, the material is compressed, by a pressure generated in a vertical<br>
direction (8) on the tool (1) including the profile (5) of the tool (1) at its bottom<br>
side, into a compacted surface deposit (7). As the tool (1) moves in the lateral<br>
direction (8), a uniformly deposited surface is created. The deposit features can<br>
be controlled by controlling the feed rate of the powder (5) through the tool (1)<br>
at the friction interface. The principle of operation is shown in Fig.2.<br>
