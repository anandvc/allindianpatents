Patent Application of<br>
Wilmot H. McCutchen<br>
for<br>
Radial Counterflow Carbon Capture and Flue Gas Scrubbing<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relate-s to moving centrifugal gas separation and to mechanically<br>
assisted highly turbulent scrubbing of gaseous emission streams. No membranes or other dead-<br>
end filtration media nor any means for electrostatic separation are involved. This is a new<br>
method of carbon capture, suitable for high volume hot and dirty low concentration waste gas<br>
streams such as flue gas from coal-fired power plants.<br>
The separative method of the present invention comprises differential radial advection of<br>
light and heavy fractions. Light fractions (including nitrogen and water vapor) are advected<br>
radially inward by back pressure and axial suction, while simultaneously heavy fractions<br>
(including carbon dioxide, NOx, SOx, and particulates) are advected radially outward by<br>
centrifugal impellers. Flue gas from coal fired power plants is the principal application, but<br>
 <br>
other industrial waste gases, as well as natural gas, can be centrifugally separated and cleaned by<br>
the apparatus and method disclosed herein.<br>
In U.S. Pat. 5,688,377 to McCutchen (1997) I disclosed a peripherally fed mechanically<br>
driven radial counterflow device for fluid mixture separation. Axial feed and application to flue<br>
gas for particulate and other scrubbing is a non-obvious improvement with the advantage that in<br>
a peripherally fed device such as McCutchen '377, the separated heavy fractions would mix with<br>
incoming feed. Therefore carbon capture would be impossible.<br>
By the term gaseous emission stream is meant a gaseous fluid mixture such as flue gas<br>
nun: coal-fired utility and industrial boilers, exhaust from combustion of natural gas, diesel fuel,<br>
or oil, as well as emissions from municipal and medical waste incinerators, cement and lime<br>
kllns, metal smelters, petroleum refineries, glass furnaces, and sulfuric acid manufacturing<br>
facilities. A gaseous emission stream comprises ncn-condensibie gases, such as carbon dioxide<br>
and nitrogen, as well as condensible gases and aerosols. The various constituents, whether<br>
gaseous, liquid, or solid, of a gaseous emission stream are fractions.<br>
Wet scrubbing uses injected liquid to contact scrubbing targets in a gaseous emission<br>
stream. The injected liquid could be water, in the case of aerosol scrubbing, or an aqueous<br>
scrubbing slurry such as limestone and water in the case of SOx scrubbing. For NOx and SOx<br>
scrubbing, a chemical reaction occurs between a reagent in the injected liquid and the target<br>
fraction, producing harmless products. Carbon dioxide scrubbing by an injected aqueous amine<br>
solution is one means for carbon capture known to the art. Dry scrubbing of SOx injects<br>
limestone powder into flue gas. Wet scrubbing of fly ash agglomerates tiny particles by contact<br>
with water to produce a fly ash slurry.<br>
 <br>
The purpose of scrubbing is to separate a gaseous emission stream into a stream of<br>
concentrated unwanted fractions and a separate stream of desired fractions. For flue gas<br>
scrubbing, the unwanted fractions include fly ash and other aerosols, NOx, SOx, and carbon<br>
dioxide; desired fractions are nitrogen, water vapor, oxygen, and argon, all of which may be<br>
safely discharged to the atmosphere. For natural gas scrubbing, the desired fraction is methane<br>
and the unwanted fractions include carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, water, particulates,<br>
mercury, and niercaptans.<br>
Advection is transport responding to a pressure gradient or body force. The term radial<br>
aenotes a direction outward or inward with respect to some point or line. For example, a<br>
centrifugal pump advects fluid radially outward from its axis of rotation.<br>
Differential radial advection of a gaseous emission stream is advection of heavy fractions<br>
radially outward and simultaneous advection of light fractions radially inward. The reference<br>
line for said radial flow is the axis of rotation of said at least one centrifugal impeller. Different<br>
advecting forces act in opposite directions and on different constituents. Heavy fractions are<br>
advecied radially outward by momentum transport from the centrifugal impeller. Light fractions<br>
are adverted radially inward by axiai suction and by back pressure, simultaneously.<br>
Therefore differential radial advection is distinguishable from centrifugal gas separation<br>
as presently known to the art. Two rotations in combination produce differential radial<br>
advection: one rotation is of at least one centrifugal impeller, the other is vortices in a plane<br>
normal to the impeller. The axes of the two rotations are approximately orthogonal.<br>
Centrifugal gas separation is radial stratification by density about an axis of rotation due<br>
to differential centrifugal force. A common radial acceleration affects all fractions This<br>
common acceleration when multiplied by mass becomes differential centrifugal force, which<br>
 <br>
causes heavy fractions to concentrate at the periphery, displacing light fractions radially inward<br>
to the axis of rotation. Although different in magnitude for light and heavy fractions, centrifugal<br>
force is the same in direction for all fractions. There is no centrifugal force advecting heavy<br>
fractions and centripetal force advecting light fractions. There is only one force, created by one<br>
rotation.<br>
Coal Smoke.<br>
Carbonaceous fuel combustion produces a gaseous emission stream called smoke. Each<br>
constituent of smoke is a fraction. Noxious fractions in smoke from coal-fired power plants<br>
include sulfur oxides (SOx, principally S02 and S03), nitrogen oxides (NOx, principally NO and<br>
NO:), aerosols (fly ash. mercury vapor, dust, trace metals), and carbon dioxide (CO;). There are<br>
also benign fractions (nitrogen gas, oxygen, and water vapor) which constitute approximately<br>
85°o of smoke by volume. Air used for combustion contains about 79 % gaseous nitrogen (N:),<br>
which is inert, so flue gas is approximately 75% nitrogen. Water vapor (H2O) is created by<br>
combination of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen during combustion. Much of<br>
the plume from flue gas stacks is water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air.<br>
The benign fractions in smoke have lower density (lower molar mass) than the noxious<br>
fractions. Therefore nitrogen gas, oxygen gas, and water vapor are referred to collectively as<br>
light fractions, and the noxious fractions (aerosols, NOx, SOx, and carbon dioxide) are referred<br>
to as heavy fractions. Carbon capture is the separation of carbon dioxide from the light fractions,<br>
and scrubbing of flue gas in the present invention is the separation of the other noxious fractions<br>
from carbon dioxide, so as to produce a carbon dioxide stream of acceptable purity for<br>
downstream processing, including sequestration or making dry ice.<br>
 <br>
Coal is currently the dominant fuel in the power sector, accounting for 38% of electricity<br>
generated in 2000, with hydro power 17.5%, natural gas 17.3%, nuclear 16.8%, oil 9%, and non-<br>
hydro renewables 1.6%. Coal is projected to remain the dominant fuel for power generation in<br>
2020 (about 36%), and natural gas power generation will become the second largest source,<br>
surpassing hydro. To combat the urgent problem of global wanning, known post-combustion<br>
carbon capture methods (chemical sorption, membrane separation, and cryogenic distillation)<br>
would have to be scaled up to deal with the large streams of hot dirty dilute flue gas from coal<br>
fired and natural gas fired power plants. None has proved economically feasible so far.<br>
Carbon Capture.<br>
According to the IPCC Report on Carbon Capture (September 2005): "the power and<br>
industry sectors combined dominate current global C02 emissions, accounting for about 60% of<br>
total C02 emissions. Future projections indicate that the share of these sectoral emissions will<br>
decline to around 50% of global C02 emissions by 2050 (EA, 2002). The C02 emissions in<br>
these sectors are generated by boilers and furnaces burning fossil fuels and are typically emitted<br>
from large exhaust stacks.... The largest amount of C02 emitted from large stationary sources<br>
originates from fossil fuel combustion for power generation, with an average annual emission of<br>
3.9 MtC02 per source. Substantial amounts of C02 arise in the oil and gas processing industries<br>
while cement production is the largest emitter from the industrial sector.... The ranges of the<br>
technical capture potential relative to total C02 emissions are 9-12% (or 2.6-4.9 GtC02) by<br>
2020 and 21- 45% (or 4.7-37.5 GtC02) by 2050."<br>
Clearly there has long been a critical but unmet need for improved carbon capture from<br>
the gaseous emission streams of power plants. Two obstacles stand in the way of economical<br>
carbon capture. (1) the high volume percentage of nitrogen (~75%). known as nitrogen ballast;<br>
 <br>
and (2) the pollution of aerosols, NOx and SOx. Despite the efforts of many investigators having<br>
more than ordinary skill in the art of flue gas scrubbing or the art of centrifugal gas separation,<br>
no satisfactory answer to these two obstacles has been discovered. Any obvious steps using the<br>
teachings of McCutchen '377, which was published in 1997, or other prior art for the solution of<br>
such important problems, would have been evident long before now.<br>
Three carbon capture processes are known to the art: cryogenic distillation, sorption, and<br>
membranes. The present invention introduces a fourth.<br>
Cryogenic distillation captures carbon by liquefaction and separates out NOx and SOx by<br>
fractional distillation. Liquefaction is frustrated by nitrogen ballast, which compresses without<br>
liquefaction. The small partial pressure of NOx and SOx in flue gas (very much less than 1% by<br>
volume) and the small partial pressure of COz (10 -15% by volume) are both due to the high<br>
nitrogen ballast (75%).<br>
For sorbtion processes, nitrogen ballast makes carbon dioxide molecules like needles in a<br>
haystack, so an inordinate amount of wastewater is generated in contacting enough targets to<br>
achieve satisfactory collection efficiency. Fly ash, a fine glassy dust, plugs absorbers used in<br>
sorbtion processes. NOx and SOx combine with water to become corrosive acids and heat stable<br>
salts, causing loss in absorption capacity and coating of reclaimer tube surfaces. Aqueous amine<br>
scrubbing of carbon dioxide from natural gas is much easier than the same process applied to<br>
flue gas polluted by fly ash, NOx, and SOx.<br>
Membranes or other dead-end filtration media are impractical for large scale carbon<br>
capture from flue gas because of the presence of fly ash, which plugs the pores.<br>
In view of these problems, a need exists for an alternative means for carbon capture, and<br>
for improved scrubbing upstream of known carbon capture processes. Here is the position of the<br>
 <br>
U.S. Department of Energy: "The low pressure and dilute concentration dictate a high actual<br>
volume of gas to be treated. Trace impurities in the flue gas tend to reduce the effectiveness of<br>
the C02 adsorbing processes. Compressing captured C02 from atmospheric pressure to pipeline<br>
pressure (1,200 - 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi)) represents a large parasitic load."<br>
Both natural gas and coal-fired power plants emit voluminous streams of hot smoke,<br>
comprising 10 -15% by volume carbon dioxide (CO-) at approximately atmospheric pressure.<br>
These are low-concentration / low-partial-pressure sources, which are the most difficult for<br>
carbon capture.<br>
Nitrogen Extraction.<br>
No means for extracting nitrogen from flue gas upstream of carbon capture are known.<br>
Nitrogen (N2) is a harmless gas which constitutes 75% of the volume of flue gas from coal-fired<br>
power plants. This is referred to as nitrogen ballast. Nitrogen might be safely discharged to the<br>
Earth's atmosphere, which is already 78% nitrogen. Other benign light fractions in flue gas are<br>
oxygen (O2) (4%), water vapor (5%), and argon (1%). Altogether, approximately 85% of flue<br>
gas does not require any treatment at all, other than extraction. Extracting benign gases upstream<br>
of carbon capture would increase concentration of carbon dioxide from only 10 - 15% in the<br>
gaseous emission stream to over 90% in the feed gas to downstream carbon capture processes.<br>
Concentration of carbon dioxide might make carbon capture economically feasible.<br>
Extraction of nitrogen so as to concentrate carbon dioxide is theoretically possible<br>
because nitrogen and the other light fractions have small molar mass compared to carbon dioxide<br>
and the other heavy fractions. Centrifugal gas separation in an open system could theoretically<br>
solve the problem of nitrogen extraction.<br>
Centrifugal Gas Separation.<br>
 <br>
The molar mass of nitrogen gas (N2) is only 28 g/mol (grams per mole of gas); carbon<br>
dioxide (CO;) is 36% denser at 44 g/mol. Centrifugal gas separators which might exploit this<br>
36% density difference are of two classes: mechanically driven and pressure driven.<br>
Mechanically driven gas separators can exploit gas density differences as low as 1.5% ,<br>
far beyond the performance required for flue gas separation. The ultracentrifuge is a very<br>
delicately balanced cylinder rotating at extreme speed and generating very high g force which<br>
radially stratifies gases by density within the cylinder. Such rotating cylinder centrifugal gas<br>
separators are dangerous because of their extremely high rotation speed.<br>
Pressure driven devices include inertial collectors (also known as cyclones), and vortex<br>
tubes. Cyclones and vortex tubes are axial counterflow devices, wherein flow goes in opposite<br>
directions and the device is static.<br>
Inertial collectors are used extensively to process gaseous emission streams to remove<br>
most aerosols. Cyclones have no moving parts. Tangential feed injected through the wall of a<br>
tank swirls downward along the wall in a first vortex, then swirls upward in a second vortex<br>
inside the first vortex. This is axial counterflow. Solids are centrifugated out against the wall of<br>
the tank and are collected at the bottom, and a cleaned gas exits the top with the second vortex.<br>
Cyclones, even cascaded, are ineffective even for the relatively easy job of separating out 2.5<br>
micron fly ash. Nitrogen extraction by inertial collectors has not been reported and would appear<br>
to be impossible.<br>
Another pressure driven centrifugal gas separation device without moving parts is the<br>
vortex tube. The net effect of a vortex tube is to separate a high pressure stream into two low<br>
pressure streams, one hotter and the other colder than the original gas stream. Pressurized feed<br>
gas is tangentially injected into one end of a static tube having both ends open. The feed gas<br>
 <br>
spirals in a first vortex to the opposite end, where there is a conical central flow impedance. Hot<br>
gas exits the tube around the flow impedance. A recirculation flow rebounds from the flow<br>
impedance in a second vortex inside the first vortex and exits the feed end cooler than the feed<br>
gas. Residence time in the vortex tube is on the order of milliseconds. There are a variety of<br>
opinions about how the vortex rube effects separation of the feed gas by temperature.<br>
Application of the vortex tube has also been made to the separation of liquefied air into<br>
nitrogen and oxygen, to removing condensible vapors from natural gas, and to improving sorbent<br>
mixing for carbon dioxide scrubbing. The presence of fly ash in flue gas, the high energy<br>
requirement for pressurizing the feed, and the poor separation efficiency for gas/gas separation<br>
(gas fractionation) would appear to make the vortex tube unsuitable for extracting nitrogen from<br>
flue gas.<br>
Fly Ash and other Aerosols.<br>
Aerosols comprise fly ash, soot, condensible vapors, mist, and dust. These fractions are<br>
airborne because they are very small. Scrubbing of aerosols agglomerates these fractions so they<br>
can be separated more easily downstream. However, approximately 6% by mass of particle<br>
emissions from pulverized bituminous and sub-bituminous coal combustion is in the form of<br>
aerosols too small to separate by known processes or devices.<br>
Fly ash is fine inorganic (principally silicon dioxide) particulate matter formed during<br>
coal combustion. The most troublesome fly ash is in the form of minute glassy dust less than 2.5<br>
millionths of a meter (micron) in diameter (PM-2.5). Collected fly ash is valuable as a concrete<br>
additive and as a material for making durable and impervious bricks which require no firing. Fly<br>
ash can therefore be seen as both a problem and an unexploited resource.<br>
 <br>
Soot, another particulate emission, is uncombusted fuel, which is usually not a problem in<br>
power plants where combustion is complete. Combustion is frequently not complete, and in<br>
gaseous emission streams from ships and vehicles, soot is a serious problem.<br>
Other aerosols include vapors, mist, dust, and trace metals. Mercury and VOCs (volatile<br>
organic compounds) are condensible vapors which are regulated emissions because of their<br>
known harmful effect. Mist is tiny liquid droplets, including sulfuric acid droplets, water<br>
droplets, and droplets from condensed condensible vapors. Dust is airborne fragments of<br>
inorganic material. Trace metals in flue gas include uranium, arsenic, lead, cobalt, chromium,<br>
and thorium.<br>
Dry electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are the principal means used for collecting aerosols<br>
from coal-fired flue gas. Other industries using ESPs for emission control are cement (dust),<br>
pulp and paper (salt cake and lime dust), petrochemicals (sulfuric acid mist), and steel (dust and<br>
fumes). A cathode in the flow path of a gaseous emission stream imparts a negative charge to<br>
the entrained particles. A positively charged collector plate (anode) downstream in the flow path<br>
attracts the negative charges. Charged aerosols adhere to the collector plate and agglomerate in a<br>
coating. The coating is dislodged by rapping into a hopper.<br>
ESPs, when working properly and with the right fuel, may have an overall collection<br>
efficiency as high as 99.2%. Where ESPs fail is in collecting fly ash under 2.5 microns and other<br>
fine particulates. The size limit for effective aerosol collection in ESPs is approximately 10<br>
microns.<br>
Even lower collection efficiency for fine particulates is found in the performance of<br>
inertial collectors, such as cyclones. Estimated overall control efficiency for a cascade of<br>
multiple cyclones is 94%, but fine particulates mostly escape collection. Cyclones are often used<br>
 <br>
as a precollector upstream of an ESP, fabric filter, or wet scrubber so that these devices can be<br>
specified for lower particle loadings to reduce capital and/or operating costs.<br>
Wet Scrubbers for NOx, SOx, and Aerosols.<br>
The 94% overall collection efficiency for particulates in prior art wet scrubbers is inferior<br>
to the maximum collection efficiency of ESPs. Mechanically aided wet scrubbers known to the<br>
art spray liquid onto centrifugal fan blades as waste gas flows through the fan. The advantage of<br>
mechanical assistance is less water usage and a smaller footprint. Collection takes place in the<br>
spray and in the film that forms on the fan blades.<br>
Wet particulate scrubbers have the disadvantage of trading an air pollution problem for a<br>
water pollution problem.<br>
Venturi scrubbers, the most turbulent of wet scrubbers, have the highest collection<br>
efficiency. Venturis are pressure driven devices which jet a combined stream of waste gas and<br>
liquid through a nozzle into a tank. However, Venturis have the disadvantage that turbulence<br>
quickly dissipates into pressure. The time during which turbulent mixing occurs is short.<br>
For NOx and SOx, the injected scrubbing liquid is an aqueous solution comprising<br>
sorbents (lime or limestone for SOx, ammonia for NOx). The sorbents react with the target<br>
gases to produce harmless products.<br>
Removal efficiency for prior art wet SOx scrubbing ranges from 50 - 98%. As with all<br>
prior art wet scrubbers, the price paid for high removal efficiency is a large volume of dilute<br>
wastewater requiring storage and treatment and a consequent waste of space and resources. Dry<br>
SOx scrubbers have a lower removal efficiency, 
 <br>
A known carbon capture process used in processing natural gas is wet scrubbing with<br>
aqueous amine solution. NOx, SOx, and aerosols in flue gas complicate the application of this<br>
known technology to high volume hot and dirty exhaust gas streams.<br>
Low concentration of SOx and NOx (less than 1% by volume) in a high volume of<br>
nitrogen and other benign fractions means that a large amount of liquid must be injected in order<br>
to contact enough of the scarce scrubbing targets to achieve satisfactory removal efficiency.<br>
Low concentration also means that condensation is more difficult, due to low partial pressure.<br>
Summary of the Present Invention:<br>
This is a new method of carbon capture, which separates a clean gaseous stream of<br>
concentrated carbon dioxide from a gaseous emission stream dynamically in radial counterflow.<br>
Cascading devices achieve satisfactory collection efficiency to permit atmospheric discharge of<br>
axially extracted nitrogen and water vapor.<br>
An apparatus for differential radial advection of heavy and light fractions in flue gas from<br>
coal-fired power plants, or other gaseous emission streams, comprises means for axial feed<br>
between coaxial counter-rotating centrifugal impellers. High molar mass fractions (heavy<br>
fractions) such as carbon dioxide, NOx, SOx, mercury, and fly ash, are advected radially outward<br>
by the impellers into a tank. Low molar mass fractions (light fractions), such as nitrogen and<br>
water vapor, are advected radially inward by back pressure and axial suction, and are axially<br>
extracted to discharge or further treatment. Radial vortices between the impellers provide<br>
conduits for light fractions to flow radially inward, through the axial feed.<br>
Highly turbulent mechanically assisted mixing and scrubbing during a long residence time<br>
in the high shear between the impellers, in combination with said upstream axial extraction of<br>
 <br>
nitrogen ballast by differential radial advection, separates a clean stream of gaseous carbon<br>
dioxide from flue gas.<br>
Fly ash and precipitates are agglomerated into clumps of sludge by shear thickening in the<br>
turbulence, and are recovered from the tank. Gases produced by sorbent reactions are<br>
continuously removed from the shearing reaction zones at the periphery of turbulent vortices.<br>
Continuous extraction of inert gases away from scrubbing targets and turbulent mechanically<br>
assisted mixing minimize the volume of injected liquid required for satisfactory collection<br>
efficiency of NOx, SOx, and aerosols.<br>
The process may be thought of as organized turbulence. Tiny centrifugal separation<br>
effects in turbulent eddies are integrated by a forcing regime to produce radially divergent streams<br>
of heavy and light fractions, the heavy stream having a high concentration of carbon dioxide, and<br>
the light stream having a high concentration of nitrogen.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic cross-sectional elevational view of the preferred embodiment,<br>
tvi. apparatus for concentrating and scrubbing a gaseous emission stream such as flue gas from<br>
coal combustion. The axis of symmetry and the axis of rotation is the axis a - a. Discussion of<br>
Fig. 1 will focus on application of the preferred embodiment to coal-fired flue gas treatment,<br>
although it could be used for other gaseous emission streams.<br>
Feed gas (coal-fired power plant flue gas) flows continously from a source la through an<br>
axial feed conduit 1 and into a work space 3 through an axial feed port 2 in an impeller assembly<br>
19. Other gaseous emission streams include those from cement plants, sulfuric acid factories,<br>
medical waste incineration, industrial boilers, paper factories, steel mills, ships, and other<br>
industrial facilities. The term feed gas will refer to these as well. The term fluid refers to gases,<br>
liquids, and mixtures thereof. The term fluid mixture refers to mixtures of fluids, including<br>
mixtures comprising solids. Flue gas is a fluid mixture comprising heavy fractions (carbon<br>
dioxide, aerosols, sulfur oxides, mercury vapor, and nitrogen oxides) and light fractions (nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, and water vapor).<br>
The impeller assembly 19 comprises counter-rotatable centrifugal impellers 4,5 having a<br>
common axis of rotation a - a and a periphery 12. The impellers are preferably constructed of<br>
 <br>
rigid material, such as steel. Rotation of the impellers advects fluid radially outward in a work<br>
space 3 between the impellers. Suitable means (not shown) supporting the impellers maintain the<br>
impellers in an opposed and spaced-apart position so as to maintain the work space 3 between<br>
them. The preferred drive means shown in Fig. 7 maintains the impeller separation by the drive<br>
wheel 38. As shown, the separation between the supported impellers varies radially outward from<br>
their axis of rotation a - a, thereby defining a pinch section 17 and a flare section 18. Preferably,<br>
the impeller assembly is grounded by suitable means (not shown) to prevent shock.<br>
The centrifugal impellers 4,5 of the impeller assembly 19 are connected by suitable means<br>
tor connection 8 to drive means 7. The preferred embodiment of the drive means and connection<br>
means for causing approximately exact counter-rotation is shown in Figs. 7a and 7b. Shown in<br>
Fig. 1 are alternative drive means 7 connected to each impeller. The impellers rotate<br>
approximately at the same angular velocity but in opposite directions. Preferably, for flue gas<br>
treatment on a large scale, rotation speed for each of the impellers is less than 1000 revolutions<br>
per minute (rpm). Many suitable drive means 7 are known to the art, including separate motors<br>
for each impeller, and various suitable means for connection 8 so as to cause counter-rotation of<br>
the impellers are known, including belt drives and gears. For example, airplanes and helicopters<br>
ha\ing counter-rotating propellers connected by planetary gears are known.<br>
The impellers comprise vanes 6. Various vane designs are known to the art and could be<br>
used, including curved vanes as shown in Fig. 2 or angled blades. Viewed in superposition, the<br>
vanes of the top and bottom impellers cross. Therefore, during counter-rotation, there will be<br>
numerous points in the work space where shear is high between the vanes, and there will be a<br>
continuous radially outward movement of those points. Vanes in the flare section 18 at the<br>
periphery 12 serve to compress fluid flowing through the periphery into an annular tank 13 and to<br>
 <br>
create a recirculation flow pressure 32. Vanes near the axial feed port 2 sen'e to advect feed gas<br>
radially outward into the work space 3. Vanes near the axial exhaust port serve to protect flow<br>
through the axial exhaust port from pollution of heavy fractions by advecting heavy fractions<br>
radially outward away from the axial exhaust port 9. See Fig. 5.<br>
Feed gas driven by the impellers 4,5 of the impeller assembly 19 flows from the axial<br>
feed inlet 2 through the work space 3 to the periphery 12 and into a tank 13 in a radially outward<br>
flow path between counter-rotating centrifugal impellers. Said flow radially outward from the<br>
axis a - a will be referred to as source flow. Source flow comprises heavy fractions, injected<br>
liquid, and unseparated light fractions. Source flow is turbulent due to high shear.<br>
Source flow between the impellers is impeded at a pinch section 17 where the impeller<br>
surfaces converge and become closely separated. The pinch section is effectively a convergent<br>
nozzle, therefore source flow velocity decreases. Drag force opposes the source flow and<br>
increases residence time of the feed gas in the high shear environment between the impellers.<br>
Mixing of the feed gas with injected scrubbing liquid is enhanced by high turbulence which is<br>
mechanically forced. Stalling of source flow at the pinch section differentially affects the light<br>
fractions and aids in axial extraction of nitrogen and water vapor to concentrate the scrubbing<br>
targets, as will be explained below.<br>
After passing the pinch section 17, what remains of the feed gas after axial extraction of<br>
the light fractions flows into a flare section 18, where the separation between the impellers<br>
increases. Scrubbing targets, including particulates, NOx, and SOx, have been concentrated and<br>
scrubbing liquid has been mixed into the flue gas. The flare section is effectively a divergent<br>
nozzle. Vanes 6 on the impellers at the flare section, force fluid radially outward into a tank 13.<br>
The rotation of the impellers pressurizes the tank.<br>
 <br>
A tank 13 receives flow through the periphery 12. Preferably, the tank is an annulus<br>
disposed about the impeller periphery and connected to the impellers 4,5 through movable seals<br>
29. The seals maintain tank pressure and permit the impellers to slide against the static tank wall.<br>
Tank pressure aids in condensing SOx and NOx within the tank, as well as condensing mercury<br>
vapor and water vapor. Impellers at the flare section 18 of the impeller assembly pressurize the<br>
tank. A recirculation flow pressure 32 due to tank pressure is shown by the right-pointing arrow.<br>
The tank comprises a gas vent 27 communicating with the tank interior and providing<br>
means for releasing carbon dioxide out of the pressurized tank for further processing. The gas<br>
v-'-'ni could be of many designs known to the art. The gas vent 27 could also be a Joule-Thomson<br>
expansion valve. Carbon dioxide in the tank remains gaseous and monitoring means (not shown)<br>
communicating with the gas vent regulate the purity of the stream allowed to escape from the tank<br>
through the gas vent 27. The stream through the gas vent has a high concentration of carbon<br>
dioxide and has been scrubbed of NOx, SOx and aerosols. If necessary, a second device of the<br>
same design receives the output of the gas vent as feed. Cascading devices remove nitrogen,<br>
NOx, SOx, and aerosols from the concentrated carbon dioxide stream coming through the gas<br>
vent 27.<br>
The tank also comprises a purge pump 28 communicating with the tank interior and<br>
providing means for pumping solids and liquids out of the tank. The purge pump could be of<br>
many designs known to the art, including a progressive cavity pump or simply a valve. Flow<br>
through the purge pump 28 is a concentrated stream of heavy fractions, including injected liquid,<br>
condensates, and particulates from the flue gas. Condensates include condensed NOx and SOx<br>
and mercury. Particulates include agglomerated fly ash and other aerosols, as well as precipitates<br>
produced by wet scrubbing. Fig. 4 shows a detail of the tank.<br>
 <br>
The work of the impellers 6 creates a recirculating flow pressure 32, or back pressure,<br>
which opposes the source flow and also increases residence time in the pinch section 17. As can<br>
be seen, the flare section 18 is effectively a convergent nozzle for back pressure 32 from the tank<br>
13 and at the same time is a divergent nozzle for source flow. Back pressure 32 is focussed into<br>
the shear layer and serves to drive light fractions radially inward. Heavy fractions flow along the<br>
surfaces of the impellers radially outward into the tank, around the back pressure. Pressure in the<br>
tank 13 condenses water vapor, unreacted NOx, unreacted SOx, and mercury, which flow through<br>
a purge pump 28 to collection along with agglomerated aerosols and precipitates from scrubbing.<br>
The combination of recirculating flow pressure and high shear between the impellers,<br>
which have high tangential velocity at the periphery, causes very high turbulence in the flare<br>
section 18. Reynolds numbers on the order of 107 have been reported for analogous von Karman<br>
swirling flow in a closely shrouded closed system setup comprising exactly counter-rotating<br>
impellers having a high aspect ratio. Therefore excellent mixing occurs in the flare section 18.<br>
Mixing of injected liquid with the gas in the flare section, which has been concentrated by axial<br>
extraction of nitrogen, wets particulates and contacts NOx and SOx and C02. Turbulent vortices<br>
allow for radially inward extraction of gases produced by sorbent reactions, thus favoring the<br>
forward reaction and improving scrubbing efficiency. Mechanically forced turbulence, unlike<br>
pressure forced turbulence as with a venturi, will not dissipate and can be continued as long as<br>
necessary. Residence time is superior to what is possible with centrifugal mechanically assisted<br>
wet scrubbers known to the art, which are rapid flow-through devices.<br>
Residence time in the flare section 18 and the tank 13 can be regulated by adjusting<br>
impeller speed and tank evacuation to assure satisfactory scrubbing for a given feed flow. A<br>
 <br>
second device, using the output of the first device as feed gas, would permit tank evacuation even<br>
before scrubbing were completed, in the event of a high feed flow.<br>
Condensation of NOx and SOx and mercury occurs in the pressurized tank 13, leaving a<br>
gaseous stream of concentrated carbon dioxide coming through the gas vent 27. Nitrogen ballast<br>
has been axially extracted upstream of compression. The boiling point of sulfur dioxide is high at<br>
-10°C (263 K) and sulfur trioxide is higher at 45°C. Nitrogen dioxide's boiling point is also high,<br>
at 21.1 °C. Scrubbing of NOx, SOx, and mercury from the concentrated carbon dioxide stream by<br>
condensation under the tank pressure and by the turbulent sorbent mixing induced by the impeller<br>
assembly produces a liquid in the tank having a high concentration of these noxious fractions.<br>
The liquid in the tank is evacuated from the tank through the purge pump 28.<br>
An axial exhaust port 9 at the center of the top impeller 5 communicates with an axial<br>
exhaust conduit 10. An axial pump 11 communicates with the axial exhaust conduit and provides<br>
means for extracting fluid from the work space 3 while the impellers counter-rotate about the axis<br>
a - a Said flow radially inward toward the axis a - a will be referred to as sink flow.<br>
Sink flow is primarily of light fractions, including nitrogen, water vapor, and oxygen.<br>
These gaseous fractions constitute approximately 85% of the volume of flue gas and other<br>
industrial gaseous emission streams. Sink flow is driven by the suction of the axial pump 11 and<br>
by recirculating flow pressure 32 caused by the impellers. The reason that light fractions are<br>
differentially advected radially inward is that turbulent eddy vortices concentrate light fractions at<br>
tiny vortex axes and away from the impellers, and radial vortices 21 provide coherent low<br>
pressure gradients linking these capillaries into an arterial sink flow.<br>
A shear layer 31 exists in the work space 3 due to counter-rotation of the impellers. The<br>
shear layer is in a plane approximately equidistant from the impellers and approximately normal<br>
 <br>
to their axis of rotation. Against each impeller is an adherent boundary layer 30 of fluid which<br>
rotates along with the impeller. These boundary layers shear each other. Radial vortices 21<br>
created by shear of the boundary layers in the shear layer are an array of coherent tubular vortices<br>
having axes radial to the impeller axis of rotation a - a, like spokes in a wheel with the axis a - a<br>
as the axle. See Figs. 2,3a, 3b, and 5 for more on radial vortices.<br>
The radial vortices 21 provide conduits for flow radially inward to the axial exhaust port<br>
9, or sink flow. Said sink flow conduits exist although feed gas flows around them because there<br>
is sufficient mass flow through the radial vortices to sustain coherence. Sink flow is forced by the<br>
suction of an axial pump 11 and by the back pressure 32 caused by the impeller assembly pushing<br>
fluid into a shrouding tank 13.<br>
Von Karman swirling flow is the name given to the flow in a cylindrical vessel between<br>
counter-rotating disks. Recirculation flow from the shrouding cylinder wall, together with the<br>
shear between the impellers, can cause extremely high turbulence (Re - 107). However,<br>
investigations of von Karman swirling flow have only considered closed vessels with close<br>
shrouding walls and high aspect ratios. No flow-through device for performing useful tasks has<br>
been disclosed.<br>
A baffle 14 protects the axial exhaust port 9 from intrusion of feed gas. The baffle is<br>
connected to the bottom impeller 4 by vanes 6. The baffle rotates along with the bottom impeller.<br>
The vanes and baffle define spiral feed conduits 15 for introducing fluid into the work space 3.<br>
Injection ports 16 in the spiral feed conduits communicate with a liquid source 20 and provide<br>
means for introducing a liquid, such as water or sorbent slurry or solution, into the work space 3<br>
along with the feed gas. Preferably, the injection port comprises a Lobestar ® vortex mixing<br>
nozzle. Pressurized liquid injection through the injection ports or suction of liquid from the liquid<br>
 <br>
source by feed gas flow could both be used, but pressurized injection is preferable. Feed gas<br>
mixes with injected liquid in the spiral feed conduits. The mixture swirls around the axes of the<br>
radial vortices in radially outward source flow simultaneous with said radially inward sink flow of<br>
light fractions through the radial vortices 21. Feed gas which may somehow enter the space<br>
between the baffle and the top impeller is centrifugated out away from the axes of the radial<br>
vortices and the eddies and collects at the impeller surfaces where it is advected radially outward<br>
away from the axial exhaust port 9.<br>
The foregoing simultaneous radial source-sink flow will be referred to as radial<br>
counterflow. Radial counterflow is different from axial counterflow (as practiced in a cyclone or<br>
a vortex tube) even though the counterflow is about the same axis. The difference is that the axis<br>
of the counterflow vortices is radial to the axis of rotation of the driving device. Furthermore,<br>
known axial counterflow devices are driven by feed pressure, whereas radial counterflow as<br>
disclosed in the present invention is mechanically driven.<br>
An axial pump 11 communicates with the work space 3 through the axial exhaust conduit<br>
10 and the axial exhaust port 9. The suction of the axial pump 11 causes fluid to flow from the<br>
work space 3 through the axial exhaust port 9 and through the axial exhaust conduit 10 while the<br>
impellers 4, 5 are rotating.<br>
Preferably, the axial pump is a steam ejector/eductor, which could be of various designs<br>
known to the art, sized to assure constant flow through the axial exhaust port 9 as feed is<br>
introduced through the axial feed port 2. Blowdown steam is abundant at the site of coal-fired<br>
power plants and could be used for the ejector 11, which does not need to be extremely high tech<br>
in order to provide the necessary sink flow. Alternative axial pumps are nitrogen ejectors or<br>
blowers and other designs for gas flow known to the art.<br>
 <br>
Recirculation flow pressure 32 aids the axial pump 11 in extracting light fractions from<br>
the work space. Flow through the axial exhaust conduit 10 is a stream having a high<br>
concentration of light fractions, including nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor, at least higher than<br>
the concentration of the light fractions in the feed. The flow through the axial exhaust conduit<br>
could be feed for another device according to the present invention in order to scrub out<br>
remaining pollutants, or might even be immediately emitted to the atmosphere if low enough<br>
concentration of pollutants has been achieved in the first stage.<br>
A cascade of scrubbers according to the design shown in Fig. 1 and using the output of the<br>
axial exhaust conduit as feed for subsequent stages scrubs enough of the heavy fractions<br>
remaining in the light fraction stream to permit discharge of the light fraction stream to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Nitric oxide (NO, molar mass 30 g/mol) which may be present in the light fraction stream<br>
is decomposed in a catalytic converter (not shown) prior to discharge. The operation of the<br>
catalytic converter is enhanced by the upstream scrubbing of particulates and other noxious<br>
fractions.<br>
Operation of the Preferred Embodiment.<br>
Turbulence is conventionally regarded as a useless degradation of mechanical energy, and<br>
therefore unworthy of interest except as a nuisance. In the present invention, turbulence is<br>
harnessed for carbon capture and scrubbing of flue gas. The forcing regime of an axial pump and<br>
a centrifugal impeller assembly, which force flow in opposite directions, integrates the tiny<br>
centrifugation effects of turbulent vortices to produce differential radial advection of light and<br>
heavy fractions in the gaseous emission stream. Simultaneous source-sink flow is possible<br>
 <br>
through the work space because radial vortices provide sink flow conduits through the source<br>
flow.<br>
Eddies in the shear layer and high turbulence between the counter-rotating impellers<br>
provide low pressure gradients where low density fractions, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and water<br>
vapor, concentrate. Said low pressure gradients communicate circuitously with the low pressure<br>
in the axial exhaust conduit 10 caused by the suction of the axial pump 11. Radial vortices 21<br>
provide sink flow conduits for high mass flow of light fractions radially inward. Sink flow is<br>
forced by the suction of the axial pump 11 and by a recirculation flow pressure, or back pressure<br>
32 caused by centrifugal flow increasing the tank pressure.<br>
Because it is the light fractions which are in high concentration at the turbulent eddy<br>
vortices squeezed by the back pressure and sucked by the axial pump, and it is the heavy fractions<br>
which are in high concentration away from the eddy vortex axes and near the centrifugal<br>
impellers, there is differentia] radial advection of heavy and light fractions. Radially outward<br>
flow, or source flow, between the impellers has a high concentration of carbon dioxide, NOx,<br>
SOx, and aerosols. Radially inward flow, or sink flow, has a high concentration of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, and water vapor. Different fractions are advected in different directions, and are thus<br>
separated by density.<br>
An array of co-rotating radial vortices 21 points to the impeller axis a - a like spokes in a<br>
wheel (cf. von Karman swirling flow). The radial vortices 21 are sink flow conduits<br>
communicating circuitously with the low pressure gradients at the eddy vortex axes, which serve<br>
as capillaries feeding sink flow. Each radial vortex comprises coaxial source and sink flows. The<br>
impellers drive a source flow swirling around the radial vortex axis and radially outward from the<br>
impeller axis. Recirculation flow pressure 32 from the impellers and the suction of the axial<br>
 <br>
pump 11 drives a sink flow swirling inside said source flow and radially inward toward the<br>
impeller axis. See Fig. 5.<br>
At each eddy periphery is a concentration of heavy fractions, and adjacent eddies grind<br>
heavy fractions together at their peripheries. Injected water, a heavy fraction, contacts<br>
particulates and NOx and SOx, also heavy fractions, as they grind together at the eddy<br>
peripheries. Fly ash contacted by injected water becomes fly ash slurry. Fly ash slurry at vortex<br>
peripheries shear thickens into clumps of agglomerated particles. The clumps tumble in the<br>
turbulence and adsorb other clumps and aerosols. Agglomerated aerosols and precipitates in the<br>
tank are in large clumps of sludge and therefore are easy to separate from the wastewater.<br>
Nitrogen and other gases which envelop scrubbing targets are stripped away into the eddy<br>
vortex axes, thereby improving wetting of particulates, NOx and SOx. Also, gases produced by<br>
scrubbing reactions are removed from the reaction zone through the radial vortices, favoring the<br>
forward scrubbing reaction by removing reaction products. Residence time is long, turbulence is<br>
high, therefore collection efficiency for even fine particulates is high.<br>
It is important to recognize the difference between radial counterflow and axial<br>
counterflow. Axial counterflow, as practiced by the vortex tube and the cyclone (both pressure<br>
driven static devices) is coaxial source and sink flows centered on the centerline of a tube or a<br>
conical tank. Radial counterflow (which is mechanically driven by counter-rotating centrifugal<br>
impellers and an axial pump) is coaxial source and sink flows in a plane approximately normal to<br>
a centrifugal impeller axis of rotation a - a. Fig. 5 shows the orthogonal axes characteristic of<br>
radial counterflow.<br>
The axial pump 11 draws light fractions (such as nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor)<br>
radially inward toward the impeller axis through the radial vortices and stretches the radial vortex<br>
 <br>
axes, Flow swirling around the radial vortices and radially outward between the impellers also<br>
stretches the vortex axes. Stretching the vortex axes increases vorticity and sustains coherence of<br>
the radial vortices.<br>
The axial pump 11 is not an essential feature, but is preferred. The addition of an axial<br>
pump 11 is preferred because the volume of sink flow is large and the mass flow through conduits<br>
downstream to eventual discharge needs to be aided to avoid stagnation of sink flow in the work<br>
space. Approximately 85% of the feed (by volume) becomes sink flow, and extracting such a<br>
large volume from the work space is easier with an axial pump to drive sink flow through the<br>
adial vortices.<br>
In addition to coal-fired flue gas, other feed gas from the feed gas source la could be<br>
gaseous emissions from fossil fuel power plants such as natural gas generators, oil-fired boilers,<br>
or internal combustion engines, as well as from cement plants, pulp and paper plants,<br>
petrochemical plants, steel plants, municipal waste facilities, medical waste facilities, and other<br>
sources of noxious gas mixtures. Also suitable for feed is polluted air from mines and buildings,<br>
natural gas, or vacuum cleaner intake. These applications are covered by the claims.<br>
Discussion focuses on use of the preferred embodiment as a pre-treatment device for<br>
cleaning and concentrating a carbon dioxide stream out of a feed stream of flue gas from coal-<br>
fired power plants. The carbon dioxide stream is to be feed for carbon capture processes. This<br>
discussion is by way of illustration and is not intended to limit application of the preferred<br>
embodiment to other gaseous feed streams.<br>
Coal-fired power plant flue gas is a major culprit in global warming and air pollution.<br>
This smoke is a high temperature gaseous emission stream comprising benign fractions including<br>
nitrogen, water vapor and oxygen, which constitute approximately 85% by volume. The benign<br>
 <br>
fractions have low density relative to the other fractions in flue gas and therefore are called light<br>
fractions. Nitrogen gas (N;) has a molar mass of 28 g'mol; water vapor (H20) is 18 g/mol; and<br>
oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol.<br>
Heavy fractions in the smoke include carbon dioxide (CO2), which has a molar mass of 44<br>
g/mol, nitrogen oxides (NOx, principally NO2 which has a molar mass of 46 g/mol), sulfur oxides<br>
(SOx, principally S02 which is 64 g/mol, and SO3 which is 80 g/mol), mercury vapor (200 g/mol),<br>
mist, fly ash. soot, and dust. The heavy fractions are significantly more dense than the light<br>
fractions, hence the name heavy fractions.<br>
To explain further the application of molar mass to density, a mole is Avogadro's Number<br>
(6.022xl023) of gas molecules. Applied to a gas mixture, like flue gas, this many molecules of the<br>
mixture occupy a certain volume according to their temperature and pressure, and whatever that<br>
volume is, each constituent in the gas mixture contributes a certain mass, which is its molar mass.<br>
Molar mass indicates relative density of the constituent gases in an emission stream. Nitrogen is<br>
less dense at 28 g/mol (i.e. 28 grams per whatever volume the mole occupies) than carbon dioxide<br>
at 44 g/mol. That is a density difference of 36%.<br>
While the centrifugal impellers 4,5 of the impeller assembly 19 counter-rotate about their<br>
axis a -a, fluid flow is simultaneous and continuous through the axial feed port 2, the axial<br>
exhaust port 9, and the periphery 12. In other words, feed gas through the feed port 2 is<br>
continously divided within the impeller assembly 19 into two continuous streams: (1) a radially<br>
inward (toward the axis a -a) sink flow of light fractions (in flue gas: nitrogen gas, water vapor,<br>
and oxygen) through the exhaust conduit 10, and (2) a radially outward source flow of heavy<br>
fractions (in flue gas: carbon dioxide, liquids, mercury, fly ash, NOx and SOx) through the<br>
periphery 12. In the tank 13 which receives the flow through the periphery 12, said heavy<br>
 <br>
fraction stream diverges into a concentrated carbon dioxide stream going through the gas vent27<br>
and a stream of concentrated liquids, solids, NOx, and SOx going through the purge pump 28.<br>
Pollution of sink flow by feed flow is prevented by the baffle 14 and also by the counter-<br>
rotation of the centrifugal impellers, which create radial vortices that act as protective sink flow<br>
conduits and create radial counterflow of source and sink flow. See Fig. 2. Each eddy vortex in<br>
the mixing zone 22 of the turbulence between the impellers radially stratifies light and heavy<br>
fractions and keeps them separate.<br>
By the flare section 18 of the impeller assembly, the source flow of feed gas through the<br>
axial feed port 2 has become a turbulent and enriched source flow of concentrated heavy<br>
fractions, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, fly ash, aerosols, and<br>
injected liquid. Axial extraction of nitrogen, water vapor, and oxygen, has concentrated the<br>
targets for scrubbing, and the turbulence in the flare section caused by the shear between the<br>
impellers and the back pressure from the shrouding tank causes excellent mixing and shear<br>
thickening of fly ash slurry produced by wet scrubbing.<br>
Cooling of carbon dioxide captured in the tank by differential radial advection and<br>
scrubbed by said turbulence occurs through axial extraction of light fractions together with their<br>
heat through the axial exhaust conduit 10, by liquid injection, by expansion, and by heat transfer<br>
with the impellers through the heat transfer means 26,26a. Expansion of the pressurized carbon<br>
dioxide in the tank through the gas vent 27 cools it further. Suitable means known to the art can<br>
use the concentrated, cooled and cleaned carbon dioxide stream issuing through the gas vent<br>
change the stream into a form suitable for sequestration or other treatment.<br>
Shear between the impellers should keep the flow path into the tank for heavy fractions<br>
clear. Periodic injections of abrasive particles, such as bottom ash, through the axial feed conduit<br>
 <br>
1 while the impellers are in counter-rotation could clean the impeller surfaces.<br>
The liquid injected depends on the wet scrubbing to be performed. For SOx, a slurry of<br>
sorbents known to the art (lime or limestone for example) would be the liquid, for NOx the<br>
sorbent known to the art is ammonia, and for fly ash plain water.<br>
High shear between the counter-rotating impellers 4,5 creates high turbulence in the flow<br>
path of feed gas through the work space 3, Turbulence results in a drag force which reduces the<br>
velocity of radially outward flow, thus increasing time available for mixing liquid with with<br>
aerosols and the NOx and SOx gases. Back pressure 32 from the shrouding tank 13 also increases<br>
residence time for turbulent scrubbing. Turbulence causes aerosols to collide and cohere and<br>
improves wetting of particles enveloped by adhering gas molecules.<br>
Extraction of gases, such as carbon dioxide produced by wet scrubbing sorbent reactions,<br>
into the eddy vortices favors the forward scrubbing reaction. Unreacted SOx and NOx is too<br>
dense to join the sink flow of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide in the flare<br>
section and tumbles in the turbulence of the flare section 18 until it is reacted. Long residence<br>
time of SOx in this recirculation through high turbulence results in high collection efficiency.<br>
Pressure in the tank 13 caused by the impeller assembly 19 improves collection efficiency by<br>
condensing unreacted SOx and NOx.<br>
Latent heat in water vapor and heat in the extracted nitrogen is available through the axial<br>
exhaust conduit 10 to be recycled into power production, such as by preheating feedwater, instead<br>
of going out the smokestack to heat the atmosphere, which could improve efficiency of power<br>
generation by as much as 10%.<br>
Cascading numerous devices of the present invention would further cool, concentrate, and<br>
clean the carbon dioxide captured from the flue gas. The output of the first device (through the<br>
 <br>
gas vent 27) is the feed to a second radial counterflow separator, and so on, with the concentration<br>
and purity of carbon dioxide increasing at each stage.<br>
Dry scrubbing, without water injection, could also be practiced in the present invention,<br>
with fine particulate matter agglomerating by collisions in the highly turbulent flow and cohering<br>
by van der Waals force. Kinetic energy in turbulence, especially where eddy vortex peripheries<br>
grind together, overcomes electrostatic repulsion and allows particles to stick together in inelastic<br>
collisions. Dry scrubbing is aided by extraction of gases into the eddy vortices, which removes<br>
the shielding envelope of gas surrounding fine particles. However, wet scrubbing is preferred for<br>
the gaseous emission stream produced by coal-fired power plants because the water also captures<br>
S03 and other gases, and it improves the collection of fly ash sludge by shear thickening.<br>
Preferably, the impellers and the tank are cooled by suitable means known to the art 26,<br>
26a such as air or liquid flow against the outside surfaces of the impeller assembly 19, so as to<br>
enhance heat exchange with the hot gas in the work space 3.<br>
The centrifugated sorbent, wet or dry, serves to drag feed gas radially outward through the<br>
turbulence in the pinch section 17 between the impellers and into the flare section 18 of the<br>
impeller assembly, where very high turbulence exists due to the combination of high tangential<br>
velocity of the counter-rotating impellers and back pressure 32.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art of emissions control will be able to adjust by theory or<br>
experimentation the impeller separation, diameter, and rotation speed relative to the feed conduit<br>
diameter and pressure and temperature conditions of the inlet and outlets to achieve the most<br>
effective fluid separation for various fluid fractions and flow rates. It is important to note,<br>
however, that the flow through the periphery 12 will have been reduced significantly in mass<br>
 <br>
from the flow through the feed conduit, due to the axial extraction of nitrogen and water vapor<br>
through the axial exhaust conduit 10.<br>
Figure 2 shows a top view of half of the work space 3 in the preferred embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 1 during counter-rotation of the impellers, looking toward the bottom impeller 4.<br>
Direction of impeller rotation is shown by the arrow. Discussion focuses on use of the preferred<br>
embodiment for capture of carbon dioxide from flue gas. The top impeller 5 is invisible and so is<br>
the baffle 14. These are shown in Fig. 1 but not here.<br>
Feed gas enters the work space 3 from the axial feed inlet 2 and is centrifugally impelled<br>
radially outward from the impeller axis of rotation a - a by curved vanes 6. Shown are a plurality<br>
of spiral vanes, but a variety of vane designs known to the art of centrifugal pumps could be used.<br>
Injection ports 16 introduce liquid into the feed gas. Direction of rotation of the bottom impeller<br>
4 is shown by an arrow. Rotation of the bottom impeller and its vanes 6 drives injected liquid and<br>
feed gas into the work space and radially outward to the periphery 12. Injected liquid from the<br>
injection ports 16 atomizes and the centrifugated droplets drag feed gas radially outward.<br>
A shear layer 31 exists between the counter-rotating centrifugal impellers, and within the<br>
shear layer is an array of coherent co-rotating radial vortices 21 pointing to the axis of rotation a -<br>
a like spokes in a wheel having the impeller axis a - a as its hub. The radial vortices are shown<br>
truncated approximately where the baffle 14 would be because the radial vortices extend to the<br>
axial exhaust port 9, not shown here because the top impeller is invisible. The radial vortices are<br>
conduits for sink flow of light fractions radially inward through the work space 3 toward the<br>
impeller axis a - a.<br>
The work space 3 comprises three concentric rings: a laminar ring 23 nearest the center of<br>
the work space and the axis of rotation of the impellers^ a turbulent ring 24 distal to the laminar<br>
 <br>
ring, and an expansion ring 25 distal to the turbulent ring and extending to the periphery 12. Flow<br>
is relatively less turbulent in the laminar ring than in the turbulent ring, but there is turbulence in<br>
all rings. The turbulent ring 23 is at the pinch section 17 and the expansion ring 18 is at the flare<br>
section of the impeller assembly 19. Turbulence in the expansion ring may be even greater than<br>
in the turbulent ring. It is useful to picture the turbulence between the impellers as a chaotic<br>
sponge of heavy fraction shells and light fraction voids. Centrifugal separation by radial density<br>
stratification within vortices large and small creates the shells and voids.<br>
Light fractions including nitrogen and water vapor concentrate along the axis of each<br>
turbulent eddy vortex, forming voids or vacuoles having low density and low pressure. Heavy<br>
fractions are centrifugated to the periphery of each vortex, forming shells, or crusts having high<br>
density. High pressure exists in the heavy fractions because they are confined by the impellers<br>
and grinding on each other as adjacent vortices rotate. When the shells grind together, fly ash,<br>
NOx, and SOx mix with injected liquid. Shells can grind together a long time because turbulence<br>
is mechanically forced by the impellers. Shear between adjacent vortices agglomerates and shear<br>
thickens fly ash slurry into easily separable clumps of sludge.<br>
Feed gas also stratifies radially by density about the impeller axis a - a, which is<br>
orthogonal to the vortex axes in the shear layer. Differential radial advection drives heavy<br>
fractions radially outward to the periphery 12 and light fractions radially inward through the<br>
radial vortices 21 to the axial exhaust port 9. Extraction of nitrogen and water vapor from carbon<br>
dioxide is continuous, both in the turbulent eddies and in the bulk. The present invention<br>
provides means for connecting the heretofore useless centrifugal separation performed by<br>
turbulent eddies with the centrifugal separation performed by centrifugal impellers and the axial<br>
 <br>
pump. The tiny effects in turbulence are integrated by the forcing regime to produce separation of<br>
gaseous fluid mixtures by density.<br>
Figure 3a shows a detailed schematic cross-section of the laminar ring 23 of the work<br>
space between the impellers 4, 5 of the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 1. A shear layer 31<br>
between boundary layers 30 against the impellers has high vorticity due to counter-rotation of the<br>
centrifugal impellers 4,5 as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3b. Feed gas is introduced through radial<br>
feed conduits 15 as shown by an arrow. Highly turbulent mixing occurs in a mixing zone 22<br>
between counter-rotating centrifugal impellers 4,5.<br>
Eddy vortices in the mixing zone 22 centrifugate heavy fractions (including carbon dioxide,<br>
NOx, SOx, and particulates) away from their vortex axes, where light fractions (including<br>
nitrogen, water vapor, and oxygen) concentrate. Heavy fractions concentrate in the boundary<br>
layers 30 against the impellers. Rotation of the impellers causes molecules of heavy fractions to<br>
flow radially outward. Light fractions are preferentially advected radially inward toward the<br>
impeller axis, in sink flow, by the suction of an axial pump shown in Fig. 1 and by back pressure<br>
32 as explained under Fig. 1. Said differential radial advection of light and heavy fractions occurs<br>
because of radial stratification of fractions by density in the vortices of the shear layer. See Fig. 5<br>
for a more detailed explanation.<br>
Radial vortices 21 in the shear layer 31 provide coherent conduits for sink flow 34 (shown<br>
by arrows) of light fractions radially inward toward the impeller axis of rotation a - a. Each radial<br>
vortex comprises a peripheral swirling source flow 33 of feed gas (first vortex) and a coaxial<br>
interior swirling sink flow 34 of light fractions (second vortex). Both the source flow and the sink<br>
flow stretch the vortex axis, increasing vorticity and sustaining coherence. Unlike the counterflow<br>
 <br>
in a vortex tube, this counterflow is not driven by feed pressure but by the centrifugal impellers<br>
and the axial pump operating simultaneously.<br>
Axes of the vortices in the shear layer are generally aligned in the plane of the shear layer<br>
31. Should any axis stick out of the shear layer, it would be torqued back into the shear layer plane<br>
by the counter-rotating boundary layers 30. The combined work of numerous tiny centrifugating<br>
eddies in the bulk eventually concentrates heavy fractions away from the shear layer and toward<br>
the surfaces of the impellers where they concentrate in the boundary layers 30. Concentration of<br>
heavy fractions in the boundary layers advected by the impellers increases toward the impellers<br>
and away from the impeller axis a - a.<br>
Advection radially outward from the axis a - a preferentially affects heavy fractions,<br>
which, due to eddy centrifugation, are in high concentration in the boundary layer 30. Source flow<br>
therefore comprises high concentrations of heavy fractions. Once past the turbulent ring, the<br>
concentrated heavy fraction stream and its carbon dioxide, NOx, SOx, particulates, mercury, and<br>
injected liquid are churned in extreme turbulence in the expansion ring 25. Because nitrogen<br>
ballast is axially extracted through the radial vortices, scrubbing targets are concentrated in this<br>
turbulence. Gases produced by sorbent reactions are extracted away from the reaction zones at the<br>
turbulent vortex peripheries into the turbulent vortex axes. Precipitates and agglomerated aerosols<br>
are shear thickened into clumps, and the clumps snowball as they tumble in the turbulence,<br>
becoming larger clumps.<br>
Recirculation flow pressure 32 from the tank (not shown) and drag force from turbulent<br>
impedance of source flow oppose radially outward source flow between the impellers, but the<br>
heavy fractions gain enough momentum from the impellers to pass into the tank despite the<br>
 <br>
opposition. Said opposition preferentially adverts light fractions, which are in high concentration<br>
in the shear layer and therefore receive little momentum from the impellers.<br>
At the expansion ring 25 there is high turbulence between the impellers, which<br>
concentrates light fractions at vortex axes. The eddy vortices are low pressure gradients serving as<br>
capillaries for sink flow squeezed radially inward by the back pressure 32. The radial vortices<br>
collect the flow from the capillaries in the expansion ring as well as the mixing zones 22 of the<br>
turbulent ring 24 and the laminar ring 23.<br>
Sink flow through the axial exhaust port 9 and the axial exhaust conduit 10 comprises high<br>
concentrations of light fractions. The sink flow could become the feed for a second device of the<br>
same design, in a cascade, so as to purify the light fraction stream prior to discharge into the<br>
atmosphere. The preferred embodiment of the present invention is a simple, low-tech device<br>
easily scalable to separate high volume dirty hot waste gas streams.<br>
Figure 3b shows shows another cross-section of the work space 3 as seen from the impeller<br>
axis a - a. A boundary layer 30 is in contact with the surfaces of the impellers 4, 5, and boundary<br>
layer source flow is into the page due to impeller counter-rotation, shown by the arrows. Radial<br>
vortices 21 co-rotate clockwise as shown by arrows. The radial vortices are conduits for sink flow,<br>
out of the page. Adjacent vortices rotate counterclockwise, and smaller and smaller vortices<br>
appear between the radial vortices 21. The space between radial vortices is a mixing zone 22. All<br>
vortices, whether large or small, are driven by the forcing regime of the impellers and the axial<br>
pump.<br>
In the mixing zones 22 between the radial vortices, eddies, or fine-scale vortices, rotate in<br>
different directions, as shown. The complex vortex structure in the mixing zone 22 comprises<br>
shells and voids in a chaotic sponge; the representation in this drawing is merely a crude<br>
 <br>
7illustration of the complexity. In each vortex, radial stratification by density separates light from<br>
heavy fractions in the feed gas. Peripheries of adjacent turbulent eddy vortices grind together, thus<br>
contacting, pressuring, and mixing the heavy fractions, such as injected liquid and particulates,<br>
NOx, SOx, and condensible vapors. Slurry from mixing injected liquid with particulates and other<br>
aerosols shear thickens into clumps of sludge as the vortex peripheries grind on each other.<br>
Clumps tumbling in the turbulence agglomerate and adhere aerosols. Momentum of clumps<br>
advected radially outward assists source flow through the turbulent ring 24.<br>
Two simultaneous radial stratifications separate the feed gas: one in the vortices of<br>
turbulence, which are in a plane normal to the axis a - a , and another in source-sink flow with<br>
respect to the axis a - a. The combination of the two simultaneous radial stratifications causes<br>
differential radial advection of heavy and light fractions, with heavy fractions going radially<br>
outward from the impeller axis of rotation, and light fractions going radially inward through radial<br>
vortices. See Fig. 5.<br>
Figure 4 is a detail of the tank shown in Fig. 1. The interior of the tank 13 communicates<br>
with the work space 3 of the impeller assembly 19. The tank is pressurized by the impeller<br>
assembly 19, which forces fluid into the tank through the periphery 12. Seals 29 between the tank<br>
wall and the impellers 4,5 provide means for mamtaining the tank pressure and for isolating the<br>
tank interior from the atmosphere. Vanes 6 on the impellers 4,5 impel fluid into the tank and also<br>
create high shear in the tank. High shear in combination with back pressure 32 creates high<br>
turbulence and therefore causes excellent mixing of scrubbing targets with sorbents, and of fly ash<br>
with injected liquid.<br>
The flare section 18 of the impeller assembly forms a convergent nozzle which<br>
concentrates the recirculating flow pressure 32 into the shear layer between the impellers. The<br>
 <br>
back pressure squeezes sink flow through the vortices and increases residence time of heavy<br>
fractions in the turbulence.<br>
Flow through the periphery 12 into the tank 13 is a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide.<br>
Preferably, suitable cooling means 26 cool the tank walls. Said cooling means 26 could be of<br>
many types known to the art, including a water jacket connected to a brine chiller and means for<br>
circulation of brine through the water jacket and the chiller. A gas vent 27 emits a concentrated<br>
and pressurized stream of carbon dioxide out of the tank. A follow-on device of the same design<br>
shown in Fig. 1 accepts the output of the gas vent as its feed and further concentrates and cleans<br>
the carbon dioxide stream, if necessary.<br>
Liquids and solids passing through the periphery 12 along with the carbon dioxide collect<br>
at the bottom of the tank and pass through a purge pump 28 to disposal by suitable means.<br>
Figure 5 shows a cutaway side view of a radial vortex near the axial exhaust port 9 shown<br>
in Fig. 1 while the apparatus is in operation. The radial vortex axis b - b lies approximately in a<br>
plane normal to the axis a - a of the impellers and in a shear layer between the impellers. Were<br>
the radial vortex axis orientation other than parallel to the impellers, torque on the axis b - b from<br>
the counter-rotating impellers would twist it back into the plane of the shear layer. Exact counter-<br>
rotation of the impellers keeps the radial vortex axis approximately straight and normal to the axis<br>
a-a.<br>
The radial vortex 21 is a coherent structure in the turbulence forced by momentum<br>
transport from rotation of the impellers and by suction of an axial pump, in an open system. An<br>
array of radial vortices sets up in the shear layer as flow occurs through the apparatus shown in<br>
Fig. 1. The impellers and the axial pump stretch the radial vortex axis b - b.<br>
 <br>
Source flow, i.e. flow away from the axis a - a, is shown by the arrows pointing left. Sink<br>
flow, i.e. flow radially inward through the work space 3 toward the axis a - a, is shown by the<br>
arrows pointing right. Magnitude of the vectors is indicated by the length of the arrows. Both<br>
flows are helical about approximately the same axis of rotation b - b. Whether a fluid element<br>
(particle) flows radially inward or outward with respect to the axis a - a in the radial vortex<br>
depends on its distance from the radial vortex axis b - b. Particles distal to the axis b - b flow<br>
radially outward from the axis a - a in source flow, while particles proximal to the axis b - b flow<br>
radially inward toward the axis a - a in sink flow. Whether a particle is distal or proximal to the<br>
aXIS b - b is determined by its density. Radial fractionation of fluid fractions by density occurs<br>
within the radial vortex, and the radial fractionation determines whether the particle is advected<br>
radially inward or outward with respect to the axis a - a.<br>
Heavy fractions, including carbon dioxide, are centrifugated away from the axis b - b and<br>
are advected radially outward from the axis a - a in source flow. Carbon dioxide is captured in a<br>
tan!-' 13 in a gaseous state. The centrifugal impellers drive source flow.<br>
Light fractions, including nitrogen and water vapor, concentrate near the radial vortex axis<br>
b - b and are advected radially inward in sink flow. Pressure gradients drive sink flow, and the<br>
pressure gradients are created by the suction of an axial pump 11 as well as a back pressure 32.<br>
The radial vortex 21 is a sink flow conduit for light fractions to go to axial extraction<br>
through the axial exhaust port 9. A greater concentration of light fractions is in the sink flow than<br>
in the feed flow, leaving a concentrated stream of heavy fractions flowing away from the axis a -<br>
a. The light fractions are very much more by volume (&gt;85%) than the heavy fractions (
flue gas, so there is sufficient mass flow to sustain the coherence of the radial vortices.<br>
 <br>
As flow through the work space approaches the axial exhaust port 9, heavy fractions<br>
entrained in the flow are centrifugated out from the radial vortex axis b - b to the impellers where<br>
they join flow advected radially outward away from the axial exhaust port by contact with the top<br>
impeller 5 and the baffle 14 which act as centrifugal impellers.<br>
The forcing regime of differential radial advection creates helical counterflow (light<br>
fractions flowing in a tornado toward the axial exhaust port, heavy fractions flowing in an<br>
enveloping tornado away from it) about the axis b - b, which is source-sink flow with respect to<br>
the impeller axis a - a. Hence the name radial counterflow is applied to the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The density difference between carbon dioxide (44 g/mol) and nitrogen (28 g/mol) is 36%.<br>
Water vapor at 18 g/mol is even less dense than nitrogen, and the density difference between water<br>
vapor and carbon dioxide is 59 %. NOx and SOx are even denser than carbon dioxide, so the<br>
density difference between them and nitrogen is even more. Aerosols are much denser than said<br>
gases, so the density difference between aerosols, especially agglomerated particulates, and<br>
nitrogen gas is very very great. The denser the fluid fraction, the more distal it is from the axis b -<br>
b and the more it is advected radially outward from the axis a - a.<br>
Nitrogen, water vapor, and residual oxygen - the light fractions - predominate in sink flow<br>
toward the axial exhaust port 9. The net separation effect from the forcing regime should be<br>
evident from the foregoing discussion and may be determined more exactly by experiment or<br>
computation by those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
The radial vortex exists in an open system, i.e. a system having material flow in and out<br>
more or less continuously. It is therefore distinguishable from the radial vortices which appear<br>
under certain conditions in closed system von Karman swirling flow. Sustained coherent vortices<br>
 <br>
even in highly turbulent flow are possible because the system is open. The red spot of Jupiter is<br>
one example.<br>
Figure 6 shows an alternative embodiment for flue gas scrubbing, comprising a single<br>
centrifugal impeller 41 having vanes 6 on both sides and disposed within a casing 35. A drive<br>
spindle 42 connected to a motor 7 and connected to the casing through a bearing seal 39 causes the<br>
centrifugal impeller 41 to rotate within the casing 35 and thereby to advect feed gas from a source<br>
la through an axial feed conduit 1 and into the casing.<br>
Scrubbing liquid from a source 20 is injected through an injection port 16 into the feed gas.<br>
The scrubbing liquid mixes with the feed gas in high turbulence caused by shear of the fluid<br>
between the impeller and the casing.<br>
A tank 13 at the periphery of the casing receives flow advected by the impeller. Rotation<br>
of the impeller 41 creates a recirculation flow pressure or back pressure 32 shown by the right-<br>
pointing arrow which is in a direction pointing toward the impeller axis of rotation. The tank<br>
comprises a gas vent 27 for evacuating carbon dioxide and a purge pump 28 for evacuating<br>
condensates, liquid, and solids. Pressure within the tank is caused by the impeller 41 driving fluid<br>
into the tank, and pressure causes mercury, NOx and SOx to condense and flow through the purge<br>
pump.<br>
The recirculation flow pressure 32 provides means for advection of light fractions in sink<br>
flow radially inward toward the impeller axis a - a and into an axial exhaust conduit 10<br>
communicating with an axial pump 11. The axial pump is preferably a steam ejector/eductor<br>
powered by blowdown. The axial pump sucks light fractions through the axial exhaust conduit.<br>
Thus light fractions including nitrogen, water vapor, and residual oxygen are axially extracted<br>
from the flue gas within the casing, thereby increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the tank 13.<br>
 <br>
Shear in the work space 3 between the impeller vanes 6 and the casing 35 causes high<br>
turbulence and many fine-scale eddy vortices in the work space 3. At the axes of all vortices are<br>
low pressure gradients. In each vortex, light fractions concentrate at the vortex axes, and heavy<br>
fractions are centrifugated to the vortex periphery. Adjacent vortices grind together at their<br>
peripheries, causing contact of liquid with scrubbing targets and shear thickening of scrubbing<br>
slurry.<br>
Radial stratification by density takes place in each of the fine-scale eddy vortices, and<br>
recirculation flow pressure 32 drives light fractions radially inward along the eddy vortex axes and<br>
eventually into the axial exhaust conduit 10. The net effect of innumerable fine-scale vortices<br>
working in unison is to separate heavy from light fractions. This net effect is harnessed by<br>
differential radial advection forced by the axial pump 11 and the centrifugal impeller 41. Both the<br>
axial pump and the recirculation flow pressure drive sink flow.<br>
The axial pump is only one means for driving sink flow, and recirculation flow pressure<br>
alone could be sufficient. However, for large scale gas separation such as flue gas at power plants,<br>
where abundant blowdown steam is available for steam ejectors, and the volume of nitrogen and<br>
other light fractions to be extracted is very large, an axial pump is a preferable feature.<br>
Flow between the impeller 41 and the casing 35 radially inward to the axial exhaust conduit<br>
10 will be very turbulent due to shear in the fluid between the impeller and the casing. However,<br>
there is a macroscopic forcing which organizes the behavior of fluid in this space. Next to the<br>
impeller 41 is a boundary layer which is advected radially outward from the axis a - a by impeller<br>
rotation. Recirculation flow pressure 32 and the suction of the axial pump 11 drive light fractions<br>
radially inward along the casing into the axial exhaust conduit 10. By the time gas reaches the<br>
axial exhaust port 9 it will have a higher concentration of nitrogen and water vapor than the gas<br>
 <br>
passing through the axial feed port 2. Thus nitrogen and water vapor are axially extracted from<br>
flue gas, leaving a concentrated carbon dioxide stream emitted through the gas vent 27.<br>
Figure 7a shows the preferred drive means for causing counter-rotation of centrifugal<br>
impellers 4, 5 of the impeller assembly 19. A drive wheel 38 connected by a drive spindle 37 to a<br>
drive motor 36 engages the impellers at their periphery. The drive spindle goes through the tank<br>
wall and the tank and drive spindle are separated by a movable seal. A transmission (not shown)<br>
connected to the motor and the drive spindle provides means for high startup torque. Preferably,<br>
on startup of the preferred embodiment, the tank is allowed to vent freely and remain<br>
unpressurized, and the impellers, which have high rotational inertia, are gradually brought up to<br>
speed before feed is introduced and the tank pressure increased by closing the gas vent 27.<br>
Preferably, the drive wheel has a non-slip surface such that there is high friction between<br>
the drive wheel and the impellers. Shown is a surface having a variety of angular protrusions in<br>
different orientations. Another alternative is cogs which fit into grooves in the impellers, the<br>
imr&gt;eller grooves being unobstructed channels for flow of sludge radially outward and into the<br>
tank. Other suitable means for increasing the friction between the drive wheel and the impellers<br>
include rubber and abrasive surfaces. Rotation of the drive wheel drives the impellers in opposite<br>
directions at the same angular velocity. The drive spindle engages the tank 13 at a bearing seal 39.<br>
The drive wheel provides means for maintaining the impellers at a certain separation distance.<br>
Figure 7b shows a top view of the preferred embodiment, comprising three equidistantly<br>
spaced preferred counter-rotation drive means of Fig. 7a. Three or more drive units provide means<br>
for maintaining the impellers separated, and more units are preferable so that if one unit breaks<br>
during operation, it may be put into free wheeling mode until repair can be done.<br>
 <br>
Having the benefit in hindsight of instruction provided by the above detailed description of<br>
the present invention, and the exposition of the problem to be solved and the prior art, those skilled<br>
in the art of emissions control or centrifugal gas separation will see obvious modifications which<br>
may be made to the invention. It is not intended that the admitted possibility of such future<br>
modifications should imply any admission by the inventor that the best mode for practicing the<br>
invention has not been disclosed. The best mode presently known to the inventor for the particular<br>
application to flue gas concentration and scrubbing has been disclosed. Future improvements or<br>
modifications by others should not alter or nullify the effect of the claims.<br>
Nor should instructed hindsight on the pan of those of more than ordinary skill in the<br>
particular art affected by the present invention be admitted as ex post facto evidence to the effect<br>
that the present invention was obvious or that they could easily have conceived it had they<br>
bothered, when the serious problem of flue gas pollution and global warming has remained<br>
unsolved by so many for so long.<br>
Obviously, cascading devices according to the present invention would improve collection<br>
efficiency. In other words, the light fraction stream coming from the axial exhaust conduit 10 is<br>
fed into a second device and separated further, and so on, until the light fraction stream is ready for<br>
discharge or for use. Also, the heavy fraction stream coming from the tank vent 27 is made the<br>
feed for a second device, etc.<br>
It should also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in various other arts what particular<br>
application may be made given the disclosure in the present invention. Dry scrubbing as well as<br>
wet scrubbing is included. Dry particulate matter coheres by van der Waals forces due to<br>
numerous inelastic collisions in a highly turbulent environment with gas being continuously<br>
extracted so as to remove the envelope of gas particles from the scrubbing targets. Many<br>
 <br>
applications to separation of fluid mixtures other than flue gas are possible and should be obvious,<br>
along with necessary modifications.<br>
For example, natural gas scrubbing could be accomplished by the present invention, with<br>
methane being the light fraction axially extracted, and hydrogen sulfide, condensible vapors,<br>
carbon dioxide, and water being among the heavy fractions advected radially outward to<br>
compression in a tank and scrubbed in high turbulence.<br>
Vacuum cleaners using axially-fed counter-rotating centrifugal impellers would exhaust<br>
gas and agglomerate even fine dry particles by van der Waals forces in highly turbulent<br>
at the impeller periphery.<br>
Improved air cleaners for mine or building ventilation are another obvious application of<br>
the teachings herein. Therefore, it is not intended that the scope of the invention be limited to the<br>
specific embodiments described, which are merely illustrative of the present invention, i.e. the<br>
disclosed apparatus and method for radial counterflow gas separation and highly turbulent<br>
scrubbing, and not intended to have the effect of limiting the scope of the claims except as<br>
specifically stated in the claims.<br>

This is an appratus for separating gases or other fluids into heavy and light components via radial counterflow<br>
currents. A tank contains an axis, upon which a pair of motorized impeller plates rotate in opposite directions to direct heavy fluids<br>
downward and lighter fluids upward. Lighter fluids are pumped out of the tank into the environment Heavier fluids are pumped<br>
out and collected beneath the tank. The impellers notably comprise vanes to more precisely direct the currents. The impellers flare<br>
outward relative to the axis of rotation, increasing centrifugal force separating heavy from light components.<br>
