				<td>The present invention relates to a device useful for safe deployment and retrieval of experimental panels having microfouling and corrosion samples in deep marine water.<br>
The device will be useful for the deployment and retrieval of experimental coupons in a closed casing in deep marine waters. Thus it will help to provide efficient and precision technique for collection of undisturbed samples of corrosion and microfouling from deep marine waters.<br>
There is no device presently available in the world which is useful for safe<br>
r<br>
deployment and retrieval of experimental coupons from deep marine waters.<br>
However, presently the coupons for corrosion and microfoulng studies are being deployed and retrieved from deep waters without being protected from sloughing off of corrosion product and microfouling. Reference may be made to Wagh, A.B.; Sawant, S.S.; Venugopalan, V.P.; Raveendran, T.V. and Bhat, L.K. 1988. A device to study biofouling and corrosion from fixed offshore platforms. Corros. Prev. Contr. 35(5); 134-137.; Bhosle, N.B.; Nandakumar, k.; Venkat, K.; Dhople, V.; Sawant, S.S.; Kelkar, P.G. and Wagh, A.B. 1989. Biological and biochemical characterization of microfouling on aluminium panels placed in the Arabian Sea. Indian Nation. Sci. Acad. 55; 51 - 56.; Sawant, S.S. and Wagh, A.B. 1990. Corrosion behavior of metals and alloys in the deep waters of Arabian Sea. Corros. Prev. contr. 37; 151-168.; Sawant, S.S.; venkat, K. and Wagh, A.B. 1993. Corrosion of metals and alloys in the coastal and deep waters of the Arabian sea and the Bay of Bengal. Indian J. Tech. 31; 862-866.; Sawant S.S.; Venkat, K. and Wagh, A.B. 1994. Cathodic protection of mild steel and copper in deep waters of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Indian J. Chem. Tech. 1; 279-282, wherein experimental coupons are attached to metallic or non-metallic frames and lowered and retrieved from predetermined depth with the help of a wire rope or a deep sea mooring system. These operations are performed either from a offshore platform or onboard research vessels. During the process of lowering and retrieval, the coupons travel through water column and in doing so the surface<br><br>
deposits and microfouling assemblage from the panels will get disturbed due to friction against the water leading to erroneous results. The drawbacks of these techniques are, sloughing off of corrosion product and microfouling from the surfaces of experimental coupons due to friction against the surrounding water during retrieval process. This will lead to under estimation of corrosion and microfouling in deep waters. However, the proposed device is meant for overcoming this drawback.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for safe deployment and retrieval of experimental panel having microfouling and corrosion samples from deep marine waters, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an efficient and precision device by which data on microfouling and corrosion could be collected from deep marine waters.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification, Figure-1 represents the longitudinal section of the general assembly of the device, wherein, all the various parts have been shown. Figure-2 of the accompanying drawings represents first step of operation, wherein, the coupons are out of the casing after the messenger triggers the weitht release system. Figure-3 of the a ccompanying drawings represent second step of the operation, wherein the coupons go back into the casing after the second messenger triggers the weight release system.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for safe deployment and retrieval of experimental panels having microfouling and corrosion samples in deep marine water which comprises a cylindrical experimental panel holding casing (1), housing a seal ring (2) in a grove provided on the upper end of the said casing (1), a lid (3) being provided as an attachment means for the experimental panel holder (4), a bottom cover plate (5) being fixed to said casing (1) with an "0" ring (6) by a plurality of screws (7,8,9), the above assembly (1 - 9) as a unit being placed inside a bottom steel ring (10), a pulley (11) being mounted<br><br>
centrally over the lid (3), a top steel ring (12) carrying another pulley (13) on its peripheral lower side, a spring loaded trigger block (14) being welded to steel ring (12), a plurality of spring loaded "L" pins (15 &amp; 16) being housed inside the trigger block (14) with springs (17 &amp; 18) respectively, a lower wire block (19) being laterally welded to bottom steel ring (10), a plurality of bolts ( 20, 21 &amp; 22) being fastened to (12) from top and (10) from bottom running through the three guide holes provided in (3) and a nylon cord (23) looped at one end being engaged to the "L" pin, (16) running over the pulley (11), and then looped again into engage with "L" pin, (15) and then passing through second pulley (13), and carrying a dead weight (24) at the other end, the device being clamped to a wire rope (25) with the help of clamp bolts ( 26 &amp; 27), wherein first messenger, (28), slides onto wire rope (25) and the second messenger, (29), following subsequently.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the materials to be used for experimental panel holder casing, lid and bottom cover plate and pulleys is selected from HDPE, PVC, Nylon, Delrin, Fiber glass, Plastic, LDPE, Teflon, Ceramic or any other type of non-conductive and non-corrosive inert material.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the other parts such as bottom ring, top ring, wire clamping blocks, "L" pins, clamp bolts, tie bolts, messengers and dead weight may be made of stainless steel 316 , Brass, Titanium or any other metal and alloys which is resistive to seawater corrosion.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the size of the device may vary depending upon the size and number of experimental coupons.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the size and the weight of the dead weight may vary and is higher than the total weight of the experimental coupon assembly.<br><br>
The invention is discussed and illustrated in detail as given below but the said disclosure should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The device consisting of experimental panel holder casing, panel holder, lid, pins, nylon cord, dead weight, clamping bolts are assembled as shown in Figure-1. Fix the experimental panel to holder and screw the holder to the lid. The sample holder casing is screwed to the bottom cover plate by means of three screw with a seal ring in between. The seal ring is inserted inside the grove provided at the upper end of the sample holder casing. This assembly is slid inside the bottom steel ring. The top steel ring is clamped to the bottom steel ring by means of the tie bolts which pass through the three guide holes provided in the lid. Now, the end loop of the nylon cord is attached to the spring loaded "L" pin 16, and runs over the pulley on top of the lid and once again it is looped and engaged to the "L" pin 15, and then passed over the pulley 13, and a dead weight 24, is attached to the other end. The entire assembly is clamped to the wire rope with the help of clamp bolts 27, to the triggering block 14, and lower wire block 19. The sample holder casing is filled with sterile water. The sample holder casing is closed with lid which sits on the seal ring from the top side. The device along with coupons is lowered by means of a attached wire rope to the pre-determined water depth. The first messenger is than sent from onboard the vessel/platform, which triggers the "L" pin 15, and releases the loop, effecting the dead weight to move downward and lifting the lid along with the coupons. Thus, the coupons are exposed to the surrounding seawater. After the pre-determined exposure period the second messenger 29, is sent down over the wire rope which triggers the "L" pin 16, effecting the release of end loop and causes the free fall of the dead weight along with the cord. This results in the sending down of the lid along with the coupons by the gravitational force. This ensures the coupons to be retained back into the casing. Now the device is hauled up onboard vessel/platform, at any speed which will not effect the experimental coupons within the casing. The<br><br>
coupons are removed from the holder and analyzed for the assessment of corrosion and microfouling.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	It is fully mechanical and does not depend on any energy source.<br>
2.	It allows the experimental coupons to remain safe inside the casing<br>
during the course of lowering and retrieval. It allows the coupons to<br>
come out of the casing and get exposed to the surrounding water at the<br>
pre-determined water depth.<br>
3.	The device can be opened and closed in in-situ condition by two<br>
operations, which is a unique mechanical technique.<br>
4.	The coupons do not come in contact with water column, thus the effect<br>
of friction between the panel and water is avoided during lowering as<br>
well as retrieval.<br>
5.	The device is very simple in construction and operation.<br>
6.	The results obtained on the assessment of corrosion and microfouling<br>
are highly reliable, authentic and error free.<br><br><br><br>
