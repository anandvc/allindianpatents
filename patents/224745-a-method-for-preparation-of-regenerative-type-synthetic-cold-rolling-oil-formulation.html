				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Introduction in the Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to method of preparation of regenerative type synthetic/semi-<br>
synthetic rolling oil for cold rolling of thin gauge sheet of steel and its formulation.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
Cold rolling operation involves gauge reduction of hot rolled strip by passing it through a set<br>
of rolls under load. Cold rolling oil is mainly used for lubrication and cooling during cold<br>
rolling operation. In general, a cold rolling lubrication system uses oils in form of oil-in-<br>
water emulsion. This emulsion is applied at the roll bite; used emulsion is then filtered for<br>
various contaminants and then re-circulated in the same system for continuous usage over<br>
a protracted period of time. In cases where the cold rolling mill is not equipped with re-<br>
circulation type emulsion system, used oil is regenerated for its further use.<br>
It is already known to prepare dispersion type cold rolling oil for steel cold rolling mills.<br>
However, it was not known to prepare synthetic/semi-synthetic dispersion type oil with<br>
regeneration property.<br>
The cold rolling oil dispersion has to meet various requirements like optimum lubricity, high<br>
cooling efficiency, optimum emulsion stability, high cleanliness etc. For a cold rolling mill,<br>
which is having recuperative type emulsion system to regenerate the used oil for higher<br>
techno-economics, the rolling oil should have good regeneration property.<br>
Though, the presently available dispersion/emulsion type rolling oils comprising<br>
fats/synthetic organic esters, Extreme pressure(EP) / Anti-wear(AW) additives, detergent<br>
/emulsifier etc., can meet most of the requirements of lubrication for cold rolling, but they<br>
do not have the regeneration property due to the presence of detergent /emulsifier etc.<br>
Naturally available palm oils which sometimes are therefore used as regenerative type<br>
lubricant but they suffer from limitations like lack desirable properties such as improper<br>
dispersion, low load bearing capacity, high consumption of lubricant etc.<br>
In general, any emulsifiable cold rolling oil formulation consists of natural fats/triglycerides<br>
or synthetic esters, or combination of both, along with other additives such as emulsifiers,<br>
load bearing additives, antioxidants, detergents and biocides. Such oils form fairly stable<br>
emulsion under agitation and hence were not found to be suitable for usage in the subject<br>
mill since this could not be recovered in the system designed specifically for palm oil. With<br>
the usage of palm oil, following problems were being faced in the subject mill:<br>
a. Improper dispersion leading to uneven oil plate-out on the strip resulting in<br>
improper lubrication, generation of stain/patches on rolled strips, and high oil<br>
consumption.<br>
b. Due to part emulsification, recovery percentage of palm oil was very low (below<br>
50%).<br>
c. Palm oil being a high titer fat, energy consumption was higher in the mixing<br>
tanks.<br>
d. Palm oil alone could not bear the high load cold rolling operation is done with.<br>
This resulted in frequent strip breakage and poor surface quality.<br>
Thus, there was a persistent need for development of highly economical balanced dispersion<br>
type rolling oil for cold rolling application devoid of any emulsifier and having desired<br>
regeneration property.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
Thus, it is the basic object of this invention to prepare dispersion type rolling oil for use in<br>
the cold rolling of thin gauge sheet of steel, which will have all the properties of a<br>
satisfactory dispersion but without use of emulsifying agent/detergent and also have the<br>
regeneration property.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to providing a selective base fluid<br>
formulation comprising lubricant selected from triglycerides of oleic acid / palmitic acid<br>
enriched materials preferably karanja, palm and groundnut, mineral oil in the viscosity<br>
range 30 to 70 cst at 40°C, polyol esters including esters of C8-C18:0,l,2,3 carboxylic acids<br>
and bis, tri and tetra alcohol with other conventional ingredients provided such as to<br>
disperse completely in water phase with oil droplet size in the range from 3 -15 urn, under<br>
high agitation and at 50° to 70°C temperature which can be recuperated after use.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to preparation of regenerative type<br>
synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein the conventional ingredients are preferably<br>
selected from dispersants, wetting agents, antioxidants, biocides, EP/AW additives.<br>
It is yet another objects to propose dispersion type oil, which maintains its physical<br>
properties and chemical characteristics over a long period of time and can ensure uniform<br>
results.<br>
Brief Statement of the Invention:<br>
The basic aspect of the present invention is therefore directed to a method for preparation<br>
of regenerative type synthetic/semi-synthetic cold rolling oil formulation cornprfsing:<br>
providing a selective base fluid formulation comprising lubricant selected from triglycerides<br>
of oleic acid / palmitic acid enriched materials preferably rapeseed, palm and groundnut,<br>
mineral oil in the viscosity range 30 to 70 cst at 40°C, polyol esters including esters of C8-<br>
C18:0,l,2,3 carboxylic acids and bis, tri and tetra alcohol with other conventional<br>
ingredients provided such as to disperse completely in water phase with oil droplet size in<br>
the range from 3 -15 µm, under high agitation and at 50° to 70°C temperature which can be<br>
recuperated after use.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein the conventional ingredients<br>
are preferably selected from dispersants, wetting agents, antioxidants, biocides, Extreme<br>
Pressure(EP)/Anti-Wear(AW) additives.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of regenerative<br>
type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein the triglycerides are used at weight<br>
concentration of 20 to 50% and polyol esters are used at weight concentration of 10 to 80%<br>
and preferably 20 to 50%.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein dispersants are selected<br>
such as to disperse the triglycerides/polyol esters in water under mechanical agitation and<br>
are preferably selected from primary/secondary amines with C4-C22 chain length and<br>
monocarboxylic fatty acids with C3 to C12 chain length.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein the dispersants are used at a<br>
weight concentration of 0.5 to 3%.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein antioxidants were selected<br>
from stearically hindered butylated para cresylic acid, secondary biphenyl amines and the<br>
weight concentration of antioxidant is in the range of 0.05 to 1.0%.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation wherein EP/AW additives are selected<br>
from sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus based and alkylated zinc compounds with N, P and these<br>
are incorporated in the range of 0.1 to 5%.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention directed to a method for preparation of<br>
regenerative type synthetic cold rolling oil formulation as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 7<br>
wherein selected biocides are based on methylated, butylated isothiazolon derivatives and<br>

is selected from (a) 2-5% for galvanizing and sheet gauge steels and (b) 3-6%<br>
for tin-plate steel ; and<br>
(ii) the oil concentration for emulsion system between the stands 4-5 is selected<br>
from (a) 1-1.5% for galvanizing and sheet gauge steel and (b) 1-2% for tin-plate<br>
steel.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention directed tosaid regenerative type synthetic oil<br>
of the present invention as the known regenerative dispersion type oils are derived from<br>
natural oils (e.g. palm oil) and thus contain many undesirable constituents, and involves<br>
preparing a dispersion type oil based on synthetic esters and some natural oils to suit cold<br>
rolling application purposes. The present oil emulsion could be beneficially employed as<br>
hydrodynamic/boundary lubricants with other ingredients to prepare a suitable dispersion<br>
type oil.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention is that the known method of preparation of oil<br>
and its dispersion could not be employed due to the change in the natures and behaviors of<br>
the ingredients and as such the subject cold rolling mill was designed to use dispersion<br>
based on Palm oil as the lubricant. Herein, a dispersion of oil-in-water is prepared by<br>
agitation at high speed in mixing tanks at elevated temperature (ranging between 50-90°<br>
C). The dispersion thus prepared is applied directly on the strip in between the stands for<br>
lubrication. The used dispersion is then pumped to a recovery system for recovering the<br>
used oil out of the dispersion for reuse in the same system.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the recovery process comprises of skimming, hot<br>
water washing and two-stage centrifuging to remove various contaminants and separate oil<br>
from water.<br>
The present invention its objects and advantages are described in further details with<br>
reference to accompanying non-limiting illustrative examples.<br>
Further Details of the Invention:<br>
The work on subject invention was taken up to overcome above listed shortcomings of palm<br>
oil. The developed oil is so designed to disperse uniformly under high agitation in water<br>
phase at temperature range of 50-70° C to a droplet size range of 3-15µm. This uniform<br>
dispersion is then applied on the strips by means of nozzles. The used dispersion separated<br>
rapidly under stationary condition and the oil is recovered in the recovery system for reuse.<br>
With the usage of this oil, increased recovery (up to 70%), better strip finish, lower oil<br>
consumption, lower energy consumption, and decreased frequency of strip breakage were<br>
achieved.<br>
The present invention features composition of cold rolling oil for steel, which includes<br>
hydrodynamic/boundary lubricants, dispersants, wetting agents, anti-oxidants, mineral oils,<br>
biocides, Extreme Pressure(EP)/Anti-Wear(AW) additives.<br>
In this invention, for hydrodynamic/boundary lubrication, raw materials were selected from<br>
triglycerides of oleic acid/palmitic acid enriched materials like rapeseed, palm, and<br>
groundut; mineral oils in the viscosity range 30-70 cSt at 40°C; Polyol esters including<br>
esters of C8-C18:o, 1,2,3 carboxylic acids and bis, tri and tetra alcohol. Triglycerides were used<br>
at weight concentration of 20 to 50% and polyol esters at weight concentration of 20 to<br>
50%. Dispersants were used to disperse the triglycerides/polyol esters in water under<br>
mechanical agitation. Same were selectd from primary/secondary amines with C4-C22 chain<br>
length and monocarboxylic fatty acids with C3 to C12 chain length. Dispersants were used at<br>
a weight concentration of 0.5 to 3%. Monocarboxylic fatty acids were used at a weight<br>
concentration of 0.5% to 3%.<br>
Antioxidants were selected from stearically hindered butylated para cresylic acid, secondary<br>
biphenyl amines. Weight concentration of antioxidant was in the range of 0.05 to 1.0%.<br>
EP/AW additives were selected from sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus based and alkylated<br>
zinc compounds with N, P. These were incorporated in the range of 0.1 to 5%. Selected<br>
biocides were based on methylated, butylated iso-thiazolon derivatives and triazines. This<br>
was added in the range of weight concentration ranging from 0.1 to 1.0%.<br>
The invention also suggests the desired emulsion parameters for different emulsion systems<br>
and grades of steel. It further recommends the process conditions to be maintained for<br>
better ease of regeneration. These parameters are summarized below for a typical 5-stand<br>
Tandem Mill:<br>
• Oil concentration for emulsion system in between stands 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4:<br>
a. 2-5% for galvanizing and sheet gauge steels<br>
b. 3-6% for tin-plate steel<br>
• Oil concentration for emulsion system in between stands 4-5:<br>
a. 1-1.5% for galvanizing and sheet gauge steels<br>
b. 1-2% for tin-plate steel<br>
• Dispersion temperature: 50-70°C<br>
• Oil particle size: 3-15<br>
• Temperature of oil during regeneration: 80-90° C<br>
The dispersion according to the present invention, can be made stable at room temperature<br>
under high agitation. It can also be stored at this condition; however, its life will be less<br>
(say 2 months). It can be stored in tanks for higher life (over 4 months) at elevated<br>
temperature (50-70° C) and agitated conditions. At stationary condition, there shall be<br>
separation of oil from the aqueous phase and during storage there can be generation of<br>
