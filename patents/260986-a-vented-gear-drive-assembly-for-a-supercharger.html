VENTED GEAR DRIVE ASSEMBLY FOR A SUPERCHARGER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a vented gear drive assembly for a<br>
compressor or supercharger.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	It is known in the art to utilize positive displacement compressors, such<br>
as roots-type and screw -type compressors, having lobed rotors for supercharging<br>
internal combustion engines and for providing compressed air for other purposes. Such<br>
a compressor, when used as an automotive supercharger, may include a housing having<br>
a rotor cavity in which a pair of rotors, having interleaved lobes, rotates to transport<br>
volumes of intake air between an inlet passage of the housing and an outlet passage of<br>
the housing thereby increasing the pressure at the outlet passage.<br>
[0003]	Sustained high load operation of the supercharger increases the air<br>
temperature exiting the supercharger, with the highest temperatures typically reached at<br>
high engine speeds and supercharger loads. The air tends to heat lubricating oil within<br>
a gear drive assembly of the supercharger by forced convection/conduction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	A gear drive assembly for a supercharger assembly is provided. The<br>
gear drive assembly includes at least one gear member rotatable about an axis of<br>
rotation. A cover member is operable to substantially enclose the at least one gear<br>
member. A tube member extends through the cover member and is positioned<br>
substantially adjacent to the at least one gear member and is generally aligned along the<br>
axis of rotation. The cover member at least partially defines a volume within which a<br>
predetermined amount of lubricating oil is disposed. The tube member is positioned<br>
above the predetermined amount of lubricating oil when the at least one gear member is<br><br>
P000549-PTE-KFB<br>
2<br>
not rotating and is operable to vent the gear drive assembly. A supercharger assembly<br>
incorporating the gear drive assembly is also disclosed.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure lisa bottom view of a supercharger assembly adapted for use with<br>
an internal combustion engine;<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a cross sectional perspective view of a portion of the<br>
supercharger assembly taken along Line Z-Z of Figure 1, illustrating a gear drive<br>

[0009]	Figure 4 is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of a cover<br>
member for use with the gear drive assembly of Figure 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
compressor or supercharger assembly, generally indicated at 10. The supercharger<br>
assembly 10 is adapted for use with an internal combustion engine, not shown, and is<br>
operable to increase the volumetric efficiency thereof. The supercharger 10 may be a<br>
roots-type or screw-type supercharger. The supercharger assembly includes a housing<br>
12. The housing 12 is preferably formed from cast metal such as, for example,<br>
aluminum, magnesium, etc. The housing 12 includes a first end 14 and an opposed<br>
second end 16. A supercharger drive assembly 18 is mounted with respect to the first end<br>
14 of the housing 12, while a gear drive assembly 20 is mounted with respect to the<br>
second end 16 of the housing 12. The supercharger drive assembly 18 includes a shaft<br><br>
P000549-PTE-KFB<br>
3<br>
mounted pulley 22 configured to receive a belt, not shown, thereon to transmit driving<br>
force from the internal combustion engine to the supercharger assembly 10. Positioned<br>
substantially adjacent to the supercharger drive assembly 18 is an inlet duct 24 operable<br>
to convey intake air, indicated by arrow 26, into the housing 12 of the supercharger<br>
assembly 10.<br>
[0011]	The gear drive assembly 20 is operable to maintain rotational timing<br>
between a pair of interleaved, counter rotating rotor assemblies 28, one of which is shown<br>
in Figure 2. The gear drive assembly includes a bearing support member 30 mounted to<br>
said housing 12, while a cover member 32 is mounted to the bearing support member 30.<br>
The cover member 32 and bearing support member 30 are removably mounted with<br>
respect to the housing 12 by a plurality of fasteners 34. The cover member 32 and<br>
bearing support member 30 are preferably formed from metal such as, for example,<br>
aluminum, magnesium, steel, etc. A tube member 36 extends through the cover member<br>
32 and is operable to vent the gear drive assembly 20 to the atmosphere 38. The tube<br>
member 36 is preferably held within the cover member 32 by interference fit or adhesive<br>
bonding; however, other methods may be employed to retain the tube member 36 with<br>
respect to the cover member 32 while remaining within the scope of that which is<br>
claimed. The construction and operation of the gear drive assembly 20 will be discussed<br>
in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to Figures 2 through 4.<br>
[0012]	Referring now to Figure 2 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there<br>
is shown a sectional view of the gear drive assembly 20 of Figure 1. The gear drive<br>
assembly 20 includes a gear member 40 mounted to a shaft member 42 for unitary<br>
rotation therewith. The shaft member 42 rotatably supports the rotor assembly 28 within<br>
the housing 12, shown in Figure 1. As such, the gear member 40 and rotor assembly 28<br>
rotate unitarily. The gear member 40 is provided in meshing engagement with another<br>
gear member, not shown, and together operates to maintain rotational timing between<br>
rotor assemblies 28 within the supercharger assembly 10. The gear member 40 has an<br>
axis of rotation 44. The tube member 36 is generally aligned with the axis of rotation 44<br>
of the gear member 40. The tube member 36 includes an end portion 46 positioned<br>
substantially adjacent to the gear member 40. In a preferred embodiment, the shaft<br><br>
P000549-PTE-KFB<br>
4<br>
member 42 defines a recess 48 within which the end portion 46 of the tube member 36 is<br>
at least partially received.<br>
[0013]	The cover member 32 partially defines a volume 50 within which a<br>
predetermined amount of lubricating oil 52 is contained. With the gear member 40 at<br>
rest, or not rotating, the lubricating oil 52 has a fill level, indicated by the phantom line<br>
54. The end portion 46 of the tube member 36 is positioned above the fill level 54 so as<br>
to prevent the leakage of lubricating oil 52 via the tube member 36.<br>
[0014]	During operation of the supercharger assembly 10, heating of the<br>
lubricating oil 52 occurs as a function of supercharger load and duration of operation.<br>
This temperature rise will tend to increase the pressure within the volume 50 which, if<br>
left unregulated, may damage seals, not shown, within the gear drive assembly 20. The<br>
tube member 36 operates to vent pressure within the volume 50 to the atmosphere 38<br>
thereby maintaining acceptable pressure limits within the volume 50. As the gear<br>
member 40 rotates in the direction as indicated by arrow 55, any lubricating oil 52<br>
thereon will be forced radially outward, away from the axis of rotation 44 of the gear<br>
member 40, thereby preventing the lubricating oil from traversing the tube member 36.<br>
[0015]	Referring to Figure 3 and with continued reference to Figure 2, there is<br>
shown an alternate embodiment of the cover member 32, generally indicated at 32A. The<br>
cover member 32A includes a plurality of projections 56, which extend axially from an<br>
inner wall 58 of the cover member 32A toward the gear member 40 of Figure 2. The<br>
projections 56 cooperate to form a plurality of radially outwardly extending channels 60<br>
operable to channel or direct lubricating oil 52 from the axis of rotation 44 of the gear<br>
member 40, as indicated by arrows 62. The projections 56 are preferably curved in the<br>
direction of rotation of the gear member 40 such that the channels 60 are generally<br>
curved in the direction of rotation of the gear member 40, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
[0016]	Referring to Figure 4 and with continued reference to Figure 2, there is<br>
shown an alternate embodiment of the cover members 32 of Figure 2 and 32A of Figure<br>
3, generally indicated at 32B. The cover member 32B includes a projecting wall 64,<br>
which extends axially from the inner wall 58 of the cover member 32B toward the gear<br>
member 40 of Figure 2. The projecting wall 64 defines a generally outwardly spiraling<br><br>
P000549-PTE-KFB<br>
5<br>
channel 66 in the direction of rotation of the gear member 40. The channel 66 is operable<br>
to substantially prevent the lubricating oil 52 from traversing the axis of rotation 44 of<br>
the gear member 40.<br>
[0017]	By venting the gear drive assembly 20 via the tube member 36, the<br>
increase in temperature and pressure within the volume 50 under sustained high load<br>
operation of the supercharger assembly 10 may be reduced. The positioning of the tube<br>
member 36 is effective in preventing or substantially limiting the loss of lubricating oil<br>
52 through the tube member 36.<br>
[0018]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
