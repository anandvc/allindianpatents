The present  invention  is  concerned with  a process  for  carrying  out  a condensation reaction in the presence of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate of the formula<br><br>
as a protonic acid catalyst in condensation reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts condensations, vinyl ether condensations of acetals with vinyl or propenyi ethers (for the production of intermediates in carotenoid syntheses) and acylations of phenols.<br>
The  reaction  of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-naphthalen-l-yl benzoate with isophytol to give 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(3,7,11, 1 5-tetramethyl-hexadec-2-enyl)-naphthalen-1-yl   benzoate (dihydro-vitamin Ki monobenzoate) and of trimethylhydroquinone with isophytol to give d,l-a-tocopherol (vitamin E) can be mentioned as examples of Friedel-Crafts condensations, the reaction of acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal or (E)-1,1,4,4-tetramethoxy-but-2-ene with methyl propenyi ether or of 1 3-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexen-1 -yl)-2,7,1 1 -trimethyl-trideca-2,6,8,10,12-pentaen-4-yn-1-al diethyl acetal with ethyl vinyl ether can be mentioned as examples of vinyl ether condensations of acetals with vinyl or propenyi ethers for the production of intermediates in carotenoid syntheses, and the production of d,l-a-tocopherol acetate from d,l-a-tocopherol can be mentioned as an example of acylations of phenols.<br>
Various processes for performing Friedel-Crafts condensations have already been described in the literature and are carried out using protonic acids, such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid, trichloroacetic acid and the like, Lewis acids, such as aluminium chloride, boron trifluoride, iron chloride, zinc chloride and the like, or mixtures of the two types of acid, such<br><br>
as a mixture of zinc chloride and a strong protonic acid and the like, as catalysts.<br>
All of these previously known processes have serious disadvantages: thus, corrosion problems occur in all processes, when boron trifluoride is used toxicity problems arise with the boron trifluoride adducts and when iron or zinc is used there is a contamination of the waste water with iron or zinc ions which today is no longer acceptable.<br>
Since vinyl ether condensations are usually carried out with Lewis acids, disadvantages as described above for the Friedel-Crafts condensations with Lewis acids also occur in the case of this type of reaction.<br>
The object of the present invention is accordingly to provide a catalyst system for the aforementioned condensation reactions which does not have the disadvantages of the previously known procedures.   It is thus necessary that such a catalyst system is not corrosive, is not toxic, does not pollute the environment and catalyzes the desired reaction as selectively as possible and in high yields.   Moreover, the catalyst system should display this activity already in amounts which are truly only catalytic and should be readily separable.<br>
In the scope of the present invention this object is achieved by using hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate of formula I above as the protonic acid catalyst in the condensation reactions.<br>
The condensations can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent at temperatures between about 0°C and about 1 40°C depending on the type of reaction (Friedel-Crafts conden¬sation, vinyl ether condensation or acylation of phenols) and on the starting materials which are used.    Thus, the Friedel-Crafts condensation is carried out conveniently at temperatures between about 80°C and about 140°C, preferably between about 85°C and about 1 20°C, particularly at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.   On the other hand, the vinyl ether conden-<br><br>
sations are conveniently carried out in the absence of a solvent at temperatures between about 0°C and about 40°C, preferably between about 15°C and about 25°C, particularly at about room /temperature.<br>
As suitable solvents in the scope of the present invention there can be mentioned aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, xylene and the like, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. chlorobenzene and the like, aliphatic carboxylic acid esters, e.g. ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate and the like, aliphatic ethers, e.g. methyl tert.butyl ether, diisobutyl ether and the like, as well as aliphatic and cyclic ketones having a boiling point between about 80°C and about 140°C, e.g. diethyl ketone, methyl isopropyl &gt; ketone, cyciopentanone and the like.   Toluene and isopropyl acetate are preferred.<br>
In accordance with the invention the condensation can be carried out in the presence of about 0.1 to about 6, preferably » about 0.2 to about 4, particularly about 0.3 to about 3, mol% of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate as the catalyst (in each case based on the respective molar amount of starting material).<br>
The hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate of formula I above is known from Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 329. 1-29 (1987).   It can be prepared as described in Example 1, whereby it is advan¬tageously not prepared and used in situ, but in isolated form.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for carrying out a condensation reaction with a protonic acid catalyst, said condensation reaction being a Friedel-Crafts condensation, a vinyl ether condensation of an acetal with a propenyl ether or an acylation of a phenol wherein said protonic acid catalyst is hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate of the formula I<br><br>
under known condensation conditions and thereafter recovering the condensation product from the reaction mixture in a known manner.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention, but are not intended in any way to be a limitation. All temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
Example 1<br>
i<br>
13.96 g (150.36 mmol) of oxalic acid and 2.62 g (37.59 mmol) of diboron trioxide [or 8.4 ml (75.2 mmol) of trimethyl borate or 3.7 ml (25.1 mmol) of trimethoxyboroxine] were suspended in 450 ml of toluene in a 1 1 flask and stirred under reflux for 6 hours, with the reaction water which resulted<br><br>
being separated continuously using a water separator.   The cooled reaction mixture was subsequently filtered and the solid residue was dried in a vacuum, there being obtained hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate in 70% yield.<br>
Example 2<br>
28.398  g (100 mmol) of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-naphthalen-1-yl benzoate and 127.4 mg (0.569  mmol) of hydrogen bis-(oxalato)borate were placed in 170 ml of toluene in a 500 ml sulphonation flask.   The reaction mixture was heated to 98° and subsequently treated with 17.76 g (56.9  mmol) of isophytol within 15  seconds.<br>
After completion of the addition the reaction mixture was stirred at 98° for a further 30 minutes.   The yield of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-[(E)-3,7,1 1,1 5-tetramethyl-hexadec-2-enyl]-naphthalen-1-yl benzoate was 80% (calculated on isophytol, direct LC determination from the reaction mixture on the basis of a standard curve).<br>
Example 3<br>
35.240 g (200 mmol) of (E)-1,1,4,4-tetramethoxy-but-2-ene and 1.343 g (6 mmol) of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate were placed in a 200 ml sulphonation flask while stirring.    28.840 g (400 mmol) of methyl propenyl ether were subsequently added dropwise at room temperature within 4 hours and, after completion of the addition, the mixture was left to react for a further 30  minutes.<br>
The reaction solution was then treated' with 300 ml of water and 2  ml of 1 5% hydrochloric acid, and the resulting methanol was distilled off.    12  ml of 1 5% sodium hydroxide solution were added within 1 5  minutes and the mixture was stirred at 80° for a further 30  minutes.   The cooled reaction mixture was then filtered and dried, there being obtained 2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-(E,E,E)-octatrienedial in 67% yield (LC analysis).<br><br>
Example 4<br>
27.04 g (300 mmol) of acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal and 282 mg (1.26 mmol) of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate were placed in a 100  ml sulphonation flask and then 7.21   g (100  mmol) of methyl propenyl ether were added dropwise at room temperature within 2 hours.   After warming the reaction mixture to 40° for one hour it was left to cool to room temperature, with 1,1,3-trimethoxy-2-methyl-butane being obtained; the content of 1,1,3-trimethoxy-2-methyl-butane was 70% according to GC analysis.<br>
Example 5<br>
A mixture of 5.0 g (14.3  mmol) of 13-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexen-1 -y!)-2,7,1 1 -trimethyl-trideca-2,6,8,1 0, 1 2-pentaen-4-yn-1-al, 3.1  ml (18.2 mmol) of triethyl orthoformate, 0.8  ml of ethyl formate and 89.5  mg (0.4 mmol) of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate was placed in a 100  ml sulphonation flask.   The reaction mixture was stirred at 1 5° for 1   hour, subsequently treated dropwise at this temperature with 1.9  ml (19.7  mmol) of ethyl vinyl ether and stirred for a further 15  minutes.    The yield of 1 3,1 5,1 5-triethoxy-3,7,1 2-trimethyl-1 -(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohex-1 -enyl)-pentadeca-1,3,5,7,1 1 -pentaen-9-yne was 80%.<br>
Example 6<br>
60.88 g (400 mmol) of trimethylhydroquinone and 2.81   g (12.53  mmol) of hydrogen bis(oxalato)borate were placed in 180 ml of toluene in a 750 ml sulphonation flask.   The reaction mixture was subsequently heated to reflux under an argon atmosphere and 147.76 ml (400 mmol) of isophytol were then continuously added dropwise during 2  hours.   After completion of the addition the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for a further 30 minutes and, after cooling, treated with 200  ml of hexane.   The reaction mixture was subsequently extracted with methanol/water, there remaining behind after distillation of the<br><br>
solvent 104.5  g of crude d,l-a-tocopherol which had a content of 88.0% according to gas chromatographical analysis; yield 92%.<br>
