				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a system and method for testing point-to-point bus connections on a circuit board using JTAG.<br>
A well-known method for testing circuitry on, for example, a PC card is set forth in the IEEE 1149.1 boundary-scan standard originated by the international Joint Test Action Group (JTAG), hereby incorporated by reference. One implementation of this standard involves designing components (eg integrated circuits) for serial boundary-scan testing by providing shift register elements daisy-chained to form a path around the periphery of the integrated circuit component.<br>
The general concept for boundary scan testing using JTAG is to shift serial data in through a number of integrated circuit (IC) components to stimulate the circuitry on a PC card, and to sample IC input signals fi*om the circuitry of the PC card. Since the interconnect topology and logic functions of the PC card are known (i.e. between a JTAG output signal and a JTAG input elsewhere on the PC card), a master testing circuit can compare the return data to an expected result (i.e. a result which is dependent upon the ftmctions of the known circuitry and PC card interconnect). In other words, the serial data inputs applied to the circuit being tested produce known outputs if the PC card interconnect is correct and any circuitry between the JTAG source and sample points is functioning properly. The serial testing is also testing input and output pins and buffers of an integrated circuit, which incorporates JTAG, since these lie between the JTAG output and the JTAG input sample points.<br>
If the data stream returned to the master testing circuit is not as expected, then the interconnect path on the PC card is open or is shorted to another signal, or a malfunction exists in whatever logic exists along the path from the JTAG<br><br>
output to the JTAG input being analyzed. A careful analysis under software control of the deviations in the data stream may isolate any malfunctions within the PC card.<br>
In certain instances it is desirable to test a branch or portion of a bus on a PC card. For example, when testing the design of a system, it is often important to test for short circuits or open circuits on the board. This is because tightly spaced pins may have solder bridges between adjacent pins. Alternatively, a missing or improperly formed solder connection may result in an open circuit.<br>
However, sometimes the portion of the bus which is to be tested terminates in, for example, a memory slot so that there is no closed circuit formed by the bus. Thus, no JTAG circuitry is present on certain portions of the bus to be tested so that JTAG testing of the bus is not possible. This problem may exist, for example, m cases where no memory card is plugged into the memory slot, or where the memory card plugged into the slot does not have JTAG test capabilities. For example, a standard single in-line memory module (SIMM) or dual in-line memory module (DIMM) does not include JTAG test capabilities.<br>
One solution to this problem is the use of a "bed of nails" tester which is custom designed and built to test the portions of the bus on the PC card which terminate in vacant slots. However, such bed-of-nails testers may cost thousands of dollars so that such a tester would be expensive in many cases. Additionally, the test fixture which customizes the bed-of-nails tester to a specific PC card requires time to fabricate, and might be unavailable for use in the prototype phase of the PC card's design. Therefore, a need continues to exist for an inexpensive apparatus and method for testing buses in a computer system or the like.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A system for testing point-to-point connections on a circuit board using JTAG comprises the circuit board, including circuitry which is to be tested using JTAG. A bus on the circuit board includes connection pins, while a plurality of plug-in peripheral or expansion slots are electrically coupled with the bus pins. A plug-in JTAG test card further engages with one of the plug-in slots to<br><br>
configured to engage with the plug-in slot to establish communication between the bus connections and the boundary scan register. The plug-in test card also includes boundary scan control circuitry comprising a TAP controller and an instruction register.<br>
Under a still further aspect, the present invention is a system for testing multiple bus connections that interface with at least one plug-in slot on a motherboard. The multiple bus connections do not electrically communicate with JTAG test circuitry on the motherboard. The system comprises the motherboard, the bus having connections which interface with at least one plug-in slot on the motherboard, and at least one plug-in test card which engages with the plug-in slot to establish electrical communication between JTAG test circuitry on the plug-in test card and the bus connections. In a preferred embodiment, the JTAG test circuitry on the plug-in test card comprises a boundary scan register a TAP controller, and an instruction register.<br>
Under another aspect, the present invention is a JTAG plug-in test card for use in testing bus connections on a motherboard which interface with plug-in peripheral or expansion slots. The test card comprises a connector portion which engages with the plug-in peripheral or expansion slots, a boundary scan register and an input bus which provides an input path by which signals from the connector are provided as inputs to the boundary scan register. The plug-in card additionally includes an output bus by which output signals from the connector are provided to the connector and boundary scan control circuitry. The boundary scan control circuitry comprises a TAP controller and an instruction register.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a system for testing point-to-point bus connections on a circuit board using JTAG, said system comprising said circuit board including circuitry which is to be tested using JTAG; a bus on said circuit board, said bus including connection pins; one or more plug-in peripheral or expansion slots which are electrically coupled with said bus connections pins; characterized by a plug-in JTAG test card which engages with one of said plug-in slots to establish an electrical connection thereto, said test card including JTAG test buffer circuitry for driving test signals onto said bus connection pins via said plug-in slot engaged with said test card; and a JTAG test circuit which is in communication with said bus on said circuit board, wherein said test signals output by said test card are received by said JTAG test circuit for testing the integrity of point-to-point bus connections on said circuit board.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of testing bus connections on a motherboard which interface with a plug-in slot, said method comprising the steps of providing a plug-in test card having JTAG test buffer circuitry including, a boundary scan register, said test card configured to plug into said plug-in slot plugging said test card into said plug-in slot; shifting a test vector comprising data bits into said boundary scan register; outputting said test vector data bits from said boundary scan register over said bus connections via said plug-in slot; receiving said output test vector data bits via said bus connections; and comparing said received output test vector data bits to a predetermined output pattern in order to identify malfunctions in said bus connections.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified schematic block diagram illustrating a computer system 100. The computer system 100 includes a microprocessor 110 which communicates with a bus bridge 120 and a dynamic random-access memory controller (DRAM) 140 via a system bus 130. In one advantageous embodiment, the microprocessor 110 comprises a P6 microprocessor, and the bus bridge 120 comprises a P6-to-PCI bridge. The P6-to-PCI bridge 120 communicates with a disk drive 150 and a plug-in I/O slot 160 via a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus 170. The DRAM controller 140 connects to a first plug-in, dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slot 180 and a second plug-in DIMM slot 190 via a memory bus 195. When the computer system 100 is operational, DIMMs (not shown in Figure 1) having DRAM installed thereon are plugged into the slots 180, 190. Although the embodiment of Figure 1 depicts DIMM plug-in cards, single in-line memory modules (SIMMs, not shown) could be used as well in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.<br>
At the manufacturing stage it is desirable to be able to test each of the integrated circuit components, as well as each point-to-point connection between the circuit chips and along all of the buses using a JTAG boundary-scan test. However, in certain instances it may be difficult to test many of the point-to-point<br><br>
connections along some of the communication buses because one or more of the plug-in slots is empty or does not contain a module with JTAG compatibility.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, the plug-in I/O slot 160 and the plug-in DIMM slots 180 and 190 may be vacant so that the PCI bus 170 and the memory bus 195 will terminate at an open junction. Consequently, there is no closed circuit through which to test the lines of the PCI bus 170 or the memory bus 195 using JTAG. Furthermore, the plug-in slots 160, 180, and 190 may, alternatively, include modules which are not JTAG compatible so that the slots 160, 180, and 190, as well as portions of the PCI buses 170, 195, would not be testable using JTAG.<br>
Thus, in order to provide an inexpensive and efficient system and method to test each of the connections on the PCI bus 170 and the memory bus 195 using JTAG, and to test the DIMM slots 180, 190, a specially configured plug-in module 200 (see Figure 2) is inserted mto each of the slots which require JTAG compatibility for testing.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the plug-in JTAG test card 200 includes a plug-in connector 210 which, for example, provides a multiple-pm connection with the memory bus 195 (or, alternatively, the PCI bus 170). A respective JTAG test card for each of the slots 160, 180, 190 has an appropriate connector for each of the slots 160, 180, 190. The plug-in JTAG test card 200 further includes a JTAG test interface 220 to a plurality of JTAG test buffers 230. As shown in Figure 2, the JTAG test buffers 230 are used to connect to each signal pin of the intended bus to be tested (e.g., the memory bus 195 or the PCI bus 170). In one preferred embodiment, the JTAG test buffers 230 comprise the JTAG boundary scan logic found within octal bus transceivers available from Texas Instruments and sold under the model number of SN74ABT8245. This octal bus transceiver comprises two groups of eight JTAG bidirectional test buffers, each group sharing an output enable.<br>
It should be noted that the plug-in card 200 does not include memory, although memory or other circuitry may be implemented on the card 200 as called for by specific applications.   Rather, the plug-in card 200 is used only to<br><br>
complete the JTAG test circuit so that the card 200 has no functionality except as a JTAG test circuit. Thus, by inserting the JTAG test circuit 200 into one or more of the plug-in slots 160, 180, and 190, the busses 175, 190 can be inexpensively tested. Furthermore, the present invention costs significantly less than a bed-of-nails tester, which must be custom designed and built at costs of thousands of dollars.<br>
During testing, one or more of the plug-in cards 200 can be inserted into receiving plug-in slots over and over again and used as a test circuit for buses on multiple computer systems to be tested.<br>
When the plug-in cards 200 are used to test bus connections for buses already configured for JTAG testing (such as the PCI bus 170 shown in Figure 1), the appropriate lines for shifting JTAG data and instructions into the data and instruction boundary registers (see Figures 3 and 4) within the JTAG test circuits are aheady provided. However, if the plug-in JTAG test card 200 is connected for test with a bus which is not normally configured for JTAG (such as an ISA bus, a conventional memory bus or a PCI bus without a useable JTAG interface), then special JTAG Imes must be connected to the cards 200 via special connectors, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, so the data and instructions can be shifted into the JTAG data and instruction shift registers.<br>
Figure 5 schematically illustrates an embodiment of the plug-in card 200 wherein the JTAG connections are formed on the edge of the card opposite fim the bus connections. Four JTAG lines, including a mode select (TMS) line 240, a clock (TCK) line 242, a data in (TDI) line 244 and an optional reset (TRST*) line 246 are connected to the JTAG test buffers 230. The TMS, TCK and TRST* lines 240, 242, 246 connect in parallel with each of the buffers 230, while the TDI line 244 connects in serial (i.e., in a daisy chain) through the test buffers 230, as is well understood in the art. A fifth JTAG data out (TDO) line 248 returns the output data fim the last buffer 230. The input lines 240, 242, 244, 246 are connected to the card 200 in Figure 5 via a JTAG input connector 250. The TMS, TCK and TRST* input lines 240, 242, 246 are also connected to a JTAG output connector 252, and the TDO line 248 is also provided to the JTAG<br><br>
output connector 252.   A parallel bus 254 provides interconnections between a bus connector 256 and the input/output pins of the JTAG test buffers 230.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates multiple plug-in cards as connected during testing of a motherboard 600. As shown in Figure 6, the JTAG test lines connect on the back of the cards 200 rather than through the bus connection because, in the application depicted, either the bus does not include JTAG test lines or the bus contains JTAG test lines which are not daisy chained with the motherboard's scan chain.<br>
Figure 3 is a functional block diagram of an SN74ABT82425. Figure 3 depicts the internal circuitry of a commercially available IC which might be used to provide the scan test buffers 230 of Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3, the buffers 230 include a boundary scan register 300 and eight bidirectional buffer channels 310 (only one buffer channel 310 is shown in Figure 3). Each bidirectional channel buffer 310 provides an interconnection between one bit of an A-bus (shown on the left in Figure 3) and the corresponding bit of a B-bus (shown on the right in Figure 3). Only the bidirectional channel buffer 310 for the interconnection between the first bit (Al) of the A-bus and the first bit (Bl) of the B-bus is shown in Figure 3. The other seven buffer channels (not shown) interconnect bits A2 and B2, bits A3 and B3, bits A4 and B4, bits A5 and B5, bits A6 and B6, bits A7 and B7, bits A8 and B8. Each buffer channel 310 includes respective input buffers 312, 318 and respective output buffers 314, 316. The output buffers 314, 316 are tri-state buffers having a high-impedance state controlled by the output enable A (OEA) and output enable B (OEB) outputs of an AND gate 320 and an AND gate 322, respectively, in the normal mode, and controlled by JTAG boundary scan output cells (OUT CELL) 324, 326, respectively, in the JTAG test mode.<br>
The AND gate 320 receives a first inverting input from an active low output enable (OE) line 328 via a buffer 330. A JTAG boundary scan mput cell (IN CELL) 332 in the boundary scan register 300 is connected to the output of the buffer 330 to monitor the state of the output enable line 328. A second non-inverting input to the AND gate 320 is provided by a direction (DIR) line<br><br>
334 via a buffer 336. A JTAG boundary scan input cell 338 in the boundary scan register 300 is connected to the output of the buffer 336 to permit the state of the direction line 334 to be monitored. The AND gate 322 receives an inverted input from the output enable line 328 and receives an inverted input from the direction line 334 via the buffers 330, 336, respectively. It can thus be seen that in the origmally intended use of the buffer 230, only one of the OEA and the OEB signals from the AND gates 320, 322 can be active at one time in accordance with the state of the DIR signal on the line 334. In the preferred embodiment, the output enable and direction lines 328, 334 are tied high so that when the scan test buffers 230 are not in the JTAG test mode, the sixteen I/O pins of the octal buffer are in a high-impedance mode and do not affect the bus being tested. In the JTAG mode described herein, the output enable line 328, the direction line 334 and the AND gates 320, 322 are not used, and the buffers are controlled solely by the JTAG output cells 324, 326.<br>
Each of the eight channels is further controlled by an A-bus side JTAG input cell 340, an A-side JTAG output cell 342, a B-side JTAG input cell 346 and a B-side JTAG output cell 348 in the boundary scan register 300, as discussed more fully below in connection with Figures 4A and 4B.<br>
The boundary scan register 300 receives data and instruction bits which may be shifted into the boundary scan register 300 under the control of conventional JTAG test circuitry. Specifically, the JTAG test circuitry which controls the boundary scan register 300 includes a bypass register 350, a boundary control register 355, an instruction register 360, and a TAP controller 365. The registers 350-360 receive a test data input (TDI) signal on a line 370 via a buffer 371. The TAP controller 365 receives a test mode select (TMS) signal on a line 372 via a buffer 373 and receives a test clock (TCK) signal on a line 374 via a buffer 375. The TAP confroller 365 provides control outputs to the instruction register 360, the boundary confrol register 355, and the bypass register 350.<br>
The output of the boundary scan register 300 is provided as a first input to a three-input multiplexer 380, while the outputs of the bypass register 350 and<br><br>
the boundary control register 355 serve as second and third inputs to the multiplexer 380. The instruction register 360 provides a select output to the multiplexer 380. The output of the multiplexer 380 serves as a first input to a 2:1 multiplexer 385, while the output of the instruction register 360 serves as a second input to the multiplexer 385. The tap controller provides a select input to the multiplexer 385 and also provides a tri-state input to a test data output buffer 390 which connects to the output of the multiplexer 385. The output of the output buffer 390 is the TDO signal on a line 392<br>
The method for performing JTAG testing using the circuit of Figure 3 is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, see the above-incorporated IEEE 1149.1 JTAG boundary-scan standard for a description of the method used to shift in the appropriate test vectors, etc.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B illustrate more detailed functional block diagrams of the input cells and output cells of the boundary scan register 300. In particular, the input cell 340 is illustrated in Figure 4A and the output cell 348 is illustrated in Figure 4B. The other input cells and output cells have similar configurations.<br>
As shown in Figure 4A, the exemplary input cell 340 comprises a 2-to-l multiplexer 400 which receives a first input (0) from the boundary scan chain. That is, the first input is connected to receive the output of the previous input cell or output cell in the boundary scan register 300 or to receive the TDI input fit)m the buffer 370 in Figure 3. The multiplexer 400 has a second mput (1) which receives the output of the input buffer 312. Other mput cells (not shown) receive corresponding inputs from the boundary scan chain and from respective input buffers.<br>
The multiplexer 400 has a select input (S) which is controlled by a CAPTUREDR signal which is generated by the TAP controller 365 in Figure 3. When the CAPTURE_DR signal is active, the multipJexer 400 selects the output of the input buffer 312. When the CAPTURE_,DR signal is inactive, the multiplexer 400 selects the input from the boundary scan chain.<br>
The output of the muhiplexer 400 is provided as the data input (D) of a flip-flop 402 which  is clocked by a data register  clock (DRCLK)  signal<br><br>
generated by the TAP controller 365 (Figure 3). The output (Q) of the flip-flop 402 is provided as the shift output of the input cell 340 which is provided as the shift input to the next cell in the boundary scan chain or, if the particular input cell is the last cell in the boundary scan chain, as the data output of the boimdary scan register 300 to the multiplexer 380 in Figure 3. During boundary scan shift operations, the CAPTURE_DR signal to the select input of the multiplexer 400 is inactive so that the flip-flop 402 is connected as part of a boimdary scan shift register comprising the other input cells and the output cells.<br>
As ftu^er illustrated in Figure 4A, the output of the input buffer 312 is provided as an input to the output cell 348 described below in coimection with Figure 4B.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4B, the exemplary output cell 348 comprises an mput multiplexer 420 havmg a first input (0), a second input (1), a select input (S) and an output. The first input is connected to receive the output of the previous input cell or output cell in the boundary scan register 300 or to receive the TDI input fi-om the buffer 370 in Figure 3. The second input receives the output of the input buffer 312 (Figure 4A). The select input is controlled by the CAPTURE_DR signal described above.<br>
The output of the input multiplexer 420 is provided as the data input (D) of a flip-flop 422 which is also clocked by the DR_CLK signal described above. The data output (Q) of the flip-flop 422 is provided as the data input to a latch 424 which has a latch enable control input which is controlled by an UPDATE_DR signal generated by the TAP controller 365 in Figure 3. The UPDATEDR signal is activated by the TAP controller 365 in response to update instructions received via the TMS signal line 372 (Figiu-e 3).<br>
The data output of the flip-flop 422 is also provided as the shift output of the output cell 348 which is provided as the shift input to the next cell in the boundary scan chain or, if the particular output cell is the last cell in the boimdary scan chain, as the data output of the boundary scan register 300 to the multiplexer 380 in Figure 3.<br><br>
The output cell 348 further includes an output multiplexer 426 which has a first input (0), a second input (1), a select mput S) and an output. The first input of the output multiplexer 426 receives the output of the input buffer 312 (Figure 4A). The second input of the output multiplexer 426 receives the data output of the latch 424. The select input receives a TEST_MODE signal which is generated by the TAP controller 365 in response to the receipt of a test mode instruction on the TMS line 372. When the TEST_MODE signal is inactive, the output of the buffer 312 (Figure 4A) is provided as the output of the output multiplexer 426 which is provided as the input to the output buffer 316 (also shown in Figures 3 and 4B). When the TEST_MODE signal is active, the output of the latch 424 is provides as the output of the output multiplexer 426 to the output buffer 316.<br>
Output buffers 314 and 316 in Figure 3 are enabled by signals from output cells 326 and 324, respectively. The output cells 326, 324 are similar to those described m Figure 4B, with the exceptions that the outputs of the cells 324, 326 connect to the high impedance control input of their respective output buffer 316, 314. In addition, the inputs of the cells 326, 324 come from OEA and OEB (output enable A and output enable B), respectively.<br>
In the SN74ABT8245 buffer 230 in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the input cells 340 and the output cells 348 are connected m the boundary scan shift register as follows. The test data input (TDI) signal 370 is provided from the input buffer 371 to the OEB output cell 324, then to the OEA output cell 326, then to the DIR input cell 338, then to the OE input cell 332, then to the B-side input cells (B8, B7, B6, B5, B4, B3, B2, Bl), then to the B-side output cells (B8, B7, B6, B5, B4, B3, B2, Bl), then to the A-side input cells (A8, A7, A6, A5. A4, A3, A2, Al), then to the A-side output cells (A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A3, A2, Al), and then to the test data output (TDO) signal via the multiplexer 380, the multiplexer 385 and the output buffer 390.<br>
It should be noted that the JTAG test logic within the SN74ABT8245 integrated circuit is more complex than illustrated in Figures 4A and 4B. For simplicity, only the functions required for boundary scan testing are shown.   A<br><br>
SN74ABT8245 integrated circuit also includes logic to support other JTAG functions which can also be used, but which are not required for implementation of the invention described herein.<br>
In the testing operation provided by the present invention, the data shifted into the boundary scan register 300 are latched into the latches 424 in each of the output cells 342, 348, 326 and 324 connected to the A-bus and the B-bus, the output multiplexers 426 controlled to select the second mputs (1), and the output buffers 314 and 316 connected to each output cell 342, 348, and enabled by output cells 326, 324 so that a bus under test connected to the pins of the buffers 230 is driven with selected data from the buffers 230. The data on the bus are received by other logic connected to the bus under test and compared with expected data to determine whether each of the pins on the bus under test has been properly driven.<br>
Conversely, the bus under test can be driven by other logic when the output buffers 314, 316 are disabled. The data on the bus under test are then received via the input buffers 312, 318 and captured in the respective flip-flops 402. Thereafter, the received data are shifted out of the boundary scan register 300 to the TDO line. The serial output data on the TDO are received by a JTAG test master (see Figure 7) and compared with expected data to determine if the bus under test is functioning properly.<br>
In this manner, the plug-in cards 200, including JTAG circuitry within the boundary scan register 300, provide an inexpensive and efficient system and method for testing portions of the PCI bus 170 and the memory bus 195 which, otherwise, would not be testable in a JTAG environment.<br>
In operation, as schematically illustrated in Figure 7, JTAG commands and data are shifted into instruction and data registers within JTAG circuitry (not shown in Figure 7) on the motherboard 600, and JTAG circuitry (also not shown in Figure 7) on the first and second DIMM cards 200 fi-om a JTAG master test circuit 700. The data and instructions are shifted into their respective registers via a connector 705, a cable 710, a connector 715, a connector 420, a cable 720, a connector 725, a connector 730, a cable 735, a connector 740, a connector 745<br><br>
and a cable 750. The connector 715 engages with a mating connector 420 on the edge of the motherboard 600, as depicted in Figure 7, while the connectors 725, 730, 740 and 745 engage with respective mating connectors on the edges of the plug-in cards 200. In one advantageous embodiment, the connectors 725, 730, 740 and 745 are alternately male and female type connectors {e.g., connector 725 of the cable 720 is a male connector, connector 730 of the cable 735 is a female connector, etc.) so that one or more of the plug-in cards 200 can be bypassed (if, for example, there is an empty slot). Thus, for example, if the slots 180, 190 are both empty, connector 725 of the cable 720 can engage directly with connector 745 of the cable 750 so that the JTAG master test circuit can be easily connected for test to as many circuits as support JTAG testing.<br>
Once the appropriate data have been shifted into the JTAG registers, the data are applied to the connection points and are received by JTAG circuitry at another location in communication with the connection points. For example, the first plug-in card 200 (engaged with the slot 180) could output data onto the bus 195 (see Figure 1) which is received, for example, by the DRAM controller 140. JTAG circuitry within the DRAM controller 140 (not shown) reads the data on the bus 195 and transfers it back to the JTAG master test circuit 700, via the connector 715, to be verified.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail above, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that certain obvious modifications could be made to the present invention without department from its spirit or essential characteristics. For example, inexpensive test circuits other than SN74ABT8245's described herein could be used to implement the JTAG plug-in test card 200. Therefore, the above description should be taken as illustrative but not restrictive. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should be interpreted solely in light of the following appended claims.<br><br><br>
