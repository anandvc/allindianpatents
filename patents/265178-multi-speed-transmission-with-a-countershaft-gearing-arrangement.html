MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
A COUNTERSHAFT GEARING ARRANGEMENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having a<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination<br>
of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-<br>
on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other,<br>
with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow<br>
from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept<br>
typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to<br>
achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly, the total number of gears required<br>
in this typical design is two times the number of forward speeds, plus three for<br>
reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear pairs, especially in<br>
transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed ratios.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	In an aspect of the present invention, a powertrain having a<br>
transmission input member, a power source for generating a torque in the input<br>
member, a first intermediate shaft, a second intermediate shaft concentric with the<br>
first intermediate shaft, a clutch, a first countershaft, a second countershaft, first<br>
set of gears, a second set of gears, an output shaft and first and second transfer<br>
gears is provided.<br><br>
2<br>
[0004]	The first countershaft is radially spaced from the second<br>
intermediate shaft. The second countershaft is radially spaced from the second<br>
intermediate shaft. The clutch is selectively cngagable to couple the transmission<br>
input member with one of the first and second intermediate shafts. The first set of<br>
gears are connected for common rotation with one of the first and second<br>
intermediate shafts and intermesh with a first selectable set of gears to form a first<br>
plurality of co-planar gear sets. Each of the gears of the first selectable set of gears<br>
is connectable for common rotation with at least one of the first and second<br>
countershafts for selectively transferring the torque to the countershafts when the<br>
clutch is engaged.<br>
[0005]	The second set of gears is connected for common rotation with the<br>
other of the first and second intermediate shafts and intermeshes with a second set<br>
of gears. The second set of gears are selectively connectable for common rotation<br>
with at least one of the countershafts to form a second plurality of co-planar gear<br>
sets for selectively transferring the torque to the countershafts when the clutch is<br>
engaged.<br>
[0006]	The output shaft is disposed radially outward of the second<br>
intermediate shaft. The first transfer gear is coupled to the first countershaft for<br>
transferring torque from the first countershaft to the output shaft. The second<br>
transfer gear is coupled to the second countershaft for transferring torque from the<br>
second countershaft to the output shaft.<br>
[0007]	In another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set that<br>
provides a first gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting walls.<br>
[0008]	In still another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a second gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting<br>
walls.<br>
[0009]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a third gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting walls.<br><br>
3<br>
[0010]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a fourth gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting<br>
walls.<br>
[0011]	In yet another aspect of the present .invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a fifth gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting walls.<br>
[0012]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a sixth gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting walls.<br>
[0013]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, a co-planar gear set<br>
that provides a seventh gear ratio is adjacent one of the plurality of supporting<br>
walls.<br>
[0014]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

shalt 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one reverse<br>
torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is<br>

one or more of the synchronizers 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with<br>
each torque ratio.<br>
[0030]	To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 36 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 110 are engaged. By the engagement of clutch element<br>
36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the second intermediate shaft 24 through gear 62 to idler gear 66. Idler gear 66<br>

[0033]	The subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear.) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 124. By the engagement<br>
of clutch clement 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 92. Gear 92 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 94. Upon engagement of synchronizer-124, torque is transferred from<br>
gear 94 to second countershaft 28. Second countershaft 28 transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear 52. Transfer gear 52 transfers torque to. transfer gear 54, which in turn<br>
transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the<br>
final drive unit 18.<br>

engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 112. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24.<br>

torque is transferred from gear 74 to first countershaft 26. First countershaft 26<br>
transfers the torque to transfer gear 44. Transfer gear 44 transfers torque to transfer<br>
gear 42, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14<br>

of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br><br>
9<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 82. Gear 82 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 84. Upon engagement of synchronizer 118, gear 84 transfers torque<br>
to first countershaft 26. First countershaft 26 transfers the torque to transfer gear 44.<br>
Transfer gear 44 transfers torque to transfer gear 42, which in turn transfers the<br>
torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit<br>
1 8.<br>
[0036]	A subsequent forward torque ratio' (6lh gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch clement 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 1 16. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch,30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24.<br>
Further, torque is transferred from the second intermediate shaft 24 to gear 72.<br>
Gear 72 transfers the torque to gear 76. Upon engagement of synchronizer 116,<br>
torque is transferred from gear 76 to the second countershaft 28. Second<br>
countershaft 28 transfers the torque to transfer gear 52. Transfer gear 52 transfers<br>
torque to transfer gear 54, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14.<br>
Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0037]	The subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch clement 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 122. By the engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 82. Gear 82 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 86. Upon engagement of synchronizer 122, torque is transferred from<br>
gear 86 to second countershaft 28. Second countershaft 28 transfers the torque to<br>
transfer gear 52. Transfer gear 52 transfers torque to transfer gear 54, which in turn<br>
transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the<br>
final drive unit 18.<br>
[0038]	The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios<br>
(i.e.. the ratio of torque of the output member 14 to the input member 12) are<br>
achievable through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10.<br><br>
10<br>
Moreover, the present invention advantageously provides the transfer gears 42, 44,<br>
52. 54 in two separate planes. This arrangement provides the opportunity to achieve<br>
the desired gear ratios. Further, flexibility is provided in the selection of gear ratios<br>
with respect to 1st gear and 3rd gear, as the gears (102, 104, 92 and 94) that provide<br>
these ratios are disposed in two separate planes, and do not share the same pinion<br>
gears (i.e. pinion gear 92 does not mesh with gears 102 and/or 104). An overall<br>
transmission length reduction is achieved using idler gear 66, which is disposed in a<br>
