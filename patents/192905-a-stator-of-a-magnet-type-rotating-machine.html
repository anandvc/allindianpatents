The present invention relates to a stator of a magnet-type rotating machine and, more particularly, to a positioning member for fixing the magnetic poles of a stator. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART;<br>
Fig. 4 is a front view of a conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 63-97764. Fig. 5 is a development view taken along the line V-V of Fig. 4. Auxiliary magnetic poles 3 made of iron are arranged circumferentially at even intervals on the inner peripheral surface of a cylindrical yoke 1, and are welded and fixed to the yoke 1. Main magnetic poles 2 which are in pairs with and adjacent to each of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 are arranged on the inner peripheral surface of the yoke 1. The width dimension of the main magnetic poles 2 is different from that of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 along the axial direction.<br>
Further, each positioning member 4 sandwiched in the circumferential gap between the main magnetic poles 2 and the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 is arranged on the inner peripheral surface of the yoke 1. The positioning member 4 is formed into a U shape in such a way that a plate material, such as stainless steel, is punched into a member in a long length using a press or the like and bent transversely, and its cross section is opened. The positioning member 4 is sandwiched in the gap between the main magnetic pole 2 and the auxiliary magnetic pole 3 in a state in which the opened sides are contracted toward the inward, presses the main magnetic pole 2 and the auxiliary magnetic pole 3 at both sides by the elastic recovering force of the positioning member 4 itself, and thus fixes the main magnetic poles 2 circumferentially with respect to the auxiliary magnetic pole 3 fixed to the yoke 1 by the frictional force produced by the press.<br>
Each positioning member 4 is formed with a first engagement section 4a protrusively provided at both ends thereof on the main magnetic pole 2 side, and a second engagement section 4b protrusively provided on the auxiliary magnetic pole<br><br>
3 side. The positioning member 4 restrains the main magnetic poles 2 in such a way that, when the main magnetic poles 2 are going to move in the axial direction, the main magnetic poles 2 are not moved in the axial direction with respect to the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 fixed to the yoke 1 by means of engagement sections 4a, 4a, 4b and 4b.<br>
The positioning member 4 is further formed with a third engagement section 4c capable of forming the same axial dimensional width as that of the second engagement section 4b on the first engagement section 4a, and a fourth engagement section 4d capable of forming the same axial dimensional width as that of the first engagement section 4a on the second engagement section 4b.<br>
In a step of assembling such a conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine, auxiliary magnetic poles 3 made of iron are arranged circumferentially at even intervals on the inner peripheral surface of the yoke 1 and welded. Thereafter, the positioning member 4 and the main magnetic pole 2 are pushed into the gap between the adjacent auxiliary magnetic poles 3 and 3 at the same time. At this time, neither of the engagement sections 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d of the positioning member 4 is opened, and the positioning member 4 is pushed in a state in which both sides of the opened U-shaped cross section is contracted toward the inward. Thereafter, the first engagement section 4a of the positioning member 4 engageable with the main magnetic pole 2 and the second engagement section 4b engageable with the main magnetic pole 2 are opened.<br>
In the conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine constructed as described above, when the main magnetic pole 2 is going to move in the axial direction, the engagement sections 4a, 4a, 4b and 4b restrain the movement of the main magnetic poles 2 to the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 fixed to the yoke 1. Since the positioning member 4 is further formed with a third engagement section 4c capable of forming the same axial dimensional width as that of the second engagement section 4b on the first engagement section 4a, and a fourth engagement section 4d capable of forming the same axial dimensional width as that of the first engagement section 4a on the second engagement section 4b as stated earlier, in a rotating machine having the main magnetic poles 2 and the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 arranged reversely, it is possible to assemble the rotating machine without<br><br>
changing the direction the positioning member 4 is inserted, and thus workability is good.<br>
However, in the conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine, in a plurality of types of rotating machines having a different size, for the rotating machine comprising main magnetic poles having different axial lengths or auxiliary magnetic poles having di£ferent axial lengths, a positioning member is required having an engagement section at a position corresponding to the axial length of the main magnetic poles or the auxiliary magnetic poles. That is, the same number of types of positioning members are required for a plurality of types of main magnetic poles or auxiliary magnetic poles having different lengths. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been are achieved to solve the above-described problems of the prior art. An object of present invention is to provide a stator of a magnet-type rotating machine, capable of dealing with a plurality of types of main magnetic poles or auxiliaiy magnetic poles having different lengths by one type of positioning member.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a stator of a magnet-type rotating machine comprising a hollow cylindrical yoke; a plurality of auxiliary magnetic poles disposed at equal circumferential intervals on the inner peripheral surface of said yoke; main magnetic poles provided adjacent to said auxiliary magnetic poles along the circumference in such a manner as to make a pair with said auxiliary magnetic poles on the inner peripheral surface of said yoke; and positioning members, each of which is formed into a cross-sectional U-shape and attached within tiie circumferential gap between said main magnetic poles and said auxiliary magnetic poles on the inner peripheral surface of said yoke, characterised in that the positioning members have three or more engagement sections which engage to each in main magnetic poles and<br><br>
auxiliary magnetic poles; more than two of said engagement sections on the main magnetic pole side being protruded to engage with the end of said main magnetic pole; and more than two of said engagement sections on the auxiliary magnetic pole side being protruded to engage with the end of said auxiliary magnetic pole; whereby said main magnetic poles are positioned in the circumference and the axial directions with respect to said auxiliary magnetic poles; wherein said engagement sections to be protruded on the main magnetic pole side and said engagement sections to be protruded on the auxiliary magnetic pole side are selectively protrusively provided in accordance with the axial length of said main magnetic poles and said auxiliary magnetic poles, and thus the main magnetic poles and the auxiliaiy magnetic poles having different axial lengths are locked to each other.<br><br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 is a development view illustrating an example of a stator of a magnet-type rotating machine in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a development view illustrating an example in which main magnetic poles having different lengths are fixed;<br>
Fig. 3 is a development view illustrating an example in which auxiliary magnetic poles having different lengths are fixed;<br>
Fig. 4 is a front view of a conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine; and<br>
Fig. 5 is a development view taken along the line V-V of Fig. 4.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 is a development view illustrating an example of a stator of a magnet-type rotating machine in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a development view illustrating an example in which main magnetic poles having different lengths are fixed. Fig. 3 is a development view illustrating an example in which auxiliary magnetic poles having different lengths are fixed. The same or like components as the conventional stator of a magnet-type rotating machine shown in Figs. 4 and 3 are given the same reference numerals, and an explanation thereof is omitted.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, a positioning member 14 formed into a U-shape in such a way that a plate material, such as stainless steel, is punched into a member in a long length by a press or the like and bent transversely, and its cross section is opened is sandwiched in the circumferential gap between the main magnetic pole 2<br>
and the  auxiliary magnetic  pole 3 on the inner peripherial surface of the yoke 1 in a<br><br>
state in which both sides opened in a U-shape are contracted toward the inward i the same manner as in the prior art. The positioning member 14 presses the mai magnetic pole 2 and the auxiliary magnetic pole 3 on both sides of the positionin member 14 by the elastic recovering force itself, and fixes the main magnetic pol 2 circumferentially with respect to the auxiliary magnetic pole 3 fixed to the yoke by the frictional force produced by the press.<br>
In Fig. 1, a plurality of cutouts are provided on both sides of both en portions of the positioning member 14, and formed therein are a plurality ( engagement sections 14a, 14b, 14c and 14d on the main magnetic pole side, and plurality of engagement sections 14e, 14f, 14g and 14h on the auxiliary magneti pole side. The plurality of engagement sections on the main magnetic pole side an the plurality of engagement sections on the auxiliary magnetic pole side ar symmetrical with respect to the long axis which is the center axis along the length c the positioning member 14. The plurality of engagement sections on the mai magnetic pole side and the plurality of engagement sections on the auxiliar magnetic pole side, formed on both ends of the positioning member 14, ar symmetrical with respect to the short axis which is the center axis along th transverse direction of the positioning member 14. Engagement sections 14a on th main magnetic pole side on both ends at positions corresponding to an axial lengt A of the main magnetic poles 2 from among the plurality of engagement sections o the main magnetic pole side are widened outward. Engagement sections 14g on th auxiliary magnetic pole side on both ends at positions corresponding to an axij length C of the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 from among the plurality of engagemer sections on the auxiliary magnetic pole side are widened outward.<br>
Fig. 2 is a development view illustrating an example in which mai magnetic poles 22 having different lengths are fixed. The engagement sections 14 on the main magnetic pole side at both ends at positions corresponding to an axi£ length B of the main magnetic poles 22 are widened outward. Fig. 3 is development view illustrating an example in which auxiliary magnetic poles 23 havin different lengths are fixed. The engagement sections 14f on the auxiliary magneti pole side at both ends at positions corresponding to an axial lerigth D of the auxiliai" magnetic poles 23 are widened outward.<br><br>
In the stator of a magnet-type rotating machine constructed as described above in accordance with the present invention, the positioning member 14 restrains the movement of the main magnetic poles 2 or the main magnetic poles 22 in the axial direction to the auxiliay magnetic poles 3 or the auxiliary magnetic poles 23 which are welded and fixed to the yoke 1 by making each of the engagement sections which are widened outward lock the end portions thereof along the axis when the main magnetic poles 2 or the main magnetic poles 22 are going to move in the axial direction.<br>
As described above, in the stator of the present invention, one type of positioning member 14 is able to deal with a plurality of main magnetic poles 2 and main magnetic poles 22 having different lengths, and one type of positioning member 14 is able to deal with a plurality of auxiliary magnetic poles 3 and auxiliary magnetic poles 23 having different lengths. Thus, parts can be shared, and the cost of the stator can be reduced.<br>
Since the engagement sections of the positioning member 14 on the main magnetic pole side and the engagement sections on the auxiliary magnetic poles are symmetrical with respect to the long axis, in a magnet-type rotating machine having the main magnetic poles 2 and the auxiliary magnetic poles 3 arranged reversely, it is possible to assemble the rotating machine without changing the direction the positioning member 14 is inserted, and thus workability is good. Further, since the engagement sections on the main magnetic pole side and the engagement sections on the auxiliary magnetic pole side, formed on both ends of the positioning member 14, are symmetrical with respect to the short axis, it is possible to insert the positioning member 14 without considering the direction during the assembly of the rotating machine, and thus workability is good.<br>
Also, since the positioning member 14 is formed by bending a plate material, it is easy to give elastic properties to the positioning member 14 and to manufacture it at a low cost.<br>
Four engagement sections of the positioning member 14 on the main magnetic pole side and four engagement sections of the positioning member 14 on the auxiliary magnetic pole side in accordance with this embodiment are formed on one side.  However, needless to say, even more number of engagement sections<br><br>
may be formed so as to deal with even more number of types of rotating machines.<br><br><br>
