It has been found that the compounds of general formula I and I* as well as individual isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof (hereinafter: Active Compounds)" are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors-<br>
Monoamine oxidase {MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes [Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1988)1 and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al, J. Neural. Transm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer"s disease [Dostert et al., Bio-chem. PhssmAOol. 38-.555-561 (T.9%9^ and it has heeo. found to he. highJ-V expressed in. astrocytes around senile plaques [Saura et al., Neurosdence 70:755-774 (1994)]. In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NHj, aldehydes and H202, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson"s disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopa¬minergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated wim age and Alzheimer"s and Parkinson"s diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO acti¬vity and consequent increased formation ofHi02by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibi¬tors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for<br><br>
example discussed by BentuS-Ferrer et a]. [CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1996)]. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due lo the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications [Gardner et ah, J. Clin. Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996)], these adverse events are of less concern with rever¬sible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br>

In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I comprising reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br><br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, scheme 1 shows the main routes to compounds of the formula I wherein R3 is-C(0)N(H)CH3, i.e. compounds of formula I**". The reaction of the intermediates IV and IVa with itaconic acid V is preferentially done neat at temperatures between 80°C and 2008C. Compounds of formula Ha and IVa are then transformed to esters of formula lib and Via by methods known per se. Compounds of formula Via can then be alkylated by Williamson-ether synthesis using optionally substituted benzylic halides, tosylates, mesylates or triflates. Bases used can be, e.g., alcoholates or carbonates, like e.g. sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate. Examples for solvents are lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones. The temperature may be, e.g. in the range of from 20°C to reflux temperature. Another approach is the Mitsunobu-coupling of optionally substituted benzylic alcohols with phenol Via. The reaction maybe done as usual in inert solvents like, e.g., diethyl ether or tetrahydrofurane, using dialkyi-azo-dicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines (e.g. tributyl- or triphenyl-phosphine)-<br><br>
The hydrolysis of compounds of formula Via car be performed by methods known per se like hydrolysis under acidic conditions, e.g. with hydrochloric acid, or basic conditions, e.g. lithium, sodium- or potassium hydroxide in mixtures of alcohols and water as the solvent.<br><br><br>
Amides of formula I** or \1b can be obtained by aminolysis of esters of formula lib or Via with amines of formula R -NH2 at a temperature in the range of from room temperature (RT) and 120"C, e.g. in sealed tubes using solvents inert under these conditions, like e.g. dimethoxyethane, dioxane, or methanol. Alternatively, acids of formula [la may be trans¬formed into compounds of formula I** using standard procedures. They can be activated via, e.g., acid chloride or mixed anhydride. Especially for the preparation of enantiopure derivatives, condensation reagents like carbodiimides, e.g. dicyclohexyi-carbodiimide, or benzotriazol derivatives, e.g. 0-(benzotria2ol-l-yl)-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronmm-hexa-fluorophosphate (HBTU) may be applied.<br>
Another method to prepare compounds of formula I involves cross-coupling reactions of arylstannanes [Lam et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 43:3091 (2002)1, arylboronates [Lam et al., Synlett 5:674 (2000)-, Chan et al., Tetrahedron Lett 39:2933 (1998)] or aryl halides [Buch-wald et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 118:7215(1996)] with the corresponding pyrrolidanes (scheme 2).<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, a possibility to prepare the intermediates of general formula IV, wherein -X-Y- is-CHj-O-, i.e. a compound of formula IVb, is shown in scheme 3: The intermediates of formula XII are accessible through nucleophilic substitution of aromatic nitro compounds of formula XI containing p-substituted leaving groups with benzyhc alcohols of formula X. Leaving groups in para-position can be, e.g., halogens (F, CI, Br, I), tosylates, mesylates or trifiates. These substitution reactions can be conducted neat or in inert solvents like, e.g., toluene or xylene. The reaction temperature maybe in the range of from 50°C to 150SC. Alternatively, compounds of formula XII can be prepared by Wuliamson-efher synthesis, starting from p-nitrophenols of formula XTV and benzyhc halides, tosylates, mesylates or trifiates of formula XIII. Bases used can be, e.g., alcoholates or carbonates (sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate). Examples for solvents are lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones. The temperature may be in the<br><br>
range of from 20"C to reflux temperature. Another approach is the Mitsur.obu-coupling of benzylic alcohols with p-nitrophenols of formula XIV. The reaction is done as usual in inert solvents like for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofurane, using dialkyl azo-dicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines like e.g. tributyl- or triphenyi-phosphine.<br><br><br><br>
The key intermediates of formula XVII can be reduced selectively to the amino-olefins of formula IVd using catalytic hydrogenation like e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the cata¬lyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofurane as the solvent, or, by metals or metal salts, like e.g. tin-(II)-chloride. The amino derivatives of formula IVe can be ob¬tained directly from the nitro derivatives of formula XVII or from the amino-olefins of formula IVd by hydrogenation using palladium on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alco¬hols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofurane as the solvent.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula II can be reduced to the intermediate compound of formula III. This may be done by first converting the acids of formula II into their esters (alcohol / acid catalysis) followed by reduction with reagents like sodium borohydride in solvents like tetrahydrofurane at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to 65°C. Activa¬tion of the alcohol of formula III via mesylate or triflate and reaction with sodium or potassium cyanide at a temperature in the range of from 40°C to 80°C leads to the desired compounds of formula I wherein R is CH2CN, i.e. nitriles of formula lb.<br>
Scheme 5<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula I can also exist in optical pure form. Separation into anti¬podes can be affected according methods known per se, either at an early stage of the syn¬thesis , e.g. starting with compounds of formula 11a by salt formation with an optically ac¬tive amine such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-l-phenylethylamine or (+)- or (-)-l-naphthyl-ethylamine and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallisation, or by derivatisation with a chiral auxiliary substance such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-2-butanol, (+)- or {-)-l-phenylethano), or (+}- or (-)-menthol and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallisation and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxiliary substance; or, on the very last stage, by separation of the enantiomers of formula I by chromatography on a chiral phase. Furthermore, compounds of formula I can a\sobe obtained &amp;om tsrasrtiopvi."ie vntome&amp;iates obtamtd t.7 biotransformation, e.g. by hydrolysis of esters of formula Via by enzymes, such as e.g. cholesterase from Candida cylindracea. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the pyrrolidinone deriva¬tive obtained, the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives can be analysed by conventional spectroscopic methods, e.g. with X-ray spectroscopy on single crystals.<br>
The Active Compounds are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer"s disease, other types of dementia, rninima] cognitive impairment or Parkinson"s disease. Other indica¬tions include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity, as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other<br><br>
addictive drugs. Other treatable indications may be peripheral neuropathy caused by can¬cer chemotherapy ("WO 97/33,572), reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34,172), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (WO 96/40,095), and other neuroinQammatory diseases.<br>
The Active Compounds are especially useful for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer"s disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNAs encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)]. After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 x g and, after two rinsing steps with 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, mem¬branes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80°C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectro-photometric assay adapted from the method described by Zhou and Panchuk-Voloshina [AnalyticalBiochemistry 253:169-174 (1997)]. Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C containing different con¬centrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/mi horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 uM N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 ul and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 uM clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 uM L-deprenyl for MAO-B. ICso values were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of preferred Active Compounds as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 1 uM or less, typically 0.1 uM or less, and ideally 0.02 uM or less.<br>
The Active Compounds can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form<br><br>
of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectaliy, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenteral!}*, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The Active Compounds can be processed with phaimaceuticatly inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, how¬ever, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the produc¬tion of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of Active Compounds, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabi¬lizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing an Active Compound and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the pro¬duction of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more Active Compound and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative there¬of. The abbreviation „RT" means „room temperature".<br><br>

It has been found that the compounds of general formula I and I* as well as individual isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof (hereinafter: Active Compounds) are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase {MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAQ-B, encoded by different genes [Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1983)] and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethyiamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al., J. Neural. Transm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer"s disease [Dostert et al., Bio-chem. Pharmacol. 38:555-561 (1989)] and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques [Saura et al., Neuroscience 70:755-774 (1994)]. In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NHj, aldehydes and H2Oj, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson"s disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopa¬minergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer"s and Parkinson"s diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO acti¬vity and consequent increased formation of Hj02 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibi¬tors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for<br><br>
example discussed by Bentue-Ferrer et al. [CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1995)]. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications [Gardner et a]., J. Qin. Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996)], these adverse events are of less concern with rever¬sible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br>

In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 comprising reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Amides of formula I" or VIb can be obtained by aminolysisof esters of formula lib or Via with amines of formula R -NHj at a temperature in the range of from room temperature (RT) and 120°C, e.g. in sealed tubes using solvents inert under these conditions, like e.g. dimethoxyethane, dioxane, or methanol. Al ternatively, acids of formula Ila may be trans¬formed into compounds of formula I** using standard procedures. They can be activated via, e.g., acid chloride or mixed anhydride. Especially for the preparation of enantiopure derivatives, condensation reagents like carbodiimides, e.g. dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide, or benzotriazol derivatives, e.g. 0-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronium-hexa-fluorophosphate (HBTU) may be applied.<br><br><br>
range of from 20°Cto reflux temperature. Another approach is theMitsunobu-coupling of benzylic alcohols with p-nitrophenols of formula XIV. The reaction is done as usual in inert solvents like for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofurane, using dialkyi azo-ciicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines like e.g. tributy]- or triphenyl-phosphine.<br><br><br><br>
The key intermediates of formula XVII can be reduced selectively to the amino-olefins of formula IVd using catalytic hydrogenation like e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the cata¬lyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofhrane as the solvent, or, by metals or metal salts, like e.g. thv(II)-chloride. The amino derivatives of formula FVccan be ob¬tained directly from the nitro derivatives of formula XVII or from the amino-olefins of formula IVd by hydrogenation using palladium on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alco¬hols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofbrane as the solvent.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula II can be reduced to the intermediate compound of formula III. This may be done by first converting the acids of formula II into their esters (alcohol / acid catalysis) followed by reduction with reagents like sodium borohydride in solvents like tetrahydrofurane at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to 65°C. Activa¬tion of the alcohol of formula III via mesylate or triflate and reaction with sodium or potassium cyanide at a temperature in the range of from 40°C to 80aC leads to the desired compounds of formula I wherein R3 is CH2CN, i.e. nitriles of formula lb.<br>
Scheme 5<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula I can also exist in optical pure form. Separation into Anti¬podes can be affected according methods known per se, either at an early stage of the syn¬thesis , e.g. starting with compounds of formula 11a by salt formation with an optically ac¬tive amine such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-l-phenylethylarnine or (+}- or (-)-l-naph,thyI-ethylamine and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallisation, or by derivatisation with a chiral auxiliary substance such as, for example, {+)- or C-)-2-butanol, (+)- or (-)-l-phenyiethanol, or (+)- or (-)-menthol and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallisation and subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxiliary substance; or, on the very last stage, by separation of the enantiomers of formula I by chromatography on a chiral phase. Furthermore, compounds of formula I can afso be obtained from enantiopure intermediates obtained by biotransformation, e.g. by hydrolysis of esters of formula Via by enzymes, such as e.g. cholesterase from Candida cylindmcea. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the pyrrolidinone deriva¬tive obtained, the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives can be analysed by conventional spectroscopic methods, e.g. with X-ray spectroscopy on single crystals.<br>
The Active Compounds are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer"s disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson"s disease. Other indica¬tions include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity, as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other<br><br>
addictive drugs. Other treatable indications may be peripheral neuropathy caused by can¬cer chemotherapy (WO 97/33,572), reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34,172), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (WO 96/40,095), and other neuroinflammaiory diseases.<br>
The Active Compounds are especially useful for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer"s disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNAs encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EfiNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)), After transfettioa, cells "weje^iOTaogenisedhyweans of apDlytxonhomogenizgj in 20 mM Tris Hd buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenyimethane_ sulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrihigation at 45,000 x g and, after two rinsing steps with 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, mem¬branes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80"C Until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity Was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectro-photometric assay adapted from the method described by Zhou and Panchuk-Voloshina [Analytical Biochemistry 253:169-174 (I997)]. Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C containing different con¬centrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition oftne MAO substrate fyramine together with 1 Ufod horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 uM N-acetyl^^-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 ul and absorbance was th^n determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 uM clot-gyline for MAO-A or 10 uM L-deprenyl for MAO-B. IC50 values were determined frc&gt;m inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of preferred Active Compounds as measured in the assay described above are in the range 0f 1 uM or less, typically 0.1 uM or less, anq ideally 0.02 [iM or less.<br>
The Active Compounds can be used as niedicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutic^ preparations. The pharmaceutical prepavations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form<br><br>
of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions Qr suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectaliy, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The Active Compounds can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and lidu"d polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, how-ever, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the produc¬tion of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, £an be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of Active Compounds, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural 01 hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabi¬lizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying tBe osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain oth£r therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing an Active Compound and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an ohject oi the present invention, as is a process for the pro¬duction of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more Active Compound and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, he fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parental administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 arid 700 mg per day.<br>
