COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE   :       DISPOSABLE SAFETY SYRINGE.<br><br>
APPLICANTS<br><br>
D'USSEL BERNARD<br>
60, RUE DE CAMBRONE,<br>
75015 PARIS,<br>
FRANCE<br>
A FRENCH NATIONAL<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner<br>
	in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
Title: Disposable safety syringe<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable so-<br>
called safety syringe.<br>
5	Disposable syringes that must be discarded after use<br>
have been developed to prevent contamination: such syringes generally include a pump body attached to the needle protected by a sheath before use. However, it has been realised that it is possible to refill these syringes and<br>
10 therefore to reuse them, whence serious risks of contamination.<br>
So, one aim of the present invention is to provide a disposable so-called safety syringe that cannot be refilled after it is first used.<br>
15	Another object of the invention is to provide a<br>
syringe of this kind which can be manufactured easily and at lower additional cost compared to existing disposable syringes.<br>
The above objects,  and others  that will  become<br>
20 apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a disposable so-called saxety syringe including a cylindrical pump body which is extended by a needle fastened to the body and which includes a plunger, which syringe is, in accordance with the invention, characterised in that the pump body<br>
25 comprises a proximal part fitted with the needle and a distal part of larger diameter including the plunger and in that the proximal part includes valve means.<br>
The valve means preferably comprise, on the one hand, a fixed member fastened to the inside wall of the proximal<br>
30 part and a mobile member between the fixed member and the outlet from the distal part into the proximal part.<br><br>
The fixed member advantageously consists of at least ono abutment, fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part of the pump body.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, 5   the fixed member includes at least two abutments regularly distributed on a common circle and fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part.<br>
The mobile member advantageously consists of a valve connected by pressure means to the inside wall of the 10   proximal part of the pump body.<br>
The valve preferably includes propulsion means cooperating with the pressure means.<br>
The valve is advantageously of cylindrical-conical<br>
shape, the conical part being directed towards the distal<br>
15   part of the pump body and the cylindrical part including<br>
the  propulsion  means  such  as  fins  disposed  at  its<br>
periphery.<br>
The  pressure  means  preferably  consist  of  a<br>
compression leaf spring one end of which is fastened to the<br>
20   base of the valve and the other end of which is fastened to<br>
the inside wall of the proximal part of the pump body, for<br>
example near the fixing of the needle into the latter.<br>
The following description, which is not limiting on the  invention,  must  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the 25   accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
j     - figure 1 is a plan view of a disposable so-called safety syringe in accordance with the present invention;<br>
- figure 2 is a view in section taken along the line<br>
II-II in figure 1, before any use of the syringe; and<br>
30	- figure 3 is a view in section taken along the line<br>
II-II in figure 1 after filling the syringe.<br><br>
As can be seen in the figures, a syringe includes a cylindrical pump body 1 fitted with a plunger 2 and a needle 3 fastened to the pump body 1.<br>
The pump body 1 has a proximal part 4 carrying the 5    needle 3 and a distal part 5 of larger diameter containing the plunger 2; the proximal part 4 includes valve means.<br>
' The valve means comprise, on the one hand, a fixed member 6 fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part 4 and a mobile member 7 that can move between this fixed<br>
10 member 6 and the outlet 8 of the distal part 5 into the proximal part 4.<br>
The fixed member 6 consists of at least one abutment fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part 4 of the pump body 1. In a preferred embodiment, the fixed member 6<br>
15 consists of two abutments 6a and 6b disposed symmetrically on a common circle on the inside wall of the proximal part 4.   .<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the mobile member consists of a valve 7 connected by pressure means 9<br>
20 to the inside wall of the proximal part 4. The valve 7 is of cylindrical-conical shape, the conical part 7a being directed towards the distal part 5 of the pump body 1 and the cylindrical part 7b including propulsion means such as fins 10 disposed at its periphery.<br>
25	The pressure means preferably consist of  a  leaf<br>
spring 9 one end of which is fastened to the base of the valve 7 and the other end of which is fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part 4 of the pump body 1, for example in the vicinity of the fixing of the needle 3<br>
30   therein: the leaf spring is of the compression type.<br><br>
When the syringe is empty, the valve 7 is held in posiition by the fins  10 cooperating with the abutments 6a and 6b, as shown in figure 2, the leaf spring holding the valve 7 pressed against the abutments. On actuating the 5 plunger 2 to fill the syringe, the aspirated liquid enters the needle 3 and then the proximal part 4 without lifting the valve 7 off the abutments 6a and 6b which form a seat, due in particular to the shape of the fins 10, so that it is able to enter the distal part 5 to the required level.<br>
10	During injection, the liquid pushed by the plunger 2<br>
creates a flow that exerts on the fins 10 of the valve 7 a force propelling the latter towards the outlet from the distal part 5 into the proximal part 4, the leaf spring 9 also contributing to this same movement. The thrust of the<br>
15 plunger 2 nevertheless remains sufficiently high to counterbalance positively the propulsion force exerted on the valve 7.<br>
When the injection is completed, the valve 7 is pressed against the outlet from the distal part 5 into the<br>
20 piroximal part 4 by the leaf spring 9, and is held pressed against it: it is therefore impossible to aspirate a liquid and thereby reuse a syringe in accordance with the present invention.<br><br><br>
1 	A disposable  safety syringe  <br>
cylindrical pump body (1)which is extended by a needle"" (3)<br>
fastened to said body (1) and which includes a plunger (2) and a<br>
proximal part (4) fitted with said needle (3) and a distal part<br>
(5) of larger diameter including said plunger (2), said maximal<br>
[sic] part (4) including valve means, characterised in that said<br>
valve means comprise, on the one hand, a fixed member (6)<br>
fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part (4) and a mobile<br>
member (7) between said fixed member (6) and the outlet (8) from<br>
the distal part (5) into said proximal part (4), said mobile<br>
member consisting of a valve (7) connected by a compression leaf<br>
spring (9) one end of which is fastened to the base of said valve<br>
(7) and the other end of which is fastened to the inside wall of<br>
said proximal part (4) of the pump body (1).<br>
2.	A syringe according to claim 1, characterised in that the fixed member (6) consists of at least one abutment fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part (4) of the pump body (1).<br>
3.	A syringe according to claim 2, characterised in that the fixed member includes at least two abutments (6a, 6b) regularly distributed on a common circle and fastened to the inside wall of the proximal part (4).<br>
4.	A syringe according to claim 3, characterised in that the valve (7) is of cylindrical-conical shape, the conical part (7a) being directed towards the distal part (5) of the pump body (1) and the cylindrical part (7b) including the propulsion means such as fins (10) disposed at its periphery.<br>
