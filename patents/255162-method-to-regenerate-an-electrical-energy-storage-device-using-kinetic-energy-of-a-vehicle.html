METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROL OF A TRANSMISSION<br>
TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCI I<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to a transmission device for a<br>
hybrid vehicle, and more specifically to controlling a torque-converter clutch<br>
of an automatic transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine and automatic<br>
transmission which provides motive torque to a driveline typically employs a<br>
torque converter device having a lock-up device referred to as a torque-<br>
converter clutch (TCC). The typical torque-converter clutch comprises a<br>
fluid-operated friction device which, when fully actuated, mechanically<br>
couples an input impeller and output turbine of a torque converter, to permit<br>
transmission of torque therebetween. The input impeller is typically<br>
mechanically attached to a crankshaft of the engine, and the output turbine is<br>
typically mechanically attached to an input shaft of the transmission.<br>
[0003] When the torque-converter clutch is fully actuated, engine torque<br>
perturbations can be passed directly to the vehicle driveline and hence to the<br>
vehicle. Vehicle calibrators typically generate torque-converter clutch<br>
apply/release calibrations, referred to as maps, that minimize driveline<br>
disturbances, referred to as NVH for 'noise, vibration, and harshness". ICC<br>
apply-releasc maps are typically calibrated using operator input of either<br>
accelerator pedal position or throttle position ('TPS'), and, vehicle speed.<br>
When TPS and vehicle speed are used as calibration inputs, opportunities to<br>
apply the torque-converter clutch are typically not maximized, because some<br>
TPS values result in both acceptable and unacceptable levels of NVH,<br>
depending on engine speed and load. When the TPS and vehicle speed art-<br>
used as calibration inputs, a single unacceptable NVH condition at a given<br><br>
2<br>
IPS and vehicle speed effectively prevents applying the torque-converter<br>
clutch at all load conditions at the specific TPS/vehicle speed point.<br>
[0004] Some vehicle systems implement hybrid powertrain systems which<br>
provide motive torque from the internal combustion engine, and arc able to<br>
utilize stored electrical energy to assist vehicle operation to obtain benefits<br>
related to reduced fuel consumption and reduced exhaust emissions. One such<br>
system is an Engine Stop-Start (ESS) system, which uses many conventional<br>
powertrain components and subsystems, and implements engine fuel cutoff<br>
and engine stop events during occurrences of decelerations and vehicle stops.<br>
The engine is subsequently restarted when the vehicle operator so commands.<br>
One exemplary ESS system relies upon a high-voltage battery system, a power<br>
inverter and a motor-generator to provide ESS functionality.<br>
[0005] Hybrid vehicle systems, including the ESS system, must ongoingly<br>
re-energize the vehicle electrical energy storage devices, which typically<br>
include high voltage battery systems or other electrical energy storage devices.<br>
Re-energizing the electrical energy storage devices can take the form ol'<br>
regeneration events, wherein electrical energy is derived from vehicle kinetic<br>
energy, and charging events wherein electrical energy is derived from vehicle<br>
engine power. Energy for charging typically comes from torque caused by<br>
engine rotation which drives an electric machine, i.e. a generator, which is<br>
operable to generate electrical energy for storage in the electrical energy<br>
storage device. Energy for regeneration typically comes from regenerative<br>
braking, wherein vehicle kinetic energy is captured by causing the drivcline to<br>
transmit torque through the powertrain to the electric machine.<br>
[0006] Electrical energy captured during regenerative braking is confined to<br>
that torque which can be transmitted through the entire powertrain to the<br>
electrical machine, which means an operating range in which the torque-<br>
converter clutch is in a lock mode or a controlled-slip mode. Referring now to<br>
Fig. 2, Line A shows a typical shift point from second to third gear of a four-<br>
speed automatic transmission, based upon vehicle speed and throttle position.<br><br>
J<br>
Line B represents a typical operating line for torque-converter clutch actuation<br>
based upon vehicle speed and throttle position for third gear. In the operating<br>
region to the right of line B, the torque-converter clutch is applied. In the<br>
operating region to the left of line B, the torque-converter clutch is open, or<br>
unlocked, and regenerative braking is disabled. As can be seen, there is a<br>
substantial operating region between Lines A and B in which the vehicle may<br>
operate, but in which regenerative braking may not occur due to limitations<br>
related to NVH and other concerns.<br>
[0007] There is a need to increase operating region of a torque-converter<br>
clutch on a vehicle employing regenerative braking in order to obtain the<br>
benefits thereof, without compromising vehicle NVH and other driveability<br>
concerns.<br>
SUMMARY OL THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] A method and system are offered which address the above-stated<br>
concerns and permits the vehicle to take more complete advantage of benefits<br>
achievable with broader operating region for torque-converter clutch<br>
application. The invention comprises a method and system to determine<br>
torque-converter clutch locking and unlocking based upon operator input,<br>
typically throttle position or accelerator pedal position, vehicle speed, and<br>
engine load, thus permitting more complete capture of energy during<br>
regenerative braking while managing driveline disturbances.<br>
[0009] In order to achieve the object of this invention, a method and an<br>
article of manufacture are provided which are operable to electrically<br>
regenerate an electrical energy storage device using kinetic energy ol' a<br>
vehicle. The exemplary vehicle has an internal combustion engine operably<br>
coupled to an electrical machine and to a torque converter operably coupled to<br>
a transmission device. The vehicle kinetic energy is transmittable to the<br>
electrical machine electrically connected to the electrical energy storage<br>
device. The method comprises monitoring an operator demand for power.<br><br>
4<br>
operating speed of the vehicle, and, an engine load. A locking clutch for the<br>
torque converter is actuated based upon the operator demand for power, the<br>
vehicle operating speed, and, the engine load.<br>
[0010] An aspect of the invention includes actuating the locking clutch for<br>
the torque converter when the engine load is less than a first calibrated engine<br>
load, wherein the first calibrated engine load is determined based upon the<br>
operator demand for power and the vehicle operating speed.<br>
[0011] Another aspect of the invention includes deactivating the actuated<br>
locking clutch for the torque converter when the engine load is greater than a<br>
second calibrated engine load, the second calibrated engine load determined<br>
based upon the operator demand for power and the vehicle operating speed.<br>
[0012] Another aspect of the invention includes the first calibrated engine<br>
load greater than the second calibrated engine load at each monitored operator<br>
demand for power and each monitored vehicle operating speed.<br>
[0013] Another aspect of the invention includes deactivating the actuated<br>
locking clutch for the torque converter at a vehicle speed less than a calibrated<br>
transmission shift vehicle speed when the operator demand for power is below<br>
a predetermined power threshold and the engine load is below the second<br>
calibrated engine load.<br>
[0014] Another aspect of the invention includes actuating the locking clutch<br>
for the torque converter such that clutch slip is substantially nil, and, actuating<br>
the locking clutch for the torque converter such that there is a controlled clutch<br>
slip less than a predetermined amount of slip.<br>
[0015] Another aspect of the invention includes actuating the locking clutch<br>
for the torque converter based upon the operator demand for power, the engine<br>
operating speed, the engine load, and, barometric pressure, and, operation of a<br>
cruise control system.<br>
[0016] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br><br>

invention; and,<br>
[0020] Figs. 3 and 4 are exemplary datagraphs. in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0021] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings arc for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 shows a schematic drawing of a vehicle propulsion system<br>
including an exemplary internal combustion engine and control system which<br>
has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The exemplary system, described as a belt-driven alternator/starter<br>
('BAS') system, comprises a powertrain system having internal combustion<br>
engine 20, a transmission 24 with torque converter 22, a motor-generator unit<br>
34, and a Power Electronics Box ('PEB') 36, each signally and/or operably<br>
connected to a distributed control system via a local area network (LAN) bus<br>
6. The distributed control system comprises an engine control module (ECM)<br>
10, a transmission control module (TCM) 12. a brake control module (BCM)<br>
14, an energy storage control module (ESCM) 18, and a heating-ventilation-air<br>
conditioning controller (HVAC) 16, among others.<br>
[0022] The powertrain system includes the internal combustion engine 20<br>
operable to provide tractive power to drive wheels 28 using known power<br>
transmission devices including the torque converter 22, including a torque<br><br>
6<br>
converter clutch or TCC (not shown), the transmission 24, and a vehicle<br>
driveline 26, typically comprising a transaxle for a front wheel drive vehicle,<br>
or, alternatively, a rear differential unit for a rear wheel drive vehicle, or other<br>
known devices for delivering power to vehicle wheels. Alternatively, the<br>
vehicle is operable to transmit vehicle kinetic energy input as torque through<br>
the vehicle driven wheels 28, through vehicle driveline 26 to the transmission<br>
24, torque-converter 22, and engine 20 to a bi-directional accessory belt drive<br>
system 32 and motor-generator unit 34.<br>
[0023] The motor-generator unit ('MGU') 34 comprises an electrical<br>
machine operable to act as a torque-generative device and as an electrical-<br>
generative device, preferably depending upon vehicle operation and a control<br>
signal from the controller 10 to the Power Electronics Box ("PEB") 36. and<br>
other control signals. The FEB 36 includes the functions of a Power Inverter<br>
Module (PIM) and Auxiliary Power Module (APM), and is electrically<br>
coupled to the MGU 34 and a high-voltage ('HV') battery 40, preferably<br>
operating at 36/42 Vlx, and a conventional twelve-volt battery 38. to<br>
selectively transmit electrical energy therebetween. The PEB is operable to<br>
control operation of an electrically-powered auxiliary oil pump 30 fluidly<br>
attached to a hydraulic circuit of the transmission 24 to provide pressurized<br>
fluid in the hydraulic circuit during specific operating conditions, including<br>
engine shutdown and vehicle shutdown. It is understood that the high voltage<br>
battery 40 and the conventional twelve-volt battery 38 may comprise any one<br>
of various devices operable to provide electrical energy storage capacity on<br>
the vehicle.<br>
[0024] The internal combustion engine 20 is operably attached to the bi-<br>
directional accessory belt drive system 32, preferably at an engine crankshaft<br>
(not shown). The bi-directional accessory belt drive system 32 operates in a<br>
first operating condition, comprising an electrical energy generating mode and<br>
in a second operating condition, comprising a torque-generating mode. In the<br>
first, electrical energy generating mode, the internal combustion engine 20<br><br>
7<br>
provides torque to the accessory belt drive system 32, transferring power and<br>
energy to motor-generator unit 34 ('MGU') and other accessories. In the first<br>
mode the MGU 34 functions as the electrical energy generative device to<br>
replenish or charge the electrical energy storage system comprising the high-<br>
voltage ('HV') battery 40 and the twelve-volt battery 38, using torque<br>
generated by the engine 20 and/or kinetic energy from the vehicle. In the<br>
second, torque-generating mode, the MGU 34 functions as an electrical motor<br>
to generate torque which is transmitted to the internal combustion engine 20<br>
via the accessory belt drive system 32 to start engine operation, using<br>
electrical energy stored in the electrical energy storage system. The MGU 34<br>
may further function as the electrical motor to generate torque that is<br>
transmitted to the engine 20 to stabilize engine operation and provide torque<br>
damping to the vehicle driveline.<br>
[0025] The distributed control system comprising an integrated vehicle<br>
control system wherein the controllers, including ECM 10, TCM 12, BCM 14,<br>
HVAC 16 are signally connected via LAN 6 to accomplish various tasks.<br>
Each of the aforementioned control processors is preferably a general-purpose<br>
digital computer generally including a microprocessor or central processing<br>
unit, ROM, RAM, and I/O including A/D and D/A. Each control processor<br>
includes a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions<br>
and calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective<br>
functions. Information transfer between the various control processors is<br>
preferably accomplished by way of the aforementioned LAN.<br>
[0026] The distributed vehicle control system is signally attached to a<br>
plurality of sensing devices and operably connected to a plurality of output<br>
devices to ongoingly monitor and control operation of the engine 20, the<br>
transmission 24, and the MGU 34 and the PEB 36. This includes monitoring<br>
conditions of the HV battery 40, and, determining state of charge of the HV<br>
battery 40. The controlled output devices preferably include subsystems Im-<br>
proper control and operation of the engine 20, including, by way of example.<br><br>
8<br>
an air intake system including a throttle control system, a fuel injection<br>
system, a spark-ignition system (when a spark-ignition engine is used), an<br>
exhaust gas recirculation system, and an evaporative control system. The<br>
sensing devices (not shown) include devices operable to monitor engine<br>
operation, including engine crankshaft speed (RPM), and engine load,<br>
comprising manifold pressure ('MAP') and/or airflow ('MAI'"). The L;CM 10<br>
is preferably operable to regularly determine an engine operating point based<br>
upon the monitored engine operation. Other sensors include those operable to<br>
monitor external conditions, and operator demand, and are typically signally<br>
attached to the system controller 10 via wiring harnesses. Operator inputs<br>
include an operator demand for power, as determined by a position of<br>
accelerator pedal 4 or throttle position sensor (not shown), as well as operator<br>
input to a brake pedal (demand for vehicle deceleration or braking) and<br>
operator input to a cruise-control device (demand for consistent vehicle<br>
speed).<br>
[0027] Control algorithms in each of the control processors arc typically<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each control algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by the respective central processing unit and arc<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed each 3.125, 6.25. 12.5, 25 and<br>
100 milliseconds during engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, control<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an event. A cyclical<br>
event, e.g. calculating engine fueling, may be executed each engine cycle. An<br>
action to start the engine 20 after it is turned off is preferably executed in<br>
response to an event, e.g. an operator demand for acceleration which is<br>
detected by monitoring operator input to accelerator pedal 4. Alternatively,<br>
the action to start the engine 20 after it is turned off may be a quasi-cyclic<br>
event, wherein the powertrain controller 10 cyclically monitors vehicle<br><br>
9<br>
conditions such ambient air temperature, and implements an engine start event<br>
on a subsequent loop cycle in order to provide additional functionality.<br>
[0028] The integrated vehicle control system is signally connected to the<br>
aforementioned sensors and other sensing devices, and operably connected to<br>
output devices to monitor and control engine and vehicle operation. The<br>
output devices preferably include subsystems providing for proper control and<br>
operation of the vehicle, including the engine, transmission, and brakes. The<br>
sensing devices providing signal input to the vehicle include devices operable<br>
to monitor vehicle operation, external and ambient conditions, and operator<br>
commands.<br>
[0029] In overall operation, the ECM 10 sends control commands to the FEB<br>
36 in the form of torque, speed, or voltage-control commands, depending on<br>
the desired hybrid function. The PEB broadcasts key control parameters such<br>
as motor speed, delivered torque, temperature, and diagnostics. The ESCM 18<br>
monitors key inputs to support hybrid battery (i.e. ITV battery 40) state<br>
optimization, in addition to supporting automatic fan and disconnect control.<br>
The ECM and the TCM interact to coordinate gear-shift and TCC operation to<br>
maximize fuel economy and optimize driveability. I^ach of these control<br>
actions are preferably executed while integrating operation of the BCM and<br>
the HVAC. Hybrid powertrain operations of the exemplary system preferably<br>
include engine start/stop; fuel-cut during vehicle deceleration using the<br>
electrical machine 34 to provide smoothing of driveline torque; control of<br>
battery charge/discharge; regenerative braking; electrical power assist; and,<br>
electrically motored creep.<br>
[0030] The internal combustion engine 20 comprises any one of a number<br>
of known internal combustion engine configurations, including by way of<br>
example, a four-cylinder, four-cycle spark-ignition engine. Its operation is<br>
primarily controlled by the ECM 10.<br><br>
10<br>
[0031] The exemplary transmission preferably comprises a known clutch-to-<br>
clutch four-speed automatic transmission device operable to transmit torque<br>
between the engine and torque converter and the driveline. The transmission<br>
24 has a plurality of gear ratios typically providing transmission input/output<br>
speed ratios ranging from about 3.0/1 to 0.74/1. Its operation is controlled<br>
primarily by the TCM 12.<br>
[0032] The torque converter 22 includes known torque-converter clutch (not<br>
shown) which is lockable. The torque-converter clutch is controllable to an<br>
open position, a locked position, and a controlled-slip condition. When the<br>
torque-converter clutch is in the locked position, the input rotational speed to<br>
the transmission 24 is equal to engine rotational speed, typically measured as<br>
rotational speed of the engine crankshaft, in revolutions per minute, or 'RPMWhen the torque-converter clutch is in the controlled-slip condition, the input<br>
rotational speed to the transmission 24 is within a specific rotational speed oi'<br>
the engine rotational speed, typically a difference of around twenty RPM.<br>
When the torque-converter clutch is in the open position, there is no fixed<br>
relationship between the input rotational speed to the transmission 24 and the<br>
engine rotational speed. The torque-converter clutch is typically controlled by<br>
a solenoid-type actuator that is controlled by the TCM 12.<br>
[0033] The TCM 12 preferably includes control algorithms and<br>
predetermined calibrations useable to control ongoing operation of the<br>
transmission 24 and torque-converter clutch 22, preferably in coordination<br>
with other control processors. The transmission calibration preferably<br>
includes a predetermined gear shifting pattern which controls gear shifting<br>
within the transmission based upon operator torque requests comprising<br>
inputs to the accelerator pedal, engine operating speed, and vehicle speed.<br>
In a system equipped with electronic throttle control, wherein there is the<br>
accelerator pedal 4 which sends an electrical signal to operate a throttle<br>
motor, the accelerator pedal position (APS) is effectively decoupled from<br>
position of the throttle (TPS). For example, there can be a low value for<br><br>
11<br>
APS, and a large value for TPS, and engine load (MAP) depending on the<br>
vehicle speed and operator transient actions to the APS. Also, during an<br>
accelerator tip-in event there can be a small value for APS and a large value<br>
for TPS and MAP, whereas under quasi-static operation there can be a low<br>
value for APS as the operator slowly tips out of the throttle (but not to APS<br>
= 0) coupled with a low value for MAP.<br>
[0034] Referring again to Pig. 1, and referring also to Pigs. 2-4, an<br>
embodiment of the invention is now detailed, wherein the previously<br>
described vehicle propulsion system operates as detailed herein. The<br>
distributed vehicle control system includes a computer program encoded<br>
therein for effecting a method to regenerate the electrical energy storage<br>
device using kinetic energy of the vehicle. As described herein, regenerating<br>
the electrical energy storage device using kinetic energy of the vehicle is<br>
distinguishable from charging the electrical energy storage device in that the<br>
energy for regenerating is derived from vehicle kinetic energy, whereas<br>
energy for charging the electrical energy storage device is derived from<br>
power generated by operation of the internal combustion engine. The<br>
computer program comprises monitoring an operator demand for power,<br>
preferably using input to the accelerator pedal 4. and, vehicle speed.<br>
Furthermore, engine load is determined, preferably by monitoring engine<br>
manifold absolute pressure (in kPa), using the MAP sensor previously<br>
referenced. The torque-converter clutch or TCC is actuated based upon the<br>
operator demand for power, the vehicle operating speed, and, the engine<br>
load. Actuating TCC comprises actuating the locking clutch for the torque<br>
converter when the engine load is less than a first calibrated engine load,<br>
which is determinable based upon the operator demand for power and the<br>
vehicle operating speed. The TCC actuation is shown with reference now to<br>
Figs. 2 and 3, which comprise representative data graphs having exemplary<br>
calibrations for actuating the torque-converter clutch in third gear of the<br><br>
12<br>
exemplary vehicle system described above. Fig. 2 demonstrates a calibration<br>
for the actuating the TCC when the operator demand for power or torque,<br>
APS, is less than a predetermined level for a specific vehicle speed. Line C<br>
demonstrates the calibration values for operator demand for power, and<br>
vehicle speed. A final decision by the vehicle control system to actuate the<br>
TCC is further based upon engine load, as shown in Fig. 3, which<br>
demonstrates TCC lock (i.e. actuated), a controlled slip, and TCC open (i.e.<br>
deactivated) for third gear operation over a range of vehicle speeds. The<br>
actuated TCC is subsequently deactivated at an operating point determined<br>
when the engine load is greater than a second calibrated engine load<br>
determinable , the second calibrated engine load determined based upon the<br>
operator demand for power and the vehicle operating speed. The first<br>
calibrated engine load is preferably greater than the second calibrated engine<br>
load at each monitored operator demand for power and each monitored<br>
vehicle operating speed. Although described, this actuation/deactivation<br>
hysteresis is not shown graphically. A specific feature of the control system<br>
as described is shown with reference to Fig. 2, wherein the TCC can remain<br>
actuated (Line C) at a vehicle speed less than a calibrated transmission shift<br>
vehicle speed (Line A) when the operator demand for power is below a<br>
predetermined power threshold and the engine load is below the second<br>
calibrated engine load. The operation of the system is now explained with<br>
reference to Figs 2 and 3, wherein operation of the exemplary system is<br>
described in further detail.<br>
[0035] Figs. 3 and 4 comprise representative data graphs having exemplary<br>
calibrations for controlling locking of the torque-converter clutch. Fig. 3<br>
shows the calibration for operation of the exemplary transmission 24 in third<br>
gear. Fig. 4 shows the calibration for operation of the exemplary<br>
transmission 24 in fourth gear. The calibration controls locking of the<br>
torque-converter clutch in a locked position, a controlled-slip condition, and<br><br>
13<br>
also controls opening of the TCC, as shown in both lugs. 3 and 4. When the<br>
TCC is locked, operation of the torque-converter clutch is determined based<br>
upon vehicle speed (kph) and engine load (MAP). When the engine load is<br>
less than, or above, the TCC-lock calibration line, the torque-converter<br>
clutch is actuated, permitting regenerative braking. When the engine load is<br>
greater than the TCC-open calibration line, i.e., below the TCC-lock<br>
calibration line but above the TCC-open calibration line, the torque-<br>
converter clutch is actuated in a controlled slip operation, and regenerative<br>
braking may continue to occur. When the engine load is greater than the<br>
TCC-open calibration line, the TCC is open, and regenerative braking does<br>
not occur.<br>
[0036] Referring again to Fig. 2, Line A comprises an exemplary<br>
conventional calibration line for shifting between second and third gears,<br>
based upon vehicle speed (kilometers per hour, or kph) and the operator<br>
torque request, which is the previously described APS. Line B comprises an<br>
exemplary conventional, prior art calibration line for applying the torque-<br>
converter clutch, for operation in third gear, as a function of vehicle speed<br>
(in kph) and the operator torque request, APS. Line C shows the calibration<br>
line for applying the torque-converter clutch that has been adjusted by adding<br>
the dimension of engine load, or MAP, in accordance with the invention.<br>
Torque converter clutch calibration Line C demonstrates an expanded<br>
operating range for the TCC, especially at low levels of operator torque<br>
requests. This includes an ability to have the TCC actuated or enabled<br>
across the 2-3 shift point (shown with reference to Line A) when the<br>
operator torque request is low. This expands potential operating range of the<br>
TCC, thus permitting greater opportunity for the vehicle to engage in<br>
regenerative braking.<br>
[0037] An example operating point in accordance with the invention is<br>
shown at point L, wherein the transmission operating in third gear at a<br><br>
14<br>
vehicle speed of about 48 kph, and a throttle position or APS of about fifteen<br>
percent. In this situation, as shown with reference to the calibration in Fig.<br>
3, operation of the torque-converter clutch is based upon engine load (MAP).<br>
In a prior art, conventional control system, shown with reference to Line B<br>
of Fig. 2, the TCC would not be actuated. In a load-based TCC lock<br>
calibration, shown with reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, The TCC may be<br>
actuated. In this situation, with reference specifically to Fig. 3, actuating the<br>
TCC would be based upon engine load. When the engine load was 50 kPa<br>
or less, the TCC would be locked. When the engine load was between 50<br>
kPa and about 90 kPa, a controllcd-slip condition would occur. Bach of the<br>
aforementioned conditions would permit some level of regenerative braking.<br>
Only when the engine load was greater than about 90 kPa would the TCC be<br>
open, thus not permitting any form of regenerative braking to occur.<br>
10038] Thus, operator input, in the form of throttle position or accelerator<br>
pedal position, vehicle speed, and engine load are each used to determine<br>
whether to actuate the torque-converter clutch. Once activated, the torque<br>
converter clutch is deactivated when any one of the operator demand lor<br>
power, the vehicle speed, or the engine load falls outside calibrated values.<br>
[0039] In a further enhancement to the invention, hysteresis is introduced<br>
in the system, wherein the control system is calibrated so the operator input,<br>
the vehicle speed and engine load threshold levels required for initially<br>
locking the torque-converter clutch are greater than threshold levels required<br>
for unlocking the locked torque-converter clutch. This hysteresis is<br>
preferably applied to the operator input, i.e. the operator demand for power,<br>
although it can be applied to any of vehicle speed, engine load, and operator<br>
input.<br>
[0040] Preferably, actuating the torque converter clutch includes actuating<br>
the locking clutch at a vehicle/engine operating point wherein clutch slip is<br>
substantially nil, i.e. there is no difference in rotational speed between the<br><br>
15<br>
output of the engine crankshaft and the input to the transmission. Actuating<br>
the locking clutch for the torque converter may also include actuating the<br>
locking clutch for the torque converter such that there is a controlled clutch<br>
slip less than a predetermined amount of slip, for an amount of time, with a<br>
difference in the range of twenty revolutions per minute (20 RPM) between<br>
the engine crankshaft speed and the speed of the input shaft to the<br>
transmission.<br>
|0041] The system further includes actuating the locking clutch for the<br>
torque converter based upon the operator demand for power, the vehicle<br>
speed, the engine load, and, barometric pressure and operation of the cruise<br>
control system. This operation preferably includes the MAP or load<br>
thresholds having applied to them a factor for barometric pressure,<br>
determinable by the ECM using the MAP sensor, and compensation for<br>
operating the cruise-control system. In an exemplary system, for throttle<br>
response at high altitudes, the MAP threshold at which the TCC is slipped or<br>
opened is preferably lowered by a predetermined value based upon<br>
barometric pressure. Similarly, the MAP threshold is preferably lowered by<br>
a predetermined value when cruise control is enabled to enhance speed<br>
controllability on a graded road surface.<br>
[0042] Detailed aspects of the aforementioned componentry of the<br>
exemplary embodiment is known to a skilled practitioner, although it is<br>
understood that alternate embodiments using novel componentry may fall<br>
within the scope of the invention described herein. Although this is<br>
described in context of a vehicle having a BAS hybrid system, it is<br>
understood that alternate embodiments of this invention can include other<br>
vehicle systems having hybrid and non-hybrid configurations with fixed gear<br>
transmissions and locking torque converters. This includes vehicle systems<br>
operable to translate vehicle kinetic energy to electrical energy potential.<br><br>
16<br>

preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
