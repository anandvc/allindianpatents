				<td>CATHETER COMPOSITION AND USES THEREOF<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of indwelling medical devices, in particular catheters, as well as to the field of methods and compositions for flushing, locking, priming, and coating these medical devices. The invention also relates ho pharmaceutical preparations useful in increasing catheter flow and preventing infection in catheters with the potential for fibrin deposition or with preexisting fibrin-bound clots. Description of Related Disclosures<br>
Delivery systems are widely used in medicine as a means for introducing liquid material that might include medicaments, nutrition, or other active agents to a particular locus in a patient. Such systems frequently involve the use of catheters, which, for many applications, are surgically or intravenously located and stitched into place for long-term administration of the desired material. Typical systems include central catheters such as may be used for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) used in, e.g., short bowel syndrome (for the duration of life), with the risk of sepsis or endocarditis. Such systems also include catheters and drains that are involved in peritoneal dialysis for those with terminal kidney failure, which, if infected, can lead to peritonitis with serious consequences.<br>
Intravascular catheters are among the most commonly used medical devices. Such catheters are routinely placed into a patient's vascular system for many procedures and often are left in place for extended periods. One type of delivery system used for some years in the treatment of conditions in humans comprises a reservoir or chamber of small volume subcutaneously implanted under the fascia having direct access via a catheter to the cardiovascular system. Such systems are known as port systems. Since a port and an intravascular catheter are direct paths from<br>
1<br><br>
the outside environment to the patient' s bloodstream, the presence of the catheter or port presents a substantial and continuous potential for introduction of microorganisms into the patient's bloodstream.<br>
It is now generally acknowledged that indwelling catheterization in medical, surgical, gynecological, urological and other patients can lead to serious infection of the urogenital tract. Practitioners have developed many protocols related to placement, use, attachment and detachment of fluid-handling devices and other procedures related to catheters. The goal of almost all of these procedures is to avoid introduction of a microorganism into the patient's bloodstream.<br>
A number of methods for reducing the risk of infection have-been developed that incorporate anti-infective agents into medical devices, none of which have been clinically proven to be completely satisfactory. Such devices desirably provide effective levels of anti-infective agent during the entire period that the device is being used. This sustained release may be problematic to achieve, in that a mechanism for dispersing anti-infective agent over a prolonged period of time may be required, and the incorporation of sufficient amounts of anti-infective agent may adversely affect the surface characteristics of the device. The difficulties encountered in providing effective anti-microbial protection increase with the development of drug-resistant pathogens.<br>
The current standard care of vascular catheters includes flushing the lumen of the catheter with an anti-coagulant, such as heparin, to prevent blood in and around the tip of the catheter from coagulating and obstructing the flow of fluids through the catheter. Furthermore, heparin has no anti-microbial activity, and, in addition, if not carefully controlled, it can carry the anti-coagulation process too far, thereby presenting a risk of hemorrhage. Heparin can also result in antibody formation, leading to a serious autoimmune condition of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which depletes platelets and further increases risk of bleeding. Thus, infections, as well as thrombotic occlusion,  continue to occur frequently despite the<br>
2<br><br>
prophylactic use of heparin flushes. Knowledge of the pathogenesis and microbiology of central venous catheter-related infections is essential to provide effective prevention of this problem.<br>
Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus account for 75% of central venous catheter (CVC)-related infections. Candida species account for another 10% to 15% of such infections. The use of ant ±-s taphylococcal antibiotics to prevent these infections has been found to reduce CVC-related bacterial infections, but only at the expense of the occurrence of higher rates of fungal (Candida.) infections.       -- ~<br>
There is also an observed correlation between thrombogenesis and infection. Essentially, a fibrin sheath that subsequently acts to cover the internal and external surfaces of a catheter engulfs indwelling vascular catheters. This fibrin sheath provides such organisms as Staphylococci and Candida with an enhanced adherence capacity to the catheter surface. Unlike these particular microbes, gram-negative bacilli do not adhere well to fibrin and fibronectin. A composition that halted fibrin formation would thus be particularly useful in preventing the colonization of Staphylococci, Candida, and the like, at indwelling catheter sites.<br>
When a medicament is introduced into a patient through a catheter, the practitioner commonly follows the introduction with a flush solution that may include an anticoagulant such as heparin. The purpose of the flush solution is to move the medicament out of the catheter so that the entire dosage is delivered, and to leave a residual fill in the catheter so that the patient's blood does not back up in the catheter and possibly form a clot that would occlude the bore of the catheter. Thus, when the catheter is subsequently needed again, the properly flushed catheter is likely fully patent and ready for the next usage.<br>
Root efc al. , Antimicrob. Acrents Chemother. , 32: 1627-1631 (1988) published a study that reported on the effect in catheters of disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) , a compound well known for its chelating properties in vivo and widely used as<br>
3<br><br>
an anticoagulant in vitro.  U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,754 disclosed that pharmaceutical compositions of a mixture of minocycline and EDTA were useful in maintaining the patency of a catheter port.  U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,442 described tubular articles, such as condoms and catheters, which are rendered anti-mi cr obi ally effective by the incorporation  of a non-ionic  sparingly  soluble anti-microbial agent,  such as  triclosan.    The anti-microbial  agent may be distributed throughout the article, or in a coating thereon.  U.S. Pat. No.  5,362,754 disclosed a pharmaceutical preparation that includes minocycline and EDTA for maintaining the patency of a catheter.  U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,754 reported the use of a mixture of minocycline and EDTA  (M-EDTA)  to maintain the patency of a catheter port.<br>
Purchase et al. , Nephron, 58: 119-20 (1991) disclosed use of calcium chelators, including citrate, for this purpose. Butuovic et al., Artif. Organs. 22: 945-7 (1998) disclosed that citrate and polygeline, which is a plasma substitute made from cow bones, were equally as effective as heparin in maintaining the catheter. In a talk presented at the 3 0th annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology, held Nov. 2-5, 1997 in San Antonio, Tex., Sodemann et al. reported that the replacement of catheters due to infection^ can be avoided by routine application of the concentrated gentamicin/citrate mixture.<br>
However, one citrate calcium chelator for dialysis catheters, designated TRICITRASOL™, has certain drawbacks. Some patients reported dysgensia for a short period immediately after the injection of citrate. Recently the FDA reported a case of a patient who died shortly after the injection of citrate as a catheter lock (Stas et al., Nephrol Dial Transplant, 16: 1521-1522 (2001) ; FDA issues warning on tricitrasol (trademark) dialysis catheter anticoagulant.  FDA Talk Paper T00-16, 14 April 2000.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,096 disclosed infection-resistant medical devices comprising a synergistic combination of a silver salt (such as silver sulfadiazine) and chlorhexidine. U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,640 reported on polymeric medical articles comprising the anti-infective agents, chlorhexidine and triclosan. U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,754 disclosed preventing glycocalyx formation on a catheter<br>
4<br><br>
by coating with EDTA and/or minocycline, preventing bacterial and fungal infections. U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,797 disclosed combating infection or sepsis in catheter and port systems by using an antimicrobial  locking solution of  taurolidine  or taurultam.<br>
U.S.      Pat.     No.      6,166,007     disclosed     anti-microbial      locks comprising    taurinamide    derivatives    and    carboxylic     acids     and/or salts   thereof   for preventing   infection  and  blood coagulation   in  or near    a    medical    prosthetic     device    after     the    device    has     been inserted    in    a    patient.         EP    1,040,841     described    prevention    of thrombosis      formation      and/or     bacterial      growth      on     a      liquid-contacting   surface   of   a   delivery  system  by   contacting   the   surface with   a   thrombosis-preventing   liquid  having   anti-coagulant    agent, taurolidine,     and/or    taurultam.        EP   882,461    disclosed   a    medical device     having     both     physiological     and     anti-microbial     activity comprising a  base material,   a  crosslinked  coating   film  formed  on  a surface   of   the  base material,   and  each  of   a  physiologically   active substance   and   an   anti-microbial   substance   bonded   to    the    coating film.<br>
Boorgu efc al. , ASAIO J. , 46 (6) : 767-770 (Nov. 2000) published on an adjunctive antibiotic/anticoagulant lock therapy in the treatment of bacteremia associated with the use of a subcutaneously implanted hemodialysis access device. Attached to the device are two catheters that are implanted into the superior vena cava or right atrium. An antibiotic/anticoagulant lock therapy entailed the instillation of both an antibiotic and an anticoagulant into the device. See also Schwartz et al. , Journal of Clinical Oncology., 8(9) :1591-1597 (1990) and Kamal et al. , JAMA,   265(18):2364-2368    (1991).<br>
Wiernikowski et al. , Am J. Pediatr Hematol Oncol. ,13(2): 137-<br>
140 (1991) disclosed that bacteriostatic saline flush solutions<br>
prevented catheter infections compared to normal saline.<br>
Vercaigne et al. , Pharmacotherapy, 20: 394-9 (2000) evaluated<br>
heparin plus antibiotics as a locking solution to prevent<br>
infection.	Patel     et     al. ,      Thromb    Hemost,      82:      1205-6      (1999)<br>
disclosed successful use of low-dose r-hirudin for recurrent dialysis catheter thrombosis in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.      Darouiche   et   al.,   Nutrition,   13.(4) (suppl) :   26S-<br>
5<br><br>
29S  (1997)  reported that the prevention of vascular catheter-related  infection can be achieved using  anti-microbial  agents involving  the  application  of  topical  disinfectants  such  as chlorhexidine, use of silver-impregnated subcutaneous cuffs  (for short-term CVCs),  flushing of catheters, with a combination of anti-microbial  and  anti-thrombotic  agents,  and  coating  of catheters  with  either  antiseptic  (chlorhexidine  and  silver sulfadiasine) or anti-microbial agents (minocycline and rifampin) . Antibacterial lock solutions have been used to clean out catheters.   For example,  U.S.  Pat.  No.  6,174,537  disclosed a catheter flush solution.  See also Sodermann et al. Blood Purif - , 19: 251-254 (2001) on DIALOCK™ and CLS;  the TUBEX™ Heparin Lock Flush Solution  (Wyeth-Ayerst) ;  and Henrickson et  al.,  J.  Clin Oncol..,   .18:  1269-1278  (2000)  on  prevention  of  CVC-related infections   and   thrombotic   events   using   vancomycin/cipro-floxacin/heparin flush solution.<br>
Soft-cuffed, implantable CVCs such as' the QUINTON PERMCATH™ CVC (Quinton Instrument Co., Seattle, WA) are increasingly used in patients with end-stage renal disease as a means of permanent access. Their major limitations, besides infection, are thrombosis and inadequate blood flow. To prevent those complications, heparin is conventionally used for priming the QUINTON PERMCATH™ CVC between dialysis sessions. Schenk et al. , Amer. J. Kidney Diseases, 35: 130-136 (Jan. 2 000) showed that recombinant  tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was superior to heparin for priming the QUINTON PERMCATH™ CVC between hemodialysis sessions. However, Schenk et al. utilized 2 mg of alteplase plus SWFI (sterile water for injection, USP) , which does not prevent growth of bacteria.<br>
Central venous access device (CVAD) occlusions or blockages due to formation- of a blood clot (thrombus) within or at the tip of the CVAD catheter are a common problem that can block the administration of therapies to patients. Estimates suggest that 25% of CVADs become occluded, with thrombosis as the most common etiology (Haire et al., Thromb. Haemost, 72: 543-547 (1994) ; Rubin, J. Clin. Oncol., 1: 572-573 (1983); Lokich et al. , J. Clin Oncol- ,  3_:  710-717  (1985)).     In 1994,  Haire  et al. ,  supra,<br>
6<br><br>
performed a double-blind, prospective, randomized trial of urokinase versus alteplase {t-PA) in dysfunctional catheters proven radiographically to be occluded by thrombus. Catheters were treated with 2 mg of alteplase or 10,000 U of urokinase that was allowed to dwell in the device for 2 hours. After up to two treatments, alteplase restored function in more catheters than urokinase (89% versus 59% (p - 0.013}).<br>
On September 4, 2001 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the thrombolytic agent CATHFLO™ ACTIVASE® (alteplase) t-PA, for the restoration of function to CVADs, as assessed by the ability to withdraw blood. CATHFLO™ ACTIVASE® t-PA is available in a 2-mg, single-patient-use vial, is the only marketed thrombolytic available for this indication, and offers medical professionals a viable treatment option for a CVAD complication that can hinder patient care. One vial of CATHFLO™ t-PA contains 2.2 mg of alteplase, 77 mg of L-arginine, 0.2 mg of POLYSORBATE 80™ emulsifier, and phosphoric acid to adjust the pH to approximately 7.3.<br>
T-PA Has been bonded to other materials than vascular-catheters. See, for example, Zhou et al. , J. Control Release, 55: 281-295 (1998); Greco et al. , Ann Vase. Surg, 9: 140-145 (1995) and Woodhouse et al., Biomaterials, 17: 75-77 (1996).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,516 disclosed use of selected combinations of a chelating agent, anticoagulant, or anti-thrombotic agent, with a non-glycopeptide anti-microbial agent, such as the tetracycline antibiotics, to coat a medical device and to inhibit catheter infection. Preferred combinations include minocycline or another non-glycopeptide anti-microbial agent together with EDTA, EGTAT, DTPA, TTH, heparin, and/or hirudin in a pharonaceutically acceptable diluent- U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,768 similarly disclosed use of an anti-microbial agent and an anticoagulant, an anti-thrombotic agent, or a chelating agent to maintain the patency of indwelling medical devices such as catheters and for preventing infections caused by bacterial growth in catheters.<br>
Notwithstanding the above-described contributions to the art, a need continues to exist for a non-toxic method for removal of<br>
7<br><br>
fibrin-bound    blood    clots     from    catheters,      especially     indwelling medical   devices.       There   is   a   further   need   for   the   prevention   and the   removal   of   fibrin  from   such  devices,    as   certain   bacteria   have binding  sites   that   favor  sticking  to  fibrin,   in particular. Summary of  the  Invention<br>
The present invention discloses solutions unique in their ability to meet the above needs, which are not based on anti-coagulation, anti-thrombotic, or chelating activities and do not involve the use of antibiotics, for which mammals can develop resistance. The present invention solves the needs set forth herein by using a plasminogen activator in conjunction with a disinfectant used as a preservative, mainly an organic alcohol that serves in this capacity. The resulting composition not only has fibrinolytic activity, but also prevents pathogen growth, especially  in  clotted catheters,   and has passed USP  standards.<br>
The invention is as claimed. Specifically, in one aspect the present invention provides a composition useful for removal of fibrin-bound blood clots from a catheter comprising water, a fibrinolytically effective amount of a plasminogen activator, and a preservatively effective amount of a bacteriostatic organic alcohol, wherein the composition does not comprise a chelating agent.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a multi-compartment package comprising a compartment comprising a f ibrinolytically effective amount of a plasminogen activator, a compartment comprising water containing a preservatively effective amount of a bacteriostatic organic alcohol, wherein neither compartment comprises a chelating agent, and instructions for mixing the content's of both compartments and for using the resulting mixture to remove fibrin-bound blood clots from a catheter that contains such blood clots.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a multi-compartment package comprising a compartment comprising from about 0.1 to 10 mg/mL of native-sequence t~PA or tenecteplase and a compartment comprising water containing about 0.5 to 1.2% (v/v) of benzyl alcohol, isopropanol, or ethanol, wherein neither compartment     comprises    a     chelating    agent,      and     instructions     for<br>
8<br><br>
mixing the contents of both compartments and for using the resulting mixture to remove fibrin-bound blood clots from a catheter that contains such blood clots.<br>
The preferred amount of benzyl alcohol, a preferred alcohol herein, is about 0.8 - 1.1%. This range and the broader range of about 0.5 to 1.2% are enough to inhibit microbe growth but preserve stability and function of the plasminogen activator. An advantage of these alcohols is that tttiey do not lead to antibiotic resistance.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the invention provides a method for removing fibrin-bound blood clots from a catheter that contains such blood clots comprising contacting the catheter with the above composition for at least about 5 days.<br>
In  a yet  further  embodiment,  the  invention provides  a catheter coated with the above-identified composition. Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings         <br>

Preservatives   are   chemicals   used   to prevent    microbial    spoilage    of   preparations.         Disinfectants    are used   as   preservatives   to   prevent    the   overgrowth   of   bacteria    and fungi    in   pharmaceutical   preparations.       They   must   be    effective   in preventing   growth   of   microorganisms    likely    to    contaminate    them, and    must     have     sufficient     solubility     and     stability     to     remain active,     as    per    Ellenhorn' s    Medical    Toxicology        2nd    Ed    (1997) , Section   IV.

10<br><br>
isopropanol, and benzyl alcohol, which are preferred herein, with benzyl alcohol being most preferred. Benzyl alcohol, which is hydrophobic, can disrupt cell walls and membranes of microorganisms, denature proteins, and inactivate enzymes.<br>
"Bacteriostatic water for injection" or "BWFI" refers to a mixture of water and varying amounts of benzyl alcohol and water with no other ingredients as defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).<br>
As used herein, "sterile water for injection" or "SWFI" is sterile water alone without any other ingredient.<br>
As used herein, "normal saline" or "ISIS" is a mixture of water with an appropriate amount (such as 0.9% (w/v) ) of sodium chloride, with no other ingredients.<br>
As used herein, "bacteriostatic normal saline" . or "BNS" refers to sterile water with an appropriate amount (such as 0.9% (w/v)) of sodium chloride and with an appropriate amount (i.e., one that is preservatively effective) of a_bacteriostatic organic alcohol such as benzyl alcohol without any other ingredient.<br>
As used herein, the term "plasminogen activator" means a fibrinolytic single- or double-chain plasminogen activator, including urinary plasminogen activator in native or variant form, tissue plasminogen activator in a native form such as ACTIVASE® alteplase t-PA or in variant form such as r-PA (reteplase; RETAVASE®; Centocor, Inc. ) and tenecteplase (a t-PA variant designated T103N, N117Q, K296A, H297A,R298A/R299A available as TNKASE™ brand from Genentech, Inc. and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,029), as well as urokinase {e.g., ABBOKINASE®; Abbott) , which may be a naturally occurring native molecule or a variant of urokinase that has the function of a fibrinolytic in dissolving clots in the blood and preventing and removing fibrin. Preferably, the plasminogen activator is native-sequence t-PA, a fibrinolytic t-PA variant, native-sequence urokinase, or a fibrinolytic urokinase variant. More preferably, the plasminogen activator is native-sequence t-PA, a fibrinolytic t-PA variant, or native-sequence urokinase. Still more preferably, the plasminogen activator is native-sequence t-PA or a fibrinolytic t-PA variant. Still  more  preferably,  the  t-PA  variant  is  tenecteplase  or<br>
11<br><br>
reteplase.   Most preferably the plasminogen activator is native-sequence t-PA or tenecteplase.<br>
As used herein,  'chelating agent" means an agent used for chelating, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) , DMSA, deferoxamine, dimercaprol, zinc citrate, TRICITRASOL™ (a citrate calcium  chelator),  a  combination  of  bismuth  and  citrate, penicillamine,  succimer,  or etidronate.    Ethylene glycol-bis-{beta-aminoethyl  ether) -N,N,N' ,W -tetraacetic  acid  (EGTA)  and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and salts thereof are other known chelating agents, as well as edetate calcium disodium, triethylene  tetramine dihydrochloride,  and  those  that  chelate divalent metal cations such as Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe and Zn. Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a composition useful for removal of fibrin-bound blood clots from a catheter comprising water, a fibrinolytically effective amount of a plasminogen activator, and a preservative ly effective amount of a bacteriostatic organic alcohol. The composition does not contain a chelating agent.<br>
The water preferably contains the bacteriostatic organic<br>
alcohol to begin with. There are generally four types of diluents<br>
that are used to dilute or reconstitute drugs: BWFI, SWFI, BNS,<br>
and NS. The present invention includes only those that are<br>
bacteriostatic, i.e., BWFI and BNS. Preferably, the water<br>
containing the alcohol is bacteriostatic water for injection or is<br>
bacteriostatic normal saline.	.__<br>
The pH of the composition herein must be appropriate for biological use. Typically, the composition or solution of the present invention will have a pH in the range of from about 3 to 7, preferably from about 3.5 to 6.5 and, most preferably from about 4.5 to 6,5. The composition will normally be at a physiological pH. If necessary, the pH can be adjusted by additional acid or base, such as a mineral acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, or, preferably, one that will not cause acidosis, such as, for example, acetic, malic, or lactic acid. Other methods for adjusting the pH, familiar to those of skill in the art, can also be employed.<br>
12<br><br>
A test for whether the amount of plasminogen activator in the composition is f ibrinolytically effective can be done, for example, by in vitro clot lysis assays, such as those described in the Examples provided herein.<br>
The preservatively effective amount of alcohol can be determined, for example, by the anti-microbial effectiveness test set forth in the Examples below. Preferably the amount of plasminogen activator is from about 0.1 to 10 mg/mL and the preservatively effective amount of organic alcohol is preferably from about 0.5 to 1.2% (v/v) . More preferably, the fibrinolytically effective amount of plasminogen activator is from about 0.3 to 5 mg/mL, still more preferably from about 0.5 to 4 mg/mL, and most preferably from about 1 to 3 mg/mL. The more preferred amount of organic alcohol is from about 0.8 to 1.1% (v/v) .<br>
The composition of the invention is preferably exposed to conditions that substantially render any microorganisms therein non-viable and packaged in a sealed vessel, such as a syringe, a septum-closed vial, or an ampoule that is substantially resistant to the passage of microorganisms. Preferably, the sealed vessel contains an aliquot of the flush solution that is sufficient to perform one catheter flush procedure. For particular applications, a bulk vessel may be preferred that contains a sufficient amount of the solution to dispense multiple aliquots for individual catheter flush procedures.<br>
A method for flushing an intravenous catheter includes providing an admixed solution as set forth above and contacting the catheter with such solution for at least about two hours. The method includes filling a fluid-handling device, preferably a syringe, with an aliquot of the solution sufficient to perform a catheter flush procedure. The preferred amount for the flush procedure is generally about one to three milliliters. The practitioner then attaches the syringe to the target intravascular catheter that requires flushing and administers the solution into the catheter, thereby completing the flush procedure.<br>
The method herein may be used to remove preexisting blood clots at virtually any tunneled or untunneled catheter. As part of<br>
13<br><br>
a catheter maintenance or flushing regimen, the catheter most preferably is to be flushed with the composition herein, for example, once a week, once every 4 days, once every 2 days, once a day (about every 24 hours), twice a day, every four hours or as needed according to patient needs, as would be known to the skilled practitioner. The catheter-flushing- regimen may simply constitute once every time that the catheter is changed. In a preferred aspect of the method, the catheter is to be flushed more frecfuently at four-hour intervals with the compositions herein.<br>
Although the method of this invention applies to introducing the composition into catheters that are already in place, those skilled in the art will understand that contacting or coating the catheter outside the body with the composition can prevent the-deposition of fibrin on such surface after its implantation and reduce sites for bacterial growth. Thus, the surfaces of catheters, such as hemodialysis catheters, can be pretreated by the composition herein. The catheter can be treated with a composition initially and then, after insertion, subjected to repeated periodic flushing.<br>
Particular exemplary catheters  that may be prepared and coated with the compositions of the present invention are provided in  the above  list.   In the  coating method the plasminogen activator, water, and alcohol are present in amounts such that their  combination,  in  the  treated  article,  has  effective fibrinolytic and preservative activity.  In a specific embodiment, the catheter is a polyurethane or silicone catheter {or one made from similar polymers) that has been treated with (i.e., dipped or soaked in) a treatment solution as set forth above.  The surface of the catheter of interest is then exposed to the composition for a period of time sufficient to allow the formation of a film or coating of the composition on the exposed surface of the device. As a liquid,  the composition would be allowed to dry on the surface of the device so as to form a film.<br>
The amount of the composition herein injected into a catheter will be sufficient to fill it. Such devices, when they are hemodialysis catheters, typically have internal volumes in the range of from about 0.1 to 10 mL.   Such quantities will,  of<br>
14<br><br>
course, vary with the length and diameter of the tubing of the device, which, inter alia, can be a function of the size of the individual patient.<br>
If fibrin-bound blood clots are being removed from a catheter the catheter may be contacted with the solution herein for at least about 5 days, preferably about 6 to 15 days.      <br>
The present invention in still another aspect provides a kit or package.   In one embodiment, the kit or package comprises a container  means,  such  as  a  compartmentalized  syringe,  that comprises  at  least  two  separate  compartment  means.     One compartment  or  container  means  comprises  a  f ibrinolytically effective amount of a plasminogen activator such as t-PA, and the second container means or compartment comprises water containing a preservatively  effective  amount  of  a  bacteriostatic  organic alcohol.  As with the composition, neither compartment comprises a chelciting agent.   The package also contains  instructions  for mixing  the  contents  of  both  compartments  and  for  using  the resulting mixture  to  remove  fibrin-bound  blood  clots  from  a catheter that contains  such blood clots.   The  t-PA may be  a lyophilized powder that in dry powder form is then reconstituted when mixed with the water to provide a solution suitable for use. The kit may additionally include a container that is a carrier means adapted to receive the contents of the two compartments. The package herein may be a kit, wherein each compartment is a separate container such as a vial or ampoule, or the package may be a multi-compartment syringe.<br>
Various features and aspects of the present invention are ¦ illustrated further in the examples that follow. While these examples are presented to show one skilled in the art how to operate within the scope of the invention, they are not intended in any way to serve as a limitation upon the scope of the invention.

EXAMPLE 1 (Comparative)<br>
Summary<br>
Testing was performed as described below to evaluate the<br>
anti-microbial  properties  of  2  mg/mL  of  ACTIVASE®  t-PA  when    reconstituted in SWFI.  This sample did not meet the requirement<br>
of the USP anti-microbial effectiveness test.<br>
USP Anti-Microbial Effectiveness Test<br>
This test is used to evaluate the efficacy of a preservative<br>
in  a  formulation or  to  assess  the  intrinsic  anti-microbial    activity of an active ingredient.   It is described in USP 24,<br>
"Microbiological Tests/(51)  Antimicrobial  Effectiveness Testing,<br>
pages 1809-1811.<br>
A.	Materials and Major Equipment<br>
1.	The challenge organisms used were Escherichia coli, ATCC 8739,<br>
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 6538, Candida alhicans, ATCC 10231, and Aspergxllus niger, ATCC 16404.<br>
2.	Media, supplies, and major equipment were:<br>
Trypticase soy agar (TSA)          Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA)<br>
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), sterile, pH 7.2 + 0.2<br>
Sterile 50-mL conical tubes<br>
Sterile swabs and serological pipettes<br>
Spectrophotometer<br>
Colony counter, Quebec or equivalent<br>
Incubators at 2-8°C, 22.5 _+ 2.5°C, and 32.5 + 2.5°C<br>
B.	Procedure<br>
1.      Preparation of  inoculum:<br>
Each      organism      suspension     was      prepared      to      achieve      an<br>
8<br>
approximate concentration of 1 x 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Each of the five tubes containing 10 mL of sample was inoculated with 0.05 mL of its corresponding challenge organism, resulting in an initial concentration from between 1 x 10 CFU/mL and 1 x 10 CFU/mL of the test preparation. The initial population of viable organisms in each test preparation was calculated based on the concentration of the organisms in each of the standardized inocula by the Pour Plate Method.  This method is a common microbiological<br>
16<br><br>
technique to count the number of organisms in a test sample. The test sample is diluted with sterile saline and pipetted onto a sterile Petri dish. Then melted agar (the nutrient media) is poured into the Petri dish and mixed with the sample and incubated at a standardized temperature and time. This method yields colonies that form throughout the agar - not just on the surface.<br>
Approximately 10 mL of sample was poled into a tube left uninoculated to serve as a Negative Control. At T = day 7, day 14, and day 28, the population of each organism in the inoculated samples and in the Negative Control was determined by the Pour Plate Method, the validated plate count method. Incubation conditions for the Pour Plate Method are shown in Table 1. 2.  Validation of the Pour Plate Method:<br>
-1	-2<br>
The sample was serially diluted to obtain  10   and 10 dilutions.  A 1-mL portion of each sample dilution was added to each of 5 Petri plates.   For each sample dilution,  a 0.1-mL aliquot containing approximately 1 x 10  CFU/mL of each challenge organism was added to its corresponding Petri plate.  In parallel, the same inoculum volume of each organism was alicjuoted into each of two plates without the sample dilutions for count confirmation.<br>
A 15-20 mL portion of molten agar held at approximately 45°C was<br>
added to each plate and swirled gently to mix the contents.  The<br>
plates were allowed to solidify and incubated as indicated in<br>
Table 1.<br>
3 .      Preparation of   sample<br>
10  mL  of   sample was   delivered  into   each  of   five  vials.      Each<br>
vial   was   labeled  separately with   "EC",    "PA",    "SA",    "CA",   and   "AN",<br>
so   orie'.vial   was   labeled   for   each   organism   to   be   tested.      Ten  mL  of<br>
sample    was "delivered    into    one    vial     labeled    negative    control.<br>
Alternatively,   for   the   delivering   and   labeling   steps   above,    2 0   mL<br>
of   sample was  delivered  into each vial.<br>
4.      Bioburden determination<br>
Using   the   negative   control,    the   bioburden   of   the   sample   was<br>
determined   by   the   Pour   Plate   Method.        The   media    and   incubation<br>
conditions were used as   set   forth  in Table  1.<br>
17<br><br>
5.	Inoculation  of   sample<br>
0.05  mL  of   each of  the  organism suspensions  was   inoculated  at<br>
8<br>
1  x  10     CFU/mL   into   the  corresponding  sample  vial   containing   10   mL<br>
of sample. The volume of the suspension inoculum used was 0.5% of the volume of the sample. The mixture was vortexed thoroughly. The   final   concentration  of   the   test   preparation   was   approximately<br>
5.0 x 10 CFU/mL. Alternatively, if a 2 0-mL sample volume was used in each vial, for the inoculation step above 0.1 mL of each of   the  challenge   suspensions was  delivered.<br>
6.	Initial  concentration count  confirmation<br>
The  plate   count   of   each   standardized   inoculum  was   determined<br>
(1.0    x    108     CFU/mL)     by    the    Pour    Plate    Method.         The    media    and<br>
incubation conditions used are set forth in Table 1. The plate counts were performed in duplicate to obtain the average plate count of each standardized inoculum. The initial concentration of each challenge organism in the test preparation was calculated using  the   following  equation:<br><br>
where<br>
S = average organism concentration of standardized suspension (1.0<br>
x 108 CFU/mL)<br>
I = inoculum volume (0.05 mL)<br>
P = volume of test preparation (10 mL)<br>
7.  Sample storage and test intervals<br>
The inoculated containers and the negative control were incubated at 22.5 +_ 2 .5°C protected from light. Each container was sampled at specified time points in Table 2. The plate count of the inoculated samples and the negative control was performed by the Pour Plate Method. The plate count was performed in duplicate. Media and incubation conditions were used as set forth in Table 1.<br>

NA = not applicable R = required<br>
C.  Acceptance Criteria<br>
1.	For a valid challenge study, the concentration of challenge<br>
5 organisms in each test preparation was between 1 x 10  CFU/mL and<br>
1 x 10  CFU/mL.  There was no detectable bioburden in the sample used,in the validated plate count method.<br>
2.	For a valid plate count method, the average count of the<br>
recovered inocula at each dilution level must" be greater than or<br>
equal to 50% of the average count for the corresponding control.<br>
If the average count of the recovered inocula at a dilution.  If<br>
the average count is less than 50%, all counts at that dilution<br>
are considered invalid.<br>
D.  Interpretation l.USP<br>
For bacteria, there should be not less than a 1.0 log reduction from the initial calculated count at 7 days, not less than 3.0 log10 reduction from the initial count at 14 days, and no increase from the 14-day count at 28 days.<br>
19<br><br>
For yeast and mold/ there should be no increase from the initial calculated count at 7, 14, and 28 days.  "No increase" is<br>
defined as not more than 0.5 log10 unit higher than the previous<br>
value measured. 2. EP<br>
The criteria for evaluation of anti-microbial activity for parental preparations are in Table 3 in terms of the log reduction in the number of viable microorganisms against the value obtained for the inoculum.<br>
TABLE 3<br>
EP Criteria for Evaluation of Anti-microbial Activity<br>
for Parenterals<br><br>
NR == No recovery.<br>
NI = No increase. "No increase" is defined as not more than 0.3<br>
log10 unit higher than the previous value measured.<br>
*The A criteria expresses the recommended efficacy to be achieved. In justified cases where the A criteria cannot be attained, for example, for reasons of an increased risk of adverse reactions, the B criteria must be satisfied.<br>

EXAMPLE 6 Summary<br>
Alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA) was reconstituted to 1 mg/mL with EWFI,  BNS,  and  SWFI.    The  stability  of  the  protein  after reconstitution in glass vials was monitored at 37°C for 2 weeks. After 14 days of storage at 37°C, all the reconstituted solutions appeared as clear and colorless.  The protein concentrations {1.1 + 0.02 mg/mL) and pH (7.2 + 0.03) remained unchanged.  The percent monomer by native SEC showed a gradual decrease by 1-3% and 4-5% after one and two weeks at 37°C, respectively.   A decrease in percent single-chain and clot  lysis  activity  (in vitro)  was observed after one week at 37°C.   However, the percent single-chain and clot-lysis activity (in vitro) was drastically reduced after 14 days at 37°C.  More proteolytic clippings of the molecule were observed for the protein solution reconstituted with SWFI than with BWFI or BNS.   Therefore,  alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA) reconstituted with BWFI,  BNS, or SWFI to 1 mg/mL was relatively stable at 37°C for one week. Materials and Methods A.  Materials<br>
-Alteplase {2-mg vial rt-PA) -BWFI, USP, 20 mL (Abbott) -Bacteriostatic 09% sodium chloride (w/v) {BNS) injection,<br>
USP, 20 mL (Abbott) -SWFI, USP, 20 mL (Abbott)<br>
30<br><br>
B.  Methods<br>
Alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA) was reconstituted to 1 mg/inL with BWFI, BNS, or SWFI (in duplicate) . The reconstituted protein solutions were stored at 37°C. The stability of the reconstituted protein solutions after storage for 3 hours, 7 days, and 14 days at 37°C was assessed by the assays listed below.<br>
For particle counts by HIAC/ROYCO, a separate experiment was performed.   Alteplase (2-mg rt-PA) was reconstituted with BWFI, BNS, or SWFI (in duplicate) to 1 mg/mL.  Four vials per group for each time point were combined together in a single vial {original 5-mL glass vial) .   The particle counts  (3 x 1 mL sampling, discarding the first run) were taken at T - 0, 3 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after storage at 37°C. C.  Assays<br>
(1)	Color and Clarity.   Each sample in a glass vial was<br>
examined under  a  light  box  equipped with a black  and white<br>
background.   The color and clarity of the sample were recorded<br>
accordingly.<br>
(2)	HIAC/ROYCO.   Four vials of the reconstituted protein<br>
solution were combined for the measurement.   The procedure for<br>
particulate  matter  analysis  for  small-volume  parenterals  was<br>
employed with the modification that a sample volume of 1 mL was<br>
tested using a 1-mL syringe instead of a 5-mL volume using a 10-mL<br>
syringe.   Particle counts in the size range of &gt; 10 and &gt; 25  L<br>
were recorded.<br>
(3)	pH.  The pH of selected aliquots was determined using a<br>
RADIOMETER  PHM  93™ pH meter  equipped  with- a  combination  pH<br>
electrode (Microelectrodes, Inc.).  The pH meter was standardized<br>
with pH 4.01 and 7.00 standard buffers (Mallinckrodt, Inc.).  20<br>
 L of the aliquots were transferred to a 0.5-mL Eppendorf tube for<br>
measurement.<br>
(4)	Concentration by UV.   The protein concentration was<br>
determined by UV absorption at 280 nm.   A UV/VIS diode array<br>
spectrophotometer (HP8253A) was employed with a 1-cxn path-length<br>
quartz cuvette for measurement.   The samples were diluted 10 to<br>
12.5 fold with formulation buffer.   The measurement was blanked<br>
31<br><br>
against the proper reference and an UV scan from 240 to 400 run was taken-  The protein concentration was calculated as follows:<br>
Conc. ,  mg/mL =  (A280-A320) /1.9,  where 1.9 is the absorptivity (mL/mg-cm) of rt-PA at 280 run.<br>
(5) % Monomer by native SEC. A TSK 3 000SWXL™ (ToSoHaas, 300 x 7.5-mm i.d., 5- m) column was employed on a HP1090™ liqiiid chromatography column (LC) equipped with a Diode-Array detector. The mobile phase was 0.2M arginine, 0.12M ammonium sulfate, 10% isopropanol, pH 7.3. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. The samples (50  g of rt-PA equivalent) were injected in singlet and the chromatograms collected with detection at 280 ran. The percent monomer is calculated as follows:<br>
% monomer = (monomer peak area / total peak area attributed to protein) x 100<br>
(6)	%  Single  chain by reduced  SEC.    A TSK  3000SWXL™<br>
(ToSoHaas,  300 x 7.5-mm i.d.,  5-urn)  column was employed on a<br>
HP1090™ LC equipped with a Diode-Array detector.  The mobile phase<br>
was 0-2M sodium phosphate, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8.  The flow rate was 1<br>
mL/min.  The samples (12.5  g of rt-PA equivalent) were incubated<br>
with 20 mM DTT {final concentration) at 37°C for 3-5 minutes and<br>
injected in singlicate.   The chromatograms were monitored with<br>
detection at 214 ran.  The percent single chain (SC) is calculated<br>
as follows:<br>
% SC = (first main peak area / sum of the first and second main, peak area) x 100.<br>
(7)	Purified clot lysis activity for rt-PA.  The potency of<br>
the  protein  was  assessed  by  the purified clot  lysis  assay<br>
descr-ibed in Example 7 below.  Samples were diluted to assay range<br>
(200-1000 ng/mL) in two concentrations with diluent.   Dilutions<br>
were performed the day before the assay and diluted samples were stored at 2-8°C until analysis the next day.   rt-PA reference material was diluted similarly as an internal reference. Results<br>
The results of the study are shown in Tables 21 and 22 . After 14 days of storage at 37°C, all the reconstituted solutions appeared as clear and colorless. The protein concentrations (1.1 + 0. 02 mg/mL) and pH (7.2 + 0.03) remained unchanged.   Table 21<br>
32<br><br>
shows the particle counts by HIAC/ROYCO of the reconstituted alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA, n=l) at 1 mg/mL with BWFI, BNS, and SWFT after storage at 37°C. The table indicates an increase in particle counts (&gt; 10 and 25 urn) for all protein solutions after reconstitution compared to the diluent alone. However, all the results are well within the OSP limits for Small Volume Injection (SVI, see Table 23) . There appeared to be a decrease in particle counts for the reconstituted drug product stored over time at 37°C. The particle counts result also showed a lower number of counts for protein solutions reconstituted with BWFI and BNS than with SWFI.<br>
All the reconstituted solutions had 94-95% monomer remaining after 14 days at 37°C (Table 22) . Both the % single chain and clot lysis activity (in vitro) tests showed a decrease after one week at 37 °C. The % single chain is higher for the protein solutions reconstituted with BWFI or BNS than with SWFI. Without being limited to any one theory, this may be the result of the preservative inhibiting the proteolytic activity. After two weeks at 37°C, the per/cent single chain for the protein solutions reconstituted with SWFI dropped to equal to or less than 50%, which is below the stability specification (&gt;_ 55%) for the single chain in rt-PA.<br>
In addition to the conversion of one chain to two chains, the reduction SEC chromatograms of the reconstituted protein solutions after two weeks at 37°C revealed clippings/fragments of the molecule, suggesting increased proteolytic cleavage at elevated temperature with time (see Figure 1). Figure 1 clearly shows that in addition to the clippings or fragments, more conversion of one-chain to two-chain rt-PA was observed in the reconstituted rt-PA with SWFI than with BWFI or BNS after storage at 37°C for 14 days.<br>
The clot-lysis activity (in vitro) indicated that all' the reconstituted alteplase solutions (1 mg/mL) retained greater than or equal to 100% potency after three hours at 37°c (Table 23) . All samples were colorless or clear. The activity began to drop after one week of storage at 37°C, but about 90% of the activity (relative to initial, T=0) still remained.   There was a drastic<br>
33<br><br>
reduction in activity after two weeks at 37°C, with only 44-653 activity remaining.<br>

Conclusion<br>
Alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA) reconstituted with BWFI, BNS, or SWFI to 1 mg/mL was relatively stable at 37°C for one week in a glass vial. It is believed that the BNS solution would be antimicrobial, since it is the benzyl alcohol that is the active ingredient. Stability testing using BNS was positive, i.e., alteplase was stable and functional.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Summary<br>
T-PA diluted down to 0.01 mg/mL in normal saline was found to be lytically active in a clot lysis effectiveness test.  In such test,  thrombin and  fibrinogen  are mixed  together  to produce fibrin;  plasminogen and  rt-PA are mixed  together  to produce plasmin; and together the fibrin and plasmin lyse the clot.  The test measures the effectiveness of t-PA to act with plasminogen to form plasmin and thus lyse the clot. Materials and Methods A.  Materials:<br>
Alteplase (2 mg/vial rt-PA) was diluted to a concentration of 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/mL final protein concentration in 0.9% NaCl (Normal Saline, NS) -containing IV bags (Baxter and/or Abbott, 250 mL) .  Specifically, rt-PA, protein bulk, was diluted to 1 mg/mL (50- mg vial formulation equivalent, 0.004% TWEEN 80™<br>
36<br><br>
surfactant) with filtered MILLI-Q™ water, or a 100-mg vial rt-PA was reconstituted to 1 mg/mL (0.008-0.011% TWEEN 8 0™ surfactant) with Sterile Water for Injection, USP (SWFI) using a 60-cc BD syringe and an 18G needle directly inserted into the rubber septum of the vial at the center of the cake. The vial was gently mixed by slow inversions or rolling action until the cake was totally dissolved. IV diluent (0.9% NaCl, NS) was withdrawn and replaced with the same amount of the reconstituted or diluted 1 mg/mL rt-PA as follows:<br>
Final Cone. (mg/mL)   Vol. (mL) removed from a 250-mL IV bag*<br>
(Then replaced with same vol. of 1 mg/mL rt-PA)<br>
0.05	12.5 (30-cc BD syringe and 18G needle)<br>
0.024	6 (10-cc BD syringe and 22G needle)<br>
0.01	2.5 (3- or 5-cc BD syringe and 22G<br>
needle)<br>
o  Overfill of bag was not accounted for.<br>
After dilution into the IV bags (n=2 for each concentration), the bags were gently mixed by inversion (about 20-24 times). A 10-mL aliquot was withdrawn from the inlet port of the IV bag using a 10-cc BD syringe and 22G needle. An aliquot (t=0) was dispensed directly into a 20-cc Type I clear glass vial for visual inspection. Similarly, placebo equivalents at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/mL were also physically examined. B.  Assays:<br>
-1.  Visual Inspection<br>
Each aliquot was examined under a light box equipped with a black and white background.  The aliquots were compared to an equal volume of SWFI or filtered MILLI-Q™ water in a same-size glass vial that served as a control.  The color and clarity of the aliquots were recorded accordingly.<br>
2.  Puri£ied Clot Lysis Test (Microcentrifugal Analyzer (Test 1) and Plate Reader (Test 2)):<br>
The potency of the alt'eplase t-PA protein was assessed by the purified clot lysis assay described below.  Samples were diluted<br>
37<br><br>
to assay range (200-1000 ng/mL) in three or two concentrations with diluent. Dilutions were performed the day before the assay and diluted samples were stored at 2-8°C until analysis the next day. Rt-PA reference material was diluted similarly as an    internal reference.<br>
a.	Equipment:<br>
IL MONARCH Microcentrifugal Analyzer model no,  761™ was used, consisting of an analyzer assembly with fluorescence and light-scattering capability and built-in computer, and a loader    assesnbly.<br>

-Plasminogen kept frozen at or below -60°C until use.<br>
-Biocell fibrinogen prepared as follows: Fibrinogen and clot lysis buffer were brought to room temperature.  A total of 7 itiL of clot<br>
lysis buffer was added to the vial.   The vial was capped and parafilmed.  The vial was placed on its side in a dish or taped, to an orbital shaker.  The speed was set between 4 and 5.  The vial was shaken for up to one hour, while it was checked to see how well  the  cake was dissolving.    When the  cake was completely dissolved, the solution was transferred to a 50-mL Falcon tube. The vial was rinsed at least three times with clot lysis buffer, and the rinses were transferred into a Falcon tube to catch any residual globules or particles.   The solution was brought to a final volume of 3 0 mL using the markings on the tube.  The tube was parafilmed and put on the shaker for 15-3 0 minutes.   All protein was solubilized after shaking.   The solution was set on wet ice for at least 2-3 hours and gently shaken periodically. Using WHATMAN™ No. 1 paper, the solution was filtered by decanting the solution away from the precipitate.  The filtered solution was kept on ice.<br>

-Reference material  (standard ACTIVASER t-PA).  All solutions containing t-PA were kept in polystyrene or polypropylene containers.<br>
c.  Preparation of Standards:<br>
Starting with the reference material, a 10-ug/mL standard stock solution was prepared. The dilution was recorded on assay data sheets. The remaining standards were prepared according to the following dilution scheme. All standards were kept on ice and the expiration of the standard curve was 12 hours from the time of preparation.<br>
Standard	rt-PA Source	Assay Buffer<br>

The preparation of standard stock solution and of remaining standards was repeated to prepare two standard curves.<br>
d.  Preparation of Sample:<br>
i.  Initial preparation<br>
If the sample was a final vial of lyophilized material, it was  reconstituted  volumetrically  to  1  mg/mL  with water  for "injection (WFI) .   If the sample was a sterile bulk material, it was diluted to 1 mg/mL with WFI.<br>
ii.  Sample stock preparation<br>
Using a micropipet, 100 uL of the 1.0-mg/mL rt-PA sample was pipetted into a 15-mL polystyrene tube. A total of 9.90 mL of assay buffer was added to the tube using a 10-mL graduated polystyrene pipette or volumetric pipette plus micropipette. This solution was designated as the sample stock solution.<br>
iii.  Working sample preparation<br>
Using a micropipet, 600 uL of the sample stock solution was pipetted into a 15-mL polystyrene tube. 9.40 mL of assay buffer was added to the tube using a 10-mL graduated polystyrene pipette, or volumetric pipette plus micropipette.   This was the sample<br>
39<br><br>
solution to load into the sample cups.  The diluted samples were kept on ice.<br>
iv.     The  sample  stock  preparation  and  working  sample preparation steps were repeated to prepare two sample dilutions, v.  Positive assay control preparation<br>
The control was prepared by reconstituting a sample of rt-PA to 1 mg/mli, pipetting 0.5-mL aliquots into Eppendorf tubes, and freezing at -60°C. A new tube was thawed on each day the assay was run. The control was diluted using 100 uL of sample in the same manner as the sample. The diluted control samples were kept on ice.<br>
e. Procedure for MONARCH 2000™ Analyzer (Assay 1): The assay works as follows: Reagents are substances added to-a solution of another substance to participate in a chemical reaction. In this case, contents of boat 1 will react with contents of boat 2 to form a standardized clot. Thrombin (boat 2) , when mixed with plasminogen and fibrinogen (boat 1), causes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and forms a standardized in vitro clot consisting of plasminogen and fibrin. A test sample of t-PA is then exposed to the clot. T~PA causes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and plasmin then breaks apart the fibrin strands. As the clot breaks apart, there is a change in the absorbance (light) characteristics. The absorbance is plotted versus time.<br>
The pipette tips of the analyzer were checked to ensure they were properly aligned, and the water reservoir was checked to be sure that it was full. Syringes were debubbled if necessary and the wash cycle was performed.<br>
The analyzer parameters were as shown in Table 24.<br><br>
40<br>
Table 24 Analyzer Parameters<br><br><br>
*These items should be adjusted accordingly to ensure full data acquisition.<br>
Reagent boat 1 was prepared by adding 200 uL of reconstituted plasminogen to 10.0 mL of filtered fibrinogen.  This was mixed gently and. put into reagent boat 1.  The reagent boat 1 was placed into the first position of the analyzer reagent table.<br>
Reagent boat 2 was prepared by adding the 33 units/mL thrombin solution described above to reagent boat 2.  Reagent boat 2 was placed into position 2 in the analyzer.<br>
The 0.25-mL sample cups were placed in the sample ring. Using disposable transfer pipettes or a PIPETMAN™ pipette, the sample cups were filled with standard, control, and samples as indicated in Table 25, Suggested Loading Scheme.  If fewer than two samples were being run, the loading was done as indicated and the assay buffer or water was pipetted into any intervening empty sample cups.<br>
41<br>
Table 25 Suggested Loading Scheme<br><br><br><br>
The "Special request" button was pressed on the MONARCH™ Analyzer. The sample cup information was entered. The "Accept" button was pressed twice. After the MONARCH™ Analyzer finished pipetting, the reagent boats were removed and placed on ice. The sample ring was removed and placed in the refrigerator at 2-8°C.<br>
i.  Endpoint Determination:<br>
The endpoint (lysis time) may be determined by a computer program or manually. For automatic calculation by computer, the endpoint  is  the  time  required  to  lyse  the  clot,  which  is<br>
42<br><br>
determined automatically.   For manual endpoint determination, the endpoint is defined as the first time point below 0.03 absorbance units where the change is less than 0.003 abs unit.  Specifically, for manual determination,  the endpoint was determined from the absorbance time data. The first absorbance point less than 0.03 00 was located.  The endpoint was determined as the time of the first absorbance value less than 0.0300 if the change in absorbance between the current absorbance and the subsequent absorbance was less  than '0.0030.    If  the delta absorbance was  greater  than 0.003 0, one moved to the next absorbance reading and determined the delta absorbance.  The endpoint was the first absorbance value of the pair (initial and subsequent absorbance value) where the delta absorbance was less than 0.0030. ii.  Calculations:<br>
The mean lysis time for each standard curve point was calculated. The standard concentrations (ng/mL) and the mean endpoint times (which are in seconds) were converted to log values. A standard curve of log concentration (x-axis) versus log time (y-axis) was prepared.<br>
Using the slope and intercept values obtained from the linear regression analysis, the log concentration for each sample was calculated from the log lysis time (endpoint) . The antilog of the obtained log concentration was taken and multiplied by the dilution factor {e.g., 1667) to obtain units/mL.<br><br>
X  (sample dilution) X(l unit/mg).<br>
The system suitability of the standard curve was evaluated using the system suitability test. For a determination to be valid, under this test, the correlation coefficient for the standards must be between -0.997 and<br>
-1.000, and the control within + 10% of its accepted value. If system suitability was not met, the standard curve could be redefined by performing the linear regression analysis using no<br>
43<br><br>
fewer  than  four  contiguous points  (i.e.,  the  first  or  last standard may be omitted) .<br>
The results were reported as units/vial, units/mg, units/mL, IU/vial, IU/mg, or IU/mL, as required.  For the control, all five replicates were averaged.   System suitability was assessed as described above.  For final vial samples, all- five replicates per sample dilution were averaged.   The average result was reported from the two sample dilutions.  This was reported in units/vial, where units/vial - average units/mL x mL/vial.  For bulk samples, the  five replicates per sample dilution were averaged.   The average result was reported from the two sample dilutions.  The report was in units/mg where:<br><br>
*Units/mL or units/rag may be converted to international units (IU) /mL or IU/mg by multiplication by the appropriate international unit conversion factor.<br>
For COA and stability testing, the testing of the sample was repeated using one rotor per each of three days.  The average of the results from the three days was reported.  The assay may be repeated based on the results of the in-house control and/or based on determinate or indeterminate error.  The final results may be reported as an average of multiple tests.<br>
£.  Procedure for the Plate Reader Assay 2 :<br>
The plate reader was turned on and the temperature of the thermostat was set to 25°C. The lamp was allowed to warm up for at lerast half an hour. Thrombin was added in an amount of 20 uL to each wellT Thrombin may be added from a reagent reservoir or from, an interim plate using the multichannel pipette. 20 uL per well of diluted standards {in duplicate) was added to wells B2-B6 and C2-C6. 20 pL per well of the control was added to wells D2-G2, and 20 uL of the samples was added into the remaining wells in quadruplicate in a vertical format to a maximum of nine samples per plate. Wells in rows B-G not containing standards, controls, or samples should contain 20 uL of assay diluent.   The rt-PA<br>
44<br><br>
samples may be added individually with a single channel pipette or from an interim plate using the multichannel pipette.<br>
Suggested Plate Map<br><br>
The fibrinogen solution was allowed to reach room temperature<br>
prior to the addition of plasminogen. 200 uL per well of<br>
f ibrinogen-plasminogen was added to the plate as rapidly as<br>
possible across the plate.	~<br>
After the addition of fibrinogen-plasminogen, the plate was placed immediately into the plate reader and data collection was begun. The first reading was taken with two minutes of adding the fibrinogen-plasminogen to the plate, so that the maximal absorbance of the clot was recorded.<br>
The absorbance of the plate at 3 40 run was collected, and read at an appropriate time interval (usually 30 seconds) until baseline absorbance for all wells was achieved (usually one hour) .<br>
i.  Calculation:<br>
The endpoint determination (time to half-maximal lysis) was made as follows: Lysis times were calculated as the time for the absorbance to reach the half-maximal absorbance. The maximal absorbance corresponded to the maximal clot opacity recorded for that well. The background absorbance corresponded to the minimum absorbance of the totally lysed clot. The raw data points (lysis times in seconds) were averaged for each of the standard, control, and sample replicates, The log of the averaged value was calculated.<br>
45<br><br>
A standard curve was plotted by entering the data from lysis times {log seconds - y-axis) versus the rt-PA standard curve protein concentration (log ng/mL - x-axis) .<br>
Using the slope and intercept values obtained from the linear regression analysis, the log concentration was calculated for each sample from the log lysis time. The antilog of the obtained log concentration was taken and multiplied by the dilution factor (e.g., 1667) to obtain units/mL.<br><br>
X  (sample dilution) X (1 unit/mg).<br>
For final vial sampling, units were reported in units/vial, where:<br>
units/vial = average units/mL x mL/vial.<br>
If a specific activity was required for sterile bulk samples, the average of all five replicates in units/mg were reported, where:<br><br>
*Units/mL or units/mg may be converted to international units (IU) /mL or IU/mg by multiplication by the appropriate international unit conversion factor.<br>
-  System suitability was determined. For a determination to be valid, the correlation coefficient for the standards must be -between -0.995 and -1.000, and the control within +; 10% of its accepted value. If system suitability was not met, the standard curve could be redefined by running the -calculation program again using no fewer than four contiguous points (i.e., the first or last standard may be omitted) .<br>
The rt-PA activity was reported as units/vial, units/mg, units/mL, IU/vial, IU/mg, or lU/mL, as required on the assay data sheet. The assay may be repeated based on the results of the in-house control and/or based on determinate or indeterminate error. The final results may be reported as an average of multiple tests.<br>

Results<br>
By visual inspection the alteplase t-PA diluted to 0.01, 0.025, and 0.05 mg/mL with NS appeared as colorless, clear to slightly opalescent solutions initially and after 24 hours of infusion (with no filter) at room temperature. At 0.1 mg/mL in NS, alteplase t-PA appeared as a slightly cloudy solution immediately after dilution and remained as such throughout the infusion period.<br>
In the majority of cases, all fractions collected over 24 hours  for  all  concentrations  demonstrated specific activities greater than 90% as assessed by the clot-lysis activity assay. Conclusion<br>
Recovered t-PA (5 mg/mL) diluted to 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05% mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl IV bags {500 mL) was lytically active after 24 hours of storage at ambient conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Summary<br>
Tenecteplase diluted down to 0.01 mg/mL in normal saline was found to be lytically active in a clot lysis effectiveness test. In such  test,  thrombin and fibrinogen are mixed together  to produce fibrin; plasminogen and tenecteplase are mixed together to produce plasmin; and together the fibrin and plasmin lyse the clot.  The test measures the effectiveness of tenecteplase to act with plasminogen to form plasmin and thus lyse the clot. Materials and Methods A.  Materials and Chemicals<br>
*Teneteplase, TNKASE™, 50 mg vial<br>
*0.9% NaCl injection, USP, 500 mL (Baxter)<br>
*10 mL SWFI, USP (Abbott)<br>
*3-cc, 5-cc, and 10-cc BD syringes<br>
*22G 1.5 needles<br>
*5-cc WHEATON™ Type I clear glass vials<br>
*20-mm gray butyl rubber liquid stoppers<br>
B.  Methods<br>
Tenecteplase       (TNKASE™      variant      o£      t-PA) ,       obtained      from Genentech,    Inc.     (e.g. ,    U.S.    Pat.   No.    5, 612,029)        (50   mg/vial)    was<br>
47<br><br>
reconstituted to 5 mg/mL with 10 mL of SWFI, Using a 3 &amp; 5 cc syringe and 22G needle, 1, 2, and 5 mL of normal saline (NS) was removed from separate IV bags (500 mL NS, Baxter), in duplicates. The same volume was replaced with the reconstituted drug product i   to give a final  tenecteplase concentration inside the bags  of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 mg/mL.  The bags were then mixed gently by inversions-  A 10-mL aliquot of the diluted tenecteplase solution was sampled via the IV port with a 10-cc syringe and dispensed into two 5-cc clean clear glass vials  (6 mL in one and the    remaining in the other) .   The IV bags containing the diluted tenecteplase were placed on a bench top under normal fluorescent light at ambient conditions for 24 hours.  Additional aliguots (10 mL each) from these IV bags were sampled after 8 and 24 hours of storage. C.  Assays<br>
The pH determination was performed using a RADIOMETER PHM 93™ pH meter and a microelectrode (MI-410™, Microelectrode, Inc.) . The pH meter was standardized with pH 4.01 and 7.00 buffer standards prior to measurement at ambient conditions.<br>
All the aliquots of tenecteplase were subjected to the clot lysis assay described above to determine the in vitro bioactivity of tenecteplase in these aliguots. The samples were diluted to two or three different concentrations within assay range {200-500 ng/mL) with the diluent. Tenecteplase was used as an internal reference. All values obtained were normalized to the tenecteplase reference material. The bioactivity was assayed by clot lysis before and after centrifugation. Results<br>
A summary of the results is shown in Table 26. The observed pH (7.1-7.2) for the higher tenecteplase concentration (0.05 mg/mL in NS)' was slightly higher than that for the lower concentrations (pH 6.7-6.8 and pH 6.8-6.9 at 0.01 and 0.02 mg/mL, respectively). This is due to the larger amount of the buffered tenecteplase (5 mg/mL, pH 7.3) being added to the IV bag directly for initial dilution. But all the pH values remained unchanged after 24 hours of storage at ambient conditions.<br>
48<br><br>
The   clot   lysis   activity  and  protein   concentrations (determined  by  RP-HPLC)   were  performed  before  and  after centrifugation of each sample aliquot.  This was to ensure that any precipitation that was not visible to the naked eye was removed prior to assay for more accurate interpretation of the results.   In all cases,  the results after centrifugation were slightly lower for both activity and concentration than before centrifugation,  suggesting  a  small  amount  of  precipitation occurred.   Table 26 shows the percent change in concentration before and after centrifugation,  which indicates  the loss of protein is higher at 0.01 and 0.02 mg/mL initially soon after dilution than at higher concentration (0.5 mg/mL) .  This percent change at lower concentration (0.01 mg/mL)  also increased with-time  of  storage.    At  0.01  mg/mL,  the  percent  change  in concentration was 57% immediately after dilution and increased to 71% after 24 hours.   No significant change was observed at 0.02 and 0.05 mg/mL.  This observation can be explained, without being limited to any one theory, by a more pronounced protein adsorption at  a  lower  concentration  that  usually  occurs  instantly  and saturates with time.<br>
Table 27 shows that the percent protein recovery relative to the targeted concentrations at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 mg/mL was 40-50%, 65%, and 86-92%, respectively. This percent recovery was under-estimated because the overfill volume inside the IV bag was not accounted for and the protein recovered would be at least 10% lower than the expected target concentrations (assuming 10% overfill in the IV bag).<br>
The clot lysis activity of the recovered protein (after centrifugation) did not change significantly upon 24 hours of storage at ambient conditions. The overall percent specific activity of the recovered protein at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 mg/mL was &gt; 100%, &gt; 92%, and &gt; 80%, respectively (Table 27).<br>
