				<td>BIODEGRADABLE COMPOSITIONS BASED ON NANOPARTICULATE STARCH<br>
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates lo biodegradable multiphase compositions based on starch, capable of being transformed into flexible films with longitudinal tensile properties in traction at 23°C, 50% RH that give rise to a K. factor greater than 28, preferably greater lhan 30 and even more preferably greater than 33, defined as follows; K = (Breaking load) x (Young's Modulus) x (Breaking energy) / 1,000.000 with Breaking load and Young's modulus expressed in MPa and Breaking energy in KJ/m . These films have no phenomena of transverse tearing even at relative humidity of less than 20% and at 23°C and are particularly suitable for producing very tough bags and wrappings. These properties are even more noteworthy as they refer to films obtained without post-film stretching.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are water insoluble and not water dispersible according to the standard UNI 10956 or EN 149K7.<br>
In   particular,   the   present   invention   relates   to   multiphase   biodegradable   compositions comprising at least two phases:<br>
(a)	a continuous phase composed of a matrix of al least one tough hydrophobic polymer incompatible with starch, said polymer being selected from the class of polyesters from diacid-diol;<br>
(b)	a homogeneously dispersed nanoparticulate starch phase with mean dimensions of less than 0.25 jun, preferably less than 0.20 urn, and even more preferably less than 0.18 |im;<br>
wherein the K factor is greater than 28, preferably greater than 30 and even more<br>
preferably greater than 33. The dimensions of starch particles arc measured in the transverse section with respect to the direction of the extrusion flow or, anyhow, with respect to the direction of material's output. The dimension of a starch particle is therefore measured on the bidimensional shape resulting from the transverse section.<br>
The mean dimension of the starch particles is calculated as the numeral (or arithmetic) average of the particles dimensions.<br>
In case of a spherical particle the dimension of the particle corresponds to the diameter of a circle.<br>
 <br>
In case of a non-spherical particle the dimension (d) of the particle is calculated according to<br>
the following formula:	J_  i &gt;    i<br>
where di is the minor diameter and d: is the majordiamctcroftheellip.se in which the particle can be inscribed or approximated.<br>
Preferably, the compositions according to the preseni invention have a distribution of the starch panicles such an:<br>
-	dimension of 80% of the starch particles is less than 0,35 urn;<br>
-	the area of such 80% starch particles is greater than 45% with respect to the total area of the starch particles.<br>
Particularly preferred according to the present invention arc compositions witli a distribution of the starch particles such as:<br>
-	dimension of 80% of the starch particles is less than 0.25 um;<br>
-	the area of such K0% starch particles is greater than 50% with respect to the total area of the starch particles.<br>
One drawback of the starch-based biodegradable bags currently present on the market is represented by the lack of uniformity of the mechanical properties, in particular tear strength, in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Shopping bags measuring 60 x 60 cm used by large-scale retailers are prevalently made of PE with thicknesses of around 18-20 (.im, while at these thicknesses, starch-based biodegradable films arc still too yielding or too fragile to withstand certain limits of weight (i.e. 10 kg). These limits in performance arc particularly apparent in conditions of low humidity.<br>
The aforesaid technical problem has now been solved with the biodegradable compositions based on starch, according to the present invention which, having a high load, a modulus superior to that of a normal LDPE and extremely high tenacity in the two directions, without any transverse displacement, are particularly advantageous for producing thin films. In fact, the present biodegradable compositions allow bags with thicknesses in the order of 18-20 urn and even with thicknesses lower than 18 um if needed from a practical application, to be produced, in other words, with thicknesses comparable to bags made of the medium density polyethylene. It is also possible to produce "loop-handle" bags with dimensions of approximately 70 x 70 cm and thicknesses in the order of 50 um, the same thickness as LDPE loop-handle bags. The present compositions arc biodegradable according to the standard EN 13432.<br>
 <br>
In particular, the materials according to the present invention comprise;<br>
(a)	with regard to the hydrophobic matrix, at least one tough thermoplastic polymer incompatible with the starch and in the continuous phase between 55 and 95%. preferably between 58 and 90%. more preferably between 60 and 85%, and even more preferably between 62 and 80%;<br>
(b)	with regard to the dispersed starch phase, al least one desimcturized nanoparticulate starch in a percentage between 5 and 45%, preferably between 10 and 42%, more preferably between 15 and 40% and even more preferably between 20 and 38%.<br>
To obtain a material with breaking load, and tenacity in the two transverse and longitudinal<br>
directions, superior to the materials described in prior art it is necessary to u.se specific weight<br>
ratios of the various components, and to use a process in the extruder or any other machine<br>
capable of providing temperature and shear conditions that allow reduction of the dispersed<br>
phases in very small particles.<br>
In general, the most suitable extrusion systems are those that use laminating screws with a<br>
ratio between the maximum and minimum diameter of the screw of less than J.6 and more<br>
preferably less than 1.4.<br>
With regard to the hydrophobic matrix, tough polyesters from diacid-diol are taken into<br>
consideration herein, i.e. polyesters characterized by Modulus of less than 200 MPa and<br>
ultimate elongation greater than 500%, such as the aliphatic aromatic polyesters from<br>
diacid/diol of the type described in EP 559 785 (Eastman), EP 792 309 (BASF) and WO<br>
2006/097353 (Novamont). Within the limits indicated, aliphatic polyesters from diacid/diol of<br>
the type described in EP 1 117 738 are also taken into consideration here.<br>
Particularly preferred arc polyesters in which the diacid moiety is chosen from at least one of<br>
the following diacids: succinic, adipic, azelaic, sebacic, undecandioic, dodecandioic, brassylic<br>
acid or mixtures thereof.<br>
Even more preferred are polyesters from diacid-diol in which the diacid moiety, in addition to<br>
the diacids mentioned above, contains also aromatic diacids.<br>
Said aromatic acids are chosen from the group consisting of dicarboxylic compounds of the<br>
phtalic-acid type and their esters, preferably tcrephthalic acid. Said aromatic acids arc present<br>
in an amount 49 to 66 mo I %, preferably 49.5 to 63 mol%, still more preferably 50 to 61<br>
mol% with respect to the total amount of the acid components.<br>
During the polymer synthesis process various additives such as polycarbodiimides, poiyepoxy<br>
resins, peroxides and oxazolincs can also be added. Particularly poiyepoxy resins can be<br>
 <br>
advantageously added as additives in order to stabilize the final multiphase composition<br>
against hydrolysis. Particular!) preferred are resins of the glycidyl type. Still more preferred is<br>
BADGE (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether).<br>
With regard to the starch phase, al! native starches arc included here, such as those from<br>
potato, corn, tapioca, pea, rice, wheat and also high-amylose starch -- preferably containing<br>
more than 30% by weight of amylose - and waxy starches. Compositions containing<br>
destructurized starch are preferred.<br>
Starches such as corn and potato starch, capable of being easily destructurizable and which<br>
have high initial molecular weights, have proven to be particularly advantageous.<br>
The use of corn and potato starch is particularly preferred.<br>
For destructurized starch, the teachings contained in EP-0 1 18 240 and EP-0 327 505 arc<br>
referred to here, this being intended as starch processed so that il substantially has no<br>
"Maltese crosses" under the optical microscope in polarized light and no "ghosts" under the<br>
optical microscope in phase contrast.<br>
Furthermore, physically and chemically modified starch grades can be in part used, such as<br>
cthoxylated   starches,   oxypropylatcd   starches,   starch   acetates,   starch   butyratc,   starch<br>
propionates, with a substitution degree comprised within the range of from 0.1 to 2, cationic<br>
starches, oxidized starches, crosslinked starches, gelled starches.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention show good properties also in case of<br>
starch blends in which the starch is not strongly completed. With regard to the complexation<br>
of the starch, the teachings contained in EP-0 965 615 AI have to be intended as incorporated<br>
in the present description. The presence of the complexes of starch with one tough<br>
hydrophobic polymer incompatible with the starch can be demonstrated by the presence in the<br>
X-ray diffraction spectra of a peak in the range of the 13-14° on the 2 theta scale. According<br>
to the present invention,   with the wording compositions in which the starch is not strongly<br>
complexed   arc intended the compositions where the Hc/Ha ratio between the height of the<br>
peak (He) in the range of 13-14° of the complex and the height of the peak (Ha) of the<br>
amorphous starch which appears at about 20.5° is less than 0.15 and even less than 0.07.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can contain further dispersed phases composed,<br>
for example, of rigid polymers, in particular polyhydroxyalkanoates, such as polylactic acid<br>
and polyglycolic acid. Particularly preferred arc polymers or copolymers of polylactic acid<br>
containing at least 75% of L-lactic or D-lactic acid or combinations thereof, with molecular<br>
weight Mw greater than 70,000 and with a modulus greater than 1,500 MPa. These polymers<br>
 <br>
can also be plasticizcd.<br>
In the format ion phase of the multiphase structure of the present biodegradable compositions there must be at least one plaslicizcr for the starch to provide suitable theological properties to minimize the dimensions of the starch phase. This plasticizcr can simply be water (even the water contained in the native starch alone without the need for further additions), or self-boiling or polymer plasticizers. The quantity of plasticizer is generally chosen on the basis of rheological needs and of the mixing system.<br>
In any case, plasticizers can be added in a quantity of less than 10% in relation to. the components {A + B). Besides water, plasticizers that can be utilized in the compositions according to the invention are. for example, those described in WO 92/14782, with glycerol as the particularly preferred plasticizcr.<br>
Compositions containing water as the only plasticizer are preferred. Compositions containing the water present in native starch as the only plasticizcr are particularly preferred In the present biodegradable compositions various additives can also be incorporated, such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, heat and hydrolysis stabilizers, chain extenders, flame retardants, slow release agents, inorganic and organic fillers, such as natural fibres, antistatic agents, wetting agents, colorants, lubricants or compatibihzing agents among the various phases. Examples of hydrolysis stabilizers are polycarbodiimides and epoxy resins. Among polycarbodiimides particularly preferred are aliphatic polycarbodiimides. Among epoxy resins particularly preferred are epoxidized polymcthacrylates, in particular of the glycidyl type. The most preferred is a poly epoxy propyl mcthacrylatc. Example of chain extenders are peroxides. Among peroxides particularly preferred are organic peroxides.<br>
Thanks to the nanoparticuiate dispersed starch phase, the biodegradable multiphase compositions according to the invention are particularly suitable for being transformed into flexible films with high modulus and at the same time provided with isotropy in the two longitudinal and transverse directions, in particular in relation to tear strength. Said films arc particularly suitable for producing bags and wrappings capable of supporting heavy weights without severe deformations and without the occurrence of transverse fractures. The films obtained from (he biodegradable multiphase composition according to the invention can also be used to make sacks and bags for carrying goods, film and bags for food packaging, strctchable, heat-shrinkablc film, film for adhesive tape, for disposable nappy tapes and for decorative coloured tapes. Some other main applications arc for silage, for<br>
 <br>
breathable bags for fruit and vegetables, bags for bread and other food products, film for covering packs of meats, cheese and other food items and yoghurt pots. Due to their properties, the biodegradable multiphase compositions according to the invention can also find application in the field of textiles and non-woven fabric for clothing, co-extruded fibers and spun-bonded, hygiene and industrial products, and also for fishing nets or nets fruit and vegetables.<br>
