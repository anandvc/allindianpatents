Application Serial No. 10/082,986 filed February 26, 2002, .which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/340,190 filed December 14, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to bearing assembly for rotatably supporting a quill in the housing of rolling mill laying heads of the type employed in high speed rod mills to form the hot rolled exiting product into a helical formation of rings.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
A conventional laying head is schematically depicted at 10 in Figure 1. The laying head includes a housing 12 containing a hollow quill 14 rotatably supported between front and rear roller bearing assemblies 16 and 18. The quill 14 carries a bevel gear 20 meshing with a mating bevel gear 22, the latter being driven in a conventional manner by a gear box and motor (not shown).<br>
A laying pipe 24 is carried by the quill 14. The laying pipe has an entry end 24a aligned with the rotational axis X of the quill, and a curved intermediate section 24b leading to an exit end 24c spaced radially from the axis X.<br><br>
In a typical modern day high speed rolling operation, a finished rod with a 5.5mm diameter exits the mill a speeds on the order of 112-120 m/sec and at a temperature in the range of 750 to 1100 °C, The rod can either be delivered to the laying head at these elevated temperatures, or it can be water cooled down to about 600-950 °C before it enters the entry end 24a of the laying pipe. The curvature of the laying pipe, coupled with its rotation about axis X, forms the rod into a helical series of rings R. The rings are delivered to a cooling conveyor (not shown), on which they are distributed in an offset overlapping pattern for additional cooling prior to being gathered into,coils.<br>
When operating under these conditions, the laying head can attain rotational speeds on the order of 1500-2250 RPM and higher, and the rotating components of the laying head, including the roller bearing assemblies supporting the quill, can be exposed to temperatures a high as 100-110°C. The roller bearing assemblies must thus be designed with adequate clearances to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction.<br>
It has now been determined that, particularly in the front bearing assembly 16, which is relatively lightly loaded, at certain speeds such clearances can cause detrimental roller skidding and vibration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to eliminate or at least significantly reduce roller skidding and vibration caused by clearances in the front bearing assembly.<br><br>
To this end, the front bearing assembly is subdivided into first and second axially spaced roller bearing sets. A radial preloading force is applied to the first roller bearing set at a first location around the circumference thereof. The preloading force is opposed by a reactionary force acting on the second bearing set at a second location around its circumference disposed 180° from the first location.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a bearing assembly for rotatably supporting a quill (14) in the housing (12) of a rolling mill laying head, said bearing assembly comprising: first and second axially spaced roller bearing sets (16a, 16b) interposed between said quill and said housing; and force exerting means (40, 44) for applying a radial preloading force (Fi) to said first bearing set (16a) at a first location around the circumference thereof, said preloading force being opposed by a reactionary force (Fj) acting on said second bearing set (16b) at a second location around the circumference thereof disposed 180° from said first location.<br>
These and other objectives and features of the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a typical high speed rod laying head;<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged longitudinal sectional view of the front portion of a laying head with the laying pipe removed, and incorporating a preloaded front bearing assembly in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3-3 of Figure 2; and<br>
Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 2 of another laying head incorporating a preloaded front bearing assembly in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference to Figures 2 and 3, it will be seen that the housing 12 includes a front plate 12a and a top plate 12b. The front bearing assembly 16 of the present invention includes inboard and outboard roller bearing sets 16a, 16b axially separated by a center to center distance "d". Preferably, the distance d is between about 5 to 40% of the nominal diameter "D" of the bearing sets 16a, 16b.<br>
Each bearing set 16a, 16b includes roller elements 26 captured between circular inner and outer races 28, 30. The inner race 28 of bearing set 16b is seated on and fixed relative to the quill 14. The inner race 28 of bearing set 16a is seated on and fixed relative to an inner ring 32, which in turn is shrunk onto the quill.<br>
The outer races 30 of the bearing sets 16a, 16b are contained respectively, in cartridges 34, 36. The cartridges 34, 36 are received in axial alignment in a bore 13 in the front housing plate 12a. Cartridge 34 is held against cartridge 36 by shoulder bolts 38 acting through resilient so called "bellvilla" washers 39. A slight clearance is provided between the shanks of the bolts 38 and the holes in cartridge 34 through which they extend as well as between the cartridge 34 and the bore 13. These clearances are sufficient to accommodate slight vertical movement of cartridge 34 relative to cartridge 36.<br>
Cartridge 34 includes an integral lobe 34a underlying a top plate 12b of the housing. Lobe 34a is engaged by an adjustable bolt 40 threaded through a bushing 42 on the top plate 12b.<br>
By appropriately adjusting the bolt 40, a downward preloading force Fi is exerted on cartridge 34, and hence on bearing set 16a at a first location along its circumference. The<br><br>
interposition of a resilient bellville washer 44 between the bolt 40 and lobe 34a insures that the preloading force is resiliency applied. The preloading force may also be applied by equivalent alternative means, e.g., pressure cylinders, plastic or gas springs, etc.<br>
The preloading force Fi on bearing set 16a is opposed by a reactionary force Fa exerted by the front housing plate 12a and acting on bearing set 16b at a second location disposed 180° from the point of application of the preloading force. The preloading and reactionary forces Fi, Fi act in concert to eliminate clearances respectively in the upper half of bearing set 16a and the lower half of bearing set 16b. This in turn prevents or at least beneficially reduces both roller skidding and vibration attributable to normal operating clearances between the bearing components.<br>
Figure 4 discloses a second embodiment of the invention wherein the front bearing assembly 116 again includes inboard and outboard roller bearing sets 116ar 116b, each including roller elements 126 captured between inner and outer races 128, 130. The inner races 128 of both bearing sets are seated on and fixed relative to the quill 114. The outer race 130 of the inboard set 116a is contained within a cartridge 134 fixed in a bore of the front housing plate 112a. The outer race 130 of the outboard set 116b is contained within a cartridge 136, which in turn is held by a retaining 135 hi a stepped bore 137 of cartridge 134.<br>
A slight clearance between cartridge 136 and the bore 137 in cartridge 134, coupled with a modest retaining force exerted by a retainer ring 135, serve in concert to accommodate some slight vertical movement of cartridge 136 relative to cartridge 134.<br>
A piston-cylinder unit 140 acts at a first location via an intermediate arcuate foot 142 to apply a preloading force F1 to cartridge 136 and hence to the outer race 130 of the outboard set 116b. This preloading force is again opposed by a reactionary force Fz exerted against the<br><br>
outer race 130 of the inboard set 116a at a location disposed 180° from the point of application of the preloading force. As with the first embodiment, the preloading force may alternatively be exerted by other equivalent means, e.g., that shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
It thus will be seen that in a broad sense, the present invention operates to preload one bearing set by applying a force to its outer race at one location, with the other bearing set being preloaded by a reactionary force acting on its outer race at a location disposed 180° from the point of application of the preloading force. The preloading force may be applied either to the outer race of the inboard set, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, or to the outer race of the outboard set, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
From the foregoing detailed description, it has been shown how the objectives and advantages of the invention may be obtained by several preferred embodiments. However, modifications and equivalents of the disclosed concepts such as readily occur to those skilled in the art axe intended to be included within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
