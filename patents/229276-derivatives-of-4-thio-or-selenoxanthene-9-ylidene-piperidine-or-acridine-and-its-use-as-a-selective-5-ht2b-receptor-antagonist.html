DERIVATIVES OF 4-(THI0- OR SELENOXANTHENE-9-YLIDENE)-PIPERIDINE OR ACRIDINE AND ITS USE AS A SELECTIVE 5-HT2B RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST<br>
The present invention relates to derivatives of. 4-(Thio- or Selenoxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine and acridine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which exhibit useful pharmacological properties,  including utility as selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists for treatment of a disease state which can be alleviated by treatment with a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.<br>
Serotonin,  a neurotransmitter with mixed and complex pharmacological characteristics, was first discovered in 1948, and subsequently has been the subject of substantial research. Serotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), acts both centrally and peripherally on discrete 5-HT receptors. Currently,  fourteen subtypes of serotonin receptor are recognized and delineated into sewen families, 5-HTlf to 5-HT7. Within the 5-HT2 family, 5-HTy,, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C subtypes are known to exist. These subtypes share sequence homology and display similarities in their specificity for a wide range of ligands. Nomenclature and classification of 5-HT receptors have been reviewed (see Martin and Humphrey, Neuropharm.  1994, 33, 261-273 and Hoyer et al.,  Pharm. Rev. 1994, 46,  157-203).<br>
The 5-HT2B receptor,  initially termed 5-HT2f, or serotonin receptor like-(SRL), was first characterized in rat isolated stomach fundus (see Clineschmidt et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.  1985, 235.  696-708; Cohen and Wittenauer,  J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1987,  10,  176-181) and initially cloned from rat (see Foguet et al.,  EMBO 1992,  11. 3481-3487) followed by the cloning of the human 5-HT28 receptor (see Schmuck et al., FEBS Lett.  1994, 342, 85-90; Kursar et al., Mol.  Pharmacol.  1994, 46, 227-234). The closely related 5-HT2C receptor, widely distributed in the human brain, was first characterized as a 5-HTlc subtype (see Pazos et v<br><br>
al., Eur. J. Pharmacol.  1984, 106, 539-546) and was subsequently recognized as belonging to the 5-HT2 receptor family (see Pritchett et al..  EMBO J.  1988. 7. 4135-4.140).<br>
Because of the similarities in the pharmacology of ligand interactions at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C' receptors, many of the therapeutic targets that have been proposed for 5-HT2c receptor antagonists are also targets for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. Current evidence strongly supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonists in treating anxiety (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder),  alcoholism and addiction to other drugs of abuse, depression, migraine, sleep disorders, feeding disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa) and-priapism. Additionally, current evidence strongly supports a therapeutic role for selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists that will offer distinct therapeutic advantages collectively in efficacy,  rapidity of onset and absence of side effects. Such agents are expected to be useful in the treatment of hypertension, disorders of the gastrointestinal track (e.g..  irritable bowel syndrome,  hypertonic lower esophageal sphinter, motility disorders), restenosis,  asthma and obstructive airway disease, and prostatic hyperplasia (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia).<br>
US-A-3,275,640 describes generically substituted 1-hydrocarbyl-4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidines and their preparation.  It is also disclosed that the compounds may be used as therapeutic agents because of their antihistamine and/or antiserotonin properties.<br>
US-A-3,557,287 relates to a combination preparation for use in the<br>
threatment of headaches of vascular origin containing as active<br>
constituents (a) a vasotonic lysergic acid selected from ergostine,<br>
ergotamine, dihydroergostine, dihydroergotamine, ergovaline, 5'-<br>
methylergoalanine;  (b) caffeine; and (c) 9-(l-methy1-4-	'<br><br>
perperidy!idene)thioxanthene (= l-methyl-4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine.<br>
DE-A-22 56 392 discloses 4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine derivatives wherein the nitrogen atom of the piperidine ring is bonded -to an alkyl radical substituted   with cyano,  -COR or -C00R. Sleep-inducing properties are attributed to these derivatives.<br>
JP-A-61106573 refers to the use of substituted 4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidines as pesticides.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a compound acting as selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.<br>
The object is met by a compound according to formula<br><br>
wherein Rl is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl (straight or branched), hexyl  (straight or branched), methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy,  isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, phenoxy, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, amino, dimethyl amino,  fluorine,  chlorine, bromine,  -C0N(CH3)2 or -C0N(C2H5)2, R2 is methyl, ethyl,  propyl,  isopropyl.  butyl, isobutyl,  pentyl, hexyl, hydroxy or hydrogen, or Rl and R2 are forming a heterocycle, R3 is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl. butyl  isobutyl,    '. pentyl.  hexyl. hydroxy or hydrogen, R4 is hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy,<br><br>
propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, trifluormethyl, amino, dimethylamino, diethyl ami no, fluorine, chlorine or bromine, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl. butyl or hydrogen, R5 is methyl or hydrogen, R6 is methyl or ethyl and X is S, N or Se, or a pharmaceutically i acceptable salt thereof, with the proviso that if Rl is ethoxy and X is S at least one of R2, R3, R4 and R5 is not hydrogen. .<br>
The residues Rl and R4 are of particular interest in the present invention. Rl is involved in mediating the selectivity of the compound for the 5-HT2B receptor. R4, however, is involved in mediating the affinity for the Hx  receptor. Preferably Rl is a lower alkyl or alkoxy group, or halogenated alkyl or alkoxy group, sterically promoting, but not hindering the receptor binding. R4 is preferably a polar group, particularly a small polar group, however, each group lowering the tix affinity is suitable for the according use. R2, R3 and R5 independently can be any residue, as long as the binding to the 5-HT2B receptor is not hindered.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the use of such a compound for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of a disease state which can be alleviated by treatment with a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.<br>
The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a compound or a pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers.<br>
Further the present invention is directed to the preparation of such compounds.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases and which<br><br>
are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric -acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, ascorbic acid and the like.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes:<br>
(i) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease.<br>
The term "disease state which can be alleviated by treatment with a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist" as used herein is intended to cover all disease states which are generally acknowledged in the art to be usefully treated with compounds having affinity for 5-HT2B receptors in general, and those disease states which have been found to be usefully treated by one of the compounds of the present invention. Such disease states include, but are not limited to, migraine, pain (e.g. acute, chronic, neuropathic, inflammatory and cancer pain) hypertension, disorders of the gastrointestinal track (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, hypertonic lower esophageal sphinter, motility disorders), restenosis, asthma and obstructive airway disease, prostatic hyperplasia (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia), and priapism.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the residues in the general formula shown above are as follows: Rl is an isopropyl, dimethyl ami no, methoxy or ethoxy group, R2 is methyl, ethyl or hydrogen,<br><br>
or Rl and R2 are forming a heterocycle, R3 is ethyl or hydrogen. R4 is methoxy, hydroxy, ethyl, methyl or hydrogen, R5 is methyl or hydrogen, R6 is methyl and X is S, N or Se, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the proviso that if Rl is ethoxy and X is S at least one of R2. R3, R4 and R5 is not hydrogen.<br>

In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the compound for the use as a medicament and for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition is selected of the group consisting of 4-(6-Isopropyl -l-methoxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl-piperidine, 4-(6-'<br><br>

Although US-A-3,275,640 describes the antihistamine and/or antiserotonin properties of the class of substituted 1-hydrocarbyl-4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidines in general it neither discloses the 4-(thio- or selenoxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine or acridine derivatives of the present invention nor correlates a selected derivative with a special antihistamine and/or antiserotonin property. The term "antiserotonin property" is indeed a very broad term and refers to 14 different receptor subtypes. Even more US-A-3.275,640 does not give any hint that a member of the class of substituted 1-hydrocarbyl-4-(9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidines has a selective affinity for one of the various 5-HT receptor subtypes, namely the human 5-HT2B receptor.<br><br>
The property of the novel 4-(thio- or selenoxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine or  acridine derivatives as a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist provides the possibility for a more specific treatment of the above-j cited disease states and reduction of undesired side effects at the same<br>
time.<br>
Gain of selectivity towards 5-HT2B receptors is accomplished via substitution at Rl. Therefore according to the present invention Rl<br>
)    shall be substituted by any of the residues cited above to serve as a pharmaceutical compound with selective affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor. Preferably substitution on Rl is a lower alky! or alkoxy group,  or halogenated alkyl or alkoxy group. Said groups appear to promote particularly the binding of the compound to the 5-HT2B receptor. The<br>
i    remaining affinity of the compounds to human Hx receptors can be lowered by substitutions at R4. The anti-histaminergic effects of non-R4 substituted 4-(thio- or selenoxanthene-9-ylidene)-piper.idine or acridine derivatives will  likely result in sedation. To reduce these undesired side effect it is preferred according to the present invention that R4<br>
i    comprises a substitution, which is preferably selected from small side groups, particularly preferred are small polar side groups. However, any side group lowering the affinity of the compound to the Hx receptor can be comprised.<br>
One general method for preparing substituted l-hydrocarbyl-4-(10-thioxanthylidene)-piperidines - not including the novel compounds of the present invention ■ is described in US-A-3,275,640.<br>
The methods used to synthesis the novel compounds is as follows: A "top" i    ketone 1 was reacted with a "bottom" Grignard reagent 2 to produce the coupled alcohol 3. The alcohol 3 was dehydrated with formic acid or ■ other acid to produce the desired alkene 4.<br><br>
Scheme I:<br><br>
One way to synthesize the educt 1, i.e. 3-ethoxythioxanthone, starts from 3-methoxythioxanthone 8a that may be prepared by a procedure described by I. Cervena, J, Metysova, E. Svatek, B. Kakac, J. Holubek, M. Hrubantova, and M. Protiva, in Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm. 41, 881-904 (1978) (Scheme II). 3-Methoxythiophenol 5 is reacted with 2-iodobenzoic acid 6 in a boiling solution of KOH in the presence of copper. After addition of hydrochloric acid the coupled acid 7 is obtained. The acid 7 is cyclized with polyphosphoric acid to produce a mixture of the isomeres 3-methoxythioxanthone 8a and 1-methoxythioxanthone 8b that can be separated by chromatography, preferably column chromatography. Other separation technologies may be used on an industrial scale to manufacture and separate the product, including, but not limited to by<br><br>
example Simulated Moving Bed Separations, Capillary Electrophoresis, High Troughput High Pressure Multi or Single Column Separation methods using chiral or non chiral support and separations media. Enzymatic dehydration in combination with any of the aforementioned technologies or enzyme enrichment separation methods used separately or in combination with any above can also be used.<br><br>
For variation of the side chain of the thioxanthene the separated 3-methoxythioxanthene 8a can be transferred for example to 3-hydroxy thioxanthene 9 by treatment with hydrobromic acid and acetic acid. The 3-hydroxy thioxanthene 9 can then be reacted with iodoethane in the presence of a base, preferably K2C03, to produce 3-ethoxythioxanthone 1 according to Scheme III:<br><br><br><br>
The other derivatives like 4-(6-Isopropyl-l-methoxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-1-methyl-piperidine, 4-(6-Isopropyl -l-hydroxy-thioxanthen-9-ylidenM-methyl-piperidine, 4-(6-Ethoxy-l-ethyl-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-1-methyl-piperidine, 4-(6-Ethoxy-l-methoxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-   -methyl-piperidine, 4-(6-Ethoxy-l-hydroxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl -piperidine, 4-(6-Dimethylamino-l-methoxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-niethyl-piperidine, 4-(6-Dimethylamino-l-hydroxy-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-1-methyl-piperidine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-selenoxanthen-9-yliden)-1 -methyl-piperidine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-l-methoxy-selenoxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl-piperidine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-1- hydroxy- selenoxanthen-9-yli den) -1 -methyl -pi peri dine, 3-Ethoxy-9-(l-methyl-piperidine-4-ylidene)-9,10-dihydro-acridine,  6-Ethoxy-l-methoxy-9-(l-methyl -piperidine-4-ylidene)-9,10-dihydro-acridine,  6-Ethoxy-l-hydroxy-9-(l-methyl-piperidine-4-ylidene)-9,10-dihydro-acridine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-5-ethyl-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl-piperidine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-4-methyl -thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl -piperidine, 4-(3-Ethoxy-4-ethyl-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl-piperidine and 4-(3-Ethoxy-thioxanthen-9-yli den)-1,3-dimethyl-pi peri dine, 4-(3,4-(Cyclopent-3'-oxy-r-eno)-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl -piperidine, 4-(3,4-(Cycl opent-4'-oxy-l'-eno)-thioxanthen-9-yli den)-1-methyl -piperidine and 4-(3,4-(Cyclopent-5&gt;-oxy-r-eno)-thioxanthen-9-yliden)-l-methyl-piperidine may be synthesized accordingly based on the method of Cervena,  I. et al as described in Collection CzechoSlov. Chem. Cumm. 41 (1978), 881-904 or by one of the methods of Watanabe, M. et al  as described in Chem. Pharm. Bull 32 (1984), 1264-1267, Chem. Pharm. Bull 34 (1986), 2810-2820 and Chem. Pharm. Bull 37 (1989), 36-41.<br><br>
The compounds of this invention are human 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. Affinity for the 5-HT2B receptors was demonstrated using an in vitro binding assay utilizing cloned human 5-HT2B receptors radiolabelled with [3H]-5HT, as shown in the examples. Selectivity for the human 5-HT2B receptor was shown by counter screening at human 5-HT^ and 5-HT2C receptors. Antagonist properties for HT2B were determined in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle. Affinity for the human tix receptor was determined using an in vitro binding assay utilizing cloned human Ha receptors radiolabelled with [3H]-mepyramine, as shown in the examples. Antagonist properties were determined by [3H]Inositol phosphate production in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating diseases which can be ameliorated by blockade of 5-HT2B  receptors. Because of the similarities in the pharmacology of ligand interactions at 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B receptors many of the therapeutic targets that have been proposed for 5-HT2C receptor antagonists are also targets for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. In particular, several clinical observations suggest a therapeutic role for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists in..the prevention of migraine, in that mobilization of 5-HT into the plasma is believed to be a precipitating factor in migraine. Additionally,  nonselective 5-HT2B receptor agonists provoke migraine attacks in susceptible individuals, and non-selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists are effective in preventing the onset of migraine (see Kalkman, Life Sciences 1994,  54, 641-644). It is speculated that activation of 5-HT2B receptors located on endothelial cells of meningeal blood vessels triggers migraine attacks through the formation of nitric oxide (see Schmuck et al..  Eur. J. Neurosci.  1996,  8,  959-967).<br>
Experimental evidence indicates that the compound of the present invention are useful in the treatment of pain,  including acute, chronic,<br><br>
neuropathic,  inflammatory, and cancer pain, particularly inflammatory pain. 5-HT (serotonin) plays a key role in the regulation of transmission of nociceptive information at various levels of the peripheral and central nervous systems.  (See Richardson, B. P., "Serotonin and Pain", Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.,  1990. 600, 511-520). Moreover, neuronal systems containing 5-HT are involved not only in the regulation of nociceptive input at the spinal and supraspinal level, but in mediating the nociceptive action of other analgesics including the opiates. 5-HT is a mediator of sensitization of nerve terminal nociceptors that may occur in the genesis of pain associated with inflammation. The 5-HT2B receptor is highly sensitive to activation by 5-HT and specific blockade by selective 5-HT2a antagonists may provide a novel avenue toward analgesia therapy.<br>
Experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists in treating hypertension.  In hypertension, one of the most profound increases in vascular responsiveness is observed for serotonin. Two lines of evidence imply that this results from a switch in the receptor mediating vasoconstriction from predominantly 5-HT^ to predominantly 5-HT2B. First, serotonin induced contractions of isolated blood vessels from hypertensive animals become resistant to block by selective 5-HT^ receptor antagonists, but remain sensitive to nonselective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. Second, there is an increase in 5-HT2B receptor mRNA in vessels from hypertensive animals (see Watts et a!., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996, 277,  1103-13 and Watts et al., Hypertension 1995, 26, 1056-1059). This hypertension-induced shift in the population of receptor subtype mediating constrictor responses to 5-HT suggests that selective block of vasoconstrictor 5-HT2B receptors may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of hypertension.<br>
Clinical and experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HTls receptor antagonists in treating disorders of the gastrointestinal<br><br>
tract, in particular irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the pathology underlying IBS remains unclear, there is a well-established implied role for the involvement of serotonin. Thus, meals with a high serotonin content can exacerbate symptoms in some patients (see Lessorf, Scand. J. Gastroenterology 1985, 109, 117-121), while in pre-clinical studies, serotonin has been shown directly to sensitize visceral sensory neurons resulting in an enhanced pain response similar to that observed in IBS (see Christian et al., J. Applied Physiol.  1989, 67, 584-591 and Sanger et al., Neurogastroenterology and Motility 1996, 8, 319-331). The possibility that 5-HT2B receptors play a crucial role in the sensitizing actions of serotonin are suggested by several lines of evidence. Firstly, 5-HT2B receptors are present in the human intestine (see Borman et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1995, 114, 1525-1527 and Borman et al.. Ann. of the New York Acad, of Sciences 1997. 812, 222-223). Secondly, activation of 5-HT2B receptors can result in the production of nitric oxide, an agent capable of sensitizing sensory nerve fibers (see Glusa et ah, Naunyn-Schmied. Arch. Pharmacol.  1993, 347,  471-477 and Glusa et al.,  Brit. J.  Pharmacol. 1996, 119, 330-334). Thirdly, poorly selective drugs which display high affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor are clinically effective in reducing the pain associated with IBS and related disorders (see Symon et al., Arch. Disease in Childhood 1995,  72, 48-50 and Tanum et al., Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996, 31, 318-325). Together these findings suggest that a selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist will attenuate both the gastrointestinal pain and abnormal motility associated with IBS.<br>
Clinical and experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists in treating restenosis. Angioplasty and bypass -grafting are associated with restenosis which limits the efficacy of these procedures. Platelet-rich thrombus formation is the predominant cause of acute occlusion whereas serotonin,  among other platelet-derived mediators, is thought to contribute to late restenosis (see Barradas et<br><br>
al., Clinica Chim. Acta 1994, 230, 157-167). This late restenosis involves proliferation of the vascular smooth muscle. Two lines of evidence implicate a role for 5-HT26 receptors in this process. Firstly, serotonin displays a potent mitogenic activity in cultured smooth muscle and endothelial cells via activation of 5-HT2 receptors (see Pakala et al., Circulation 1994, 90, 1919-1926). Secondly, this mitogenic activity appears to be mediated via activation of a tyrosine kinase second messenger pathway involving mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (see Lee et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1997, 272(1 pt 1), C223-230 and Kelleher et al., Am. J.  Physiol.  1995, 268(6 pt 1), L894-901). The recent demonstration that 5-HT2B receptors couple to MAPK (see Nebigil et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 2000, 97, 22591-2596),  coupled with the high affinity of serotonin for this receptor subtype,  indicates that a selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist may offer protection against restenosis of autografted blood vessels or of vessels following angioplasty.<br>
Clinical and experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT28 receptor antagonists in treating asthma and obstructive airway disease. Abnormal proliferation of airways smooth muscle, together with'hyperreactivity of the smooth muscle to constrictor stimuli including serotonin, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of human airway disease such as asthma and bronchial pulmonary dysplasia (see James et al.. Am.  Review of Respiratory Disease 1989,  139, 242-246 and Margraf et al., Am. Review of Respiratory Disease 1991,  143. 391-400). In addition to other subtypes of serotonin receptor, 5-HT2B receptors are present in bronchial smooth muscle (see Choi et al., Febs Letters 1996, 391, 45-51) and have been shown to stimulate smooth muscle mitogenesis in airways smooth muscle (see Lee et al., Am. J. Physiol.  1994, 266, L46-52). Since elevated concentrations of circulating free serotonin are closely associated with clinical severity and pulmonary function in symptomatic asthmatics, serotonin may play an important role in the pathophysiology<br><br>
of acute attacks (see Lechin et al., Ann. Allergy, Asthma, Immunol. 1996, 77, 245-253). These data suggest that an antagonist of 5-HT2B receptors in airways smooth muscle may therefore be useful in preventing airways constriction resulting from the elevated levels of circulating serotonin and prevent proliferation of the airways smooth muscle that. contributes to the long-term pathology of this disease.<br>
Experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists in treating prostatic hyperplasia. Obstruction of the urinary tract can occur as a result of prostatic hyperplasia and excessive prostatic constriction of the urethra. This in turn leads to diminished urinary flow rates and an increased urgency and frequency of urination. 5-HT2B receptors are present in the human prostrate (see Kursar et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 1994, 46, 227-234) and a receptor with the pharmacological attributes of this receptor subtype mediates contraction of the tissue (see Killam et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995, 273, 7-14). Some drugs effective in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia block 5-HT mediated contractions of the prostate (see Noble et al., Brit, J. Pharmacol. 1997, 120, 231-238). 5-HT2B receptors mediate smooth muscle and fibrotic hyperplasia (see Launay et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 3141-3147) and serotonin is mitogenic in the prostate (see Cockett et al., Urology 1993, 43, 512-519), therefore a selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist may have utility not only in mitigating the excessive prostatic constriction, but also in preventing progression of tissue hyperplasia.<br>
Experimental evidence supports a therapeutic role for 5-HT2C receptor antagonists in treating priapism (see Kennett, Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 1993, 2, 317-362). MCPP produces penile erections in rats, which effect is blocked by non-selective 5-HT2C/2A/2B receptor antagonists but not by selective 5-HT^ receptor antagonists (see Hoyer, Peripheral actions of 5-HT 1989, Fozard J.  (ed.), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 72-99)."<br><br>
This therapeutic target for 5-HT2C receptor antagonists is equally a target for 5-HT2B receptor antagonists.<br>
In applying the compounds of this invention to treatment of the above conditions, administration of the active compound and salts described herein can be via any of the accepted modes of administration, including oral, parenteral and otherwise systemic route of administration. Any pharmaceutically acceptable mode of administration can- be used, including solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages, or in sustained or controlled release dosage forms for the prolonged administration of the compound at a predetermined rate. The compositions will typically include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and at least one of the compounds of the present invention or the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
The amount of one of the derivatives of the present invention-administered will of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dose for oral, parenteral and otherwise systemic routes of administration is in the range of 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to 0.7-1400 mg per day, or preferably 7-700 mg/day.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically<br><br>
effective amount of one of the inventive pi peri dine compounds for a given disease.<br>
For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose, , cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like may be used. The active compound as defined above may be formulated as suppositories using, for example, polyalkylene glycols, e.g PEG (polyethyleneglycol) or PEG derivatives , acetylated triglycerides and the like, as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administrate compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as. for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monoiaurate, triethanol amine sodium acetate, sorbitvan monoiaurate, triethanol amine oleate, etc. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in an amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject being treated.<br>
Dosage forms or compositions containing one of the present piperidine compounds in the range of 0.25 to 95# by weight with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients. such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of<br><br>
mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose,  sucrose, magnesium, carbonate, and the like. Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. Such compositions may contain 1 to 95 X by weight of one of the compounds of the present invention, more preferably 2 to 50 % by weight, most preferably 5 to 8 X by weight.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneous! y, intramuscularly or intravenously.  Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection,  or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like. In addition,  if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, etc.<br>
Transdermal or "pulsed" transdermal administration may be supported by cremes, gels, dispersions and the like.<br>
A more recently devised approach for parenteral administration employs the implantation of a slow-release or sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained (see, e.g., US-A-3,710,795).<br>
The percentage of active compounds contained in such parental compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as wel*] as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject. However,<br><br>
percentages of one of the inventive piperidine compounds of 0.1 to 10 % by weight in solution are employable, and will be higher if the composition is a solid which will be subsequently diluted to the above percentages. Preferably the composition will comprise 0.2 to 2 X  by weight of one of the piperidine compounds in solution.<br>
In applying the compounds of the invention to treatment of diseases or disorders of the eye which are associated with an abnormally high intraocular pressure, administration may be achieved by any pharmaceutical1y acceptable mode of administration which provides adequate local concentrations to provide the desired response. These include direct administration to the eye via drops and controlled release inserts or implants, as well as systemic administration as previously described.<br>
Drops and solutions applied directly to the eye are  typically sterilized aqueous solutions containing 0.1 to 10 %  by weight, most preferably 0.5 to 1 % by weight of one of the novel piperidine compounds, along with suitable buffer, stabilizer, and preservative. The total concentration of solutes should be such that, if possible, the resulting solution is isotonic with the lacrimal fluid (though this is not absolutely necessary) and has an equivalent pH in the range of pH 6-8. Typical preservatives are phenyl mercuric acetate, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, and benzalkonium chloride. Typical buffer systems and salts are based on, for example, citrate, borate or phosphate; suitable stabilizers include glycerin and polysorbate 80. The aqueous solutions are formulated.simply by dissolving the solutes in a suitable quantity of water, adjusting the pH to about 6.8-8.0, making a final volume adjustment with additional water, and sterilizing the preparation using methods known to those in the art.<br><br>
The dosage level of the resulting composition will, of course, depend on the concentration of the drops, the condition of the subject and the individual magnitude of responses to treatment. However, a typical ocular composition could be administered at the rate of about 2-10 drops per day per eye of a 0.5 * by weight solution of one of the piperidine-compounds.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated for administration in any convenient way by analogy with other topical compositions adapted for use in mammals. These compositions may be presented for use in any conventional manner with the aid of any of a wide variety of pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles. For such topical administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic formulation can take the form of semisolid, liquid, or solid, such as, for example, gels, creams, lotions, solutions, suspensions, ointments, powders, or the like. As an example, the active component may be formulated into a syrup orgel using ethanol, propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, polyethylene glycols, diisopropyl adipate, glycerol, water, etc., with appropriate gelling agents, such as Carbomers, Klucels, etc. If desired, the formulation may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as preservatives, antioxidants, pH buffering agents, surface active agents, and the like. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical,Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition, 1995.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered in a single unit dosage form for continuous treatment or in a single unit dosage form ad libitum when relief of symptoms is specifically required.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
6-Ethoxy-l-methoxythioxanthone 1 is reacted with the Grignard reagent 2 prepared from 1-methyl-4-halopiperidine, preferably 1-methyl-4-chloropiperi dine, according to Scheme I. The alcohol 3 is isolated and dehydrated with an acid, preferably hydrochloric acid or formic acid.to produce 1-methyl -4-(3-ethoxy-9H-thioxanthene-9-ylidene)-piperidine (4).<br><br>

One way to synthesize the 6-ethoxy-l-methoxythioxanthone 1 is described by I. Cervena, J. Metysova, E. Svatek. B. Kakac, J. Holubek, M. Hrubantova, and M. Protiva, in Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm. 41, 881-904 (1978) (Scheme II). 3-Ethoxythiol 5 is reacted with 2-iodo-4-methoxybenzoic acid 6 in a boiling aqueous solution of KOH in the<br><br>
presence of copper. After addition of hydrochloric acid the coupled acid 7 is obtained. The acid 7 is cyclized with polyphosphoric acid to produce a mixture of the isomeres l-methoxy-6-ethoxythioxanthone 8a and l-methoxy-8-ethoxythioxanthone 8b that can be separated by chromatography, preferably column chromatography. Scheme II:<br><br>
A second procedure to produce the "top" ketone is based on the method of M. Watanabe et al.. Chem. Pharm Bull. 37, 36-41 (1989). Starting from 4-isopropylbenzoicacid 10, this is converted to the amide 11 which is treated with strong base to extract the proton adjacent to the amide group and, after the introduction of molecular sulfur and treatment with acid, the thiol group is introduced as in 12. Treatment of the bromoanisole 13 with strong base converts it to a benzyne that reacts with 12 to produce the desired ketone 14.<br><br><br>
Which procedure is suitable for the different compounds of the present invention depends particularly on the availability of the starting materials.<br>

All  reactions described in the following chapters must be performed under protecting atmosphere (dry argon or dry N2). Analysis are done with HPLC-MS-coupling (214 run, ESI positive mode. +30 V). Extraction steps of<br><br>
the thiols should be done with degassed or argon flushed solvents to prevent reoxidation to the disulfide.<br>

Receptor Binding Assay<br>
HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid pXMDl-hu2B encoding the human 5-HT2B receptor (see Schmuck et al., FEBS Lett., 1994, 342, 85-90) were used as described previously (Schmuck et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1996, 8/ 959-967). Two days after transfection cells were harvested, pelleted at 500g for 5 min at 4°C. gently resuspended in ice-cold bufferl (50 mM TRIS pH 7.7, 4 mM CaCl2) and homogenized using a Polytron PT 1200 tissue homogenizer (position 6 for 30 s). Cells were<br>
pelleted at 50,000g, 4°C for 10 min, washed with bufferl and pelleted again. The final pellet was resuspended in incubation buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.7, 4 mM CaCl2, 10 pM pargyline and 0.1 X by weight ascorbic acid). The binding assay consisted of 300 //I of membrane suspension (protein concentration = 0.3 to 0.5 mg/ml), 150 ^1 of competing drug and 50 jul of [3H]5-HT at a final concentration of 4 to 5 nM. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and the assay terminated by rapid filtration and two washing steps with 5 ml of cold 20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, and 154 mM NaCl over Whatman GFB filters. Filters were counted by liquid scintillation. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of 5-HT (100 \M).  Bound radioligand represented less than 1 X  of free radioligand. In competition experiments, specific binding represented about 60 X  of total binding. Results expressed as pK^ values are shown in Table 1<br>
Proceeding as in the example above the compounds of the present invention were found to have selective affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor.<br>

5-HT^ 5-HT2B 5-HT2C Receptor Binding Methods<br><br>
The following describes receptor binding methods in which ligands with high affinity for 5-HT2B receptors were counter screened at 5-HT^ and 5-HT2C receptors to demonstrate selectivity.<br>
5-HT^ receptors were labelled with [3H]ketanserin in human cortex, in .■ HEK293 cells expressing a cloned human 5-HT^ receptor and in HEK293 cells expressing the rat 5-HT2A receptor. For competition binding studies the ligand concentration was approximately 0.1 nM. For saturation binding studies concentrations of radioligand ranged from 0.01 nM to 2.0 nM. Assays were conducted in 0.5 ml of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 4 mM calcium chloride, 0.1 * by weight ascorbic acid) (pH 7.4 at 4°C). Non-specifc binding was defined with 10 mM unlabelled ketanserin. After a 60 min incubation at 32°C, membranes were harvested onto filters treated with 0.1 %  by weight of polyethylenimine and the bound radioactivity was determined.<br>
Human 5-HT2B receptors were labelled in HEK293 cells as described above, except that the radioligand was [3H]-5HT and that the assay buffer contained pargyline in a concentration of 10 mM and 0.1 %  by weight of ascorbic acid. For competition binding studies the radioligand concentration was approximately 0.4 nM while for saturation binding studies the concentration of [3H]*5HT ranged from 0.05 to 8 nM. Nonspecific binding was defined with 10 mM 5-HT. Incubations were for 120 min at 4°C.<br>
5-HT2C receptors were labelled in choroid plexus, Cos-7 cells expressing the human 5-HT2C receptor and in NIH-3T3 expressing the rat 5-HT^ receptor.<br>
Assays were conducted as described for the 5-HT^ receptor except that the radioligand was [3H]mesulergine. The radioligand concentration for competition studies was approximately 0.2 nM while for saturation<br><br>
binding studies the concentration ranged from 0,1 to 18 nM. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 juM unlabel led mesulergine.<br>
Competition radioligand binding data was analyzed using a four parameter logistic equation and iterative curve-fitting techniques to obtain estimates of the IC50 and Hill slope. Kd values, determined from saturation binding studies were then used to calculate inhibition dissociation constants (Ki).<br>

The following describes an in vitro functional assay characterizing 5-HT receptors (the putative 5-HT2B) in rat stomach fundus longitudinal muscle (Baxter et al.. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1994, 112, 323-331).<br>
Strips of longitudinal muscle were obtained from the stomach fundus of male Sprague Dawley rats. The mucosa was removed and the strips were suspended-with a resting tension of 1 g in oxygenated (95# 02 /S% C02) Tyrode solution at 37°C. The composition of the Tyrode solution was as follows (mM): NaCl 136.9; KC1 2.7; NaH2P04 0.4; MgCl2 1.0; glucose 5.6; NaHC03 11.9; CaCl2 1.8.<br>
Concentration-response curves to 5-HT receptor agonists were constructed under conditions where cyclooxygenase activities were inactivated by 3 Ijm indomethacin, monoamine oxidase activities inactivated by 0.1 mM pargyline, and uptake mechanisms inactivated by 30 IJH cocaine and 30 juM corticosterone.<br><br>
Effects of drugs were monitored by tension transducers and recorded on polygraph recorders. Tissue response was measured as changes in isometric tension (g). The mean potency (EC50) and maximum response were evaluated by standard iterative curve fitting procedures.<br>
Effects of antagonists were determined by measuring dextral  shifts to the agonist concentration-response curve after equilibration of the antagonists for at least 1 h. Concentration ratios were measured at half maximal response levels and single concentration antagonist affinities were determined by the equation:<br>
