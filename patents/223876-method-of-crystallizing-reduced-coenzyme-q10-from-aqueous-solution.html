				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF CRYSTALLIZING REDUCED COENZYME Q10<br>
FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of crystallizing<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10. Reduced coenzyme Q10 shows a higher level<br>
of oral absorbability as compared with oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
andis a compound useful as an ingredient ingoodfoods, functional<br>
nutritive foods, specific health foods, nutritional supplements,<br>
nutrients, drinks, feeds, animal drugs, cosmetics, medicines,<br>
remedies, preventive drugs, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known that reduced coenzyme Q10 can be prepared by<br>
producing coenzyme Q10 in the conventional manner, for example<br>
by synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from natural products,<br>
and concentrating a reduced coenzyme Q10-containing eluate<br>
fraction resulting from chromatography (JP-A-10-109933). On<br>
that occasion, as described in the above-cited publication, the<br>
chromatographic concentration may be carried out after reduction<br>
of oxidized coenzyme Q10 contained in the reduced coenzyme-Q10<br>
with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
dithionite (sodium hyposulfite), or reduced coenzyme Q10 may<br>
be prepared by reacting the reducing agent mentioned above with<br>
an existing highly pure grade of coenzyme Q10 (oxidized form) .<br>
However, the thus-obtained reduced coenzyme Q10 is not<br>
always easy to be crystallized preferably but tends to occur<br>
as a low-purity crystalline, semisolid, or oily product<br>
containing such impurities as oxidized coenzyme Q10. Moreover,<br>
even when crystallization could be achieved somehow, some<br>
troubles are occurred due to its poor slurry properties, etc.<br>
For example, poor slurry fluidity causes stirring trouble or<br>
difficulty in brushing away from a crystallization container,<br>
poor filterability, and the crystallization yield which is not<br>
always high.<br>
In addition, it is very uneconomical to use a large amount<br>
of organic solvents in crystallization. Moreover, these<br>
organic solvents are brought into products and tend to give<br>
unfavorable characteristics to the products which humans take<br>
in. In order to decrease the residual amount of the organic<br>
solvent in products to a level lower than the trace amount, too<br>
much time and expensive manufacture equipment are necessary for<br>
removal of the organic solvent, drying, etc.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the above, the present invention has its object<br>
for providing an excellent crystallization method for obtaining<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 crystal suitable for the<br>
industrial-scale production.<br>
As a result of intensive investigations, the present<br>
inventors found that the solubility and fluidity of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q1o may be preferably controlled by using water, and<br>
that the high-quality reduced coenzyme Q10 crystal may be obtained<br>
by crystallizing the reduced coenzyme Q10 in an aqueous solution<br>
for improving the slurry property, yield, etc., and thereby<br>
completed the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
crystallizing the reduced coenzyme Q10 which comprises a<br>
crystallization of the reduced coenzyme Q10 in an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q10 which can be used in the present<br>
invention canbe obtained in the conventional manner, for example<br>
by synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from naturalproducts .<br>
Preferably, it can be obtained by reducing oxidized coenzymes<br>
Q10 such as an existing high-purity coenzyme Q10, or a mixture<br>
of the oxidized coenzyme Q10 and the reduced coenzyme Q10 using<br>
a common reducing agent.<br>
Firstly, a method for reducing the oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
is explained. Since reduced coenzyme Q10 is readily oxidized<br>
by molecular oxygen to give oxidized coenzyme Q10 as a byproduct,<br>
a solvent high in protective effect against oxidation is<br>
preferably used as the solvent in the step of reduction.<br>
Preferably used as such solvent is at least one species selected<br>
from among hydrocarbons, fatty acidesters, ethers, andnitriles.<br>
Hydrocarbons are most preferred.<br>
The hydrocarbons are not particularly restricted, but<br>
there may be mentioned, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, etc.<br>
Preferred are aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
and more preferred are aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The aliphatic hydrocarbons are not particularly<br>
restricted, and may be cyclic or acyclic, or saturated or<br>
unsaturated. However, generally they contain 3 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, and preferably 5 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>

preferred are acetonitrile, propiononitrile, butyronitrile and<br>
isobutyronitrile, and most preferred is acetonitrile.<br>
In selecting the solvent to be used from among the solvents<br>
mentioned above, such properties as boiling point and viscosity<br>
are preferably taken into consideration; for example, the solvent<br>
should have a boiling point which allows appropriate warming<br>
for increasing the solubility and facilitates a solvent removal<br>
from wet masses by drying and solvent recovery from<br>
crystallization filtrates (about 30 to 150°C at 1 atm) , a melting<br>
i point such that solidification hardly occurs in handling at room<br>
temperature as well as upon cooling to room temperature or below<br>
(not higher than about 20°C, preferably not higher than about<br>
10°C, still more preferably not higher than about 0°C), and a<br>
low viscosity (not higher than about 10 cp at 20°C) . From the<br>
industrial operation viewpoint, a solvent which is scarcely<br>
volatile at ordinary temperature is preferred; for example, one<br>
having a boiling point of not lower than about 80°C is preferred,<br>
and one having a boiling point of not lower than about 90°C is<br>
more preferred.<br>
Among the solvents in the reduction reactionmentioned above,<br>
a solvent having low compatibility with water is particularly<br>
preferred. The solvent in the reduction reaction promotes<br>
purifying and obtaining a reduced coenzyme Q10 efficiently, by<br>
extracting the reducing agent to be described below and/or<br>
impurities from the reducing agent and removing the same. As<br>
such solvents having low compatibility with water, there may<br>
be mentioned, for example, the above-mentioned hydrocarbons and<br>
fatty acid esters among the solvents mentioned above.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Q10, when in a dissolved state, tends to<br>
become more resistant to oxidation as the concentration thereof<br>
increases. Reduced coenzyme Q10 is highly soluble in the solvents<br>
mentioned above and, in this respect, too, the above solvents<br>
are suitable for the protection from oxidation. The<br>
concentration of reduced coenzyme Q10 which is preferred from<br>
the viewpoint of protection thereof from oxidation may vary<br>
depending on the solvent species, among others, hence cannot<br>
be absolutely specif ied. Generally, however, the concentration<br>
of reduced coenzyme Q10 in the above solvents is generally not<br>
lower than 1 w/w%, preferably not lower than 2 w/w%. The upper<br>
limit is not particularly restricted but, from the practical<br>
operability viewpoint, it is 400 w/w% or below, preferably 200<br>
w/w% or below, more preferably 100 w/w% or below, still more<br>
preferably 50 w/w% or below.<br>
Thus, when such a solvent as mentioned above is used, it<br>
is possible to minimize the undesirable oxygen-involving side<br>
reaction via the step of reduction reaction.<br>
Additionally, the reduced coenzyme Q10 used for<br>
crystallization can be also obtained by reducing oily oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 in an aqueous solution. In this method, the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 can be synthesized without using an organic solvent,<br>
additional operations such as extraction to an organic phase,<br>
concentration, etc. are not required, the operation time can<br>
be shortened and subgeneration of the oxidized coenzyme Q10 can<br>
be minimized.<br>
The reduction reaction can be carried out, in the above<br>
solvent, using, as a reducing agent, a metal hydride compound,<br>
iron (metallic iron or iron in a salt form) , zinc (metallic zinc) ,<br>
dithionous acid or a salt thereof, or an ascorbic acid or<br>
a related compound, for instance.<br>
The metal hydride compound is not particularly restricted<br>
but includes, amongothers, sodiumborohydride, lithium aluminum<br>
hydride, etc. The amount to be used of the metal hydride compound<br>
may vary depending on the species thereof, hence cannot be<br>
absolutely specified. Generally, however, the reduction can<br>
be favorably carried out by using it in an amount of 1 to 3 times<br>
the theoretical hydrogen equivalent.<br>
The reduction using iron or zinc is generally carried out<br>
using an acid. The acid to be used is not particularly restricted<br>
but includes, among others, fatty acids such as acetic acid,<br>
sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, inorganic acids_<br>
such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, etc. Inorganic<br>
acids are preferred, and sulfuric acid is more preferred.<br>
The amount of iron to be used is not particularly restricted<br>
but, for example, an amount of about 1/5 by weight or larger<br>
based on the charged weight of oxidized coenzyme Q10 is appropriate<br>
for carrying out the reaction. The upper limit is not<br>
particularly restricted but, from the economical viewpoint, it<br>
is about twice the weight of the above charged weight or lower.<br>
Iron may be used not only in the form of metallic iron but also<br>
in the form of a salt, for example iron(II) sulfate, etc.<br>
The amount of zinc to be used is not particularly restricted<br>
but, for example, an amount of about 1/10 by weight or larger<br>
based on the charged weight of oxidized coenzyme Q10 is appropriate<br>
for carrying out the reaction. The upper limit is not<br>
particularly restricted but, from the economic viewpoint, it<br>
is about twice the weight of the above charged weight or lower.<br>
The dithionous acid or a salt thereof is not<br>
particularly restricted but a salt form of dithionous acid<br>
is generally used. The salt of dithionous acid is not<br>
particularly restricted but includes, as preferred species,<br>
alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, ammonium salt<br>
and the like. Alkali metal salts such as the lithium salt, sodium<br>
salt, and potassium salt are more preferred, and the sodium salt<br>
is most preferred. The amount to be used of the dithionous<br>
acid or salt is not particularly restricted but it is generally<br>
not smaller than about 1/5 by weight, preferably not smaller<br>
than about 2/5 by weight, and more preferably not smaller than<br>
about 3/5 by weight, based on the charged weight of oxidized<br>
coenzyme, Q10. Larger amounts may be used without causing any<br>
particularly trouble. From the economical viewpoint, however,<br>
the amount to be employed is not larger than about twice the<br>
weight of the above-mentioned charged weight, preferably not<br>
larger than the charged weight. Thus, the reaction can be more<br>
favorably carried out with employing ah amount within the range<br>
of about 2/5 by weight of the above-mentioned charge to a weight<br>
roughly equal to that of the charged weight.<br>
The ascorbic acid or a related compound are not<br>
particularly restricted, and include, for example, not only<br>
ascorbic acid, but also rhamno-ascorbic acid, arabo-ascorbic<br>
acid, gluco-ascorbic acid, fuco-ascorbic acid,<br>
glucohepto-ascorbic acid, xylo-ascorbic acid, galacto-ascorbic<br>
acid, gulo-ascorbic acid, allo-ascorbic acid, erythro-ascorbic<br>
acid, 6-desoxyascorbic acid, and the like ascorbic acid-related<br>
compounds, and may be ester forms or salts of these. Furthermore,<br>
these may be L-form, D-form or racemic form. More specifically,<br>
there may be mentioned, for example, L-ascorbic acid, L-ascorbyl<br>
palmitate, L-ascorbylstearate,D-arabo-ascorbicacid,etc. In<br>
producing the reduced coenzyme Q10, any of the above-mentioned<br>
ascorbic acidor related compounds may be suitably used. However,<br>
the water-soluble ones are suitably used in particular among<br>
the above-mentioned ascorbic acid or related compounds in view<br>
of separatability with the generated reduced coenzyme Q10, etc.<br>
And most preferred is a free form of L-ascorbic acid,<br>
D-arabo-ascorbic acid, and the like in view of the ready<br>
availability, price, etc.<br>
The amount to be used of the ascorbic acid or related<br>
compounds mentioned above is not particularly restricted but<br>
may be an amount effective in converting oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
to reduced coenzyme Q10. Generally it is not smaller than 1 mole,<br>
preferably not smaller than 1.2 moles, per mole of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10. The upper limit is not particularly restricted<br>
but, from the economical viewpoint, it is generally not higher<br>
than 10 moles, preferably not higher than 5 moles, and more<br>
preferably not higher than 3 moles, per mole of the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10.<br>
Among the reducing agent species mentioned above, zinc,<br>
dithionous acid or salts'thereof, and ascorbic acidor related<br>
compounds are preferred from the viewpoint of reducing ability,<br>
yield and/or quality, among others. In particular,<br>
dithionous acid or. salts thereof (specifically dithionous<br>
acidsalts) andascorbic acidor related compounds (particularly,<br>
free-form or salt thereof) are preferred from a viewpoint that<br>
they bring the reducing agent or impurities derived from the<br>
reducing agent into the reduced coenzyme Q10 crystal in only<br>
the trace amount or lower.<br>
In carrying out the reduction reaction, an alcohol and/or<br>
water are/is suitably used singly or in combination, as to be<br>
mentioned below. Water is preferred in particular when iron,<br>
zinc, or dithionous acid or a salt thereof is used as the<br>
reducing agent. When a metal hydride compound or an ascorbic<br>
acid or a related compound is used as the reducing agent, an<br>
alcohol can be used in combination. The combined use of water<br>
and an alcohol exhibits the characteristics of both water and<br>
the alcohol and contributes to improvements in reaction rate<br>
and yield, among others.<br>
In the following, a preferred method of reduction is<br>
described in detail.<br>
The reduction using dithionous acid or a salt thereof<br>
is preferably carried out using water in combination, namely<br>
in a mixed solvent system composed of at least one organic solvent<br>
selected from among the above-mentioned hydrocarbons, fatty acid<br>
esters, ethers, and nitriles, with water. On that occasion,<br>
the reaction is preferably carried out generally at a pH of not<br>
higher than 7, preferably at pH 3 to 7, more preferably at pH<br>
3 to 6, from the viewpoint of yield, etc. The pH can be adjusted<br>
using an acid (e.g. an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid<br>
or sulfuric acid) or a base (e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide such<br>
as sodium hydroxide).<br>
In the reduction using dithionous acid 1 or a salt thereof,<br>
the amount of water is not particularly restricted but may be<br>
an amount of water such that an appropriate amount of the reducing<br>
agent, namely dithionous acid or a salt thereof, can be<br>
dissolved therein. Thus, for example, it is advisable that the<br>
amount of the dithionous acid or a salt be adjusted generally<br>
to not more than 30 w/w%, and preferably not more than 20 w/w%,<br>
relative to the weight of water. From the productivity viewpoint,<br>
among others, it is advisable that the amount be adjusted<br>
generally to not less than 1 w/w%, preferably not less than 5<br>
w/w%, and more preferably not less than 10 w/w%.<br>
The reduction using the ascorbic acid or a related compound<br>
mentioned above can.be carried out using a solvent especially<br>
highly miscible with water as selected from among the<br>
above-mentioned hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, and<br>
nitriles, in particular ethers and nitriles, which are highly<br>
miscible with water, and more specifically tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, acetonitrile or the like. It is particularly preferred<br>
to use the alcohols and/or ketones to be mentioned below<br>
(preferably alcohols and/or ketones, which are highly miscible<br>
with water (in particular, monohydric or dihydric alcohols<br>
(preferably monohydric ones) having 1 to 5 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms, and/or, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or<br>
the like)). Namely, in the reduction using the ascorbic acid<br>
or a related compound, it is preferable to use alcohols and/or<br>
water-soluble organic solvents (the above ethers, nitriles,<br>
ketones and the like, which are highly miscible with water, for<br>
example).<br>
Furthermore, from the viewpoint of reactionpromotion (e.g.<br>
reaction temperature lowering or reaction time shortening) in<br>
the production of reduced coenzyme Q10, it is also possible to<br>
carry out the reduction using the ascorbic acid or a related<br>
compound in the presence of an additive having a reaction<br>
promoting effect, such as a basic substance or a hydrogensulf ite .<br>
The basic compound is not particularly restricted but may<br>
be either an inorganic compound or an organic compound. The<br>
inorganic compound is not particularly restricted but includes,<br>
among others, the hydroxides, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates<br>
of metals (preferably alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and<br>
the like), ammonia, etc. As typical examples thereof, there<br>
may be mentioned alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate, alkali metal<br>
hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, and<br>
alkaline earth metal carbonates such as magnesium carbonate.<br>
The organic compound is not particularly restrictedbut includes,<br>
among others, amines such as triethylamine, etc. Among the basic<br>
substances specifically mentioned above, weakly basic<br>
substances (weak bases or weak alkalis) such as the carbonates<br>
and hydrogencarbonates of metals (preferably alkali metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals, etc.), ammonia, and like inorganic<br>
compounds; amines such as triethylamine, and like organic<br>
compounds are preferably used. More preferred are the weakly<br>
basic inorganic compounds mentioned above.<br>
Preferred as the hydrogensulfite are, for example, alkali<br>
metal hydrogensulfites such as sodium hydrogensulfite, etc.<br>
The amount of the additive mentioned above is not<br>
particularly restricted but may be such that the reaction<br>
promoting effect of the additive can be produced to a desired<br>
extent (effective amount). From the economical viewpoint,<br>
however, the amount is generally not more than 20 moles,<br>
preferably not more than 10 moles, more preferably not more than<br>
5 moles, and still more preferably not more than 2 moles, per<br>
mole of the ascorbic acid or a related compound. The lower limit<br>
is not particularly restricted but, generally, it is not less<br>
than 0.01 moles, preferably not less than 0.05 moles, more<br>
preferably not less than 0.1 moles, and still more preferably<br>
not less than 0.2 moles, per mole of the ascorbic acid or a related<br>
compound.<br>
The reduction reaction is preferably carried out under<br>
forced flowing. The power required for stirring to cause such<br>
flowing per unit volume is generally not less than about 0.01<br>
kW/m3, preferably not less than about 0.1 kW/m3, and more<br>
preferably not less than about 0.3 kW/m3. The above forced<br>
flowing is generally causedby the turningof a stirringblade (s) .<br>
The use of a stirring blade (s) is not always necessary if the<br>
above flowing can be otherwise obtained. For example,a method<br>
based on liquid circulation may be utilized.<br>
The reduction temperature may vary depending on the<br>
reducing agent species and/or amount, hence cannot be absolutely<br>
specified. In the reduction using dithionous acid d or a salt<br>
thereof, for instance, the reduction is generally carried out<br>
at 100°C or below, preferably at 80°C or below, more preferably<br>
at 60°C or below. The lower limit is the solidification<br>
temperature of the system. Thus, the reduction can be favorably<br>
carried out generally at about 0 to 100°C, preferably at about<br>
0 to 80°C, more preferably at about 0 to 60°C. In the reduction<br>
using an ascorbic acid or a related compound, the reduction is<br>
carried out generally at 30°C or higher, preferably at 40°C or<br>
higher, more preferably at 50°C or higher. The upper limit is<br>
the boiling point of the system. Thus, the reduction can be<br>
favorably carried out generally at about 30 to 150°C, preferably<br>
about 40 to 120°C, more preferably at about 50 to 100°C. The<br>
reduction of the oily oxidized coenzyme Q10 is generally carried<br>
out at 45°Cormore, preferablyat 48°Cormore, andmorepreferably<br>
at 50°C or more, although it is dependent on the purity, etc.,<br>
then the oily reduced coenzyme Q10 can be obtained.<br>
The reaction concentration is not particularly restricted<br>
but the weight of oxidized coenzyme Q10 relative to the solvent<br>
weight is generally not less than about 1 w/w%, preferably not<br>
less than 3 w/w %, more preferably not less than 10 w/w%, and<br>
still more preferably not less than 15 w/w%. The upper limit<br>
is not particularly restricted but generally is not higher than<br>
about 60 w/w%, preferably not higher than 50 w/w%, more preferably<br>
not higher than 40 w/w%, and still more preferably not higher<br>
than 30 w/w%. Thus, the reaction can be favorably carried out<br>
at a reaction concentration of about 1 to 60 w/w%, preferably<br>
about 3 to 50 w/w%, and more preferably about 10 to 40 w/w%.<br>
The reduction reaction time may vary depending on the<br>
reducing agent species and/or the amount thereof, hence cannot<br>
be absolutely specified. Generally, however, the reaction can<br>
be driven to completion within 48 hours, preferably within 24<br>
hours, more preferably within 10 hours, and still more preferably<br>
within 5 hours.<br>
After the reduction reaction, an organic phase containing<br>
the product reduced coenzyme Q10 or the oily reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 is recovered (e.g. recovered by separation, extraction,<br>
concentration, etc.), and if necessary (preferably) , the organic<br>
phase is further washed repeatedly using water, brine, or the<br>
like to achieve contaminant elimination and, then, it can be<br>
subjected to crystallization as such or after dissolution to<br>
or substitution by other desirable solvents.<br>
As the other solvents, there may be mentioned, for example,<br>
hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, alcohols, fatty acids,<br>
ketones, nitrogen compounds (inclusive of nitriles and amides) ,<br>
sulfur compounds, etc. mentioned above or below.<br>
They were found that, the above-mentioned series of<br>
processes from the reduction reaction to the aftertreatment is<br>
particularly preferably carried out under a deoxygenated<br>
atmosphere, and, in the reduction reaction using dithionous<br>
acid or a salt thereof, in particular, such atmosphere greatly<br>
contributes to an improvement in reduction reaction yield and<br>
a reduction in reducing agent amount. The deoxygenated<br>
atmosphere can be attained by substitution with an inert gas,<br>
pressure reduction, boiling, or a combination of these. It is<br>
preferable to carry out at least the substitution with an inert<br>
gas, namely to use an inert gas atmosphere. As the inert gas,<br>
there may be mentioned, for example, nitrogen gas, helium gas,<br>
argon gas, hydrogen gas, and carbon dioxide gas. Nitrogen gas<br>
is preferred, however.<br>
The crystallization of reduced coenzyme Q10 of the<br>
invention is now described.<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q10 to be subj ected to crystallization<br>
can be obtained in the conventional manner, for example, by<br>
synthesis, fermentation, or extraction from a natural source.<br>
Preferred is the product obtained by reduction of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10. More preferred is a solution or oil, of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 obtained by carrying out the reduction reaction in<br>
accordance with the present invention, as described above.<br>
Still more preferred is the one obtained by reducing the oily<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 in an aqueous solution using dithionite ,<br>
or the one obtained by reducing the oxidized coenzyme Q10 using<br>
alcohols and/or water-soluble organic solvents.<br>
While the method of crystallization according to the<br>
invention can be applied also to products containing oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 in relatively large amounts, the method is<br>
particularly effective in crystallizing high-purity reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 prepared by the reduction method described above.<br>
In the present invention, the reduced coenzyme Q10 is<br>
crystallized in an aqueous solution. Use of water contributes<br>
to the economical efficiency obviously, and to the safety on<br>
industrial operation and product safety as well. Moreover, the<br>
use of water also contributes to improvement of the slurry<br>
property and the yield of the reduced coenzyme Q10, and can promote<br>
isolation of the reduced coenzyme Q10 efficiently by leaving<br>
a reducing agent used in the reduction reaction or impurities<br>
derived from the reducing agent in amother liquor. Furthermore,<br>
the above-mentioned use of water, or preferably the use of water<br>
containing salts can protect the reduced coenzyme Q10 from<br>
oxidization by molecular oxygen.<br>
The above salts are not particularly restricted but there<br>
may be mentioned, for example, salts constituted from alkaline<br>
metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium; alkaline earth<br>
metals such as magnesium and calcium with halogen atoms such<br>
as fluorine, chlorine and bromine; a residue obtained by removing<br>
a proton from inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid and organic<br>
acids such as formic acid, acetic acid andpropionic acid. Among<br>
these, preferred are inorganic salts, and more preferred are<br>
sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, etc.<br>
The concentration of the above salts is preferably high,<br>
and it is generally 3 w/w% or more, preferably 5 w/w% or more,<br>
more preferably 10 w/w% or more. Still more preferred is that<br>
the above salts are dissolved in water at saturation or close<br>
to saturation.<br>
As the method of crystallizing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
mentioned above, general crystallization methods such as<br>
crystallization by cooling, crystallization by concentration<br>
and crystallization by solvent substitution can be used. It<br>
is preferred to use the crystallization by cooling singly or<br>
in combination. As particularly preferable embodiments, the<br>
following two methods may be mentioned.<br>
(1) A crystallization method which comprises substituting an<br>
organic solvent solution containing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
(e.g. reaction solution, extraction solution, etc.) by water<br>
(for increasing the composition ratio of water).<br>
(2) A method of crystallizing the oily reduced coenzyme Q10 in<br>
an aqueous solution.<br>
In the above-mentioned two methods, it is more preferable to<br>
use the crystallization by cooling singly or in combination.<br>
Firstly, the method (1) is explained.<br>
The organic solvent containing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
is not particularly restricted but there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, alcohols,<br>
fatty acids, ketones, nitrogen compounds (inclusive of nitriles<br>
and amides), sulfur compounds, etc.<br>
As the hydrocarbons, fatty acidesters, ethers andnitriles,<br>
those exemplified as the reaction solvent in the fore-mentioned<br>
explanation about reduction of the oxidized coenzyme Q10 can be<br>
preferably used.<br>
The alcohols are not particularly restricted but may be<br>
cyclic or acyclic, or saturated or unsaturated. Saturated ones<br>
are preferred, however. Generally, they contain 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms. Still more preferred are monohydric alcohols<br>
containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, dihydric alcohols containing<br>
2 to 5 carbon atoms, and the trihydric alcohol containing 3 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
As the monohydric alcohol, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol,<br>
2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, 1-pentanol,<br>
2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, isopentylalcohol,<br>
tert-pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, neopentyl alcohol,<br>
1-hexanol, 2-methyl-l-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol,<br>
2-ethyl-l-butanol, 1-heptanol, 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol,<br>
1-octanol, 2-octanol, 2-ethyl-l-hexanol,1-nonanol, 1-decanol,<br>
1-undecanol, 1-dodecanol, allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, 1-methylcyclohexanol,<br>
2-methylcyclohexanol, 3-methylcyclohexanol,<br>
4-methylcyclohexanol, etc.<br>
Preferred are methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol,<br>
1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol,<br>
1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol,<br>
isopentyl alcohol, tert-pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol,<br>
neopentyl alcohol, 1-hexanol, 2-methyl-l-pentanol,<br>
4-methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethyl-l-butanol and cyclohexanol.<br>
More preferred are methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol,<br>
1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol,<br>
1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol,<br>
isopentyl alcohol, tert-pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol and<br>
neopentyl alcohol. Still more preferred are methanol, ethanol,<br>
1-propanol, 2-propanol,1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutylalcohol,<br>
2-methyl-l-butanol and isopentyl alcohol. Most preferred is<br>
ethanol.<br>
As the dihydr ic alcohol, there may be mentioned, for example,<br>
1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propandiol, 1,3-propandiol,<br>
1,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>
2,3-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, etc. Preferred are<br>
1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propandiol and 1,3-propandiol, and most<br>
preferred is 1,2-ethanediol.<br>
As the trihydric alcohol, glycerol, etc. may be preferably<br>
used, for example.<br>
As fatty acids, there maybe mentioned, for example, formic<br>
acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, etc. Preferred are formic<br>
acid and acetic acid, and most preferred is acetic acid.<br>
The ketones are not particularly restricted, and ones<br>
having 3 to 6 carbon atoms are preferably used in general. As<br>
specific examples, there may be mentioned, for example, acetone,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone,<br>
etc. Preferred are acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, and most<br>
preferred is acetone.<br>
As the nitrogen compounds other than nitriles, there may<br>
be mentioned, for example, nitromethane, triethylamine,<br>
pyridine, formamide, N-methylformamide, N, N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetoamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, etc.<br>
As the sulfur compounds, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, etc.<br>
In selecting the solvent to be used from among the solvents<br>
mentioned above, such properties as boiling point and viscosity<br>
(for example, the solvent should have a boiling point which allows<br>
appropriate warming for increasing the solubility and<br>
facilitates a solvent removal from wet masses by drying and<br>
solvent recovery from crystallization filtrates (about 30 to<br>
150°C at 1 atm) , a melting point such that solidification hardly<br>
occurs in handling at room temperature as well as upon cooling<br>
to room temperature or below (not higher than about 20°C,<br>
preferably not higher than about 10°C, still more preferably<br>
not higher than about 0°C) , and a low viscosity (not higher than<br>
about 10 cp at 20°C) ) are preferably taken into consideration.<br>
From the industrial operation viewpoint, a solvent which is<br>
scarcely volatile at ordinary temperature is preferred.<br>
Among the above solvents, in particular, hydrocarbons,<br>
fatty acid esters, ethers and nitriles can be preferably used<br>
in view of the oxidization protection of the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10mentioned above. Additionally, in view of obtaining the high<br>
yield while preferably decreasing the solubility of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10, alcohols, fattyacids, ethers, ketones and nitriles<br>
can be preferably used. From a viewpoint of an industrial<br>
applicability, for example, hydrocarbons and alcohols can be<br>
preferably used.<br>
In the above method (1) , as a means for substituting the<br>
organic solvent solution containing the reduced coenzyme Q10<br>
by water, there maybe mentioned, for example, a method comprising<br>
increasing the water ratio while concentrating and removing the<br>
organic solvent. Furthermore, if necessary, operations such<br>
as cooling and seed crystal addition, as to be described below,<br>
can be combinedly used properly.<br>
Next, the method (2), i.e., the method of crystallizing<br>
the oily reduced coenzyme Q10 in an aqueous solution is explained.<br>
According to this method, the reduced coenzyme Q10 crystal having<br>
a large particle diameter can be obtained, and filterability<br>
can be remarkably improved.<br>
The crystallization may be carried out by adding water to<br>
the oily reduced coenzyme Q10, for example, or on the contrary,<br>
by adding the oily reduced coenzyme Q10 to water. Moreover, the<br>
crystallization may be also carried out by cooling a mixture<br>
of the oily reduced coenzyme Q10 and water. More preferred is<br>
a method comprising removing an organic solvent from a mixed<br>
solvent solution consisting of an organic solvent containing<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 and water at a temperature not lower<br>
than the melting point of the reduced coenzyme Q10 or of a<br>
concentrate comprising the reduced coenzyme Q10 as a main<br>
component, to obtain oil in the system, and cooling to crystallize<br>
the oil.<br>
The above-mentioned temperature not lower than the melting<br>
point is generally 45°C or more, preferably 48°C or more, and<br>
more preferably 50°C or more although it is dependent on the<br>
purity, etc. of the reduced coenzyme Q10. The upper limit is<br>
not particularly restricted but generally 100°C or less is<br>
preferred, 80°C or less is more preferred, and 60°C or less is<br>
still more preferred.<br>
In the crystallization method of the present invention as<br>
described above, the crystallization temperature of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 (cooling temperature at the time of crystallization)<br>
is generally 48°C or less, preferably 45°C or less, more<br>
preferably 40°C or less, and still more preferably 30°C or less<br>
in view of the yield, etc., although it is difficult to uniformly<br>
define since it is dependent on the purity of the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10. The lower limit is a solidification temperature of the<br>
system. Therefore, the crystallization can be especially<br>
preferably carried out at the crystallization temperature of<br>
about 0 to 30°C.<br>
It is preferable to control the amount of crystallization<br>
per unit time in crystallizing, i.e. the rate of crystallization.<br>
The preferable amount of crystallization per unit time is, for<br>
example, not higher than the rate of crystallization which causes<br>
crystallization of about 50%, per unit time, of the whole amount<br>
of crystals to be obtained (i.e. at most 50%/hour), preferably<br>
not higher than the rate of crystallization which causes<br>
crystallization of about 25%, per unit time, of the whole amount<br>
of crystals to be obtained (i.e. at most 25%/hour).<br>
The rate of cooling in the crystallization by cooling is<br>
generally not higher than about 40°C/hour, and preferably not<br>
higher than about 20°C/hour.<br>
The crystallization is preferably carried out under forced<br>
flowing in order to prevent the state of supersaturation from<br>
occurring and thereby allowing the nucleation and crystal growth<br>
to proceed smoothly, in order to obtain crystals with uniform<br>
particle diamater and, furthermore, from the viewpoint of<br>
obtaining high-quality products. The flowing is generally<br>
brought about by a stirring power per unit volume of not weaker<br>
than about 0.01 kW/m3, preferably not weaker than about 0.1 kW/m3,<br>
and more preferably not weaker than about 0.3 kW/m3. The forced<br>
flowing is generally provided by the turning of a stirring<br>
blade (s) . However, the use of a stirring blade (s) is not always<br>
necessary if the above flowing can be otherwise obtained. For<br>
example, it is possible to utilize a method based on liquid<br>
circulation.<br>
In carrying out the crystallization, seed crystals are<br>
preferably added so that the state of supersaturation may be<br>
prevented from occurring and the nucleation and crystal growth<br>
may be allowed to proceed smoothly.<br>
The crystallization concentration, when expressed in terms<br>
of the weight of reduced coenzyme Q10 relative to the total weight<br>
of the crystallization solvent at the time of completion of<br>
crystallization, it is not higher than about 15 w/w%, preferably<br>
not higher than about 13 w/w%, more preferably not higher than<br>
10 w/w%. From the productivity viewpoint, the lower limit to<br>
the crystallization concentration is generally not lower than<br>
about 1 w/w%, preferably not lower than about 2 w/w%.<br>
The thus-obtained crystals of reduced coenzyme Q10 can be<br>
recovered as a wet product, for example, by such a solid-liquid<br>
separation technique as centrifugation, pressure filtration,<br>
or vacuum filtration, if necessary followed by cake washing.<br>
They can be recovered also as a dry product by further charging<br>
the wet product in a reduced pressure drier (vacuum drier)<br>
internally purged with an inert gas and drying the same under<br>
reduced pressure. The recovery in a dry form is preferred.<br>
The crystallization of the invention, when it is carried<br>
out in a deoxygenated atmosphere, can increase protective effect<br>
against oxidation. The deoxygenated atmosphere can be attained<br>
by inert gas substitution, pressure reduction, boiling, or a<br>
combination of these. It is preferable to carry out at least<br>
the substitution with an inert gas, namely to use an inert gas<br>
atmosphere. As the inert gas, there maybe mentioned, for example,<br>
nitrogen gas, helium gas, argon gas, hydrogen gas, and carbon<br>
dioxide gas. Nitrogen gas is preferred, however.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, high-quality<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be obtained with excellent workability<br>
and economical efficiency. The crystals of reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10 as obtained in accordance with the present invention are<br>
of very high quality and can be expected to have a reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio of not lower than 96/4,<br>
preferably not lower than 98/2, more preferably not lower than<br>
99/1.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention<br>
in further detail. These examples are, however, by no means<br>
limitative of the scope of thepresent invention. In the examples,<br>
the purity of reduced coenzyme Q10 and the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 weight ratio were determined by the<br>
HPLC analysis specif ied below. The reduced coenzyme Q10 purity<br>
values as determined, however, are by no means indicative of<br>
the limit purity value attainable in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Likewise, the reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 weight ratio values obtained never indicate the<br>
upper limit to that ratio.<br>

the reduction reaction was carried out at 48°C and at pH 4 to<br>
6. The aqueous phase was removed from the reaction mixture<br>
containing the oil, and the oil was washed 6 times with 1000<br>
g of deaerated saturated brine at 48°C. After that, by removing<br>
the aqueous phase, oily reduced coenzyme Q10 was obtained. 1500<br>
g pf deaerated water, at 48°C was added to this oil, and while<br>
stirring (power required for stirring: 0.3 kW/m3) , the mixture<br>
was cooled to 2°C to obtain white slurry (fluidity of the slurry<br>
was good). All the above operations were carried out under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained slurry was filtered under<br>
reduced pressure, the wet crystal was washed with cold ethanol,<br>
cold water and cold ethanol in this order (the temperature of<br>
the cold solvent used for washing was 2°C) , and further the wet<br>
crystal was dried under reduced pressure (20 to 40°C, 1 to 30<br>
mmHg), 97 g of dry white crystal was obtained (isolated product<br>
yield: 97 mol %) . The weight ratio of the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 of the obtained crystal was 99.4/0.6,<br>
and the purity of the reduced coenzyme Q10 was 99.2%.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
The oxidized coenzyme Q10 (100 g; purity 99.4%) was dissolved<br>
in 1000 g of heptane at 25°C. While stirring (power required<br>
for stirring: 0.3 kW/m3) , an aqueous solution dissolving 100<br>
g of sodiumdithionite (purity 75% or more) , as a reducing agent,<br>
in 1000 ml of water was gradually added and a reduction reaction<br>
was carried out at 25°C and at pH 4 to 6. 2 hours later, an<br>
aqueous phase was removed from the reaction solution, and a<br>
heptane phase was washed 6 times with 1000 g of deaerated saturated<br>
brine. 1000 g of water was added to this heptane phase, and<br>
while stirring (power required for stirring: 0.3kW/m3), heptane<br>
was removed by reducing pressure at 3 0°C to obtain white slurry.<br>
This slurry had good fluidity and was capable to be easily brushed<br>
away from the crystallization container. All the above<br>
operations were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
obtained slurry was filtered under reduced pressure, and the<br>
wet crystal was washed with cold ethanol, cold water and cold<br>
ethanol in this order (the temperature of the cold solvent used<br>
for washing was 2°C) . The wet crystal was further dried under<br>
reduced pressure (20 to 40°C, 1 to 30 mmHg), and a dry white<br>
crystal was obtained ("isolated product yield: 97 mol %) . The<br>
weight ratio of the reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
of the obtained crystal was 99.5 / 0.5, and the purity of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 was 99.2%.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
To 1000 g of ethanol, 100 g of the oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
(purity 99.4%), 60 g of L-ascorbic acid and 30 g of sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate were added, and the mixture was stirred at<br>
78°C and subjected to a reduction reaction. 3 hours later, the<br>
mixture was cooled to 50°C, and 1000 g of heptane and 1000 g<br>
of deaerated water were added while holding said<br>
temperature. After the mixture was cooled to 25°C, an aqueous<br>
phase was removed, and further washed 6 times with 1000 g of<br>
saturatedbrine to remove the aqueous phase. Heptane was removed<br>
from this heptane solution at 48°C to obtain the oily reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10. To this oil, 1500 g of deaerated water at 48°C<br>
was added, and while stirring (power required for stirring: 0.3<br>
kW/m3), the mixture was cooled to 2°C to obtain white slurry<br>
(fluidity of the slurry was good as in Example 1) . All the above<br>
operations were carried out under the nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
obtained slurry was filtered under reduced pressure, and the<br>
wet crystal was washed with cold ethanol, cold water and cold<br>
ethanol in this order (the temperature of the cold solvent used<br>
for washing was 2°C) . The wet crystal was further dried under<br>
reduced pressure (20 to 40°C, 1 to 30 mmHg) to obtain 97 g of<br>
dry white crystal (isolated product yield: 97 mol%). The weight<br>
ratio of the reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 of the<br>
obtained crystal was 99.4/0.6, and the purity of the reduced<br>
coenzyme Q10 was 99.2%.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
A heptane phase of the reduced coenzyme Q10 after being<br>
washed with deaerated saturated brine was obtained in the same<br>
manner as Example 2. While stirring this heptane phase (power<br>
required for stirring: 0.3 kW/m3) , the mixture was cooled to<br>
2°C to obtain white slurry. This slurry was poor in fluidity,<br>
and more difficultly brushed away from the crystallization<br>
container as compared with Example 1. All the above operations<br>
were carried out under the nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained<br>
slurry was filtered under reduced pressure, the wet crystal was<br>
washed with cold ethanol, cold water and cold ethanol in this<br>
order (the temperature of the cold solvent used for washing was<br>
2°C) . The wet crystal was further dried under reduced pressure<br>
(20 to 40°C, 1 to 30 mmHg) to obtain 93 g of dry white crystal<br>
(isolated product yield: 93 mol %) . The weight ratio of the<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 of the obtained crystal<br>
was 99.6/0.4, and the purity of the reduced coenzyme Q10 was<br>
99.3%.<br>
(Reference Example 1)<br>
One gram of the reduced coenzyme Q10 (the weight ratio of<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 is 99.6/0.4) was<br>
dissolved in 20 g of various solvents shown in Table 1 at 25°C. In<br>
the atmosphere, the weight ratio of the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 in the solution after stirring for 24<br>
hours at 25°C, and the result is shown in Table 1.<br>
(Reference Example 2)<br>
One gram of the reduced coenzyme Q10 (the weight ratio of<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 is 99.6/0.4) was<br>
dissolvedin 100 gof various solvents shown in Table 2 at 35°C. In<br>
the atmosphere, the weight ratio of the reduced coenzyme<br>
Q10/oxidized coenzyme Q10 in the solution after stirring for 24<br>
hours at 35°C was measured, and the result is shown in Table<br>
2.<br>
