This  invention  relates   to a Package Clasp.<br>
Presently,   big and bulging suitcases  are prevented from accidental   opening by means  of  a  'luggage  strap' comprising of  a  clasp and a strap.     This  clasp has   two separate units,   a pair  of tongs  and a  receptacle,   fixed to  the loose ends   of   the strap.<br>
Prior to clasping  the  length  of  the strap has  to be adjusted by means  of an adjuster buckle meant for this purpose.     The adjusted  length  of   the strap has   to suit the circumferential   length  of  the  luggage  to be  strapped. Now,   using both   the hands  and with  all   one's might   the tongs  and  receptacle are brought  together  to interlock. This method is   time consuming.     Even after  the precise pre-adjustment of   the adjuster buckle it is  impossible to achieve maximum  tautness.     Further,   it  is  very  difficult for ladies  to  operate  this  clasps.     Also while  carrying heavy  loads  these prongs have been known  to break  under stress.<br>
Another problem  occurs while  trying to tightly secure a box carton with a  rope.     Even after tightening  the   rope, using both  the hands  and  another person's help,   it slackens anyway.     And  for those who are conscious  of  their status it would be embarassing trudging along a  lop-sided  box.<br>
Presently,   there  is no known means   to comfortably carry  a heavy box .carton bound with a  rope like  carrying •a suitcase*  with  a handle.     Carrying the box by means  of the  rope is painful.     As   the rope  is  rough and   its   cross-sectional  area  is   less   it  tends   to cut  through   the  fingers making it sore.     This  can be an  exhausting and  agonising experience when  one has   to cover  long distances  by walk. Further,  due  to   the weight of  the box  the  rope may  even cut   through  it  tending  to  spill   its  contents.<br><br>
Many a time to obviate the aforementioned discomforts of carrying by means of a rope one has to carry it on their shoulders or under arm.  This too can be an embarassing. awkward and excruciating experience.<br>
The object of this invention is to secure the box / carton or like with a single composite clasping system comprising of a single clasp and strap.  Here the box / carton is bound with a strap and locked into position by a clasp effortlessly.  This clasp can  be easily operated by a lady.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide the clasp with a handle that is integral with it.  Thus this concept makes any corrugated box / carton or like 'A Suitcase* to be carried around with ease and dignity.<br>
A further object of this invention is to make the process of tightening and locking the strap in position very simple and unique,  i.e. just a 'tug and press* and the strap stays firmly locked in its place untill required. In the known clasping system this is not possible.  Prior to tightening the strap over the package the required circumferential length of the strap has to be adjusted by using an adjuster buckle provided for this purpose. Even then the strap cannot be tightened to the maximum extent possible.  By this invention, the strap can  be tightened infinitely without any pre-adjustment of the strap.  The strap releasing process is also very simple -•Just press the restraining clip* and it gets loosened.<br>
Another object of this invention is to have a means in the clasp with automatically tightens the strap further just prior to locking the same in position.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to make the clasp in such a way that the frictional grip on the strap increases proportionately with the weight of the carton carried.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of this invention the clasp can be secured from unauthorised tampering by incorporating a locking means like a pad lock, key operated lock, combination number lock or the like to the same.<br>
For better understanding, this invention will now be illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;<br>
FIG.I Shows the front view of the clasp with handle.<br>
FIG*2 Shows the cross sectional side view of the clasp secured to a package with the strap transport sleeve in the unlocked position,<br>
FIG.3 Shows the cross sectional side view of the clasp secured to the same package with the sleeve in the locked position.<br>
For the purpose of clarity only those parts actually involved in demonstrating the working of this invention are shown and the contacting parts are also shown as apart.<br>
REF. FIG.I; Shows the clasp comprising of a strap transport sleeve 1 hinged by means of pin 4 to the body 2. The strap transport sleeve 1 is interlocked to body 2 by means of two restraining clips 3 preloaded by spring 8, To increase the frictional grip on strap 5 the contacting surfaces of the strap transport sleeve 1 and body 2 are provided with cogs 7 and resilient material 6 respectively. A soft moulded handle 9 is fixed to the clasp assembly.<br><br>
REF. FIG. 2:  The  clasp comprises of body 2 on to which is hinged the strap transport sleeve 1 by means of pin 4. The strap transport sleeve 1 swings back and forth (see arrow) between two restraining clips 3 fixed to body 2 and is locked and released by th&amp;a  accordingly.  The underside of the strap transport sleeve 1 is provided with cogs 7,<br>
In order to securely sandwich strap 5 between the underside of the strap transport sleeve 1 and resilient material 6 it is essential that their contacting surfaces complement each other.  The resilient member 6 also lines the inner surface of the mortise 15 at the rear end of the body 2 to form points A &amp; B.<br>
The resilient material 6 too has cogs 7 (a) which alternate with those on the underside of strap transport sleeve 1.  These alternating cogs 7 and 7 (a) further help to enmesh and grip the strap 5.<br>
TO OPERATE; The clasp is placed on the package 11 that is to be harnessed and carried.  The strap 5 is passed around it (see direction of arrow on the strap 5) and then goes through the strap transport sleeve 1 via strap guide 13. The strap 5 is pulled by hand 12 to the maximum extent possible thus tightening the package 11.  Here the strap 5 is under continuous tension while the hinge is under friction.  When impossible to tighten any further the strap 5 is thrust towards the front side of the clasp taking the strap transport sleeve 1 along with it.<br>
REF. FIG.3$  In continuation of this forward movement when the position of the strap transport sleeve 1 is approximately 130° the tenon 8 at its rear end (over<br><br>
which the exposed part of the strap 5 is passing) digs into the resilient member 6 at point B, in the mortise 15, thereby preventing recoil of strap 5.  On pressing the strap transport sleeve 1 a little further the friction between the resiliant member 6 and strap 5 is further increased by the leverage gained.  Further, movement of strap transport sleeve 1 opens the restraining clips 3 and after that it (restraining clips 3) closes to interlock the strap transport sleeve 1 and body 2 thereby gripping the strap 5# until disengaged intentionally.<br>
ThuS/ the strap 5 is securely gripped due to the following factors:-<br>
a.	As the strap transport sleeve 1 and body 2 are snugly<br>
interlocked by restraining clips 3 the entire surface<br>
area of the resilient member 6 exerts frictional<br>
pressure on strap 5 at points A, B, C &amp; D,<br>
b.	The alternating cogs 7 and 7 (a) and the minimum<br>
permissible gap between them causes the strap 5 to<br>
get enmeshed.<br>
c.	Due to the leverage generated by the strap transport<br>
sleeve 1# extreme frictional pressure is exerted on<br>
the strap# by the tenon 8 engaging the mortise 15# at<br>
points A &amp; B of the resilient member 6.<br>
d.	The frictional pressure on strap 5 at point B can be<br>
enhanced further by means of a pressure adjusting screw<br>
14 (See Figs. 2 and 3), cam or by driving a wedge*<br>
e.	The Strap 5 is tugged at point D by the weight of the<br>
package 11 thereby increasing its frictional grip<br>
proportionately as  seen in Fig.3.<br>
The novelty here is to make this clasp in such a way that5-1.  The strap can be tightened at any point without any limitation and that too effortlessly due to the friction between the contacting parts and leverage gained.<br><br>
2.   there is  absolutely  no need  for  any pre-adjustment of the strap's   length prior to  clasping.<br>
3.   There are five factors   (a  to e)  herein before described, contributing  to  its   gripping ability hence  the  clasp  is capable of carrying heavy loads  safely.<br>
4.	as   the strap   transport sleeve  1   is   thrust  forward   the<br>
tenon 8 at  its   rear  end  automatically  tightens   the<br>
strap  5 further until  it  gets   locked  into position<br>
by  the restraining clips  3.<br>
5.	to gain further frictional   resistance,   if  required   (see Figs.   2 &amp; 3),   the weight  of   the package 11  can  be  transferred  via  the strap   5  on to  the  strap    transport sleeve 1   (by a means  10  and  corresponding means  on  strap   transport sleeve  1).     Thus  the frictional   resistance  on all the contacting surfaces  increases proportionately with the weight of package carried.<br>
6.	by means  of   the soft handle,   this  concept makes  any corrugaged  box / carton or like   'a Suitcase'   to be carried around with  ease and dignity.<br>
With  the advent  of engineering plastics having fantastic physical,  mechanical  and hinging properties   the configuration and shape  of  various parts  can be veried  accordingly to make  the  clasp more compact  and   effective without departing from  the scope  of  this   invention.<br>
While I have described  and   illustrated  the aforesaid embodiments  of my present invention of a clasp,   I  do not wish  to  limit myself   to the exact  form shown,   described and  illustrated.     The  illustration  is   intended   to show how best  the  invention  can be performed   rather  than  limit   the scope  of  the same.     It  is  also   to be  expressly  understood<br><br>
that this invention is susceptible to such changes and modifications which shall define no material departure from the salient features of this invention herein described and illustrated.<br><br><br><br><br>
