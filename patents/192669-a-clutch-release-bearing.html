This invention relates to a clutch release bearing.<br>
The known clutch release bearing (CRB), also called a clutch carbon assembly, consists of a metal housing enclosing a carbon ring through which the drive shaft of the vehicle, such as, a tractor, passes. Both the housing and the ring are one piece units so much so that while replacing a worn out CRB, the operation involves a time consuming and tedious procedure which finally results in sliding the worn out CRB off the drive shaft and replacing it with a new CRB.<br>
Such operation, apart from being time consuming and tedious, requires the use of sophisticated tools which are not available with all mechanics. Besides, the vehicle, usually a tractor in which the CRB is used, will have to be towed to a garage, often far from the place where it is put to work.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a CRB which eliminates the foregoing drawbacks. Removal and replacement of the proposed CRB now means  nothing<br><br>
more than a job which can be accomplished with a spanner and screwdriver taking about 15 minutes or so, in contrast to the time taken for removal and replacement of the conventional CRB which is anything up to and over 45 minutes in a fully equipped workshop.<br>
The replacement operation involving the proposed CRB can be carried out even by a semi-skilled person at the site where the vehicle is situated.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following description.<br>
The clutch release bearing, according to this invention, comprises a housing enclosing a carbon ring through which the drive shaft of the vehicle is enabled to pass, characterised in that the housing is made up of two split parts detachably attachable to each other by fastening means; and the carbon ring is also made up of two corresponding split parts respectively fixed to the inner periphery of the split parts of the housing, whereby whenever the split parts of the housing  are  attached to each other,  the  split<br><br>
parts of the carbon ring are seated against each other to form a continuous piece, the dimensions of the split parts of the housing, however, being such that the said parts are easily slipped off the drive shaft or slipped on over the drive shaft.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate the known CRB and, by way of example, one of various possible embodiments of this invention.  In the drawings,<br>
Fig.l illustrates the known CRB<br>
Fig.2 illustrates an embodiment of the CRB proposed herein in its assembled state<br>
and<br>
Fig.3 illustrates the aforementioned embodiment in its disassembled state.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, the known CRB will be seen to consist of the metal housing H enclosing the carbon  ring R.  Both the housing and  the  carbon<br><br>
ring are of a single piece construction. Consequently, whenever the housing (with ring) is to be slipped off the drive shaft or slipped on over the drive shaft, the procedure involved is time consuming and tedious as explained above, since various parts of the vehicle will have to be dismantled and then reassembled before the job can be completed.<br>
Figs.2 and 3 illustrate an embodiment of this invention. The housing HI consists of two split parts A and B which are attachable to, and detachable from each other by fastening means such as the flanges F provided for the part A and the insert I provided for the part B, which can be fastened and unfastened by the bolt and nut E.<br>
The carbon ring Rl also consists of two corresponding split parts C and D fixed to the inner periphery of the parts A and B, by means, such as an adhesive.<br>
When the parts A and B of the housing are fastened together, the parts C and D of the ring seat themselves against each other to form a continuous<br><br>
p1ece Fig.2)<br>
It will thus be seen that the proposed CRB can be slipped off the drive shaft or slipped on over the drive shaft by detaching the parts A and B and attaching them onc e again.<br>
The dimensions of the parts A and B of the housing must, however, be such that they can be easily slipped off the drive shaft or slipped on over the drive shaft.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation,there being no intention in the use of such terms and express ions of exc1uding any equiva1ents of the features i11ustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the CRB proposed herein are possita1e without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
l.A clutch release bearing comprising a housing enclosing a carbon ring through which the drive shaft of the vehicle is enabled to pass, characterised in that the housing is made up of two split parts detachably attachable to each other by fastening means; and the carbon ring is also made up of two corresponding split parts respectively fixed to the inner periphery of the split parts of the housing, whereby whenever the split parts of the hosuing are attached to each other, the split parts of the carbon ring are seated against each other to form a continuous piece, the dimensions of the split parts of the housing, however, being such that the said parts are easily slipped off the drive shaft and slipped on over the drive shaft.<br>
2.A clutch release bearing as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the split parts of the housing are attachable to, and detachable from, each other by fastening means, such as, two flanges provided for one  of said parts and an insert provided for  the<br><br>
other part, said flanges and insert being fastenable and unfastenable by a bolt and nut provided therefor.<br>
3.A clutch release bearing substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated by, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
