				<td>Method for the preparation of aerogels<br>
The present invention is referred to a process for the<br>
preparation of aerogels including an exchange phase of the<br>
liquid present in the wet gel by xenon and a following<br>
extraction of very xenon.<br>
Aerogels are one of possible products of a sol-gel process.<br>
Aerogels, up to now, have found application mainly in the<br>
thermoacoustic insulation and in chemical catalysis, as<br>
well as intermediate materials in production of glasses and<br>
glass ceramics; a new application, currently under study,<br>
is an insulation layer of very low dielectric constant in<br>
the production of integrated circuits.<br>
It is known that the sol-gel processes are chemical<br>
processes according to which a material is produced from a<br>
mixture of suitable precursors (called sol), such a<br>
material being typically a simple or mixed oxide either as<br>
a bulk or as a thin layer onto a carrier.<br>
Sol-gel processes are the subject of important published<br>
patent documents and are described, for example, in the<br>
following patents: US-A-4.574.063, US-A-4.680.048, US-A-<br>
4.810.674, US-A-4.961.767 and US-A-5.207.814.<br>
Water, alcohols and water/alcohol mixtures are usually<br>
employed as solvent/diluent for the starting solution, the<br>
precursors may be soluble salts of metals and/or of<br>
metalloids, for example nitrates, chlorides and acetates or<br>
preferably they may be compounds of the general formula<br>
M(OR)n where M is the metal or metalloid atom, O-R is an<br>
alcoholic radical (typically from an alcohol containing<br>
from one to four carbon atoms) and n is the valence of M.<br>
Among the most frequently used precursors in sol-gel<br>
processes are tetramethoxysilane (known as TMOS) with the<br>
formula Si(OCH3)4 and tetraethoxysilane (known as TEOS)<br>
with the formula Si(OCH2CH3)4.<br>
The first phase of a sol-gel process is the precursor<br>
hydrolysis from water that may be present as solvent or be<br>
purposely added in the case of alcoholic solutions,<br>
according to the reaction:<br>
M(-0R)n+nH20- M(OH)n + n ROH (I)<br>
This phase is generally helped by low pH values: typically<br>
between 0 and 3, preferably between about 1 and 2.<br>
The second phase in the sol-gel process is the condensation<br>
of the M(OH)n species according to the following scheme:<br>
M(OH)n + M(OH)n ? (OH)n-1 M-O-M(OH)n-1 + H2O (II)<br>
This reaction, extended to all the M(OH)n species<br>
originally present in solution, leads to an inorganic<br>
oxidic polymer with an open structure inglobating within<br>
its porosity all the solvent originally present or<br>
generated during the hydrolysis. The inorganic, oxidic<br>
polymer so produced is called gel.<br>
To find practical application, the gel needs to be dried by<br>
careful extraction of all liquid from its pores.<br>
A possible method of drying a gel is by simple solvent<br>
evaporation; the dry gel so produced is known as a.<br>
"Xerogel". As it is known to the experts in the field, the<br>
production of xerogels is extremely difficult because of<br>
the strong capillary forces produced by the solvent on the<br>
pore wall: during evaporation, that normally lead to the<br>
destruction of the gel.<br>
An alternative method for producing dry gels is the<br>
supercritical (or hypercritical) extraction of the solvent.<br>
Dry gels produced- by this technique are known as<br>
"Aerogels".<br>
During the hypercritical drying in suitable autoclaves the<br>
liquid present in the gel is subjected to values of<br>
temperature and pressure that exceeds the critical values<br>
specific for that liquid. At that moment the whole liquid<br>
volume passes from the liquid phase to that of<br>
supercritical fluid and the related capillary forces inside<br>
the pores decrease from the initial value to the reduced<br>
value proper of the supercritical fluid. It is so avoided<br>
the destructive phase of the; meniscus presence inside the<br>
pores that is always produced by evaporations during the<br>
preparation of xerogels. The technique of hypercritical<br>
extraction of a liquid from a gel is described, for<br>
example, in<br>
US-A-4.432.956 e US-A-5.395.805. The main problem with this<br>
technique is that alcohols, normally present in the gel<br>
pores have critical pressure Pc typically above 60-70 bars<br>
and critical temperatures Tc above 250oC. Such critical<br>
values mandate the use of autoclaves of high resistance and<br>
relatively high cost. Moreover, if the gel product is in<br>
the form of film on support (for example in the case of a<br>
dielectric insulating film on an integrated circuit), the<br>
critical temperatures of alcohols and esters might be too<br>
high and not compatible with the support or with other<br>
materials present on it.<br>
A well known technique to overcome the problem is through<br>
the liquid exchange in the wet gel before hypercritical<br>
extraction, with a liquid of more favorable critical<br>
constants, particularly of lower Tc. For example, it is<br>
possible to use hydrocarbons, as pentane and hexane, that<br>
have critical temperature in the range of 200°C. Even in<br>
this case, however, the Tc value might be not compatible<br>
with all the applications predictable with aerogels;<br>
moreover the exchange of an hydroalcoholic liquid with an<br>
hydrocarbon, because of the non mixibility of these liquids<br>
would require an additional exchange with intermediate<br>
liquids as, for example, acetone, with the consequent<br>
expansion of the process time and of the cost of recycling<br>
the organic solvents.<br>
Still another possibility is to exchange the hydroalcoholic<br>
liquid with liquid CO2, that has a very favorable Tc value<br>
(about 35oC); also this liquid, however, is not miscible<br>
with water and requires the use of an intermediate exchange<br>
liquid. Acetone, in this case, is not suitable because, if<br>
mixed with liquid CO2, prevents it from entering<br>
hypercritical transition; it is possible to use, as an<br>
intermediate exchange liquid, isoamylacetate; but, also in<br>
this case, the double exchange (acetone first, amylacetate<br>
after) requires process-time excessively long for an<br>
industrial process and undesirable solvent-recycling costs.<br>
The Applicant has now found that it is possible to prepare<br>
the aerogels without no drawback among the ones belonging<br>
to the known art and, according to a preferred embodiment,<br>
through a hypercritical extraction step carried out at<br>
moderate pressure and temperature values which,<br>
furthermore, does not need long times in the preceding<br>
liquid exchange in the wet gel.<br>
As a matter of fact, an object of the present invention is<br>
a method for the preparation of aerogels comprising the<br>
exchange of the aquagel liquid phase with xenon, the<br>
extraction of xenon and the possible recover thereof;<br>
particular advantages are achievable by carrying out the<br>
exchange with liquid xenon and the extraction thereof under,<br>
supercritical conditions.<br>
The aquagel preparation can be made following one of the<br>
preparative process reported in the state of the art; for<br>
example, by hydrolysis of a suitable precursor. In this<br>
case, the process will involve a preliminary step of<br>
hydrolysis/condensation starting from the suitable<br>
precursor.<br>
A peculiar embodiment of the present invention is the<br>
preparation of the aerogels including:<br>
a) hydrolysis/condensation starting from a precursor;<br>
b) exchange of the liquid in the gel with xenon<br>
c) supercritical extraction of xenon<br>
d) possible xenon recovering.<br>
The metallic precursor undergoing the hydrolysis reaction<br>
may be whatever compound known in the art. Therefore, use<br>
may be made of soluble salts such as, for instance,<br>
nitrates, chlorides and acetate; moreover, use can be made,<br>
according to the best carrying out, of alcoxydes or<br>
alcoxyde mixtures having the general formula:<br>
X-Me-(OR)n-1<br>
wherein Me is a metal of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Groups of the<br>
Element Periodic System; n is Me valence; X is R or OR, R<br>
being acid alkyl radical, linear or branched, having a<br>
carbon atom number up to 10.<br>
The hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, preferably of the acid kind, and water may be the<br>
solvent, or it may be added to the precursor alcoholic<br>
solution; the relevant conditions and procedure are<br>
reported in the known art such as, for instance, the one<br>
corresponding to US patent no.5.207.814 according to which<br>
the hydrolysis is carried out at room temperature and<br>
preferred acid catalysts are chloride acid, nitric acid and<br>
acetic acid. Metal oxides, mainly silicon oxide, can be<br>
added to the prepared sol to modify the properties thereof,<br>
according to, for instance, US patent no.5.207.814.<br>
The liquid present in the wet gel is exchanged with xenon<br>
having critical temperature, Tc = 16,6oC and critical<br>
pressure, Pc = 58,4 bars, over very short times. Once the<br>
exchange is completed, xenon is easily extracted without<br>
any use of autoclave suitable for high temperature and<br>
pressure.<br>
Xenon, as known, is a gas at atmospheric pressure and<br>
temperature; it belong to the class of the so called rare<br>
gases, and traditional is utilized in discharge lamps, in<br>
solar lamps, in arch lamps for the production of U.V.<br>
radiations, to excite laser cavities, for ionization<br>
chambers, in the bubble chambers for the detection of<br>
elementary particles.<br>
For the purposes of the current invention, the xenon is<br>
maintained liquid with pressure above 58,4 bars and<br>
temperature below 16,6°C, preferably below 10°C. To favor<br>
interdiffusion processes in the liquid phase within the<br>
pore structure, xenon temperature should be not as low,<br>
usually not lower than 0°C.<br>
Considering the high cost of xenon, the method of the<br>
invention is preferably used with systems that provide the<br>
recovery of xenon at the end of the extraction process.<br>
A possible scheme of this type of system is indicated in<br>
Fig.l, to which we here refer merely as an example<br>
excluding any restrictive consideration.<br>
System A of Fig.l is an example of process of<br>
hypercritically drying an aquagel using exclusively xenon.<br>
The system includes a reservoir of liquid xenon 1,<br>
connected through a line 2 to at least one, but preferably<br>
several moulds 3, (Fig.l shows a system of 3 moulds)<br>
containing the original aquagels. The moulds are connected<br>
with discharge lines 4, for the liquid exchanged in the<br>
pores (water and/or alcohol) and gaseous xenon at the end<br>
of the supercritical extraction process. All lines 4 are<br>
converging into one suitable collector 5, with proper<br>
temperature under which water and alcohol are solid while<br>
xenon is in the liquid phase., for example at: a temperature<br>
between about -30°C and -40°C. Finally collector 5 is<br>
connected to a reservoir 6 for the recovered xenon, that in<br>
certain models could be the same reservoir 1. The system is<br>
supplied with open/closed valve, identified as V in Fig.l,<br>
that provide selective insulation of any component of the<br>
system. In addition, on the line 2 before each mould 3,<br>
there can be connected flow-meters F, to regulate xenon<br>
flux in each mould; to each mould is connected a pressure<br>
gage P, to control pressure in each mould.<br>
More in general, liquid xenon at temperatures between 0*C<br>
and 16°C can be flown inside the aquagels to replace the<br>
liquid originally contained so that a xenongel is obtained.<br>
The xenongel is then subjected to hypercritical or<br>
supercritical drying at a temperature above 16,6°C and<br>
pressure above 58,4 bars.<br>
