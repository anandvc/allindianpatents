				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved gully trap, namely a gutter, particularly for waste water pipe.<br>
This invention more particularly refers a gully or gully trap for waste water closet, used in homes, hospitals and other public places, such as the toilets, urinals, even the rain water escapes along city roads. The gully trap of the present invention has wide application in the industrial plant, particularly chemical plants for the safe disposal of the waste liquids likely to give off harmful gases, fumes and vapours.<br>
In normal drains polluted waste water are drained out through waste water pipe or drain pipe, which normally is covered with grills. The size of the openings in said grills may vary depending on the nature of the use for the prevention of passage of the waste solid particles.<br>
In the conventional gully trap, the drainage system is covered with grating or mesh thereby preventing the passage of solid particles, larger than size of the mesh holes. This is done so that the entry of the solid and semisolid particles may not cause blockage or choking of the drainage systems. However, such grating or mesh having holes of different sizes, depending upon the nature of its use, will not prevent bad smell from the drain, from spreading all over, and drainage system further would not prevent  germs  micro-organism  insects   such   as   cockroaches,    flies,<br>
2<br><br>
mosquitoes, rats which are generated inside the drains, from contaminating our well being and environment, leaving us vulnerable to a hordes of harmful sicknesses. The conventional drainage system thereby causes unfavourable ecological imbalance, game times the inlet end of the drainage system is covered with lids without perforation or holes In an effort to exclude the bad effects of the conventional drains, but this create more problem than solving them.<br>
It has been the endeavour of the present invention to avoid the drawbacks experienced in the known types of drainage system.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to allow the waste water from the toilet and industrial waste liquid to flow from one direction to the disposal end without allowing the movement of  the  unfavourable  elements  of  the  dram  in  the   reverse<br>
direction.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to have a safety gully trap which will prevent the obnoxious and unpleasant germ laden Smell from propagating from the drainage system to pollute the atmosphere, inside the toilet homes and the surrounding areas.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to have an improved type of drainage system which avoids all the drawbacks of the existing types of gutter or water works.<br>
3<br><br>
The safety gully trap under discussion comprises of a main body which may be rectangular, square, oval, circular or any other shape and size as per the prevailing requirements. The said main body is having a central opening for waste water disposal and a circular indented portion around the central opening, which accommodates the circular protrution of the second body, may be called the cover. The cover having perforation or holes along its periphery, which allows the water into the drain. The safety gully trap is described in details with references to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The material for the construction may be metal, fibre, plastics, ceramics or whatever found suitable.<br>
Another important advantage of the safety gully trap is its compactness, the ease with which it can be installed in places of shallow depths, such as the concrete floors of a multi storied building without disturbing the ceiling directly below it. Tradional gully trap may be gouged out and the same cavity may be used for installing the safety gully trap.<br>
An additional vital point is the ease with which it can be maintained. For maintenance the central cover is taken off which games out easily and also refitted quite easily on the body. Any accumulation found in the body cavity (14) may be taken off. Any hair or fibres found on the spider, riding the top of the central<br>
4<br><br>
hole, can be removed, in fact the removal of the spider exposes the  drain  hole  through  the central  hole,  for  clearing  off<br>
blockages.<br>
The central hole (15) of fig.l, may be fitted with mesh discs 
It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a gully grap having a compact size, environmental friendly, easy to clean and maintain. Offering maximum protection and benefits to the user, including freedom from health hazzard and assuring a clean and healthy atmosphere. These and ether objects of the invention will be more clear from the description given hereafter.<br>
Figure 1 show a sectional view of the main body of the safety gully trap.<br>
Fig. 2 showe a plan and sectional view of the cover body.<br>
Fig. 3 is the assembly of the main body with the cover body of the drainage system of the present invention.<br>
5<br><br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, the main body (fig 1) is having a rectangular structure which may be oval, circular, square or any other geometrical shape. Said main body (10) is having a base element (19) which is intended to accommodate the cover body (fig.2). The main body is having a central disposal hole (15) which acts as the outlet of the gully trap.<br>
Said main body (10) has a circular cavity inward (14) to maintain a permanent pool of water when the gully grap la in use. The depth of the cavity is suitably adjusted to accommodate the circular wall (18) of the cover body (fig.2).<br>
Said cover body is a circular device with plurality of holes (39) of pre-determined size along its periphery, for the inlet of water in to the gully trap assembly. The under side of the cover body has a circular wall (18) of predetermined height (fig.2) the diamater of the cover body be such that it sits on the shoulder (19) of the main body.<br>
With the cover body in place over the main body as in (fig.3) the full assembly is completed. When this assembly is installed over the drain pipe of the drainage system, a small amount of water will fill the cavity (14) of the main body forming a permanent pool of water, the depth of the permanent pool will be determined constant by the wall (12) of the central hole (15) of the body so that any additional water through the water inlet hole (39)  will<br>
6<br><br>
cause the water level of the permanent pool to rise and finally over flow over the wall (12) of the central disposal hole, which is drained off.<br>
With the cover body over the main body and the permanent pool full, the tip of the circular wall (18) of the cover body will dip below the water surface of the permanent pool. In so doing the permanent pool of water will be divided into an inner circle of water and an outer circle of water. So all contact of the surfaces of the inner circle of water and the outer circle of water will be broken. However, the bottom of both the surfaces (inner and outer) is still common . Any addition of water into the gully trap through the cover body water inlet hole (39) will cause both the water surfaces to rise and finally drain off by over f1owing over the wall (12) of the central hole (15) for disposal, the same amount that has been added. So a free flow of water is maintained into the disposal hole.<br>
In operating condition the inner surface of water and the outer Surface of water are separated from each other by the circular wall (18) of cover body. The inner circle of water, central disposal hole, and the space above it are subject to the same foul environmental condition that prevails within the drainage system. But this condition does not reach the outer surface of water  to which our surroundings are concerned, due to the  water<br>
7<br><br>
surface barrier caused by the circular wall of the cower body, therefore insects like cockroaches, flies, mosquitoes, rats, germs, plagues, bad smell, micro-organism, bearing hordes of mortal diseases, cannot escape to our surroundings, assuring us freedom  from  the  scourge of the long tolerated  bad  drainage<br>
Any solid particles flowing into the gully trap along with the water will be trapped by the predetermined holes of the cover body. Only the water and smaller solid particles will pass into the drain out to the disposal port- Smaller particles below the size of the cover body holes may accumulate into the cavity ( 14 ) . All accumulation is easily cleared off either by the addition of water into the gully trap or thrown out. There is enough space provided between the tip of the circular wall (12) Of the cover body and the bottom of the cavity (14) of the main body. Also there Is enough room between the circular wall (18) of the cover body and the wall (12) of the central disposal hole, and between the outer wall of the main body. If at all any choke up or blockage in free passage of water is observed the central cover body can be lifted off easily and the necessary clean-up is done.<br>
The gully trap of the present invention can have a different shapeand size depending on its applicability without altering  the main features thereof as described and  illustrated<br>
8<br><br>
9<br>
in the drawings. All such modification and the improvement of the gully trap will be within the knowledge of a person. The gully trap of the present invention is therefore an example among other suitable modifications and all such gully traps will be within the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
