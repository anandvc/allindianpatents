				<td>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, RETRIEVAL AND DISPLAY SYSTEM<br>
AND ASSOCIATED METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention is a computerized system and method for searching through and<br>
retrieving information from an informational resource; and more particularly, the present<br>
invention is an information management, retrieval and display system for searching through an<br>
informational resource and for displaying the results of the search in an collapsible/expandable<br>
format based upon a user-selected display criteria or hierarchy.<br>
An inherent drawback in many conventional search engines or search tools, such as<br>
Infoseek™, AltaVista™, Hotbot™, is that the results of the search are typically organized<br>
according to the number of hits that the search word or phrase made in each document (Web<br>
page) being searched. This type of search result display requires the end user to go through the<br>
hits one by one in order to finally access the document he/she was looking for. Another<br>
drawback with such conventional search engines is that the results of the search do not take into<br>
account that a word may have several different meanings, and may be used in many different<br>
contexts. For example, if an end user were looking for information on a cartoon mouse, because<br>
the search query would contain the word "mouse," the list of hits will include documents for the<br>
electronic cursor-control devices, documents providing biological information on mice,<br>
documents providing pet information on mice, etc. Therefore, the end user may have to go<br>
through an enormous number of these hits before finally (if ever) reaching a hit related to the<br>
cartoon mouse.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a search engine or search tool that allows the end user to that<br>
arranges the search results in a manner that allows the end user to effectively and quickly obtain<br>
items of interest.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is an information management, retrieval and display system for<br>
searching through an informational resource, such as a document (e.g.. a treaty), a number of<br><br>
individual documents (e.g., Web pages resident on the Internet), or a stream of information (e.g..<br>
DNA code, source code, satellite data transmissions, etc.) and for displaying the results of the<br>
search in an collapsible/expandable format based upon a user-selected display criteria or<br>
hierarchy. Such a display hierarchy will allow the end-user to effectively and quickly obtain<br>
items of interest from the search results. The type or format of the informational resource is not<br>
critical.<br>
The invention includes four primary modules, a break module, an indexing module, a<br>
search module and an un-break module. The break module is an expert system operating upon a<br>
set of expert rules that define its operation. The break module parses through the informational<br>
resource to break up the informational resource into finite elements (such as paragraphs, sections,<br>
sub-sections, segments etc.). The break module also creates categorical tags for each of these<br>
finite elements, where the categorical tags assigned to each of the finite elements are based upon<br>
and analysis (defined by the set of expert system rules) of the contents of each of the finite<br>
elements. The categorical tag can include a standard classification such as, for example, "Dewey<br>
Decimal-type" number. The categorical tag can also include an organizational attribute (such as<br>
pertaining to the type or location of the finite element with respect to the rest of<br>
informational resource), a date-stamp, a categorical word, etc. Preferably, the categorical tags<br>
are inserted into the finite element.<br>
The index module parses through the finite elements identified/created/processed by the<br>
break module and creates a searchable database having a database record for each of the finite<br>
elements identified by the break module. The searchable database is a type of reverse index,<br>
where each record includes an address or location of the corresponding finite element (and, in<br>
turn, the categorical tag included therewith), and strings (such as words, phrases, etc.) contained<br>
in the finite element and their frequency (i.e., their weight) within the finite element.<br>
In applications where the users of the invention do not have control of the information<br>
being searched (i.e., Web pages on the Internet), each database record may also include the<br>
categorical tag, since the categorical tag will not be able to be inserted by the break module into<br>
the finite elements themselves. Furthermore, with the Web search application, it may not be<br>
necessary to utilize the break and un-break modules at all since each Web-page or link might be<br>
considered a finite-element for the purposes of the present invention.<br><br>
Once the reverse index is created, a search of the reverse index may be performed. Key<br>
strings (such as key words, phrases or symbol segments) may be supplied by an end user as a<br>
search query, and a display hierarchy or criteria may also be selected or defined by the user. The<br>
selected display criteria will instruct the search module how to manipulate the data of the search<br>
results. Specifically, the selected display criteria will define if the search results are to be<br>
displayed in an order or structure based entirely upon the information contained within the<br>
categorical tags (research-centric), if the search results are to be displayed in an order depending<br>
entirely upon the frequency of the key strings present in the finite elements (conventional), or if<br>
the search results are to be displayed in an order or structure based upon a combination of the<br>
two (document-centric).<br>
The search module accesses the search query and searches through the reverse index for<br>
database records matching the specific search term or query. The search results are then<br>
displayed in an collapsible/expandable (tree) structure by applying the information in the<br>
categorical tags for each of the finite elements satisfying the search criteria to the selected display<br>
hierarchy. For example, if the selected hierarchy is a document-centric hierarchy, a first level of<br>
the display hierarchy may-be, for example, the year in which the finite element was created; a<br>
second level of the display hierarchy may be, for example, the order in which the finite elements<br>
appear in the document; and a third level of the display hierarchy may be, for example, based<br>
upon the frequency in which the search words appear in each of the finite elements. The<br>
operation of the search module, as with the break and index modules, is based upon a set of<br>
expert rules. Therefore, if the search results are not satisfactory, the expert rules in the break,<br>
index and/or search modules are modified and the procedure is performed again.<br>
Once one of the finite elements in the search result display are selected by the end-user,<br>
the un-break module allows the end user to view a contiguous portion of the informational<br>
resource that the selected finite element belongs to. The un-break module will assemble selected<br>
finite element with other related finite element to reconstruct the contiguous portion of the<br>
informational resource. The un-break module refers to the categorical tag of the selected finite<br>
element for information related to the location of the finite element with respect to the entire<br>
informational resource, and will then build a portion of the informational resource from all of the<br>
finite elements belong to that portion. For example, if the selected finite element is a paragraph<br><br>
of a document, the un-break module may be configured to rebuild the chapter of the document to<br>
which the paragraph belongs. As with the other modules of the present invention, the operation<br>
of the un-break module is controlled by a set of expert rules that may be modified if the results<br>
are unsatisfactory.<br>
It is envisioned that the rule sets will be created and refined by an expert on the document<br>
or information being searched. For example, if the system of the present invention is to be<br>
associated with Volume 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations, an individual (or group of<br>
individuals) with intimate knowledge of the Volume would be best suited to generate and fine-<br>
tune the rule sets. The fine-tuning of the rule sets would involve the individual continuously<br>
performing example searches on the Volume using the rule sets, and continuously modifying the<br>
rule sets to obtain the search results with the desired content and format. Once the rule sets have<br>
been fine-tuned, the search module of the present invention can be packaged along with the<br>
Volume and sold or distributed as a searchable Volume. Likewise, the search module could<br>
operate on a Web-site so that users can access the Web-site and perform searches on the Volume.<br>
Since the rule sets have already been defined and fine-tuned by the "experts," the users would<br>
have a fully operable search engine that performs searches and displays results in accordance<br>
with an expert's intimate knowledge with the Volume,<br>
As mentioned above, it is also envisioned that an embodiment of the invention is<br>
designed to search through a number of individual Web pages resident on the Internet and to<br>
display the results of the search in an collapsible/expandable format based upon a user-selected<br>
display criteria or hierarchy. In such an embodiment, a break moduie in the form described<br>
above may not be necessary because each Web page may already be considered to be a "finite<br>
element" and the search engine will not be able to modify the Web pages. Accordingly, in such<br>
an application, the index module will parse through each of the Web pages (finite elements) to<br>
create a searchable database having a record for each of the Web pages. Each record in the<br>
searchable database will include the Web address of rhe Web page, non-common words<br>
contained in the Web page along with their frequency (weight), and a categorical tag, as<br>
described above, which includes data based upon an analysis of the contents of the Web page.<br>
The index module will also review each of the Web pages to determine if the creator of the Web'<br>
page had embedded a categorical tag into the Web page itself; and if such an embedded<br><br>
categorical tag is found, the index module may simply insert this pre-defined categorical tag into<br>
the database record rather than creating one itself. Therefore, as the present invention becomes<br>
more prevalently used on the Internet, Web page creators may desire to create their own<br>
categorical tags for their Web pages rather than having the search engine create one for them.<br>
With this feature, the Web page designer may be able to influence the search results, perhaps to<br>
achieve a more accurate depiction of the Web site. Of course, such a feature may also be used by<br>
the Web designers in a deceptive manner, where the categorical tag will cause the Web page to<br>
be listed in search results when the searcher is looking for an entirely different type of<br>
information. Recognizing this potential problem, the index module will include an option where<br>
it will compare the actual contents of the Web page against the embedded categorical tags, and<br>
will create a new categorical tag to be inserted into the database record if there is a significant<br>
difference. Likewise, the index module can be configured to filter out Web sites having<br>
undesirable or unsavory content as indicated by the embedded categorical tags or as determined<br>
by a review of the content of the Web page itself.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the dynamic expert rule sets may be configured<br>
to accept and index all manner of static and dynamic information (such as news-feeds, data<br>
transmissions, etc.) on a global scale where an end-user will be able to efficiently and quickly<br>
obtain any sort of information he/she wishes from a hierarchal search result display based upon a<br>
categorical organization scheme such as the Dewey-Decimal system.<br>
Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, a method for retrieving information from an<br>
informational resource comprises the steps of: (a) dividing the informational resource into a<br>
plurality of finite elements; (b) assigning a categorical tag to each of the plurality of finite<br>
elements, where the categorical tag includes data pertaining to a content of the finite element; (c)<br>
generating a searchable database record for each of the plurality of finite elements, where each<br>
searchable database record includes at least one string contained within the finite element, where<br>
the string can be a word, a phrase, a symbol, a group of symbols, a data segment or the like; (d)<br>
supplying a search string; (e) searching the searchable database for searchable database records<br>
containing the search string; (f) arranging the results of the searching step in a hierarchal<br>
structure according, at least in part, to the data in the categorical tags assigned to the finite<br>
elements found in the searching step; and (g) displaying the results of the searching step in the<br><br>
hierarchal structure.<br>
The informational resource may be a single document, a plurality of documents or a<br>
stream of data, and the step of identifying the finite elements may include the steps of identifying<br>
sections or sub-sections within the documents) or data stream or by simply identifying the<br>
documents themselves. The step of dividing the informational resource into a plurality of finite<br>
elements is preferably performed by an expert system according to a rule set; and the step of<br>
assigning a categorical tag to each of the plurality of finite elements is also preferably performed<br>
by an expen system according to another rule set. If unsatisfactory results are obtained in step<br>
(g) above, one or both of the rule sets may be modified by the end user and the steps (a) through<br>
(g) may be performed again.<br>
Each database record preferably includes an address or pointer to the corresponding finite<br>
element and further preferably includes all of the non-common strings (e.g., words or phrases)<br>
contained within the corresponding finite element along with the frequency that such strings<br>
appear.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method for retrieving information from an<br>
informational resource includes the steps of: defining a first rule set for dividing the<br>
informational resource into a plurality of finite elements; utilizing the first rule set. dividing the<br>
informational resource into a plurality of finite elements; defining a second rule set for creating a<br>
categorical tag for one of the plurality of finite elements; utilizing the second rule set to create a<br>
categorical tag for each of the plurality of finite elements; generating a searchable database<br>
including a searchable database record for each of the finite elements; searching the searchable<br>
database for relevant database records; associating the relevant database records found in the<br>
search with corresponding relevant finite elements; selecting a hierarchy for displaying<br>
identifying phrases pertaining to the relevant finite elements; ordering the relevant finite<br>
elements in the hierarchy according, at least in part, to the categorical tag for each of the finite<br>
elements; and displaying the identifying phrases pertaining to the relevant finite elements<br>
according to the results of the ordering step.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a data storage device (such as a CD ROM) is<br>
provided, which comprises: an informational resource divided into a plurality of finite elements,<br>
where each of the finite elements includes a categorical tag and a database record assigned<br><br>
thereto, where the categorical tag includes data pertaining to a content of the finite element and<br>
the database record includes at least one string contained within the finite element; and also<br>
comprises software instructions programmed to retrieve and display at least a portion of the<br>
informational resource. The software instructions are configured to perform the steps of:<br>
supplying a search string, searching through the database records for relevant database records<br>
containing the search string, arranging the results of the searching step in a hierarchal structure<br>
according to the information in the categorical tags assigned to the finite elements corresponding<br>
to the relevant database records, and displaying identifying phrases for the finite elements<br>
corresponding to the relevant database records in the hierarchal structure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is an information management, retrieval and display system for<br>
searching through an informational resource, such as a document (e.g., a treaty), a number of<br>
individual documents (e.g., Web pages resident on the Internet), or a stream of information (e.g.,<br>
DNA code, source code, satellite data transmissions, etc.) and for displaying the results of the<br>
search in an collapsible/expandable format based upon a user-selected display criteria or<br><br>
hierarchy. Such a display hierarchy will allow the end-user to effectively and quickly obtain<br>
items of interest from the search results.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, in a first embodiment of the invention, the information management,<br>
retrieval and display system includes four primary modules, a break module 10, an indexing<br>
module 12, a search module 14 and an un-break module 16. Each of these processing modules<br>
are preferably expert engines operating upon a set of expert rules that define the operation of the<br>
individual module. As will be described in further detail below, the expert rules for these<br>
modules are preferably generated by a person or persons having intimate knowledge of the<br>
document or documents 18 being searched; and the fine tuning of the expert rules is a iterative<br>
process where the expert will modify or change the rules of one or more of the above modules if<br>
a search through the document or documents proves to be unsatisfactory.<br>
The break module 10 parses through an informational resource, such as a group of<br>
documents 18 to break up the group of documents into "finite elements" 20a-20z. Each finite<br>
element is a user-defined "basket" of information from documents that is to be individually<br>
indexed and searched. The finite element is usually not a single word, phrase or symbol, but is a<br>
section or portion of an informational resource that can be identified and isolated by the break<br>
module. A simple example of a finite element would be the individual paragraphs of a<br>
document. Other examples of finite elements would include sub-chapters of a document,<br>
individual pages of a document, and other types of identifiable sections of a document. In some<br>
instances, the finite element can be the entire document itself. The break module is also<br>
responsible for analyzing the contents of each finite element 20a-20z and creating a categorical<br>
tag 22a-22z for each finite element, which is to be inserted into the finite element. The<br>
categorical tags 22a-22z may include a standard classification based upon the content analysis<br>
such as, for example, a "Dewey Decimal" type number, or some other categorical reference<br>
number. The categorical tag may also include an organizational attribute such as pertaining to<br>
the type of finite element or the location of the finite element within the document, a date stamp,<br>
a categorical word or phrase summarizing the contents of the finite element, etc. As will be<br>
discussed in detail below, the contents of each categorical tag provides information to the search<br>
module 12 so as to assist the search module in creating the hierarchical display of the search<br>
results.<br><br>
The index module parses through each of the finite elements created by the break module<br>
and creates a searchable database 23 including a database record 24a-24z for each of the finite<br>
elements created by the break module. The searchable database 23 is a type of reverse index,<br>
where each record 24a-24z includes an address or location of the corresponding finite element<br>
and all words contained within the finite element (preferably excluding common words such as<br>
"and," "in," "the," ... ) along with their frequency of appearance within the finite element (i.e.,<br>
their weight).<br>
At some point during the process, a user, which may be an end user or may be the expert<br>
developing the rule sets, will enter a search query 26 and an optional hierarchical selection 28.<br>
The search query may be any conventional search query as available to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art and may include search words or phrases and/or operators tying the words together. The<br>
hierarchy selection informs the search module the type of display format that the user wishes to<br>
see the results displayed within. Specifically, the hierarchy selection will inform the search<br>
module whether or not the search results are to be displayed in an order or structure based<br>
entirely upon the information contained within the categorical tags (research-centric), if the<br>
search results are to be displayed in an order depending entirely upon the frequency of the key<br>
words or phrases present within the finite elements (conventional), or if the search results are to<br>
be displayed in an order or structure based upon a combination of the two (document-centric).<br>
The search module will utilize the search query to search through the database records<br>
24a-24z so as to find the database records 30 matching the words or phrases in the search query.<br>
The search module will then, depending upon the selected hierarchy 28, display the search results<br>
32 in an order or collapsible/expandable tree structure based upon information from the<br>
categorical tags 22 included in the finite elements 20 that are associated with the records 30<br>
matching the search query. For example, a first level of the display hierarchy might be ordered<br>
according to the chapters of a document that the finite elements are contained within.<br>
Information regarding the chapters that the finite elements are contained within will be resident<br>
within the categorical tags associated with the finite elements. A second level of the display<br>
results may order the finite elements for each chapter based upon the weight or frequency that the<br>
search words or phrases appear within each finite element. Therefore, on the search results<br>
screen the end user will select which chapter he or she would like to view a relevant finite<br><br>
element from and the display will then expand to show the finite elements from that chapter<br>
matching the search query. These finite elements contained within this chapter will be ordered<br>
depending upon the weight of the search query or words. From there, the user will make a<br>
selection 34 indicating to the un-break module 16 which of the finite elements the user wishes to<br>
view.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the different combinations<br>
of ordering schemes and tiers for any given hierarchy is virtually limitless. Other examples of<br>
ordering schemes and tiers can be based upon the topic of the finite element, the author or<br>
provider of the finite element, the time/date of the finite element, the position of the finite<br>
element with respect to the information resource, etc. It is also within the scope of the invention<br>
that the hierarchy only include one tier or level of ordering.<br>
While it is preferred that the search module displays the search results in an<br>
collapsible/expandible tree structure, it is also within the scope of the invention that the display<br>
results be displayed in alternate hierarchal or tiered structures. An example of an alternate<br>
hierarchal/tiered structure is the use of a cascaded or tiled display to present the various levels of<br>
the hierarchy. Of course, if there is only one tier or level of ordering, the display structure would<br>
not need to be collapsible/expandible.<br>
The search module may also be configured to recognize that a string in the search query<br>
may have other permeations, which may be used by the search engine to provide matches with<br>
the database records. For example, if the search query includes a word in a first language, it is<br>
within the scope of the invention for the search module to provide the word in other languages<br>
when looking for matches with the database records. Likewise, it is within the scope of the<br>
invention for the search module to provide other known forms or tenses of the word; and it is<br>
also within the scope of the invention for the search module to provide other search words having<br>
a similar or the same meaning.<br>
The un-break module 16 accesses the categorical tag of the selected finite element 34 to<br>
determine the other finite elements 36 of the documents 18 that are to be grouped together so as<br>
to form the single contiguous display 38. For example, if the selected finite element 34 is a<br>
paragraph of the document, the un-break module 16 will refer to the categorical tags of the<br>
remaining finite elements to determine the other finite elements 36 that appear on the same page<br><br>
as the selected finite element so as to display the entire page 38 rather than the single paragraph.<br>
Likewise, the un-break module can group related finite elements together in a contiguous<br>
chapter, section, or other contiguous identifiable portion of the document or documents. Simply<br>
put, the-un-break module is used for displaying the selected finite element in context with the<br>
remaining portions of the informational resource.<br>
While it is preferred that the un-break module is utilized to reconstruct contiguous<br>
portions of the informational resource, it is within the scope of the invention to configure the<br>
expert rule sets of the un-break module to construct new informational resources using the<br>
selected finite elements and other finite elements from the original informational resource. For<br>
example, the un-break module may be configured to compile all of the finite elements matching<br>
the search query into a new informational resource, using the categorical tags for these finite<br>
elements to dictate the order in which the finite elements will be compiled. In another example,<br>
the un-break module may be configured to review the categorical tag of the selected finite<br>
element to determine other finite elements that are related to the selected finite element based on<br>
the date that the finite elements were created, or the author/owner of the finite element, or the<br>
content of the finite element; and the un-break module will then construct a new informational<br>
resource compiling all of the related finite elements.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B provide a flow chart representation of an operation of the information<br>
management, retrieval and display system for the embodiment described above. As shown in<br>
functional block 40, a first step is to access the informational resource being examined. As<br>
illustrated in functional block 42, the next step is to select the appropriate expert rule sets to<br>
apply for searching through the informational resource. The particular rule set selected will<br>
depend upon the type of information resource that was accessed in step 40. For example, a set of<br>
expert rule sets used for searching through and analyzing the Antarctic Treaty will be different<br>
than a set of rule sets used for analyzing and searching through volume 37 of the Code of Federal<br>
Regulations. As shown in functional block 44, the next step is to break the information resource<br>
into a plurality of finite elements according to a first set of the expert systems rules. As<br>
discussed above, this step involves breaking the informational resource into identifiable<br>
segments of information such as paragraphs, subsections, pages, chapters, subchapters and the<br>
like. An example rule set for breaking the Antarctic Treaty into a plurality of finite elements is<br><br>
provided below in Table 1.<br><br>
As shown in the above table, the example rule set is adapted to divide the Antarctic<br>
Treaty into a plurality of levels where a primary level of the Treaty, which involves the Antarctic<br>
Treaty, Conventions, Protocol and its Annexes, is recognized by the search engine by identifying<br>
bold, large font centered on a page. A secondary level, which are the Recommendations and<br>
Measures contained within the Treaty, are recognized by the search engine by identifying Roman<br>
numerals. A tertiary level is utilized to divide up the primary and secondary levels into smaller<br>
finite elements. This tertiary level of finite elements is recognized by the search engine by<br>
identifying medium fonts centered on a page with a colon. The remaining levels of the table<br>
should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon analyzing the table and the associated<br>
pattern matching rules.<br><br>
Accordingly, the purpose of the above rule set is to create an automatic tool for matching<br>
patterns that distinguish hierarchies, segments or elements within any type of informational<br>
resource. The rule set is developed in relation to user-defined requirements for the segments or<br>
elements that need to be indexed and searched within the informational resource. It will also be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the rule sets will be greatly simplified in<br>
informational resources that include already distinguished segments or elements, such as in<br>
separate columns or blocks. Preferably, the rule sets are designed by an expert having intimate<br>
knowledge of the informational resource, in an iterative manner utilizing feed-back loops as will<br>
be described below.<br>
As shown in functional block 46, a next step is to create a categorical tag for each of the<br>
finite elements based upon a positional and/or content analysis of the finite element according to<br>
a second set of expert system rules. An example of a rule set for defining categorical tags for<br>
finite elements extracted from the Antarctic Treaty is provided below in Table 2.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the categorical tag will include notation indicating the finite<br>
element's position within each of the various identified levels of the Antarctic Treaty. For<br>
example, the categorical tag will include information indicating if on a primary level, the finite<br>
element is contained within the Antarctic Treaty, the Conventions, the Protocol or its Annexes.<br>
On a secondary level, the categorical tag will indicate whether or not the finite element is<br>
included in the Recommendations, Measures, etc. As shown in the bottom of the table, the<br>
categorical tag for each of the finite elements will also include a content base notation indicating<br>
the year that the particular section or finite element was created. Of course, the type and<br>
variations of positional and/or content base notations included in the categorical tags are virtually<br>
limitless. For example, the rule set may be configured to analyze the contents of the finite<br>
element so as to provide a categorical word or phrase which provides a clue to the user as to the<br>
contents of the finite element. Similarly, rather than utilizing a word or phrase, the rule set can<br>
analyze the contents or position of the finite element to provide a categorical reference number to<br>
the finite element, such as a Dewey Decimal type number.<br>
As shown in functional step 48, a next step is to insert the categorical tag created above in<br>
step 46 into the finite element created in step 44. As shown in functional block 50, a next step is<br>
to generate, for each of the finite elements, a searchable database record. Each database record<br>
preferably contains the noncommon strings (e.g., words, phrases, symbols) contained within the<br>
finite element along with their frequency (i.e., weight). Furthermore, each database record will<br>
include an address, location or link to the corresponding finite element. As shown in functional<br>
block 52, a next step is to enter a search string such as a word, phrase or symbol(s) and to select a<br>
display hierarchy. As shown in functional block 54, a next step is to search through the database<br>
records created in functional block 50 for matches between the search string and the noncommon<br>
strings of the database records. This searching step will identify the relevant database records<br>
having noncommon strings matching the search string. As shown in functional block 56, the<br>
relevant database records found in the searching step 54 will be ordered by applying information<br>
from each of the categorical tags of the relevant database record's associated finite element to the<br>
selected display hierarchy and/or by applying the weight of the matching search strings in the<br>
relevant database records to the selected display hierarchy.<br>
For example, a first level of the display hierarchy for the Antarctic Treaty might be the<br><br>
year that the finite element was created; the second level might be ordered according to the order<br>
of the Articles of the Antarctic Treaty; and a third level of the display hierarchy might be ordered<br>
according to the weight of the matching strings contained within the database records.<br>
As shown in functional block 58, a next step would be to display the search results in the<br>
collapsible/expandable hierarchy on a display screen. As shown in functional block 60, the user<br>
will determine whether the search results were satisfactory, and if not the process will advance to<br>
functional block 62 where the user will modify one or more of the rule sets and will return either<br>
to functional block 44 or to functional block 52 depending upon which rule sets have been<br>
modified.<br>
If, in functional block 60, the search results are satisfactory, the process will advance to<br>
functional block 64 where the user will select one of the finite elements from the search results<br>
display. Then in functional block 66, the categorical tag of the selected finite element will be<br>
used to identify other finite elements that are to be grouped together with the selected finite<br>
element to create a contiguous portion of the informational research to be displayed. Finally, in<br>
functional block 68, the contiguous portion of the informational resource will be displayed on the<br>
display screen or printed.<br>
It is envisioned that an expert having intimate knowledge of the informational resource<br>
will develop the rule sets based upon his or her knowledge of the informational resource.<br>
Thereafter, once the rule sets have been fully developed, the feed-back portion of the above-<br>
described flow chart will no longer be necessary.<br>
Furthermore, once the rule sets have been fully developed, the search module, the un-<br>
break module and the fully developed rule sets may be incorporated onto a data storage device<br>
(such as a CD ROM, a disk-drive, a floppy-disk and the like) along with an informational<br>
resource pre-broken into its plurality of finite elements, where each of the finite elements<br>
includes the corresponding categorical tag previously created therefore, along with the pre-<br>
created searchable database for the plurality of finite elements. Therefore, such a storage device<br>
would essentially provide a searchable document that includes the entire content of the<br>
informational resource along with a search engine that has been fined tuned by an expert with<br>
intimate knowledge of the informational resource, so that end users of the CD ROM (or other<br>
type of storage device) would be able to take advantage of the expert's knowledge and<br><br>
experience in searching through the informational resource contained therewith.<br>
As shown on Fig. 3, a flow chart representation of an embodiment of the invention<br>
resident on a data storage device, such as a CD ROM, is presented. Essentially, this embodiment<br>
is equivalent to the embodiment described in Figs. 2A and 2B above, except that the<br>
development of the rule sets are not longer required. As shown in functional block 52'. a first<br>
step would be for the end user to enter a search string and select a display hierarchy. In<br>
functional block 54', the next step would be for the search module to search through the database<br>
records contained on or downloaded from the CD ROM to match the search string with the non-<br>
common strings contained in the searchable database records. As shown in functional block 56'<br>
the next step would be for the search module to order the search results by applying information<br>
in the categorical tags of the matching finite elements (which are contained in, or are downloaded<br>
from the CD ROM) and/or by applying the weight of the matching strings to the selected display<br>
hierarchy as discussed above. As shown in functional block 58' the next step is to display the<br>
search results in preferably a collapsible/expandable hierarchy. As shown in functional block<br>
60', the end user, upon viewing the search results will determine whether or not the results are<br>
satisfactory'. If not satisfactory, the process will return to functional block 52' where the end user<br>
will input a new search string and/or will select a new display hierarchy. If the display results of<br>
step 58' are satisfactory, the process will advance to functional block 64' where the end user will<br>
select one of the finite elements from the search results display. Advancing to functional block<br>
66' the un-break module will reconstruct the portion of the information resource that includes the<br>
selected finite element by accessing the selected finite element and the other surrounding or<br>
related finite elements from the CD ROM to create the contiguous portion of the informational<br>
resource that included the finite element.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the information management, retrieval<br>
and display system may be specifically configured to search through a number of individual Web<br>
pages resident on the Internet and to display the results of the search in an collapsible/expandable<br>
format based upon a user selected display criteria or hierarchy. In such an embodiment, a break<br>
module in the form described above may not be necessary because each Web page may already<br>
be considered a "finite element" and the search engines will not be able to modify the Web<br>
pages. Therefore, with such an embodiment, the search engine will also not be able to insert the<br><br>
categorical into the finite elements. Therefore, in this embodiment, the categorical tags may be<br>
either stored separately from the finite elements or incorporated directly into the database<br>
records. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the Web page creators may desire to create their own<br>
categorical tags for their Web pages rather than having the search engine create one for them.<br>
With this feature, the Web page designer may be able to influence the search results, perhaps to<br>
achieve a more accurate description of his or her Web site. Of course, in such a feature may also<br>
be used by the Web designers in a deceptive manner, where the categorical tag will cause the<br>
Web page to be listed in search results when the searcher is looking for an entirely different type<br>
of information. Recognizing this potential problem, the index module may include an option<br>
where it will compare the actual contents of the Web page against the embedded categorical tags<br>
inserted by the Web page designer, and may create a new categorical tag to be inserted in the<br>
database record for the Web page if there is a significant difference between the two. Likewise,<br>
the search engine can be configured to include an optional filter that will filter out Web sites<br>
having unsavory contents as indicated by the embedded categorical tags or as determined upon a<br>
review of the content of the Web page itself.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in such an embodiment of the invention, the information<br>
management, retrieval and display system includes two primary modules, an index module 70<br>
and a search module 72. Each of these processing modules are preferably expert engines<br>
operating upon a set of expert rules that define the operation of the individual module. The index<br>
module 70 will periodically crawl through the volume of Web pages 74 utilizing a conventional<br>
Web crawling or Web searching technology such as a spider technology, which is adapted to<br>
examine each Web page (or as many as possible) provided on the Internet. As shown in Fig. 4,<br>
several of the Web pages may include a predefined, embedded categorical tag 76 included<br>
therewith. As discussed above, such an embedded tag 76 would be inserted in the Web page by<br>
the Web page designer so that the search engine of Fig. 4 would utilize this predefined embedded<br>
categorical tag rather than creating one on its own. An example of a rule from the expert rule set<br>
for defining the categorical tag in this embodiment would be to identify the most prominent word<br>
or phrase on the initial screen appearing when the Web site is accessed.<br>
The index module 70 will also create a searchable database 78 including a database<br>
record 80a-80z for each of the Web pages accessed above. This searchable database 78 is a type<br><br>
of reverse index or each record 80a-80z includes a link to a corresponding Web page, all words<br>
contained within the Web page (preferably excluding common words) along with their frequency<br>
of appearance within the Web page, and a categorical tag created by the index module or a copy<br>
of the categorical tag that was included in the particular Web page as described above. It is<br>
envisioned that the index module would constantly be re-accessing the Web pages 74 and<br>
updating the searchable database 78, since the contents of Web pages are also constantly being<br>
updated or changed.<br>
When a user wishes to conduct a search using the search engine, the user will enter a<br>
search query 82 and select an optional hierarchical selection 84. The search query may be any<br>
conventional search query as available to those or ordinary skill in the art, it may include a search<br>
word or phrases and/or operators tying the words together. The hierarchy selection informs the<br>
search module the type of display format that the user wishes to see the results displayed within.<br>
Specifically, the hierarchy selection will inform the search module whether or not the search<br>
results are to be displayed in an order or structure based entirely upon the information contained<br>
within the categorical tags (research-centric), if the search results are to be displayed in an order<br>
depending entirely on the frequency of the key words or phrases present within the finite<br>
elements (conventional), or if the search results are to be displayed in an order or structure based<br>
upon a combination of the two (document-centric).<br>
The search module 72 utilizing a search query 82 to search through the database records<br>
80a-80z so as to find the database records 86 matching the words or phrases in the search query.<br>
The search module will then, depending upon the selected hierarchy 84, display the search results<br>
88 in an order or in a collapsible/expandable tree structure based upon information from the<br>
categorical tags 89 included within the database records 87 matching the search query. From the<br>
display 88, the user will make a selection 90 of a link to a Web page that he or she wishes to<br>
view and the search module will then display the Web page 92 on the display screen.<br>
Figs. 5 A and 5B provides a flow chart representation of an operation of the embodiment<br>
described above in Fig. 4. As illustrated in the function block 94, a first step is to access a Web<br>
page on the Internet. In functional block 96, the next step is to determine whether the access<br>
Web pages includes an embedded categorical tag. If the Web page includes an embedded<br>
categorical tag the process would advance to functional block 98 where the process will<br><br>
determine whether the embedded categorical tag is consistent with the content of the Web page.<br>
If the Web page does not include an embedded categorical tag or if the categorical tag is not<br>
consistent with the content of the Web page, the process will advance to functional block 100<br>
where a categorical tag will be created for the Web page. If the embedded categorical tag is<br>
consistent with the content of the Web page in step 98 or if the categorical tag is created for the<br>
Web page in step 100, the process will advance to functional block 102 where a searchable<br>
database record will be generated for the Web page. This searchable database record will include<br>
the non-common words or phrases contained within the Web page and their frequency (i.e.,<br>
weight) a link to the Web page and the categorical tag embedded within the Web page or created<br>
in step 100 above. The process will then advance to functional block 104 to determine whether a<br>
next Web page is to be accessed. If so, the process will return to functional block 94. If the<br>
searchable database is complete, the process will advance to functional block 106 where a user<br>
will enter a search word or phase in selected display hierarchy.<br>
Advancing the functional block 108, the search engine will search through database<br>
records for matches between the search word or phrase and the non-common word or phrases<br>
contained within the database records. Advancing to functional block 110 the search engine will<br>
then order the results of the search by applying the information in the categorical tags matching<br>
database records to the selected display hierarchy and/or by applying the weight of the search<br>
word or phrase in each of the matching database records to the selected display hierarchy.<br>
Advancing to functional block 112, the next step would involve displaying the search results on<br>
the display screen. In functional block 114, if the search results are satisfactory, the user will<br>
select a Web page link on the display screen and the search engine will display the associated<br>
Web page selected. If the search results are unsatisfactory, the process will advance to functional<br>
block 118 where the user will enter a new search word or phrase and/or select a new display<br>
hierarchy and the process will return to functional block 108 so that another search can be<br>
performed.<br>
In the present embodiment, the expert rule sets for creating the categorical tags, and the<br>
database records may be defined by an expert utilizing an iterative variation of the above process<br>
on a limited portion of the Internet (similar to that as described in Figs 2 A and 2B above). Once<br>
the rule sets have been refined, the rule sets can be applied to the entire Internet. The above<br><br>
described search engine can be operating on a Web site or may be contained in a memory device<br>
such as a CD ROM which can be downloaded onto a computer having access to the Internet.<br>
The following Appendix provides example code segments for dividing the Antarctic<br>
Treaty into a plurality of finite elements and for creating categorical tags for the finite elements.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Then, when the Dewey tag is written out, the Year is placed in the appropriate position, whether it be the<br>
first, second, or third level using the Roman Numeral from the currently matched pattern to obtain the correct Year<br>
from the hashtable (YearTrans table specifically) as generated above.<br><br><br><br>
