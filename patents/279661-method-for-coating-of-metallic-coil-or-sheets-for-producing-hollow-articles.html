Method for coating of metallic coil or sheets for producing hollow articles<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention concerns a method for coating of a metallic coii or of metallic sheets with a composition for treatment or pre-treatment whereby the such treated metallic material is further on shaped to an article like a container or a casing, especially to a can, and then cleaned and optionally further either chemi¬cally pre-treated and then coated with ink or paint or chemtcaily treated, in the following, the production line of a two-pieces aluminum can is selected to dem¬onstrate on the one side the conventional process of today and on the other side a process according to the invention.<br>
in today can production, an aluminum can plant buys aluminum colls at an alu¬minum coil mill having an aluminum cold rolling facility. The aluminum coii stock is typically of a specific alloy type which is used in many can plants. These alu¬minum oolls are then sent to the can plant having a so called post-lube applied on the surface. The post-lube Is an oil or an ester based composition, typically having a considerable amount of vegetable oi! or mineral oil or both. The post-lube aids in the corrosion protection of the metallic materlal.<br>
The aluminum alloy ooil used for the can production is often rolled down to a vrall thickness in the range from 0,45 to 0.25 mm at the aluminum mill, vyhereas a wall thickness e.g. of 0.: mm is reduced during the shaping process at the can plant to a wail thiclmess e.g. of Q.10 mm, often in about 4 or 5 process steps in a body-maker.<br>
First, at the front end of the can plant, the coil, which carris typically an oiJ con-     taining post-lube upon its surfaces, is hold in an uncoiler for unwrapping the coii.<br>
Then, a lubricant composition is applied which may contain ail, ester(s), emulsi-fler(s) or water or any combination thereof upon the coll e.g. with the aid of a<br>
 <br>
spray nozzle. It may be called "post-ube" too and may be of the same or of a similar composition compared with the first post-lube. This lubricant composition is applied to the coil, which is then used for aiding in the shaping of the can, typically just before or in the "oup-maker' or both. After the cup-maker has pro¬duced pre-formed cans called "cups", the cups are transported to a so called body-maker machine ("body-maker").<br>
The body-maker typically uses a composition which contains oil, emulslfi6r(s), ester(s), coolant(s) or any combination thereof for the further shaping and the coollrtg of the tools artd the shaped component. This equipment shapes the cups by a drawing and wall ironing procsss to the final shape and to the final surface quality of the surfaces as it is well-lcnown e.g. as a beer can or as a coke can. The drawing and the wail ironing process or similar shaping processes cause so much force onto the aluminum materia! that the aluminum alloy in the tools flows like in a coldforming operation, After the shape of the so-called "body" Is generated, the top of the drawn cup is cut {"trimmed" in a "trimmer"), and the cans are transported to the so-calied "washer" having several baths where in today processes, in different process steps dsaning is performed and where typically different chemicals are applied in different baths. In between and optionally at the end of the washer too, there is at least one water rinsing.<br>
Aluminum cans are today produced at a speed of 1000 to 4000 can units per minute in one line, which are often drawn and wall ironed by up to 10 parallel body-makers, but often only drawn to cups by only 1 cup-maker before in this line.<br>
Thstypical (pre-) treatment process In a can washer may often comprise the following stages:<br>
1.	Pre-rtnsing - stage 0<br>
2.	Pre-cleaning - stage 1<br>
 <br>
3.	Acidic cleaning - stage 2<br>
4.	Rinsing A/B - stage 3a<br>
5.	Dome stain (pre-) tremant - stage 4<br>
S.	Rinsing A/B - stage 5<br>
7.	DI rinsing - stage 6 (deionised, often even reoycied, water)<br>
8.	Mobility Enhancer - stage 7.<br>
The can bodies coming from the body-maler typloally have very smooth outer surfaces, but need to be cleaned. Gardobond* S 5240 und Gardobond  4S CR of Chemetail GmbH may be used in the (pre-)oleaning stages to get rid of oil, dirt and other contaminants like the burnt oil and other burnt organic compo¬nents which may cause the can body to iook blade and to remove thereby the content of post-lube, of cupping lube and of body-makkcer coolant/iube. Such aqueous acidic cleaning composfUons may contain fnse fluonde or Fe"" together with at least one oxidizing agent like a peroxide. But the longer or the stronger the etching in the acidic bath is, the rougher the can body may become. The color of the can body may even turn to white, if there is a too strong etching. And the can body has to be rejected too, if ft has a very high friction. The can bodies cannot be transported in an adequate way without having applied a mobility en¬hancer if they show a. certain roughness. By lowering the etching rate, there is less or no need for applying a mobility enhancer,<br>
Then the can may be (pre-) treated with an aqueous composition for a conver¬sion coating typically based on Zr, F and PO4, e.g. with the product Gardobond® 1450 N or Gardobond 764 of Chemeteili GmbH or with Alsurf 450 of Nippon Paint Corp. in the so-called "stage 4 process" or "dome stain treatment" of the washer so that the bottom (dome) of the can is protected during the pasteuriza¬tion against corrosion as the pasteurization is often necessary especially for beer<br>
 <br>
cans, This dome stain treatment typically leads to a zirconium containing coating having a zirconium content to be msasured as elemental zln:onium In the range from 2 io14 mg/m 2r. The application of such compositions in a can washer is a difficult process due to the limited stabilit/ of the system and due to the sludge generation. The generated coating often affects the mobility of the cans. The mobility of the cans Which stand and roll one parallel to the other standing on a transportation (aelt or or a transportation mat is significantly influenced by the gliding properties of the can surfaces and of the coatings on the can bodies. The mobility is directly related to production speed In the can plant. The higher the mobility is, the higher may be the producfion speed and ttie production capacity.<br>
By applying a so-called "mobility enhancer" to the can body especially In stage 7 of the washer, e.g. ah aqueous composition on the be of a mixture of surfac¬tants In aqueous solution, the gliding ability of the mostly rough surface of the can body is improved.<br>
Th© cans may be shipped to a brewery, where e.g. beer may be pasteurized ei¬ther prior to filling it into the cans or after having flilad it into the cans, in the iast case, especially the not further treated outer surface of the dome may underlie corrosion e.g. by faiacitenlng if there is an insufficient corrosicn protection. The pasteurizing is often conducted With hot water of about 75 to 95 °C. At this tem¬perature, the dome would become white to grayish and sometimes even black because of the start of comosion at the metallic surface if it is not corrosion pro¬tected. Therefore, a protection of the dome outside surface is important as only the other outer surfaces as well as to the inner surfaces independent one from the other are painted or printed with ink or paint or both. Such a color change has to be avcHded.<br>
We have found that the oonterrt of phosphoric acid of a typical coi<e may corrode the wail of a typical aluminum can in about hours if there is no inside corrosion protection. therefore even breakings and cracks metallic material></e>
 <br>
its coatings should be reduced or even avoided to minimize fine risic of corroding such cans not only on the inner surface, but even to avoid crevice corrosion.<br>
This conventional process in a can waslner often slnovvs the following disadvan¬tages:<br>
The succession of bafiis and (pre-) treatmants of tlie can bodies in the washer Is complex and difficult, and it is a sensitive system, even in relation to the shap¬ing operations before. The most disadvantageous effeds are related to tfie dome stain (pre-) treatment and to the mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment.<br>
1.) The dome stain (pre-) treatment is often disadvantageous because of:<br>
a)	The effect of reducing the glidability of the can bodies because of the perhaps more or less crystalline and typically relatively rough coating generated with the dome stain composition.<br>
b)	The loss of paint adhesion In the necking area of the can bodies, which is nearby to the area where the lid will be joined to, as the more or less crystalline dome stain coating is not nexlble enough to be significantly bent in the necking area and causes micro-cracks and fractures during bending which causes mi¬cro-cracks and fractures of the paint layer applied upon the dome stain coating too whereby the micro-cracks and fractures occur primarily in the segments of convexly Ijent outer regions, especially if they are coated with a highly pigmented ink or highly pigmented paint or both, w/hereby white bare rust may later occur; therefore, it would be a great advantage to avoid this failure t'pe.<br>
c)	The temperature of the dome stain (pre-) treatment bath Is often In the range from 35 to 60 "C which is expensive.<br>
d)	Ttie costs of the chemicals In the dome stain (pre-) treatment,<br>
e)	Sludge generation, which causes pauses for cleaning the baths during which there is no production in the line.<br>
 <br>
f)	The disposal of waste water, chemicals and sludge.<br>
g)	In the bath for a dome stain (pre-) treatment only a very low sulfur content is<br>
acceptable, but easily a certain sulfur content of the acidic cleaning bath may be<br>
introduced: If a body is standing upwards and not downwards, which occurs in<br>
some situations, such upstanding can body in stage 4 introduces sulfuric acid<br>
and other acids from the acidic cleaning solution into the bath of stage 4, which<br>
should therefore have a continuous overflow ar»d s loss of chemicals 1o ensure a<br>
ver tow sulfur content In the bath.<br>
h) The (pre-) treatment time to be used is only very few seconds for one can body, but if the can transportation speed is reduced or if there occurs a line stop, the dome stain coating has more time to develop and is therefore thiokar and rougher, Then the gfidability of this coating is significantly reduced.<br>
Therefore, it would be a significant advantage to avoid a dome stain (pre-) treat¬ment or tc use a dome stain (pre-) treatment which does not generate a rough crystalline coating like coatings on the base of at least one phosphonate as it is possible to use so-called "self-assembling molecules" (SAM) on the base of at least one compound selected from the group of phosphonic acids, phospho-nates and their derivatives and/or to use a dome stain (pre-) treatment vs/ith less environmentally unfriendly consequences.<br>
A mobility enhancer shall create a well glldable coating on the surfiace of the can body, so that a more or less rough surface is flattened and made better glldable than without such coating.<br>
2.) The use of a mobility enhancer is often disadvantageous because of;<br>
a) The mobility enhancer composition - in the following called "mobility enhan¬cer" ~ is today often an aqueous compasition on the base of surfactants or es¬ters or both. The higher the concentration of the mobility enhancer is or the longer It Is applied e.g. during a line stop, problems may occur in painting or<br>
 <br>
printing the can aftenvards: The more hydroptiilic the surface coated with tlie mobility enhancer Is, the easier may occur wetting probJems, if an ini<: or a paint is used which more tiydrophobic as the typically paints inks both for outer surfaces of can an article are hydrophobic. there may then problem occur because insufficient adherence to surface. but does not inner surfeces car often hydrophilic ink></:>
b) There may occur a dirt from a mobility enhancer which may cause a type of failure called "salt rings" which may be caused by a too high concentration of a mobility enhancer bath, especially ooouning when a high mobility enhancer con¬centration is applied to the standing can body, when the mobility enhancer forms a liquid film ring at the bottom and dries on, Such salt rings are a reason for re-jecstion of the such coated shaped bodies.<br>
The percentage of rejections because of the dome stain (pre-) treatment and of the mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment may be at least 0,1 % of the whole can production, perhaps even sometimes mors than 1 %, which is a high cost factor in such a mass production. These two production stages seem to be typically the stages with the highest failure rates. One can production line only may have costs because of the rejection of cans in the range of vaguely half a million € per year.<br>
It is therefore an object of the Invention to propose an easier or sheaper method for producing hollow articles like cans and casings. It is another object of the invention to propose a method for producing hollow articles like cans and cas¬ings in a less complex, less Instable or shorter process succession.<br>
We have now found that there may often occur miCTo-craoks In the aluminum alloy of cans at the dome outside surface, which seem to arise from the shaping in the body-maker, Suoh cra.eks may hold oil inside, as the capillary forces are<br>
 <br>
very strong, even despite heating and high spray pressures. The oil may remain in the micro-oraci<s. so that the oii may spread out of micro-cracks if can is heated as inside not yet painted. later-on applied water-based paint then able to cover small covered areas surface. there tg no and at these flaws corrosion protec therefore it preferred optimise shaping process even reduce numbers size during steps.></s.>
WB have now found that there are several advarftages if the shaped can body is not coated with the specific chemicals of the "stage 4 pnuoess" conventionally used today on the base of Zr, F and PO in stage 4 of the washer, but Jf the metallic coil or the metallic sheets are already coated before.<br>
We have now found that at least a part of the corftsnt of zirconium applied in a zirconium rich coating on coil may remain on the surface or in the surface layer or both of the metallic material during the shaping and even during ttie cleaning after the shaping, which is very astonishing.<br>
V\/6 have now found that a can may he pnsduced with a perfect dome stain resis¬tance viflthout using the conventional "stage 7 process" with a mobility enhancer, If a metallic coil or if metallic sheets are precoated with an adequate corrosion resistant coating. This stag© may be therefore omitted or may b&gt;e replaced e.g. by a rinsing stage with water or with water having a low surfactant(s)' content. Such an omission is only possible if the metallic material stock: had shown an adequate coating before the shaping which remains during the process at least partially on the metallic surface or leads to a modified metallic surface or both.<br>
An investigation revealed that arconium is present at the surface of a can body, although no dome stain (pre-) treatment or no other zirconium containing com¬position had been applied in the washer.<br>
It was astonishing that the zirconium content of the zirconium containing pas¬sivation layer present on the metallic coil or on the metallic sheets tested was not<br>
 <br>
totally removed In the shaping and In the thereon follow/ing cleaning process. Therefore, it is believed that the zirconium content of this coating \was trans¬formed into the surface of the aluminum alloy during the shaping especially dur¬ing the drawing and wall ironing steps in the body-makers, especially due to the high pressure and perhaps due to the high temperatures present during shap¬ing.<br>
We have found that the coating applied on the metallic surface is able to aid in the shaping process of the metallic coll or metallic sheets as well as in the fur¬ther shaping of the pre-shaped bodies like cups and (can) bodies, especially (n the cup-malter or in the body-maker or both of a can manufacturer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns a method for coating of a mstallic coil or of metallic sheets with an aqueous coating composition comprising at least one compound selected from the group consisting of zirconium compounds, titanium com¬pounds and hafnium compounds whereby the such treated metallic c«i or me¬tallic sheets isygre shaped by cold extruding, by deep-drawing, by drawing, by necking, by punching, by wall ironing or by any combination of such pnacess steps to a hollow article like a container or a casing and is then cleaned and op¬tionally further coated either by chemical pre-treatment and then by coating with ink or paint or both or by chemical treatment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
If there is used a chemical "treatment", no paint and no irk are applied further on. If there Is used a chemical "pre-treatment", a paint or an ink or both are ap¬plied after the (pre-) treatment. The chemical (pre-) treatment may be in some embodiments only a cleaning or starts with a cleaning, whereby the cleaning may be an alkaline cleaning or an acidic cleaning or both one after the other.<br>
 <br>
The definition of the shaping processes liKe cold extruding, deep-drawing, draw¬ing, necldng, punching and wall ironing are to be seen to be defined In a broad manner. They as well as the tenn "shaping" Itself shall cover all cold forming processes which may be used for the shaping of metallic coil or metallic sheets io hollow articles which cause a significant flow of material inside the metallic material.<br>
In the following, the process according to the invention is and its effects are demonstrated for an aluminum can line, but similarly, c4her containers or even casings or other hollow articles may be produced in an identical or in a similar process.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the article to be produced may prefera¬bly be a can. More preferred, the can is produced as a two-piece can having a can body and a lid joined later on e.g, by adhesive bonding to complete the can, in contrast thereto, the cans for food are more often produced as three-piece cans: They are composed of a bottom, a body and a lid, and there is in many cases no drawing necessary for the shaping of the metallic conaponents.<br>
Preferably, the article is produced from a metallic coil or from metallic sheets made of aluminum, aluminum alloy or tinpiate, Nevertheless, if the materials of the metallic coil or of the metallic sheets to be shaped would show adequate ma¬terial's properties, other metallic materials e.g. like magnesium alloy, steel, zinc, zino-ooated or alloy-coated metallic material may be used, too. Especially pre¬ferred are materiaJs selected from the group consisting of the aluminum alloys 1119, 3004,3104, 5052,5154A and 5182 as well as of tinplatas. Here, often an aluminum alloy like Al 3104 is used for the production of the bodies e.g, for a two-piece can, which Is hens only used as an example for the use of the inven¬tion.<br>
The coating according to the invention may preferably be applied in a coil coating line on a metallic coil or elsevrtiere on metallic sheets. The metallic ooll or the<br>

If metaBIc sheets are coated, the liquid film applied nray be even in the range from 1 tolOO ml/m, more preferred from 2 to 76 ml/'m or 3 to 50 or 4 to 30 mt/m. The coating may perhaps be seldom applied in a rinse process, but more often In a no-rinse process, where there is rrci rinsing afterwards with wa¬ter, but where the liquid iilm is dried-on-piace on the metaliro surface. The drying is in both variations preferaisiy performed at temperatures in the range from 18 to about 100 "C PMT (peak metal temperature).<br>

The coating generated on the metallic coil or on the metallic sheets may prefera¬bly contain 1 to 50 mg/m' of zirconium measured as the element, more preferred 2 to 35 mg/m', most preferred 3 to 25 mg/m.<br>
Preferably, the surface of the metallic coll or of the metailio sheets according to the invention is coated with a coating on the base of at least one compound se¬lected from the group of zirconium compounds, titanium compounds and haf¬nium compounds vtfhich aids as a passivation layer whereby this coating may show a content of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
 <br>
at least on© type of fluorine containing anion like fluorides, hydroxides, oxides, phosphates and other compounds.<br>
In a cup forming step - v\ioh may be the first shaping step, the Viigll thickness of tine metallic coil/sheet may be reduced e.g. by about 2 to 12 % of the cup wl thickness, but in a body-maker - which may be used e.g. in a drawing and wall Ironing step which may be mentioned as "drav/n and ironed" ("D and I opera¬tion") - the DUps may have to pass e.g. 4 sets of rings pushed iy an internal punch that forces the melallic material to start flowing,<br>
In a shaping machine like a cup-maker, e.g. 24 or 3S singular cups may be shaped from the coated metallic coil or from the coated metallic sheets e.g. by punching in one punching step, which cups may be then about 0,5 to 5 cm high, for beverage cans often about 3 cm high.<br>
Then the cups may be aped further e.g. in a body-maker e.g. by punching with a punching press the cups into e.g. 4 rings one after the other whereby the diameter of each cup is significantly narrowed and whereby optionally a dome or a necking or any other specific geometry or any combination thereof may be generated. Thereby, the wall thickness of the shaped bodies may be significantly reduced, e.g. from about D.2, 0.25 or 0.3 mm down to e.g. 0.08, 0.1, D.12 or 0.15 mm. The temperature of the tool of the shaping may be e.g. in the range from 60 to 110 °C, especially in the range from 80 to 90 "C. The high forces during the shaping may lead to high temperatures of the formed cup, which may then be immediately cooled down in contact with a composition containing an oil, emuis{fier(s), ester(s), coolant(s), water or any combination thereof. This com¬position may especially be a hydroiic oil-based emulsion, whereby the content of an oil compared by Including all typical additives of euch a composition may in some cases be smaller than the content of the at least one coolant in this post-lube or coolant composition or both. In a shaping machine like a body-maker, this composition may be pressed onto the parts to ba shaped with a certain pressure like about 4 bars to cool the parts and the tools.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the coated metallic coil or the coated metallic sheets is/are shaped, wfiereby an oil oontairHng film is maintained on the coated or modified metallic surface of the coil or sheets or both during the shaping, whereby the oil contain¬ing film is hold on the metallic surface better than without any content of haf¬nium, Utanium, zirconium or any combinaHon tiiersofin the surface layer or in the coating. The composition of the oil containing film may vary significantly de¬pending on the main cajnstituents added at a further process station like a body-maker and may predominantly contain oil, estar(s) or coolant(s).<br>
Herein, the terms "bodies", "shaped bodies" and "shaped articles" shall mean th© same,<br>
There may occur a significant reduction of wear of the toots coated which show a content of hafnium, titeinium, zirconium or any combination thereof or having a coating with such a content or both.<br>
The coaling may aid in the lubrication during at least one shaping step, e.g. in fonning a cup or a body or both of a shaped article, by increasing the lubrictty by using an oil, emu)sifier(s), ester(s), ooolant(s) or any mixture thereof containing composition as fjim on the cups, bodies, shaped articles or any combination of these irt at least one shaping machine like rn the body-mai<er.></er.>
Preferably, the coated metallic coil or the coated metallic sheets is/are shaped in a cup-maker and in a body-maker.<br>
The higher the oil content of this composition is, the better may be In some em¬bodiments the punching effect, but th© better must be the cleaning afterwards in the washer. Therefore, a high oil content may be preferred.<br>
Preferably, the coating shwmg a content of hafnium, titanium, zirconium or any combination thereof is not totally removed in the shaping and in the cleaning process, but is at least partially maintained after the shaping like in a cup-maker and in a body-maker or cleaning or both and optionally during the further proc-<br>
 <br>
ess succession in the washer, either as a layer, as residues of the coating or as a modified metallic surface which has at least a minor content of the coating in¬corporated into the metsllio material or as any combination of these. The coating applied to the metallic col) or to the metallic sheets may give the hollow article produced a layer or a modified metallic surface or both that may aid to resist or resists to corrosion in a process like the pasteurisation e.g. of food, beverage, etc.. especially in the region of a dome.<br>
In many embodiments, as it looks iike, at least a part of the zirconium, titanium, hafnium or any combination thereof as present in the corresponding oonnpounds is incorporated into the surface of the metallic material during the shaping, whereby a modified surface is generated.<br>
Preferably, the coated metallic coil or the coated metallic sheets is/are shaped in such \Aray, that the hafnium, titanium, zirconium or any combination thereof from the con-esponding compounds present is at least partially taken from the coating into the metallic material, whereby at least a part of the metallic surface is modi¬fied.<br>
Hereby, a surface layer which may show a continuous transition to the Inner or to the other parts of the metallic material may In some cases b© generated which is modified In comparison to the original metallic material. But it may occur, that the modified material Is even bcated in thin zones in the inner parts of the metal¬lic material by the way of shaplng.<br>
Preferabiy, the coated metallic coll or the coated metallic sheets is/are shaped in away, that the coating containing at least one compound selected from the group of arconium compounds, titanium compounds, hafnium compounds or any combination thereof or Its constituents is/are at least partially Incorporated into the metallic material during the shaping, especially into a surface near re¬gion of the metallic material. Nevertheless, it may occur that at least a minor part<br>
 <br>
of the coating like residues Is maintained as a layer on tiis siiaped metallic coil or shaped nfietallic sheets.<br>
It is supposed that a content of zirconium, titanium, hafnium or any combination thereof at the surface or in the surface near region of the metallic material or both improves the flow of the metallic material during the shaping, whereby smaller or less oraG|<g and a better corrosion resistance may be created.></g>
By an amount of hafnium, titanium, zirconium or any mixture of these containing layer on the shaped miallic surface, by a chemically modified metellic surface or by both, a better carrying and holding of an oll/emulslfier/ester/ coolant-based composition on the metallic suriaoe during the shaping under severe conditions may be aooomplished. Then there may be used a thinner film of such lubri¬cant/coolant composition. Even the tools seem to work longer, which is a big advantage for the can maker, too, as there occur high costs at the cup-nrrakers and the body-makera, The tool life may be prolonged from e.g. about 18 months to about 20 to 24 months e.g. for a specific cuppang tool.<br>
At least one acidic cleaning step for cleaning the bodies or shaped articles from dirt, oil, coolant(s) etc. is necessary, whereby the surface of the shaped articles is cleaned and optionally etched to get rid e.g. of the oxide generated upon the metallic surface especially on aluminum rich metallic materials. The aqueous acidic cleaning composition used for an-etchirig may comprise at least one acid selected from the grcup consisting of hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and other mineral acid(s) or may comprise at least one oxidizing agent like a per¬oxide like hydrogen peroxide e.g. together with ions of Fe.<br>
Prefwably, the shaped metallic cups, bodies or articles are rinsed or cleaned or both. They may be cleaned in an alkaline solution or dispersion, cleaned or etched or both in an acidic solution or dispersion or cleaned in a combination of the same, of similar or of different cleaning steps in the baths' succession vihich may contain the same, similar or quite different chemical compositions like even<br>
 <br>
a combination of alksiine cleaning and acidic cieaning, Preferably, the cleaning may be a weak etching whereby there are removed 1 to 12 mg/m from the sur¬face of the metallic material, more preferred 2 to 8 mg/in<br>
The etching may be used to make the surface of the shaped article bright and clean. A low etching may remove 3 to 10 mg/m e.g. of aluminum or aluminum alloy. But a high etching rate often creates an increased surface roughness which typically leads to higher friction which thert loViers the production speed. Therefore, it may be favorable to control the punching and drawing very well not to Increase the surface roughness by necessary high etching rates.<br>
Preferably, at least a part of a surface or of the surfaces of the shaped metallic cups, bodies or articles whidi have been rinsed or cleaned or both shows a con¬tent of hafnium, titanium or zirconium or any combination of them which has its origin from 8ie coaiing of the msiallic coil or of the metaUic sheets.<br>
Preferably, the shaped mstaliic cups, bodies or articles are treated then in some embodiments according to the invention with a solution or dispersion for improv¬ing the corrosion resistance, for the mobility enhancement, for paint adhesion or ink adhesion or for any combination of these improvements.<br>
Preferably, the bodies or articles, especially casings or containers like cans, are produced in some embodiments according to the invention without applying a mobility enhancer compositjon on their surfaces or with applng such a compo¬sition which is a less environmental unfriendly composition, a less concentrated composition, a less expensive composition, a composition generating a less rough coating or any combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the shap metallic bodies or articles are produced in some em¬bodiments according to the invention by applying a dome stain (pre-) treatment or a mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment or both on their surfaces which contains at least one composition comprising a content of at least one phosphonate or of at least one phosphonic acid or both, especially such compounds having mole-<br>
 <br>
cules with an alkyl chain in a part or in a middle part of such molecules, most preferred with an ali<yl cliain showing to carbon atoms which may have the same molecule structure as mentioned below.></yl>
During the dome stain (pre-) treatment, the aqueous composition may be e.g. sprayed from the top only onto the top of a dome or of a base face from the out¬side of an e.g. downward standing body. The dome stain (pre-) treatment may be omitted or further used in the process according to the invention, e.g. further used by applying an aqueous composition containing at least one phospbonate or phosphonic aoid or both, especially at lea one phosphonate or at least one phosphonic acid having an alkyl chain in the middle of the molecule, preferably of an aikyi chain v/ith 4 to 40 or with 6 to 32 carbon atoms, more preferred with 8 to 20 carbon atoms, most preferred with 10,12,14,16 on 8 carbon atoms, es¬pecially having an unbranohed alkyl chain, or by applying another, primarily or totally inorganic aqueous composition.<br>
By using no dome stain (pre-) treatment or a dome stain (pre-) treatment without any fluorine content, it is possible to create a process far treatment respectively pre-treatment without any fluorine content e.g. in the Vi/hole baths of the washer or only with a fluorine content In one or two baths like in a dome stain (pre-) treatment bath, which Is a considerable advantage as there is an increasing de¬mand of avoiding every content of fluorine. If there is a fluorine containing clean¬ing step in stage 2, a certein fluorine content is typically taken to the bath of stage 1 and opijonally to the bath of stage 0, too.<br>
Because of the coating of the used medBlllc coil or matallic sheets, especially aluminum alloy stock, according to the present invention, there may occur that there \&amp; no longer a necessity for a corrosion resistant (pre-) treatment like a dome stain (pro-) treatment. If there is no dome stain coating used or no rough coating generated, there is typically a less rough surfece generated on the shaped ailicles, so that they show an excellent gliding behavior and less friction so that there may be no need for the application of a mobility enhancer.<br>
 <br>
A mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment enables 1. a lower friction and 2- a lower surface tension of the water: Thereof, a better drying results, but the droplets at the bottom may lead to a slight salt ring because of the relatively high concentra¬tion of this bath. If another composition type would be used for a mobility enhan¬cer (pre-) treatrrtent like an aqueous composition containing at least one phos-phonate respectively phosphonio acid, especially having a longer alkyl chain in the middle of the molecule, this would result in significantly !ovu!6red friction of the can bodies, and there would not occur any salt rings, but often there would not be a lowered surface tension of the vter except by addition of a small amount of at least one surfactant.<br>
If fluorine, especialty as a monofluoride, as a bifluoride, as hydrofluoric acid or as any combination thereof is added to or contained in a cleaning bath, it is often only added to the bath of stage 2, but there may be a certain fluorine bacicflow transmitted to the baths before, especially to the baths of the stages 1 and op¬tionally 0.<br>

Especially preferred is a content of a fluorine compound like a complex fluoride I     e.g. of zirconium, titanium, hafnium or any combination thereof in the bath of the<br>
 <br>
dome stain (pre-) treatment, often together with a content of at ieast one phos-piiorus compound i8<ean orthophosphate.></ean>
The application of a mobility enhancer would not be necessary or would hs less necessary if tiie dome stain (pre-) treatment would be on the base of a composi¬tion wlijch does not generate a rough, but a well glidable coating like from a composition containing at least one phosphonate or at least one phosphonic acid or both or If there would not be applied any such coating especially in a stage 4 bath or a similar bath of the washer, If e.g. such a composition would be applied on a base of a composition containing at least one phosphonate/phosphonic acid, the generated coating would be effective as a corrosion inhibiting, adhesion promoting and mobility enhancing coating. It has been proved that a coating prepared from an aqueous composition containing at ieast one phosphonic acid or at ieast one phosphonate or any derivative or any mixture of it, having an all chain in the molecLile, shows a remarkably high mobility enhancing effect. Such a coating may be totally free of zirconium, titanium, hafnium or any combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the such (pre-) treated shaped articles show a corrosion protecting coating having an essentia! content of at least one type of fluorine containing anion like fluoride, at least one hydroxide, at ieast one oxide, at least one phos¬phate, at least one phosphonate or any combination thereof whereby the coating fias a content of hafnium, titanium, zirconium or any combination thereof.<br>
Nevertheless, it is preferred to reduce the amount of fluorine containing com¬pounds as far as possible because of environmental reasons. Therefore, it is in some embodiments preferred that even the baths following the cleaning and rinsing of the shaped metallic articles are totally or essentially free from fluorine.<br>
In an especially prefen'ed process, the shaped metallic bodies or articles are produced by using a fluorine-free cleaning and rinsing process, Typically, today, most of the cleaning battis for aluminum cans are used with a fluorine containing<br>
 <br>
acidic cleaning composition for tiie etching and cleaning of tine shaped metallic articles.<br>
Preferabiy, the shaped meialiic bodies or articles are treated or pre-treated in a washer with baths that are essentially or totally free of fluorine, either having a fluorine content of up to 0.01 g/L of Fi, or not more fhan few ppm of fluorine which may be in some situations a constituent e.g. of the water used.<br>
Preferably, the shaped articles are coated with a mobility enhancing compositioh containing at least one phosphonic acid, at least one phosphonate, at least one derivative thereof or any combination thereof. The therewith generated coating may often be at the same time useful as a corrosion inhibiting and therefore dome stain protecting, adhesion Improving and mobility enhancing coating. Therefore, it could preferably be used for the stages 4 or 7 or both, even if it would be only applied one time.<br>
The pH value of a mobility enhancer composition may in some embodiments be crucial too, as above pH 7 of a surfactant based composition salt depositions like salt rings may occur at edges of the shaped arijoles, Tharefore, if the pH would be made slightly acidic e.g. kept in the range from pH 4.5 to pH 6.5 or at a significantly lowed concentration of the mobility enhancer composition or by both, such salt depositions may often be avoided,<br>
Because of the farming of salt depositions and other reasons mentioned at the beginning, It is preferred to reduce the content of chemicals in a mobility enhan¬cer composition, perhaps to a significantly lower concentration of at least one surfactant or their derivatives or both lile to a range from 0.001 to 0.3 g/L, pref¬erably in a range from 0.05 to 0.12 g/L, or even to avoid such chemicals totally.<br>
The method according to the present invention may be used for the production of hollow articles like a container or like a casing, especially as a beverage can or food can'or as a casing for switches.<br>

Figure 2 shows a bath succession of a washer which may be used for a body (pre-) treatment according to the invention in an essentially or totally fluorine-free process.<br>
In the process of the (pre-) treatment of these bodies or shaped articles and of the printing of these outside wUh ink or with paint orvnth ink and paint (varnish) and perhaps even inside coating with paint, the fdlowlng process variations may be used in a washer;<br>
Process A: The whole conventional process with all stages as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Process B: A process with a. conventional cleaning and rinsing without a dome stain (pre-) treatment, but with a mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Process C: A process with a conventional cleaning and rinsing, but without a dome stain (pre-) treatment and without a mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Process D: A process with a fluorine-free cleaning and rinsing, but the further I     process was as conventional, which is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Process E: A process with a fluorine-free cleaning and rinsing, but without a dome ain (pre-) treatment, but with a mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
 <br>
Process F: A process with a fluorine-free cieanlng and rinsing, but wittiout a dome stain (pre-) treatment and witliout a mobility enhancer (pre-) treatment as shown In Fig. 2.<br>
Optionaily, in the processes B, C, E or F or in any further variation of them, at least one of the rinsing stages of water or of Di water or of both may be omitted or a two stage rinsing A/B may be shortened to only one rinsing stage A. There¬fore, there are good chances to shorten the process in s washer in many em¬bodiments.<br>
The prefen-ed treatment time of the metallic components in the different iaaths may generally be, especially in Process A rasp, in the corresponding baths of similar processes, whereby the numbering of Process A is used here:<br>
Pre-rlnse Stage 0:0.1 to 1 s,<br>
Precleaning Stage 1: 3 to 20 s,<br>
IWain Wash Stage 2: 20 to 6D s,<br>
Rinse Stage 3A: 3 to 20 s,<br>
Rinse Stage 3B; 8 to 30 s,<br>
(Pr6-)Treatment Stage 4:5 to 25 s, especially 10 to 20 s,<br>
Rinse Stage 5A: 5 to 30 s,<br>
Rinse Stage 5B: 5 to 30 a,<br>
Rec. DI Water Stage 6: 10 to 50 s,<br>
Mabilfty Enhancer Stage 7: 3 to 30 s, especially S to 20 s.<br>
It was astonishing that the zirconium content of the zirconium containing coat¬ing, especially as a passivation layer, present on the metaliic coil or on the metal¬lic slieets tested vvas not totally removed in the shaping and In the thereon fol¬lowing cleaning process. Therefore, it Is believed that the zirconium content of the zirconium phosphate of this layer was at least partially transformed and in¬corporated into the surface of the aluminum alloy during the shaping including a drawing step and a wall ironing step in the body-mal«rs, especially due to the<br>
 <br>
high pressure and perhaps due to the high temperatures present during shap¬ing.<br>
It was very surprising that the etching of the cans in the stages 0 to 2 of the so-called cleaning did not eliminate the whole content of arconium ir the surface near region of cans, but that there occurred a certain content of 2irconium com-pound(s) despite an acidic cleaning of about 50 to 60 seconds in the stages 0 to 2 together respectively of about 40 to 45 seconds only In stage 2.<br>
It was surprising that the shaping of coaled metallic material has improved the tool life fc)eoause of a higher holding of lube on the metallic surface during the shaping.<br>
It was surprising tliat the wear of the tools is reduced as there Is less oxide on the surface of the metallic material llke very hard aluminum oxide which may be very effective as a grinding medium.<br>
It was surprising that the coated metallic material carries the ail, emulsifier(s), ether(s), coolant(B) or any combination of these containing compositions better than conventional uncoatsd metallic materials.<br>
EXAMPLES AND COMPARISON EXAMPLES<br>
The examples and comparison examples described in the following are intended to elucidate the subject-matter of the invtion in more detail. The specified con¬centrations and compositions in table 1 relate to the aqueous compositions as used in the bath for coating the coil.<br>
A coil made of the aluminum altoy 3104 (AIMgl Mn 1) to be used for the produc¬tion of the body of a laeverage can was coated with the aid of a rollcoater at a line speed of 120 m/min with an aqueous composition as shown in table 1 to pro¬duce a dried on coating.<br>
 <br>
The such coated coils had a thin oil containing film of a post-lube which was not removed. The coll was unwrapped in the uncoiler and was lead to the cup-maker, where the coil was first sprayed with an oil containing lubricant on both sides which was then squeezed so that there were films of about 250 mglm2 on every side before shaping the cups. Then, the cups were transported to the body-maker, where they were first sprayed with an oil and coolant containing composition which mixed with the dirt and oil containing composition left on the cups to have a lubricant and coolant film during the shaping of long can bodies having a significantly smaller outer diameter and significantly smaller wall thick¬nesses than the cups. Then the can bodies were trimmed at the top to have a defined body length and to create precise edges. Then they were transported to the series of baths of the washer.<br>

Further on, in one of the further examples a composition on the base of ammo¬nium zirconium carbonate together with an organic polymer or a small amount of wax like polyethylene wax or both was applied,<br>
