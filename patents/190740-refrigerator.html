				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly to a refrigerator which has a cool air passage and swing-wing system both capable of distributing cool air into a refrigerating compartment.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a conventional refrigerator is constituted by mounting a freezing compartment door 6 and a refrigerating compartment door 7 on a refrigerator body 4 of a thermally insulated structure forming a freezing compartment 2 and a refrigerating compartment 3 which are partitioned from each other by an intermediate partition wall 1 therebetween.<br>
A compressor 11 is installed in a motor compartment 11M that is positioned under the refrigerating compartment 3, condenser and capillary tube(not shown) are mounted in the interior of the body 4 or placed in the machine compartment 11M, and an evaporator 12 is mounted on the rear wall of the freezing compartment 2. The components are connected to each other by refrigerant tubes(not shown) to perform a refrigeration cycle.<br>
A fan 13 for forcing cool air from the evaporator 12 into  the  freezing compartment 2  and  the  refrigerating<br>
compartment 3, is disposed above the evaporator 12. In order to guide the flow of the cool air, a grill 14 is placed before the fan 13 and a cool air duct 15a is disposed at the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3. Here, numeral 19 indicates a control damper for controlling the quantity of cool air which is introduced into the refrigerating compartment 3, and numeral 8 indicates shelves for receiving food items.<br>
As a method for supplying cool air to the refrigerating compartment, a conventional refrigerator generally adopts a shelf-by-shelf cool air discharge method. As shown in Fig. 2, in this method a plurality of cool air discharge openings 16a, which is provided for several areas partitioned by the shelves 8, is arranged in the up-and-down direction on the cool air duct 15a, so cool air is discharged towards the front into each areas formed by the plurality of shelves 8.<br>
In the above shelf-by-shelf cool air discharge method, uniform distribution of the cooled air is not achieved since areas in the direct path of the blown air receives more cooled air than the remote areas. Arrangement of the food items further contributes to this problem. As an example, a bulky food item near a cool air discharge openings blocks the flow of air, thus such an area receives less cooled air. Still futher problem exist in that since the cool air discharge  openings  16a  are  perpendicular  to  the  flow<br><br>
direction of cool air going through the cool air duct 15a, only a small portion of the cool air from the evaporator 12 passes through the upper cool air discharge openings, but most of the cool air flows down through the cool air duct 15a and discharges into the refrigerating compartment 3 through the lowest cool air discharge openings 16a. Accordingly, food items on the upper shelves of the refrigerating compartment 3 can not keep a proper refrigerating temperature, whereas the food items on the lower shelves are overcooled. Another problem exist in that some newly stored food items may be at an initial temperature significantly higher than the temperature in the cooling compartment. In this case, a need arises for concentrating the cooled air flow to the warm/hot food item to effect rapid cooling as well as to avoid warming of the immediately surrounding food items. Conventional systems does not offer such a compensating means. Accordingly, above described situations contribute to an undesired condition in which there may exist a significant variation of temperatures throughout the cooling compartment.<br>
In an attempt to distribute the cool air more evenly, a three-wall cool air discharging method has recently been developed. As shown in Fig. 3, a refrigerator according to this method has a plurality of cool air discharge openings 16s on the side walls of the refrigerating compartment 3 as<br>
well as the cool air discharge openings 16a on the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3, in order to discharge cool air from the side walls as well as the rear wall.<br>
However, such a refrigerator fails to provide an uniform air flow throughout the cooling compartment. That is, there still exist areas ,such as corners, which are not directly exposed to the cooled air flow. Furthermore, such a refrigerator does not offer means to concentrate the cooled air flow to a specified area depending upon the detected condition of the cooling compartment.<br>
Above inadequacies of conventional referigerators are especially clear in the case that food items of a higher temperature are stored at remote areas such as the upper or lower corners of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Since larger-capacity refrigerators suffer the above problems more noticeably and since consumer demand for such refrigerators have been increasing, the need for solving the above problems have become increasingly important.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, accordingly, an object of this invention to provide a refrigerator capable of maintaining an uniform temperature over the whole volume of a cooling compartment by evenly dispersing the evaporated cool air in multi-directions<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In Fig. 4, the refrigerator is comprised of a body 4 shielded by an insulating material which includes a freezing compartment 2 and a refrigerating compartment 3, which are partitioned by an intermediate wall 1. Further, respective compartments 2,3 are' equipped with doors 6,7 on the front side of the compartments 2,3. In the refrigerating compartment 3 are installed a plurality of shelves 8 for placing foodstuffs. At the upper portion of the refrigerating compartment 3 is formed the third compartment 9 for allowing the foodstuffs to be stored within a temperature range relative to the individual characteristics of the specific foodstuffs. A vegetable compartment 10 is formed at the lowest portion of the refrigerating compartment 3. A compressor 11 is installed in a motor compartment 11M, and a<br>
condenser and a pressure reducing device, which are not shown are installed in the wall of the body 4 or in a motor compartment 11M. Further, the evaporator 12 is mounted in the rear wall of the freezing compartment 2. All of the components are interconnected by a refrigerant tube (not shown) for accomplishing the refrigerating cycle.<br>
Above the evaporator 12 is installed a fan 13 for forcefully blowing the cool air generated from the evaporator 12 into the freezing compartment 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3. To guide the cool air, a grill 14 is mounted^ in front of the fan 13. At the rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 3 is mounted a cool air distribution apparatus 17 having a cool air passage and discharge openings which will be explained later. Thus, the cool air generated by the evaporator 12 is divided between the freezing compartment 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3. Numeral 5 is a recess for housing the cool air distribution apparatus 17.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the cool air distribution apparatus 17 is installed at the central portion of the rear wall 3W of the refrigerating compartment 3. An upper portion of the air distribution apparatus 17 is positioned behind the third compartment 9, while a middle and a lower portion of the air distribution apparatus 17 are positioned behind the area of the refrigerating compartment 3 excluding the third compartment 9 and the vegetable compartment 10. That is, the<br>
upper end of the air distribution apparatus 17 is placed adjacent to the intermediate wall 1, and the lower end thereof is placed adjacent to the vegetable compartment 10. The entire height of the air distribution apparatus 17 approximately equals the height of the refrigerating compartment 3 plus the third compartment 9.<br>
The cool air distribution apparatus 17, as shown in Fig. 6, comprises a front plate 24 made from a synthetic resin, a rear plate 25 which is made from insulated material and is assembled with-„±he front plate 24, a seal plate 34 covering the back face of the rear plate 25. A swing-wing 2 6 is detachably provided at the forehead surface of the front plate 24. At the upper end of the swing-wing 26 is provided a motor 28 for operating the swing member 26. The motor 28 seated on a motor case 29 is installed in the upper portion of the front plate 24. At each side end of the motor 28 is mounted an indoor lamp 30. Numeral 31 is a lamp cover for shielding the lamps 30.<br>
In the embodiment, since the motor 28 is seal-mounted at the upper portion of the swing-wing 26, moisture of the compartment can not penetrate into the motor 28. Because the moisture or the condensed water flows down due to its gravity even when the formation of moisture or the condensed water, there is no worry about its penetration into the motor 28. Further,  there  is  less  possibility  of  the  moisture<br>
penetration due to the motor being housed by the case 29. The excess cooling caused by the decrease of the motor speed can not occur due to the indirect contact of moist air. Even if the water penetrates, the water is immediately evaporated by the heat from the lamps 30 mounted nearby, thereby preventing the problem of inoperablity of the motor 28 due to the penetration of the water and further, the inactiablity of the swing-wing 26. Thus, this has the advantage that a decrease of the motor speed, with respect to the electrical mal-contact, an insulation failure due to the penetration of the moisture, and the excess cooling in according to the frost of the penetrating water, never occurs. In the embodiment, a geared motor of which the rotation speed is fixed is employed as the operating motor. However, a stepping motor can be employed to control the rotation speed of the swing-wing as well as the rotation of the forward and the reverse of the swing-wing.<br>
Numeral 32 which was not explained is a position sensing switch for controlling the rotation position of the swing-wing 26, which is "on/off"ed by a protuberance 33 provided at the upper end of the swing-wing 26. Numeral 27 is a grill detachably assembled with the front plate 24 for the protection of the swing-wing 26. The grill 27 prevents foodstuffs housed in the compartment from prohibiting the rotation of the swing-wing 26.<br>
In Figs.  7 and 8,  the upper portion of the air<br>
distribution apparatus 17 comprises an air passage 18 for<br>
guiding the flow of the cool air generated from the<br>
evaporator 12, a baffle plate 19 for regulating the cool air<br>
volume fed into the refrigerating compartment 3 according to<br>
the opening/shutting of the baffle plate 19, and a motor 20<br>
for operating the baffle plate 19. The temperature control<br>
utilized"~by these components is achieved by the same method<br>
of the conventional method. Numeral 21 is a baffle cover and<br>
is  integrally formed with the front plate 24 in the<br>
embodiment. Numeral 22 is a spacer which is made from an<br>
insulated material. The thickened spacer 22 prevents the<br>
frost, which is caused by amount of cool air through the air<br>
passage 18, from generating on the outside wall of the baffle<br>
cover 21. The spacer 22 may be sized approximately 10 cm in<br>
depth and 34cm in width. This size is proper for the 400 to<br>
500 liter volume refrigerator, since the size is dependent on<br>
the volume of the refrigerator. Numeral 23 is an air<br>
discharge opening which is provided at the upper portion of<br>
the front plate 24, by which the cool air through the air<br>
passage 18 is discharged into the third compartment 9. In the<br>
embodiment, a couple of the discharging openings 2 3 are<br>
formed at the upper portion of the front plate 24. Therefore,<br>
the third compartment 9 holds the lower temperature than the<br>
refrigerating compartment 3, since the travelling distance of<br>
the air from the air passage 18 to the air discharging opening 23 is shorter than that from the air passage 18 to the middle and the lower portion of the air distribution apparatus 17.<br>
Next, the middle and the lower portion, except the upper<br>
portion,  of  the  air  distribution  apparatus  17  is<br>
approximately 3cm in depth, 25cm in width. The whole air<br>
distribution apparatus 17 can be made from an injection mold<br>
material, but the front plate 24 of 2mm thickness is formed<br>
by a synthetic resin mold and assembled with the rear plate<br>
25 formed as a styrofoam in the embodiment. The swing-wing 26<br>
disposed before the middle and the lower portion of the front<br>
plate 24 is comprised with a wing member 26a and a columnar<br>
member 2 6b. The four sets of the wing member 26a are<br>
integrally formed to the columnar member 26b. The position of<br>
respective wing members 26a corresponds with the partitioned<br>
space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment<br>
3. The uppermost wing member 261 is disposed at 3/4H, the<br>
middle wing member 262 at 1/2H, and the lower wing member 263<br>
at 1/3H,  assuming that the height of the refrigerating<br>
compartment 3 is "H". A phantom (dummy) wing member 49 is<br>
disposed between the middle wing member 262 and the lower<br>
wing member 263. The position of the phantom (dummy) wine<br>
member 49 is irrelevant to the position of the shelves 8, and<br>
it  is  provided  for  considering  the  appearance  and<br>
manufacturing ease of the air distribution apparatus 17. The configuration of the swing-wing 26 will be detail explained later.<br>
The distribution apparatus 17 formed with an assembled type is detachably installed on the rear wall 3W, and it is more desirable that the front plate 24 is placed against an even surface with respect to the rear wall 3W of the refrigerating compartment 3. That is, as shown in Fig. 6, the seal plate 34 adheres to the rear side of the rear plate 25 which is assembled with the front plate 24, and the swing-wing 2 6 and the grill 27 are assembled to the front plate 24, and then the motor 28 and the indoor lamp 30 are assembled. Finally, the assembly is inserted in the rear wall 3W (Fig.5). Therefore, in comparison to a prior art apparatus in which many individual components are installed in the refrigerating compartment, respectively, the installation work using the components of the present invention is more simple. Numeral 17a is a thread assembling portion for installing the air distribution apparatus 17 on the rear wall 3W conveniently.<br>
In Fig.9A, the air distribution apparatus 17 comprises an air passage 15 and the openings 16 which discharge the air from the air passage 15 into the refrigerating compartment 3. The air passage 15 is formed in a longitudinal direction at the rear surface of the air distribution apparatus 17. The<br>
openings 16 are penetratedly formed at the air distribution apparatus 17 for connecting the air passage 15 and the refrigerating compartment 3. The opening 16 is provided in an up and down manner along the vertical center line. The air passage 15 is provided with a first duct 35 and a second duct 36, each of which is arranged adjacent to both vertical edges of the apparatus 17 centering at the openings 16. The respective openings 16A, 16B and 16C are positioned to correspond to the partitive space between the shelves 8 in the same way to the wing member 26a. In the embodiment, ahead of each opening 16 is arranged the wing member 26a of the swing-wing 26 (Fig.7), and thus, the number of the openings is 3. Since the air passage 15 has first and second ducts 35,36 at both vertical side, and the wing member 26a is placed ahead of the opening 16, where the thickness of the air distribution apparatus 17 is thinnest. Also, the protruding height of the distribution apparatus 17 toward the refrigerating compartment 3 is lowered, thereby preventing the available volume of the refrigerating compartment 3 from decreasing.<br>
The upper portion of the first, second duct 35,36 is expanded toward both side of the air passage 18, respectively, while the lower portion of the first, second duct 35,36 toward the vegetable compartment 10. The air, through the air passage 18 by the opening of the baffle plate<br>
19 (Fig.8), is branchedly flowed into the first, second ducts 35,36. Most of the air is flowed down along the ducts 35,36 to be discharged into the refrigerating, the vegetable compartments 3, 10. The remaining volume of the air is discharged toward the third compartment 9 through the discharging opening 23 (Fig.8). For guiding the downflowing air into the refrigerating compartment 3, the air passage 15 comprises a first branch duct 37 which connects the first duct 35 and the opening 16, and a second branch duct 38 which connects the second duct 36 and the opening 16. Thus, the air flowing along the first, the second ducts 35,36 is guided to the first, the second branch ducts 37A,37B,37C, 38A,38B,38C, thereby discharging into the refrigerating compartment 3 through respective openings 16A,16B,16C.<br>
The first, second branch ducts 37,38, as shown in Fig.9B, has a wide inlet which is connected to the first, second ducts 35,36, and a narrow outlet which is connected to the opening 16. The wide inlet of the branch ducts 37,38 has the configuration that the upper portions 37U,38U are rounded and the lower portion is shaped to the shoulder 371,372,373 in which the middle shoulder 372 is more extended outwardly ( the right and the left hand of Fig.9B) than the uppermost shoulder 371, and the lower shoulder 373 is more extended outwardly than the middle shoulder 372. The flowing down air along the ducts 35,36 is caught by the shoulders 371,372.373<br>
in a parallel fashion to smoothly flow toward the exit of the branch ducts 37,38.<br>
It is more desirable that the rounded length of the<br>
upper portions 37U,38U of the middle branch duct 37B is<br>
longer than that of the uppermost branch duct 37A, and the<br>
rounded length of the upper portions 37U,38U of the lower<br>
branch duct 37C is longer than that of the middle branch duct<br>
37B. The protruding length of the shoulder is larger as the<br>
position of the shoulder goes lower. Since the earlier<br>
discharging air  has  a  longer  length  to  travel,  the<br>
temperature of the air is higher. The lower it goes, the<br>
greater amount of air is needed.  The configuration of the<br>
branch ducts 37,38 as above is very helpful to minimize the<br>
deviation of the air temperature in respect with the height<br>
of the refrigerating compartment 3. That is, more volume air<br>
is fed through the middle branch ducts 37B,38B than the air<br>
is fed through the uppermost branch ducts 37A,38A, the lower<br>
branch ducts 37C,38C than the middle branch ducts 37B,38B.<br>
This achieves the uniform cooling in the refrigerating<br>
compartment'3.<br>
Next, at the lower end of the first, the second ducts 35,36, i.e. below the inlet of the first,the second branch ducts 37C,38C are provided banks 48 having a predetermined height for reducing the air volume supplied to the vegetable compartment  10 and increasing the air volume  for the<br>
refrigerating compartment 3 through the opening 16. Thus, the temperature of the refrigerating compartment 3 stays lower than the vegetable compartment 10.<br>
Furthermore, to feed the cool air in a right or a left<br>
hand direction into the refrigerating compartment 3, the<br>
opening 16A comprises a first discharging portion 39A<br>
connected to the first branch duct 37A, and a second<br>
discharging portion 40A connected to the second branch duct<br>
38A. It is more desirable that the vertical center line Y-Y<br>
of the first discharging portion 39A is not aligned to that<br>
Z-Z of the second discharging portion 39A. That is, the<br>
vertical center line Y-Y of the first discharging portion 39A<br>
is moved toward the first branch duct 37A with respect to the<br>
vertical center line X-X of the opening 16A, while the<br>
vertical center line Z-Z of the second discharging portion<br>
40A is moved toward the second branch duct 38A with respect<br>
to the vertical center line X-X of the opening 16A. The air<br>
through the opening 16A is discharged in each different<br>
direction, thereby causing the smooth discharge flow into the<br>
refrigerating compartment 3. When the air through the first<br>
discharging portion 39A is directed toward the left side, the<br>
air through the second discharging portion 40A is directed<br>
toward the right side. The air is smoothly discharged without<br>
the head-to-head collision. Next, in the opening 16B adjacent<br>
to the opening 16A, the position of the first,  second<br>
discharging portions 37B,38B are reversed with respect to that of the first, second discharging portions 37A,38A. That is, in the case that at the opening 16A the first discharging portion 39A is placed above the second discharging portion 40A, at the opening 16B the second discharging portion 40B is placed above the first discharging portion 39B. The quicker the air is discharged, the more the temperature of the air rises. In the opening 16B, through the branch duct 38B a relatively cooler air than the temperature of the air reaching the branch duct 37B is supplied. Next, in the opening 16C, through the branch duct 37C a relatively cooler air than the temperature of the air reaching the branch duct 38C is supplied. This achieves the uniform cooling in the refrigerating compartment, prohibiting the deviation of air temperature between the right and the left side of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Figs. 10A,10B and IOC show a part of various embodiments of the swing-wing 26. The swing-wing 26 comprises a plurality of wing members 26a and a columnar member 26b. The wing member 26a comprises a dividing plate 44 having an upper plate 41, a middle plate 42 and a lower plate 43 which are arranged spacing each other in a horizontal manner. The wing member 26a further comprises a distributing wing 47 which provides a first inducing wing 45 formed perpendicularly between the upper plate 41 and the middle plate 42 and a<br>
second inducing wing 4 6 formed perpendicularly between the middle plate 42 and the lower'plate 43. In the embodiment, three sets 261,262,263 of the wing member 26a formed with the dividing plate 44 and the distributing wing 47 are integrally assembled to the columnar member 2 6b ( the remaining one 49 will be explained later.)- That is, the swing-wing 26 is formed so that the three wing members 26a having the dividing plate 44 and the distributing wing 47 are integrally provided to the columnar member 26b. The upper end of the swing-wing 26 is connected to an output shaft (Fig. 6) of the driving motor 28 to operate the swing-wing 26. It is more desirable that the columnar member 26b is shaped with a crisscross in a crosssection.<br>
Numeral 49, in Figs. 10A and 10B, is a phantom(dummy) wing set which is irrelalent to the discharge of the cool air. Since no opening is provided at the corresponding position to the phantom (dummy) wing 49, it is directly irrelalent to the discharging flow of the air. However, through the gap G (Fig. 8) between the rear surface of the grill 27 and the circumference of the swing-wing 26, the cool air is fed into the space housing the phantom (dummy) wing 49. The air in the space is stirred by the phantom (dummy) wing 49 to increase the distribution effect with respect to the flow-down air to the lower wing member 263. Further, the balancing arrangement of the wing member provides  the<br>
external harmony.<br>
The swing-wing 2 6 is detachably formed as shown in Fig.lOB  to  solve  the  problem  rising  from  the  tool manufacturing process. At the upper portion of the swing-wing 2 6 is provided with the upper wing member 261 and the middle wing member 262, and at the lower portion of the swing-wing 2 6 is provided with the lower wing member 263. In the case that the respective distributing wings 47 are molded in a different position to each other ( will be explained in more detail later), it has the difficulty that one cavity molding tool can not be used. Therefore, the swing-wing 26 is divided into two portions. In the upper portions 261,262 of the swing-wing 26 the one edges 47E,47E' of the distributing wings 45,46 are arranged in a 90°C to each other. In the lower portion 49,263 of the swing-wing 26 the one edges 47E",47E"'of the distributing wing 45,46 are arranged in a zero or 180°C to each other. Thus, if the assembling degree between the upper portions 261,262 and the lower portions 49,263 can be changed, the layout of the whole distributing wings 45,46 can be varied. In the embodiment, the edges 47E", 47E"'are disposed in the center between the one edge 47E and the one edge 47E'. Fig.IOC shows the variable embodiment, which illustrates the swing-wing 26 without the phantom (dummy) wing set 49.<br>
As   the  previous   illustration,   the   respective<br>
distributing  wings  47  are  placed  in  front  of  the corresponding openings 16, and the position of the dividing plate 44 and the openings 16 correspond.with the partitioned space between the shelves 8 of the refrigerating compartment 3. Fig.11 shows that the swing-wing 26 is disposed in front of the front plate 24. The middle plate 42 of the dividing plate 44 is disposed at the border between the first discharging portion 39A and the second discharging portion 40A. The upper plate 41 is disposed above the middle plate 42 with the height of the first discharging portion 39A, while the lower plate 43 is disposed beneath the middle plate 42 with the height of the second discharging portion 40A. The upper 41/ the middle 42 and the lower 43 plates have the same diameter. The diameter approximately equals the width of the opening 16 so as to prevent the cool air leakage. The space defined by the upper plate 41, the middle plate 42 and the first discharging portion 39A forms an individual rotating passage with the help of the duct extended from the branch duct 37A. Also, the space defined by the middle plate 42, the lower plate 43 and the second discharging portion 40A forms another individual rotating passage with the help of the duct extended from the branch duct 38A. The individual rotating passages  help  to  discharge  the  air  forward  in  the refrigerating compartment without being descending. It keeps the weak air discharged in approximately a horizontal<br>
direction into the refrigerating compartment even when the swing wing is in the slow rotation mode.<br>
Further, the first distributing wing 45 and the second distributing wing 46 are disposed with a symmetrical shaft as shown in Fig.12. In more detail, the inducing wings 45,46 are provided with a concave 50 and a convex 51 which are rounded in series, respectively. That is, the concave 50 and the convex 51 are smoothly connected to be formed in a "S" shape. Thus, the air is smoothly discharged along the first, second inducing wings,j£J5,46 through the opening 16. Next, the first inducing wing 45 has a different position with respect to the second inducing wing 46. The concave 50 of the first inducing wing 45 is reversely positioned to the convex 51 of the second inducing wing 46, while the convex 51 of the first inducing wing 45 is reversely positioned to the concave 50 of the second inducing wing 46. The disposition of the inducing wings  45,46  is  for  reducing  the  flow  resistance, corresponding to the disposition of the first,  second discharging portions 39A,40A. The air guided by the inducing wings 45,46 impinges on the convex 51 largely, and flows over the  convex  51,  thereby  remarkably  reducing  the  flow resistance. When the vertical center line Y-Y of the first distributing portion 39A is disposed toward the first branch duct 37A with respect to the vertical center line X-X of the opening 16A as shown in Fig.9B, the convex 51 of the first<br>
distributing wing 45 is disposed to the slight right side of the opening 16A. Alternatively;- when the vertical center line Z-Z of the second distributing portion 40A is disposed toward the second branch duct 38A with respect to the vertical center line X-X of the opening 16A as shown in Fig.9B, the convex 51 of the second distributing wing 46 is disposed to the slight left side of the opening 16A. Thus, the air guided through the first branch duct 37A at the right side is<br>
•	■•UBS-.<br>
impingedly flowed onto the convex 51 of the first inducing wing 45, while the air guided through the second branch duct' 38A at the left side is impingedly flowed onto the convex 51 of the second distributing, wing 46, which develops a main flow.<br>
As to the forementioned (Figs.10A,10B and IOC), assuming that the edge 47E of the upper wing member 261 is the basis, the edge 47E' of the middle wing member 262 is disposed at about 90°C, and the edge 47E"' of the lower wing member 263 is disposed at about 45°C. Since the upper, the middle and the lower distributing wings 261,262,263 are arranged in a different position degree with each other, the impinging point and the discharging direction onto/from the distributing wing 47 of the cool air is variant, thereby causing the load applied to the distributing wing 47 to diminish. If the edges 47E,47E',47E",47E"'of the inducing wings 45,46 are aligned, the cool air discharged from even<br>
the different rotating position impinges onto the distributing wing in the same" direction, causes excessive load on the swing-wing. In the embodiment, the degrees of the arrangement of the distributing wing sets are different with each other and the problem of the excessive load can not occur.<br>
The edges 47E,47E',47E"' are disposed within about 90°C independent of the rotating position of the swing-wing 26. At the same time, the other edges are disposed within about 90°C at the opposite side.<br>
Fig. 10D illustrates another embodiment of the swing-wing 26. The concave 50 of the first inducing wing 45' is disposed with the concave 50 of the second inducing wing 46 in the same direction. Further, the convex 51 of the first inducing wing 45' is disposed with the convex 51 of the second distributing wing 46 in the same direction.<br>
Fig. 10E shows another embodiment of the swing-wing 26w. The swing-wing 2 6w comprises a columnar member 2 6b extended up and down, and a distributing wing 26a which is disposed at the columnar member 26b in an eccentric manner and is formed like an oval in a crosssection.<br>
Using the various embodiments of the swing-wing, the left-side, the center and the right-side concentrated cooling can be achieved. Fig.13 shows the condition of the left-side concentrated cooling, Fig.14 shows the central concentrated<br>
cooling, and Fig.15 shows the right-side concentrated cooling. The concentrated cooling can be achieved by aiming the air flow toward a predetermined direction under the command of the control system, as well as the abovementioned three directions.<br>
To determine the direction of the concentrated cooling, a right space or first temperature sensor 52 is installed at the upper central portion of the right wall of the refrigerating compartment 3 and a left space or second temperature sensor 53 is installed at the lower central portion of the left wall of the refrigerating compartment 3 as shown in Fig.5. The temperature sensors 52,53 as well as the position sensing switch 32 (Fig.6) is connected to a control member 54 as shown in Fig.16. Further, the motor 28 for rotating the swing-wing 26 is connected to the control member 54. These components can detect the temperature variance in the refrigerating compartment to achieve the effective concentrated cooling.<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates the state of the operation of the position sensing switch 32 which determines the datum position of the swing-wing 26, and the protuberance 33 which is contactedly rotated against the position sensing switch 32. The protuberance 33 rotates in the arrow direction together with swing-wing 26 so as to be operated as shown in Figs.17A,17B,17C.    Fig.l7C  shows  the  moment  that  the<br>
electrical point of the position sensing switch 32 is released, which regards the datum position of the swing-wing in the embodiment. The protuberance of the contacting portion to the position sensing switch is configurated in a smooth rounded manner for preventing any noise generated by the sudden release of the switch.<br>
The operation of the above structural refrigerator will now be explained with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
First, the compressor 11 and the evaporator 12 are operated in Fig.4 and the cool air is generated by the heat-~ exchange with the circumference of the evaporator" 12. The cool air is moved into the freezing 2 and the refrigerating compartment 3 by the fan 3 along the arrow. Depending on the temperature of the refrigerating compartment 3 the shutting/opening operation of the baffle plate 19 (Fig.8) is controlled. As the baffle plate 19 is opened, the cool air from the evaporator 12 is fed into the air passage 18 as shown in Fig.9A, and the air is divided into the right and the left side of the upper portion of the air distributing apparatus 17. A part of the cool air is discharged into the third compartment 9 through the air discharge opening 2 3 (Fig.5), while most of the cool air is discharged into the refrigerating 3 and the vegetable compartment 10 after flowing along the first 35 and the second duct 36.<br>
In Figs 9A and 9B, the air along the ducts 35,36 is<br>
guided by the respective branch ducts 37,38 so as to be discharged through the openinga 16 in seguence from the upper to the lower. Further, the air through the openings is distributed to the right or the left side direction by the rotation of the swing-wing 26. Even without the swing-wing 26, since the opening 16 comprises the first 39 and the second discharging portion 40, in which the one discharging portion is located over the other discharging portion and the respective discharging portions are eccentrically formed to the center line of the opening 16 to receive the air, then "the air can be distributed to the right or the left side direction. Further, adding the swing-wing more effective distribution of the air can be acquired, which generates the even cooling of the refrigerating compartment. In the embodiment, the swing-wing 26 is operated by a geared motor in a constant speed, in which the rotating speed is 6 to 10 rpm. The geared motor can also be substituted by a stepping motor which has a variable rotating speed if so desired.<br>
In more detail, the air through the respective discharging portions is blown in a different direction with each other and is smoothly distributed in the refrigerating compartment. For instance, the air guided toward the first discharging portion 39A is aimed toward the left side of Fig.9B, whereas the air guided toward the second discharging portion 40A is aimed toward the right side of Fig.9B.<br>
Further, at the adjacent opening 16B, the position of the discharging portions 39B,40B is. reversed with respect to that of the discharging portions 39A,40A. Although the earlier flowing-down air along the ducts 35,36 has a relative higher temperature, at the upper opening 16A, the air having a relative lower temperature than that of the left side 38A is flowed from the right side 37A. Contrarily, at the middle opening 16B, the air having a relative lower temperature than that of the right side 37B is flowed from the left side 38B. Next, at-the lower opening 16C, as the upper opening 16A the air having a relative lower temperature than that of the left side 38C is flowed from the right side 37C. Thus, a uniform temperature in the refrigerating compartment is accomplished to eliminate the temperature deviation of the right and the left side in the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Because the middle shoulder 372 is outwardly extended more than the upper shoulder 371, and the lower shoulder 37 3 is outwardly extended more than the middle shoulder 372, even the discharged air which passes the upper branch ducts 37A,38A is a relatively hot air, so more volume of the air is discharged through the middle branch ducts 37B,38B with respect to the air volume through the upper branch ducts 37A,38A. Also, more volume of the air is discharged through the lower branch ducts 37C,38C with respect to the air volume through the middle branch ducts 37B,38B. Therefore, the<br>
temperature deviation with respect to the height of the refrigerating compartment ~ is diminished, thereby accomplishing the uniform cooling covering from the upper portion through the lower portion of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Even when in the elimination or the stationary state of the swing-wing, the air can be distributedly discharged and can be volumetrically controlled. Further, when in the rotation of the swing-wing, more effective distribution can be accomplished to achieve a higher quality of uniform' cooling.<br>
However, in the specified area, if too much foodstuffs are placed "or a relatively hot food is disposed, the balance state of uniform cooling is disrupted, and even when in the rotation of the swing-wing, it creates a difficulty in uniform cooling. To solve the problem, the concentrated cooling to the specified area needs to be employed. The operation of the concentrated cooling will be explained with reference to Figs.13,14 and 15.<br>
Next, when the concentrated cooling is required for the left side, the swing-wing 26 is temporarily fixed toward the left direction so that the major part of the cool air flow is headed toward the left side as shown in Fig. 13. The respective air flow from the upper 371, the middle 372 and the lower wing set 373 is discharged in the left direction<br>
within 90°C with each other. Further, when the concentrated cooling is required to the center area, the swing-wing 26 is temporarily fixed in the central direction so that the major part of the cool air~flow is headed toward the central area as shown in Fig. 14. The respective air flow from the upper 371, the middle 372 and the lower wing set 373 is discharged in the center direction within 90°C with each other. Furthermore, when the concentrated cooling is required for the right side, the swing-wing 26 is temporarily fixed toward the right direction so that the major part of the cool air flow is headed toward the right side as shown in Fig. 15. The respective air flow from the upper 371, the middle 372 and the lower wing set 373 is discharged in the right direction within 90°C with each other.<br>
The rotation degree of the swing-wing 26 is controlled by the control member 54 and the position sensing switch 32 which is "on/off"ed by the protuberance 33 of the swing-wing 26. In the embodiment, the time when the protuberance 33 is contactedly released from the position sensing switch 32 is set as the datum time (Fig.l7C). The control member 54 checks the period of the rotation of the swing-wing, thereby producing the degree of the rotation. For example, assuming that the rotation speed of the swing-wing 26 is 6 rpm, the swing-wing 26 rotates during 10 seconds from the datum point, thereby rotating one turn.<br>
Referring to Fig. 18 illustrating the even cooling and the concentrated cooling according to a control method of the invention, it is firstly judged at step 61 whether the temperature is higher than a previous set temperature in a refrigerating compartment, but at that time the temperature deviation is usually 2°C in this embodiment. In order to calculate the temperature deviation, this embodiment comprises a right space temperature sensor 52 mounted on the right upper center of the refrigerating compartment 3 and a left spage temperature sensor 52 mounted on the left lower center of the refrigerating compartment 3 which are separated at an optimum distance from each other so as to detect the temperatures accurately, in which the difference between the temperatures detected by two sensors is called "a temperature deviation". Of course, it will be more preferable to obtain the temperature deviation which is the difference between the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature detected by using a plurality of sensors.<br>
Subsequently, if the temperature deviation Td is smaller than the set deviation temperature Ts, control processes step 62 that the average temperature is computed from the temperatures detected by the right space temperature sensor 52 and the left space temperature sensor 53, and then it is determined whether the average temperature Ta is higher than the datum temperature Tr. If the average temperature Ta is<br>
higher than the datum temperature Tr, step 62 proceeds to step 63 to turn on a driving- motor 28 for operating the swing-wing 2 6. On the contrary, if the average temperature Ta is lower than the datum temperature Td, step 62 goes to step 64 to turn off the driving motor 28 for stopping the operation of the swing-wing 26. Herein, the datum temperature is determined at around 3°C which is maintained for the proper storage, of foodstuffs in the refrigerating compartment 3. Therefore, it is noted that the conditions of the temperature deviation below the set deviation temperature and the average temperature below the datum temperature are caused by the uniform cooling of the invention.<br>
On the other hand, if the temperature deviation Td is higher than the set deviation temperature Ts at step 61, control processes routine 65 to perform the concentrated cooling. In other words, it is determined at step 66 whether the detected temperature of the right space temperature sensor 52 is lower than the detected temperature of the left space temperature sensor 53. If the right sensor's temperature Tl is higher than the left sensor's temperature T2, control processes step 67 to perform the right concentrated cooling. On the contrary, it is determined at step 68 whether the left sensor's temperature T2 is higher than the right sensor's temperature Tl, control processes step 69 to perform the left concentrated cooling.<br>
Herein, the left concentrated cooling is performed by adjusting the positional angle of the swing-wing so as to force the main flow of cooling air to be concentrated toward the left side. For example, if the swing-wing 2 6 is rotated at the constant speed of 6 RPM, when the swing-wing 26 is rotated for a period of 1.25 second starting from the datum time point, it is rotated by 45° to perform the left concentrated cooling. Then, it is determined at step 68 whether the right sensor's temperature Tl is higher than the left sensor's temperature T2, it returns to step 61.-Similarly, during the right concentrated cooling the swing-wing 26 is rotated for a time period of 3.75 second starting from the datum time point then to perform the right concentrated cooling.<br>
In spite that the performing of the right or left concentrated cooling is continued for a predetermined period, when the temperature deviation is over the set deviation temperature, the concentrated cooling continues to be performed in the trial and error manner that the area requiring the concentrated cooling is detected and the positional angle of the swing-wing 26 is adjusted. For example, if the temperature deviation is higher than the set deviation temperature, and the right sensor's temperature is higher than the left sensor's temperature, the swing-wing 26 is rotated for a predetermined period to detect the area<br>
required for the concentrated cooling, thereafter performing the concentration cooling, again. The numerous performances of the left or right concentrated cooling belongs to the scope of this invention. The initial concentrated cooling may be focused on the area of the sensor detecting the higher temperature, or on the arbitrary area, i.e. the area spacedly before the area to be called for the concentrated cooling.<br>
As described in detail above, a refrigerator according to this invention can achieve uniform refrigeration because the cool air introduced to the cool air duct is evenly distributed throughout the refrigerating compartment because of the design of the rear plate and the arrangement of the cool air discharge openings. The uniform refrigeration can be done more effectively by means of the swing-wings which disperse the discharged cool air.<br>
In the case that there is any temperature deviation in the compartment, the area with a relatively high temperature can receive the concentrating cooling for some period until the uniform temperature is reached. Accordingly, this invention possesses the advantage of achieving the concentrating cooling in any case.<br>
Further, the housing of this invention has a compact and slim structure because the cool air passages are formed at both sides of the cool air discharge openings and the swing-wings are placed just in the cool air discharge openings, so<br>
that the reduction of the storing space is prevented.<br>
The assembling and disassembling of this invention are very easy because this invention consists of several parts capable of being assembled and disassembled in the housing such as the motor, the indoor lamps, and the swing-wings.<br>
The rotating vanes consist of a two-piece structure, so molding process is easy and replacement is convenient.<br>
Also, motor trouble can be prevented because the motor is placed on the swing-wings and the indoor lamps are mounted near the motor, so that the motor is free from moisture penetration.<br>
In addition, even if the swing-wings rotate slowly, with the assistance of the vane portions of plate-type positioned at the cool air discharge openings, the cool air is discharged toward the compartment without flowing down along the cool air passages.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
