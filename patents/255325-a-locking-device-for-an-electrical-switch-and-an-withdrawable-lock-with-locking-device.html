Description<br>
Locking device and withdrawable rack with a locking device<br>
The invention is in the field of electrical switches and<br>
relates to a locking device for an electrical switch, which is<br>
guided displaceably in a withdrawable rack by means of an<br>
actuating shaft and which, with the switch located in a<br>
preferred position, in particular an isolating position, can be<br>
moved from a release position, in which the switch is<br>
displaceable in the withdrawable rack, into a locking position,<br>
the locking device in the locking position blocking a<br>
displacement of the switch in the withdrawable rack in a<br>
predetermined direction, and the actuating shaft being capable<br>
of being actuated via an actuating crank.<br>
The invention also relates to a withdrawable rack with such a<br>
locking device.<br>
A locking device of the generic type and a withdrawable rack of<br>
the generic type are known, for example, from the document<br>
EP 0 842 556 B1.<br>
Starting from this known locking device, the invention is based<br>
on the object of designing the locking of the switch in its<br>
preferred position to be even more reliable.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by virtue of<br>
the fact that the locking device can only be moved into the<br>
locking position if the actuating crank is blocked<br><br>
against actuation. Such a design also prevents the actuation of<br>
the actuating crank. In an advantageous manner, the risk of<br>
damage to the mechanism of the locking device owing to the high<br>
leverage forces which act on the actuating shaft via the<br>
actuating crank is thus eliminated.<br>
One preferred configuration of the novel locking device<br>
provides for a means for querying the position of the switch to<br>
be provided which, with the switch located in the preferred<br>
position, can only be moved from an open position into a<br>
blocking position if the actuating crank is blocked against<br>
actuation.<br>
In a further preferred configuration, the locking device has<br>
the following elements:<br>
-	a means for blocking the actuating shaft, which means is<br>
coupled to the means for querying the position of the switch,<br>
in order to block the displacement of the switch,<br>
-	an actuating element (blocking slide), which can be moved<br>
from a free position into a blocking position, in order to<br>
block the actuation of the actuating crank,<br>
-	a sensing means, which can be moved from a first position,<br>
which corresponds to the blocking position of the blocking<br>
slide, into a second position, which corresponds to the free<br>
position of the blocking slide, in order to sense the position<br>
of the blocking slide, and<br>
-	a first blocking means, which is coupled to the sensing means<br>
by means of a coupling section, in order to block the means for<br>
querying the position of the switch,<br>
the first blocking means only releasing the means for<br>
querying the position of the switch such that it can be moved<br>
into its blocking position if the blocking slide is located in<br>
its blocking position.<br><br>
In a further configuration, provision is made for the sensing<br>
means to be mounted on a carriage which can be displaced by<br>
means of the switch.<br>
Furthermore, a restraining means can advantageously be provided<br>
which, with the switch removed from the withdrawable rack,<br>
keeps the sensing means in its first position, which<br>
corresponds to the blocking position of the blocking slide.<br>
It is advantageous if the means for querying the position of<br>
the switch can be stopped in its blocking position. A locking<br>
cylinder, which is coupled to the means for querying the<br>
position of the switch by means of a cable pull, is preferably<br>
used for this purpose.<br>
In order, when the switch has been removed once from the<br>
withdrawable rack, to prevent a switch from being inserted into<br>
the withdrawable rack again, a second blocking means is<br>
provided which, with the means for querying the position of the<br>
switch stopped in its blocking position and once the switch has<br>
been removed from the withdrawable rack, pivots into the<br>
movement path of the switch which points in the direction of<br>
the preferred position.<br>
The novel locking device is preferably associated with the<br>
withdrawable rack and, for this purpose, is arranged beneath<br>
the electrical switch on the withdrawable rack, in particular<br>
by means of a bearing plate.<br>
A locking device designed in accordance with the invention is<br>
illustrated in figures 1 to 11, in which:<br><br>
figure 1 shows a front side of a switchgear cell with a<br>
withdrawable rack in which a low-voltage circuit<br>
breaker is arranged,<br>
figure 2 shows a traveling drive of the low-voltage circuit<br>
breaker with a view of an actuating crank, which has<br>
been plugged onto an actuating shaft and can be<br>
blocked by means of an actuating element (blocking<br>
slide),<br>
figure 3 shows the traveling drive shown in figure 2 with a<br>
view of a blocking pawl, by means of which the<br>
actuating shaft can be stopped,<br>
figure 4 shows a perspective illustration of the withdrawable<br>
rack with the locking device according to the<br>
invention which is arranged beneath the low-voltage<br>
circuit breaker on the bottom of the withdrawable<br>
rack,<br>
figure 5 shows a plan view of the locking device according to<br>
the invention,<br>
figure 6 shows the locking device according to the invention<br>
with a view of its underside,<br>
figure 7 shows the withdrawable rack with the locking device<br>
in an unlocked first position with the switch<br>
removed from the withdrawable rack,<br>
figures 8 to 11 show further characteristic positions of the<br>
locking device, and<br>
figure 12 shows a particular configuration of a means for<br>
blocking the actuating shaft.<br>
As shown in figure 1, a withdrawable rack 1 is arranged in a<br>
switchgear cell of a switchgear cabinet or a switchgear<br>
assembly, a low-voltage circuit breaker 2 being arranged<br>
displaceably in a known manner in the withdrawable rack 1. The<br>
low-voltage circuit breaker 2, which has<br><br>
been inserted in the withdrawable rack 1, has a housing 3 for<br>
accommodating a switching pole assembly and a control panel 4,<br>
which is fixed to the front side of the housing 3 and forms the<br>
front side of the switch and by means of which a switching<br>
drive and further parts of the switch are covered. An<br>
overcurrent release 5, control and display elements 6 to 10, a<br>
manually operated winding lever 11 for tensioning a spring<br>
energy store of the switching drive and an actuating crank 13,<br>
which can be lowered into an accommodating pocket 12, for<br>
actuating an actuating shaft 14 of a traveling drive 15 are<br>
arranged on the control panel 4.<br>
As shown in figure 2, the traveling drive 15 has a housing 16,<br>
which can expediently comprise two shell-like halves, between<br>
which gear mechanism parts and further components are arranged.<br>
A rotary movement exerted by means of the actuating crank 13 is<br>
converted into a rotation of a traveling shaft 17 by means of<br>
the actuating shaft 14. For this purpose, a worm is arranged on<br>
the actuating shaft 14, which worm is in engagement with a<br>
gearwheel. The longitudinal axes of the actuating shaft 14 and<br>
the traveling shaft 17 are at right angles with respect to one<br>
another. The traveling shaft 17 is not fixedly connected to the<br>
traveling drive 15, but is displaceable in a profiled opening<br>
20 of the gearwheel which is matched to the profile of the<br>
traveling shaft 17. In this way, the traveling drive 15 can be<br>
used for circuit breakers of different sizes and is not tied to<br>
a specific position along the traveling shaft 17. Traveling<br>
cranks 21 (cf. figure 4) are fitted in a known manner to the<br>
ends of the traveling shaft 17, which traveling cranks 21<br>
interact with stationary parts, for example in the way shown<br>
schematically in DE 44 20 580 C1 or DE 44 20 581 C1 (in each<br>
case in figure 1) . Likewise not illustrated is the fixing of<br>
the traveling drive 15 to a circuit breaker, since this is well<br>
known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
As has already been mentioned, an actuating crank 13 is used<br>
for rotating the actuating shaft 14 which is mounted in the<br>
housing 16, which actuating crank 13, in contrast to the other<br>
known traveling drives (cf. DE 44 20 580 C1 and<br>
DE 44 2 0 581 C1, mentioned) , cannot be removed from the<br>
actuating shaft 14, but is part of the traveling drive 15. The<br>
actuating crank 13 has a hollow shank 22, which is coupled in a<br>
rotationally locked fashion to a free end of the actuating<br>
shaft 14 and can be displaced on the actuating shaft 14.<br>
The hollow shank 22 bears a guide pin 25, which engages in a<br>
guide groove 26 provided on the housing 16. Since the guide<br>
groove 26 is matched to the guide pin 25, the shank 22 can be<br>
displaced along the guide groove 26, but without any<br>
possibility of rotation. This is only enabled when the shank 22<br>
has been pulled out completely towards the front, where the<br>
guide groove 2 6 opens out into an annular groove in the housing<br>
16. "Annular groove" is in this context understood to mean<br>
differently shaped cutouts of the housing 16 which make free<br>
rotation of the shank 22 possible.<br>
In addition to the shank 22, the actuating crank 13 comprises a<br>
crank arm 27, which is connected to the shank 22 (or is<br>
produced integrally with said shank) and at whose end an<br>
opening for accommodating a grip piece 28 is located. The grip<br>
piece 28 can be displaced in the mentioned opening in the<br>
direction of an arrow 29 parallel to the shank 22 and can be<br>
moved from the inserted rest position shown in figure 3 into a<br>
withdrawn working position by the user.<br>
In the rest position, the actuating crank 13 therefore needs to<br>
be accommodated in the accommodating pocket 12 such that it is<br>
lowered so as to be flush. The accommodating pocket 12 belongs<br>
to a control panel insert 3 0 (cf.<br><br>
figures 1 and 2) , which is arranged on the lower edge of the<br>
control panel 4 of the circuit breaker 2. When the actuating<br>
crank 13 is inserted into its rest position, an end face 31<br>
(cf. figure 3) at the end of the shank 22 comes to bear against<br>
a supporting ring 32, which is loaded by a stop spring 33. The<br>
stop spring 33 is a helical compression spring, which rests on<br>
the actuating shaft 14. Then, the user pushes the grip piece 28<br>
through the opening located in the crank arm 27 until it is in<br>
a position which is flush with the crank arm 27. The inner end<br>
of the grip piece 28 then bears against a stop 34.<br>
In this inserted rest position, the user in fact has no<br>
possible way of gripping the crank arm because the contour of<br>
the accommodating pocket 12 is matched to the crank arm 2 7 with<br>
the shank 22 and the grip piece 28. Nevertheless, if required<br>
quick access is ensured. This takes place by virtue of the fact<br>
that the depth of the accommodating pocket is dimensioned such<br>
that it is larger by a certain extent than is required to<br>
accommodate said parts. The user can therefore push the crank<br>
arm 27 slightly into the accommodating pocket, counter to the<br>
force of the stop spring 33. However, the grip piece 28, owing<br>
to the fact that it bears against the fixed stop 34, cannot<br>
take part in this movement and now protrudes from the crank arm<br>
27	by the same amount. The user can now pull out the grip piece<br>
28	and then the crank arm 27 with the shank 22.<br>
In a similar way to in the case of known traveling drives,<br>
arranged alongside the actuating crank 13 is a display window<br>
24, in which a display means 35 for the operational position of<br>
the circuit breaker in its withdrawable rack can be seen. These<br>
positions - operating position, test position and isolating<br>
position - relate in a known manner to the relative<br><br>
positions of movable main isolating contacts and auxiliary<br>
isolating contacts and therefore, with a given arrangement of<br>
these isolating contacts, to the position of the circuit<br>
breaker 2 in the associated withdrawable rack 1. Owing to the<br>
fact that the traveling cranks 21 (cf. figure 4) at the ends of<br>
the traveling shaft 17 engage in a stationary guide of the<br>
withdrawable rack 1, the angular position of the gearwheel<br>
therefore forms a reliable feature for the mentioned positions.<br>
For the purposes of the display device, a control cam is<br>
therefore arranged at an end side of the gearwheel (not shown),<br>
against which control cam a sensing pin of a two-armed display<br>
lever 38 bears under the action of a tension spring 39. The<br>
display lever 38, which can be pivoted about a bearing screw<br>
40, therefore moves the control cam into a position of the<br>
display means 35 which can be perceived by the user in the<br>
display window 24 (cf. figure 2). It is essential here that the<br>
user, when actuating the actuating crank 13, can easily<br>
identify when the mentioned positions have been reached. For<br>
this purpose, the control cam is provided with sections having<br>
different slopes, which are designed such that the display<br>
means 35 assumes an intermediate position in each case shortly<br>
after one of the mentioned positions has been left and then<br>
indicates the following position shortly before this position<br>
is reached. Owing to the bearing screw 4 0 of the display lever<br>
38 which is positioned relatively close to the control cam,<br>
relatively small deflections are converted into easily visible<br>
movements of the display means 35 in the display window 24.<br>
Owing to a latching slide 41, which is loaded by means of a<br>
prestressing spring, the shank 22 is protected against being<br>
unintentionally inserted into the housing 16. The latching<br>
slide 41 is guided in the front part of the housing 16 and<br>
likewise<br><br>
interacts with the end face 31 at the inner end of the shank<br>
22. When the shank 22 is pulled out into its working position,<br>
the latching slide 41 springs behind the end face 31 and<br>
therefore blocks the insertion of the shank 22. In order to<br>
release the shank 22 such that it can be inserted, an actuating<br>
tab 43 is available to the user which is arranged such that it<br>
protrudes into the accommodating pocket 12 and therefore is<br>
only accessible when the actuating crank 13 has been pulled<br>
out.<br>
The latching slide 41 has an additional function in the central<br>
position (test position) of the traveling drive 15. In contrast<br>
to the operating position and isolating position, this does not<br>
manifest itself for the user by a noticeable resistance at the<br>
actuating crank owing to end stops having been reached. In<br>
order that, nevertheless, the user can insert the actuating<br>
crank 13 only when the test position has been reached<br>
precisely, the latching slide 41 is provided with a tongue 44,<br>
which emerges laterally at the housing 16 if the actuating tab<br>
43 is operated and a window opening 3 8a, which is arranged in<br>
the display lever 38, is opposite the tongue 44.<br>
In order to deny the user access to the actuating crank 13,<br>
when the crank arm 2 7 has been lowered into the accommodating<br>
pocket 12, the shank 22 of the actuating shaft can be fixed<br>
axially by a first blocking mechanism. This takes place owing<br>
to a first blocking element in the form of a blocking lever 45<br>
in conjunction with a blocking groove 46, which is arranged in<br>
the shank 22 of the actuating crank and is delimited in the<br>
axial direction of the switch. In this case, the blocking lever<br>
45 is correspondingly connected to a first actuating element in<br>
the form of a blocking slide 47, as is described in<br>
DE 44 20 580 C1. If the preconditions exist for the traveling<br>
drive 15<br><br>
to be capable of being actuated without any risk to the user,<br>
the blocking lever 45 is lifted by the blocking slide 47<br>
corresponding to an arrow 4 7a shown in figure 1, a blocking tab<br>
48 of the blocking lever 45 being pulled out of the blocking<br>
groove 46 of the shank 22. Conversely, it is only possible to<br>
switch the circuit breaker 2 on when the actuating crank 13 has<br>
again been inserted into its rest position in the accommodating<br>
pocket 12 and therefore the blocking tab 4 8 on the blocking<br>
lever 4 5 can again enter the blocking groove 46.<br>
As shown in figure 3, the traveling drive 15 has a second<br>
blocking mechanism for blocking the actuation of the actuating<br>
shaft 14. This second blocking mechanism serves the purpose of<br>
preventing a displacement of the switch in the withdrawable<br>
rack by means of cylinder locks 49, 50. This second blocking<br>
mechanism also fixes the shank 22 of the actuating crank 13 in<br>
its axial direction 24 if the second blocking mechanism is<br>
activated in blocking fashion and if the crank arm 27 of the<br>
actuating crank has been lowered into the accommodating pocket<br>
12. This takes place by means of a second blocking element, in<br>
the form of a blocking pawl 52, in conjunction with a second<br>
blocking groove 53, which is arranged in the shank 22 of the<br>
actuating crank and is likewise delimited in the axial<br>
direction 24 of the shank 22. The blocking pawl 52 is in the<br>
form of a stamped metal part and is guided displaceably on stop<br>
faces on the traveling drive in the direction of the arrow 54<br>
at right angles to the shank 22. In addition to a blocking tab<br>
55, which is integrally formed on the side facing the shank 22,<br>
it has a window-like opening 56, from one of whose inner walls<br>
a first retaining pin 57, which runs parallel to the<br>
displacement direction 54 of the blocking pawl, for a<br>
pretensioning spring 58 is integrally formed. A first arm 59 of<br>
a second actuating element 60, which is held on the traveling<br>
drive displaceably in the displacement direction 54 of the<br>
blocking pawl,<br><br>
protrudes into the window-like opening 56 of the blocking pawl<br>
52. A cylindrical pin 61, which passes through inner walls,<br>
which run at right angles to the displacement direction 54, of<br>
the actuating element 60 and fixing lugs (opposite these walls)<br>
of the traveling drive in the region of corresponding through-<br>
holes, is used for holding this second actuating element 60 on<br>
the traveling drive 15. In order to axially fix the inserted<br>
pin, the pin has a tapered section 62, into which a sprung tab<br>
63 of the actuating element 60 snaps. In order to dismantle the<br>
actuating element 60, this tab 63 can be lifted out of the<br>
tapered section 62 of the pin 61 by means of a screwdriver or a<br>
comparably narrow tool and the pin can therefore be released<br>
such that it can be pulled out.<br>
A second retaining pin 64 for the pretensioning spring 58 is<br>
integrally formed on the first arm 59 of the second actuating<br>
element 60. A second arm 65 of the actuating element 60, under<br>
the force of a resetting spring 66, which is supported on a<br>
first supporting face 61 of one of the housing halves of the<br>
traveling drive, bears against a second supporting face 68 of<br>
this housing half. In order to guide the resetting spring 66,<br>
one supporting face 67 and the actuating element 60 are<br>
provided with in each case one retaining pin 69, 70. A first<br>
cylinder lock 49 (illustrated schematically) is used for<br>
controlling the actuating element 60. When this first cylinder<br>
lock 49 is closed, a tab (not illustrated) acts in the<br>
direction of the arrow 71 on the second arm 65 and displaces<br>
the actuating element 60 and the blocking pawl 52, which is<br>
coupled to the actuating element 60 via the pretensioning<br>
spring 58, counter to the force of the resetting spring 66 from<br>
an OFF position into an ON position in the direction of the<br>
shank 22 of the actuating crank. When the shank 22 has been<br>
inserted completely, i.e. when<br><br>
the crank arm 27 has been lowered into its accommodating<br>
pocket, the second blocking groove 53 of the shank 22 is<br>
opposite the blocking tab 55 of the blocking pawl 52, with the<br>
result that said blocking tab 55 can enter the blocking groove<br>
53. When attempting to pull the crank arm 27 out of the<br>
accommodating pocket 12, one side face of the blocking groove<br>
53 comes to bear against a stop face 72 of the blocking tab 55<br>
and therefore indicates to the operating personnel that<br>
blocking of the traveling drive is taking place. In this case,<br>
even a slight resistance is sufficient for indicating blocking<br>
of the traveling drive. The second actuating element 60, in<br>
contrast to the first actuating element 47 (blocking slide) of<br>
the first blocking mechanism, can be displaced from its OFF<br>
position into its ON position even when the crank arm 27 has<br>
not or has not yet been completely lowered into the<br>
accommodating pocket 12. With the shank 22 completely pulled<br>
out, the blocking pawl 52 is likewise raised when the actuating<br>
element 60 is raised and therefore protrudes into the movement<br>
path of the shank 22. When the shank is pushed in, the end face<br>
31 of the shank 22 slides over a sliding face 73 of the<br>
blocking tab 55 of the blocking pawl and pushes the blocking<br>
pawl 52, counter to the force of the pretensioning spring 58,<br>
out of the movement path of the shank. Then, the blocking tab<br>
55 slides along a flattened outer section 74 of the shank until<br>
it latches into the blocking groove 53.<br>
For the alternative actuation of the blocking pawl 52, the<br>
second actuating element is coupled to a third actuating<br>
element 75 in the form of a two-armed lever. For the coupling<br>
process, the second actuating element 60 has a U-shaped cutout<br>
76 at the free end of its first arm 59, a first arm 77 of the<br>
two-armed lever engaging in said cutout 76. This two-armed<br>
lever is capable of rotating about a stationary bearing screw<br>
(not illustrated), which passes through a hole 78<br><br>
of the third actuating element 75. The second lever arm 79 of<br>
the third actuating element 75 can be actuated by means of a<br>
pawl of the cylinder lock 50 in the direction of the arrow 80.<br>
As shown in figure 4, the locking device 81 according to the<br>
invention is fixed beneath the low-voltage circuit breaker 2 to<br>
the bottom of the withdrawable rack 1.<br>
As shown in figures 5 and 6, the locking device 81 has a<br>
bearing plate 82, which, on one side, with a bent-back portion<br>
(not visible in the figures) passes through the bottom 83 of<br>
the withdrawable rack and which, on its opposite side, is fixed<br>
to the bottom 83 of the withdrawable rack by means of a fixing<br>
means 84 in the form of a screw. The bearing plate 82 has<br>
supporting faces 86, 87, 88, which are bent back at right<br>
angles to its bottom face 85 and are used for holding and<br>
guiding further elements of the locking device.<br>
For example, two hexagon bolts 89, 90 are mounted in rotatable<br>
fashion on a first bent-back supporting face 86 and a second<br>
bent-back supporting face 87, in each case one lever 91, 92<br>
being held such that it is fixed against rotation on said<br>
hexagon bolts 89, 90. The two levers 91, 92 are connected by<br>
means of a rod assembly 93. A cable pull 94, which can be<br>
actuated by means of a further cylinder lock 95, acts on one<br>
lever 91. The rod assembly 93 is loaded by a second resetting<br>
spring 96, which holds the two levers 91, 92 and therefore the<br>
two bolts 89, 90 in a rest position when the cylinder lock 95<br>
is unlocked.<br>
While a means 97 for querying the position of the switch in the<br>
form of two stop levers is held such that it is fixed against<br>
rotation on one of the hexagon bolts 89, the other of the two<br>
levers 92 is provided with a means 98 for blocking the<br>
actuating<br><br>
shaft 14 in the form of a cam disk. In this case, the cam disk<br>
acts in the direction of the arrow 71 on the second arm 65 of<br>
the second actuating element 60 (cf. figure 3) . The means 97<br>
for querying the position of the switch and the means 98 for<br>
blocking the actuating shaft 14 in an open position, which<br>
corresponds to the unactuated OFF position of the second<br>
actuating element 60, are located in the rest position of the<br>
rod assembly 93.<br>
A carriage 99, which is bent in the form of a U, is held<br>
displaceably on the third bent-back supporting face 88. For<br>
this purpose, the third supporting face 8 8 is provided with a<br>
slot 100 (cf. figure 7), in which two bolts 101, 102, which are<br>
connected to the carriage 99, are guided displaceably. In this<br>
case, one of the two bolts 101 passes through the two lateral<br>
guide faces 103, 104, which run parallel to the third<br>
supporting face, of the carriage, which is bent in the form of<br>
a U. A restraining means 105 in the form of a two-armed lever<br>
is mounted pivotably on this bolt 101. In this case, one lever<br>
arm 106 extends in the form of a bent-back portion which runs<br>
parallel to the guide faces of the carriage bent in the form of<br>
a U (cf. figure 8) in the direction of a rear wall 107 of the<br>
withdrawable rack 1 (cf. figure 4). The second lever arm 108,<br>
which extends in the direction of the open side 109<br>
(cf. figure 4) of the withdrawable rack 1 in a plane which runs<br>
substantially parallel to the bottom 110 of the carriage bent<br>
in the form of a U has a bent-back portion 111, which points in<br>
the direction of the bottom 110, at its free end<br>
(cf. figure 8). Two bearing arms 112, 113 (cf. figure 8), which<br>
run parallel to the guide faces of the carriage bent in the<br>
form of a U and have a distance from one another such that the<br>
outer width of the restraining means is matched to the inner<br>
width of the carriage bent in the form of a U, are used for<br>
pivotably mounting the restraining means 105 on the bolt<br><br>
101. A third resetting spring 114 in the form of a helical<br>
compression spring is supported between the bottom 110 of the<br>
carriage 99 and the free end of the first lever arm 106. The<br>
second 102 of the bolts acts as a first abutment for a fourth<br>
resetting spring 115, which is in the form of a tension spring<br>
and whose second abutment is formed by a pin 116. In this case,<br>
the pin 116 protrudes away from the outwardly pointing, third<br>
supporting face 88, mounted in front of the first bolt 101 in<br>
the insertion direction 117. The guide face 103, which is<br>
opposite this third supporting face 88, of the carriage 99 bent<br>
in the form of a U has a tab 118, which protrudes into the<br>
movement path of the low-voltage circuit breaker 2 and is used<br>
for guiding the carriage 99 along with the switch when a<br>
specific insertion position is reached.<br>
A sensing means 119 in the form of a further two-armed lever is<br>
mounted pivotably on the first bolt 101 between the carriage 99<br>
and the restraining means 105. This sensing means 119 serves<br>
the purpose of sensing the position of the actuating element 47<br>
(of the blocking slide). Two guide slits 120, 121 are used for<br>
axially positioning the sensing element 119, of which guide<br>
slits a first 120 is provided in a rear bent-back portion 122<br>
of the carriage 99 and the second 121 is provided in the second<br>
lever arm 108 of the restraining means 105 and in the bent-back<br>
portion 111 thereof. While the upwardly pointing edge of the<br>
end of one lever arm 123 of the sensing means 119 is opposite<br>
an actuating face 124 (cf. figure 9) of the first actuating<br>
element 47 (blocking slide), a bow 126 of a lever mechanism 127<br>
bears against the upwardly pointing edge of the free end of the<br>
other lever arm 125. A first blocking means 128 in the form of<br>
a blocking flap, which is bent in the form of a U, is held such<br>
that it is fixed against rotation on the lever mechanism 127.<br>
The blocking flap is held by a fifth resetting spring 129 in a<br>
rest<br><br>
position, in which it covers the two stop levers which form the<br>
means for querying the position of the switch 97 and, as a<br>
result, holds them in their open position (cf. figure 9).<br>
The hexagon bolt 8 9 bears, in addition to the means 97 for<br>
querying the position of the switch, a second blocking means<br>
13 0 in the form of a frame-like flap, which bears against<br>
retaining tabs 133, 134 of the two stop levers by means of an<br>
edge 131 under the force of a second prestressing spring 132.<br>
Figure 7 shows the locking device 81 in its unlocked release<br>
position with the switch removed from the withdrawable rack. In<br>
this case, the means 98 (cam disk) for blocking the actuating<br>
shaft 14 is located in its OFF position, and the means 97 (stop<br>
levers) for querying the position of the switch 97 is located<br>
in its open position. Owing to the fact that there is no low-<br>
voltage circuit breaker in the withdrawable rack, there is also<br>
no first actuating element (blocking slide) acting on the one<br>
lever arm 123 of the sensing means 119. In this case, the<br>
forces of the fifth resetting spring 129, which acts on the<br>
first blocking means 128 (blocking flap) , and of the third<br>
resetting spring 114 (cf. figure 5), which acts on the<br>
restraining means 105, are dimensioned such that the first<br>
lever arm 123 of the sensing means 119 is pivoted downwards<br>
into a first position corresponding to the blocking position of<br>
the first actuating element 47 (blocking slide) and the first<br>
blocking means 128 (blocking flap) is therefore pivoted upwards<br>
such that the means 97 for querying the position of the switch<br>
is released such that it can be moved into its blocking<br>
position.<br>
Figure 8 shows the locking device 81 in its locked locking<br>
position with the switch removed<br><br>
from the withdrawable rack. In contrast to the position as<br>
illustrated in figure 7, in this case the means 97 for querying<br>
the position of the switch (stop levers) is moved into its<br>
blocking position by the actuation of the cylinder lock 95. In<br>
this case, the second blocking means 130 (frame-like flap) is<br>
released by the retaining tabs 133, 134 of the stop levers and<br>
is therefore pivoted upwards such that a front edge 135<br>
protrudes into the movement path 13 6 of the switch which points<br>
in the insertion direction. Once a switch has been removed from<br>
the withdrawable rack, renewed insertion of a switch is<br>
therefore prevented when the locking device is locked. In this<br>
locking position, the means 98 for blocking the actuating shaft<br>
14 is located in a position in which the actuating element 60<br>
is raised such that the blocking pawl 52 is located in its ON<br>
position and the shank 22 is stopped in its axial direction.<br>
As an alternative to the second blocking means, a third<br>
blocking means, which is coupled to the means 97 for querying<br>
the position of the switch, can be provided such that, when the<br>
locking device is located in the locking position, removal of a<br>
switch from the withdrawable rack is also prevented. For this<br>
purpose, as shown in figure 12, a bent-back portion 138 is also<br>
provided on the means 13 7 (in the form of a cam disk) for<br>
blocking the actuating shaft, which bent-back portion 13 8 runs<br>
at right angles to the movement path of the switch and, when<br>
the switch is located in the isolating position in the<br>
withdrawable rack and the locking device is located in its<br>
locking position, is opposite a stop face 139 of the second<br>
actuating element 60 and therefore blocks removal of the<br>
switch. When the locking device is located in its locking<br>
position, the same bent-back portion 138<br><br><br>
is opposite a stop face 140 (cf. figure 3) of the housing 16 of<br>
the traveling drive 15 of a switch 1 if an attempt is made to<br>
insert the switch 1 into the withdrawable rack when the locking<br>
device is located in its locking position and therefore<br>
prevents the insertion.<br>
Figure 9 shows the locking device 81 in its release position,<br>
in which it cannot be locked since the low-voltage circuit<br>
breaker is located in an intermediate position outside of the<br>
preferred isolating position. In this intermediate position,<br>
the first actuating element 47 is in its free position, i.e. in<br>
its upwardly displaced position, since the preferred position,<br>
namely the isolating position of the switch in the withdrawable<br>
rack, has not yet been reached. The lever arm 106 of the<br>
restraining means 105 is pivoted by the inserted switch and the<br>
spring force of the third resetting spring 114 is blocked such<br>
that the first blocking means 128 and the lever arm 125 are<br>
held in their rest position under the force of the fifth<br>
resetting spring 129, in which rest position the means 97 for<br>
querying the position of the switch (stop levers) is stopped in<br>
its open position.<br>
A cam 136 is formed on the lever arm 106 of the restraining<br>
means 105 such that the sensing means 119 and the first<br>
actuating element 47 (blocking slide) are reliably associated<br>
with one another irrespective of the position of the first<br>
actuating element 47.<br>
Figure 10 shows the locking device 81 with the switch located<br>
in the isolating position in its unlocked release position, in<br>
which, however, the means 97 for querying the position of the<br>
switch is released such that it can be moved into its blocking<br>
position. This release is brought about<br><br>
by the first actuating element 47 (blocking slide) being moved<br>
into its blocking position, i.e. by the blocking slide being<br>
lowered. Such lowering of the blocking slide, as has already<br>
been explained, is only possible, however, if the crank arm 27<br>
has been recessed completely into the accommodating pocket 12<br>
and therefore an actuation of the actuating crank 13 is<br>
prevented (cf. figure 2).<br>
Figure 11 shows the locking device 81 with the switch located<br>
in the isolating position in its locking position, in which the<br>
means 97 for querying the position of the switch is moved from<br>
its open position (cf. figure 10) into its blocking position.<br>
In its blocking position, the means 97 protrudes into the<br>
movement path of the switch, with the result that a further<br>
displacement of the switch beyond its isolating position in the<br>
direction of the test and operating position is stopped.<br>
In this case too, the blocking pawl 52 is caused to move into<br>
its ON position owing to the rotation of the means 98 (cam<br>
disk) for blocking the actuating shaft, with the result that<br>
the shank 22 is stopped in its axial direction in this case,<br>
too.<br>
