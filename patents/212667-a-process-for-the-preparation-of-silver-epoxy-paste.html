				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a silver epoxy paste for hybrid microelectronics and chip bonding applications.<br>
Silver epoxy composition are based on thermosetting property of the resin system used. During curing, the cross linking of the polymer resin takes place which imparts good adhesion strength of the cured place which imparts good adhesion strength of the cured paste/print to the surface. The paste is either brushed or screen printed on a variety of substrates.<br>
The main object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of a silver epoxy composition.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a silver epoxy composition for hybrid microelectronics and chip bonding applications.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of silver epoxy paste comprising in the step of mixing 3-8% epoxy resin and 2-9% phenolic resin, crushing the mixture to powder, adding 16-26% of solvent mixture herein described to dissolve the powdered mixture, mixing 56-67% of silver powder homogenously to get the silver epoxy paste.<br>
Further according to this invention there is provided the silver epoxy composition comprises 56-67% silver powder, 3-8% epoxy resin, 2-9% phenolic resin and 16 to 26% solvent mixture mixed with each other homogeneously.<br>
In accordance with this invention 3-8% of epoxy resin is first mixed with 2-9% of phenolic resin and the mixture is crushed to powder. 16-26% of solvent mixture is added to the above mixture to dissolve the epoxy resin therein. 56-67% of silver powder is then added to the above solution and a homogenous mix is prepared to get the silver epoxy composition.<br>
The silver powder used for the preparation of silver epoxy composition is prepared by preparing a silver nitrate solution and a hydroquinone solution. The silver powder is precipitated by adding the hydroquinone solution to the silver nitrate solution in the ratio of 0.8-1.2: 4.5-5.5 slowly at a temperature of 60-70°C. The precipitate of silver powder so obtained is  washed with warm water  till it is free  of  nitrate and the precipitate is subsequently dried in vacuum oven at  30-70°C for 1 to 3 hours which is then subjected  to<br>
the  step  of milling (ball milling) to get  the  silver powder.<br>
The solvent mixture used comprises 30 to 40X by weight methylethyl ketorte, 30 to 407. by weight butyl<br>
acetate and 30 to 40% by weight butyl cellosolove mixed with each other preferably in equal proportion. The<br>
epoxy resin used has epoxide equivalent 1650—2050 available in lumps/granules of light yellow colour. The<br>
epoxy resin preferably comprises:<br>
Epichlorohydrin and Bisphenol A Derived Resin Epichlorohydrin and diphenylolpropane Resin<br>
Epoxy Creso1—Novolak Resin or Epoxy phenol—Novolak Resin<br>
The   phenolic  resin  used   is   preferably metacresol  formaldehyde phenolic resin,  ortho   cresol formaldehyde resin or phenol formaldehyde resin.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  process of   this invention  epoxy  resin is weighed  and  transferred  to<br>
stainless  steel mortar.  The phenolic resin is  weighed<br>
and added to the epoxy resin in the mortar. The Mixture is then crushed to powders. The solvent mixture is then<br>
added to the resin mixture and the mixture is allowed to settle for 5-110 minutes and the contents are then<br>
stirred so as to dissolve them. Now the silver powder is added to the mixture and a homogenous paste is<br>
prepared to get the silver epoxy composition.<br>
A  silver epoxy composition and  the  process for  the  preparation thereof according to  a  preferred embodiment  is herein described and illustrated  in  the following  examples.<br>
According to this invention silver powder  is<br>
first prepared by preparing a silver nitric solution and<br>
hydroquinone solution.  Silver powder is precipitated by<br>
adding  the hydroquinone solution to the  silver  nitric<br>
solution  in the ratio of  0.08-1.2:4.5-5.9,  slowly  at<br>
the  temperature of 60-70%.  The precipitate of  silver<br>
powder  so  obtained is washed with warm  water  and  is<br>
subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 30-70° C for 1 to 3 hours. The dried powder is then subjected to the step<br>
of ball milling to get the silver powder. 3-8% epoxy resin as mentioned herein above is mixed with 2-9%<br>
phenolic resin and is subjected to the step of crushing to obtain the powder thereon. 16-26X solvent mixture<br>
consisting of methylethyl ketone, butyl acetate and butyl cellosolove are mixed together preferably in the<br>
equal ratio, is added to the above mixture of epoxy resin, phenolic resin so as to resolve the epoxy resin<br>
therein. 56-70% of silver powder is then added to the above solution and a homogenous mix is prepared to get<br>
the silver epoxy composition.<br>
The  process  for the preparation  of  silver powder   composition  is  further  explained    in   the following examples:—<br><br>
EXAMPLE:-1<br>
0.66  grains  Epikote resin is  taken  into  a<br>
stainless  steel mortar.  0.38 grams phenolic resin  was added to said resin into the steel mortar.  The  mixture<br>
was  slowly crushed to powder.  2 grams solvent  mixture was  added  to the resin mixture into the  steel  mortar<br>
and  the solution so obtained was allowed to settle  for 9 minutes.  The contents were slowly stirred to dissolve<br>
the resins when the resins were completely dissolved the solution appeared like brown in colour.   6 grams silver<br>
powder  was  then  added to the resinous  mass  and  the mixing  was done very carefully with the  steel  pestle.<br>
The  small  lumps were crushed under  the  pestle.   The silver powder was dispersed in the resins media and  the<br>
silver  shiny paste was formed.  The mixing yielded  and uniform  and homogenous paste even the smallest  cruster<br>
of powder was dispersed and mixed, the paste adhered  to the  sides  of a water around the  pestle  was  removing<br>
using  plastic  spatula and scooped to a place  in  the water  several  times  and is mixed  again  to  get  the<br>
product  finally  homogenous.  A three roller  mill  was used  and  then  the  mixture  was  transferred  to  the<br>
g1asses/bott1es.<br>
EXAMPLE: -2<br>
1.35  grains  Epikote resin is  taken  into  a<br>
stainless  steel mortar.  0.65 grams phenolic resin  was<br>
added to said resin into the steel mortar.  The  mixture<br>
was  slowly crushed to powder.  1 gram  solvent  mixture<br>
was  added  to the resin mixture into the  steel  mortar<br>
and  the solution so obtained was allowed to settle  for 17 minutes. The contents were slowly stirred to dissolve<br>
the resins when the resins were completely dissolved the solution appeared like brown in colour.   4 grams silver<br>
powder  was  then  added to the resinous  mass and  the mixing  was done very carefully with the  steel  pestle.<br>
The  small  lumps were crushed under  the  pestle.   The silver powder was dispersed in the resins media and  the<br>
silver  shiny paste was formed.  The mixing yielded and uniform  and homogenous paste even the smallest  cruster<br>
of powder was dispersed and mixed, the paste adhered  to the  sides  of a water around the  pestle  was  removing<br>
using  plastic  spatula and scooped to a  place  in  the water  several  times  and is mixed  again  to  get  the<br>
product  finally  homogenous.  A three roller  mill  was used  and  then  the  mixture  was  transferred  to  the<br>
glasses/bottles.<br><br><br><br><br>
