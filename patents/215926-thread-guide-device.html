				<td>The present invention relates to a thread guide device for winding threads into cross-wound bobbins with two superimposed thread guide vanes which are rotatable in opposite directions and with an arcuate plate from whose contour the thread guide vanes issue and into which they dip again, the transfer of the thread taking place at the dipping points of the thread guide vanes in each case.<br>
In these known thread guide devices, also described as vane units and known, for example, from CH-A-448 835, the thread to be wound is displaced by the edge of the respective thread guide vane, which leads in the direction of movement, along the arcuate edge of the arcuate plate without the thread having to be guided in a special guide eyelet. This has the advantage over so-called thread guide units with positive thread guidance in a guide eyelet of very careful treatment of the thread. It is pointed out that the term thread in the present description denotes an elongate textile product and therefore covers not only yarns but also ribbons.<br>
A further advantage of the vane units is the high winding speed. This is permitted in that the thread guide vanes invariably rotate only in one direction and do not have to change their direction of movement. The drive of the thread guide vanes is inevitably connected to that of the bobbin shaft driving the bobbin and is effected via a transmission belt driven by a common driving motor.<br>
Unfortunately, it has not been possible hitherto to use vane units universally and, owing to their fixed stroke, in particular not for producing bobbins with bevelled end faces (so-called "pineapple" bobbins) or with soft edges. The stroke of the vane units would have to be variable for bobbins of this type, but it has not been possible hitherto to provide a practicable solution to this end.<br>
In a vane unit described in DE-A-2 108 866 with a variable stroke, the thread guide vanes consist of two arms of which the length is variable. The vane arms are adjusted by circular links in which corresponding blocks on the vane arms engage. This solution has the drawback that, at the normally very high speeds, the links as well as the blocks are subjected to pronounced wear, even when operating with a constant stroke and constant vane length.<br>
With a vane unit described in DE-A-38 33085 with a variable stroke, each of the two thread guide vanes consists of two arms which are guided longitudinally displaceably and carry internal teeth which engage with a gearwheel or another suitable adjusting element.<br><br>
The above-mentioned pronounced wear does not occur with this solution owing to the omission of links and blocks, but the production costs are relatively high so this solution has not caught on either.<br>
The invention is accordingly to provide a vane unit with which bobbins having bevelled end faces or having soft edges can be produced without pronounced wear or high production costs for the thread guide vanes and/or the drive thereof.<br>
The object set is achieved according to the invention in that the thread guide vanes are driven individually and their drives can be controlled in such a way that the locations of the thread transfer points can be adjusted as a function of the desired stroke.<br>
A first preferred embodiment of the thread guide device according to the invention is characterised in that the drives of the two thread guide vanes are connected via a common controller.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of the thread guide device according to the invention is characterised in that the arcuate plate is adjustable in design and has an adjusting drive.<br>
Owing to the individual drives of the thread guide blades according to the invention, on the one hand, the inevitable driving connection between the thread guide vanes and the bobbin shaft is eliminated and, on the other hand, each thread guide vane is driven individually. It is therefore possible to vary the stroke of the thread winding advance motion via the speed of the thread guide vanes and thus to produce bobbins with bevelled end faces or soft edges with a vane unit.<br>
If both thread guide vanes are driven at the same constant speed, the stroke of the thread winding advance motion is constant and the thread guide vane performing the working stroke passes over a specific angle in a specific period of time. If the thread guide vanes are now driven more slowly during the working stroke and correspondingly faster during the idle stroke, the respective thread guide performing the working stroke will pass over a smaller angle in said period and will cover a shorter distance so the stroke is reduced and the thread transfer is displaced to a new thread transfer point. The thread guide vane which performs the idle stroke and is driven faster passes over a greater angle in the same period of time and can therefore take up the thread at the new thread transfer point.<br>
The driving speeds of the thread guide vanes are selected according to the desired bevel of the end faces of the bobbin to be produced. The corresponding values of the bevels and the driving speeds are stored in the controller in the form of a table so the controller<br><br>
can automatically take the associated speed values from the table when the desired bevel is input.<br>
The adjusting drive of the arcuate plate is also connected to the controller, ensuring that the contour of the arcuate plate is invariably located in such a position that the thread guide vane performing the working stroke dips behind the contour at the thread transfer point.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a thread guide device for winding threads into cross-wound bobbins with two superimposed thread guide vanes which are rotatable in opposite directions and with an arcuate plate from whose contour the thread guide vanes issue and into which they dip again, the transfer of the thread taking place at the dipping points of the thread guide vanes in each case, characterized in that the arcuate plate has a drive for adjusting the arcuate plate crosswise to the thread and that the thread guide vanes have individual drives, said drives of the arcuate plate and of the thread guide vanes performing an adjustment of the locations of the thread transfer points as a function of the desired stroke by adjusting the position of the arcuate plate relative to the thread and by amending the velocity of the thread guide vanes.<br><br>
The invention is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to an embodiment and the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a winding station of a winding machine equipped with a<br>
thread guide device according to the invention, as viewed parallel to the bobbin axis.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3, 4 show a detail of the thread guide device of   Fig. 1 and 2 in two different operating states; and<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic sketch to illustrate operation.<br>
The winding station shown in Fig. 1 and 2 essentially consists of a bobbin shaft or bobbin spindle 2, which can be driven by a bobbin drive 1, for receiving a bobbin tube 3 on which a cross-wound bobbin is wound, and of a thread winding advance means 5 for the winding advance of a thread F taken off a supply bobbin, not shown, in the direction of the arrow P. The bobbin shaft 2 is arranged at the free end of a rocker 7 which is pivotally mounted on the machine frame 6 and is tilted resiliently downward in a clockwise direction, the bobbin 4 resting on a rotatably mounted supporting roll 8.<br>
The thread winding advance means 5 is a so-called vane unit with two thread guide vanes<br>
10	and 11 and an arcuate plate 12. The two thread guide vanes 10 and 11, only the thread guide vane 10 of which is shown in Fig. 2 for the sake of clarity, are superimposed and set into rotation in opposite directions. They lie above the arcuate plate 12 which forms an arcuate plate and which they pass over without contact. The thread guide vanes 10 and<br>
11	emerge periodically from the contour of the arcuate plate 12 forming a control cam and dip behind it again and, for this purpose, are arranged on two mutually parallel axes lying eccentrically to the arcuate plate 12.<br>
The drive of the thread guide vanes 10 and 11 is symbolised in Fig. 1 by two driving shafts 13 and 14, each of which has its own vane drive 16 or 17. The arcuate plate 12 also comprises a drive (not shown) and can be adjusted by it transversely to the thread F and transversely to the supporting roller 8. The two vane drives 16 and 17 are allocated a<br><br>
common controller 9 to which the bobbin drive 1 and the adjusting drive of the arcuate plate 12 are also attached. The thread F, as it is taken from the supply bobbin (not shown), passes through a tensioning and monitoring unit 18 which contains, for example, a thread damper and a thread stop motion.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the moment of the transfer of thread at the right-hand return point of the traversing movement. In the illustration, the thread guide vane 10 which had conveyed the thread F to the transfer point dips, during transfer of the thread, back behind the contour of the arcuate plate 12 and thus frees the thread F which now rests only on the contour of the arcuate plate 12. At the same time, the thread guide vane 11 which has emerged from the contour of the arcuate plate 12 shortly beforehand, takes over the thread F and conveys it to the left (Fig. 4). For exact positioning of the thread at the transfer points, guide noses 15 which form a respective thread inlet slot together with the contour of the arcuate disc 12 are provided in the region below the arcuate disc 12. In this way, the thread F is guided in the respective thread inlet slot at the moment of its transfer.<br>
The bobbin drive 1, the two vane drives 16 and 17 and the adjusting drive of the arcuate plate 12 are formed by suitable motors which are all connected to the controller 9. This controller, into which the winding parameters, in particular the winding ratio (number of rotations of the bobbin per double stroke), the angle of inclination of the thread winding advance motion determined by the winding ratio and corresponding to half the angle of intersection, the speed and the desired bevel at the end faces of the bobbin can be input, controls the traversing movement of the winding unit 5 in such a way that the desired bevel is created. The rotations of the bobbin can also be controlled by means of the traversing movement of the vane unit 5 in order to produce a specific winding.<br><br>
In the controller 9 parameters for various packages can be stored in the form of tables.<br>
The variation of the stroke of the thread winding advance motion will now be explained with reference to Fig. 5 which shows a schematic plan view of the vane unit 5 (Fig. 1). In the illustration, the two thread guide vanes 10 and 11 are arranged on two parallel axes 19 and 20 lying eccentrically to the arcuate plate 12. The arcuate plate 12 is shown in two adjusted positions, in a leading position shown in solid lines and a trailing position shown in broken lines. The tips of the thread guide vanes 20 and 11 each describe a circle K and K" during their rotational movement in the direction of the arrows indicated.<br>
The arcuate plate 12 has a position relative to the thread guide vanes 10 and 11 and a radius at its contour 21 forming a control cam which are such that the thread guide vanes<br><br>
10 and 11 project beyond the contour 21 in their central position and lie behind the contour in their lateral positions.<br>
In-between there are two points at which the thread guide vanes 10 and 11 dip just behind the contour 21 and thus free the thread which they had guided during the preceding working stroke. As already mentioned in the description of Fig. 3 and 4, these points which are defined by the point of intersection of the circle K or K" with the contour 21 define the thread transfer points which are also simultaneously the motion return points.<br>
When the arcuate plate 12 adopts its trailing position shown in broken lines, the thread transfer points are the points designated by A and B; the distance between the points A and B designated by H is the stroke of the thread winding advance motion. In the leading position of the arcuate plate 12 shown in solid lines, the thread transfer points are the points designated by A" and B"; H" designates the stroke of the thread winding advance motion which is much shorter than the stroke H in the trailing position of the arcuate plate 12.<br>
If the stroke of the thread winding advance motion is identical to H and the arcuate plate 12 is located in its trailing position, the two thread guide vanes 10 and 11 adopt the transfer position which is shown in broken lines and in which the thread is freed from the pivoting vane 11 at the transfer point B and is taken up by the pivoting vane 11 at the moment of thread transfer at point B. If the stroke is accordingly to be reduced from the length H to the length H", then the arcuate plate 12 has to be adjusted, on the one hand, in the direction of the arrow C from the trailing to the leading position, and it must be ensured, on the other hand, that the two thread guide vanes 10 and 11 now reach their transfer position not at point B but at point B".<br>
This means that the thread guide vane 11 has to cover a shorter distance in the time available for the working stroke and can therefore be driven more slowly during the working stroke and that the thread guide vane 10 has to cover a longer distance in the time available for the idle stroke and therefore has to be driven faster during the idle stroke. Or generally: during a reduction of the stroke, the thread guide vane performing the working stroke has to be driven more slowly and the thread guide vane performing the idle stroke has to be driven faster in each case.<br>
This individual drive of the thread guide vanes 10 and 11 is permitted by the individual drive 16 and 17 (Fig. 1). These are controlled by the controller 9 in such a way that, for any desired bevel of the end faces of the bobbin 4, the arcuate plate 12 is positioned<br><br>
accordingly and the thread guide vanes 10 and 11 are accelerated and decelerated accordingly. Acceleration and deceleration take place in each case only during a short phase at the beginning and at the end of the respective worl<ing or idle stroke whereas the thread guide vanes are driven as a function of rotation bobbin over remainder stroke.></ing>
It is finally pointed out that the vane unit does not necessarily have to have an arcuate plate if the thread guide vanes have an appropriate design.<br><br>
