BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an orally-disintegrating tablet and a<br>
manufacturing method thereof, and more specifically relates to an orally-disintegrating<br>
tablet that disintegrates easily in the buccal cavity even though it has comparatively<br>
high hardness and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
2.	Background Information<br>
[0002]<br>
Orally-disintegrating tablets are formulations that are easily taken by elderly<br>
people, children and patients that have difficulty swallowing. They are attracting<br>
attention as formulations that improve quality of life (QOL) because administration<br>
without water is possible.<br>
Typically, the orally-disintegrating tablets disintegrate rapidly after<br>
administration, but there is a problem in that they are difficult to use with automatic<br>
packaging machines due to their poor mechanical strength.<br>
[0003]<br>
In addition, in the manufacturing methods therefore, a method of pouring a<br>
dispersion liquid of a drug substance and an additive into PTP pockets or the like and<br>
lyophilizing them; a method using special machines such as a wet tableting machine; a<br>
method of tableting noncrystalline sugars at low pressure and humidifying and drying<br>
them to increase the hardness, and the like are known, but all of these methods are<br>
troublesome and complex and invite increases in production costs. Also, if the<br>
mechanical strength of the orally-disintegrating tablets themselves, which are obtained<br>
in this manner, is increased comparatively in consideration of handling properties, the<br>
property of disintegrating in the mouth is reduced, and a sufficiently satisfactory<br>
product is not obtained.<br>
[0004]<br>
Typically, sugar alcohols, which have good disintegration properties are used in<br>
a suitable manner as additives in orally-disintegrating tablets. However, sugar<br>
alcohols are normally in the form of fine powders, have poor molding properties and<br>
cannot be molded by tableting without modification. In addition, assuring tableting<br>
properties by mixing cellulose based excipients, such as crystal cellulose, into the sugar<br>
alcohol has been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
2004-175796), but if the cellulose component is contained in large quantities, fiber<br>
remains when it is administered, and the feeling on the tongue and taste degrade.<br>
Furthermore, tableting is possible using granulated sugar alcohols, but the<br>
 <br>
disintegration properties in the buccal cavity deteriorate, and tablets that require a<br>
minute or more to disintegrate are formed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
In light of the problems described above, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide an orally-disintegrating tablet that may be formed using a normal tableting<br>
machine, that reduces the disintegration time in the buccal cavity while imparting a<br>
hardness that is the same as an ordinary tablet and that has a suitable mechanical<br>
strength, and an manufacturing method thereof.<br>
[0006]<br>
The inventors has found, as a result of earnest investigations into additives for<br>
conventional orally-disintegrating preparations, that it is possible to unexpectedly<br>
obtain more satisfactory characteristics, by using a single ingredient in which forms are<br>
different, for both of the characteristics in the trade-off relationship between improving<br>
the mechanical strength of the orally-disintegrating tablets and the disintegration<br>
properties in the buccal cavity by mixing a granulation of sugar alcohol, which is<br>
superior in molding properties but degrades the disintegration properties, into a<br>
powder sugar alcohol, which has superior disintegration properties but degrades the<br>
molding properties.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention provides a orally-disintegrating tablet comprising a<br>
principal agent, a sugar alcohol powder and a sugar alcohol granule, wherein the<br>
orally-disintegrating tablet has a hardness of 30 N or greater.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a manufacturing method for an<br>
orally-disintegrating tablet comprising:<br>
mixing a sugar alcohol powder and a sugar alcohol granule with a principal<br>
agent to obtain a mixture and<br>
compression-molding the mixture at a hardness of 30 N or greater.<br>
[0008]<br>
According to the present invention, a smooth swallowing orally-disintegrating<br>
tablet, for which both the mechanical strength and the disintegration properties in the<br>
buccal cavity are favorable with using a normal tableting machine and without using<br>
special devices and the feeling on the tongue and taste are favorable, and a<br>
manufacturing method thereof are provided.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0009]<br>
An orally-disintegrating tablet of the present invention contains at least a<br>
 <br>
principal agent and a sugar alcohol.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the principal agent here, and examples of<br>
the principal agent include medicines for motion sickness, analgesic antipyretic,<br>
aromatic stomachic, digestant, antacid agent, vitamin, nutrient tonic, enzyme<br>
preparation, nutrient tonic supplement, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic drug, gout<br>
remedy, antihistamine, allergy agent, antibiotic agent, synthetic antibacterial, medicine<br>
for dental and oral use, bronchodilator, cough remedy, expectorant drug, sleep sedative,<br>
anxiolytic agent, antiepileptic drug, psychoneurotic agent, autonomic agent, central<br>
nervous system drug, antispasmodic agent, ameliorant of cerebral metabolism,<br>
ameliorant of cerebral circulation, antiParkinson's disease agent, Alzheimer therapeutic<br>
agent, cardiotonic agent, antiarrhythmia agent, diuretic agent, vasoconstrictor,<br>
vasodilatation agent, hypotensive agent, antihyperlipemia agent, constipating agent,<br>
peptic ulcer agent, cathartic, hormone agent, diabetes agent, and the like, as well as<br>
prodrugs.<br>
[0010]<br>
The primary agent may have any form, powder, solid, granulated powder or<br>
the like. There is no particular restriction on the size, and it may be suitably prepared<br>
in consideration of the feel on the tongue when administered as an orally-disintegrating<br>
tablet. Moreover, a method for making the grain diameters uniform such as a sieve or<br>
membrane filter and a method for pulverizing, such as a ball mill pulverizer, hammer<br>
mill pulverizer, or pin mill pulverizer may cited for giving the principal agent a suitable<br>
shape and size. In addition, it is suitable for the principal agent to be about 0.1 % or<br>
more by weight, and more suitably about 1 % or more by weight, as well as about 50 %<br>
or less by weight of the total weight of the orally-disintegrating tablet.<br>
[0011]<br>
Examples of the sugar alcohol include D-mannitol, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol,<br>
trehalose, maltitol, lactitol, and the like. Among these, it is preferably D-mannitol,<br>
erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol, and the like. These can be used alone or as mixture of two<br>
or more.<br>
[0012]<br>
The orally-disintegrating tablet of the present invention is formed using at least<br>
both a powder sugar alcohol and a granulated sugar alcohol. Powder means that it is<br>
not in a granulated form. Normally, the average particle size in powder sugar alcohols<br>
is cited as being smaller than about 50 urn, and typically, use of ones about 40 um or<br>
less is preferable.<br>
[0013]<br>
The granule is a sugar alcohol granulated by a method commonly known in the<br>
field, and for example, either wet granulation or dry granulation may be used for the<br>
manufacturing method. In the case of wet granulation, granulation may be done by a<br>
 <br>
variety of devices, such as a fluid bed granulator and dryer, agitating granulator,<br>
cylindrical extrusion granulator, rolling fluid bed granulation and coating machine, or<br>
spray drying. In the case of dry granulation, granulation may be done using various<br>
devices, dry granulators, such as roller compactors, slug tableting machines, and the<br>
like. Among these, forming using a wet granulation method is preferable. Since wet<br>
granulation methods yield more uniform particle diameters than dry granulation<br>
methods, and the proportion of fine powder is reduced, a granulated powder with<br>
better molding properties may typically be obtained.<br>
Moreover, when the sugar alcohol is granulated, any additives that may be<br>
added for pharmaceutical products, such as sweeteners, disintegration agents and<br>
colorants, may be added, as will be discussed in the following.<br>
[0014]<br>
It is preferable for the granulated substance to have, for example, an average<br>
particle diameter of about 50 m or greater, about 70m or greater, about 80 m or<br>
greater, and about 500 m or less, about 400 m or less, about 300 m or less, about 200<br>
m or less, about 150 m or less. Particularly, it is preferably to have an average<br>
particle diameter of at least about 80 m. From another point of view, it is suitable for<br>
the granulated substance to have a particle diameter of about 2 to about 20 times,<br>
preferably about 3 to about 8 times that of the powder sugar alcohol.<br>
[0015]<br>
It is suitable for the mixing ratio for the powder sugar alcohol and the<br>
granulated sugar alcohol to be a ratio by weight of about 8:1 to about 1:4, preferably<br>
about 6:1 to about 1:2, more preferably about 4:1 to 1:1 for the sugar alcohols. This is<br>
because molding becomes difficult for the tablets if there is too much of the powder,<br>
and if there is too much of the granulated substance, the orally-disintegration time<br>
tends to increase. Because of the mixing of the powder sugar alcohol and the<br>
granulated sugar alcohol in this range, there is a difference from a comparatively low<br>
density tablet, where the voids between the sugar alcohol particles like those in an<br>
orally-disintegrating tablet formed with granulated sugar alcohol only are connected, in<br>
that the voids between the particles are present independently to a moderate degree,<br>
and the powder sugar alcohol is dispersed in the vicinity of these voids. While<br>
molding with comparatively high hardness is possible because of this particle<br>
distribution, the tablet can easily be disintegrated in a short period of time by the saliva<br>
in the buccal cavity. Moreover, its is preferable for the independent voids here to be at<br>
least approximately the same as the average particle diameter of the granulated sugar<br>
alcohol or to be voids with smaller diameters than these, and it is preferable for these<br>
independent voids be present to a degree of about 50% or more, about 60 % ore more,<br>
and about 70 % or more of the total void volume.<br>
[0016]<br>
 <br>
In addition, in the present invention, it is suitable for the sugar alcohol powder<br>
and the sugar alcohol granules to be about 50 % or more, about 55 % or more, about<br>
60 % or more by weight of the total weight of the orally-disintegrating preparation.<br>
There is no particular upper restriction, but, normally it is about 70 % by weight. By<br>
including the sugar alcohols in this range, it is possible to assure both the disintegration<br>
properties and molding properties with the single sugar alcohol component, and along<br>
with disintegration happening smoothly in the buccal cavity while there is suitable<br>
mechanical strength, it is possible to make it easy to swallow with a good feeling on the<br>
tongue, feeling of roughness and flavor in the buccal cavity.<br>
[0017]<br>
Furthermore, normally used additives and the like may be included in the<br>
orally-disintegrating tablet of the present invention. Examples of the additive include<br>
disintegrating agent, excipient, binder, solubilizing agent, lubricant, fluidiser, sweetener,<br>
fragrance, foaming agent, surfactant, pH adjuster, preservative, colorant, and the like.<br>
[0018]<br>
Examples of the disintegrating agent include crospovidone, sodium starch<br>
glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl starch, starch, partially pregelatinized starch,<br>
cornstarch, lactose, calcium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, calcium citrate,<br>
light silicic anhydride, synthetic aluminum silicate crystalline cellulose, low substitution<br>
degree hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmellose, sodium croscarmellose, calcium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, carmellose, hydroxypropyl starch, and the like. These can be<br>
used alone or as mixture of two or more. Among these, it is preperably croscarmellose,<br>
sodium starch glycolate, carmellose, starch, hydroxypropyl starch, crospovidone, and<br>
the like. The amount of the disintegrating agent can be, for example, included about<br>
0.1 % or more, preferably about 0.5 % or more, and more preferably about 2 % or more<br>
by weight with respect to the total weight of the orally-disintegrating tablet. Also, it<br>
can be included about 30 % or less, preferably about 25 % or less, and more preferably<br>
about 15 % by weight.<br>
[0019]<br>
Examples of the excipient include glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose,<br>
hydrogenated maltose, and the like. These can be used alone or as mixture of two or<br>
more.<br>
Examples of the binder include a water-soluble substance such as gelatine, agar,<br>
alginic acid, sodium alginate, dextrin, xanthan gum, arabian gum,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, partially saponification polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose,<br>
pullulan, partially pregelatinized starch, sugar, and the like. These can be used alone<br>
or as mixture of two or more.<br>
[0020]<br>
 <br>
Examples of the solubilizing agent include magnesium oxide, calcium oxide,<br>
sodium citrate, magnesium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and the<br>
like. These can be used alone or as mixture of two or more.<br>
[0021]<br>

hydrogenated rape oil, hydrogenated castor oil, glycerin fatty acid ester, sodium stearyl<br>
fumarate, sodium benzoate, L-leucin, L-valine, and the like. These can be used alone<br>
or as mixture of two or more.<br>
[0022]<br>
Examples of the fluidizer include hydrated silicon dioxide, light silicic<br>
anhydride, and the like.<br>
Examples of the sweetener include aspartame, sodium saccharin, dipotassium<br>
glycyrrhizinate, stevia, thaumatin, and the like. These can be used alone or as mixture<br>
of two or more.<br>
Examples of the fragrance include mint, lemon or orange extract, and the like.<br>
Examples of the foaming agent include tartrate, citrate, bicarbonate, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0023]<br>
Examples of the surfactant include an anionic surfactant such as sodium<br>
alkylsulfate; a nonionic surfactant such as sucrose fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester and polyoxyethylene castor oil<br>
derivatives, and the like. These can be used alone or as mixture of two or more.<br>
Examples of the pH adjuster include an organic acid such as glycin, sodium<br>
acid carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate, dibasic sodium phosphate, acetic acid,<br>
succinic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and citric acid.<br>
Examples of the preservative include benzoic acid, parahydroxybenzoic acid,<br>
and the like or a salt thereof.<br>
Examples of the colorant include yellow oxide of iron, yellow iron sesquioxide,<br>

anhydride, Food Blue No.5, Food Yellow No.4, Food Yellow No.4 aluminum lake, Food<br>
Yellow No.5, Food Red No.2 (Amaranth), Food Red No.3, Food Red No.102, talc,<br>
sodium tetrafluorescein, green tea powder, Vitamin C, and the like.<br>
[0024]<br>
It is preferable for the orally-disintegrating tablet of the present invention to<br>
have a hardness that does not allow it to be destroyed by being removed from a<br>
packaging container or the like. Specifically, it is suitably 30 N or greater, preferably<br>
35 N or greater, more preferably 40 N or greater. The hardness of preparations may be<br>
measured using a tablet hardness gauge (Schleuinger Inc., Tablet Tester 6D), for<br>
 <br>
example.<br>
[0025]<br>
There is no particular restriction on the shape of the orally-disintegrating<br>
preparation of the present invention, and it may be made into a disk shape, donut<br>
shape, polygonal disk shape, spherical shape, elliptical shape, capsule shape or the like.<br>
Among these, the disk shape, which is the normal tablet shape, is preferable. There is<br>
no particular restriction on the size, and it is suitable for it to be slightly large so that it<br>
cannot be directly swallowed. For example, a diameter of about 3 to about 30 mm and<br>
a thickness of about 1 to about 10 mm are preferable.<br>
[0026]<br>
In addition, the manufacturing method for the orally-disintegrating tablet of the<br>
present invention comprises mixing the sugar alcohol powder and sugar alcohol<br>
granules into the principal agent and molding.<br>
[0027]<br>
The mixing of the principal agent, sugar alcohol powder, sugar alcohol granules<br>
and optionally an additive described above may be carried out using commonly known<br>
devices and the like by a method commonly known in the field. The principal agent<br>
and the sugar alcohol powder are normally not ones that have been granulated, and the<br>
sugar alcohol granules have been granulated in advance as described above, at mixing.<br>
These may be mixed in any order or at the same time.<br>
The mixing at this time is preferably carried out without wetting or adding<br>
moisture. Here, wetting or adding moisture means water content of more than about<br>
5% of the total weight of the orally-disintegrating tablet. Therefore, without wetting<br>
and without the addition of moisture means mixing water of about 5% or less to the<br>
total weight of the orally-disintegrating tablet.<br>
[0028]<br>
It is suitable to use commonly known devices or the like, compress and carry<br>
out the molding of the mixture by methods that are commonly known in the field. For<br>
example, a tableting mortar and upper and lower pestles for tableting are used, and a<br>
hydraulic hand press, a single punch tableting machine, a rotary tableting machine or<br>
the like is used for the device for compression molding.<br>
[0029]<br>
The tablets obtained in compression molding have a suitable hardness, for<br>
example about 30 N or greater, and suitable independent voids are assured in the<br>
tablets. Adjustment and execution so that there can be rapid disintegration are<br>
necessary for the orally-disintegrating tablets. For example, there is no particular<br>
restriction for the tableting pressure, and it may be adjusted suitably according to the<br>
device used, principles, size of tablet, type of principal agent and the like. When a<br>
device like that described above is used, for example, a tableting pressure of about 50<br>
 <br>
kg/cm2 or greater and about 1500 kg/cm2 or less is suitable, and about 300 kg/cm2 or<br>
greater and about 1000 kg/cm2 or less is preferable.<br>
Moreover, it is also suitable for being carried out without wetting and without<br>
moisture being added at compression molding.<br>
Typically, with molding as a production method for orally-disintegrating<br>
tablets, there is a method of drying after the mixed powder is tableted in a wet state<br>
(wet tableting), a method of mixing in a noncrystalline sugar in advance, tableting at a<br>
comparatively low pressure, adding moisture and drying (aging) after that to increase<br>
the tablet hardness, and the like. These methods may be used in the present invention,<br>
but as was described earlier, in molding methods for normal tablets, there is merit in<br>
being able to manufacture them conveniently without requiring special processes like<br>
these.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the following, examples of the orally-disintegrating tablet of the present<br>
invention and the manufacturing method thereof will be described in detail.<br>
Example 1<br>
500 g of D-mannitol was introduced into a fluid bed granulator (Powerex Corp.,<br>
Multiplex), a 10% aqueous solution of D-mannitol (Nikken Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.)<br>
sprayed as the spraying fluid and fluid bed granulation carried out. After 500g was<br>
sprayed, it was dried and granulated mannitol was obtained (average particle diameter<br>
150 to 220 urn).<br>
In addition, using the same method, 500 g of erythritol (Mitsubishi Chemical<br>
Corp.) was introduced into, a 10% aqueous solution of erythritol sprayed as the spray<br>
fluid, fluid bed granulated, sprayed 500 g of the aqueous solution, after that dried, and<br>
granulated erythritol obtained (average particle diameter 80 to 130 urn).<br>
For the commercial sugar alcohol granules, direct tableting mannitol (Patikku<br>
100M, Merck, granulated mannitol, average particle diameter 90 to 120 (m) was used<br>
for the granulated substance.<br>
[0031]<br>
Crystal cellulose (Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp., Seorasu PH301), crospovidon<br>
XL10 (ISP), aspartame (Ajinomoto Co., Inc), magnesium stearate (Taihei Chemical<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd.), crosscarmellose (Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp.) and hydroxypropyl<br>
starch (Fruend Industrial Co., Ltd.) were used as additives.<br>
[0032]<br>
The various compounds described above were tableted so as to have a diameter<br>
of 7 mm with a weight of 100 mg per tablet in a rotary tableting machine according to<br>
the recipe given in Table 1 through Table 3.<br>
In addition, as a comparative example, an orally-disintegrating preparation was<br>
tableted using only the powder sugar alcohol or only the granulated substance as<br>
 <br>
shown in Table 4.<br>

[0037]<br>
From the results in Tables 1 through 4, the hardness was 30 N or greater for all<br>
of the examples of the present invention, but even though it was high, the buccal cavity<br>
disintegration time was within 30 sec, and a rapidly disintegrating orally-disintegrating<br>
 <br>
tablet was obtained. Moreover, all of the orally-disintegrating tablets in the examples<br>
had a good feel on the tongue in the buccal cavity, and there was easy swallowing with<br>
no feeling of roughness or sense of discomfort.<br>
On the other hand, when only the powder sugar alcohol was used in the<br>
comparative examples, tableting was impossible, and tablets could not be formed. In<br>
addition, when only the granulated sugar alcohol was used, the buccal cavity<br>
disintegration time increased.<br>
[0038]<br>
Regardless of the type of principal agent and regardless of the part that is<br>
disintegrated, the present invention may be used over a wide range of formulations that<br>
disintegrate and administer the agent.<br>
This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-103925.<br>

powder and a sugar alcohol granule, wherein the orally-disintegrating tablet has a<br>
hardness of 30 N or greater.<br>
2.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein the sugar<br>
alcohol granule has a particle diameter of 2 to 20 times that of the sugar alcohol powder.<br>
3.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein the sugar<br>
alcohol powder is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
D-mannitol, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol.<br>
4.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein the sugar<br>
alcohol granule is formed by a wet granulation method.<br>
5.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 4, wherein the sugar<br>
alcohol granule is formed by a method of agitating and granulating, fluid bed<br>
granulating or spray drying.<br>
6.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein the sugar<br>
alcohol granule has a particle diameter of 80 m or more.<br>
7.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein a mixture<br>
ratio of the sugar alcohol powder and the sugar alcohol granule is of 8:1 to 1:4 by<br>
weight of the total weight of the sugar alcohols.<br>
8.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, wherein an amount of<br>
the sugar alcohol powder and the sugar alcohol granule is 50 % or more by weight of<br>
the total weight of the orally-disintegrating tablet.<br>
9.	The orally-disintegrating tablet according to claim 1, further comprising at<br>
least one compound selected from the group consisting of croscarmellose, sodium<br>
starch glycolate, carmellose, starch, hydroxypropyl starch and crospovidone.<br>
10.	A manufacturing method for an orally-disintegrating tablet comprising:<br>
mixing a sugar alcohol powder and a sugar alcohol granule with a principal<br>
agent to obtain a mixture and<br>
compression-molding the mixture at a hardness of 30 N or greater.<br>
 <br>
11. The method according to claim 10, wherein the mixing and<br>
compression-molding are carried out without wetting and without addition of<br>
moisture.<br>
 <br>
An orally-disintegrating tablet comprises a principal agent, a sugar alcohol powder and a sugar alcohol granule, wherein the orally-disintegrating tablet has a hardness of 30 N or greater. According to the present invention, a smooth swallowing orally-disintegrating tablet, for which both the mechanical strength and the<br>
disintegration properties in the buccal cavity are favorable with using a normal tableting machine and without using special devices and the feeling on the tongue and taste are favorable, is provided.<br>
