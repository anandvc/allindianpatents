COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A UNIVERSAL   SELF   ADJUSTING   LOCKING   STRIP   FOR   LOCKING MULTIPLE OUTLET BY SINGLE PAD LOCK<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 400 079 MAHARASHTRA, India, a INDIAN National Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
836/MUMNP/2001<br>
29/8/2001<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
20/2/204<br>
29/8/2001<br><br>
The invention relates to a Universal Self Adjusting Locking Strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock. More particularly the invention relates to a Universal self adjusting locking strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock.<br>
The conventional locking system wherein the two separate member are locked by means of padlock is well known but the padlocks per se are not very convenient to use directly because of non standardization in various applications. Carriages provided with a liquid material for transport such as inflammable material, hazardous material which are very sensitive to spark and which have partitions inside the tanker thereby several outlets which requires to be locked during transportation for keeping the inside material intact and to overcome the pilferage during the transport, safety as well as goodwill of the manufacturer and the genuinely of the material to be supplied requires pilferage proof in locking systems where several outlet are locked at a time. The outlet valves of different tankers do not have uniform distances; therefore same locking strip may not be possibly used for all tankers.<br>
By research and development inventor has developed a Universal Self Adjusting Locking Strip which can be used for oil tanker or inflammable material transportation with several outlets which are required to be locked for supplying genuine material without adulteration and malpractice's are avoided during transportation.<br>
A universal locking strip which is adjustable horizontally, vertically and axially is of prime need.<br><br>
A Universal Self Adjusting Locking Strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock comprising a top strip made from any metal or composite having elongated oval shaped slots / grooves at distance on the strip as per the requirement of the customer. The extended oval shape is given for adjusting in the horizontal direction of the different outlet or valves of the tanker. The said slot is provided with L member where the head of L member is slideably moveable in the grooves of the top strip and the L shape member having vertical oval shape elongated groove which is passed through the valve wheel of the outlet for connecting the valve wheel with that L member. The vertical groove is provided for the height adjustment of the outlet valves, a locking strip is passed through the slot of the L member for locking the plurality of outlet valves with single padlock; the said locking rod is provided at its rear end with a stopper and front end is provided with flat strip with a groove for the shackle of padlock to pass through thereby locking the plurality of outlet by a single padlock.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 3 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1: is a  schematic  view  of a Universal Self Adjusting Locking Strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock.<br>
Figure 2: is the  elevation of a Universal  Self Adjusting  Locking Strip for locking multiple outlets  by single padlock<br>
Figure 3:   is  the top view of a Universal  Self Adjusting  Locking Strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock<br>
Accordingly  there is  provided a  Universal    Self  adjusting  locking strip  for<br><br><br>
locking multiple outlets by single padlock (1) comprising a top flat strip (2) having multiplicity of elongated oval slots (3) on its surface at regular intervals as per the customer requirements; the said grooves / slots accommodating another L shape member (4) with head (5) engaged in slot, capable of sliding in the slot and the elongated vertical L shaped member (4) for conveniently entering the valve wheel or mating member (6) which are adjustable with the slots provided in the top strip; the said vertical leg having elongated oval shaped vertical slots / grooves (7) through which locking rod (8) is passed through, for adjusting the locking rod in the vertical direction; the said locking rod having a stopper (9) at rear end and flat front end is provided with grooves (10) for the shackle of the padlock to pass through thereby locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock; L shape member along with its head can rotate on its axis for adjusting to the different outlet valve alignment.<br>
There is a provision that the master key is provided to the filling source and different common key to the individual user at the outlet so that filling and unloading is possible by authorized   people only.<br>
A liquid tanker cylindrical in shape, horizontally placed on the truck are provided with compartments inside the container with individual inlet and outlet valves. The outlet valves are on the tank with the stem member and the wheel for opening and closing the mouth of the outlet. Generally it was observed that during handling of the liquid contents very often give rise to spurious substance and loss of liquid material and pilferage  during transport occur.<br>
Therefore the   object   was to   prevent such malpractice's. The inventor has devised  this  improved  strip  member for locking   plurality   of outlets  by means of a single   padlock   thereby preventing    such malpractice, so as to<br><br><br>
keep the genuineness of the material intact and good will of the manufacturer, distributors.<br>
An ultra locking system of padlock with / without restricted keyways with master key with the improved universal self adjusting locking strip effectively prevents such malpractice's.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications which are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described. embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
A Universal Self adjusting locking strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock (1) comprising a top flat strip (2) having multiplicity of elongated oval slots (3) on its surface at regular intervals as per the customer requirements; the said grooves / slots accommodating another L shape member (4) with head (5) engaged in slot capable of sliding in the slot and the elongated vertical L shaped member (4) for conveniently entering the valve wheel or mating member (6) which are adjustable with the slots provided in the top strip; the said vertical leg having elongated oval shaped vertical slots/ grooves (7) through which locking rod (8) is passed through, for adjusting the locking rod in the vertical direction; the said locking rod having a stopper (9) at rear end and flat front end is provided with grooves (10) for the shackle of the padlock to pass through thereby locking plurality of outlets by means of single padlock; L shape member along with its head can rotate on its axis for adjusting to the different outlet valve alignment.<br>
A Universal Self adjusting locking strip for locking multiple outlets by single padlock as claimed in claim 1, wherein the locking strip is adjustable horizontally, vertically and axially thereby the variation of outlet valves in different tankers are taken care of.<br>
A Universal self adjusting locking strip for locking multiple outlets by of single Padlock as claimed in claim 1, wherein the strip members are made from brass, stainless steel, iron or any nonferrous/composite strong material.<br><br>
