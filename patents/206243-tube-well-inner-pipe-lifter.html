MR. JITENDRA SINGH BAI*S,<br>
C/O. SANJAY SINGH BAIS. H/52, BARGI HILLS COLONY, JABALPUR (M. P.), PIN- 482 002, INDIA<br><br>
The following specification particularly desaibes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
27-04-2004<br><br>
ORIGINAL <br>
INTRODUCTION TO THE HELD OF THE INVENTION.<br>
This invention relates to TUBE WELL INNER PIPE LIFTER'. PRIOR ART AND DRAW BACKS.<br>
Tube Wells are well known and thousands are being erected everywhere throughout the year to lift underground water. Such tube wells are erected by Municipalities, Corporations, Private House Builders, societies, Railways and many Govt, and Private agencies.<br>
All tube wells are common in construction in that a bore is made in the ground to the required depth to reach the water table, an outer casing of a metallic tube put in place and an inner tube is inserted with a water filter at the lower end. The filter remains immersed in the water. With the help of motor and pump above the ground, the underground water is sucked and fed to overhead tank.<br>
In another variation, the inner tube is connected to an operating hand lever above the ground so that water can be lifted by manually operating on the handle.<br>
The whole length of inner tube is made of several pieces of independent tubes of standard lengths. The tube ends are externally threaded and two tubes are joined using an internally threaded coupling piece. The outer diameters in the coupled portions are thus wider than the outer diameter of the inner tubes.<br>
As at present, a tube well becomes inoperative for various reasons.<br>
a)	The water table goes down,<br>
b)	The inner tube gets choked,<br>
c)	The filter becomes clogged.<br>
In all such cases, the inner tube is lifted by manual operation which is a laborious process, labour oriented, time consuming and expensive. For joining the several pieces during the erection of the well also the same process goes on.<br><br><br>
But there are also instances where, due to corrosion and other reason, the inner pipe breaks and gets lodged inside the well. The well becomes inoperative. The broken piece cannot be retrieved and the wells are sealed off. This is a great loss of costly material and further another well is to be prepared to lift water.<br>
There are plenty of such abandoned wells which cannot be re-used. Even before abandoning a well no effort is made or means available to retrieve the broken inner tubes.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
It is an object of the invention to propose a lifter for retrieving broken inner tubes from tube wells so that these wells can be made operative.<br>
It is another object to propose a lifter, which can be used to retrieve any inner tube from any depth in the wells.<br>
It is a further object to propose a lifter, which can locate even pipes resting titled to one side on the wall of the well casing and retrieve it.<br>
It is yet another object to propose a lifter, which can be operated manually or mechanically.<br>
It is a still further object to propose a lifter, which is very efficient, dependable and can also be used to redeposit the inner pipes easily.<br>
It is yet another object to propose a lifter, which can be used easily and can be transported easily to different locations.<br>
Other objects will be apparent from the following paragraphs.<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.   According to this invention there is provided a tube well inner pipe lifter comprising:<br>
(i)  a lower part (A), a middle part B and an upper part D,<br>
(ii) said lower part being a hollow member having preferably a thin lower most circumferential wall portion having a gradual upward tapered opening adopted in getting around the broken top end of a pipe in the well even if it is in a standing position and having a vertical central opening at the top end suited to accommodate the outer diameter of an inner tube,<br><br>
(iii) the middle part having a tube or tube coupling holding and locking unit inside the same and located in alignment with the central opening in the lower part and having a continuous passage there through vertically for the inner tube to pass through,<br>
(iv) the top being a hollow member having a central passage in alignment with the passage in the middle part for the inner tube to pass through,<br>
(v) the top part having provision for holding same to a lifter above the ground and wherein the lower part, the middle part and the upper part are threaded pieces.<br>
The middle part has coaxially a lower narrow passage and an upper broader passage such that the lower passage is adopted to receive the broken pipe end as the lifter is lowered and the pipe enters the upper passage.<br>
Inside the upper passage, which extends throughout the remaining portion of the middle part, there is located said pipe locking unit which rests on the lower end of the upper passage due to the stepped construction and has a long lower cylindrical portion and a short upper cylindrical portion and in the intermediate meeting region of these two portions, there is provided said locking unit having a sideways retractable metal member of a smaller diameter than that of the pipe coupling.<br>
This can be formed by having two spring plates with their lower ends welded to the lower inner end of the locking unit leaving the upper ends free.<br>
As the lifter is lowered enough, the spring plate portions are pressed apart by the outer diameter of the pipe coupling. As the lifter is pulled out, the coupling member gets locked onto and by the top of the spring plate members.<br>
Various alternatives are possible.<br>
The lifter can be suitably modified to handle pipes of different diameters and at any depth.<br>
The whole lifter can be pulled out in any known manner with the inner pipe locked therein.<br>
The invention is more fully disclosed in the accompanying drawing in which figures 1 to 7 illustrate the various views of the lifter.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a front elevation of the assembly with inside component shows in dotted lines.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the plan view (Top view), front view, left side view, right side view and bottom view of component 'A' (part- A) shown in fig. 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the plan view (Top view), front view, left side view , right side view and bottom view of component 'B' (part B) shows figure 1.<br>
Figure -5 shows the plan view (Top view), front view, left side view, right side view and bottom view of component 'D' (part D) of figure 1.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the assembly having parts -A, B, C, D or A, B C &amp; D is lowered in any suitable conventional manner into the bore hole where the broken inner tube lies.<br>
The lower most portion D of part A has very thin cross section almost like a thin ring and can surround the head of the broken pipe. It has an upward tapered opening D2 that helps in making the pipe assume straight position gradually with the further lowering of the assembly.<br>
As the pipe reaches the upper central portion of part D it is directly under the bore or opening D3 which is slightly larger in diameter than the diameter of the pipe couplings.<br>
The opening D# is in alignment with the opening B1 in part B which opening terminates in another co¬axial wider opening B2 thereby forming a steeped portion B3 inside.<br>
There is provided an independent locking device C simply inserted from the top of the bore B2 so as to rest on the step B3.<br>
This locking device has a lower diameter greater than the pipe coupling and intermediate diameter B4 almost equal to the outer diameter of the pipe. In other words the diameter B4 is smaller than the outer diameter of the coupling.<br>
There are two nearly quarter circle leaf spring plates D5, D6 fixed to the lower inner end of the locking unit C with the top ends bent inwards forming the constriction. This gives a spring effect to these two top ends of the spring plates.<br>
As the assembly is further lowered around a located pipe the pipe passes through the bore in part-6 from below with the coupling with ease. But as the coupling reaches the construction it presses upon the top ends of the spring plates, which give way to the coupling.<br>
After lowering the assembly a little more, the coupling portion passes through the constriction and as soon as the lower end of the coupling has passed through the constriction, the top portions of the<br><br>
spring plate, which were under pressure are now released and snap back to the original position forming the construction.<br>
At this point, the lowering of the assembly may be discontinued when the coupling is well above the constriction. These an be easily calculated by means of standard lengths of pipes/ couplings. If desired one can also allow a second or a third coupling to pass through the construction. When the lowering and when it has been assured that the assembly has been lowered enough beyond the lower end of a coupling, the assembly is lifted slowly and carefully.<br>
The lower end of the coupling immediately above the top ends of the plates get supported on the top ends of the leaf springs is thus locked and prevented from slipping down. Its weight further exerts pressure on the top of the leaf springs further adding to the gripping / holding action.<br>
The whole broken or closed inner pipe can thus be lifted and retrieved.<br>
As the coupled inner pipes are lifted, it can be lifted to required length of each pipe, held at that position using holding rods across the holes in part B and the pipe and coupling unscrewed and the process continued.<br>
It is efficient and even a piece left at the bottom of the bore wall casing can be retrieved.<br>
In the modification shown in figures 6 &amp; 7, the part D is provided with stepped inside construction to accommodate pipes of various diameters.<br>
The distance or gap between the top ends of the leaf spring can also be adjusted as per the diameter of the pipes and couplings.<br><br>
