STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH<br>
[0001]	This invention was made with Government support under Contract No.<br>
F33615-03-D-5607/0002 awarded by the United States Air Force. The United States Government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002]	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/915,166, filed May 1, 2007, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The present invention is directed to compositions, such as sealant<br>
compositions, that include a polythioether.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	Thiol-terminated sulfur-containing compounds are known to be well-<br>
suited for use in various applications, such as aerospace sealant compositions, due, in<br>
large part, to their fuel-resistant nature upon cross-linking. Other desirable properties for<br>
aerospace sealant compositions include low temperature flexibility, short curing time<br>
(the time required to reach a predetermined strength) and elevated-temperature<br>
resistance, among others. Sealant compositions exhibiting at least some of these<br>
characteristics and containing thiol-terminated sulfur-containing compounds are<br>
described in, for example, United States Patent Nos. 2,466,963, 4,366,307, 4,609,762,<br>
5,225,472, 5,912,319, 5,959,071, 6,172,179, 6,232,401, 6,372,849 and 6,509,418.<br>
[0005]	It has recently become desirable to provide aerospace sealant<br>
compositions having one or more of the above described desirable properties, which are also sprayable, i.e., they can be applied in a continuous, relatively thick, film that adheres to a substrate in a single pass using a spray gun, while also being substantially free of solvents.<br>
[0006]	The present invention has been developed in view of the foregoing<br>
desires.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	In certain respects, the present invention is directed to multi-component<br>
compositions. These compositions of the present invention comprise: (a) a first component comprising an isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane; and (b) a second component comprising an amine/hydroxy-functional polythioether.<br>
[0008]	In other respects, the present invention is directed to sealant compositions<br>
that comprise a polythioether. These sealant compositions of the present invention are:<br>
(a) substantially free of volatile organic compounds; (b) spray able; and (c) fuel resistant.<br>
[0009]	The present invention is also directed to, inter alia, methods for sealing an<br>
aperture utilizing a composition of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	For purposes of the following detailed description, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention may assume various alternative variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. Moreover, other than in any operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing, for example, quantities of ingredients used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0011]	Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth<br>
the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard variation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
 [0012]	Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is<br>
intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10" is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10.<br>
[0013]	As indicated, certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to<br>
compositions, such as sealant, coating, and/or electrical potting compositions. As used<br>
herein, the term "sealant composition" refers to a composition that is capable of<br>
producing a film that has the ability to resist atmospheric conditions, such as moisture<br>
and temperature and at least partially block the transmission of materials, such as water,<br>
fuel, and other liquid and gasses. In certain embodiments, the sealant compositions of<br>
the present invention are useful, e.g., as aerospace sealants and linings for fuel tanks.<br>
[0014]	The compositions of the present invention comprise a polythioether. As<br>
used herein, the term "polythioether" refers to a polymer comprising at least one thioether linkage; that is -[-CH2-S-CH2-]-.<br>
[0015]	In certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention<br>
comprise an isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane. As used herein, the term "isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane" refers to a compound comprising a polythioether, at least one of a urethane linkage (-NH-C(O)-O-) and/or a thiourethane linkage (-NH-C(O)-S-), and one or more isocyanate functional groups. In certain embodiments, the isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane utilized in the present invention comprises a plurality of isocyanate groups, in some case two isocyanate groups, per molecule.<br>
[0016]	The isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethanes and/or<br>
polythiourethanes included in certain embodiments of the compositions of the present<br>
invention can be prepared, for example, by reacting one or more isocyanate reactive<br>
polythioethers, such as thiol-functional and/or hydroxy-functional polythioethers, with<br>
an excess of one or more isocyanate functional compounds, as discussed in detail below.<br>
[0017]	In certain embodiments, the isocyanate functional polythioether-<br>
polyurethane and/or polythiourethane included in the compositions of the present<br>
invention is derived from a polythioether comprising at least two reactive thiol groups, in some cases, such a polythioether has two reactive thiol groups. As used herein, the terms "thiol", "thiol group", "mercapto", and "mercapto group" refer to an -SH group that is capable of forming a thiourethane linkage, i.e., a -NH-C(0)-S- linkage, with an isocyanate group.<br>
[0018]	In certain embodiments, the polythioether comprising at least two reactive<br>
thiol groups comprises a difunctional thiol-terminated polythioether, such as, for example, those having the following structure (I):<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
wherein<br>
each R1 independently denotes a C2-10 n-alkylene group, such as a C2-6 n-alkylene group; a C2-6 branched alkylene group, such as a C3-6 branched alkylene group having one or more pendant groups which can be, for example, alkyl groups, such as methyl or ethyl groups; an alkyleneoxy group; a C6-8 cycloalkylene group; a C6-10 alkylcycloalkylene<br>
group; a heterocyclic group; or<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
 wherein s is an integer having a value ranging from 2 to 6, q is an integer having a value ranging from 1 to 5, r is an integer having a value ranging from 2 to 10, R3 is hydrogen or methyl, and X denotes O, S, or -NR2-, wherein R denotes an alkyl group; each R independently denotes methylene; a C2-10 n-alkylene group, such as a C2-6 n-alkylene group; a C2-6 branched alkylene group, such as a C3-6 branched alkylene group; a C6-8 cycloalkylene group; a C6-14 alkylcycloalkylene, such as a C6-10 alkylcycloalkylene; a<br>
heterocyclic group, or,<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
 wherein s, q,<br>
r, R3 and X are as defined above; m is a rational number having a value ranging from 0 to 50, such as 0 to 10 or 1 to 10; n is an integer having a value ranging from 1 to 60; and p is an integer having a value ranging from 2 to 6.<br>
[0019]	Such thiol-terminated polythioethers suitable for use in the present<br>
invention can be prepared by a number of methods. In certain embodiments, (n+1) moles of a compound having the structure (II):<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
or a mixture of at least two different compounds having the structure (II), are reacted with (n) moles of a compound having the structure (III):<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
or a mixture of at least two different compounds having the structure (III), in the presence of a catalyst. In structure (II) and (III) above, R1, R2 and all indices are defined as in structure (I). This method affords a thiol-terminated difunctional polythioether.<br>
[0020]	The compounds of structure (II) are dithiol compounds. In certain<br>
embodiments, such dithiols include those compounds in which R1 is a C2-6 n-alkylene group, i.e., 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1,3-propanedithiol, 1,4-butanedithiol, 1,5-pentanedithiol or 1,6-hexanedi thiol.<br>
[0021]	Other suitable dithiols include those compounds in which R1 is a C3-6<br>
branched alkylene group, having one or more pendent groups which can be, for example, methyl or ethyl groups. Suitable compounds having branched alkylene R1 include 1,2-propanedithiol, 1,3-butanedithiol, 2,3-butanedithiol, 1,3-pentanedithiol and l,3-dithio-3-methylbutane. Other useful dithiols include those in which R1 is a C6-8 cycloalkylene or C6-10 alkylcycloalkylene group, for example, dipentenedimercaptan and ethylcyclohexyldithiol (ECHDT).<br>
[0022]	Further suitable dithiols include one or more heteroatom substituents in<br>
the carbon backbone, that is, dithiols in which X is a heteroatom such as O, S or another bivalent heteroatom radical; a secondary or tertiary amine group, i.e., -NR -, where R6 is hydrogen or methyl; or another substituted trivalent heteroatom. In certain embodiments, X is O or S, and thus R1 is -[(-CHR3-)s-O-]q -(-CHR3-)r- or -[(-CHR3-)S -S-]q-(-CHR3-)r-. In certain embodiments, the indices s and r are equal, and, in some cases, both have the value of 2. Exemplary dithiols of this type include dimercaptodiethylsulfide (DMDS) (s, r=2, q=1, X=S); dimercaptodioxaoctane (DMDO) (s, q, r=2, X=0); and l,5-dimercapto-3-oxapentane (s,r=2, q=1, X=0). It is also possible to employ dithiols that include both heteroatom substituents in the carbon backbone and pendent alkyl, such as methyl, groups. .Such compounds include methyl-substituted DMDS, such as HS-CH2CH(CH3)-S-CH2CH2-SH, HS-CH(CH3)CH2-S-CH2CH2-SH<br>
and dimethyl substituted DMDS, such as HS-CH2CH(CH3)-S-CH(CH3)CH2-SH and HS-CH(CH3)CH2-S-CH2CH(CH3)-SH. Two or more different dithiols of structure (II) can also be employed if desired.<br>
[0023]	The compounds of structure (III) are divinyl ethers. Divinyl ether itself<br>
(m=0) can be used. Other suitable divinyl ethers include those compounds having at least one oxyalkylene group, such as from 1 to 4 oxyalkylene groups (i.e., those compounds in which m is an integer from 1 to 4). In certain embodiments, m is an integer from 2 to 4. It is also possible to employ commercially available divinyl ether mixtures in producing suitable polythioethers. Such mixtures are characterized by a non-integral average value for the number of alkoxy units per molecule. Thus, m in structure (III) can also take on non-integral, rational values between 0 and 10, such as between 1 and 10, or, in some cases, between 1 and 4, such as between 2 and 4.<br>
[0024]	Exemplary divinyl ethers include those compounds in which R is C2-6 n-<br>
alkylene or C2-6 branched alkylene, such as ethylene glycol divinyl ether (EG-DVE) (R2 =ethylene, m=l); butanediol divinyl ether (BD-DVE) (R2 butylene, m=l); hexanediol divinyl ether (HD-DVE) (R2 =hexylene, m=l); diethylene glycol divinyl ether (DEG-DVE) (R2 =ethylene, m=2); triethylene glycol divinyl ether (R2 =ethylene, m=3); tetraethylene glycol divinyl ether (R2 =ethylene, m=4) and polytetrahydrofuryl divinyl ether. In certain embodiments, the polyvinyl ether monomer can further comprise one or more pendent groups selected from alkylene groups, hydroxyl groups, alkeneoxy groups, and amine groups. Useful divinyl ether blends include "PLURIOL®" type blends such as PLURIOL® E-200 divinyl ether (commercially available from BASF), for which R2=ethyl and m=3.8, as well as "DPE" polymeric blends such as DPE-2 and DPE-3 (commercially available from International Specialty Products, Wayne, N J.).<br>
[0025]	Useful divinyl ethers in which R" is C2-6 branched alkylene can be<br>
prepared by reacting a polyhydroxy compound with acetylene. Exemplary compounds of this type include compounds in which R2 is an alkyl-substituted methylene group such as -CH(CH3)- or an alkyl-substituted ethylene such as -CH2CH(CH3)-.<br>
[0026]	Other useful divinyl ethers include compounds in which R is<br>
polytetrahydrofuryl (poly-THF) or polyoxyalkylene, in some cases having an average of about 3 monomer units.<br>
[0027]	In some cases, trivinyl ether monomers such as trimethylolpropane<br>
trivinyl ether; tetrafunctional vinyl ether monomers such as pentaerythritol tetravinyl ether; and mixtures thereof, can be used.<br>
[0028]	Two or more compounds of the structure (III) can be used. Thus, in<br>
certain embodiments, two compounds of structure (II) and one compound of structure (III), one compound of formula structure (II) and two compounds of structure (III), two compounds of structure (II) and of structure (III), and more than two compounds of one or both structures, can be used to produce a variety of polythioethers, and all such combinations of compounds are contemplated as being suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
[0029]	Although, as indicated above, compounds of the structures (II) and (III)<br>
which have pendent alkyl groups, for example pendent methyl groups, are useful in the invention, compounds of the structures (II) and (III), which are free of pendent methyl or other alkyl groups, also afford polythioethers that are suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
[0030]	The reaction between the compounds of structures (II) and (III) is<br>
sometimes catalyzed by a free radical catalyst. Suitable free radical catalysts include azo compounds, for example azobisnitrile compounds such as azo(bis)isobutyronitrile (AIBN); organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide and t-butyl peroxide; and similar free-radical generators. The reaction can also be effected by irradiation with ultraviolet light either with or without the use of a photosensitizer, such as benzophenone.<br>
[0031]	In certain embodiments of the present invention, the isocyanate functional<br>
polythioether-polyurethane and/or polythiourethane included in the compositions of the present invention is derived from a hydroxy-functional polythioether comprising at least two reactive hydroxy groups, in some cases, such a polythioether has two reactive hydroxy groups. As used herein, the term "hydroxy group" refers to an -OH group that<br>
is capable of forming a urethane linkage, i.e., a -NH-C(0)-0- linkage, with an isocyanate group.<br>
[0032]	Hydroxy functional polythioethers suitable for use in the present<br>
invention can be prepared by any suitable technique that will be understood by those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the hydroxy functional polythioether that is utilized is derived from a thiol-functional polythioether of the type previously described herein. In these embodiments, the thiol-functional polythioether can be converted to a hydroxy-functional polythioether by reacting the thiol-functional polythioether with, for example, a lower alkyl substituted epoxide. For example, in the case of a difunctional thiol-terminated polythioether, one mole of the polythioether can be reacted with two moles of the lower alkyl substituted epoxide, such as propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide.<br>
[0033]	As previously indicated, the isocyanate functional polythioether-<br>
polyurethanes and/or polythiourethanes included in certain embodiments of the compositions of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by reacting one or more thiol-functional polythioethers and/or one or more hydroxy-functional polythioethers, such as any of those described above, with an excess of one or more isocyanate functional compounds. Thus, in certain embodiments, for example, (n) moles of one or more thiol-functional polythioethers and/or hydroxy-functional polythioethers are reacted with (&gt;n) moles of one or more isocyanate functional compounds.<br>
[0034]	Suitable isocyanate functional compounds useful in preparing the<br>
isocyanate functional polythioether-polyurethanes and/or polythiourethanes utilized in certain embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, polymeric and C2-C20 linear, branched, cycloaliphatic and aromatic polyisocyanates. Non-limiting examples can include polyisocyanates having backbone linkages chosen from urethane linkages (-NH-C(O)-O-), thiourethane linkages (-NH-C(O)-S-), thiocarbamate linkages (-NH-C(S)-O-), dithiourethane linkages (-NH-C(S)-S-) and combinations thereof.<br>
[0035]	The molecular weight of the polyisocyanate can vary. In certain<br>
embodiments, the number average molecular weight (Mn) of each can be at least 100<br>
grams/mole, or at least 150 grams/mole, or less than 15,000 grams/mole, or less than 5000 grams/mole. The number average molecular weight can be determined using known methods. The number average molecular weight values recited herein can be determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards.<br>

limited to, aliphatic polyisocyanates, cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates wherein one or more of the isocyanato groups are attached directly to the cycloaliphatic ring, cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates wherein one or more of the isocyanato groups are not attached directly to the cycloaliphatic ring, aromatic polyisocyanates wherein one or more of the isocyanato groups are attached directly to the aromatic ring, and aromatic polyisocyanates wherein one or more of the isocyanato groups are not attached directly to the aromatic ring. In certain embodiments, the polyisocyanate does not comprise an aliphatic polyisocyanate.<br>
[0037]	In certain embodiments, the polyisocyanate includes, but is not limited to,<br>
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diisocyanates, aromatic diisocyanates, cyclic dimers and cyclic trimers thereof, and mixtures thereof.

[0038]	In certain embodiments, the polyisocyanate includes dicyclohexylmethane<br>
diisocyanate and/or isomeric mixtures thereof. As used herein, the term "isomeric mixtures" refers to a mixture of the cis-cis, trans-trans, and cis-trans isomers of the polyisocyanate. Non-limiting examples of isomeric mixtures for use in the present invention include the trans-trans isomer of 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate), hereinafter referred to as "PICM" (paraisocyanato cyclohexylmethane), the cis-trans isomer of PICM, the cis-cis isomer of PICM, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0039]	Three suitable isomers of 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) for<br>
use in the present invention are shown below.<br>

As used herein, the term "sprayable" refers to compositions that can be applied in a continuous film that adheres to a substrate in a single pass using a spray gun, such as a high volume-low pressure (HVLP) spray gun, such that the film provides a layer thick enough (believed to be about 20 to 120 mils) to prevent leakage of the contents out of an aircraft fuel tank during the environmental conditions experienced by the fuel tank.<br>
[0096]	The foregoing sealant or potting formulations are often cured at ambient<br>
temperature and pressure, however the formulations generally can be cured at a temperature ranging from 0°C to 100°C. It has been surprisingly discovered that, in at least some embodiments of the present invention, sealant compositions that comprise a polythioether and which are: (a) substantially free of volatile organic compounds; (b) sprayable; and (c) fuel resistant, can be provided. As a result, the present invention is also directed to such sealant compositions.<br>
 [0097]	As used herein, the term "fuel resistant" means that the compositions of<br>
the present invention, when applied to a substrate and cured, can provide a cured sealant that has a percent volume swell of not greater than 40%, in some cases not greater than 25%, in some cases not greater than 20% after immersion for one week at 140°F (60°C) and ambient pressure in jet reference fluid (JRF) type 1 according to methods similar to those described in ASTM D792 or AMS 3269, incorporated herein by reference. Jet reference fluid JRF type 1, as employed herein for determination of fuel resistance, has the following composition (see AMS 2629, issued Jul. 1, 1989), §3.1.1 et seq., available from SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers, Warrendale, Pa.) (that is incorporated herein by reference): herein by reference):<br>
Toluene	28 ± 1% by volume<br>
Cyclohexane (technical)	34 + 1% by volume<br>
Isooctane	38 ± 1% by volume<br>
Tertiary dibutyl disulfide	1 + 0.005% by volume<br>
(doctor sweet)<br>
[0098]	In certain embodiments, cured sealants of the present invention have a<br>
glass transition temperature (Tg) that is not higher than -50°C, in some cases from -50°C to -60°C, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
[0099]	In certain embodiments, cured sealants of the present invention have good<br>
low temperature flexibility as determined by known methods, for example, by the methods described in AMS (Aerospace Material Specification) 3267 §4.5.4.7, MIL-S (Military Specification) -8802E §3.3.12 and MIL-S-29574, and by methods similar to those described in ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D522-88, which are incorporated herein by reference. Cured formulations having good low temperature flexibility are desirable in aerospace applications because the formulations are subjected to wide variations in environmental conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and physical conditions such as joint contraction and expansion and vibration.<br>
[00100]	In certain embodiments, sealant compositions of the present invention<br>
also cure relatively quickly under ambient conditions. For example, in certain embodiments, the sealant compositions provide a tack free film in no more than 1 hour, in some cases no more than ½ hour, after application and cure in ambient conditions.<br>
For purposes of the present invention tack free time is measured in accordance with the procedure described in AMS 3265B, § 3.6.8, test procedure AS5127/1, § 5.8.<br>
[00101]	In certain embodiments, sealant compositions of the present invention<br>
provide a cured sealant having an elongation of at least 100% and a tensile strength of at least 500 psi when measured in accordance with the procedure described in AMS 3279, § 3.3.17.1, test procedure AS5127/1, § 7.7.<br>
[00102]	In certain embodiments, sealant compositions of the present invention<br>
provide a cured sealant having a lap shear strength of greater than 200 psi, in some cases at least 400 psi when measured according to the procedure described in BSS 7272.<br>
[00103]	As should be apparent from the foregoing description, the present<br>
invention is also directed to methods for sealing an aperture utilizing a composition of the present invention. These methods comprise (a) applying a composition of the present invention to a surface to seal and aperture; and (b) allowing the composition to cure under, for example, ambient conditions. As will also be appreciated, the present invention is also directed to aerospace vehicles comprising at least one surface coated with a coating composition of the present invention as well as aerospace vehicles comprising at least on aperture that is sealed with a sealant composition of the present invention.<br>
[00104]	Illustrating the invention are the following examples, which, however, are<br>
not to be considered as limiting the invention to their details. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages in the following examples, as well as throughout the specification, are by weight.<br>
EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1: Synthesis of Mercaptan-Capped Polythioether<br>
[00105]	A 5 liter 4-neck flask was charged with 2254.49 g (12.37 moles) of<br>
dimercaptodioxaoctane (DMDO). The flask was flushed with nitrogen, the contents were heated to 60°C and, under stirring, a solution of 1.61 g (0.008 mole) of radical initiator Vazo-67 [2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) in 1771.35 g (11.20 moles) of diethylene glycol divinyl ether (DEG-DVE) was added over a period of 5.5 hr while<br>
maintaining the temperature at 60-65°C. The mixture was then stirred at 70°C for an additional 1.5 hr. To complete the reaction, nine portions of Vazo-67 (each 0.901 g, 0.0046 mole) were added at one-hour intervals while the temperature of die reaction mixture was maintained at 70°C. The contents were heated at 90°C for 2 hr, cooled to 70°C and evacuated at 10 mmHg for 1 hr to give a faint yellow, liquid polythioether (4025.84 g; Yield: 100%); having an equivalent weight of 1702 and a viscosity of 54 poise (measured at a temperature of about 25 °C and a pressure of about 760 mm Hg according to ASTM D-2849 §79-90 using a Brookfield CAP 2000 viscometer).<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of Isocvanate-Capped Polythioether<br>
[00106]	A 5 liter 4-neck flask was charged with 1932.62 g (0.59 mole) of the<br>
mercaptan-capped polythioether of Example 1, the reaction flask was evacuated at 1 mmHg for 0.5 hr and vacuum was released under nitrogen. Rubinate 9433, (1210.44 g, 4.54 moles, modified diphenylmethane diisocyanate, a Huntsman International product) was added and mixed for 15 min. Polycat 8 (0.94 g, 0.008 mole, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, a product of Air Products) was added as a base catalyst. A mild exotherm developed and raised the reaction temperature to 37°C. Without external heating, stirring was continued at 37-39°C for 0.75 hr. Reaction mixture was heated at 39-50°C for 2 hr. The mercaptan equivalent weight of the reaction mixture was 117,660 at this stage. The reaction mixture was evacuated at 46°C/10 mmHg for 1 hr. After releasing the vacuum under nitrogen, benzoyl chloride (1.26 g, 0.009 mole), a stabilizer, was added and stirred for 10 min. The reaction product was yellow in color; has an NCO equivalent weight of 415 and a viscosity of 148 poise (measured at a temperature of about 25°C and a pressure of about 760 mm Hg according to ASTM D-2849 §79-90 using a Brookfield CAP 2000 viscometer).<br>
Example 3: Synthesis of Amine-capped Polythioether<br>
[00107]	A 3 liter 4-neck flask was charged with 1703.46 (1.47 moles) of<br>
Permapol® L-5534, an epoxy-capped polythioether commercially available from PRC-DeSoto International, Inc., and 628.52 (2.94 moles) of Ethacure 300, a diamine from Huntsman Inc. The contents were mixed under vacuum (10 mmHg) for 0.25 hr. Polycat<br>
8 (0.47 g, 0.0037 mole) was added and the mixture was heated at 84-92°C for 10 hr. The product was light brown in color and had a viscosity of 6 poise (measured at a temperature of about 25°C and a pressure of about 760 mm Hg according to ASTM D-2849 §79-90 using a Brookfield CAP 2000 viscometer).<br>
Example 4: Preparation of Sprayable Sealant Formulation<br>
[00108]	Part A of the sealant composition was prepared by mixing 300 grams of<br>
the isocyanale capped polythioether of Example 2 with 85 grams of Caprolactone. Part B of the sealant composition was prepared by mixing 191.6 grams of the amine capped polythioether of Example 3 with 2.9 grams of black pigment paste and 2.5 grams of Silquest A-1100 (-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, commercially available from OSi Specialties).<br>
[00109]	The sealant was made for testing by mixing Part A and Part B in the<br>
weights indicated above or spraying through a static mixer at 2 parts A to 1 part B by volume. A sealant prepared from the above composition exhibited the properties set forth in Table 1.<br>
