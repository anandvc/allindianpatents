Method and device for handling user equipment in a communications network<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for handling user equipment in a<br>
telecommunications network with two different access networks, wherein user<br>
equipment is capable of being served by both of the networks and wherein the<br>
access networks provide at least one service with a different quality.<br>
Related art<br>
Nowadays, user equipment is developed, that is capable of connecting to at least<br>
two access networks, a so-called dual mode terminal. Such dual mode terminal is<br>
capable of connecting to for example so-called 2G networks like GSM (Global<br>
System for Mobile communication), D-AMPS (Digital Advanced Mobile Phone<br>
System) or PDC (Pacific Digital Cellular) and so-called 3G networks like UTRAN<br>
(UMTS [Universal Mobile Telecommunications System] Terrestrial Radio Access<br>
Network. A UTRAN can be implemented for example according to WCDMA<br>
(Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple<br>
Access), or EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution.<br>
For operators providing telecommunication services, it is interesting whether to<br>
offer services via a 2G or a 3G system to a subscriber using such equipment. In the<br>
following the words terminal and user equipment are used as synonyms. To provide<br>
the best possible service to the highest number of subscribers, or in order to reduce<br>
cost, some mechanisms have been developed.<br>
A first mechanism is the so-called camp on WCDMA mechanism, wherein<br>
WCDMA stands as an example for the described 3G access technologies. At the<br>
camp on WCDMA, a 3G and a 2G access network are configured to direct dual<br>
mode terminals to WCDMA coverage, as long as a terminal is in a so-called Idle<br>
Mode, as soon as WCDMA Coverage quality is good enough for 3G services. In an<br>
idle mode, a terminal can be activated for a telecommunications service but is<br><br>
currently not actively delivering such service. Camp on WCDMA thus means that<br>
once access networks are configured that way, all dual mode terminals will be<br>
directed to WCDMA coverage in Idle Mode.<br>
Partial Roaming can be used to further regulate the Idle Mode load distribution<br>
based on IMSI and/or subscription information.<br>
To reduce 3G load, a mechanism called Move Speech Calls to GSM access has been<br>
developed. Like WCDMA above, GSM is just one example of a 2G access<br>
technology. At that mechanism, a dual mode terminal, being in Idle mode and<br>
served by a 3G access network, receiving a speech call is transferred to a 2G access<br>
network for operating the call. In general Service and Load based handovers can be<br>
used to balance the load based on access network load and requested service in<br>
Connected Mode.<br>
Since Camp on WCDMA directs all Dual Mode terminals to 3G coverage, further<br>
mechanisms are required to regulate distribution of dual mode terminals in Idle<br>
Mode. One of them is Partial Roaming. When an Operator has same MNC (Mobile<br>
Network Code) for WCDMA and GSM, Partial Roaming can be used to reject a 2G<br>
only subscriber from 3G access. This will tell the terminal to stay with the same<br>
mobile network but change Location Area hence direct this terminal to 2G access of<br>
the same Operator. Partial Roaming requires different location area identifier<br>
settings for GSM and WCDMA access.<br>
A further mechanism is National Roaming Restriction. When an Operator has<br>
different MNCs for 3G and 2G, National Roaming Restriction can be used. When<br>
National Roaming Restriction is used, a terminal can select any other mobile<br>
network, not necessarily the GSM access of the same Operator, if more 2G<br>
networks are available.<br>
Yet another mechanism is Load Based Inter-system Handover. Load Based Inter-<br>
system Handover supports intersystem handover of e.g. speech calls based on cell<br>
load of current cell and target cell.<br><br>
Core Network transfers cell load information between 2G access network node and<br>
3G access network node. Access network takes the handover decision, comparing<br>
the Cell Load Information received from target system with the Cell Load<br>
Information of own cells.<br>
If for example the 2G access network is operating according to GSM standards and<br>
the 3G access network is operating according WCDMA standards, then, in the case<br>
that the WCDMA network is loaded and the GSM network has capacity to handle<br>
calls, speech calls can be used for load balancing. For example a speech call set up<br>
in the WCDMA access network can be handed over to GSM network based on cell<br>
load information of the current WCDMA access network cell and the target GSM<br>
access network cell.<br>
Speech is a preferred call type that can be used for load balancing, since it is<br>
supported with alike quality by both technologies and with its high volume, it will<br>
for sure provide load balancing without need to do any complicated CS (Circuit<br>
Switched)/PS (Packet Switched) data inter-system handovers.<br>
However, current technology of load based inter-system handover has some<br>
drawbacks. If an Operator uses speech calls in a 3G network for load balancing, and<br>
a subscriber is handed over to 2G, said subscriber cannot receive high rate packet<br>
switched data as long as he is served by the 2G access network. DTM (Dual<br>
Transfer Mode) enables simultaneous speech and PS calls in GSM access as well,<br>
but with lower rates.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the invention to overcome the drawbacks of prior art.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This will be solved advantageously by the method of claim 1, the device of claim 7,<br>
the database of claim 9, and the network node of claim 10.	<br>
It is advantageous that a group of preferred user equipment is defined for inter-<br>
system handover. This enables to select user equipment for being handed over with<br><br>
lower granularity. Advantageous is the use of a database for storing subscriber data<br>
for storing the indication of preferred user equipment. Such database is commonly<br>
used to store subscriber related information and therefore an implementation can be<br>
done with few adaptations on protocols. Also advantageous is the use of a network<br>
node performing an analysis of user identification, as an indication of a preferred<br>
user equipment can be implemented by means of selecting certain sequences of user<br>
identification for preferred user equipment.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments can be derived from the dependent claims. It is<br>
particularly advantageous that user equipment is transferred, that is limited it its<br>
service capabilities according to claims 3 and 4. As the use equipment is transferred<br>
from a first network with higher service capabilities to a second network with lower<br>
service capabilities it is advantageous that preferably user equipment with<br>
capabilities that are limited to what can be offered by the second network are<br>
transferred. By this, a higher amount of services can be offered compared to a case<br>
when user equipment with higher service capabilities would have been transferred.<br>
Also advantageous is that user equipment is transferred with higher service<br>
capabilities according to claims 5 and 6. If user equipment is transferred form a first<br>
network with lower service capabilities to a second network with higher service<br>
capabilities, this should be done with user equipment having higher service<br>
capabilities. Thus, use equipment with an active call that is transferred is enabled to<br>
use further services, which are provided by the second network exclusively.<br>
It is object of the invention to provide a method for handling user equipment in a<br>
communications network comprising at least a first access network and a second<br>
network for enabling user equipment to access the network and a core network for<br>
connecting said user equipment. The access network have at least partially<br>
overlapping service areas, and user equipment located in the overlapping part can be<br>
transferred from the first to the second access network. The method comprises the<br>
following steps, receiving an indication of a request for transferring at least one<br>
terminal, checking a transfer permission parameter value associated to a terminal,<br><br>
determining that the transfer permission parameter value indicates that a transfer of<br>
the associated user equipment is permitted, initiating the transfer of the terminal<br>
from the first to the second access network. The method comprises the step of<br>
determining that the user equipment does not belong to a group of user equipment,<br>
for which a preferred access network has been defined.<br>
In an embodiment of the method, an access network operates according to the<br>
. standards defined for of one of a Global System for Mobile Communications,<br>
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access, Code Division Multiple Access, and<br>
Enhanced Data Rates for Global System for Mobile Communications Evolution.<br>
The group of user equipment for which a preferred access network has been defined<br>
can comprise user equipment with service capabilities can be limited to services that<br>
correspond to services supported by the second network.<br>
The group of user equipment for which a preferred access network has been defined<br>
can comprise user equipment used associated to a subscription with permitted<br>
services limited to services that correspond to services supported by the second<br>
network.<br>
The group of user equipment for which a preferred access network has been defined<br>
can also comprise user equipment used associated to a subscription for that services<br>
are permitted that are not supported by the first network.<br>
Furthermore can the group of user equipment for which a preferred access network<br>
has been defined comprise user equipment with service capabilities corresponding<br>
to services that are not supported by the first network.<br>
The invention is also related to a device for selecting user equipment to be<br>
transferred from a first access network to a second access network. Said device<br>
comprises an input output unit for sending and receiving messages, a processing<br>
unit for controlling the other units, a storage, and a determining unit for determining<br><br>
whether a transmission of a user equipment is permitted. The logical unit is adapted<br>
to determine whether a user equipment belongs to a group of user equipment, for<br>
which a preferred access network has been defined.<br>
The device can comprise a logical unit that determines whether a user equipment<br>
belongs to said group by means of analysing a transfer permission parameter value<br>
associated to the user equipment.<br>
It is also object of the invention to provide a database for storing subscriber related<br>
data containing an input/output unit for sending and receiving messages, a<br>
processing unit for controlling the database and a storage for storing subscriber<br>
related data. The storage of the database is adapted to store information whether a<br>
user equipment used by a subscriber belongs to a group of user equipment, for<br>
which a preferred access network has been defined.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a network node for performing a<br>
subscriber identification analysis. The network node comprises electronic circuitry<br>
for determining whether a user equipment belongs to a group of user equipment, for<br>
which a preferred access network has been defined.<br>
According to the invention, load based inter-system handover is further developed<br>
so that a maximum of services can be provided to a maximum of user equipment.<br>
To this end a new indication of user terminals that are preferred at inter-system<br>
handover is introduced. According to this indication a selection is performed for<br>
inter-system handover, for example at overload condition. User equipment that<br>
camps on 3G or camps on 2G, that is user equipment in an idle state is served by a<br>
2G or a 3G access network, is handed over to the respective other network when a<br>
service request is received. If use equipment camps on 2G, it will be handed over<br>
when it is capable of services provided by 3G only. Such service can be for example<br>
high speed data, video or alike. If use equipment camps on 3G, it will preferably<br>
handed over if it is capable only of services that can also be provided by 2G like<br>
speed or data transmission that does not exceed 2G's capabilities. A device,<br><br>
preferably located in a Core Network decides or indicates to an access network,<br>
which at least one user equipment is subject to load balancing and which user<br>
equipment should be kept in the access network it is currently located.<br>
To that end differentiation of user equipment is required. It can be done, very<br>
similar to Partial Roaming, either with a user identification like the IMSI<br>
(International Mobile Subscriber Identification) analysis or with subscriber related<br>
data stored in a database like an AAA (Access, Accounting and Authorisation)<br>
server, an HLR home location register, or a home subscriber server. Two factors can<br>
limit the services provided to user equipment, the subscription and the user<br>
equipment capabilities. A subscription can be limited to particular services as well<br>
as user equipment capabilities. To indicate that limitation a predefined user<br>
identification, for example a certain number range can be used. Alternatively this<br>
information can be stored in a database, for example in a transmission permission<br>
parameter.<br>

The following figures show:<br>

Detailed description<br>
In the following the invention will be further described by means of examples and<br>
by means of figures.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a flow diagram of a method according to the invention. In a first step<br>
101 the method is started. In a next step 102 an indication of a transfer request is<br>
received. Such indication can be for example an operator setting that for any user<br>
equipment, or for any user equipment for that a particular service request is received<br>
the subsequent steps shall be performed. The indication can also be sent by a node<br><br>
determining a load condition like overload or reaching of a predefined threshold<br>
value. A third way of receiving can be a comparison of load at cell level of any<br>
higher level of the access networks, wherein the result of the comparison is that user<br>
terminal shall be transferred. The next step 103 is the beginning of a loop, this step<br>
is optional.<br>
In a following step 104 a transmission permission parameter is checked, whether its<br>
value permits the transfer of associated user equipment or not. The transmission<br>
permission parameter can be received for example from a database storing<br>
subscriber related data or from a network node performing a user identification<br>
analysis. In a next step 105 it is determined that a transfer is permitted. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention it is implemented that if it is determined that a transfer<br>
is not permitted, the method ends. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at<br>
least the following five parameter values are implemented. "GSM restricted", i.e. in<br>
Idle and Connected Mode the terminal is not permitted to be served by a GSM<br>
network. It should be noted that GSM is still an example for any 2G network.<br>
Therefore any other access technology could be used instead of GSM. This applies<br>
to the rest of the description, too. The parameter can be used for example for Partial<br>
Roaming and Service Handover.<br>
The second parameter value is "WCDMA restricted". This means in Idle and<br>
Connected Mode the terminal is not permitted to be served by a WCDMA network.<br>
It should be noted that WCDMA is just one example for a 3G access technology,<br>
and that any other 3G access technology could be used instead. This applies to the<br>
rest of the description, too. The parameter can for example be used for Partial<br>
Roaming and Service Handover.<br>
A newly introduced parameter value is "WCDMA Preferred". This value indicates a<br>
terminal that may be served in an Idle mode by any of the access networks, but in<br>
Connected Mode WCDMA is the preferred technology. User equipment associated<br>
to this parameter value are not subject of Partial Roaming. No load based inter-<br>
system handovers should be performed. This value is assigned to user equipment<br><br>
capable of services that are supported by the preferred access network but not by the<br>
respective other access network, an wherein the a subscriber using that user<br>
equipment subscribed to said services.<br>
A further newly introduced parameter value is "GSM Preferred". This means that in<br>
an Idle Mode no restriction apply, but in a Connected Mode GSM is the preferred<br>
technology. User equipment associated to this parameter value are not subject of<br>
Partial Roaming. No load based inter-system handovers should be performed. This<br>
value is assigned to user equipment that is not capable of services supported by the<br>
respective other access network but not by the indicated one, or wherein the user of<br>
the user equipment did not subscribe to such services.<br>
The fifth value is "No Restriction, No Preference". This is, Partial Roaming shall<br>
not be performed for these user equipment, but Load Based Inter-systems handovers<br>
are permitted.<br>
In a next step 106 it is determined that the user equipment does not belong to a<br>
group of terminals for which a preferred access network has been defined. This can<br>
be implemented for example by determining that the parameter value is not "GSM<br>
preferred" or "WCDMA preferred". In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
steps of determining that a transfer is permitted and determining that the user<br>
equipment does not belong to a group of user equipment for which a preferred<br>
access network has been defined are executed in a single step.<br>
In a next step 107 the transferring of the user equipment is initiated. This can be<br>
implemented for example by sending a message to the access network the user<br>
equipment shall be transferred to.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a device according to the invention. The device (DEV2) comprises<br>
an input output unit (IOU2) for sending and receiving messages, a processing unit<br>
(PU2) for controlling the other units, a storage (ST02), and a determining unit<br>
(DU2) for detennining whether a transmission of a user equipment is permitted, and<br>
a logical unit (LU2) adapted to determine whether a user equipment belongs to a<br><br>
group of user equipment for which a preferred access network has been defined. The<br>
units can be implemented by means of software, hardware or a combination of both.<br>

node. The device is adapted to perform the method as described for figure 1.<br><br>
