				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a heat exchanger valve control top part, particularly a radiator valve thermostat top part, with an actuation device interacting with a valve element, an electrical consumer and an electrical energy supply device.<br>
In the following, the invention is described by way of a radiator valve thermostat top part as an example of a control top part. However, it cannot only be used with radiators, but in principle also with other heat exchangers used for room air-conditioning, for example cooling ceilings or the like.<br>
In such a control top part, the actuation device exists in the form of a thermostat element, whose volume changes with the temperature. When the room temperature increases, the thermostat element expands and displaces the valve element in the direction of the valve seat, so that the flow of heating fluid is throttled. With a reduction of the room temperature, the valve element is lifted off from the valve seat, so that a larger amount of heating fluid can flow through the radiator.<br>
For the desired value adjustment, for example the position of the thermostat element can be changed, or the length of an actuation string between the thermostat element and the tappet, which at the end actuates the valve element, can be changed. For this purpose, for example, an electric motor is provided, which here forms the electrical consumer.<br>
The motor and its control, however, require electrical energy. This can be supplied through cables connecting the top part to an external energy source. However, there is reluctance against using such a solution, as the cables cause an additional installation effort.<br>
This additional installation effort can be remedied by the use of one or more batteries. However, a substantial space will be required for the accommodation of the batteries.<br>
A control top part as mentioned in the introduction is known from DE 93 12 588 Ul. Here, a panel with solar cells is provided in addition to an accumulator, that is, a rechargeable battery. Basically, the solar cells provide the electrical energy required to operate the adjustment device. However, it would only be possible to operate the adjustment device in daylight. The accumulator ensures that an adjustment can also be made at night. However, also here a substantial space will be required for the accommodation of the accumulator.<br><br>
The invention is based on the task of keeping the outer dimensions of the control top part as small as possible.<br>
With a heat exchanger valve control top part as mentioned in the introduction, this task is solved in that the energy supply device has a thermoelectric generator.<br>
A thermoelectric generator works, for example, according to the so-called "Seebeck effect". It contains two different metals or semi-conductors, whose transitions are kept at different temperatures. A voltage caused by a so-called thermoelectric effect then occurs between the different materials. The Seebeck effect is the opposite of the Peltier effect, in which a current flow causes a temperature difference in a connection of different metals. When, now, the Seebeck effect is used in a control top part for a heat exchanger, the temperature leap available with each heat exchanger, which exists between the ambient temperature and the temperature of the heat exchanger or a heat carrying medium flowing through the heat exchanger, is utilised in a simple manner. As such a temperature difference is practically always available in connection with a heat exchanger - with very few exceptions - the required electrical energy is also almost always available, with which the adjustment device can be actuated. A thermoelectric generator requires only little space. In particular, it can be made relatively flat, so that the outer dimensions of the control top part can be kept small. The electrical consumer can here have the form of an adjustment device, with which an active connection between the actuation device and the valve element can be changed. Additionally or instead of the adjustment device, the electrical consumer can also simply be made as electronics, which performs certain control tasks or determines simple measuring values, which are passed on to a superior control device. When the control top part is used together with a motor valve, the electrical consumer can also be the motor of the valve, by means of which the valve element is adjusted. In many cases, the thermostat top part has a display showing certain parameters, for example the actual temperature or a desired temperature. This display can also be the electrical consumer.<br>
Preferably, on one side the generator is connected in a heat conductive manner to a housing, through which a heat carrying fluid can flow, and has on the other side a cooling member. By means of the cooling member, it can be ensured that on one side the thermoelectrical generator assumes practically room temperature, on the other side the temperature of the heat carrying<br><br>
medium is generated, so that by means of a temperature difference between the heat carrying medium and the room temperature, the required electrical energy can be generated. In most cases, the temperature difference between the heat carrying medium and the room temperature is sufficient to generate the required energy.<br>
Preferably, the generator is connected in a heat conductive manner to a valve housing. In a radiator or cooling ceiling valve the valve housing is available anyway. It follows the temperature of the heat carrying medium quickly and with a relatively small difference. In this case, additional, external components are practically not required.<br>
It is preferred that the generator is located inside the top part and that a heat conducting path leads into the top part. In this case, the top part can remain more or less unchanged with regard to its outer dimensions. The heat conducting path is thermally isolated, so that basically only the generator is supplied with heat. A radiation of heat into the housing, however, is avoided.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, it may be ensured that the generator is located outside the top part. In this case the inside of the top part can also remain unchanged in relation to traditional top parts, so that a rearrangement of the production is not required. Outside the top part, the freedom of locating the thermoelectrical generator is larger. Finally, an enlargement of the manufactured size is not involved.<br>
It is also advantageous, when the generator is connected to a pipe section in a heat conducting manner. Also the pipe section usually adopts the temperature of the heat carrying medium. In this case, it is not required to connect the thermoelectrical generator to the valve housing.<br>
It is preferred that the pipe section is provided with a tightened ring, which is connected in a heat conducting manner to the generator. The tightening of the ring, which can have the form of a clamp, causes a sufficient heat transfer from the pipe section via the heat conducting path to the thermoelectrical generator.<br>
Preferably, the generator is arranged in an enclosure, which has at least one opening for the passing of room air. When the top part is used with a radiator, the room air acts as cooling air, which causes the required temperature difference to the temperature of the heat carrying medium.<br><br>
Preferably, the generator is connected to a voltage amplifier. When, for space reasons, the thermoelectrical generator is only used with small dimensions, it supplies a correspondingly small voltage, which will in many cases not be sufficient to drive the adjustment device. On the other hand, the thermoelectrical generator supplies a sufficient electrical power, so that with a corresponding amplification the voltage can be obtained, which enables the generator to operate the adjustment device directly.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the voltage amplifier is made as a d.c./d.c. amplifier. In a manner known per se, such a d.c./d.c. amplifier can be made of electronic components, so that no transformer is required, which again takes up a correspondingly large space.<br>
Preferably, the electric energy supply device additionally has a photovoltaic device. A photovoltaic device converts light energy into electrical energy. A known embodiment of such a photovoltaic device is the so-called solar cells. However, generally a photovoltaic device is not limited to sunlight as energy source. In a particularly advantageous manner, the combination of a thermoelectrical generator and a photovoltaic device utilises the environmental conditions, which are usually available during heating. When, during summer, little heating energy is required, the thermoelectric generator accordingly only providing smaller temperature differences and supplying little electrical energy, a sufficient amount of light is usually available, so that the adjustment device can be operated via the photovoltaic device. During winter, the light gain is usually smaller. On the other hand, the temperature difference available for driving the thermoelectric generator is sufficient to deliver the electrical energy in a thermal manner. Particularly in connection with a voltage amplifier the photovoltaic device has a special advantage: The voltage amplifier usually requires a certain pre-voltage for the "start". This can now be provided by the photovoltaic device, also when only little light is available. With regard to power, this voltage, which is required to start the voltage amplifier, does not have to be heavily loadable.<br>
Preferably, the photovoltaic device has at least one light-sensitive element, which is mounted on an outside of the enclosure, in which the generator is located. Thus, also with regard to component groups, the thermoelectric generator is combined with the light-sensitive element. When exposed to light, the light-sensitive element supplies an electrical energy.<br>
Preferably, the photovoltaic device forms a voltage supply device for the voltage amplifier. Particularly in connection with a voltage amplifier, the photovoltaic device has a special, advantage: For the "start" the voltage amplifier usually requires a certain pre-voltage. This can now be supplied by the photovoltaic device, also when only little light is available. With regard to power, this voltage, which is required to start the voltage amplifier, does not have to be heavily loadable.<br>
It is also preferred that the light-sensitive element is located on the fiont side of the top part or on a surface pointing in the same direction. When the top part is used as twist handle, the front side always points in the same direction, that is, is not exposed to a different orientation when actuated. Also another surface pointing in the same direction can be used to locate the light-sensitive element.<br><br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a heat exchanger valve control top part, particularly a radiator valve thermostat top part, with an actuation device interacting with a valve element, an electrical consumer and an energy supply device, characterized in that the energy supply device has a thermoelectric generator.<br>
In the following, the invention is described on the basis of preferred embodiments in connection with the drawings, showing:<br>
Fig. 1	a first embodiment of a thermostat valve top part<br>
Fig. 2	a second embodiment of a thermostat valve top part<br>
Fig. 3	a third embodiment of a thermostat valve top part<br>
Fig. 1 shows a radiator valve thermostat top part 1, which is fixed on a valve housing 2 of a radiator valve. In a manner known per se, a valve seat 5 is located in the valve housing 2 between an inlet 3 and an outlet 4, the valve seat 5 interacting with a valve element 6. The valve element 6 is moved away from the valve seat 5 in the opening direction by means of an opening spring 7. A tappet 8 is provided to move the valve element 6 in the direction of the valve seat 5, thus contributing to a throttling of the heat carrying fluid from inlet 3 to outlet 4.<br>
An actuating pin 9 acts upon the tappet 8, the actuating pin 9 being guided through a stuffing box 10. An intermediary member 11 acts upon the actuating pin 9. The intermediary member 11 has a top part 12 and a bottom part 13, which engage each other via a threaded pairing 14. For this purpose, the bottom part 13 is held unrotatably, whereas the top part 12 can be rotated <br>
in relation to the bottom part 13. A rotation of the top part in relation to the bottom part 13 causes a change of the active length of the intermediary member 11.<br>
A thermostat element 15, which moves a tappet 16 more or less far in the direction of the valve seat 5 in dependence of an ambient temperature, acts upon the intermediary member 11. Depending on the length of the intermediary member 11 this causes a more or less heavy throttling when the temperature is unchanged. This means that a desired value can be adjusted via the length of the intermediary member 11. Another possibility of adjusting the desired value involves the turning of a handle 17 of the top part 1 in relation to a base part 18.<br>
For changing the active length of the intermediary member 11 an adjustment device 19 is provided, which has a motor 20, only shown schematically, that acts upon the top part 12 of the intermediary member 11 via a gearing, thus rotating the top part 12 in relation to the bottom part 13. For this purpose, the base part 18 has an opening 21, through which the motor can engage inside the base part 18.<br>
The motor 20 requires a supply of electrical energy. A thermoelectric generator 22 is provided to generate the electrical energy. This thermoelectric generator 22 works according to the so-called "Seebeck effect", that is, it generates a voltage in a device, which comprises two different materials, for example two different metals or two different semi-materials, in which the transitions between these materials are maintained at different temperatures. This effect was discovered by the German physics Thomas Seebeck (1770 to 1831). It is also called the "thermoelectrical effect". Its counterpart in the opposite direction is found in the Peltier effect, in which a current flow causes a temperature difference at the transitions between different metals.<br>
One side of the thermoelectric generator 22 is connected to a cooling member 23, which more or less adapts the temperature of the thermoelectric generator 22 on that side to the ambient temperature. To obtain an exchange of air and thus with the ambient temperature, the base part 18 has an opening 24 here. If required, it is also possible to provide several oppositely arranged openings 24 to permit an air flow.<br>
The base part 18 is fixed on a carrying arrangement 25 that is fixed on the valve housing 2. Such a fixing can, for example, be made by jamming or screwing. A holder 26 of a heat<br><br>
conductive material, for example a metal, like copper, branches off from the carrying arrangement. This holder 26 carries the other side of the generator 22, so that the generator 22 is exposed to the difference between on the one side the temperature of the valve housing 2 and thus of the heat carrying medium flowing through the valve housing 2 and on the other side the room air. The temperature difference can easily be in the range of several 10°, so that by means of the temperature difference an electrical power with a sufficient size can be generated. If required, the holder 26 can be isolated towards the inside of the base part 18. This reduces a thermal influence on the thermostat element 15 and a temperature drop between the valve housing 2 and the generator 22. In many cases, it is also favourable to provide a thermal isolation between the holder 26 and the thermostat element 15, for example in the form of a shielding, not shown in detail.<br>
As, however, the generator 22 should only have a relatively small base surface to avoid an increase of its dimensions, there is a risk that the voltage generated by the generator 22 is too small. For this reason, a voltage amplifier 27 is arranged in the adjustment device 19, the voltage amplifier 27 being connected to the generator 22. For reasons of clarity, the electrical cables required for this connection are not shown in detail. The voltage amplifier 27 is a d.c./d.c. amplifier. It has an amplification factor of, for example, 50, so that with a voltage of 0.06 Volts generated by the thermoelectric generator 22, an output voltage of approximately 3 Volts can be obtained. These 3 Volts will be sufficient to activate the motor 20. A voltage of 3 Volts corresponds to the voltage of two small batteries of the type AAA.<br>
Additionally, a light-sensitive element 28 of a photovoltaic device is located on the front side of the top part. The light-sensitive element 28 generates an electrical voltage, when it is exposed to light radiation. The light-sensitive element 28 can then be used as voltage source or voltage supply device for the voltage amplifier 27, so that the voltage amplifier 27 can start, when it requires an auxiliary voltage for such a start.<br>
The combination of thermoelectric generator 22 and light-sensitive element 28 particularly considers the outer conditions available in a heating system: In winter there is a relatively large temperature difference between the ambient air and the heat carrying medium, so that the thermoelectric generator 22 can supply the electrical power required to operate the adjustment device 19. Thus, it can be accepted that the light-sensitive element 28 can only supply a smaller electrical power. In summer, however, the temperature difference between the heat<br><br>
carrying medium and the ambient air is smaller. The thermoelectric generator 22 will thus only supply less electrical power. On the other hand, the light-sensitive element 28 (of course also several light-sensitive elements 28 can be used) can supply a larger electrical power.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, additional space outside the top part 1 is not required. The components adopted in the top part, that is, the thermoelectric generator 22 with the cooling member 23 and the light-sensitive element 28 can be integrated in an available top part with more or less effort.<br>
In an embodiment, which is not shown in detail, the generator 22 can also be located on the outside of the base part 18 or directly on the valve housing 2.<br>
When an external component can be permitted, an embodiment according to Fig. 2 can be used. Here, the same or functionally the same parts have the same reference numbers.<br>
The thermoelectric generator 22 is now no longer located inside the top part 1, but on a pipe clip 29, which is fixed on a connection pipe 30, through which the heat carrying medium is led to the valve housing 2. Also another fixing, for example gluing or soldering, is possible, as long as a sufficient heat transition to the generator 22 is ensured. Accordingly, the connection pipe 30 has practically the temperature of the heat carrying medium. The cooling member is located on the side of the generator 22 lying opposite the pipe clamp 29. The light-sensitive elements 18, which could be called "solar cells" for short, are located on the outside of an enclosure 31, with which the thermoelectric generator is protected. The enclosure 31 again has an opening 24. The thermoelectric generator 22 and the light-sensitive element 28 supply their energy to the adjustment device 19 through an electrical cable 32. Expediently, the voltage amplifier 27 is located here near the thermoelectric generator 22.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a modified embodiment, in which the generator 22 is located inside a housing 33 of the adjustment device 19. The light-sensitive elements 28 are located on a side of the housing 33, which is parallel to the front side 34 of the top part 1. The heat transport to the generator 22 is ensured via a heat conduction rod 35, which again is fixed on the inlet by means of a clamp 29<br><br>
Also the housing 33 has an opening 24 to ensure the contact between the cooling member 23 and the room air.<br><br><br><br><br>
