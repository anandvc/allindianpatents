CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/976,610, filed on October 1, 2007. The disclosure of<br>
the above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines,<br>
and more particularly to air/fuel ratio control systems for internal combustion<br>
engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] In an internal combustion engine (ICE) fuel may be injected into<br>
an intake manifold, for example single port injection per fuel bank, per engine or<br>
multi-ports injection per cylinder. Alternatively or additionally, fuel may be<br>
injected directly into cylinders. The fuel is then mixed with air to form an air/fuel<br>
 <br>
mixture. The air/fuel mixture is combusted to generate torque. The fuel and air<br>
may be controlled such that the engine maintains an air-to-fuel ratio at<br>
stoichiometry. The engine may operate using fuels with different stoichiometric<br>
values, such as a gasoline and ethanol blend. As the percentage of each fuel in<br>
the overall fuel mixture changes, the stoichiometric value may change.<br>
[0005] The stoichiometric value of a fuel mixture may be measured to<br>
allow for optimal operation of the engine based on the particular fuel mixture.<br>
The engine system may change the relative amounts of air and fuel delivered to<br>
the cylinders based on the stoichiometric value for the fuel mixture.<br>
[0006] The volatility or the measure of how quickly fuel vaporizes<br>
changes with the type of fuel and the operating engine temperature. For<br>
example, during cold starts when an engine is at an ambient temperature or is<br>
not up to a normal operating temperature, fuel vaporizes at a reduced rate. This<br>
affects the ability of an engine to maintain a predetermined idle speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] In one exemplary embodiment, a fuel control system is provided<br>
that includes devices that generate parameter signals. The parameter signals<br>
include an engine runtime signal and one or more of an engine load signal, a<br>
temperature signal and a barometric pressure signal. A modification module<br>
generates a modification signal based on the parameter signals. A control<br>
module compensates for a current fuel volatility by adjusting a current air/fuel<br>
mixture of an engine based on the modification signal.<br>
 <br>
[0008] The fuel injection system may include a fuel injector that injects<br>
fuel into one of an intake manifold and a combustion chamber of a cylinder of an<br>
engine. The control module initiates multiple fuel injections in the intake manifold<br>
or combustion chamber during a combustion cycle of the cylinder via the fuel<br>
injector.<br>
[0009] In other features, a fuel control system is provided that includes<br>
an engine runtime indicator, which generates an engine run time signal. An<br>
engine load module generates the engine load signal. A temperature sensor<br>
generates a temperature signal. A barometric pressure sensor generates a<br>
barometric pressure signal. A control module compensates for a current fuel<br>
volatility by adjusting a current air/fuel mixture of an engine based on the engine<br>
run time signal, the engine load signal, the temperature signal, and the<br>
barometric pressure signal.<br>
[0010] In yet other features, a fuel control method includes generating<br>
parameter signals. The parameter signals include an engine runtime signal and<br>
one or more of an engine load signal, a temperature signal and a barometric<br>
pressure signal. Modification signals are generated based on the parameter<br>
signals. A combined signal is generated based on the modification signals. A<br>
current idle speed is adjusted via adjustment in a current air/fuel mixture of an<br>
engine based on the combined signals.<br>
[0011] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
 <br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
 <br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0018] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0019] Also, as used herein, the term combustion cycle refers to the<br>
reoccurring stages of an engine combustion process. For example, in a 4-stroke<br>
internal combustion engine, a single combustion cycle may refer to and include<br>
an intake stroke, a compression stroke, a power stroke and an exhaust stroke.<br>
The four-strokes are continuously repeated during operation of the engine.<br>
[0020] In addition, although the following embodiments are described<br>
primarily with respect to example internal combustion engines, the embodiments<br>
of the present disclosure may apply to other internal combustion engines. For<br>
example, the embodiments of the present disclosure may apply to compression<br>
ignition, spark ignition, homogenous spark ignition, homogeneous charge<br>
compression ignition, stratified spark ignition, and spark assisted compression<br>
ignition engines. The embodiments also apply to diesel engines and<br>
applications. The embodiments further apply to gasoline or high volatility fuel<br>
engines.<br>
 <br>
[0021] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an<br>
internal combustion engine system 50 incorporating fuel volatility compensation<br>
is shown. The engine system 50 is on a vehicle 52 and includes an engine 54,<br>
and a fuel volatility compensation system 55 that includes an air intake control<br>
system 56, a fuel injection system 57, and may include a valve lift control system<br>
58 and an exhaust system 59. The fuel volatility compensation system adjusts<br>
volatility of fuel entering cylinders of the engine. The volatility may be indirectly<br>
adjusted by adjusting an air/fuel ratio for each of the cylinders.<br>
[0022] The engine 54 has cylinders 60. Each cylinder 60 may have<br>
one or more intake valves and/or exhaust valves. Each cylinder 60 also includes<br>
a piston that rides on a crankshaft 62. The engine 54 is configured with at least a<br>
portion of the valve lift control system 58 and may be configured with an ignition<br>
system 64 with an ignition circuit 65. The engine 54 includes an intake manifold<br>
66. The engine 54 combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque.<br>
The engine 54, as shown, includes four cylinders in an in-line configuration.<br>
Although FIG. 2 depicts four cylinders (N = 4), it can be appreciated that the<br>
engine 54 may include additional or fewer cylinders. For example, engines<br>
having 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. It is also<br>
anticipated that the fuel injection control of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a V-type or another type of cylinder configuration.<br>
[0023] An output of the engine 54 is coupled by a torque converter 70,<br>
a transmission 72, a driveshaft 74 and a differential 76 to driven wheels 78. The<br>
transmission 72 may, for example, be a continuously variable transmission (CVT)<br>
 <br>
or a step-gear automatic transmission. The transmission 72 is controlled by a<br>
vehicle control module 80.<br>
[0024] The valve lift control system 58 controls variable opening lift<br>
operation of intake and exhaust valves of the engine 54. The intake and exhaust<br>
valves of the engine 54 may each operate in 2-step, multi-step, or variable lift<br>
modes. The variable valve lift control system 58 operates based on various<br>
characteristics and parameters of the engine 54. The valve lift control system 58<br>
includes an intake and exhaust valve assembly (head) 79, the control module 80,<br>
and various sensors. Some of the sensors are shown in FIGs. 1 and 2. The<br>
control module 80 controls lift operation of intake and exhaust valves of the valve<br>
assembly 79.<br>
[0025] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 66 via an electronic throttle<br>
controller (ETC) 90, or a cable-driven throttle, which adjusts a throttle plate 92<br>
that is located adjacent to an inlet of an intake manifold 66. The adjustment may<br>
be based upon a position of an accelerator pedal 94 and a throttle control<br>
algorithm that is executed by the control module 80. The throttle 92 adjusts<br>
output torque that drives the wheels 78. An accelerator pedal sensor 96<br>
generates a pedal position signal that is output to the control module 80 based<br>
on a position of the accelerator pedal 94. A position of a brake pedal 98 is<br>
sensed by a brake pedal sensor or switch 100, which generates a brake pedal<br>
position signal that is output to the control module 80.<br>
[0026] Air is drawn into the cylinders 60 from the intake manifold 66<br>
and is compressed therein. Fuel is injected into cylinders 60 by the fuel injection<br>
 <br>
circuit 67 and the spark generated by the ignition system 64 ignites the air/fuel<br>
mixtures in the cylinders 60. Exhaust gases are exhausted from the cylinders 60<br>
into the exhaust system 59. In some instances, the engine system 80 can<br>
include a turbocharger that uses an exhaust driven turbine to drive a compressor<br>
that compresses the air entering the intake manifold 66. The compressed air<br>
may pass through an air cooler before entering into the intake manifold 66.<br>
[0027] The fuel injection system 57 includes a fuel injection circuit 67<br>
with fuel injectors that may be associated with each of the cylinders 60 and/or<br>
associated with the intake manifold 66. A fuel rail provides fuel to each of the<br>
fuel injectors after reception from, for example, a fuel pump or reservoir. The<br>
control module 80 controls operation of the fuel injectors including the number<br>
and timing of fuel injections into each of the cylinders 60 and/or the intake<br>
manifold 66 and per combustion cycle thereof. The fuel injection timing may be<br>
relative to crankshaft positioning.<br>
[0028] The ignition system 64 may include spark plugs or other ignition<br>
devices for ignition of the air/fuel mixtures in each of the cylinders 60. The<br>
ignition system 64 also may include the control module 80. The control module<br>
80 may, for example, control spark timing relative to crankshaft positioning.<br>
[0029] The exhaust system 59 may include exhaust manifolds and/or<br>
exhaust conduits, such as the conduit 110 and a filter system 112. The exhaust<br>
manifolds and conduits direct the exhaust exiting the cylinders 60 into filter<br>
system 112. Optionally, an EGR valve re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back<br>
into the intake manifold 66. A portion of the exhaust may be directed into a<br>
 <br>
turbocharger to drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the<br>
fresh air received from the intake manifold 66. A combined exhaust stream flows<br>
from the turbocharger through the filter system 112.<br>
[0030] The filter system 112, shown for a diesel embodiment, may<br>
include a catalytic converter or an oxidation catalyst (OC) 114 and a heating<br>
element 116, as well as a particulate filter, a liquid reductant system and/or other<br>
exhaust filtration system devices. The heating element 116 may be used to heat<br>
the oxidation catalyst 114 during startup of the engine 54 and be controlled by<br>
the control module 80. The liquid reductant may include urea, ammonia, or some<br>
other liquid reductant. Liquid reductant is injected into the exhaust stream to<br>
react with NOx to generate water vapor (H2O) and N2 (nitrogen gas). The<br>
exhaust system, such as in a gasoline engine application, may include tree way<br>
catalysts (TWC) to oxidize hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and to<br>
reduce NOx.<br>
[0031] The valve lift control system 58 further includes an engine<br>
temperature sensor 118 and an exhaust temperature sensor 120. The engine<br>
temperature sensor 118 may detect oil or coolant temperature of the engine 54<br>
or some other engine temperature. The exhaust temperature sensor 120 may<br>
detect temperature of the oxidation catalyst 114 or some other component of the<br>
exhaust system 59. The temperatures of the engine 54 and the exhaust system<br>
59 may be indirectly determined or estimated based on engine and exhaust<br>
operating parameters and/or other temperature signals. Alternatively, the<br>
 <br>
temperatures of the engine 54 and the exhaust system 59 may be determined<br>
directly via the engine and exhaust temperature sensors 118, 120<br>
[0032] Other sensor inputs collectively indicated by reference number<br>
122 and used by the control module 80 include an engine speed signal 124, a<br>
vehicle speed signal 126, a power supply signal 128, oil pressure signal 130, and<br>
a cylinder identification signal 134. The sensor input signals 124-134 are<br>
respectively generated by engine speed sensor 136, vehicle speed sensor 138, a<br>
power supply sensor 140, an oil pressure sensor 142, and cylinder identification<br>
sensor 146. Some other sensor inputs may include an intake manifold pressure<br>
signal, a throttle position signal, a transmission signal, and manifold air<br>
temperature signal.<br>
[0033] The valve lift control system 58 may also include one or more<br>
timing sensors 148. Although the timing sensor 148 is shown as a crankshaft<br>
position sensor, the timing sensor may be a camshaft position sensor, a<br>
transmission sensor, or some other timing sensor. The timing sensor generates<br>
a timing signal that is indicative of position of one or more pistons and/or a<br>
crankshaft.<br>
[0034] The valve lift control system 58 includes an intake/exhaust valve<br>
assembly that receives oil from an oil reservoir via an oil pump. The oil is filtered<br>
prior to reception by the valve assembly. The vehicle control module 80 controls<br>
lift operation of intake and exhaust valves of the valve assembly.<br>
[0035] The valve assembly includes the intake and exhaust valves,<br>
which have open and closed states and are actuated via one or more camshafts.<br>
 <br>
A dedicated intake camshaft and a dedicated exhaust camshaft may be included.<br>
In another embodiment, the intake and exhaust valves share a common<br>
camshaft. When in an open state the intake and exhaust valves may be<br>
operating in various lift modes, some of which are mentioned above. The valve<br>
assembly also includes valve lift mode adjustment devices. The lift mode<br>
adjustment devices may include oil pressure control valves, such as valve lift<br>
control solenoids, lift pins, levers, rockers, springs, locking mechanisms, tappets,<br>
etc.<br>
[0036] The valve lift control system 58 may include an oil temperature<br>
sensor and/or an oil pressure sensor. The control module signals the oil<br>
pressure control valves based on temperature and pressure signals received<br>
from the temperature and pressure sensors.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of a fuel<br>
volatility compensation system 150 is shown. The fuel volatility compensation<br>
system 150 includes a vehicle control module 152. The fuel volatility<br>
compensation system 150 also includes temperature sensors 154, engine<br>
sensors and modules 156, air-related sensors 158, and a pressure sensor 160.<br>
The vehicle control module 152 controls an air intake/injection control system<br>
162, a fuel injection system 164, and may control lift and timing of intake and<br>
exhaust valves 166.<br>
[0038] The temperature sensors 154 include an intake temperature<br>
sensor 168, an engine coolant temperature sensor 170, an engine oil<br>
temperature sensor 172, an ambient temperature sensor 174, and may include<br>
 <br>
other engine temperature sensors. The intake air temperature sensor 168 mg<br>
generate an intake air temperature (IAT) signal. The engine coolant temperater<br>
sensor 170 may generate an engine coolant temperature (ECT) signal. The<br>
engine oil temperature sensor 172 may generate an engine oil temperature (Toil)<br>
signal. The ambient temperature sensor 174 may generate an amount<br>
temperature (AMB) signal.<br>
[0039] The engine sensors and modules 156 include a cylinder air<br>
evaluation module 180, an engine output torque sensor or module 182, an<br>
engine load module 184, an engine runtime indicator 186, an engine speed<br>
sensor 188. The cylinder air evaluation module 180 determines status of air<br>
within cylinders of an engine. The status may include, for example, flow rate and<br>
cylinder air mass. The cylinder air evaluation module 180 determines the status<br>
based on air-related signals generated by the air sensors 158 and engine output<br>
torque. The engine output torque may be directly or indirectly measured or<br>
estimated. The engine output torque may be directly measure via one or more<br>
sensors, such as a drive shaft torque sensor, a strain gauge, or other torque<br>
sensor. The engine output torque may be indirectly estimated based on engine<br>
operating parameters some of which are disclosed herein, for example, using a<br>
look-up table. The engine speed sensor 188, such as a camshaft, crankshaft,<br>
flywheel or transmission sensor, generates speed signal that is indicative of<br>
engine speed RPM. The vehicle control module 152 can determine engine<br>
speed from the speed signal. Note that the engine speed may also be indirectly<br>
estimated based on engine operating parameters.<br>
 <br>
[0040] The air sensors 158 include an air flow sensor 190, a throttle<br>
position sensor 192, an intake air pressure sensor 194, and may include other<br>
air-related sensors. An air flow sensor 190 may be a mass air flow (MAF) sensor<br>
that monitors the air flow rate through a throttle. The throttle position sensor 192<br>
is responsive to a position of a throttle plate and generates a throttle position<br>
signal TPS. The intake air pressure sensor 194 generates a manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) signal.<br>
[0041] The pressure sensor 160 may be responsive to atmospheric<br>
pressure and may generate a barometric pressure BARO signal.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIG. 3, a perspective view of another fuel<br>
volatility compensation system 200 is shown. The fuel volatility compensation<br>
system 200 may include or be part of a vehicle control module, such as one of<br>
the vehicle control modules 80 and 152. The fuel volatility compensation system<br>
200 includes modification modules 202 and a combiner 204, which may be part<br>
of a single control module or may include separate stand-alone modules as<br>
shown.<br>
[0043] The modification modules 202 may include look-up tables<br>
and/or fuzzy logic rules. Each table may include data that is predetermined,<br>
measured, and stored in the modification modules 202 or corresponding<br>
memory. The fuzzy logic rules allow for non-linear compensation and control<br>
with the use of a reduced amount of memory. When tables are used, the<br>
modification modules 202 look-up the associated inputs and provide modification<br>
signals that are combined by the combiner 204. When fuzzy logic is used, the<br>
 <br>
modification modules 202 apply the associated inputs to a predetermined set of<br>
rules and generate modification signals that are outputted to the combiner 204.<br>
A combination of tabular look-up and fuzzy logic may be used. The fuzzy logic<br>
may include if-then statements that result in a combined output result, which is<br>
interpreted by the vehicle control module 152 to adjust an air/fuel ratio to be<br>
leaner or richer. This adjustment may be used to adjust an idle speed of the<br>
engine during a cold start.<br>
[0044] A cold start refers to the cranking and initial ignition and running<br>
of an engine when the coolant temperature of the engine minus ambient<br>
temperature is less than a threshold, such as for example 12° C. This cold start<br>
may occur when the engine coolant temperature is higher than ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
[0045] The modification modules 202 include an engine speed and<br>
runtime module 206, a load and engine runtime module 208, a temperature<br>
module 210 and a pressure module 212. The engine speed and runtime module<br>
206 receives the engine speed signal RPM and a load signal LOAD. The load<br>
signal may be generated based on the air flow signal, the throttle position signal,<br>
the engine output torque signal, a cylinder air status signal, and/or other load<br>
related signal. The load and engine runtime module 208 receives the load signal<br>
and the engine runtime signal. The temperature module 210 receives the intake<br>
air temperature signal, the engine coolant temperature signal and/or other engine<br>
temperature signals. The pressure module 212 receives the pressure signal<br>
BARO.<br>

[0046] The engine speed and runtime module 206 generates a speed<br>
modification signal. The load and engine runtime module 208 generates a load<br>
modification signal. The temperature module 210 generates a temperature<br>
modification signal. The pressure module 212 generates a pressure modification<br>
signal. The stated modification signals may be referred to as error signals.<br>
[0047] The modification signals may be provided to the combiner 204<br>
to generate an air/fuel ratio adjustment signal, an idle speed adjustment signal,<br>
and/or a fuel volatility adjustment signal. As an example, the combiner 204 may<br>
include a summer or multiplier for summing and/or multiplying the modification<br>
signals.<br>
[0048] Referring now to FIG. 4, a logic flow diagram illustrating a<br>
method of operating an internal combustion engine incorporating fuel volatility<br>
compensation is shown. Although the following steps are primarily described<br>
with respect to the embodiments of FIGs. 2-3, the steps may be applied to other<br>
embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
[0049] In step 220, devices generate parameter signals, which are<br>
indicative of a current state of fuel volatility. The devices may include any of the<br>
above described sensors, modules and indicators. The parameter signals may<br>
include any of the signals generated by the above sensors, modules, and<br>
indicators. An example embodiment is described below with respect to steps<br>
220A-F.<br>
[0050] In step 220A, an engine speed sensor or module generates an<br>
engine speed signal. In step 220B, an engine load module generates an engine<br>
 <br>
load signal. In step 220C, an engine runtime indicator generates an engine<br>
runtime signal. An engine runtime signal may be approximately equal to a length<br>
of time between a current engine operating time and an engine startup time. The<br>
engine startup time may be associated with an initial ignition of the engine, an<br>
initial cranking of the engine, a turn key event and/or a predetermined time.<br>
[0051] In step 220D, an intake air temperature signal is generated. In<br>
step 220E, an engine coolant temperature signal is generated. In step 220F, a<br>
pressure signal is generated, such as the barometric pressure signal BARO.<br>
The barometric pressure may be sensed or estimated based on manifold<br>
absolute pressure, which may be sensed during engine startup. Steps 220A-F<br>
may be performed during the same time period, simultaneously, sequentially, or<br>
in a predetermined order.<br>
[0052] In step 222, the modification modules generate modification<br>
signals based on the parameter signals. The modification signals may include<br>
error information. Steps 222A-222D are shown as part of one example<br>
embodiment. Step 222A, includes the generation of a speed and runtime<br>
modification signal based on the engine speed signal and engine load signal.<br>
The engine speed or idle speed may be compared with a predetermined idle<br>
speed for a given engine runtime. Cold start engine speed varies depending on<br>
fuel volatility and engine runtime. A fuzzy logic table may be used to<br>
compensate for the variations in fuel volatility by contributing to the speed and<br>
runtime modification signal. This fuzzy logic table may be based on known<br>
speed and runtime values of various fuel volatilities. As an example, when<br>
 <br>
engine speed is too high or too low, control reduces or adds fuel in step 226 to<br>
compensate for the current state of fuel volatility.<br>
[0053] Step 222B, includes the generation of a load modification signal<br>
based on the engine load signal and the engine runtime signal. The load<br>
modification signal may be based on cylinder air or the air consumed by each<br>
cylinder per cycle. A current engine load may be compared with a predetermined<br>
engine load for a given engine runtime. The fuzzy logic table associated with<br>
step 222B may be based on known load and runtime values of various fuel<br>
volatilities.<br>
[0054] Step 222C, includes the generation of a temperature<br>
modification signal based on the intake air temperature signal and the engine<br>
coolant temperature signal. The fuzzy logic table associated with step 222C may<br>
be based on known temperature values of various fuel volatilities.<br>
[0055] Step 222D, includes the generation of a pressure modification<br>
signal based on the barometric pressure signal. The fuzzy logic table associated<br>
with step 222D may be based on known pressure values of various fuel<br>
volatilities. The associated pressure table for the pressure module may provide a<br>
correction factor based on pressure values that affect cold start combustion<br>
characteristics. As an example, when the pressure is low, the fuel volatility may<br>
be high, thus the correction factor may be generated accordingly.<br>
[0056] The modification signals may be generated via the speed and<br>
runtime module, the load module, the temperature module, and the pressure<br>
module. The modules may store and/or look-up values in associated tables,<br>
 <br>
models, and/or use fuzzy logic to generate the modification signals. When tables<br>
are used, the values stored in the tables may include predetermined values<br>
determined during engine testing. Fuzzy logic rules and membership functions<br>
may be used to approximate continuous functions. The number of rules may<br>
vary per application. The fuzzy logic includes arithmetic interpolation for non-<br>
linear functions. If-then statements may be used in implementation of the fuzzy<br>
logic rules.<br>
[0057] In step 224, a combiner generates an air/fuel ratio adjustment<br>
signal based on the modification signals. The modification signals are combined<br>
to generate the air/fuel ratio adjustment signal, which is used to maintain the<br>
engine running around stoicmetric with minimum emissions output. The<br>
combiner may include a summer, a multiplier, and/or other logic devices. The<br>
air/fuel ratio adjustment signal may be referred to as a fuel volatility adjustment<br>
signal. By adjusting the air/fuel ratio changes in fuel volatility is compensated.<br>
[0058] In step 226, a control module compensates for a current fuel<br>
volatility by adjusting a current air/fuel mixture of an engine based on the air/fuel<br>
ratio adjustment signal to provide an idle speed. The control module provides a<br>
richer or leaner fuel based on the air/fuel ration adjustment signal. As the fuel<br>
volatility changes due to, for example, change in fuel, air/fuel ratios,<br>
temperatures, operating conditions, pressures, etc., the control module adjusts<br>
for these changes to provide a smooth and accurate idle speed. The idle speed<br>
may be provided during a cold start or during other operating temperatures. The<br>
idle speed may be adjusted based on engine coolant temperature and engine run<br>
 <br>
time or other engine and exhaust system parameters. Measured or actual<br>
engine speed is controlled to smoothly and accurately follow a selected or<br>
predetermined speed.<br>
[0059] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different<br>
order depending upon the application.<br>
[0060] The embodiments disclosed herein dynamically control cold<br>
start engine idle speed when fuel of various volatility values is used. Fuzzy logic<br>
may be used by control algorithms to control engine idle speed and emissions<br>
output by analyzing various engine conditions and ambient temperature<br>
conditions. The effects of altitude, load and wide temperature variations are<br>
monitored. The embodiments provide cold start idle quality and emissions<br>
control. Precise control of engine operating speed is based on fuel volatility and<br>
engine and ambient temperature conditions.<br>

in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
