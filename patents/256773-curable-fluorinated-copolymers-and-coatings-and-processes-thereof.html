				<td>CURABLE FLUORINATED COPOLYMERS AND COATINGS AND PROCESSES THEREOF<br>
This invention relates to a process for coating of various substrates by applying fluorinated copolymers thereto, some fluorinated copolymers as such and its preparation, coating composition and the coated substrates.<br>
Coating of rigid substrates with fluorinated copolymers is already known.<br>
US-A-5548019 describes a composition for an aqueous coating material comprising a poly-socyanate compound and a fluorine-containing copolymer having hydroxyl groups for rigid substrates like concrete.<br>
The WO-A-2004/072197 (priority JP 035583 , JP 407700 ) discloses fluorine-containing aqueous coating composition, comprising A) a functional group containing fluororesin aqueous emulsion obtained by dispersing in water a fluoroolefm copolymer having functional groups obtained by a solution polymerization process and B) a water-dispersible unblocked isocyanate compound for the coating of rigid substrates.<br>
Also coatings of flexible substrates are known but using the coating agent in a non-aqueous form.<br>
In the WO 2004/059014 (JP 2004-203921; priority JP 2002-371567) and JP-2000-054000 (EP-1123981) fluoropolymer based coating compositions for leather, a coating method and the coated leather are disclosed.<br>
EP-A-1338637 discloses aqueous dispersions of fluorinated copolymers as coating compositions that necessarily contain a set of emulsifiers and surfactants in order to stabilize the dispersions.<br>
Additionally fluorinated copolymers as coating agents are disclosed in US-A-4487893, EP-A-848023, JP-4-239072, JP-05-117578, JP-05-179191, JP-02-289639, JP-03-047853 (DE-A-4010881), WO 2001/019883, EP-A-841405, DE-A-4201603, JP-05-247306, JP-2004/238621, DE-4416415 (EP-682044), JP-2004/203946, EP-1238004 JP-02-300389 and US-A-4487893.<br>
The requirements to anti-soiling properties and mechanical stability of coatings to scratch resistance, flexural strength, inter-layer adhesion and fastness properties have been steadily increasing in recent years.<br>
Furthermore, ecological restrictions have forced many industrial branches to enhance their attempts for creating a safer and cleaner handling of coating systems that provide the highest possible benefit to the customer. Therefore, the demand for solventless or solvent-free systems is still increasing.<br>
For practical reasons any solvent-content that may be present in a formulation can be determined according to the guidelines for VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds). VOC means any organic compound having an initial boiling point less than or equal to 250°C measured at a standard pressure of 101,3 kPa (as used in Directive 2004/42/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes). The VOC content of a product in it's ready-to-use state is determined as specified in the directive being either ISO 11890-2 or ASTM D 2369. The. VOC content is calculated from analytical measurements in grams/liter, whereby the density of the product is measured with the appropriate density determination method (ISO 2811).<br>
Many patents disclosed in the literature have contributed to technical improvements and quite acceptable solutions. Already existing solutions proposed in the patent literature have the disadvantage that the coatings irrespective of the curing reaction involved to reduce some hydrophilic functionality contain a large proportion of residual hydrophilic groups that contribute to insufficient chemical resistance and soil repellency.<br>
However, there is still a demand for aqueous coating and finishing systems that are capable to meet high performance requirements not only with respect to water-,oil and dirt-repellency, but also to impart high mechanical durability, e.g. flexural strength, tear strength, compressive strength, notched impact resistance, high flexibility on exposure to dry, wet and cold flexes or bending or shear forces, heat- and TJV-resistance, abrasion-resistance and water- and humidity-resistance.<br>
The mechanical requirements to a coating system can be fulfilled by applying a finish or top-coat consisting of polyurethane-dispersions or high-performance polyacrylate dispersions. Anti-staining properties on its own can be imparted to a substrate by application of a fluorine-containing copolymer dispersions. These coating compositions known from the prior art have still deficiencies or disadvantages that must be avoided or at least need improvements.<br>
It is known, that fluorine-containing polymers may cause inter-layer adhesion problems or may deteriorate other properties e.g. mechanical strength, optical properties or provide a dry and unpleasant feeling on touching a surface.<br>
As an example, to provide leather for car interior, especially car seats, it is desirable to provide leather that is resistant to staining by dyestuff-transfer or migration from garment worn by the end-user or can be protected from soil like dust, oil, printing inks or toner from newspapers / magazines, inks from pens or permanent marker, tobacco ash, common food, sauces, spices and beverages, sun-tans, cosmetic compositions and so on or at least is customer-friendly by imparting<br>
easy-to-clean properties and cleanability so that substantially no residue of soil or dirt will be detectable nor any damage of the finish.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a solution, that will overcome the drawbacks of known fluorinated polymer compositions. Furthermore it is the purpose of the invention to provide fluorinated polymer compositions for coating and finishing applications that meet the requirements described above. For example, it is an objective of the invention to provide room-temperature curable coating compositions that are applicable to flexible substrates, particularly that are heat-sensitive materials such as leather.<br>
With regard to the present invention the term "dirt" means any contamination of the surface in question preferably by visible components altering optical aspect, hand and/or physical properties of the original surface e.g. various colors from pens, from permanent (solvent-based) or removable (water-soluble) marker, different colored crayons, cosmetics such as lipstick, sun-tans and the like, ketchup, mustard, oil, tobacco ash, dust and transfer of dyes being insufficiently fixed to garment like jeans on rubbing or pressing against the surface in question.<br>

The curable fluorinated copolymer FC used as feactant in the present invention contain hydroxyl groups and optionally carboxyl groups and optionally other hydrophilic groups. In a preferred embodiment the curable fluorinated copolymer FC is soluble in organic solvents, particularly esters, ketones and aromatic solvents. Examples for suitable solvents are xylene, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like.<br>
Other hydrophilic groups that may be present in the fluorinated copolymer FC are for example, polyether residues, that are introduced by copolymerization using the corresponding comonomers mentioned under FC2) and FC3).<br>
The concentration of hydroxyl groups and optional carboxyl groups present in the fluorinated copolymer FC can be determined by titration according to known methods and are given as hydroxyl numbers and acid numbers, respectively, in mg KOH/g.<br>
The curable fluorinated copolymer A of the present invention preferably contains hydroxyl groups and optionally carboxyl groups and optionally other hydrophilic groups.<br>
Other hydrophilic groups that may be present in the fluorinated copolymer A are for example, polyether residues, that are introduced by copolymerization using the corresponding comonomers mentioned under FC2) and FC3) or by a subsequent reaction with the corresponding reactants containing such residues as described above under M2).<br>
The concentration of hydroxyl groups and/or carboXylgroups present in the fluorinated copolymer A can be determined by titration according to known methods and are given as hydroxyl numbers and acid numbers, respectively, in mg KOH/g.<br>
Preferred curable fluorinated copolymers A have a hydroxyl number in the range from 10 to 300 mg KOH /g. Lower amounts of hydroxyl groups can give polymers with too low crosslink density, thus giving coating layers that will have inferior mechanical resistance. Higher amount of hydroxyl groups can lead to polar polymers causing enhanced hydropnilicity and better adhesion of polar dirt, thus giving coating layers that will have inferior antisoiling resistance and swelling characteristics.<br>
Preferred curable fluorinated copolymers A have a carboxyl number in the range from 5 to 150 mg KOH /g. Lower amounts of carboxyl groups can give polymers with a lack in dispersion stability and having a large particle size distribution, thus giving coating layers that will have inferior mechanical resistance and film-forming properties. Higher amount of carboxyl groups can give<br>
polymers with very hydrophilic properties, thus giving coating layers that can have inferior water resistance and antisoiling properties and may keep this undesirable permanent hydrophilicity if not increasing the amount of crosslinkers.<br>
Preferred curable fluorinated copolymers A are further characterized by a fluorine content of 5-60 % F, preferably 10-50 % F, most preferably 20-40 % F, each calculated from the parts by weight fluorine (F) related to 100 parts of copolymer solids.<br>
Preferred curable fluorinated copolymers A have a molecular weight measured as number average molecular weight Mn in the range from 5000 to 100000, preferably from 7000 to 50000, mostly preferably from 10000 to 30000 g/mol. The Mn is measured by separation of the polymer by gel chromatography and calculation the molecular weight against a kit of polymer standards having a known narrow molecular weight distribution.<br>
Flexible substrates are for example non-woven, woven-fabrics, textiles, garment, paper, natural leather, genuine leather either coated or non-coated, split leather, patent leather, artificial leather, plastic sheet and elastomer, with genuine leather either coated or non-coated, natural leather, split leather, paper and textiles being preferred.<br>
Particularly, preferred leather substrates are finished and unfinished leathers.<br>
Rigid substrates may be a metal surface such as iron, stainless steel, brass, aluminum, other alloys, mineral surfaces such as concrete, ceramics, glass, silica or an organic surface from natural source like wood or man-made materials such as polymers, preferably thermoplastic materials, crosslinked materials such as composites, fibre reinforced plastics, sealants, rubberelastic materials such as sealants, elasthane-fibres, woven and non-woven fabrics, glass fibers, metaplastic combination materials such as electric circuit, printed circuit and electric parts, and the like.<br>
Preferably, this invention relates to compositions for finishing or coating textiles, artificial leather, paper, proteinaceous surfaces like genuine, natural learner, split leather.<br>
It is preferred to use the copolymer A as an aqueous dispersion. In particular its content of volatile organic compounds according to ISO 11890-2 is lower than 1,0 %, preferably lower than 0,5%.<br>
The copolymer A may be used as such or in combination with crosslinkers B and other components but organic solvents.<br>
As crosslinker B one or more crosslinker based on<br>
Bl) a blocked or unblocked water-dispersible polyisocyanate including mixtures of hydrophilic polyisocyanates with hydrophobic polyisocyanates with the proviso that the mixture is water-dispersible and/or<br>
B2) a polycarbodiimide and/or<br>
B3) other crosslinkers different from B1) and B2)<br>
is preferred.<br>
The crosslinkers preferably used in the present invention are blocked or unblocked water-dispersible polyisocyanates Bl), polycarbodiimides B2) or mixtures thereof. Furthermore, optionally other crosslinkers that contain crosslinking functionalities being different from isocyanate and/or carbodiimide are advantageously used with respect to the invention.<br>
Bl)<br>
Although blocked polyisocyanates can advantageously be used according to this invention, it is however recommended to use unblocked polyisocyanates as crosslinkers.<br>
Blocked water-dispersible polyisocyanates Bl) are polyisocyanates that do not have any free isocyanate groups but functional groups derived therefrom that are capable of reacting with compounds having NCO-reactive groups, wherein the bond between the blocking group and the polyisocyanate residue will be scissioned on heating or on contact with the other components of the composition bearing such NCO-reactive groups. The leaving group of the blocking can be split off and will diffuse through the coating layer and leave the coating. On the other hand it is possible and more desirable, that the leaving group will be incorporated and fixed in the coating layer by a chemical reaction with the fluorinated polymer composition on drying.<br>
Preferred blocking groups are isopropylamine, methyl benzylamine, tert butyl benzyl amine, amino-triazol, 2-aminocaprolactam, caprolactam, acetyl acetone, hydroxylamine, butanone oxime, sodium bisulfite and the like. Preferred blocking groups are isopropylamine, methyl benzylamine, tert butyl benzyl amine, amino-triazol, acetyl acetone, sodium bisulfite.<br>
Unblocked water-dispersible polyisocyanates Bl) are polyisocyanates to be mechanically dispersed in an aqueous solution by applying shear forces or are self-emulsifiable polyisocyanates. Self-emulsifying means that said polyisocyanates are modified by hydrophilic groups in such a way that the polyisocyanate will dissolve in water or, vice versa, is readily dilutable on addition of water or any aqueous system. Polyisocyanates that are more hydrophobic need application of shear forces (static mixers, high speed stirring, high pressure homogenizers, rotor stator mixers, high<br>
pressure nozzle techniques). Additionally, but not preferred, they may contain external emulsifiers of nonionic, anionic or cationic type, whereas the nonionic and anionic types are preferred with respect to compatibility with the components of the composition.<br>
The polyisocyanates to be mechanically dispersed in water are for example tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, cyclohexylene diisocyanate, bis(isocyanatocyclohexyl)methane, diisocyanatononane, xylylene diisocyanate, toluylene diisocyanate, pure or crude diphenylmethane diisocyanate, urethane and/or allophanate groups containing reaction products of the above-mentioned polyisocyanates with polyols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isobutanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaeryhrit, sorbitol and their alkoxylation products with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide.<br>
Preferred unblocked water-dispersible polyisocyanates are aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates having a NCO-functionality of at least 2, preferably 2 to 6, more preferably 2.3 to 4.<br>
Preferred water-dispersible polyisocyanate crosshnkers are biurets, allophanates, uretdiones or isocyanurate groups containing trimerisates of hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate that are modified by polyethers or by polyethers and ionic groups.<br>
Preferred water-dispersible polyisocyanate crosshnkers are also mixtures of hydrophilic polyisocyanates with hydrophobic polyisocyanates with the proviso that the mixture remains water-dispersible. Hydrophobic polyisocyanates are for instance those polyisocyanates mentioned above and being suitable as reactants for synthesis of hydrophilic polyisocyanates.<br>
Especially preferred are nonionic polyisocyanates that are modified by polyethers. As such are mentioned mixtures of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates having monoalkoxy polyether substituents said polyethers being composed of 10 or less ethylene oxide units on average. Such polyisocyanates are for example described in the EP-A 540 985.<br>
In addition to these nonionically hydrophilized, polyetherurethane groups containing polyisocyanates, preferred crosslinkers are also polyether modified water-dispersible polyisocyanates that contain additional ionic groups, e.g. sulfonate (e.g. EP-A 703 255) or carboxylic groups or amino- or ammonium groups (e.g. EP-A 582 166) in order to impart an improved emulsification or to obtain special effects.<br>
As useful polyisocyanates are mentioned, for example,<br>
reaction product obtained from 80 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 20 parts of an ethoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 350 g/mol;<br>
reaction product obtained from 90 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 10 parts of a methoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 70 to 750 g/mol;<br>
reaction product obtained from 85 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 15 parts of a butoxy terminated EO/PO-segmented polyether with a ratio EO/PO = 7:3 and having a number average molecular weight of 2250 g/mol;<br>
reaction product obtained from 83 parts of a HDI-biuret and 17 parts of a methoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 650 g/mol;<br>
reaction product obtained from 87 parts of a IPDI-trimerisate and 13 parts of a 2:1 mixture of methoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 350 and 750 g/mol, respectively;<br>
reaction product obtained from 80 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 3 parts triethylene glcol and 17 parts of a ethoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 550 g/mol;<br>
reaction product obtained from 87 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 0,2 parts of n,N-dimethyI ethanolamine and 16.9 parts of a methoxy terminated EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 350 g/mol, being afterwards reacted with dibutyl phosphate to protonize the tertiary amino group;<br>
reaction product obtained from 85 parts of a HDI-trimerisate and 5 parts of a the sodium salt of ethoxylated l,4-butanediol-2-sulfonic acid (number average molecular weight of 368 g/mol) an 10 parts of an ethoxy terminate EO-polyether having a number average molecular weight of 370 g/mol.<br>
The proportion of the polyisocyanate crosslinkers to be added to the composition is not particurlarly restricted, but preferably within a range of from 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 4, more preferably 1,2 to 3 NCO-equivalents in terms of a ratio of NCO-equivalents to the OH-equivalents (molar ratio) provided by copolymer A).<br>
Lower NCO/OH ratios are undesirable because the crosslinking is not sufficient to provide coating systems having the intended properties. For example, the mechnaical resistance of the surface against scratches or abrasion may suffer from a softer coating layer.<br>
Higher NCO/OH ratios are undesirable because too much free NCO-groups remaining after the reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the composition will react with water and may produce bubbles in the coating layer. Such voids will play the role of initiation points at which any cracks will start<br>
and propagate with high velocity on application of bending or tear forces until the complete coating will crack or will be split off.<br>

The solvent Z used as diluent for the derivatization process must have a certain solubility in water and must dissolve in the solution of the acylated copolymer. Thus, it is selected from the group of lower alcohols, carboxylic acid derivatives like esters, lactams, ketones. Preferred solvents are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethylacetate, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, N-methylpyrolidone, pyrrolidone. Most preferred solvents are acetone, ethanol, isopropanol.<br>
The polycarboxylic anhydride that is used for the partial or complete conversion of the hydroxyl groups being present in the curable fluorinated copolymer FC are for example succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, norbornane dicarboxylic anhydride, norbornene dicarboxylic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, dihydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, trimellitic anhydride, alkenyl succinic anhydride. Preferred anhydrides are succinic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride. It is also possible to use mixtures of polycarboxylic anhydride in order to adjust the concentration of the carboxylic groups and to achieve optimum dispersibility in water and in view of the storage stability of the resulting copolymer dispersion.<br>
The base that is used for neutralisation of the carboxylic groups of the curable fluorinated copolymer are for example lithium, sodium, potassium hydroxide or carbonate, ammonia or amines such as diethyl amine, trimethyl amine, triethyl amine, tripropyl amine, hydroxyethyl<br>
amine, bis(hydroxyethyl) amine, dimethyl hydroxyethyl amine, bis(hydroxyethyl) methyl amine, tris(hydroxyethyl) amine, diethyl hydroxyethyl amine, bis(hydroxyethyl) ethyl amine, hydroxy propyl amine, bis(hydroxyproyl) amine, dimethyl hydroxypropyl amine, bis(hydroxypropyl) methyl amine, tris(hydroxypropyl) amine, diethyl hydroxypropyl amine, bis(hydroxypropyl) ethyl amine, methyl morpholine, hydroxyethyl piperazine. The term „propyl" includes-also the corresponding isopropyl residues. Preferred bases are ammonia, triethylamine and bis(hydroxy.ethyl) methylamine.<br>
In addition the present invention refers to a curable fluorinated copolymer A2 which is the reaction product of FC and<br>
Ml) at least trimellitic anhydride and optionally other polycarboxylic anhydrides and optionally<br>
M2) at least a monofunctional isocyanate,<br>
wherein FC is a curable fluorinated copolymer on the basis of<br>
FC1) at least one fluorinated olefin having 2 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
FC2) at least one non-fluorinated olefin having OH-groups and optionally carboxyl groups and<br>
FC3) at least one non-fluorinated, hydroxyl group free olefin having optionally carboxyl groups.<br>
The present invention refers also to a process for preparation of such a copolymer A2 comprising the steps:<br>
1)	reaction of a polymer solution comprising of solvent X and polymer FC, with trimellitic anhydride and optionally one or more polycarboxylic anhydrides, and optionally at least one monofunctional isocyanate, optionally in the presence of a solvent Y<br>
2)	neutralization of optional carboxylic groups by a base,<br>
3)	dispersion in water and<br>
4)	removal of the solvent preferably by distillation.<br>
If a monofunctional isocyanate is involved in step 1), it is preferred firstly to react FC with the monoisocyanate and subsequently with trimellitic anhydride and optionally one or more polycarboxylic anhydride. However, it is also possible to use a mixture of monofunctional isocyanate and trimellitic anhydride and optionally one or more polycarboxylic anhydride. It is<br>
also possible, to react FC with trimellitic anhydride and optionally one or more polycarboxylic anhydride in a first reaction and then with a monofunctional isocyanate.<br>
A further subject of the invention is a coating composition containing<br>
-	at least one curable fluorinated copolymer Al or A2 and<br>
-	at least one polyisocyanate crosslinker having at least 2 NCO units.<br>
Preferably this composition is an aqueous dispersion.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a curable fluorinated copolymer A which is the reaction product of FC and.<br>
Ml) at least one polycarboxylic anhydride and/or<br>
M2) at least a monofunctional isocyanate,<br>
wherein FC is a curable fluorinated copolymer on the basis of<br>
FC1) at least one fluorinated olefin having 2 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
FC2) at least one non-fluorinated olefin having OH-groups and optionally carboxyl groups and<br>
FC3) at least one non-fluorinated, hydroxyl group free olefin having optionally carboxyl groups in particular as aqueous dispersion as coating agent for flexible substrates.<br>
The invention also refers to a process for coating rigid substrates applying a curable fluorinated copolymer Al, A2 or a mixture thereof coating composition containing these copolymers respectively onto the substrate.<br>
A further subject of the present invention is the substrate obtained by the coating process of the present invention in particular the substrate coated with the copolymer Al or A2 or a coating composition containing these copolymers, respectively.<br>
The aqueous coating compositions according to the present invention are used as coatings for various substrates. For example, they can be used as protective coatings, more particularly as anti-graffiti coatings, anti-soil coatings or easy-to-clean topcoats on rigid or flexible substrates.<br>
Suitable flexible and rigid substrates are mentioned above.<br>
The curable fluorinated copolymer Al and A2 are used particularly for coating flexible or rigid, in particular flexible substrates.<br>
Preferably, the coating compositions of this invention are advantageously used as a sole topcoat for finishing of textiles, artificial leather, paper, proteinaceous surfaces like genuine, natural leather, split leather. Most preferably, the compositions are used as components in topcoat formulations for coating of flexible substrates, preferably leather, textiles and paper.<br>
The coating compositions are applied by spraying, brush-coating, curtain-coating, roller, dipping, roll-coating, flow-coating, spin-coating and any other coating technique generally used in the industry such as electro-deposition with the amounts already mentioned above .<br>
The coating composition of the present invention is a room temperature curable system. In many cases of industrial applications it is preferred, however, to enhance the reaction velocity by increasing the temperature and to allow a faster drying process. Furthermore, it is possible to add catalysts to accelerate the crosslinking reaction.<br>
To make use of the optimum performance of the present coating composition it is necessary to ensure a thorough drying of the coating directly after application, preferably in a ventilated drying channel, in order to remove the water from the coating layer and to ensure a proper film-forming process. It is further recommended to handle the coated substrate with care until the crosslinking reaction is completed. The time needed for a complete reaction depends on the curing conditions, e.g. velocity of the belt or the temperature in the drying channel or drying cabinet, the presence of catalysts or the duration of any heat exposure.<br>
The coating composition containing the crosslinkers provides heavy-duty coatings, which are weather-resistant, have excellent anti-soiling properties and mechanical durability. In particular, soiling with solvent-based marker (e.g. xylene-based or non-xylene type) or pen or other inks of various colors that are used in the market, can be easily removed from the surface of the coated substrate by wiping the surface with a mild detergent in water or a cleaner without applying abrasive materials or solvents. The coatings are also resistant against other kinds of dirt as mentioned above. Automotive upholstery leather or leather used for other car interior, for example, is made resistant against soiling by any cosmetics. Furthermore, the coating of the present invention provides a protection for leather against intense colors from incidental spills of food and beverages. After cleaning, the surface will not be damaged or alter its optical appearance in view of gloss or color shade or any other property compared to the appearance of the substrate before contamination with the dirt.<br>

Cleanabilitv<br>
A black oil ink pen (ball-point pen manufactured by Mitsubishi pencil Co.,Ltd.) and a black permanent solvent-based textmarker (ARTLME® manufactured by Shachihata Inc.) were applied to the surface and left for 3 minutes at ambient temperature to let any solvent evaporate. For removal of any traces originating from applied by ball-point pen a mild detergent solution was applied to a cloth which was then used to wipe off as much as possible of the pen-line. Textmarker spot were treated similarly, but in this case a cloth to which a little pea-like amount of a leather cleaner cream had been applied was rubbed over the marker trace to remove as much as possible. A second piece of cloth prepared with fresh cleaner was rubbed by circular movement and mild compression over the trace. The cleaning effect was evaluated visually against the untreated original by numbers from 5 (no visible traces, completely removed without change of surface appearance or damage of the finish) to 1 (traces remained).<br>
Other tests<br>
Martindale test: This test is very common for testing abrasion and pilling in the textile field, but it is also recommended by producers of automotive leather as well as car manufacturers for evaluation of antisoiling properties of leather, especially for car seats, although many specific embodiments of test conditions and subsequent evaluation exist.<br>
Leather samples treated with a fluorinated composition of the present invention were cut off with a diameter of 150 mm and were placed into the fixed sample holder of a Martindale testing machine according to manufacturer's instructions.<br>
A piece of blue jeans cloth was exactly positioned in the opposite holder representing the moving part of the machine. Before mounting the jeans cloth it was wetted with a synthetic alkaline perspiration solution. Then the machine was closed and started. During the following cycles of treatment the jeans cloth was rubbed against the leather surface under a constant load by circular movements wherein the symmetry of the movements is described by a Lissajous-pattern and the load is determined by the machine's construction and the steel weight put on top of each movable holder. Up to 6 samples can be tested simultaneously. After application of 1000 cycles the leather specimen was removed and evaluated for any alteration of the surface.<br>
On a specimen with very good performance no blue traces can .be seen at all or the deeply blue coloured perspiration liquid will spread over the specimen (beads up, no wetting) or it can be<br>
wiped off with a mild detergent solution without any visual changes of the surface compared to the untreated original surface. Such a specimen will be evaluated by 5 (= excellent).<br>
On the contrary, a specimen showing bad performance an intense blue-coloured square will be visible on its surface. Such a specimen will be evaluated by 0 (very bad).<br>
All leather specimen were evaluated this way and given a number in the range between 0 and 5<br>
Evaluation of mechanical performance of leather specimenDry flexes were measured by means of a Bally flexometer according to a standard operation procedure commonly used in the leather industry. Dry leather pieces were evaluated visually for any damage after applying 100000 sharp edged flexes. Visual changes of the specimen are also evaluated (O = no change, O-X = minor change, X = easily detectable change, X-XX = remarkable change, XX = extraordinarily strong change.<br>
Wet flexes were measured by means of a Bally flexometer according to a standard operation procedure commonly used in the leather industry. Wet leather pieces were evaluated visually for any damage after applying 20000 sharp edged flexes. Visual changes of the specimen are also evaluated (O = no change, O-X = minor change, X = easily detectable change, X-XX = remarkable change, XX = extraordinarily strong change.<br>

Preparation of the leather specimens:<br>
For all trials leather specimens were used, prepared as follows:<br>
On standard automotive crust leather there was applied a binder / colour mix via roll coater in such a way, that material is applied in an amount of about 13 g (wet) per square foot). The mixture used in all cases had composition as follows:.<br>
160 parts of an aqueous white pigment formulation, containing about 56% Titanium dioxide and 4% acrylic binder<br>
20 parts of an aqueous caramel pigment formulation, containing about 46 Ferrous oxide and 5% acrylic binder 4 parts of an aqueous brown pigment formulation, containing about 44% Ferrous oxide and 5% acrylic binder<br>
2 parts of an aqueous carbon black formulation, containing about 12% carbon black and 5% acrylic binder<br>
160 parts of an aqueous softening and feel improving formulation, having 25% solids content and consisting predominantly of casein, claw oil, lanolin and silica in a ratio of 1:2:0,5:1<br>
70 parts of an aqueous silica dulling formulation, having solids content of about 23% and characterized in that the formulation contains no binder but only a very low amount of acrylic thickener, to prevent the silica from precipitation.<br>
150 parts of an aqueous aliphatic polyester polyurethane, having solids content of about 35% and NMP content of about 5%, with modulus at 100% elongation of 2,5Mpa; tensile strength of 20 MPa and elongation at break of 600%; characterized in very good adhesion and embossing performance.<br>
100 parts of an aqueous aliphatic polycarbonate polyurethane, having solids content of about 40% and characterized in having modulus at 100% elongation of 4 MPa; tensile strength of 20 MPa and elongation at break of 600%<br>
200 parts of an acrylic binder having solids content of 35%, containing a very small amount (
70 parts of water.<br>
Additionally there were used 10 parts of a feel improver (silicone emulsion having 60% solids content) and 5 parts of an associative PUR thickener having 20% PUR content..<br>
After application of this mix, the leathers prepared werde dried at 70-80°C for about 10 minutes and stored for one day at ambient temperature. Subsequently the leathers were ironed at 90°C using an ironing pressure of 50 bar and a roller speed of 6 m/sec.<br>
Finally, the leathers were dry drummed for 4 hours. After this, the leathers are ready for application of the antisoil topcoat.<br>
The antisoil topcoat was applied and dried as described below, composition of the different formulations as well as test results are given in table 1.<br>
The viscosity of these formulations is about 20-30 seconds measured by using a Ford-cup equipped with an outlet of 4 mm diameter.<br>
This formulation was applied to the surface by means of an airless spray-gun. After spraying 2 crosses with an intermediate drying step the finished leather was left for a few minutes in a hood to remove some water and to initiate the film-forming process and was then placed in a preconditioned drying chamber where it was kept for 2 minutes at 80°C. Then the sample was removed from the drying chamber and horsed up for cooling to ambient temperature.<br>
After conditioning at standard temperature at 293°K / air humidity of 60% for 2 days the sample was evaluated for anti-soiling performance and fastness properties.<br>
Test method (soiling the leather surface with a permanent marker and subsequent cleaning with a commercially available leather cleaning cream) is described above; test results are judeged as follows:<br>
Cleaning result: ranging from l(worst; no removal of the soiling) to 5 (best; complete removal of the soiling without any negative effect on the surface to be cleaned, e.g. alterations in gloss<br>
Result of flexings: ranging from 0 (best result, no damage) to xx (worst result, conplete damage of the finish<br>
Result of rubfastness : ranging from 0 (best result, no observable damage of the finish) to (severe damage of the finish)<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
*100 000 flexes; ** 20 000 flexes; *** associative thickener as described; diluted in the equal amount of water<br>
Rubfastness: all specimens perform extraordinary well; they do not exhibit any damage after 1000 rubs.<br>
Comparison examples :<br>
A formulation of 855 parts of a commercially available - and commonly used for hydrophobic treatment of leather Finishes - non OH-functional fluorocarbon acrylate dispersion having pendant fluroalkyl groups and a solids content of 10,5%; 20 parts flowing agent as described, and 25 parts associative thickener (in this case pure product) was prepared.<br>
This formulation equals the formulations given in table 1 with respect to solids content of fluorocarbon resin and is thus well comparable.<br>
The formulation was divided in two parts; to one part is added crosslinker 1 in an amount resulting in a ratio formulation / crosslinker of 9:1.<br>
The second part of the formulation is mixed with equal amounts of crosslinkers 1 and 3; resulting in a ratio formulation /crosslinkerl / crosslinker 3 of 9: 0,5 : 0,5.<br>
Both resin / crosslinker formulations are applied on the test leather in a way identical to the described application method. The leathers are then dried as described.<br>
Then the two resulting test specimens are soiled with the permanent marker and cleaning with the cleaning cream was tried as described.<br>
Result: the leathers cannot be cleaned without damage of the antisoil topcoat. On treatment with the cleaning cream, the topcoat was removed also nearly completely, which results in severe change of aspect and gloss, thus clearly indicating, that this product doesn't work. Judgement of the cleaning result in both cases is only 1-2!! due to the observed surface damage.<br>
According to the bad cleaning result, no additional tests were made.<br>
Use of products according to the invention as topcoat components, to improve antisoil properties; especially martindale performance<br>

For airless spraying the mix is adjusted to a viscosity of 26 sec (4 mm cup); using the associative thickener described already.<br>
After application of this mix, the leathers prepared were dried at 70-80°C for about 10 minutes and stored for one day at ambient temperature. Subsequently the leathers were embossed (grain pattern milled pebble, rotopress at 100°C, 180 bar, 5m/sec).<br>
After this, the leathers are ready for application of the different antisoil topcoats. Topcoats used, are as follows:<br>
a)	Reference topcoat, acrylic, consisting of:<br>

180 parts of water<br>
c)	Trial topcoats acrylic:<br>
these topcoats differ from reference acrylic topcoat formulation only in that 100 parts of the extreme low TG acrylic component are replaced with 100 parts of anti soil component described in synthetic example 1 (trial topcoat cl) or with 100 parts of anti soil component described in synthetic example 9 (trial topcoat c2) respectively. All other components are not changed.<br>
d)	Trial topcoats PUR:<br>
these topcoats differ from reference PUR topcoat formulation only in that the 90 parts of the high modulus polyether polyurethane component, as well as the 90 parts of the mixed polyether polycarbonate polyurethane are both reduced to 80 parts and the water is reduced to 150 parts. Introduced in the formulation are either 100 parts of anti soil component described in synthetic example 1 (trial topcoat dl) or 100 parts of the anti soil component described in synthetic example 9 (trial topcoat d2).<br>
All other components are not changed.<br>
Application of topcoats a) - d):<br>
all topcoats are applied the same way, namely:<br>
about 900 parts of each topcoat is adjusted to a viscosity of ca. 26 sec (4 mm cup) as described already for the base coat. Then lOOparts of crosslinker 2 are added. The resulting activated mix is sprayed twice (with intermediate drying) onto the base - coated leather specimens, each spray coat adding 0,7 g (dry) per squarefoot topcoat to the leather specimen. After drying for 10 min at 60°C and staying overnight, the resulting finished leathers were tested for fastness properties and martindale performance.<br>
Results obtained are given in table 2<br>
Table 2:	Properties of leathers having anti soil components in the topcoat, compared<br>
to those without these components<br>
(Table Removed))<br>
Comment on the results:<br>
Apparently fastness properties of all finished leathers are not negatively affected by integrating the anti soil components into the topcoat formulations.<br>
With respect to the Martindale results one can state, that integration of the anti soil components is advantageous. The differences observed here fit well to our experience. In general, acrylic topcoats show better martindale performance, compared to PUR topcoats. This difference can be seen in our results also.<br>
