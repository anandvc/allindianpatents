3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a spinning machine with a drawing frame for drawing a sliver, e.g. of cotton, polyester etc., with at least one drafting zone formed by two spaced out drawing organs, a drive system for determining the drawing height in at least one drafting zone, at least one in-line inlet sensor ahead of the drawing frame and/or at least one in-line outlet sensor after the drawing frame for determining of sliver cross section or the fiber mass per length unit of incoming or outgoing sliver sections, and devices for generating at least one each of Amplitude Frequency Function (spectrogram) and/or Amplitude Time Function (diagram) from the measuring signals of the inlet and/or outlet sensor. Similarly the invention relates to a suitable procedure.<br>
There are known spinning machines with a drawing frame, in which at entry and exit spectrograms of the sliver - i.e. an Amplitude Frequency Function for obtaining periodic errors by means of suitably built-up sensors, can be generated and graphically represented. So, for example, from the US 5,509,179 is known, to gain signals from spectrogram of each of the incoming and des outgoing material, in order to facilitate better control and regulation of the drawing process. Similar is known from the EP 574 693, in which also at the entry and exit of the drawing arrangement a spectrogram is recorded, in order to identify correctable deviations within the analyzed signals and to calculate suitable correction values.<br>
Similarly, it is known, to remove a longer piece of drawn sliver at the exit of the machine and to measure it in a lab measuring device (in a so-called Uster-Tester). If only the last referred system is deployed, then this information can be used only to decide, whether the sliver meets the desired requirements or not.<br>
Similarly, it is known, to setup Amplitude Time Functions in the form of so-called diagram, from which stochastic errors of the fiber material can be detected, for example thick and thin points.<br>
The disadvantage in these known equipment is that the information content from the spectrograms and diagrams is not optimally exhausted. It is, therefore, the task of this invention, to better utilize the information of spectrograms and/or diagrams obtained at the inlet and/or outlet and, if necessary, those obtained by means of a lab measuring device.<br>
2<br><br>
This task is resolved in the procedure and the equipment of the type mentioned at the beginning through the characteristics of the independent claims.<br>
The advantages of the invention can be seen especially in the fact, mat the spectrograms<br>
and/or diagrams of the inlet sensor, outlet sensor and/or a lab measuring device (at least two of these three) with the help of the CPU (for example a microprocessor) and the suitable software program to be processed by it, are correlated with each other, in order to get hints for the cause of sliver mass fluctuations at the outgoing or drawn sliver. In this kind of evaluation - with an advantage - one can draw a conclusion, as to at which point of the spinning machine errors have occurred or cannot be compensated in the drawing frame.<br>
According to the invention all three sensors need not be present; for the execution of the invention it is rather sufficient, if spectrograms or diagrams from at least two of the said sensors are compared with each other.<br>
Especially, here the origin of a sliver error can be localized by the CPU in such a way, that this has occurred before the inlet sensor and/or between the inlet and outlet sensor. Further, preferably the spectrogram or the diagram of the inlet sensor is super-imposed with that of the outlet sensor and these, if necessary, are calibrated to each other, in order to pinpoint sliver error origins on the basis of deviations of both spectrograms or diagrams.<br>
If, for example, at the inlet sensor in the spectrogram or in the diagram an error is found and also at the outlet sensor, one can conclude, that there is material error present, which could not be eliminated in the drawing frame. If, on the other hand, a deviation from the norm occurs in the outlet spectrogram or in the outlet diagram, which is not present in the inlet spectrogram or inlet diagram, then it can be assumed, that in the drawing frame, i.e. between the inlet and the outlet sensor there is faulty setting or otherwise an error origin.<br>
The sliver sections to be compared with each other correspond advantageously with each other, so that at a time sliver sections with the same fibers are compared. This is helpful especially for very precise measurements. If that kind of precision is not essential and especially if periodic errors occurs along the entire length of sliver, a correspondence is not<br>
3<br><br>
absolutely necessary, since in matching selection of time windows the information - for example, in consecutive sliver sections - with respect to periodic error is mostly the same.<br>
The definition, when there a case of error and when the sliver deviation is within the norm, is naturally definition dependent, wherein corresponding marginal values can be adjusted advantageously by the user.<br>
Also, by means of the invention it can determined, whether a sliver error has occurred, which can be ascribed to the outlet sensor. For this case, instead of a comparison of both spectrograms and/or diagrams at the inlet and outlet - or in addition to this - also the spectrogram and/or diagram of the drawn sliver, which is normally taken for this purpose from a filled can and measured under lab conditions is used. For this purpose, a consistency checking device is suitable, normally, it is known under the name Uster Tester and is briefly referred to above as lab measuring device. Especially through the comparison of the spectrogram or diagram of this lab measuring device with at least the spectrogram or diagram of the outgoing sensor it can be concluded, whether an error has occurred in the sliver on the drawing arrangement between the outlet sensor and the can, for example, due to a wrong sliver tensioning in the rotary table, by which the sliver is placed in loops in the can.<br>
Generally, in the spectrogram evaluation a distinction is made between drawing waves on the one hand and drawing disturbances, which do not have any specific pattern of recurrence and in the spectrogram as a broad statistics of several spectrogram lines, and on the other hand mechanical errors, which recur in strict periodic pattern and occur in the spectrogram as statistics of one or two spectrogram lines. The first mentioned error occurs due to floating fibers in the drawing frame area. These drawing waves can occur, if the drawing frame settings are faulty, which then lead to uncontrolled short fibers and thus to floating fibers.<br>
Also the sliver funnel may be selected as too narrow or the drawing frame load is set as too low. Further, unsuitable top roller coats can be a reason for drawing waves.<br>
4<br><br>
As against this, strictly periodic or mechanical errors can occur through different gear parts or working components, e.g. due to hitting cylinders, defective bearings, oval or flattened top rollers, defective or contaminated belts, belt pulleys or gear wheels.<br>
In the invention based comparison of at least two spectrograms non-strict as well as strict periodic errors can be identified relatively easy, so that not only the area before, in or after the drawing frame can be pinpointed, but also the error source and thereby at least also the error location and/or error type can be identified.<br>
A comparison of diagram, for example, by means of cross-correlation carried out by the CPU, is possible, if the case for especially thick and/or thin locations or the degree of error removal through drawing in the drawing frame should be analyzed. If, for example, through the inlet sensor a thick location before the drawing frame is measured with a sliver thickness variation of 15 % along a specific length, say 50 cm, and if this thick location is reduced through drawing to a deviation of still 10%, then the origin for this defective result can looked for in the drawing frame, for example, in a faulty top roller loading. Especially, relatively long thick and thin locations can then be regulated with correction. Similarly, it can be ascertained, whether due to drawing process itself thick or thin locations occur in the drawing frame.<br>
Especially beneficial is, if on the basis of invention based comparison the error origin is graphically displayed to the user, so that he can immediately remove the cause for the same. For this purpose, it is possible, to use monitor screen normally available at a spinning machine, for example in a drawing arrangement.<br>
The advantage is that not only a hint about the error origin but also a recommendation for removal of error can be given to the user. Both these details can be combined, if, for example,<br>
on the monitor screen in a displayed gear plan a cylinder or roller bearing is displayed, so that the user knows, that he has to check or replace this bearing.<br>
If there are several possible error origins, then also a specific suggestion can be given to the user on the screen, for accurately localizing the error or finally removing the same either<br>
5<br><br>
immediately or through systematic approach by means of, for example stepwise trying out. In localization it is identified, whether the error depends on the entire drawing, pre-drawing, delivery speed and/or on the regulation. It can be analyzed, whether the error is in the context of the sliver storage and hereby a real or an unreal error is registered. Such a catalogue of suggestions includes preferably, the change of the entire drawing, the change of the pre-drawing in case of two consecutive drafting zones with constant entire drawing, the change of the main drawing, the change of one or more drawing distances, the change of drawing frame loading, a change of top roller coat, a change of regulation deployment point, a replacement of the sliver funnel at the drawing frame exit, a change of rotary table speed, a change of delivery speed of the sliver leaving the drawing frame, a position change of a compression bar in a drafting zone and/or a replacement of a faulty top roller etc.. Also, a hint can be given to the user, whether settings of a drawing arrangement covering the drawing frame and/or settings of a in-line carding machine or combing machine ahead of the drawing frame should be changed. Here, the carding or combing machine can be a separate machine, or the invention based spinning machine is integrated along with the drawing frame is integrated in a machine of that kind<br>
A sequence of approach suggested by the machine is also to be considered as independent, equipment and process oriented invention aspect, wherein for this invention aspect a comparison of two or three spectrograms or diagrams need not be undertaken. Also for machine side analysis of only one of the said spectrograms or diagrams is an advantageous suggestion from the side of the invention based machine, because hereby a long search in error list, which are normally printed in the manuals, can be saved. To the user a kind of schedule is provided - by an advantage of a display of invention based machine, where he should try, to first remove the error. Especially, in case of several possible error causes, the machine can suggest the user on the basis of an electronically saved error catalogue and, if necessary, also through machine specific, equally electronically saved historic values (self-learning error catalogue), which error cause is more likely and the user, therefore, should try to rectify the error first there.<br>
For both the invention aspects it applies, that specially preferred in suitable design of the spinning machine, particularly through servomotor etc., the measures for error correction are<br>
6<br><br>
automatically executable. For this purpose a corrective command is initiated by the CPU and is implemented by a control element, in order to automatically change, for example, the entire and/or the pre-drawing, in order to achieve a better error localization or even error removal. Thus, at least a part of error search and thus, if necessary, a better error localization can automatically happen.<br>
In case of a successive tracking of an error - which was earlier detected only intermittently -preferably a fresh invention based evaluation of two of the spectrograms - or even all three -can be undertaken, for example, that of inlet and outlet spectrogram and, if necessary, adding further the spectrogram of the drawn sliver recorded by means of the sensor of a lab measuring device. Thereafter, in an ideal situation another optimization step towards removal of error(s) can be taken. Same is applicable for the case of diagram evaluation.<br>
The invention based spinning machine characterizes itself through a CPU, which undertakes the invention based comparative evaluation of at least two spectrograms or diagrams. This CPU can be either a central CPU of the spinning machine or a separate CPU. The software for the CPU is designed in such a way, that on the basis of comparison of both the spectrograms or diagrams a localization of the sliver error origin can be undertaken.<br>
The CPU can preferably process values from a lab measuring device with sliver consistency check function like for example with the Uster-Tester, which a user provides to the CPU through an input device or can be transmitted also via cable, radio, infrared signals etc. from the lab measuring device to the CPU. Accordingly, the CPU can also integrate the values of the lab measuring device in the calculation of the error origin, thus especially for determining an error, which has occurred in conjunction with the outlet sensor.<br>
Specially, the CPU uses an error catalogue, which practically covers an electronic database and the CPU allows, to obtain the error origin through an expert system analysis and to preferably localize this in the area before the inlet sensor, after the outlet sensor or between both these sensors. Especially, the CPU can pinpoint to different error origins, particularly the Error cause, the error location and/ or the error type. Under the error type here strictly periodic and not strictly periodic (from spectrogram analysis) and stochastic (from diagram<br>
7<br><br>
analysis) errors are covered. The section following the outlet sensor can be localized, however, only by adding the spectrogram or the diagram evaluation of the sensor of the aforesaid lab measuring device, since the spectrograms or the diagrams of the inlet and the outlet sensor do not differentiate in this respect.<br>
In the said electronically saved error catalogue preferably the entire known error origins or their effects on the standard spectrogram or standard diagram are contained. Double indications, which occurred so far in the evaluation of the outlet spectrogram (outlet diagram), can be eliminated through a comparative evaluation of the inlet and outlet spectrogram (or the corresponding diagrams), especially when two possible error origins exist, wherein a possible error origin can exist before the inlet sensor and a possible error origin after the inlet sensor. The error catalogue can remove this double indication and can precisely indicate the error origin through the information from the invention based comparative evaluation, in which these two sections of errors have occurred.<br>
For this purpose, especially the said monitor screen has been provided for the user, that gives graphic presentations of suggestions to him for approach and, if necessary, displays the sequence of suggestions with respect to the measures to be taken. The CPU or the central processor is here preferably in the position, to suggest the next logical step through if-then queries and from the suitable inputs of the user. Thus in case of complicated cases a stepwise error identification and then error removal can be achieved.<br>
For example, on presentation of a periodic, but not immediately localizable error, it may be suggested to the user, first to change the entire drawing with the regulation being ON. If the periodic error does not shift, the cause can be in a defective delivery bottom roller, defective delivery top roller or in a defective deflecting top roller. It is also possible, that the error occurs after the exit of the material from the drawing frame, or that it is a so-called unreal error, for example, it may be occurring in the can storage. If the periodic error shifts on changing the entire drawing, it is suggested, to change the pre-drawing with the constant entire drawing. If during this the periodic error does not shift, then the error occurs before entry of the fiber material in the drawing frame due to the entry bottom roller or entry top roller or due to the drawing frame drive. If the periodic error shifts, then it means the middle<br>
8<br><br>
bottom or top roller is defective.<br>
The processing of one or more wave lengths, which are taken from a spectrogram of a lab<br>
measuring device, represents another independent invention aspect, which is reproduced in<br>
the claims 23 and 24. Also for this invention aspect no comparative evaluation of at least two or three spectrograms or diagrams is necessary. This separate invention aspect rather refers to the evaluation of mainly spectrogram data (or also diagram data) in a CPU of the spinning machine, wherein the data was obtained externally, namely with the help of a lab measuring device, for example, by means of a Uster-Tester. The user can either enter the relevant data manually through an input device of the invention based spinning machine or a data line (cable, radio, infrared etc.) is responsible for this transmission of information. Especially, wavelength(s) from a spectrogram of the lab measuring device can be analyzed by the CPU of the machine by means of an error catalogue, to which the CPU has an access, and on a display of the machine hints about the error cause and advantageously also concrete hints for their removal can be given to the user.<br>
Through suitable machine design even an automatic error removal can be provided for, i.e. without intervention by the user, who is merely prompted and must confirm, whether he agrees to a specific automatic intervention.<br>
In the context of the last said invention aspect, for example, one can have the wavelength processed with the help of a spectrogram of sliver section measured by the CPU of the spinning machine by the help of a lab measuring device, which has run through an unregulated drawing arrangement. After the analysis by the CPU the user can follow the respective outputted error hint. In case regulated drawing arrangement, particularly those with individual drives, if necessary, an automatic removal of faulty settings can follow with respect to the regulation.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are marked by the features of the sub-claims.<br>
In the following, the invention is described more in detail on the basis of the single figure,<br>
9<br><br>
which shows a schematic side view of a drawing arrangement as example for a spinning machine (here to be precise: spinning preparation machine). According to this example, several - mainly reversed - slivers FB (these are shown here only from top) next to each other. It is also possible, to feed only one sliver FB to the drawing arrangement, which is placed directly by an in-line carding or combing machine. At the entry of the drawing arrangement a funnel 12 is arranged, which compresses the slivers FB. Alternatively, other compression devices can be used. After running through another scanning device 2, 3 described below as part of an inlet sensor 1 the now compressed sliver FBI, which consists of several individual slivers, is guided in a drawing frame 4, which forms the core component of the drawing arrangement. The drawing frame 4 normally has three drawing elements or rollers pairs, between which the actual drawing takes place. These are the entry roller pair 5a, 5b, the middle roller pair 6a, 6b and the exit or also called delivery roller pair 7a, 7b, which rotate together in this sequence each at increased peripheral speed. Through these different peripheral speeds of the roller pairs the sliver FB', which is spread in the drawing frame like a spun yarn, is drawn according to the ratio of peripheral speeds. The spun yarn type sliver FB' is here the sliver in the sense of the invention.<br>
The entry roller pair 5a, 5b and the middle roller pair 6a, 6b form the so-called pre-drawing zone, the middle roller pair 6a, 6b and the delivery roller pair 7a, 7b the so-called main drafting zone. In case of unregulated drawing arrangements during the drawing process the pre-drawing as well as the main drawing is constant. Whereas, in case of regulated drawing arrangements a regulation follows through change of drawing height. In a regulated drawing frame one can also change the pre as well as the main drawing, however, almost always the main drawing get selected. The reason for this lies in the fact, that the main drawing is larger, so that a more accurate regulation can be undertaken.<br>
Normally, an additional compression bar 8 is arranged in the main drafting zone; which deflects the sliver FB1 and thus ensure a better guidance of the fibers, particularly, that of not clamped between two roller pairs (so-called floating fibers). The drawn sliver FB' is compiled with the help of a deflection top roller 9 and a sliver forming device 10 and is placed in a can 18 via a calendar roller pair 13, 14 and a inclined sliver channel 16, which is arranged in a rotary table 17 which rotates with an angular speed VL.<br>
10<br><br>
For compensating the sliver mass fluctuations at regulated drawing arrangements the pre-placed slivers FB normally run through an in-line scanning device ahead of drawing frame 4, which in the represented design example consists of two scanning discs 2, 3 and is a part of a sliver cross section measuring equipment. The scanning disc 2 is built-up as locally fix, whereas scanning disc 3, which is pressed with pressure against the scanning disc 2, can be manipulated vertically to its axis of rotation. The manipulations of the scanning disc 3 are herein a measure for the band cross section of the sliver FB1, which is guided between both the scanning discs. In the represented design form the scanning disc 3 is coupled with an inductive measuring element 20 (measuring value converter), whose output signal in the form of electrical voltage signals first forwarded to a memory 21, which considers the path or the time difference of a sliver section between the passage of scanning device 2, 3 and the entry in the drawing frame 4 (FIFO-memory = First-In-First-Out-memory), and then is forwarded after the expiry of this time difference to a evaluation and regulation unit 22. The evaluation and regulation unit 22 gives accordingly a control command for compensating the mass fluctuations through changing the peripheral speeds of the middle roller pair 6a, 6b and, if necessary, of entry roller pair 5a, 5b. The compensation of mass fluctuations in the main drafting zone is achieved in this case through the change in the speed of a servo drive 23, which generates a control speed for a planetary gear 24. with this controlled output speed of the planetary gear 24, in which a main motor 25 drives, the scanning disc 2, the bottom rollers 5a, 6a of the entry roller pair 5a, 5b and middle roller pair 6a, 6b are driven. The speed of the bottom roller 7a driven by the main motor 25 remains apparently constant and ensures an exactly calculable sliver production. Similarly, the main motor 25 drives the calendar roller 13, which takes along the calendar roller 14 through friction.<br>
Similar to the scanning disc 3 the calendar roller 14 is also manipulated by the sliver FB' running through between the calendar rollers 13, 14, wherein the manipulations are measured, for example, by an inductive measuring element 15 (measuring value converter). The calendar roller pair 13, 14 as well as the measuring element 15 form an outlet sensor 11. The measuring signals of the measuring element 15 are transmitted to the evaluation and regulation unit 22, which are connected with two devices 28, 29 for the formation of spectrograms SE or SA. Herein, the device 28, in which an electronic memory for the measuring signals of the inlet sensor 1 is integrated, generates a spectrogram SE from these<br>
11<br><br>
measuring signals, whereas the device 29, which similarly contains an electronic memory for the measuring signals of the outlet sensor 11, generates a spectrogram SA from these measuring signals. The electronic memories can of course be separate components of the<br>
devices 28,29.<br>
The evaluation of both the spectrograms SE, SA can follow on time basis. The time functions can then be converted by means of Fast-Fourier-Analysis in the frequency range. The number of frequency channels to be represented individually is for example 1024 or 2048.<br>
In-line after both the devices 28, 29 is a CPU 30 (for example, a microprocessor), which compares with each other, in accordance with the aforesaid design example, both the spectrograms SE, SA of devices 28, 29 belonging advantageously to the same sliver section by using a suitable software program. Herein, both the spectrograms SE, SA, if necessary, are prepared in such a way - for example through upsetting and/or calibrating -, that these can be placed as matching above each other. For example, here the drawing height of the drawn sliver is to be considered in comparison with the yet non-drawn sliver FB placed before the drawing frame 4.<br>
For the purpose of evaluation the CPU 30 has access to a database 31, which contains an error catalogue - advantageously also self-learning, to ascertain the error origin through an expert system analysis. In the error catalogue the causes of strict periodic and not strict periodic sliver errors are saved, especially, the allocations of defective rollers, bearings, belts etc. to wavelengths obvious in the spectrogram, for which statistics occur in the spectrogram. Statistics across several channels provide otherwise a hint to not strict periodic error (drawing waves), which occur e.g. due to faulty drawing frame settings, too low drawing frame load, unsuitable top roller coats or due to too narrow sliver forming device at the drawing frame exit. The respective characteristics for the strict periodic and not strict periodic error and their respective allocation to the error origins are stored in the database 31 and are used for the comparison as described here of both the spectrograms SE, SA.<br>
A precedent goal of the said comparison is, to localize error origins and that means according to the represented design example preferably in the area before the inlet sensor 1,<br>
12<br><br>
after the outlet sensor 11 or between both these sensors 1,11. For this purpose, the inlet and the outlet spectrogram SE, SA are place above each other and, if necessary, differences are recorded. In case if both the spectrograms SE, SA are to a great extent same and show the same error at same wavelength, it can be assumed, that there is an inherent material error and the drawing frame settings are correct. As against this, if in the outlet spectrogram SA an error occurs, which did not exist in the inlet spectrogram SE, then it is a clear indication of the fact, that on the stretch between both the sensor 1, 11 there is a drawing frame faulty setting or a defect in the machine components.<br>
In the state of technology errors were analyzed only on the basis of evaluation of the outlet spectrogram SA. Thus, multiple indications (different possibilities for an error apparent from the spectrogram) could not be triggered without reason during the spectrogram analysis, especially, when the spectrogram contained several overlapping errors and/or the sliver quality, particularly the CV value was not optimal, so that the spectrogram did not correspond to the standard spectrogram with clearly projecting error wavelengths. Through the possibility of said localization the error determination becomes easy and thus also the error removal.<br>
The CPU 30 outputs the result of the spectrogram comparison preferably on a monitor screen 32 at the machine. Herein, an additional suggestion can be made to the user for removing the error. Through the localization of the error origin the error can be more clearly defined, so that the user, if necessary, must undertake a fewer measures for removing the error. The said suggestions can be broadly dispersed. These can include: change of the entire drawing, change of the pre-drawing in case of two consecutive drafting zones with constant entire drawing, change of the main drawing, change of one or more drawing distances, change of drawing frame load, change or replacement of top roller coats, change of regulation deployment point, replacement of sliver funnel at the drawing frame outlet, change of rotary table speed and/ or replacement of a faulty top roller, changes in the settings at the drawing arrangement of in-line textile machines placed ahead.<br>
The CPU 30 can advantageously and also automatically suggest a suggested sequence or can initiate such, wherein the respective previous measure and the subsequent spectrogram<br>
13<br><br>
comparison because of fresh measurement can lead to a next suggestion, if the error continues to exist or if a new error occurs. This iterative procedure lead ultimately to error removal based on the suggestions of the CPU under reference of allocations stored in the database.<br>
In order to carry out an optimized automatic error search, the CPU 30 can ask the user for input of certain information, to facilitate better localization of the error. For this purpose the user can use an input device 33, for example a touch screen, in order to provide e.g. material parameters to the CPU 30. it can also be provided, that the machine asks the user via the display 32, whether an automatic error search is desired, which can be confirmed or otherwise by the user. Later possibility can, for example, occur, if the user already sees the error or knows it in a different way.<br>
Further, a lab measuring device 27 serving as consistency checking device (shown in Figure 1 on a table T), for example the known Uster-Tester, can be referred to, for generating a spectrogram SL of a drawn and, if necessary, sliver FB' placed in a can, and that means as per an invention aspect as compared with the inlet and/ or outlet spectrum SE, SA, and as per another invention aspect for the lone analysis (no comparison) by means of said CPU 30 of the spinning machine. For this purpose, in both the cases at least a longer sliver piece is measured under defined lab conditions.<br>
If a spectrogram comparison is prepared, then sliver sections advantageously corresponding with each other are compared, so that accurate statements within a selected time window are possible for certain sliver lengths. However, this is not compulsory in all cases, but it, for example, depends on, whether a periodic error exists along the entire sliver, so that the error exists in every sliver section. Here the slivers sections being compared need not correspond with each other, since, in time windows selected large enough the information about consecutive sliver sections is same with respect to this error.<br>
If, as per the second said case (lone evaluation of the lab spectrogram SL) the user discovers, for example, a fault suspected wavelength in the spectrogram SL of the lab measuring device 27, then he can transmit this wave length through manual input in the input device 33 to the<br>
14<br><br>
CPU 30 (discontinuous arrow), which undertakes an error analysis. For this purpose, it preferably accesses the database 31 with the integrated error catalogue. On the monitor screen 32 to the user the error origin and/or error removal measures can be intimated. Instead of a manual input the values from the lab measuring device 27 can also be transmitted by electronic data transmission to the CPU.<br>
In a comparison of the spectrogram SL of the lab measuring device 27 with the spectrogram SA at least of the outlet sensor 11 one can draw a conclusion, whether a sliver error was caused upstream of the outlet sensor 11 or whether it has occurred on the path between outlet sensor 11 and can 18, for example and especially while placing the sliver in can. In the later case the error would appear only in the spectrogram SL of the lab measuring device 27, whereas not in the inlet and outlet spectrogram SE, SA.<br>
The above described design example is based on a spectrogram comparison. An alternative or additional evaluation of corresponding diagram with respect to stochastic error (e.g. thin and thick locations) is also possible without restriction.<br>
Changes in the invention, as these were explained on the basis of the figure, are possible any way. Thus, particularly in place of the mechanically scanning inlet sensor 1 and/or outlet sensor 11 one each of a microwave sensor with a hollow space resonator can be used, by means of which sliver mass per unit length can be obtained without physical contact. This kind of microwave sensors are the state of technology and do not need to be explained here more in detail. Also the CPU 30 can be integrated in the evaluation and regulation unit 22 or in a superordinated machine control. The invention can be used for unregulated as well as for regulated drawing arrangements as also in general for spinning preparation machines with a drawing frame.<br>
