PISTON TOP CHAMFER DESIGN TO REDUCE NOISE AND FRICTION<br>
TECHNICAL HELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention is directed to pistons having a head and skirt<br>
portions together with a top chamfer designed to channel oil to the center of the piston<br>
skirt to reduce piston noise and friction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	As is known in the art, the oil lubrication of pistons in internal combustion<br>
engines, such as automotive engines, may be less than optimum in particular situations<br>
and under certain engine operating conditions. A lack of optimum levels of lubrication<br>
around portions of the piston or skirt periphery can lead to increased piston noise as well<br>
as increased friction, in severe cases leading to increased chance of scoring of the piston<br>
skirt and cylinder liner or wall. Less than optimum lubrication can result in increased<br>
piston noise independent of scuffing, scoring and wear issues.<br>
[0003]	A greater portion of the side stress developed during piston operation is<br>
known to occur in regions referred to as the thrust faces. The thrust faces are located on<br>
opposing sides of the piston and skirt and aligned perpendicularly to the ends of the<br>
piston pin bore. During fuel combustion in the power stroke, side thrust loads become<br>
concentrated at the thrust faces. As is known in the art, these high stress regions are<br>
subject to greater pressure and frictional force developed against the cylinder wall<br>
resulting in increased operating noise and ultimately to greater wear.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	While scuffing and scoring of the piston skirt and the adjacent cylinder<br>
wall results in increased noise, increased piston noise can also occur without the presence<br>
of scuffing or scoring. When adequate lubrication is provided to the piston and skirt, the<br>
piston skirt and cylinder wall are protected against scuffing and scoring. Enhancing this<br>
level of lubrication, particularly at the middle portions of the piston skirt advantageously<br>
acts to further reduce piston noise. Unlike scuffing and scoring that may occur with the<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
2<br>
engine operating under significant load, piston noise is more likely to be an issue in low<br>
speed, no load or low lead engine operating conditions. The present invention is directed<br>
to a piston configured to enhance lubrication to the middle portions of the piston skirt to<br>
reduce this piston noise.<br>
[0005]	The present invention disclosed herein provides an internal combustion<br>
engine piston having a top chamfer designed to reduce noise and friction. The piston<br>
disclosed herein has a piston head portion and an adjoining skirt portion provided with<br>
the novel design tapered top chamfer. The top chamfer is an annular channel about the<br>
circumference of the piston configured as a bevel on at least one of its sidewalls. The top<br>
chamfer at least partially defines a tapered volume configured to channel oil towards the<br>
middle portions or thrust faces of the skirt so as to increase lubrication and thereby<br>
reduce piston noise as well as friction and wear. By enlarging the chamfer-defined<br>
volume in the middle portion of the skirt proximate to the thrust faces, oil circulation in<br>
the circumferential direction is enhanced. The tapered volume defined by the top chamfer<br>
increases oil availability to the middle portions of the skirt having the thrust faces at<br>
which the piston/liner contact and side thrust forces are concentrated.<br>
[0006]	One of the major functions of the piston top chamfer is to serve as an oil<br>
reservoir. The volume of oil in the top chamfer can account for between twenty to<br>
seventy percent of the available oil, depending upon skirt profile and clearance, of the<br>
entire volume between the piston skirt and the cylinder bore liner. During the down<br>
stroke of the piston, oil enters the piston skirt region in an area between the bottom<br>
chamfer of the piston skirt and the cylinder bore liner. While in the down stroke, the oil<br>
travels upward along the side of the piston skirt (oil flow being described relative to the<br>
motion of the piston and skirt), reaching the top chamfer and filling the top chamfer.<br>
Further upward movement of the oil relative to the piston and skirt is effectively inhibited<br>
by the wiping action of the oil control ring located above the top chamfer. The oil control<br>
ring seals the space between the piston and the cylinder bore wall above the top chamfer,<br>
causing oil to accumulate into the top chamfer.<br>
[0007]	A piston having a top chamfer design to reduce noise and friction<br>
according to the present invention includes a head portion having an annular groove<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
3<br>
formed into the circumference of the head portion. The annular groove is sized and<br>
adapted for receiving an oil control ring to inhibit oil migration between the piston and<br>
the cylinder bore wall. The piston includes a skirt portion adjoining and attached to the<br>
head portion at an upper portion of the skirt portion. The skirt portion includes two<br>
opposing middle skirt portions, each having a thrust face, as well as two opposing side<br>
skirt portions. The opposing side skirt portions extend between and joinably connect the<br>
opposing middle skirt portions. The piston head has a bore therethrough for receiving a<br>
piston pin to connect the piston to a crankshaft. The side skirt portions on the piston skirt<br>
portion are generally aligned with the opposing ends of the piston pin bore in the piston<br>
head portion. As discussed above, the top chamfer is configured to at least partially<br>
define a tapered volume or cavity for receiving oil and is formed into the piston in a<br>
position adjacent or below the annular groove for the oil control ring. The top chamfer is<br>
formed to provide a volume configured to preferentially store and deliver a larger<br>
quantity of oil proximate to the middle skirt portion in comparison to the quantity of oil<br>
stored proximate to the side skirt portions.<br>
[0008]	According to one aspect of the invention, the top chamfer is located<br>
proximate to the annular groove for the oil control ring.<br>
[0009]	According to another aspect of the invention, the annular groove is located<br>
proximate to said skirt portion.<br>
[0010]	According to another aspect of the invention, the skirt portion includes a<br>
bottom chamfer formed into the circumference of the skirt portion. The bottom chamfer<br>
is positioned such that the top chamfer lies between the bottom chamfer and the oil<br>
control ring annular groove.<br>
[0011]	According to another aspect of the invention, the volume defined by the<br>
top chamfer is varied along the circumferential wall of the piston by varying the angle at<br>
which the chamfer is cut. For example, cutting the chamfer at a shallower angle relative<br>
to the circumferential wall of the piston results in a wider top chamfer capable of storing<br>
more oil per unit of circumferential length of the top chamfer.<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
4<br>
[0012]	According to another aspect of the invention, the top chamfer is cut into<br>
the wall of the annular oil control ring groove, substantially the wall below the oil control<br>
ring.<br>
[0013]	According to another aspect of the invention, the depth of the top chamfer<br>
about the circumference of the piston is formed deeper into the piston skirt portion at the<br>
middle skirt portion relative to the depth of the top chamfer proximate to the side skirt<br>
portions so as to preferentially provide for storage of a larger quantity of oil proximate to<br>
the middle skirt portion relative to the quantity of oil storable proximate to the side skirt<br>
portions.<br>
[0014]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

[0019]	Figure 3C is a schematic view of a piston having a stepped tapered volume<br>
top chamfer consistent with the present invention; and<br>
[0020]	Figures 4A, 4B and 4C illustrate various top chamfer configurations<br>
formed into a portion of the piston wall at the annular groove for the oil control ring.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0021]	Figure 1 illustrates a side view of a piston 110 having a piston head<br>
portion 112 and skirt portion 116 provided with a traditional non-tapered top or axially<br>
upper chamfer 124. The piston 110 has an oil control ring groove 130 located above and<br>
proximate to the top chamfer 124. The top chamfer 124 and oil control ring groove 130<br>
are located below the piston ring grooves 146.<br>
[0022]	Figure 2 illustrates a side view of a piston 10 having a piston head portion<br>
12 and skirt portion 16 equipped with a top chamfer 24 and a bottom chamfer 28. The top<br>
chamfer 24 defines a tapered volume profile configured to preferentially store and deliver<br>
a larger quantity of oil to the middle skirt portion 26 (depicted as the region between<br>
boundary lines 44) to increase lubrication thereat and thereby reduce piston noise,<br>
consistent with the present invention. In Figure 2, the skirt portion 16 of the piston 10<br>
includes a top chamfer 24 located proximate to and directly below the annular oil control<br>
ring groove 30. The top chamfer 24 may be formed as a taper into a portion of the wall<br>
of oil control ring groove 30 as shown in Figure 2, or alternately the top chamfer 24 may<br>
be provided as a separate annular groove formed into the skirt 16 directly below the oil<br>
control ring groove 30. In another alternate embodiment, the top chamfer 24 may be<br>
provided as a separate annular groove formed into the skirt 16 at a spaced location<br>
between the oil control ring groove 30 and the bottom chamfer 28. In another<br>
embodiment, the top chamfer 24 is a bevel (224 in Figure 4A) formed onto a top portion<br>
of the skirt 16 wherein the top portion of the skirt 16 forms one wall of the annular<br>
groove 30 holding the oil control ring (36 of Figure 3A) with the remaining portions of<br>
the oil control ring groove 30 formed into a bottom or lower portion of the piston head<br>
portion 12.<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
6<br>
[0023]	When installing the piston 10 into an internal combustion engine (not<br>
shown), an oil control ring 36 (shown schematically later in Figure 3A) is fitted into the<br>
oil control ring groove 30 to seal the space between the piston 10 and the cylinder bore<br>
wall 32 (shown schematically in Figure 3A), trapping oil in the top chamfer 24 during a<br>
piston 10 down stroke. In Figure 2, the piston is illustrated with two annular piston ring<br>
grooves 46 located above the oil control ring grooves 130, 30 respectively.<br>
[0024]	The tapered volume forming the top chamfer 24 is configured to channel<br>
011	towards the middle skirt portion 26 of the piston skirt 16 to increase lubrication in the<br>
middle portion 26 of the skirt 16 and thereby reduce and/or improve piston noise, friction<br>
and wear. By reducing the piston top chamfer 24 cross sectional area or volume per unit<br>
of circumferential length over the two opposing side skirt portions 20 (reduced volume<br>
illustrated by a narrower chamfer width) and enlarging the chamfer volume (volume per<br>
unit length or cross sectional area) in the middle skirt portion 26 of the skirt 16 proximate<br>
to the thrust faces, then oil circulation in the circumferential direction in the top chamfer<br>
24 is enhanced. As can be understood, the tapered volume top chamfer 24 in Figure 2<br>
advantageously increases oil availability to the middle skirt portion 26 of the skirt 16<br>
acting to reduce piston noise arising from piston/liner contact occurring with the<br>
reciprocating movement of the piston 10 in the cylinder bore wall 32 or liner (shown<br>
schematically in Figure 3A).<br>
[0025]	Figure 3A is a schematic view of a piston 10 having a piston head portion<br>
12	and skirt portion 16 equipped with a tapered top chamfer 24, illustrating oil flow<br>
upwardly 38 along the piston skirt portion 16 and cylinder bore wall 32 acting to fill the<br>
top chamfer 24 during the piston 10 down stroke. As discussed above, one of the major<br>
functions of the piston top chamfer 24 is to at least partially serve as an oil reservoir. The<br>
volume of oil defined by the top chamfer 24 can account for between twenty to seventy<br>
percent of the available oil, depending upon skirt profile and clearance, of the entire<br>
volume of the cavity between the piston skirt 16 and the cylinder bore or liner wall 32.<br>
Figure 3A schematically depicts the piston 10 moving downwards relative to the cylinder<br>
bore wall 32 at a velocity V1. It is to be understood that the velocity V1 is variable and is<br>
used in Figure 3A solely to indicate the direction of piston travel. An oil film 34 is<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
7<br>
depicted on only a portion of the cylinder bore wall 32 for convenience and clarity of<br>
illustration. It is understood that the oil film 34 coats the major portion of the cylinder<br>
wall 32 during engine operation. The oil film 34 travels upward 38 along the side of the<br>
piston skirt 16 (oil flow described relative to the motion of the piston and skirt), reaching<br>
the top chamfer 24. The oil film 34 on the cylinder bore wall 32 is swept up into the<br>
tapered volume top chamfer 24 by the wiping action of the oil control ring 36 against the<br>
cylinder wall 32 as the piston 10 executes a down stroke. As the top chamfer 24 fills, oil<br>
flows circumferentially 40 in the top chamfer 24 due to the larger reservoir volume in the<br>
middle skirt portion 26 of the top chamfer 24, as discussed earlier.<br>
[0026]	Figure 3B is a schematic view of a piston 10 equipped with a piston head<br>
portion 12 and skirt portion 16 including a tapered volume top chamfer 24 design. Figure<br>
3B schematically illustrates the top chamfer 24 providing increased lubrication to the<br>
middle skirt portion 26 of the piston skirt 16 during an up stroke, consistent with the<br>
present invention. In Figure 3B, the piston 10 is depicted in an up stroke, traveling<br>
upwardly at an instantaneous velocity V2 relative to the cylinder bore wall 32. As in<br>
Figure 3A, the instantaneous velocity vector V2 is shown only to indicate the direction of<br>
travel of the piston 10 relative to the cylinder bore wall 32, and not to indicate a particular<br>
or uniform velocity. Oil gathered into the top chamfer 24 during the down stroke (shown<br>
in Figure 3A) now flows from the top chamfer 24 on the skirt portion 16 to provide a<br>
continuous oil supply lubricating the skirt portion 16 during the up stroke. The top<br>
chamfer 24 has a tapered volume (shown by the tapered width of the top chamfer 24)<br>
providing increased oil availability (indicated by downward arrows 48) to the middle<br>
skirt portion 26. The side skirt portions 20 are generally aligned with the bore (not<br>
shown) in the piston 10 that receives a pin (not shown) to hold the piston 10 to the<br>
connecting rod (not shown). The middle skirt portions 26 bridge between the side skirt<br>
portions 20 on the circumference of the piston skirt 16. The top chamfer 24 is illustrated<br>
in Figure 3B has having a width W4 that increases continuously along the chamfer 24<br>
from the side skirt portions 20 to the middle skirt portion 26.<br>
[0027]	Figure 3C is a schematic view of a piston 10 equipped with a piston head<br>
portion 12 and skirt portion 16 including another embodiment of a tapered volume top<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
8<br>
chamfer 524 in which the width W5 of the top chamfer 524 increases in steps from the<br>
side skirt portions 20 to the middle skirt portion 26.<br>
[0028]	Figure 4A illustrates by way of a fragmentary schematic cross sectional<br>
view, a portion of a top chamfer 224 formed into a portion of the lower wall of the<br>
annular groove in which the oil control ring 36 is received. The chamfer is formed at an<br>
angle , providing an exemplary cross sectional area 50 indicative of the space for the<br>
storage of oil. The top chamfer 224 has a width W1.<br>
[0029]	Figure 4B illustrates by way of a fragmentary schematic cross sectional<br>
view, a portion of a top chamfer 324 formed into a portion of the lower wall of the<br>
annular groove in which the oil control ring 36 is received. The chamfer is formed at a<br>
shallower angle 2 relative to the chamfer angle 1 illustrated in Figure 4A. The<br>
shallower angle 2 provides an increased exemplary cross sectional area 51 indicative of<br>
increased space for storing oil relative to the oil storage area 50 of Figure 4A. The top<br>
chamfer 324 has a width W2 which is wider than W1.<br>
[0030]	Similarly, Figure 4C illustrates a top chamfer 424 formed into a portion of<br>
the wall of the annular groove for the oil control ring 36. The chamfer is formed at the<br>
angle 63. As can be seen in comparing Figures 4A and 4C, the top chamfer 424 of Figure<br>
4C provides a larger volume for storing oil (indicated by the larger exemplary cross<br>
sectional area 52) due to the greater depth of the top chamfer 324 in Figure 4C relative to<br>
the top chamfer 224 shown in Figure 4A. The top chamfer 424 has a width W3 equal to<br>
the width W1 of top chamfer 224 shown in Figure 4A. However, the increased volume<br>
per unit length of the chamfer in Figure 4C is the result solely of the increased depth of<br>
the chamfer formed at angle 83.<br>
[0031]	It should be understood that the tapered areas 24, 224, 324 and 424 are<br>
duplicated on the respective opposite sides of the piston 10.<br>
[0032]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>

annular groove sized and adapted for receiving an oil control ring;<br><br>
GP-309094-PTE-JEK<br>
11<br>
wherein said bevel combines with said oil control ring received in said<br>
annular groove for storing and delivering oil; and<br>
wherein said bevel is sufficiently tapered to preferentially store and deliver<br>
a larger quantity of oil proximate to said middle skirt portion in comparison to a quantity<br>
of oil stored and delivered proximate to said side skirt portions to thereby reduce noise<br>
and friction.<br>
12.	The piston according to claim 11, wherein<br>
a width of said bevel is variable by adjusting an angle of said bevel along<br>
the circumference of said top portion of said skirt, wherein said width varies<br>
circumferentially about said bevel to provide said tapered volume.<br>
13.	A piston having a circumferentially varying chamfer angle in a<br>
circumferential groove to provide a larger volume of oil where needed in the groove for<br>
lubrication.<br><br><br>
Disclosed is a piston having a top chamfer functioning as an oil reservoir,<br>
the top chamfer designed to reduce piston noise and friction. The top chamfer partially<br>
defines a tapered volume or cavity configured to enhance oil flow to the middle portions<br>
of the piston skirt so as to increase lubrication during piston up stroke and thereby reduce<br>
piston noise and friction.<br></td>
