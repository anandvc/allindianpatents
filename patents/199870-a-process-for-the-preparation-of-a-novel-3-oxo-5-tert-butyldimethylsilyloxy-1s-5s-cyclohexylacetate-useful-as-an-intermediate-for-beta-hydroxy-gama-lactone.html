				<td>The present relates to a process for the preparation of a novel 3-oxo-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,5S)-cyclohexylacetate having formula 6<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
useful as an intermediate for 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone for ß-hydroxy -lactone.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel 3-oxo-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,5S)--cyclohexylacetate having formula (6) from 3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexylacetate having formula 5<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound 3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclo-hexylacetate having formula 5 is prepared by a procedure as described and claimed in our co-pending application No.81/Del/2001.<br>
The compound ß-hydroxy δ-lactone is an important intermediate in the synthesis of biologically active drugs e.g. compactin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, cholesterol lowering drugs.<br>
Hitherto known processes for the synthesis of ß-hydroxy-δ-lactone (1) involves<br>
a)	Enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic ß-hydroxy-δ-lactone by transesterification with vinyl acetate in THF using Chromobacteriun viscosum lipase as catalyst at 40°C. [Crosby, J. B.; Andrew, J. H.; John, A. L. WO 9306235 Al CA 119:936292 (1993)]<br>
b)	Chemoenzymatic route involving kinetic resolution through lactone formation in ether catalyzed by PPL [Bonini, C; Pucci, P.; Viggiani, L. J. Org. Chem. 1991,56,4050]<br>
c)	Chemoenzymatic route involving enzymatic desymmetrization of intermediate diacetate, followed by chemical conversions. [Bonni, C; Racioppi, R.; Righi, G.; Viggiani, L. J. Org. Chem. 1991, 58, 802]<br>
The prior art processes have following drawbacks:<br>
1.	The processes use chemicals such as butyl lithium, lithium aluminum hydride, methoxydiethylborane that are costly and difficult to handle and therefore make the process difficult.<br>
2.	All known process are however involves large number of synthetic steps resulting in low over all yields.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel 3-oxo-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(l,S,5S)-cyclohexylacetate useful as an intermediate for 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4S,6R)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone (ß-hydroxy-δ-lactone) (1).<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone (ß-hydroxy δ-lactone) which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art processes and use cheaper and easily accessible chemicals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel 3-oxo-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,5S)-cyclohexylacetate having formula 6<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
useful as an intermediate for ß-hydroxy lactone which comprises extracting<br>
3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexylacetate	having<br>
formula 5 in an organic solvent with chlorochromate of tertiary amines at a temperature ranging from 10-30°C, quenching the above reaction by adding diethyl ether, filtering the mixture through ceilite and washing with brine, removing the solvent by evaporation, followed by fast column filtration to obtain 3-oxo-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,5S)-cyclohexylacetate.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used for the reaction is selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, chloroform and dichloromethane.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below with references to the following examples, which are illustrative only and should not be construed to unit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of cis, cis-3-hydroxy-5-methylcarbonyloxy-cyclohexylacetate 3:<br>
Finely powdered cis, cis-3,5-di(methylcarbonyloxy)cyclohexylacetate 2 (6.5 parts,<br>
25.19 mmol parts) was suspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) (135<br>
parts) and stirred vigorously. To the stirred suspension Porcine Liver Esterase (0.110<br>
parts) was added and reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at 30°C for 20 hr. pH of<br>
the reaction mixture was monitored at every 2 hrs and was maintained at pH 7 using<br>
IN NaOH solution. After completion of reaction (20 hr), it was extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate (2 x 150 parts). Organic layers were combined and washed with brine, dried<br>
on anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to yield cis,cis-3-<br>
hydroxy-5-methylcarbonyloxycyclohexylacetate 3 yield (4.8 g parts, 88%).<br>

and DMAP (0.113 parts, 0.926 mmol) were placed in 100 ml two-necked round<br>
bottom flask equipped with dropping funnel and two-way stopcock. It was evacuated<br>
and flushed with argon. To it, dry dichloromethane (10 parts) and dry HMPA (2 part)<br>

transferred to a separating funnel and washed successively with cold, dil. HC1 water,<br>
aq. NaHCO3 and then brine.   Organic layer was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate<br>
and solvent was removed under vacuum.   Residue was purified by flash column<br>
