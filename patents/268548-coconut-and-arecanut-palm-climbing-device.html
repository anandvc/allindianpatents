				<td>Timely harvesting and other plant protection measures of coconut and arecanut palms become very difficult because of the difficulty in climbing the tree. This remains the biggest problem among coconut and arecanut farmers. A simple coconut and arecanut palm climbing device has been developed by Central Plantation Crops research Institute, kasaragod. It consists of a pair of U shaped frames with a foot rest each at one side of the frames near to the open end. The U shaped frames are laminated with vulcanized rubber to get good grip with the coconut and arecanut tree trunk. Provision is given on the foot rests for the user to fix a pair of shoes of his size and choice. Heel of each shoe is at the open end of the longer arm of the device. Length of the middle arm of the U shaped frame can be altered to suit the size, diameter, of the coconut and arecanut tree trunk.

1.	Title of Invention:	Coconut and Arecanut Palm Climbing Device<br>
2.	Applicant(s)<br>
(a). Name: Indian Council of Agricultural Research (b). Nationality: Indian<br>
(c). Address: Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod, Kerala, India, 671124<br>
3.	The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
This invention relates to a device for climbing coconut and arecanut palms<br>
Prior art<br>
Climbing the palm remains the biggest problem among coconut and arecanut farmers. Traditional coconut and arecanut palm climbers are becoming very rare. Timely harvesting and other plant protection measures become very difficult because of this. Even when available labour charge for climbing operation would be very high. The difficulties in coconut and arecanut palm climbing and the requirement of certain amount of skill and prior experience in that field stops other labourers from this job. Coconut and arecanut climbing devices do exist in the market to help such people. However, because of various reasons like complicated design, high cost, requirement of prior experience etc., none of the devices are popular among the farmers.<br>
It was under these circumstances the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kasaragod developed a coconut and arecanut palm climbing device that is simpler and easy to use than all the existing climbing devices available in the market.<br>
Aracil et al., (2006) presents the promising applications that can be obtained from parallel robots for climbing. It explores the most important aspects of the mechanical design and control of parallel robots based on the Stewart-Goughs platform for tasks in tubular or metallic structure.<br>
  I<br><br>
Joseph invented a palm tree climbing device. It consists of two main iron frames which can be fastened to the opposite sides of the tree trunk by an adjustable belt of wire rope ringing the tree.<br>
Melissa et al. created a device that will climb towering palms to harvest coconuts. The device has a single hexagonal ring that fits around the coconut tree with spring loaded wheels to drive up and down the tree by a remote operator.<br>
Radhakrishnan (2008) described the coconut tree climbing device, which was invented by a 50 year old farmer. The device can be used by any one to climb a tree to pluck nuts, tap the basic ingredients of toddy, the indigenous liquor, or spray insecticides.<br>
Sangeeth (2008) reported a seat type coconut tree climbing device introduced by the Kudappanakunnu Grama Panchayath in Kerala. The climber complete with a Rexene sheet that acts as a perch for the user. The climber is maneuvered up and down using feet locked into the lower frame.<br>
Smith et al. invented a tree trimming device that automatically climb a tree and shears limbs and debris. It comprises an anchor structure comprising a pularility of clamping mechanism to clamp onto a tree. It has got patent on September 2008.<br>
Eliacher and Mizarchi developed a device for climbing up trees and for maintenance of trees having trunks. A power source enables the device to function. (US patent 5301459)<br>
Whittaker and Jeffery developed a magnetic climbing device that consists of a hand unit and leg unit. This device utilizes magnetic substance for scaling ferromagnetic structure. The device has got patent during May 2006.<br>
However the palm climbing device invented by CPCRI differs from the above devices. Major differences are:<br>
•	Moving parts. More number of moving parts in the available devices. Wear and tear and chances of complaints would increase with the increase in number of moving parts. Climbing device developed by CPCRI has no moving parts.<br>
•	Structure. The devices mentioned above have many parts. Their handling also is difficult. But the new one has only two U shaped frames. So it can be handled easily.<br><br>
•	Design. Design of the CPCRI device is much simpler than that of the existing climbing devices. Accordingly fabrication also would be much easier.<br>
•	Cost. Because of simple design material cost and fabrication cost of the CPCRI device would be much less than the available climbing devices.<br>
•	Energy source. Many of the available climbing devices use electrical energy to operate the device. Availability of electricity in coconut and arecanut plantations would be difficult. However, the CPCRI device is manually operated and hence does not require any external energy source.<br>
•	Prime mover. Few of the available climbing devices use electrical motor, electronic parts and other electrical fittings in their climbing machines. However, the CPCRI model does not use any such complicated fittings.<br>
•	Human friendly. In some climbing device there is no provision for human being to go up along with the device. However, in the CPCRI model a man can go up using the device.<br>
•	Easiness to handle. In some of the climbing devices both hands and legs are used together for climbing. The person climbing the tree is totally attached to the machine. If the machine fails there is always a chance for him to fall down. CPCRI model allow the person to hold the tree firmly using his hands, since it requires only legs to operate it.<br>
•	Easiness of attaching. Since CPCRI device has only a pair of U shaped frames, it is very easy to attach it the tree. All the other existing tree/palm climbing devices needs much more time for attaching to the tree. Hence the total time required for transferring the device from one tree to another tree is highly reduced.<br>
•	Stability. Unlike the other existing devices stability of CPCRI device remains same with the weight of the person.<br>
4. Description<br>
The main parts of the coconut and arecanut palm climbing device are two U shaped frames (Figure 1) slightly larger than the tree trunk so that it can move up and down along the tree trunk freely. The frames are laminated using vulcanized rubber to provide good grip with the tree trunk. A foot rest each (Part No.4) is provided at the open end of one arm (Part No.3) of the climbing device. Open end of the other arm (Part No.l) is slightly curved outward for easy insertion of the frame to the coconut or<br><br>
arecanut tree trunk. Provision is g size and choice. Heel of the sho middle arm (Part No.2) can be a arecanut palm. Operation<br>
The user fixes a pair of shoes of his size and choice to each one of the foot rest (Part 1^0.4) on the U shaped frames (Part No.3) for left leg and right leg. This remains fixed to the device till the shoes get damaged due to wear and tear or when another user of different shoe size use the same climbing device. The climbing device can be carried by hand or may be taken by hanging the frames on the user's shoulder, in the same way the coir rope rings or bamboo ladders carried by traditional coconut and arecanut palm climbers. Keeping the climbing device on the ground near the coconut and arecanut palm, the user wears the shoes attached to the frames. The climbing device is now attached to his feet. He then moves his one leg along with the device to the opposite side of the coconut or arecanut tree trunk keeping the device horizontal and inserts the device to it, till the middle arm (Part No.2) touches the tree trunk. Then he pulls the device towards the side of his that leg till the opposite arm (Part No.l) touches the coconut and arecanut tree trunk and applies his body weight on the frame. When he applies his body weight the device tilts towards the side where the weight is being applied. The arm of the device where the foot rest is provided (Part No.3) lowers and the clearance between the coconut and arecanut tree trunk and the device gets reduced at these two opposite sides (Part No.l and Part No.3). At this position the device gets locked to the coconut or arecanut tree trunk. Since the heel of the shoe is at the open end of the frame, the frame bends, lowers, to the side of the coconut or arecanut tree trunk where the climber stands. This tilt towards the climber, towards the open end of the device, prevents the climbing device from detaching the coconut or arecanut tree trunk. At this time all the three arms of the frame of that leg come in to contact with the coconut or arecanut tree trunk and the device gets fixed to it. The climber now stands on this device and fixes the device connected to the other leg at a higher elevation on the tree by repeating the same steps. By repeating these movements he can move up and down the coconut or arecanut palm as easily as he climbs a vertical ladder.<br><br>
