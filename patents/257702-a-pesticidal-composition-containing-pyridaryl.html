The emulsion stability of the pesticidal composition of the invention is demonstrated by the following test example. Test example<br><br>
In water 3.04g of calcium chloride and 1.39g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate were dissolved, and the solution was made up to 100ml with water to prepare a hard water stock. One milliliter of the hard water stock was diluted and made up to 1000ml with water to prepare a test hard water having the water hardness of 34.2ppm.<br>
In a 100-ml graduated cylinder with a stopper 95ml of the above test hard water having the water hardness of 34.2ppm was placed and the graduated cylinder was allowed to stand in a constant temperature water bath at 20°C for a while to adjust the water temperature to 20°C. Then, 5ml of the pesticidal composition of the invention obtained in the above production examples was added to the graduated cylinder, and the graduated cylinder was repeatedly turned upside down 10 times at a rate of once per two seconds. After that, the graduated cylinder was allowed to stand again in the constant temperature water bath at 20°C for one hour. When the state of the emulsion in the graduated cylinder was observed after standing, ECl to EC9 maintained uniform emulsion states and were observed neither creamy separation nor oily separation.<br>
When the same test was conducted by using the Reference ECs, which are disclosed in Formulation Example 1 of WO96/11909 and obtained in the above reference production examples, a small amount of creamy separation and oily separation was observed in case of using Reference ECl and a slight amount of creamy separation was observed in<br>
case of using Reference EC2.<br>
Industrial Applicability The pesticidal composition of the invention is useful for a pesticide for controlling insects and acarina.<br><br>
