AMPHIPHBLIC BLOCK COPOLYMER MICELLE<br>
COMPOSITION CONTAINING TAXANE AND MANU-<br>
FACTURING PROCESS OF THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] Example embodiments of the present invention relate to an amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer micelle composition containing taxane and a process for preparing the<br>
same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] Submicronic particulate drug delivery systems using biodegradable polymers have<br>
been studied for the purpose of carrying out intravenous administration of drugs.<br>
Recently, it has been reported that nanoparticle systems and polymeric micelle systems<br>
using biodegradable polymeis are useful technological systems that can modify the in<br>
vivo distribution of a drug to reduce undesired side effects and can provide improved<br>
efficiency. Additionally, because such systems enable targeted drug delivery, they can<br>
achieve controlled drug release to target organs, tissues or cells. In fact, such systems<br>
are known to have excellent compatibility with body fluids and to improve the solu-<br>
bilization ability of a hardly soluble drug and the bioavailability of a drug.<br>
[3] Recently, there has been reported a method for preparing block copolymer micelles<br>
by chemically bonding a drug to a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic segment<br>
and a hydrophobic segment. The block copolymer is an A-B type diblock copolymer<br>
polymerized from a hydrophilic segment (A) and a hydrophobic segment (B). In the<br>
above-mentioned block copolymer, polyethylene oxide is used as the hydrophilic<br>
segment (A) and a polyaminoacid or hydrophobic group-bonded polyaminoacid is<br>
used as the hydrophobic segment (B). Such drugs as Adriamycin or indomethacin can<br>
be physically encapsulated within the cores of the polymeric micelles formed from the<br>
block copolymer, so that the block copolymer micelles can be used as drug delivery<br>
systems. However, the polymeric micelles formed from the block copolymer cause<br>
many problems in the case of in vivo applications, since they cannot be hydrolyzed in<br>
vivo but are degraded only by enzymes, have poor biocompatibility, and cause immune<br>
responses, or the like.<br>
[4] Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop core-shell type drug delivery<br>
systems having improved biodegradability and biocompatibility.<br>
[5] For example, diblock or multiblock copolymers comprising polyalkylene glycol as a<br>
hydrophilic polymer and polylactic acid as a hydrophobic polymer are known to those<br>
skilled in the art. More particularly, acrylic acid derivatives are bonded to the end<br>
groups of such diblock or multiblock copolymers to form copolymeis. The resultant<br>
copolymers are subjected to crosslinking to stabilize the polymeric micelles. However,<br>
methods for preparing such diblock or multiblock copolymeis have difficulties in in-<br>
troducing croslinkers to the hydrophobic segments of A-B or A-B-A type diblock or<br>
triblock copolymeis for the polymers to form stable structures via croslinking. Ad-<br>
ditionally, the croslinkeis used in the above methods may not ensure safety in the<br>
human body because the crosslinkers have not been applied in the human body as yet.<br>
Furthermore, the croslinked polymeis cannot be degraded in vivo, and thus cannot be<br>
applied for in vivo use.<br>
[6] As another example, a so-called solvent evaporation process has been known as a<br>
method for preparing a polymer micelle composition. The solvent evaporation process<br>
can be applied as a large-scale process by which taxane derivatives, which are hardly<br>
soluble in water, can be encapsulated within amphiphilic block copolymer micelles.<br>
However, utilization of the solvent evaporation process is limited with respect to the<br>
selection of a solvent, because the solvent should be an organic solvent in which both<br>
taxane and the polymer can be dissolved, and should have such a low boiling point that<br>
it can be volatilized via evaporation. In addition, the organic solvent should be a phar-<br>
maceutically acceptable solvent, whose residue does not adversely affect the human<br>
body. Further, the solvent evaporation process essentially includes a step of exposing<br>
reagents to high temperature for a long period of time, and thus it may cause such<br>
problems as degradation of pharmaceutically active ingredients or decreased pharma-<br>
cological effects.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[15] Hereinafter, reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments, examples<br>
of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described below. While the<br>
invention will be described in conjunction with example embodiments, it will be<br>
understood that the present description is not intended to be limitative.<br>
[16] The taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition according<br>
to one embodiment disclosed herein may comprise taxane, an amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer containing a hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic block, and an osmolality<br>
adjusting agent. The taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle<br>
composition has excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, and provides a<br>
polymeric micelle structure having relatively improved stability.<br>
[17] In the composition according to one embodiment disclosed herein, the taxane may be<br>
present in an amount of Q1-30 wt%, and the amphiphilic block copolymer containing<br>
a hydrophilic block and a hydrophobic block may be present in an amount of 20-98<br>
wt%, based on the total dry weight of the micelle composition. Additionally, the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent may be present in an amount of Q1-50 wt% based on the<br>
total dry weight of the composition.<br>
[18] The taxane may be in an anhydrous or hydrated state, or amorphous or crystalline<br>
state. Additionally, the taxane may be extracted from natural plants, or may be<br>
obtained by semi-synthesis or plant cell cultivation. In one embodiment, the taxane<br>
may be present in the composition in an amount of Q1-30 wt%, specifically Q5-15<br>
wt%, and more specifically 1-7 wt% based on the total dry weight of the composition.<br>
[19] In one embodiment, the taxane includes paclitaxel, docetaxel, 7-epipaclitaxel, t -<br>
acetyl paclitaxel, 10-desacetyl-paclitaxel, 10-desacetyl-7-epipaclitaxel,<br>
7-xylosylpaclitaxel, 10-desacetyl-7-glutarylpaclitaxel, 7-N,N-dimethylglycylpaclitaxel,<br>
7-L-alanylpaclitaxel or a mixture thereof. Particularly, paclitaxel or docetaxel may be<br>
used.<br>
[20] In one embodiment, the amphiphilic block copolymer may comprise a hydrophilic<br>
block (A) and a hydrophobic block (B) linked with each other in the form of A-B, A-<br>
B-A or B-A-B structure. Additionally, the amphiphilic block copolymer may form<br>
core-shell type polymeric micelles in its aqueous solution state, wherein the hy-<br>
drophobic block forms the core and the hydrophilic block forms the shell.<br>
[21] In one embodiment, the hydrophilic block (A) of the amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
may be polyethylene glycol (PEG) or monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). Par-<br>
ticularly, it may be mPEG. The hydrophilic block (A) may have anumber average<br>
molecular weight of 500-20,000 daltons, specifically 1,000-5,000 daltons, and more<br>
specifically 1,000-2,500 daltons.<br>
[22] The hydrophobic block (B) of the amphiphilic block copolymer may be a water-<br>
insoluble, biodegradable polymer. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic block (B) may<br>
be polylactic acid (PLA) or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). In another<br>
embodiment; the hydrophobic block (B) may-have anumberaverage molecular weight<br>
of 500-20,000 daltons, specifically 1,000-5,000 daltons, and more specifically<br>
1,000-2,500 daltons. Hydroxyl end groups of the hydrophobic block (B) may be<br>
protected with fatty acid groups, and particular examples of the fatty acid groups<br>
include acetate, propionate, butyrate, stearate, palmitate groups, and the like. The am-<br>
phiphilic block copolymer comprising the hydrophilic block (A) and the hydrophobic<br>
block (B) may be present in the composition in an amount of 20-98 wt%, specifically<br>
65-98 wt%, and more specifically 80-98 wt% based on the total dry weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
[23] In another embodiment, the hydrophilic block (A) and the hydrophobic block (B)<br>
may be present in the amphophilic block copolymer in such a ratio that the copolymer<br>
comprises 40-70 wt%, specifically 50-60 wt% of the hydrophilic block (A) based on<br>
the weight of the copolymer. When the hydrophilic block (A) is present in a proportion<br>
less than 40%, the polymer has undesirably low solubility to water, resulting in<br>
difficulty in forming micelles. On the other hand, when the hydrophilic block (A) is<br>
present in a proportion greater than 70%, the polymer becomes too hydrophilic to form<br>
stable polymeric micelles, and thus the composition may not be used as a composition<br>
for solubilizing taxane.<br>
[24] The osmolality adjusting agent functions to improve the stability of the taxane-<br>
containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition. Particularly, the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent significantly improves the stability of the composition in its<br>
aqueous solution state. One possible mechanism of the function of the osmolality<br>
adjusting agent is as follows.<br>
[25] The degree of encapsulation of a drug within a polymeric micelle structure is in<br>
proportion to the fraction of cores formed from the hydrophobic block of the polymer<br>
in an aqueous solution. Additionally, the stability of the polymeric micelles depends on<br>
the dynamic equilibrium state formed by the polymeric micelles in an aqueous<br>
solution, i.e., on the equilibrium constant between the polymeric micelle state and the<br>
unimer state dissolved in water.<br>
[26] Although a large amount of poorly soluble drug can be encapsulated within a<br>
polymeric micelle structure, the hydrophilic blocks of the polymer micelles may be<br>
surrounded with a great amount of water molecules upon the encapsulation of the drug,<br>
and thus the interaction between the water molecules and the hydrophilic blocks may<br>
weaken the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic blocks of the micelles,<br>
thereby destabilizing the micelles in a dynamic equilibrium state. Addition of the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent causes an electrostatic attraction force between the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent and water, resulting in dissociation of water molecules from<br>
the hydrophilic blocks of the polymeric micelles. As a result, the hydrophobic in-<br>
teraction between the hydrophobic blocks, which otherwise would participate in loose<br>
interaction, increases relatively, so that stable micelle structures can be formed. In<br>
addition, the osmolality adjusting agent is not removed during the preparation of the<br>
composition according to one embodiment disclosed herein but remains in the finished<br>
composition. Through the stabilization effect realized by the osmolality adjusting<br>
agent, the taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition has<br>
excellent stability.<br>
[27] The osmolality adjusting agent is pharmaceutically acceptable one and may be<br>
selected from any osmolality adjusting agents as long as it does not cause hemolysis<br>
upon the contact with blood. In one embodiment, the osmolality adjusting agent may<br>
be an electrolyte, specifically an inorganic salt. Preferably, the osmolality adjusting<br>
agent may be at least one selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride,<br>
calcium chloride, sodium sulfate and magnesium chloride. More particularly, the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent may be sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Especially, it<br>
may be sodium chloride. In another embodiment, the osmolality adjusting agent may<br>
be present in the composition in an amount of 0.1-50 wt%, specifically 0.5-20 wt%,<br>
and more specifically 1-10 wt%, based on the total dry weight of the composition.<br>
[28] In another aspect, there is provided a lyophilized composition comprising the taxane-<br>
containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition.<br>
[29] The lyophilized composition may further comprise a lyophilization aid. In one<br>
embodiment, the lyophilization aid may be at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of lactose, mannitol, sorbitol and sucrose. The lyophilization aid is added<br>
for the lyophilized composition to maintain a cake form. In addition, the lyophilization<br>
aid serves to help the amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition to form homo-<br>
geneously in short time during the reconstitution of the lyophilized composition. In<br>
another embodiment, the lyophilization aid may be used in an amount of 1-90 wt%,<br>
and more particularly 10-60 wt%, based on the total dry weight of the lyophilized<br>
composition.<br>
[30] In one embodiment, the lyophilized composition may comprise 0.1-15 wt% of taxane<br>
based on the total dry weight of the composition, upon the reconstitution in an aqueous<br>
solution. Additionally, upon the reconstitution, the amphiphilic block copolymer may<br>
be present at a concentration of 10-150 mg/mL, the osmolality adjusting agent may be<br>
present at a concentration of 5-30 mg/mL (specifically, 10-20 mg/mL), and the<br>
lyophilization aid may be present at a concentration of 1-100 mg/mL. In another<br>
embodiment, the lyophilized composition can have a controlled micelle particle size in<br>
a range of 1-400 nm, and more particularly 5-200 nm in an aqueous solution,<br>
depending on the molecular weight of the copolymer.<br>
[31] In one embodiment, the taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle<br>
composition may be formulated into the form of an aqueous solution, powder or tablet.<br>
In another embodiment, the composition may be an injection formulation. For<br>
example, the composition may be reconstituted with distilled water for injection, 0.9%<br>
physiological saline, 5% aqueous dextrose solution, and the like. When the<br>
composition is reconstituted, at least 95% of taxane is stable for 12 hours or more<br>
without precipitation.<br>
[32] In still another aspect, there is provided a method for preparing the taxane-containing<br>
amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition.<br>
[33] According to one embodiment disclosed herein, the method for preparing the taxane-<br>
containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition may comprise:<br>
[34] (a) dissolving taxane and an amphiphilic block copolymer into an organic solvent;<br>
and<br>
[35] (b) adding an aqueous solution containing an osmolality adjusting agent thereto to<br>
form polymeric micelles.<br>
[36] In another embodiment, the method may further comprise, after step (b):<br>
[37] (c) adding a lyophilization aid to the polymeric micelles; and<br>
[38] (d) carrying out lyophilization.<br>
[39] When taxane is encapsulated with a micelle composition by using an organic solvent<br>
via a solvent evaporation process, rapid drug precipitation may occur in the taxane-<br>
containing micelle composition after the composition is reconstituted in injection water<br>
and is left at room temperature. This is because the organic solvent used in the solvent<br>
evaporation process remains in the composition.<br>
[40] Therefore, according to one embodiment of the method disclosed herein, drug pre-<br>
cipitation may be prevented by using an osmolality adjusting agent and a minimized<br>
amount of organic solvent. To minimize the amount of the organic solvent still<br>
remaining in the finished composition, the composition needs to be dried at a high<br>
temperature of 6CPC or higher under reduced pressure for at least 12 houis. However,<br>
such reduced-pressure, high-temperature drying conditions may cause degradation of a<br>
drug. Thus, the method for preparing the taxane-containing amphiphilic block<br>
copolymer micelle composition according to one embodiment disclosed herein uses a<br>
minimized amount of organic solvent so that the finished composition can be directly<br>
subjected to lyophilization while avoiding a need for a separate step of removing the<br>
organic solvent.<br>
[41] The taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition containing<br>
the osmolality adjusting agent and using a minimized amount of organic solvent<br>
according to one embodiment disclosed herein can provide a lyophilized composition<br>
which is free from precipitation of taxane for 12 hoius or more when reconstituted into<br>
an injection formulation.<br>
[42] In one embodiment, the organic solvent in step (a) may include at least one selected<br>
from the group consisting of acetone, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile,<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform, acetic acid and dioxane. The organic solvent may be<br>
used in an amount of 0.5-30 wt%, specifically 0.5-15 wt%, and more specifically 1-10<br>
wt% based on the weight of the resultant micelle composition. When the organic<br>
solvent is used in an amount less than 0.5 wt%, there may be a difficulty in dissolving<br>
a drug. On the other hand, when the organic solvent is used in an amount greater than<br>
30 wt%, drug precipitation may occur upon the reconstitution of the lyophilized<br>
composition.<br>
[43] In step (b), the osmolality of the aqueous solution containing the osmolality adjusting<br>
agent may be adjusted to 30-15,000 mOsm/kg, specifically 100-5,000 mOsm/kg, and<br>
more specifically 200-2,590 mOsm/kg. When the osmolality of the aqueous solution is<br>
less than 30 mOsm/kg, drug precipitation may occur during the preparation of the<br>
composition. On the other hand, when the osmolality is greater than 15,000 mOsm/kg,<br>
phase separation may occur in the polymer. In one example embodiment, the<br>
osmolality adjusting agent may be at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium sulfate and magnesium chloride. In<br>
addition, the osmolality adjusting agent may be used in an amount of 0.1-50 wt%<br>
based on the total dry weight of the micelle composition. Step (b) may be performed at<br>
a temperature of 25°C or lower.<br>
[44] In one embodiment, the method for preparing the taxane-containing amphiphilic<br>
block copolymer micelle composition may further comprise sterilizing the aqueous<br>
polymeric micelle solution obtained from step (c) with a sterilization filter, before step<br>
(d) of carrying out lyophilization.<br>
[45] The taxane-containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelle composition according<br>
to one embodiment disclosed herein may be orally or parenterally administered in the<br>
form of an aqueous solution or powder. Parenteral administration includes admin-<br>
istration via intravascular, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, nasal, rectal,<br>
ophthalmic, pulmonary or other routes. Oral administration includes administration in<br>
the form of tablets or capsules, or aqueous solution itself.<br>
[46] In addition, the lyophilized composition according to one embodiment disclosed<br>
herein causes little variation in the concentration of docetaxel in a reconstituted<br>
composition over time. However, when no osmolality adjusting agent is added,<br>
docetaxel concentration decreases after the lapse of one hour.<br>
[47]<br>
[48] The following examples are not intended to be limitative.<br>
[49]<br>
[50] Preparation Example 1: Synthesis of Monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-Polylactide<br>
(mPEG-PLA) Block Copolymer (A-B Type)<br>
[51] First, 5.0 g of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (number average molecular weight:<br>
2,000 daltons) was introduced into a 100 mL two-neck round-bottom flask, and was<br>
heated to 13CPC under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 3-4 houis to remove water<br>
therefrom. Next, the flask was purged with nitrogen gas, and stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)<br>
) was added thereto as a reaction catalyst using a syringe in an amount of 0.1 wt%<br>
(10.13 mg, 25 mmol) based on the weight of d- and 1-lactides. After the reaction<br>
mixture was agitated for 30 minutes, it was subjected to depressurization (1 mmHg) at<br>
130oC for 1 hour to remove the solvent (toluene) in which the catalyst was dissolved.<br>
Then, 10.13 g of purified lactide was added thereto, and the resultant mixture was<br>
heated at 130oC for 18 houis. After heating, the resultant polymer was dissolved into<br>
methylene chloride, and was added to diethyl ether to cause precipitation of the<br>
polymer. The resultant polymer was dried in a vacuum oven for 48 houis.<br>
[52] The copolymer, monomethoxylpolyethylene glycol-polylactide (mPEG-PLA), had a<br>
number average molecular weight of 2,000-1,765 daltons. Analysis of the copolymer<br>
performed by H-NMR revealed that the copolymer was an A-B type diblock<br>
copolymer (see Fig. 1).<br>

Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA) Block Copolymer (A-B Type)<br>
[55] A block copolymer was obtained by reacting monomethoxypolyethylene glycol<br>
(number average molecular weight: 5,000 daltons), lactide and glycolide in the<br>
presence of stannous octoate as a catalyst at 12CPC for 12 houis in the same manner as<br>
Preparation Example 1.<br>
[56] The copolymer, monomethoxypolyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)<br>
(mPEG-PLGA), had a number average molecular weight of 5,000-4,000 daltons and<br>
was an A-B type copolymer. Analysis of the copolymer performed by 1H-NMR<br>
revealed that the copolymer was an A-B type diblock copolymer (see Fig. 2).<br>
[57]<br>
[58] Example 1: Preparation of mPEG-PLA Block Copolymer Micelle Composition<br>
Containing Sodium Chloride and Docetaxel<br>
[59] First, 760 mg of the amphiphilic block copolymer, mPEG-PLA (number average<br>
molecular weight: 2,000-1,765 daltons), obtained from Preparation Example 1 was<br>
completely dissolved into 0.2 mL of ethanol at 6CPC to provide a clear ethanol solution<br>
comprising the copolymer. The ethanol solution was cooled to 25°C, and 20 mg of<br>
docetaxel was added thereto and the resultant solution was agitated until docetaxel was<br>
completely dissolved.<br>
[60] Next, aqueous solutions each containing 0.9 wt% and 1.8 wt% of sodium chloride<br>
and having an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg and 600 mOsm/kg were prepared in<br>
separate containers. The osmolality was measured by using a commercially available<br>
osmometer (Gonotech GmbH, OSMOMAT030). Each aqueous solution was added to<br>
the ethanol solution comprising the copolymer in an amount of 4 mL, and the resultant<br>
mixture was agitated at 4CPC for 10 minutes to form an aqueous polymeric micelle<br>
solution.<br>
[61] Then, 100 mg of d-mannitol was dissolved into each solution, and the resultant<br>
solution was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm to remove undissolved<br>
docetaxel, followed by lyophilization.<br>
[62] The lyophilized composition was subjected to liquid chromatography as follows to<br>
determine the content of docetaxel. Additionally, particle size was measured by a<br>
dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. The results are shown in the following Table<br>

[73] First, 100 mg of the amphiphilic block copolymer, mPEG-PLA (number average<br>
molecular weight: 2,000-1,765 daltons), obtained from Preparation Example 1 was<br>
completely dissolved into 0.1 mL of ethanol at 6CPC to provide a clear ethanol solution<br>
comprising the copolymer. The ethanol solution was cooled to 25°C, and 20 mg of<br>
paclitaxel was added thereto and the resultant solution was agitated until paclitaxel was<br>
completely dissolved.<br>
[74] Next, aqueous solutions each containing 0.9 wt% and 1.8 wt% of calcium chloride<br>
and having an osmolality of 230 mOsm/kg and 460 mOsm/kg were prepared in<br>
separate containers. Each aqueous solution was added to the ethanol solution<br>
comprising the copolymer in an amount of 4 mL, and the resultant mixture was<br>
agitated at 4CPC for 10 minutes to form an aqueous polymeric micelle solution.<br>
[75] Then, 39 mg of d-mannitol was dissolved into each solution, and the resultant<br>
solution was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm to remove undissolved<br>
paclitaxel, followed by lyophilization.<br>

solution comprising the copolymer. The acetone solution was cooled to 25°C, and 40<br>
mg of docetaxel was added thereto and the resultant solution was agitated until<br>
docetaxel was completely dissolved.<br>
[81] Next, 8 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.9 wt% of sodium chloride and<br>
having an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg was added to the acetone solution comprising<br>
the copolymer and further containing the drug, and the resultant mixture was agitated<br>
at 25°C for 20 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Once the homogeneous<br>
solution was formed, 200 mg of d-mannitol was dissolved into the solution to provide<br>
a clear aqueous polymeric micelle solution. Finally, the aqueous polymeric micelle<br>
solution was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm to remove undissolved<br>
docetaxel, followed by lyophilization.<br>

paclitaxel was completely dissolved.<br>
[88] Next, 8 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.9 wt% of calcium chloride and<br>
having an osmolality of 230 mOsm/kg was added to the acetone solution comprising<br>
the copolymer and further containing the drug, and the resultant mixture was agitated<br>
at 25°C for 20 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Once the homogeneous<br>
solution was formed, 53 mg of d-mannitol was dissolved into the solution to provide a<br>
clear aqueous polymeric micelle solution. Finally, the aqueous polymeric micelle<br>
solution was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm to remove undissolved<br>
paclitaxel, followed by lyophilization.<br>
[89] The lyophilized composition was subjected to high-performance liquid chro-<br>
matography (HPLC) to determine the content of docetaxel. Additionally, particle size<br>

[93] Comparative Example 1: Preparation of mPEG-PLA Block Copolymer Micelle<br>
Composition Containing No Inorganic Salt<br>
[94] First, 760 mg of the amphiphilic block copolymer, mPEG-PLA (number average<br>
molecular weight: 2,000-1,765 daltons), obtained from Preparation Example 1 was<br>
completely dissolved into 0.2 mL of ethanol at 60oC to provide a clear ethanol solution<br>
comprising the copolymer. The ethanol solution was cooled to 25°C, and 20 mg of<br>
docetaxel was added thereto and the resultant solution was agitated until docetaxel was<br>
completely disolved.<br>
[95] Next, 4 mL of distilled water for injection (osmolality: 0 mOsm/kg) was added to the<br>
ethanol solution comprising the copolymer, and the resultant mixture was agitated at<br>
40°C for 10 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Once the homogeneous solution<br>
was formed, 100 mg of d-mannitol was disolved into the solution to provide a clear<br>
aqueous polymeric micelle solution. Finally, the aqueous polymeric micelle solution<br>
was filtered through a filter with a pore size of 200 nm to remove undissolved<br>
docetaxel, followed by lyophilization.<br>
[96] The lyophilized composition was subjected to HPLC to determine the content of<br>
docetaxel. Additionally, particle size was measured by a DLS method.<br>
[97] Docetaxel content: 100.3 wt%.<br>
[98] Particle size: 18 nm.<br>
[99]<br>
[100] Experimental Example 1: Stability Test<br>
[101] The sodium chloride-containing polymeric micelle compositions according to<br>
Example 1 were compared with the polymeric micelle composition containing no<br>
inorganic salt according to Comparative Example 1 in terms of the stability of the<br>
aqueous solution at 37°C.<br>
[102] Each of the lyophilized compositions according to Example 1 and Comparative<br>
Example 1 was diluted with distilled water for injection to a docetaxel concentration of<br>
1 mg/mL. While each diluted solution was left at 37°C, concentration of docetaxel<br>
contained in each micelle structure was measured over time. The results are shown in<br>
the following Table 3.<br>
[103] [Table 3]<br>
[104] <br>
[105] As can be seen from the results of Table 3, the compositions according to Example 1<br>
cause no precipitation of docetaxel even after the lapse of 12 hous, while the<br>
composition according to Comparative Example 1 shows an amount of docetaxel pre-<br>
cipitation of 59% after the lapse of 12 hours. It can be seen from the above results that<br>
addition of sodium chloride may increase the docetaxel retainability of a micelle<br>
composition by about at least two times. Additionally, it can be also seen that a higher<br>
ratio of the amount of the inorganic salt to that of the amphiphilic block copolymer<br>
provides the micelle competition with higher stability.<br>
