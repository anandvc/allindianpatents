[Experimental example 1: Test for sterilizing microorganisms]<br>
The microorganisms used for the sterilization test were Escherichia coli DH12S, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 1621 and Candida albicans KCTC 7965,<br>
which are known as pathogenic microorganisms. An UV/03 lamp (184.9nm) was used as the generator for generating ultraviolet rays and ozone.<br>
Each of the microorganisms was cultivated  on  appropriate culture medium used commonly: Escherichia coli was cultivated on LB culture medium; Staphylococcus aureus was cultivated on Tryptic Soy culture medium; and Candida albicans was cultivated on YM culture medium. A sample of the microorganism was prepared as follows: After each of the microorganisms was cultivated on agar culture medium, one colony was taken. And then the colony was inoculated into broths of 5 ml, which was cultivated for two hours. The sample prepared as mentioned above was kept in cold storage for the following use. The broths used for cultivation were diluted gradually from an undiluted solution to 10-8, and then they were painted over the agar culture medium. One control was obtained from each of the diluted samples, and seven samples for test were obtained from each of the diluted samples. The control and samples were subject to pre-incubation in the incubator with the temperature of 37"C for 30 minutes, which was used for sterilization test.<br>
The concentration of the ozone in the sterilizing and disinfecting room reached 50 ppm within two or three minutes. And the concentration of the ozone was adjusted so that it was maintained to 70 ppm.<br>
The humidity was maintained to 50% The agar culture medium was placed on several position where it was not exposed to the ultraviolet rays and it had good ventilation. One agar culture medium corresponding to the bedclothes as a test sample was taken every ten minutes after the generator for generating the ultraviolet rays and the ozone was operated. The agar culture medium was cultivated together with the control sample in the incubator with the<br>
temperature of 37'C for 48 hours. And then the culture medium diluted such that it had a appropriate number of the colony to check the number of the microorganisms, from which the number of the colony was counted. The number of the real microorganisms and the number of the surviving microorganisms were added together taking the number of the colony and the dilution rate of each sample into account. The test as mentioned above was repeated three times for the purpose of obtaining the statistical effectiveness. The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 7. [Table 1: Number of surviving microorganisms in ozone of 70 ppm]<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[Experimental example 2'- Test for killing mites]<br>
Mites used for test was the house dust mites (samples containing Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pterohyssinus and Tyrophagus putrescentiae mixed up one another were used) which were generally known as primary cause of allergy, which was distributed from the parasitology class of the medical college of Yonsei University in Korea. After the opening the lid of the tube containing twenty mites, the mites were exposed to the environment with the ozone of 50 ppm and the humidity of 72% for 2 hours while the mites were not exposed directly to the ultraviolet rays. After exposition of the mites to the ozone for a given time period, the number of the surviving mites and the number of the dead mites were counted by means of a microscopic examination. The<br>
examination revealed that most of the mites (for example, seventeen mites) were killed. Especially, all of the young mites were killed, and a few surviving large mites were not able to be active normally, which were dead as times went by.<br>
