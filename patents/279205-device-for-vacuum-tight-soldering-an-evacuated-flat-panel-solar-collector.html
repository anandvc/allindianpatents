TITLE<br>
Device for vacuum tight soldering an evacuated flat panel solar collector<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for vacuum tight soldering a perimeter<br>
metal coating of a transparent wall to a  perimeter metal frame of a holding<br>
structure   of   an   evacuated   flat   panel   solar   collector,    according   to   the<br>
precharacterising portion of claim 1.<br>
Such an evacuated flat panel solar collector is known in the art and Is described<br>
in WO2005/075900.<br>
One of the main problems in the fabrication of the known evacuated flat panel<br>
solar collectors is soldering together in a vacuum tight way the perimeter metal<br>
coating of the transparent wall of the solar collector to the corresponding<br>
perimeter metal frame of the holding structure of said solar collector.<br>
Up to now it is known to perform said soldering only manually. This way of<br>
soldering is rather time consuming as a skilled worker is able to produce only<br>
up to about 40 square meters of double glazed solar panel collectors a day.<br>
An object of the invention Is to provide a device which minimizes the duration<br>
of the soldering operation and which is at the same time able to perform said<br>
soldering rapidly and In an accurate/reproducible way, without the need of<br>
manual intervention, thus reducing the fabrication cost of these solar collectors<br>
and their reliability as far as vacuum tightness is concerned.<br>
This and other objects which will be apparent to an expert in the field are<br>
attained  by a device in  accordance with the characterising portion  of the<br>
accompanying claims.<br>
The invention is better illustrated by the accompanying drawings, which are<br>
provided by way of non-limiting example and on which:<br>
Figure 1 Is a simplified perspective view of a device according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a simplified partial sectional view of figure 1  of a soldered solar<br>
 <br>
collector.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are simplified partial sectional views of figure 1 with the soldering device in two different operative positions.<br>
The figures 1 and 2 show an evacuated flat panel solar collector 1 comprising: a holding structure 2, made of metal, provided with a perimeter upper metal frame 3 for holding and supporting a transparent upper transparent wail 4, preferably a glass wall, provided all along its perimeter with a metal coating 5, and a joining ribbon, preferably a soft metal strip or ribbon 6, in particular a lead and/or copper strip or ribbon, for vacuum tight sealing the gap 7 between the first transparent wall 4 and the metal frame 2. This soft metal ribbon 6 is soldered, in particular soft soldered, to said perimeter metal frame 3 and said perimeter metal coating 5 of the transparent wall 4.<br>
As shown in figure 2 preferably the upper metal frame 3 comprises: an upper flat surface 14 and a step 15 departing from an inner border of said surface 14. Said step 15 forming a seat 16 for the lower border 17 of the transparent wall 4, and a support bar 18 connecting this step 15 to a bottom part (not shown) of the holding structure. The step 15 is dimensioned in such a way that the upper perimeter metal coating 5 of the transparent wall remains substantially coplanar with the upper surface 14 of the metal frame 3 while the gap 7 between the transparent wall 4 and the metal frame 2 is a few millimetres wide. An evacuated flat panel solar collector as described above is known in the art and is described for example in WO2005/075900. Therefore this collector as well as its other components will not be further described in detail. The soldering device according to the Invention comprises a movable heating and pressing frame 8 hinged in 9 to a support structure 10, and means 11 and 12 for automatically moving this heating and pressing frame 8 from a first operative position M in which this frame 8 does not interfere with the collector 1, a second operative position N (figure 3) in which the complete frame 3 is<br>
 <br>
positioned over the collector, and a third operative position P (figure 4) in which only a part of the frame 3 exerts pressure on the collector.<br>
The support structure 10 comprises a support platform 21 featuring a hollow seat 20 having the same shape and dimensions as the lower part of the holding structure 2 of the collector 1 for firmly holding in a predetermined position the collector during the soldering operations. The support platform 21 also comprises means, for example holes 22 for bolts (not shown) for connecting it to a further support structure (not shown). The support structure at its rear side comprises upstanding flanges 23 for hinging the ends of two arms 19 departing from the heating and pressing frame 8. The heating and pressing frame 8 comprises two separate and overlapping frames having the same lateral dimensions: a first upper heating frame 24 and a second lower pressing frame 25. These two frames are hinged to the flanges 23 independently in such a way that: the pressing frame 25 may be rotated over the collector 1 before or at the same time as the heating frame 24 and, on the other hand, the heating frame 24 may be rotated away from the collector before the pressure 25 frame is moved in the same way or together with said pressing frame. These two frames are shaped and dimensioned in such a way as to completely cover at least the soft metal ribbon 6 provided on the perimeter metal coated part 5 of the transparent wall 4 and on the perimeter metal frame part 3 of the holding structure 1, and preferably also a first part 5A (figure 2) of the transparent wall 4 comprising at least the perimeter metal coating 5, and a second part: 3A of the holding structure 2 comprising at least part of the metal frame 3, and the soft metal ribbon 6.<br>
Advantageously, the heating frame 24 Is separated into two elements: an outer heating frame element 26 for heating only the metal frame part 3 of the holding structure 1 and the corresponding joining ribbon portion provided on that metal frame part, and an inner heating frame element 27 for heating only the metal<br>
 <br>
coated part 5 of the transparent wall 4 and the corresponding joining ribbon portion provided on said metal coating. Advantageously, these two elements 26, 27 are separated by a thermal insulating element 28 such as for example a ceramic, glass fibre or organic polymer element, and are connected to different well-known heating means 29, 30, for example electrical heating means. These different heating means 29, 30 allow two different temperatures to be chosen for soldering of the soft metal ribbon 6 to the metal coating 5 of the glass wall 4 and to the metal frame 3, in view of the different thermal properties of these materials. This thermal insulation in the heating frame 24 guarantees a rapid and efficient soldering process while saving energy as the metal coating of the glass wall needs to be heated less than the metal frame of the holding structure.<br>
The pressing frame 25 is also divided In two parts by the thermal insulating element 28, because such frame is realized in a thermal conductive material, preferably a metallic material, which is able to transfer the thermal energy from the heating frame 24 to the collector parts 14, 6, 5, 4 the lower surface 25A of the pressing frame 25 is in contact with. The pressing frame 25 may comprise inner cooling means 31, for example channels for the flow of a cooling fluid, fed to the device through a cooling tube 32 and cooling means 33. The means 11, 12 for automatically moving between their operating positions M, N, P the heating and the pressing frames 24, 25 are for example a hydraulic 0 mechanical jack, but any known suitable moving means may be used. These moving means 11, 12 enable a rapid and efficient movement of the frames in their operative positions and guarantee that when only the pressing frame 25 is in its lower position P (figure 4) a sufficient pressure Is exerted on the already melted soldering alloy layer so that a reliable soldering can take place. The use of a device according to the invention is as follows. A glass wall 4 is positioned in the collector holding structure seat 16 so as to present its metal<br>
 <br>
coated perimeter 5 coplanar with the flat edge 14 of the holding structure metal frame 3, which advantageously was previously tin or lead-tin alloy coated. The resulting gap 7 between the transparent wall 4 and the metal frame 2 is then covered by a joining ribbon, such as a soft metal strip or ribbon 6, also preferably tin coated, eventually interposing a thin layer of soldering alloy. The joining ribbon is then heated by lowering over said soft metal strip or ribbon 6 the heating and pressing frame 8 and by activating the heating means 29, 30 of the heating frame 24 which are kept at the required temperature until the tin and or the lead-tin covering the soft metal strip or ribbon 6 and the flat edge 14 of the holding structure metal frame 3 is melted eventually intermixing with the interposed soldering alloy layer. The typical duration of the melting process will be of the order of 30 seconds, with the temperature of the heating frame 24 ranging between 200 °C and 300 oc depending on the actual geometry and heat capacity of the glass wall 4 and metal frame 2. Then the heating frame 24 is lifted In its position M (figure 1) no longer interfering with the collector and only the pressing frame 25 is maintained over the collector. At the same time this pressing frame is slightly cooled below the soldering alloy melting point by activating the cooling means 31 provided in the pressing frame 25. In order to guarantee a vacuum tight soldering, said pressing frame 25 should exert over the joining ribbon a pressure sufficient to keep the surfaces of the soft metal strip or ribbon 6, the metal coated perimeter 5 of the glass wall 4 and the flat edge 14 of the holding structure metal frame 3 in good mechanical contact throughout the solidification process of the soldering alloy. The typical duration of the solidification process will be of the order of 30 seconds, with the force applied by the lower pressing frame 25 ranging between 10 Kg and 20 Kg per linear meter of the joining ribbon.<br>
Finally, when the entire soldering process is completed, also the pressing frame 25 is lifted so as to allow the soldered collector 1 to be moved out and replaced<br>
 <br>
by the next coliector.<br>
The device according to the invention aliows the soldering operation to be carried out very quickly without the need of sl<iiled workers allowing the soldering of a few hundred square meters evacuated panels day with single automatic assembly fine.></iiled>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in the drawings and in the above description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only a preferred embodiment has.been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the scope of the invention are desired to be protected. For example the solar collector could comprise a second transparent wall parallel to the wall 4 previously described and forming the bottom wall of the collector holding structure which according to this embodiment of the invention has a framed shape. The positioning and/or the shape of the joining ribbon as well as the shape and/or positioning of the metal coated layer of the glass wall as well as that of the metal frame part to be soldered may be different from that described above and may be any of the known variants, for example described in WO 2005/075900, in that case the heating and pressing frame would be modified accordingly in their shape in a way obvious to an expert in the field having the knowledge of the invention previously described.<br>
