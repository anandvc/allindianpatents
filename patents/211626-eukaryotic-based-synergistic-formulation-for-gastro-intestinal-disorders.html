This invention relates to Eukaryotic Based Synergistic Formulation for Gastro-Intestinal Disorders.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
Particularly the invention'provides a formulation that regulates the balance of microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. More particularly, the present invention provides a eukaryotic based probiotic formulation with more stability. Still more particularly, the formulation of the present invention provides a formulation, which reduces if not prevents the ill effects of the harmful organisms.<br>
Yet more particularly, the formulation of the present invention stimulates the growth of probiotics and inhibits the growth of undesired harmful microbes. Further, the formulation also takes care of secondary ill effects induced through ingestion or administration of pharmaceuticals or physiological components, to which the gut-micro-flora is associated.<br>
BACKGROUND IF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is a known fact that the human body consists of about 10 trillion cells, but it is the home to 10 times as many bacterial cells as human cells. Indeed, about 100 trillion bacterial cells, from more than 500 different species, reside in the human gut, lungs, and skin. Some of these organisms can cause disease while most are beneficial. These '*good microbes" help defend the body against disease-causing microbes by a variety of physiological mechanisms.<br>
The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) is a complex micro-ecosystem, in which the mucosal lining hosts billions of microorganisms that live attached to it. Imbalance of this ecosystem results in gastro intestinal disorders. Probiotics or life promoting, are a class of microorganisms defined as live microbial organisms that beneficially affect the<br><br>
animal and human hosts. Some of the probiotics are of transient nature and are introduced through food or food supplement. The probiotics, inhabitant of the mucosal membrane, reproduce in the digestive tract thereby improving the microbial balance of the intestinal microflora or improving the properties of the indigenous microflora. The beneficial effects of probiotics may be mediated by a direct antagonistic effect against specific groups of organisms resulting in a decrease in numbers, by an effect on their metabolism or by stimulation of immunity. Probiotics also suppress viable counts of an undesired organism by producing antibacterial compounds, by competing for nutrients or for adhesion sites. Further, they may alter microbial metabolism by increasing or decreasing enzyme activity or they may stimulate the immune system by increasing antibody levels or increasing macrophage activity.<br>
The beneficial micro organisms can produce substances, such as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and potent antibiotic compounds called bacteriocins, that inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi. They also compete with disease-causing microbes for nutrients and space, thus hindering overgrowth of the bad bugs. Beneficial organisms also secrete enzymes that aid digestion and produce substances that raise intestinal acidity, thereby promoting the absorption of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. These probiotics boost immune function, reduce food allergies, and prevent certain infections. Preliminary studies suggest certain good bacteria may also have cholesterol-lowering and anticancer properties. Probiotics also appear to stem from their effects on the lymphoid tissue in the gut.<br>
Regular ingestion of probiotic bacteria actually modifies both immune-enhancing and immune-suppressing cells in the gut, which helps modulate the immune response. Thus,<br><br>
probiotics can heighten the body's response to viruses, while decreasing the response to certain antigens, such as those responsible for food allergies." Proper balancing of probiotics is very important. According to researchers in Europe the imbalance of this micro-flora is responsible for as much as 80% of degenerative diseases. Without understanding the actual role played by probiotics, the lactic acid producing probiotics are in use for processing food and beverages over 4000 years. Traditionally, the balance is partly maintained by ingesting food containing these organisms. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on probiotics in past decades. The benefits of probiotic are well documented but are not evidenced adequately. It is well known that administration of certain drugs including antibiotics results in reducing the micro-flora (prokaryotic) inhabitant to the gastrointestinal tract &amp; beneficial to the mammals but are sensitive to such antibiotics. Hence, to counteract this resulting imbalance, in general, vitamins are administered simultaneously, which in turn helps in rebuilding the desired level of micro-flora.<br>
Relevant prior art known to the inventor includes US Patent No. 4,806,368. This patent claims a dietary fibre based vitamin, mineral and beneficial bacteria tablet with enhanced bacterial viability. The tablets are used as nutritional supplement. In accordance with this patent the tablet essentially comprises of (i) apple fibre including insoluble fibre element, (ii) Lyophilised live bacteria, (iii) vitamin having antioxidant property, (iv) an amino acid having reducing property, (v) an alkaline mineral salt and means of stimulating bacterial growth. The live bacteria used are lactic acid producing bacteria and stimulant used are selected from autolysed yeast extract, acid whey and enzyme hydrolysed casein.    Further, according to this invention the Lactobacillus acidophilus<br><br>
either as tablets or powder sold in health food stores and comprising L acidophilus, carboxymethyl cellulose etc. have short term potency because of the rapid inactivation L acidophilus in the human stomach where the pH is around 2 to 3. The problem has been solved by introducing apple fibre supplemented with vitamins etc. The fibre mainly used as dietary supplement, on reconstitution, has exceptionally protective and stimulatory effect on growth of probiotics.<br>
US Patent No. 5,501,857 discloses again a nutritional and dietary composition, which<br>
combines certain incompatible substances separated from each other via multiple<br>
encapsulations.  The microorganisms used are a combination of yeast,  fungi and<br>
gastrointestinal bacteria. The method becomes cost extensive and requires special<br>
infrastructure for capsule- in-a capsule structure.<br>
US 6,468,525 relates to a food supplement formulation comprising 5 specific microflora<br>
(bacteria) in addition to other ingredients such as 1 glutamine, glycosamine, in order to<br>
support replacing mucosal linings particularly gastrointestinal lining.<br>
US 6,426,099 discloses herbal formulation for reestablishing intestinal bacteria.<br>
US 2003/0104091  teaches a novel probiotic, prokaryotic-based formulation and a<br>
method for reducing pathogenic bacteria. Particularly the composition comprises a genus<br>
Bacillus.<br>
US 5,773,000 advocates treatment of Clostridium difficile associated diseases such as<br>
colitis  and  antibiotic  associated diarrhea by administering  specific  antibodies  in<br>
combination with vancomycin, bacitracin, or metronidazole etc. However this treatment<br>
is   not   effective   as   relapses   occur   in   about    10   to   20%   of   the   cases.<br>
The primary etiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been Clostridium difficile. The<br><br>
indigenous microflora of a healthy individual suppresses the normally present C difficile. However, when the indigenous microflora are disrupted (e.g., during antibiotic treatment) overgrowth of C difficile may occur causing diarrhea and colitis. Though, treatment of C difficile with antibiotics has proven effective, many times relapse occurs. Generally, these diseases develop as a result of the production of two large toxins, toxin A (M.sub.r, 308,000) and toxin B (M.sub.r, 279,000), by the organism in the colon. Toxin A is believed to cause most of the gastrointestinal symptoms because of its enterotoxic activity in experimental animals. There is some evidence suggesting that the toxins act synergistically during the course of the disease and that the initial tissue damage caused by toxin A allows toxin B to exert its toxic effect. Immunoprophylaxis has also been suggested as a type of treatment. It is known that vaccination against toxins A and B stimulates active immunity against C. difficile disease in experimental animals. At the present time, however, suitable vaccines against the organism and its toxins have not been developed for individuals at high risk, and it is still unclear whether active immunization is appropriate.<br>
Altematively, treatment by passive immunization has been suggested. In preliminary studies, serum antibodies against a toxigenic isolate of C. difficile protected hamsters against C difficile disease when administered orally to the animals. Thus, passive immunity may be beneficial for prophylactic treatment.<br>
Passive immunization with bovine antibodies has been examined as a possible ahemative therapy in the treatment of other infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including diseases caused by rotavirus, enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coliy Vibrio cholerae, and Cryptosporidium parvum, and the results indicate that antibodies administered in this manner provide protection.<br><br>
Passive immunity from bovine antibodies offers the advantages that most animals and<br>
humans tolerate the material given orally and that the predominant antibody species<br>
present, immunoglobulin Gl (IgGl), is relatively resistant to proteolysis.<br>
US Patent 6,010,695 describes therapeutically effective amount of an indigestible<br>
oligosaccharides inhibits the infection of mammals by C difficile when administered<br>
enterally* Probably, the oligosaccharides stimulate the growth of probiotics there by<br>
suppressing C difficile (competition for survival) and intum reducing its ill effect.<br>
Two controlled trials have found that the probiotic £. coli achieved results comparable to<br>
those of mesalamine, a standard drug used to treat ulcerative colitis.<br>
In addition, a multicenter trial recently reported in Gastroenterology showed that<br>
probiotics     of chronic colitis inflammatory condition often afflicts patients with<br>
ulcerative colitis who have undergone surgical resection of the colon. Probiotics'<br>
possible role in managing Crohn's disease is still unclear.<br>
Similar to gastrointestinal disorders, fatty liver is a disorder commonly associated with obesity and diabetes, and recent findings suggest that increased production of ethanol due to the overgrowth of certain intestinal bacteria in obese individuals may contribute to the development of this disorder. This endorses the need to maintain the balanced ecosystem to mitigate and or avoid gastrointestinal disorder and its consequences.<br>
hi animal studies it has been seen that probiotic therapy for one month reduced chronic inflammation and fatty infiltration of the hver in obese mice with fatty liver. This finding supports the idea that overgrowth of ethanol-producing bacteria in the intestine may well play a role in fatty liver. A human trial is planned in order to gather proper evidence for the proposed therapy.<br><br>
Number of studies have shown that the probiotic therapy may be helpful for disorders unrelated to the gastrointestinal system. For example, there is evidence that probiotics can reduce the rate of respiratory infections in children, enhance immunity in the elderly, protect against cavities, and combat bacterial vaginosis, a common infection of the reproductive tract in women. It may also improve lactose intolerance and reduce food-related allergies.<br>
Patent 6^306,391 describes the drawbacks of commercially available combinations of lactobacillus and anti-infective agents into one formulation. It is reported that it is a mere admixture. Further, their study reports the non-viability of the organism beyond 7 days and poor functioning of the formulation in general.<br>
In order to solve this problem, they devised a stable fixed dose oral pharmaceutical formulation of at least one anti-infective agent and at least one microorganism, wherein the agent and/or the microorganism is first coated to provide protective barrier around it. Next, the process involves a step of combining the agent and the microorganism susceptible to the anti-infective agent used into a single pharmaceutical formulation in the form of a capsule or a tablet.<br>
The barrier protects the microorganism from the effect of the anti-infective agent to maintain the microorganism in a viable form for a period of at least three months. The agent can be an antibiotic such as amoxycillin and the microorganism can be Lactobacillus acidophilus.<br>
Their studies have shown the stability of the capsules for a period of three to thirty six months. However, in accordance with this invention, the protective barrier is essential in<br><br>
order to prevent direct contact of the organism with anti-infective agent to reduce its ill effect on microorganism.<br>
S.boulardii is a benefical probiotic, non-colonizing yeast species. It supports the function of GI tract where it can aggressively displace problematic yeast species, exemplified by Candida, increasing levels of IgA, inactivate bacterial toxins and release benefical polymers support establishment of friendly bacteria and help restore nutrient absorption capacity to the small intestine mucosa. It is resistant to gastric acidity and proteolysis and when taken orally becomes quickly established blooming soon after supplementation has began. In the gut it produces some B vitamins and as it becomes established it eliminates unfriendly strains of yeast such as S. Candida. During use, friendly probiotic bacteria are able to colonize in the GI tract supporting micro ecology.<br>
S, boulardii has been used in Europe for many decades to treat diarrhea. Clinical trials have shown it effective in preventing or treating diarrhea brought on by antibiotics. Further studies have shown it can support gut function with many conditions, including food allergies, parasites, Crohn's disease, Candida, Salmonella, travelers' diarrhea, HIV diarrhea and Pseudomonas, Clinical studies also demonstrate the protective effect of S, boulardii in intestinal infections, including Clostridium difficile and cholera. The protective effect of 5. boulardii involves several types of activity in the epithehal tissue of the digestive tract, including inactivation of bacterial toxins, stimulation of intestinal immune response, and release of polyamines. Further, these preparations are not commercially available, which indicates that the therapy is not yet well established and proven. Moreover, to prevent ill effects of anti-infective agents, one has to administer S. boulardii separately there by requiring administration of two components making the<br><br>
process cumbersome and decreasing compliance to a patient. Additionally, coordinating administration and action of these two different components may pose problems.<br>
It may be noted that most of the existing formulations are prepared using prokaryotics, preferably lactic acid producing bacteria with adjunct in the form of antibodies, antibiotics, drugs, other probiotics that are prokaryotics in origin, plant or herbal origin fibres and stimulants. Further, these formulations are generally used as nutrient or food supplement or dietary formulations. The formulations used to reducing the pathogenic organisms, prokaryotics are either administered separately in coordination with antibiotics. Prokaryotics, when used in combination with anti-infective agent such as antibiotics, are required to be coated with protected barrier to prevent its direct contact with the anti-infective agent. The direct contact has to be avoided in order to take care of the inactivation or reduction in potency and or efficiency of the organism arising through such contacts. In tum the fatal effects arising through such contact are also taken care of There are no reports on the single formulation consisting of eukaryotics preferably S.boulardii and adjuncts such as other probiotics, other physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible components including anti-infective agents in one formulation while maintaining efficiency.<br>
We have discovered that the eukaryotics with a defined nucleus have a better survival rate over prokaryotics under diverse environmental conditions. Further, the eukaryotics when mixed with other anti-infective agents are not affected adversely like prokaryotics thereby increasing the potency of the formulation. Thus the formulation comprising of eukaryotics and pharmaceutically acceptable substances show improved efficiency and shelf life. Eukaryotics, particularly yeast can be stored while maintaining its potency for<br><br>
a long period and the potency can be revived only at a targeted site. Additionally, yeast stimulates the growth of probiotics inhabitant to gastrointestinal tract and maintains the balance of the ecosystem, which in turn prevents and or minimizes the dominance of pathogenic organisms and ill effects of the products produced by such harmful microflora. Eukaryotics, specifically Yeast through its metabolites enhances effective assimilation of minerals and other nutritional components. Amongst eukaryotics yeast is preferable and among various species of yeast S. boulardii is more preferable in view of *having better growth rate as compared to other species such as S cerevisiae, which has been reported for being used as dietary adjuncts.<br>
The novelty of the invention resides in using an eukaryotics particularly yeast, more particularly the specific yeast grown in a specific manner in combination with physiologically and or pharmaceutically acceptable components in one formulation, without using ant protective barriers, while maintaining its efficiency and potency. While using single formulation, the invention becomes cost effective by reducing the cost on providing barriers for isolation of the components used. It also makes proper coordinated action of the components and reduces the administration of two drugs proving user fiiendly. Additionally, the yeast used is in such a state that it gets activated only on reaching the desired site i.e. gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, yeast does not react with adjunct during its storage and travel to the gastrointestinal tract and also does not gets inactivated. Being biologically evolved the organism stands better chances of survival through mere competition. It acts in synergism either with anti-infective agent or food supplements to maintain balance of ecosystem through various modes as herein before described. This in turn combats the diseases arising through dominance of undesired organisms and its metabolic products such as toxins.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a eukaryotic-based synergistic formulation for gastro-intestinal disorders.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to provide a eukaryotic-based formulation that eliminates the shortcomings of the existing formulations that are generally base on prokaryotics.<br>
Other object of this invention is to provide a formulation that regulates the balance of microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals.<br>
Another  object   of the  present  invention  provides   a  eukaryotic-based  probiotic formulation with more stability and efficacy.<br>
Still other object of the present invention is to provide a formulation, which reduces if not prevents the ill effects of the harmful organisms.<br>
Yet other object of the present invention is to provide a formulation that stimulates the growth of probiotics and inhibits the growth of undesired harmful microbes. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a single formulation, which can take care of secondary ill effects induced through ingestion or administration of pharmaceuticals or physiological components, to which the gut-micro-flora is associated. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation where in an introduction of protective barrier is eliminated.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a formulation that is user friendly and has improved compliance by combining two drugs in one formulation. Further the drugs are complementary to each- other. Since the components are incorporated in single formulation, they get administered together and thus the action gets synchronized. Further object is to provide a formulation that releases the components at desired site.<br><br>
In another aspect of this invention there is provided a process for isolating, modifying, culturing, lyophilizing, drying and preparing formulations using eukaryotic organisms.
