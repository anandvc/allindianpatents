COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (SECTION 10, RULE 13)<br>
A NON INTEGRATED DEVICE TO CONTROL MOISTURE LEVEL IN ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT WITH IMPROVED REFILLABILITY"<br>
MEVADA VINOD PITAMBARDAS<br>
Indian National Residing At<br>
2, Icchbanagar, Opp. Gyanjyot High School,<br>
Ranna Park, Ghatlodia, Ahmedabad-380 061,<br>
Gujarat State, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a device for controlling the level of moisture entering in electrical equipments. This invention particularly relates to a device for controlling the level of moisture using moisture absorbing material such as silica gel cubes gel.<br>
In electrical equipment, moisture level must be at specific value for optimum performance of the device. In electrical devices like transformer, where high power handling capacity is required, some means of cooling medium is provided. During cooling process, moisture level in the equipment increases. The moisture level in these equipments must be controlled at specific point for better cooling and performance. It is very difficult to keep the level of moisture constant during the change in volume of the cooling medium and/or airspace caused by temperature gradients. Out of known moisture absorbing materials, Silica gel cubes gel is the most popular one. Its colour being an indication of remaining life of the silica gel cubes, when becomes blue from pink, it is advisable to change the silica gel cubes gel. There are few devices of the same class for which inventor has applied for but they possess plenty of drawbacks. Such as,<br>
» Hole provided for refilling of the silica gel cubes is kept small; therefore large cubes of silica can not be replaced easily from the jar.<br>
• For refilling of silica cubes, it is required to detach the whole unit from its location which is time consuming and<br><br>
cumbersome .Moreover, that is not even practical as the device used is heavy.<br>
•	Threads provided in the aluminum flange has very short life and in the existing products refilling is possible only when unit is detached from its original position. So frequent refilling of silica gel cubes wear the threads.<br>
•	To solve the above problem whole flange can be made up of Stainless Steel but it will make the unit heavy as well as expensive.<br>
•	Acrylic jar is fixed with the flanges with help of binding solution. This creates many problems such as<br>
1. Water in rainy season can be deposited inside as no<br>
means of isolation such as gasket etc. is provided. Breaking of the jar does not permit change of jar instead the whole unit becomes useless as the jar is fixed using binding solution. »   Units available in the market are made for standard size of pipes and the same unit can not be used for different diameter pipelines.<br>
Objects of the Invention :-<br>
So with motto of providing a device to keep the moisture level constant and minimum as required in the electrical devices, inventor has invented "A NON INTEGRATED DEVICE TO CONTROL MOISTURE LEVEL IN ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT WITH IMPROVED REFILLABILITY".<br><br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level constant even though the volume of the cooling medium and/or airspace caused by temperature gradients changes by large amount by placing silica gel cubes and refilling when required-<br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level which possesses non integrated design to give high maintainability and ability to change even single small part of the device,<br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level in which Silica Gel cubes can be easily replaced by providing larger refilling passage and easy to operate locking mechanism to make the refilling process convenient.<br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level which is not required to be detached from its original location fully during refilling of the Silica Gel cubes.<br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level which is useful for all types of pipe, just by replacing threaded hollow cylinder of required size.<br>
The further object of this invention is to provide a device for controlling the moisture level in high level of isolation is achieved<br><br>
By using nitrile gasket with quarter circle cross section are used to ensure waterproof and air tight joints.<br>
Description of the Invention:-<br>
This invention will be described with reference to accompanying<br>
drawings wherein<br>
Fig. A, B and C shows top view, elevation and bottom view of Upper<br>
Cover respectively.<br>
Fig. D, E and F shows elevation, top view, and bottom view of<br>
Upper Plate respectively.<br>
Fig. G, H shows top view and front view of the Gasket respectively.<br>
Fig. I shows Fitting Assembly.<br>
Fig. J, K and L shows front view, top view and bottom view of Lower<br>
Plate respectively.<br>
Fig. M, N, O and P shows front view, section, top view and bottom<br>
view of Plastic Cap respectively.<br>
Fig. Q shows front view of Jar.<br>
Fig. R shows perspective view of the device.<br>
As shown in fig. A, B and C, the invention consists of upper cover (1) which comprises of central air inlet hole (5), PCD (Pitch Circle Dimension) (3) with concentric hollow threaded cylinder (4) having inner diameter equal to outer diameter of the pipeline coming from the electrical equipment. Upper plate (6) and upper cover (1) are joined with the help of locking mechanism (2) which consists of a fastener to hold a nut, a washer and a bolt as indicated in Fig. I.<br><br>
This locking mechanism (2) allows easy detachment of the acrylic jar (18) from the upper cover (1) which further solves the problem of refilling of humidity absorbing material as experienced in known devices, Moreover, easy detachment obviates die problem of refilling of silica gel cubes which is very cumbersome task in known device.<br>
A transparent acrylic jar (18) is placed between upper plate (6) and lower plate (13) as shown in Fig. R. Here acrylic jar (18) is not fixed permanently by binding material as in known devices .This is how it is made detachable. So the problem of ineptness of the device due to breaking of acrylic jar (18) is solved. Central stub (10) with threads at both ends, passes through upper central hole (7) which is placed in the central supporting plate (8) of the upper cover (6). Upper plate (6) and lower plate (13) are connected with the help of central stub (10), nut (11) and washer (12). Lower plate (13) consists of Air circulation holes (14) for circulation of air and lower central hole (15) through which central stub (10) passes and connects upper plate (6) to lower plate (13). A plastic cap (16) is covered on lower plate (13) which has threaded hole (17) in the bottom to make a contact with lower plate (13),<br>
As stated earlier, the design used in this invention is non-integrated. As the parts other than upper cover (1) can be detached easily the whole unit Is not required to be disassembled from the working sight. The upper cover (1) consists of central air inlet hole (5) for allowing the air to go inside the acrylic jar (18) and hollow<br><br>
threaded cylinder (4) having inner diameter equal to outer diameter of the pipeline coming from the electrical equipment. The hollow threaded cylinder (4) is made up of Stainless Steel which provides long life of the thread and can withstand against wear and tear. As other parts of the upper cover (1) are made up of aluminum, the device is light in weight. With the change of size of the pipe coming from the electrical equipment, the required size of hollow threaded cylinder (4) can be replaced which makes the device useful even for non standard pipes. The upper plate (6) consists of central supporting plate (8) having upper central hole (7) to hold central stub (10). Central stub (10) having threaded ends at both the ends so that it can be tightened with the help of bolt at upper central hole (7) and lower central hole (15). Central stub (10) is useful to support entire device. An acrylic jar (18) is kept between upper plate (6) and lower plate (13) to provide isolation from outside environment. Moisture absorbing material such as Silica gel cubes are kept on the lower plate (13) within the acrylic jar (18). A gasket (9) is provided on the outer side of acrylic jar (18) on the lower plate (13). The quarter circle cross section of the gasket (9) provides complete isolation from outside environmental elements such as humidity, dew, raindrops, dust etc. Lower plate (13) having lower central hole (15) allows the central stub (10) to pass through. The plastic cap (16) having two holes (19) on the periphery enables the air circulation within the device.<br><br>
Working of the invention:<br>
When any electrical equipment like transformer is loaded or unloaded, the oil temperature inside the transformer tank rises or falls, accordingly, the air volume inside the tank changes, by either sucking in or pushing out the air. This phenomenon is called "Breathing of the transformer".<br>
The air which is being sucked in contains foreign impurities such as dust particles and humidity which changes dielectric strength of Transformer oil, hence, it is necessary that, the air entering into the transformer should be made free form moisture &amp; foreign impurities.<br>
The device is connected to an outlet pipe of the transformer and the air which is being sucked by transformer is made to pass thorough the said device to dehumidify the air and to remove foreign impurities. The silica gel cubes which are fed in this device is in form of hard blue crystal which has considerable absorption power for moisture. Here, other alternative humidity absorbing material may also be utilized depending upon the climate condition and other factors. When, silica gel cubes get saturated by moisture, it changes its colour to pinkish white. For proper dehumidiUcation of air, it is absolutely necessary that this charge of silica gel cubes is reconditioned from pinkish white to deep blue by heating it to a temperature 200° C in oven.<br><br>
The air, which is passed through the humidity absorbing material is first made to pass through the oil cap of the said device. The oil removes ail the foreign impurities from air which otherwise enters in the acrylic jar filled up with humidity absorbing material. The air containing foreign impurities can not be dehumidified properly by the humidity absorbing material. Thus it is essential to make the air pass through the cap which contains oil.<br>
