GELLAN SEAMLESS BREAKABLE CAPSULE AND PROCESS FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING THEREOF.<br>
The present invention relates to a breakable<br>
capsule having a fluid core and a solid or fluid breakable<br>
shell.<br>
In this invention, the term "capsule" means a<br>
spherical or substantially spherical delivery system of a<br>
substance, said substance being hereinafter referred to as<br>
"the core", and said substance being encapsulated into a<br>
shell, the shell being breakable and releasing the core<br>
when broken or ruptured. The term fluid means flowing as<br>
opposed to being in a solid state. According to the<br>
invention, the term fluid includes finely divided solids,<br>
such as a powder, and also gel, or any physical state of a<br>
product wherein said product changes shape or direction<br>
uniformly, in response to an external force imposed upon<br>
it. According to the invention, fluid preferably refers to<br>
a flowable or gellified product.<br>
The term "breakable capsule" refers to a capsule<br>
as hereabove defined, wherein the shell can be ruptured by<br>
means of a pressure, which results in the release of the<br>
core. According to an embodiment, the capsule of the<br>
invention may be specifically designed to be incorporated<br>
into a fluid medium such as for example a gel, a pasty or a<br>
liquid medium containing water; in this embodiment, the<br>
capsules may be suspended or mixed by any suitable means in<br>
order to bring an visual effect of homogeneous dispersion<br>
of the capsules in the medium; advantageously, the shell<br>
and/or the core of the capsule is coloured. According to<br>
another embodiment, the capsule of the invention is<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
2<br>
dispersed into a solid or fluid medium, such as for example<br>
a powder; advantageously, the shell and/or the core of the<br>
capsule is coloured.<br>
Such capsules are useful for numerous applications,<br>
such as in oral care application (toothpaste, mouthwash,<br>
gums...) , in food applications such as confectionary, dairy,<br>
bakery, savory, in neutraceutical applications or in<br>
pharmaceutical or in personal care products such as<br>
cosmetic products and the like.<br>
In the present patent application, the term<br>
"capsule" will be used to designate any size of capsules,<br>
including macrocapsules and microcapsules and preferably<br>
capsule which larger diameter is from 0.5 mm up to 8 mm,<br>
preferably 1 to 5 mm; more preferably 1.2 to 3 mm.<br>
It is of particular interest to obtain seamless<br>
capsules, as the breakability of a welded capsule (also<br>
designated in the prior art as softgel or hard capsule) may<br>
be influenced by the easy or unwanted rupture of the weld.<br>
Fuji patent application JP10291928 describes a<br>
capsule obtained through a co-extrusion process, wherein<br>
the external liquid phase comprises gellan and calcium<br>
salts. Gellan gum, first discovered in 1978, is produced by<br>
the microorganism Sphingomonas elodea.<br>
The Applicant has found that the production of<br>
gellan capsule through the Fuj i process was not<br>
satisfactory and resulted in poor quality capsules and in<br>
processing difficulties, because the gellan was actually<br>
gelling during the co-extrusion, and it was not possible to<br>
obtain spherical and homogeneous breakable capsules.<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
3<br>
For this reason, the Applicant tried to improve the<br>
Fuji process and found that the drawbacks of the prior art<br>
process may be due to the presence of calcium salts, and<br>
more generally to divalent metal salts in gellan during the<br>
co-extrusion step. Thus, the Applicant carried out a<br>
process wherein the co-extrusion liquid phase containing<br>
gellan was performed in absence of calcium salts, and<br>
observed that, surprisingly, the resulting capsules had the<br>
required spherical or substantially spherical shape and<br>
homogeneous sizes. However, the capsules thus obtained<br>
could not be used as such, because the shell was too soft<br>
and the resulting capsules were not breakable capsules; the<br>
Applicant found a solution to this subsequent technical<br>
problem by contacting the capsules with divalent metal<br>
ions, preferably calcium or magnesium ions, or by using<br>
organic acid solution, once the co-extrusion process is<br>
finished, and this finally lead to satisfactory breakable<br>
capsules.<br>
Thus, this invention relates to a process for<br>
manufacturing seamless breakable capsules and to new<br>
seamless breakable capsules.<br>
The process of the invention comprises a step (A)<br>
of co-extrusion of an external and hydrophilic liquid phase<br>
and an internal and lipophilic liquid phase, in order to<br>
form a capsule having a core comprising the internal and<br>
lipophilic phase and a shell comprising the external and<br>
hydrophilic phase; and a step (B) of washing and immersing<br>
the capsules into an aqueous solution preferably containing<br>
a curing agent, the curing agent being one of the means for<br>
making the shell breakable as required for the intended<br>
use; optionally a step (C) of drying the obtained capsules<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PGT/IB2006/002905<br>
4<br>
or optionally a step (D) of suspending the capsules into an<br>
fluid medium.<br>
The co-extrusion process comprises three main<br>
stages: compound drop formation, shell solidification and<br>
capsule collection. The compound drop is a sphere of the<br>
liquid fill phase inside the shell phase. The liquid fill<br>
phase is hereinafter referred to as "the core". The shell<br>
phase is hereinafter referred to as "the shell".<br>
According to the invention, the external liquid<br>
phase includes a gelling agent comprising gellan gum, alone<br>
or in combination with at least one suitable gelling agent,<br>
a filler, and a metal sequestering agent, the liquid<br>
preferably being aqueous, more preferably the liquid is<br>
water, preferably desionized or osmozed water.<br>
By "gelling agent" in the meaning of this<br>
invention, it is referred to an agent able to convert an<br>
aqueous phase from a flowable or fluid liquid to a solid or<br>
a gel.<br>
By "sequestering agent" in the meaning of this<br>
invention it is referred to any agent complexing, chelating<br>
or sequestering bivalent ions such as calcium or magnesium<br>
ions.<br>
The term "substantially", when referring to a<br>
number or value, means + or - 10 % of the value; when<br>
referring to a sphere, it means a distorted sphere which<br>
larger diameter is + or - 10 % of the diameter of the<br>
expected sphere.<br>
The term "wet capsule" in the meaning of this<br>
invention, refers to a capsule which shell includes a<br>
positive amount of water. The term wet capsule is used for<br>
the calculation of percentages of ingredients in the final<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
5<br>
product or shell, as opposed to the calculation based on<br>
the dry weight of said final product or shell.<br>
The breakable capsule according to the invention<br>
preferably has a crush strength from 0.01 to 5 kp,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 2.5 kp, edge values being included.<br>
The crush strength of the capsule is measured by<br>
continuously applying a load vertically onto one particle<br>
until rupture. The crush strength of the capsules in the<br>
present invention is measured by using a texturometer TA.XT<br>
plus from Micro Stable System in compression mode or a<br>
LLOYD - CHATILLON Digital Force Gauge, Model DFIS 50,<br>
having a capacity of 25Kg, a resolution of 0.02 Kg, and an<br>
accuracy of +/- 0,15 %. The force gauge is attached to a<br>
stand; the capsule is positioned in the middle of a plate<br>
that is moved up with a manual thread screw device.<br>
Pressure is then applied manually and the gauge records the<br>
maximum force applied at the very moment of the rupture of<br>
the capsule, (measured in Kg or in Lb) . Rupture of the<br>
capsule results in the release of the core.<br>
Gellan gum is a hydrocolloid which, according to<br>
the invention, can be used as the sole gelling agent of the<br>
external liquid phase, or in combination with at least one<br>
ohter gelling agent. Other suitable gelling agents may be<br>
alginates, agar, carragheenan, pectines, xanthan gum,<br>
Arabic gum, tara gum, ghatti gum, karaya gum, dextran,<br>
curdlan, welan gum, rhamsan gum or modified starches.<br>
Suitable gellan gums are for example, but not limited to<br>
deacylated gellan gum. Kelcogel® can be mentioned as a<br>
suitable gellan gum.<br>
The amount of gelling agent present in the shell<br>
is 4 to 95%, preferably 5 to 75%, even more preferably is<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
6<br>
10 to 50%, more preferably 12 to 40 % by weight of the<br>
total dry weight of the shell.<br>
When used in combination with at least another<br>
gelling agent, the weight ratio between gellan gum and the<br>
other gelling agent(s) is from 80/20 to 20/80, preferably<br>
75/25 to 25/75, and even more preferably from 60/40 to<br>
50/50.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of gelling agent /<br>
dried shell is greater than 10%, preferably greater than<br>
12, more preferably greater than 15%.<br>
The filler is any suitable material that can<br>
increase the percentage of dry material in the external<br>
liquid phase or bring filming properties. Increasing the<br>
dry material amount in a shell results in solidifying the<br>
shell, and in making it physically more resistant or<br>
impermeable. Preferably, the filler is selected from the<br>
group comprising starch derivatives such as dextrin,<br>
maltodextrin, polyol, cyclodextrin (alpha, beta or gamma),<br>
or cellulose derivatives such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
(HPC), methylcellulose (MC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC),<br>
polyethylene glycol derivatives, polyvinyl alcohol, polyols<br>
or mixture thereof.<br>
The amount of filler in the shell is at most<br>
98.5%, preferably from 25 to 95% and even more preferably<br>
from 50 to 80% by weight on the total dry weight of the<br>
shell.<br>
Using a divalent metal sequestering or complexing<br>
agent allows trapping the divalent metal ions which are<br>
possibly present in the components of the liquid phase<br>
including water and which have a gelling effect on gellan.<br>
Thus, the use of a divalent metal sequestering agent,<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
7<br>
preferably of a calcium ion sequestering agent, allows the<br>
gellan to be co-extruded without undesirable or<br>
uncontrollable gelling during the co-extrusion.<br>
The amount of sequestering agent is at most 2%,<br>
preferably at most 1% and even more preferably at most 0.5%<br>
by weight of the total dry weight of the shell.<br>
Preferably, the water used for the external phase<br>
is deionized water and/or osmozed water; using processing<br>
water remains possible but needs adjusting the amount of<br>
divalent metal sequestering agent.<br>
The sequestering agent is a metal salt,<br>
preferably selected from the group comprising trisodium<br>
citrate, trisodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate,<br>
sodium hexametaphosphate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The hydrophilic external liquid phase may further<br>
comprise at least one plasticizer, which may be at least<br>
one of glycerol, sorbitol, maltitol, triacetine or<br>
polyethylene glycol type product, or a polyalcohol with<br>
plasticizing or humectant properties. Advantageously, the<br>
hydrophilic external liquid phase further comprises at<br>
least one colouring agent or pigment; according to a first<br>
embodiment, the colouring agent or the pigment is in a form<br>
of a powder or a suspension stable in an aqueous medium.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
liquid phase may include perfumes, aromas, fragrances or<br>
any odoring agent.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
co-extrusion step (A) of the process can be performed at a<br>
temperature being from room temperature to 100°C.<br>
Advantageously, it is performed at room temperature, which<br>
means between 18 and 30°C, preferably 20-25 °C under<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
8<br>
The co-extrusion step is a synchronous extrusion<br>
of two liquids: the external and hydrophilic liquid phase,<br>
and the internal and lipophilic liquid phase which can be<br>
performed using an apparatus and a process as described in<br>
EP 513603, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention,<br>
after the co-extrusion step (A), the solidification step is<br>
performed by keeping cold the capsules in order to ensure<br>
correct gelling of the shell, for example by contacting<br>
them with a cold bath. The cold bath may preferably be cold<br>
oil or cold emulsion. Cold means any temperature below<br>
18"°C, preferably the temperature is from 2 to 10 °C, more<br>
preferably 4 to 6 °C.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
capsules may then be centrifuged in order to remove the<br>
surplus oil, and/or washed with organic solvent (such as<br>
acetone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, petroleum ether, etc.)<br>
also to remove the surplus oil, and optionally dried in a<br>
air flow at controlled temperature and humidity. The<br>
relative humidity of the drying air is 20% to 60%,<br>
preferably 3 0 to 50%; the temperature of the drying air is<br>
of 15 to 60 °C, preferably 35 to 45 °C.<br>
According to another embodiment, the capsules<br>
are preferably immersed into an aqueous solution or an<br>
emulsion containing a curing agent which comprises a<br>
divalent salt and optionally an acid. The effect of the<br>
immersion step is to wash out the oil remaining at the<br>
periphery of the capsule, and to gradually strengthen the<br>
shell, notably through dehydration and osmotic equilibrium.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
after immersion, the capsules are dried in the same<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
9<br>
conditions as mentioned above. According to another<br>
embodiment of the invention, after immersion, the capsules<br>
are not dried.<br>
The curing agent preferably comprises divalent<br>
metal ions, or a mixture of divalent metal ions, such as<br>
calcium ions or magnesium ions.<br>
The aqueous solution or emulsion containing the<br>
curing agent is preferably a divalent metal salt solution,<br>
preferably containing calcium or magnesium salts, more<br>
preferably, calcium dichloride, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
sulfate or dicalcium phosphate. This solution may be the<br>
aqueous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion. This solution<br>
can be at a temperature comprised between 2°C and room<br>
temperature. Advantageously, the aqueous solution<br>
containing the curing agent is maintained under acid<br>
conditions of pH, and preferably at a pH less than 5, more<br>
preferably from 2 to 4. According to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, the aqueous solution or emulsion<br>
containing a curing agent is a calcium chloride solution<br>
having a pH of 3 to 4.<br>
The aqueous solution containing the curing agent<br>
can also contain preservatives or bactericides such as<br>
benzoate, parabens, diols, cetylpyridinium chloride,<br>
diazolidinyl urea or any preservatives used for food,<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetic products.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
process comprises the steps of co-extruding the above<br>
mentioned external and internal liquid phases, optionally<br>
solidifying and/or gelling the surface of the shell by<br>
keeping the capsule under cold conditions, as explained<br>
herein above, optionally centrifugating, optionally washing<br><br>
WO 2007/012981	PCT/IB2006/002905<br>
10<br>
the so-obtained capsules with an organic solvent, immersing<br>
the resulting capsules into an aqueous solution containing<br>
a curing agent, and optionally drying the capsules.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
solidifying/gelling/curing steps can be gathered into a<br>
single step, for example by dipping the capsules into a<br>
bath, under cold conditions, containing the divalent metal<br>
salts, preferably calcium or magnesium salts, more<br>
preferably, calcium dichloride, calcium sulfate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate. This bath may be an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion.<br>
The capsules manufactured through the process<br>
