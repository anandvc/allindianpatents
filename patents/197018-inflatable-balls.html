				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to inflatable ball^ and more particularly to inflatable footballs such as rugby footbaJIs or other balls of non-spherical shape.<br>
Rugby balls_are inflatable balls of a generally ovoid shage.   The balls are typically provided with valve means to enable inflation thereof to be effected.   Traditional rugby balls had an outer leather cover consisting of four panels stitched together to make the whole.   The outer cover contained a bladder to which-access could be had for the purpose of inflation through a laced access opening.   Modem rugby balls usually comprise four panels of a synthetic material stitched together and provided with an inflation valves which passes through the centre point of one of the synthetic panels.<br>
A principle object of this invention is to provide a ball having improved ballistic properties and which also facilitates manufacture and assembly.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an inflatable ball of generally oval shape having an outer cover comprising a plurality of panels connected together along seams, wherein a permanently accessible inflation valve aperture is located on a seam.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that advantages accme when a rugby ball or other ball of similar shape has the inflation valve positioned on<br>
the line of a seam between two adjacent panels.  A ball of this construction<br>
provides demonstrably improved ballistic properties.   Unlike traditional balls<br>
with a laced (and therefore openable and closable) access opening for<br>
inflating the bladder, the balls of this invention have an inflation valve which is<br>
always accessible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment there is provided an inflatable ball of<br>
generally oval shape, for example a rugby ball, having an outer cover<br>
comprising a plurality of panels connected together along seams and a<br>
permanently accessible inflation valve located on a seam.<br>
The inflation valve is preferably located in a central zone of the seam. The cove^ is p\efehab   ft-nade of lour panels of synthetic material,<br>
especially a synthetic sheet plastics material.<br>
The ball preferably includes a valve body located under the cover and having defined on the outer surface thereof a channel receiving the inturned edge portions of the cover panels joined by the seam.<br>
Preferably the valve assembly comprises a valve body and a flange disposed around and over the valve body and securing same to an inflatable bladder located within the cover, the channel being arranged on the outer surface of the flange.  The panels are preferably stitched together.<br>
Another preferred embodiment comprises an inflatable rugby or other<br>
oval ball of the type having a cover formed of panels which are stitched or connected together to form seams free of any openable and closable access to the interior, wherein the valve is located on a seam and an inflation tube extends from the valve through or connects with an aperture in the seam.<br>
Preferred balls of this embodiment comprises an inflatable bladder within the cover and having defined on the outer surface thereof a channel which receives the inturned edge portions of the cover panels joined by the seam and from the underside of which seam extends the inflation tube.<br>
This invention includes an inflation point member for an inflatable ball, the member having a face in which there is a channel whose base has defined therein an aperture to receive an inflation tube.<br>
The invention also provides a bladder with the inflation point thereof adapted to be positioned under a seam. In a preferred embodiment, such a bladder comprises in inflation tube which extends from the bottom of a channel defined on the exterior of the bladder. The bladder will be normally of a generally oval shape.<br>
tecordinss?$^j0/the present invention there is provided an inflatable ball of oval shape having an outer cover comprising a plurality of panels connected together along seams, an inflatable bladder within the outer cover, the bladder having an inflation valve assembly located beneath the cover, said assembly comprising a flange surrounding an inflation valve and an inflation tube extending from the valve assembly and passing through an aperture in a seam of the outer cover to be permanently accessible, wherein said flange defines an outer facing surface, said surface bearing against the outer cover each side of the seam and said surface further accommodating inturned edge portions of the adjacent cover panels joined by the seam.<br>
This invention is further described and illustrated by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a prior art rugby ball viewed towards the inflation valve.<br>
Figure 2       is a side view of a rugby ball of this invention viewed towards the inflation valve,<br>
Figure 3       is a transverse cross section through a rugby ball of this invention showing the inflation valve in side elevation and the channel through the flange on the bladder, and<br>
Figure 4	is a perspective view of a bladder used in \ile rugby ball of<br>
Figure 2, viewed towards the inflation valve.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a prior art rugby ball. The ball comprises a cover made of four substantially equal shape panels connected together along the edges to form seams 3, of which three panels, 1a, 1 b and 1c only are visible.  The panels are normally made of a synthetic plastics material, such as a plastics sheet material.  An inflation valve aperture 2 is located centrally in one of the panels as shown.   The valve is of a conventional type.<br>
A rugby ball of this invention is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows a ball having a valve assembly 2 located along the line of the seam 3 between adjacent interconnected panels of the ball.   The panels are normally Pitched together, as is usual.   The illustrated rugby bail cover may be similar to the prior art other than for the valve assembly location 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows a transverse cross section through the ball of Figure 2.<br>
The wall 10 of the bladder hast attached thereto a flange 4 which is seated over the valve (not shown) and which serves to connect the valve to the wall 10 of the bladder.   The flange 4 is made of a natural or synthetic rubber and lies in normal use under the cover of the ball.  The valve itself, which is not visible, and the flange 4 together form the valve assembly 2.   The valve is provided with an inflation tube 5 (often referred to as a nipple) which passes through a small aperture in the seam to facilitate inflation of the ball.   The aperture is of a fixed size and is not selectively openable and closable.<br>
The invention thus provides inflatable balls wherein the inflation tube extends through an aperture in a seam, which aperture is bounded by stitching or other inseparable joining between the panels.  As can be seen more clearly in Figure 4, the flange 4 on bladder 6 is provided on the outer face 9 with a channel 7 aligned with the longitudinal axis of the bladder 6 and the channel receives the cover panel intumed edges forming the seam 3 along which the valve is located.   The inflation tube 5 extends from the base 8 of the channel 7 in a central portion thereof.   The flange 4 has defined Iheiein an aperture to accommodate the inflation tube? 5.<br>
The invention includes balls having an inflation point member (the valve assembly and more particularly the flange 4 in the illustrated embodiment) adapted to be positioned under a seam as well as ball bladders having an<br>
inflation point area adapted to be positioned under a seam.<br>
When place kicking a ball in a rugby game, kickers will always impact the seam of the ball with the foot, inevitably placing an opposed seam directly away from them.   When a ball of this invention is kicked the ball travesis in a straight line, whereas conventional balls usually take a curved trajectory because of the offset weight of the valve, which will be positioned to one side of the direction of the kick.  This will be apparent from Figure 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
