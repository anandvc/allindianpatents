COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"VEHICLE REAR STRUCTURE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a rear structure of a vehicle suitable for improving maintenanceability of a rear combination lamp and slimming up of the rear portion of the vehicle.<br><br>
[0002] [Description of the Related Art]<br>
As a vehicle rear structure having a rear combination lamp disposed at the rear of the storage box of the vehicle such as a motorcycle, for example, a structure having a lamp 70 mounted on the outer wall 54a of the rear portion of the storage box 50 with a plurality of screws is shown in Fig. 2 of Japanese Patent Laid Open No.203449/1998 "LAMP MOUNTING STUCTURE FOR THE REAR OF VEHICLES" (the reference numerals are quoted from the aforementioned patent publication, hereinafter).<br>
[0003] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
When a lamp 70 is mounted on the outer wall 54a of the rear portion of the storage box 50, the lamp 70 must be removed from the storage box 50 when replacing the bulb of the lamp 70. in addition, when a structure in which the bulb is attached and detached from the space between the storage box 50 and the lamp 70 is employed, a significantly large space for inserting a hand must be provided between the storage box 50 and the lamp 70.<br>
[0004]<br>
In order to remove the lamp 70 from the storage box 50, a plurality of screws have to be loosened, and thus it takes a lot of time for removal. When a large space is provided<br><br>
between the storage box 50 and the lamp 70, for example, in the case where a storage box upsized for improving storing capability and a lamp upsized for improving visibility are disposed at the rear of the vehicle, the aforementioned large space may increase the size or the length of the rear portion of the vehicle, which may influence on upsizing or appearance of the vehicle.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to improve maintenanceability of the lamp at the rear of the vehicle and to slimming up of the rear portion of the vehicle by improving the vehicle rear structure.<br>
[0006] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the invention according to Claim 1 is a vehicle rear structure in which a storage box is disposed below the hinged seat, and a rear combination lamp is disposed at the rear of the storage box, characterized in that the rear combination lamp is set closer to the storage box by providing a pair of left and right bulbs on the rear combination lamp, forming left and right access openings for performing maintenance of the bulbs on the storage box, and closing the access openings with lids.<br>
[0007]<br>
Providing left and right access opening for maintenance<br><br>
of the bulb on the storage box facilitates maintenance work such as replacement of the bulb or the like from the inside of the storage box, and enables the rear combination lamp to be set closer to the storage box, so that even when a large rear combination lamp is disposed at the rear of a large storage box, a compact design of the rear portion of the vehicle is realized.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the lamp axis passing through the center of the bulb is inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle body.<br>
By employing a structure in which the lamp axis is inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle body, for example, the lamp axis can be inclined in the direction that facilitates maintenance of the bulb through the access opening.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the left and right lamp axes are directed so as to fan out toward the front.<br>
By directing the left and right lamp axes so as to fan out toward the front, a large massed space can be reserved between the left and right bulbs of the rear combination lamp, and thus the storage box can be extended toward the rear, so<br><br>
that the volume of the storage box may be increased.<br>

243,	243 are arranged in the vicinity of the front surface, the rear surface, the left surface, and the right surface of the fuel tank 230 respectively.<br>
Since the divided heat shielding plates 241, 242, 243, 243 are employed, the extent of thermal effect from the engine 211 and from the radiator 221 can be taken into consideration, and their size may be arbitrarily minimized depending on the configuration of each surface of the fuel tank 230. As a result, each heat shielding plate 241, 242, 243, 243 may be relatively small in size, and may be manufactured extremely easily. In addition, since the molding die may be small in size and thus it requires only a small amount of material, the manufacturing cost may be reduced as well.<br>
[0041]<br>
The front heat shielding plate 241 covering the front surface of the fuel tank 230 is a resin sheet of a hard resin or the like in substantially square in front view. Since the front heat shielding plate 241 is formed of a resin sheet, it is very simple in shape and may thus be manufactured at lower cost.<br>

[0062]<br>
Fig. 18 is an explanatory drawing of the rear combination lamp of the motorcycle according to the present invention, in a state in which the rear combination lamp 267 is viewed from the rear side of the vehicle.<br>
The rear combination lamp 267 comprises rear turn signal lamps 541, 542 at the upper left position and at the upper right position, and a laterally elongated tail lamp 543 which also serve as a stop lamp at the lower central position. The reference numerals 545, 545 designate bulbs for the rear turn signal lamp, the numerals 546, 546 designates bulbs for the tail lamp and stop lamp, and the numeral 547 designate a license lamp provided under the rear combination lamp 267.<br>
[0063]<br>
Fig. 19 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 19-19 in Fig. 18, showing a state in which the lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554 of the respective bulbs 545, 546, 546, 545 of the rear combination lamp 267 are respectively inclined with respect to the elongated axes 560... of the vehicle body extending in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle.<br>
[0064]<br>
In other words, the bulbs 545 are oriented in such a manner that the lamp axes 551, 554 are inclined by the angle<br>
a toward the center of the width of the vehicle body with respect to the longitudinal axis 560 of the vehicle body, and the lamps<br><br>
546 are oriented in such a manner that the lamp axes 552, 553 are inclined by the angle β with respect to the longitudinal axis 560 of the vehicle body. The angle |3 is set to be a larger angle of gradient than the angle a, so that the storage box 207 is placed closer to the rear combination lamp 267 to increase the volume of the storage box 207.<br>
[0065]<br>
The lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554 are axes passing through the centers of the screw bases 545a, 546a, 546a, 545a of the bulb 545, 546, 546, 545 respectively.<br>
Therefore, the lamp axes 551, 554 of the two bulbs 545,<br>
545	fan out toward the front, and the lamp axes 552, 553 of<br>
the two bulbs 546, 546 fan out toward the front as well.<br>
[0066]<br>
In this way, by fanning out the lamp axes 551, 554 of the bulbs 545, 545 and the lamp axes 552, 553 of the bulbs 546,<br>
546	respectively, a large massed space 561 can be reserved<br>
between the left and right bulbs 545, 545 and between the left<br>
and right bulbs 546, 546. In other words, a space that can<br>
be utilized more effectively is obtained.<br>
Therefore, the rear portion of the storage box 207 may be extended toward the rear, so that the volume of the storage box 207 may be increased.<br>
[0067]<br>
By inclining the lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554, the bulbs<br><br>
545, 546 may be placed along the outline of the combination lamp 267, and thus the distance between the bulbs 545 and 545 and between the bulbs 546 and 546 may be laterally increased, whereby visibility of the rear combination lamp 267 may be further improved, and the storage 207 can be extended rearwardly of the position between the bulbs 545, 545 so that the volume of the storage box 207 is increased.<br>
[0068]<br>
In addition, by providing the access openings 511, 512 on the rear left wall 207e and the rear right wall 207f of the lower box 207a of the storage box 207, the bulbs 545, 546 may be replaced easily from the inside of the storage box 207 by removing the lids 513, 514. Since the access openings 511, 512 are provided on the left and right sides of the rear portion of the storage box 207, the load exerted by the rearward movement of the stored objects at the time of acceleration of the vehicle on the left and right access openings 511, 512 may be reduced, and thus the access openings 511, 512 may be upsized to improve maintenanceability.<br>
[0069]<br>
The operation of the aforementioned vehicle rear structure will be described below.<br>
Fig. 20 is a first illustration explaining the action of the vehicle rear structure according to the present invention.<br><br>
For example, on burning out, the bulbs 545, 546 of the rear combination lamp 267 may be replaced by placing the finger on the upper catch 532 of the lid 513 and removes the lid 513, inserting the hand into the access opening 511 from inside the storage box 207, holding and turning the screw bases 545a, 546a of the bulb 545, 546 with fingers to release the lock, and taking them out from the access opening 511 as shown by the arrow. Subsequently, the new bulbs 545,546 are mounted in reverse sequence from the abovementioned sequence.<br>
[0070]<br>
In this way, maintenance of the bulbs 545, 546 may easily be performed, and thus it is not necessary to perform maintenance by removing the rear combination lamp by loosening screws, or by inserting the hand via the space between the storage box and the rear combination lamp.<br>
[0071]<br>
Fig. 21 is a second illustration explaining the action of the vehicle rear structure according to the present invention, showing a state in which the back face of the rear combination lamp 267 from the inside of the storage box through the access opening 511 in the direction of the arrow 21 in Fig. 19.<br>

[0074]<br>
By providing the left and right access openings 511, 512 for performing maintenance of the bulbs 545, 546 on the lower box 207a, maintenance work such as replacing the bulbs 545, 546 from the inside of the storage box 207 can easily be performed, and the rear combination lamp 267 can be set closer to the storage box 207, whereby the rear portion of the vehicle may be made compact and slim in configuration even when a large rear combination lamp is disposed rearward of a large storage box.<br>
[0075]<br>
The present invention is secondly characterized in that the lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554 passing through the centers of the respective bulbs 545, 545, 546, 546 are inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis 560 of the vehicle body.<br>
[0076]<br>
By inclining the lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554 with respect to the longitudinal axis 560 of the vehicle body, for example, the lamp axes 551, 552, 553, 554 may be inclined to the direction in which maintenance of the bulbs 545, 546 may easily be performed through the access openings 511, 512. Therefore, maintenanceability is improved.<br>
[0077]<br>
The present invention is thirdly characterized in that the left and right lamp axes 551, 554 and the lamp axes 552, 553 are respectively fanned out toward the front.<br><br><br>
By fanning out the respective left and right lamp axes 551, 554 and the lamp axes 552, 553 toward the front, a large massed space 561 can be reserved between the left and right bulbs 545, 545 and between the left and right bulbs 546, 546 of the rear combination lamp 267, and thus the storage box 207 can be extended toward the rear, so that the volume of the storage box 207 may be increased.<br>
[0078]<br>
Since the lids 513, 514 are provided on the left and right of the storage box 207, for example, even when a rearward load is exerted on the stored objects in the storage box 207 at the time of acceleration of the vehicle, the load does not act on the lids 513, 514. Therefore, in comparison for example with the one having a lid at the rear wall of the storage box, it is not necessary to employ a rigid structure in the lids 513, 514 according to the present invention.<br>
[0079]<br>
Though the lamp axes of the bulbs are inclined in the horizontal plane in the embodiment of the present invention, it is not limited thereto, and the lamp axes of the bulbs may be inclined in the vertical plane as well as in the horizontal plane. Accordingly, the screw bases of the bulbs may be oriented toward the center of the access openings, and thus maintainability of the bulbs may further be increased.<br>
[0080]<br><br>
[Advantages]<br>
The  present  invention  with  the  aforementioned construction will provide the following advantages.<br>
In the vehicle rear structure according to Claim 1, since the rear combination lamp is set closer to the storage box by providing pairs of left and right bulbs on the rear combination lamp and forming the left and right access openings for performing maintenance of these bulbs, and closing these access openings with the lids, maintenance work such as replacing the bulbs from the inside of the storage box can easily be performed, and the rear combination lamp may be set closer to the storage box, whereby the rear portion of the vehicle may be formed compact in configuration even when a large rear combination lamp is disposed rearward of the large storage box.<br>
Therefore, the width or the entire length of the rear portion of the vehicle does not increase, and thus appearance and operationability of the vehicle are improved.<br>
[0081]<br>
In the vehicle rear structure according to Claim 2, since the lamp axes passing through the centers of the bulbs are inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of vehicle body, for example, the lamp axes can be inclined to the orientation in which maintenance work of the bulbs can easily be performed through the access openings. Therefore, workability is improved.<br><br>
[0082]<br>
In the vehicle rear structure according to Claim 3, since the left and right lamp axes are fanned out toward the front, a large space may be reserved between the left and right bulbs of the rear combination lamp, and the storage box can be extended toward the rear, so that the volume of the storage box may be increased.<br>
