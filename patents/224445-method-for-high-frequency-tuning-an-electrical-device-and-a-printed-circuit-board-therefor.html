				<td>The invention relates to a method for RF matching of an electrical of an electrical<br>
arrangement, and to a printed circuit board which is suitable for this purpose.<br>
Disclosure of US 6,023,200 dated February 06,2000 (Rhee) is hereby<br>
incorporated by way of reference.<br>
EP 0 525 703 A1 discloses a plug connected for computer networks in the<br>
domestic area, comprising a male connector part and a female connector part,<br>
with a device for crosstalk compensation being arranged in the plug connection,<br>
by means of which the crosstalk attenuation between the transmission<br>
conductor loop and the reception conductor loop can be increased. For this<br>
purpose, a printed circuit board is arranged in the female connector part or in<br>
the male connector part of the plug connection between the connections for the<br>
plug-in cable and the connections for the wiring, with the conductor routes for<br>
the transmission and reception conductor loops being largely physically<br>
separated on the printed circuit board. The devices for crosstalk compensation<br>
are, for example, discrete components such as capacitors or coils, which are<br>
adjustable . The known plug connection has the disadvantage that the discrete<br>
components are relatively expensive and large.<br>
DE 100 51 097 Al discloses an electrical plug connector comprising a plug<br>
connector housing, a printed circuit board with two sets of contact elements,<br>
with the first set of contact elements being arranged on the front face of the<br>
printed circuit board and projecting into an opening in the plug connector<br>
housing, and the second set of contact elements being arranged on the rear face<br>
of the printed circuit board, and the contact elements in the second set being in<br>
the form of insulation-displacement contacts, with the plug<br>
connector having a cable manager which has an opening<br>
through it and is provided on the front face with<br>
guides for conductors which are intended to make<br>
contact with the insulation-displacement contacts, with<br>
the guides being formed in the area of the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts with recessed holders for the<br>
insulation-displacement contacts, and in which case the<br>
cable manager can be matched to the plug connector<br>
housing.<br>
Owing to the increasing bandwidth for data transmission<br>
in telecommunications and information technology, the<br>
conductors, contacts and conductor tracks have to be<br>
designed such that they are highly defined with respect<br>
to one another, in order to comply with the required<br>
values for the crosstalk attenuation.<br>
This necessitates extremely tight tolerances, which can<br>
be complied with only with difficulty during automated<br>
manufacturing processes.<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical problem of<br>
providing a method for matching an RF plug connector,<br>
in particular an RJ-45 female connector, having at<br>
least one printed circuit board, with the printed<br>
circuit board having contact points for RF contacts and<br>
contact points for the insulation-displacement<br>
contacts, and with one contact point for the RF<br>
contacts in each case being connected to a respective<br>
contact point for the insulation-displacement contacts,<br>
and a printed circuit board which is suitable for this<br>
purpose and by means of which the RF characteristics<br>
can be adjusted within a narrow tolerance band.<br>
The technical problem is solved by the subject matters<br>
with the features of patent claims 1 and .11. Further<br>
advantageous refinements of the invention are described<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
For this purpose, at least one first conductor track,<br>
which is connected on only one side to a contact point<br>
of an electrical contact, is arranged on the printed<br>
circuit board and, together with at least one second<br>
conductor track which is arranged on or in the printed<br>
circuit board, forms a capacitor, with at least one<br>
frequency-dependent parameter of the arrangement being<br>
measured, the frequency-dependent parameter being<br>
compared with a nominal parameter, and the conductor<br>
track with which contact is made on one side being<br>
partially removed or cut through as a function of the<br>
difference, This makes it possible to form a matchable<br>
capacitor using simple and cost-effective means, and by<br>
means of which the RF response of the arrangement can<br>
be matched. The conductor tracks are in this case<br>
preferably connected to the contact points of the RF<br>
contacts, since this means that the matching<br>
capacitances are closer to the location of the source<br>
of the crosstalk. However, in principle, they may also<br>
be connected to the contact points of the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts, which are electrically connected<br>
to the contact points of the RF contacts. It should be<br>
noted that, in principle, it is sufficient to cut<br>
through or to remove one conductor track of a capacitor<br>
in order to change the capacitance.<br>
The opposite electrode of the capacitor is preferably<br>
likewise formed by a conductor track that is connected<br>
to a contact point on one side.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, at least one further<br>
second conductor track is"" arranged in an internal layer<br>
in the printed circuit board and is electrically<br>
connected to the conductor track on the printed circuit<br>
board. This represents capacitances " connected in<br>
parallel, so that the total capacitance is added, thus<br>
allowing the formation of a sufficiently large<br>
capacitance on a relatively small area.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, at least two<br>
independent capacitors which are formed by. conductor<br>
tracks are arranged on the printed circuit board, in<br>
order to carry out symmetrical trimming with respect to<br>
ground.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the frequency-<br>
dependent parameter is determined and adjusted on the<br>
unpopulated printed circuit board. This is based on the<br>
knowledge that, particularly in the case of RF plug<br>
connectors, the printed circuit board itself is<br>
responsible for the majority of the RF tolerances.<br>
These tolerances are generally geometric tolerances of<br>
the layout elements, such as conductor tracks, and<br>
tolerances of the dielectric constant of the material<br>
of the printed circuit board. Automatic measurement on<br>
an unpopulated printed circuit board is considerably<br>
easier than on a populated printed circuit board, or<br>
even on a printed circuit board that has been installed<br>
in a housing. The overall arrangement can thus be<br>
matched even at an early stage in the process of<br>
producing the printed circuit board. The feed and<br>
measurement are in this case preferably provided<br>
centrally in soldered eyes of the contact points.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, only a portion of<br>
the estimated conductor track shortening that is<br>
necessary is carried out in a first step. The<br>
frequency-dependent parameter is then measured once<br>
again. The measured change is then used to determine<br>
the remaining conductor track length that is still to<br>
be removed or to be cut. This also takes account of the<br>
tolerances relating to the conductor tracks in the<br>
matching process. The conductor track shortening can in<br>
this case also be subdivided into more than two steps.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the final cut during<br>
the cutting of the conductor track is carried out in a<br>
broader manner than the first cut. This broader cut<br>
minimizes the capacitive influence of the cut part of<br>
the conductor track.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the near crosstalk<br>
is determined as the frequency-dependent parameter,<br>
thus making the matching process easier, since the<br>
parameter to be optimised directly is determined, so<br>
that there is no need for any further estimates of the<br>
influence of the parameter on the near crosstalk as<br>
would be the case, for example, with pure capacitance<br>
measurement.<br>
The conductor track is preferably cut by means of a<br>
laser,preferably by means of a short-wave laser with a<br>
wavelength that is shorter than 600 nm. The use of a<br>
laser for cutting the conductor track is extremely<br>
fast, and can easily be automated. In principle, the<br>
conductor track can also be cut or removed<br>
mechanically, for example by means of milling or<br>
electrically by using an overcurrent to burn through<br>
it.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the laser has an<br>
associated optical positioning system. This results in<br>
the conductor track being cut in a more defined manner,<br>
without any damage to closely adjacent conductor tracks<br>
and without the conductor track to be cut not being cut<br>
completely.<br>
During removal or cutting of the conductor track, it is<br>
possible for copper particles to be deposited on the<br>
printed circuit board, and these in turn reduce the<br>
resistance to overvoltages. The cutting or removal of<br>
the conductor track is thus preferably followed by a<br>
cleaning step to remove the copper particles and/or any<br>
other contamination.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the<br>
following text with reference to a preferred exemplary<br>
embodiment. In the figure:<br>
Figure 1 shows an exploded illustration of a plug<br>
ponnector for transmitting RF data (prior<br>
art),<br>
Figure 2 shows a printed circuit board for use in a<br>
plug connector shown in Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic equivalent circuit, for the<br>
printed circuit board,<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic frequency response for the<br>
near crosstalk and<br>
characteristics<br>
Figure 5 shows a family of for the attenuation<br>
D of the near crosstalk as a function of the<br>
length of the conductor track to be removed.<br>
Figure 1 shows an exploded illustration of a plug<br>
connector 1. The plug connector 1 has a plug connector<br>
housing, 2, a printed circuit board 3, a hold-down<br>
device 4 and a cable manager 5. The plug connector<br>
housing 2 in the illustrated example is in the form of<br>
a female connector housing with various latching and<br>
insertion means. The plug connector housing 2 has a<br>
shielding plate 6 on the side surfaces. The printed<br>
circuit board 3 is fitted on its front face with a<br>
first set of contacts 7, and is fitted on its rear face<br>
with a second set of insulation-displacement contacts<br>
8. One contact 7 in the first set is connected to a<br>
respective contact 8 in the second set. The printed<br>
circuit board 3 is then inserted into the plug<br>
connector housing 2. In the process, cylindrical pins 9<br>
of the plug connector housing 2 pass through holes in<br>
the printed circuit board 3, so that the plug connector<br>
housing 2 and the printed circuit board 3 are adjusted<br>
and fixed with respect to one another. The contacts 7<br>
(which are in the form of RF contacts) in the first set<br>
then project into an opening which is accessible from<br>
the front face of the plug connector housing. The hold-<br>
down device 4 is then pushed over the contacts 8 in the<br>
second set, and is latched to the plug connector<br>
housing 2. For this purpose, the hold-down device 4 has<br>
latching tabs 10 on the end face, and has openings 11<br>
through it for the insulation-displacement contacts 8.<br>
Furthermore, the hold-down device 4 has two latching<br>
hooks 12, which are used for latching to the cable<br>
manager 5.<br>
Figure 2 shows the unpopulated printed circuit board 3.<br>
The printed circuit board 3 has eight contact points<br>
21 - 28 and contact holes for the RF contacts, and<br>
eight contact points 31 - 38 for the insulation-<br>
displacement contacts. The printed circuit board 3 also<br>
has further plated-through holes 40 for connection of<br>
conductor tracks on the front face and rear face and<br>
internal layers in the printed circuit board, with the<br>
plated-through holes 40 being illustrated as small<br>
circles. The holes 41 in the printed circuit board 3<br>
are in this case illustrated as small squares. The<br>
conductor tracks which connect the contact points 21 -<br>
28 to their respectively associated contact point 31 -<br>
38 are not shown, with the exception of two parts of<br>
the contact points 24 and 35 since they are arranged on<br>
the rear face and/in the internal layers of the printed<br>
circuit board. In addition to the electrically<br>
connected conductor tracks between two contact points<br>
21 - 28 and 31 - 38, respectively, there are also four<br>
conductor tracks 43 - 46 which are respectively<br>
connected on one side to a contact point 23 - 26. In<br>
this case, the two conductor tracks 44 and 46 form a<br>
capacitor between the contact points 24 and 26. In a<br>
corresponding way, the two conductor tracks 43 and 45<br>
form a capacitor between the contact points 23 and 25.<br>
A further conductor track is preferably arranged in an<br>
internal layer, is electrically connected to conductor<br>
track 44, and is located under the conductor track 46.<br>
For circuitry purposes, the contact points 21, 22; 23,<br>
26; 24, 25 and 27, 28 and their respectively associated<br>
contacts form a contact pair. In this case, the two<br>
outer contact pairs 21, 22 and 27, 28 are relatively<br>
uncritical with regard to near crosstalk. The two inner<br>
and interleaved contact pairs 23, 26 and 24, 25, on the<br>
other hand, are problematic. The capacitances which<br>
cause disturbances in this case are located between 23<br>
and 24 as well as between 25 and 26, since the other<br>
couplings are negligible, owing to the greater<br>
distances between them.<br>
Figure 3 shows the resultant equivalent circuit,<br>
including the schematic test layout. In this case, the<br>
capacitors C46 and C35 essentially represent capacitors<br>
formed by the conductor tracks 44 and 46 as well as 43<br>
and 45, respectively, while, in contrast, the<br>
capacitors C34 and C56, respectively, are formed by the<br>
adjacent contact points 23, 33 as well as the<br>
associated conductor track, 24, 34 with the conductor<br>
track as well as 25, 35 with the conductor track, and<br>
26, 36 with the conductor track. This bridge circuit<br>
can now be trimmed in order to force the near crosstalk<br>
below the required values. Before the trimming process,<br>
the asymmetry is first of all determined by determining<br>
the near crosstalk of one contact pair as a frequency-<br>
dependent parameter. In the present case, crosstalk is<br>
determined between the contact pair 23, 33 and 26, 36<br>
and the contact pair 24, 34; 25, 35. Since the<br>
measurement is preferably carried out on the<br>
unpopulated printed circuit board 3, the contact points<br>
33 - 36 are terminated with the correct impedance. The<br>
near crosstalk to the contact points 25, 24 is then<br>
measured, with RF signals being injected into the<br>
contact points 23, 26, by means of a network analyzer<br>
which is symbolized in Figure 3 by the frequency<br>
generator 50 and the measurement device 51. The feeding<br>
and measurement of the RF signals are in this case<br>
provided by means of a central contact in the solder<br>
eyes of the contact points 23 - 26.<br>
Figure 4 schematically shows the frequency response of<br>
the near, crosstalk NEXT, with the profile a<br>
representing nominal near crosstalk, and the profile b<br>
representing the measured actual near crosstalk for a<br>
measured printed circuit board. The nominal near<br>
crosstalk is determined, for example, by means of a<br>
golden device. In this case, the measured near<br>
crosstalk is too high by an amount A NEXT, so that this<br>
must be compensated for by shortening the conductor<br>
tracks, thus reducing the capacitance. The measure of<br>
how many millimeters of conductor track correspond to<br>
what capacitance and thus to the near crosstalk<br>
attenuation D depends on the tolerances of the printed<br>
circuit board, such as the dielectric constant or the<br>
distance between the conductor tracks. There is<br>
therefore no single straight line, but an entire family<br>
of characteristics, as is illustrated schematically in Figure 5.<br>
Since the tolerances are unknown, it may first of all<br>
characteristics<br>
be necessary to determine which characteristics is applicable to<br>
the printed circuit board to be matched. For this<br>
purpose, a piece of conductor track is first of all<br>
removed or cut through, and the measurements are then<br>
carried out once again. The increase in the attenuation<br>
D that is found can then be used to determine the<br>
associated characteristics. If, on the other hand, the desired<br>
attenuation is greater than that which can be achieved<br>
with the steepest Iradient, the entire conductor track can<br>
be removed or cut through without any intermediate<br>
step. The method is then repeated on the other<br>
capacitor.<br>
The conductor track is preferably cut through by means<br>
of a short-wave laser, whose power and focusing are<br>
matched to the copper track to be cut such that, as far<br>
as possible, this is all that is removed. The advantage<br>
of a laser is its high speed with good reproducibility,<br>
so that the matching process can easily be automated.<br>
