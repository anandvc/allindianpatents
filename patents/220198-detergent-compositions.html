				<td>Detergent Compositions Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to bleach-containing detergents. This technology may find an application in laundry detergent compositions, soaking detergent compositions, or any other compositions for household applications or the like.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When detergent products are stored in a geographical location that has a hot and/or humid climate, an industrial environment, a household environment, or any combination thereof, where a high temperature and a high relative humidity are prevalent, it has been found that the mean particle size of the detergent composition increases during storage of the product. This increase in mean particle size, gives the product a coarse appearance of an aged product, which is not acceptable to the consumers, especially when the product is of a hand-wash application.<br>
For many years, the laundry industry have been trying to determine the cause of this mean particle size increase of the detergent composition, with little success. However, the inventors have now successfully identified the cause of this mean particle size increase of the detergent composition during storage.<br>
The laundry industry have been using perborate as a source of available oxygen in granular bleach-containing detergent compositions for use in hot or humid environments. The inclusion of a bleaching system in a granular detergent formulation helps to improve the cleaning performance of the detergent and is common practice in the laundry industry.<br>
The inventors have found that in granular bleach-containing detergent compositions, it is the perborate that causes the increase in the mean particle size of the detergent composition during storage in conditions of high temperature and high relative humidity. Whilst not intending to be bound by theory, it is thought that in these conditions, sodium perborate monohydrate is hydrated to sodium perborate tetrahydrate. Sodium perborate tetrahydrate forms a gel that binds other detergent ingredients, thus forming detergent components of an irregular and increased size. This increase in the mean particle size of the detergent components results in a product that is of coarse appearance and not acceptable to the consumers.<br>
The inventors have suprisingly found that when selected sodium percarbonate is used instead of sodium perborate as a source of available oxygen in a granular bleach-containing detergent composition with a bulk density of less than 570g/l, the problem of increasing particle sizes is alleviated. It has been found that when such products are stored under hot and/or humid conditions, for example, after being simultaneously exposed to 32°C and 80% relative humidity for 24 hours, the detergent composition retains its main particle size, in that it has a mean particle size of 100% to 130% of the original mean particle size. This results in a product that remains attractive to the consumer, which is of great benefit to the laundry industry and is especially applicable to handwash applications.<br>
Also, the inventors have found that, after storage in such, the detergent composition retains its bulk density, in that it has a bulk density of 90% to 100% of the original bulk density. This results in a product that can still be effectively and accurately dosed during the washing process.<br>
By using specifically selected sodium percarbonate in detergent compositions, namely sodium percarbonate which comprises less than 2% by weight chloride ions or sodium percarbonate prepared by a fluidised bed process, the inventors have found that detergent compositions comprising said sodium percarbonate are particularly stable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides a granular bleach-containing detergent composition with a bulk density of less than 570g/l, characterised in that the detergent composition comprises a percarbonate source, and that, after being openly exposed simultaneously to 32°C and 80% relative humidity for 24 hours, the detergent composition has a mean particle size of 100% to 130% of the original mean particle size.<br>
The invention also provides a granular bleach-containing detergent composition with a bulk density of less than 570g/l comprising a percarbonate source and less than 0.06% by weight extractable suds suppressing silicone, where the percarbonate source comprises a salt of percarbonate, characterised in that percarbonate source comprises less than 2% by weight chloride ions.<br>
The invention is applicable to detergent compositions that are stored in a climate comprising conditions of high temperature and high relative moisture content.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Detergent Composition<br>

The granular bleach-containing detergent composition comprises a percarbonate source that comprises a salt of percarbonate, preferably sodium percarbonate, although in addition other forms of percarbonate can also be comprised by the percarbonate source of the invention. Also, in addition to percarbonate, other sources of available oxygen known in the art, or a combination thereof, can be included in the granular detergent composition, although it is preferred that percarbonate is the only perhydrate component<br>
included in the granular detergent composition. Mean particle size<br>
The mean particle size of the detergent composition is the mean particle size of all of the particles that the detergent composition comprises.<br>
The granular detergent composition comprises a percarbonate source and optionally additional detergent ingredients. When the granular detergent composition is exposed to conditions of 32°C and 80% relative humidity for 24 hours, after exposure to these conditions, the detergent composition has a mean particle size of 100% to 130%, preferably 100% to 120%, more preferably 100% to 110% of the original mean particle size.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, this is determined by the following:<br>

The detergent composition was exposed to these said conditions in the incubator for 24 hours.<br>
The mean particle size is determined before and after the detergent composition was exposed to the said conditions. The mean particle size of the detergent composition is measured using the method ISO 3118 (1976), where lOOg of product is used to determine the mean particle size, the sieve sizes that are used are 250, 425, 600, 850,1180 and 2000 micrometers, and the time the product is allowed in the sieves before the mean particle<br>
size is measured is 5 minutes. See example 1. Bulk density<br>
The granular detergent composition comprises a blown powder, a percarbonate source, and additional detergent ingredients, and has a bulk density less than 570g/l. When the detergent composition is stored in conditions of 32°C and 80% relative humidity for 8 weeks, after storage in these conditions, the detergent composition has a bulk density of 90% to 100% of the original bulk density.<br>

The detergent composition was stored in these said conditions for 8 weeks.<br>

A detergent composition used to determine the mean particle size (MPS) is described hereinbefore (see detailed description of the invention, mean particle size). The mean particle size of a detergent composition comprising 10% by weight sodium perborate monohydrate (sodium perborate sample) is also shown, along with two detergent compositions comprising 10% by weight sodium percarbonate (sodium percarbonate sample 1 and 2, see below for a more detailed description) before (Oh) and after exposure for 24 hours (24h) to conditions of 32°C and 80% relative humidity by the method described hereinbefore (see detailed description of the invention, mean particle size).<br>
The sodium percarbonate sample 1 comprises a coated sodium percarbonate comprising or with 4.5% by weight sodium carbonate and/or sodium sulphate and prepared by a crystalline/classification process, ex Solvay.<br>
