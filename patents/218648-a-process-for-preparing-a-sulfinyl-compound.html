PHARMACEUTICAL PROCESS AND COMPOUNDS PREPARED THEREBY<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of proton pump inhibitors, and to such proton pump inhibitors prepared thereby, compositions containing the same and uses thereof.<br>
Gastric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include substituted 2-(2-pyridylmemyl)-sulfinyl-lH-<br>
benzimidazoles, such as lansoprazole (2-[[[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-2-<br>
pyridinyl]methyl]sutfinyl] lH-benzimidazole), omeprazole (5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-<br>
dmethyl-2-pyirdyl)memyl]suhinyl]-lH-benzimidazole), pantoprazole (5-{difluoromethoxy)-<br>
2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridiny) methyl] 1H-bezimidazale), and rabeprazole (2-[[[4-<br>
(3-methoxy-propoxy)3-metbyl-2-pyridmyl]methyl] sulfinyl]-1H –bezimidazole) 	These<br>
compounds can produce profound and sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion, with responses of PPIs being more rapid compared with those seen with other anti-secretory drugs. PPIs work by inhibiting the production of stomach acid, by shutting down a system in the stomach known as proton pump, the full name of which is the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphate enzyme system. PPIs are the drugs of choice in dyspepsia and peptic ulcers, and also Zollinger-Ellyson syndrome. In particular, in the treatment of peptic ulcers, the response rates of PPIs are superior to those seen with other drugs.<br>
The reported prior art synthesis of these substituted 2-(2-pyridylmethyl)-sulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles generally involves an oxidation process of a sulfide compound to the corresponding sulfinyl compound. More particularly, prior art processes for the preparation of 2-(2-pyridylmemyl)-sulky-lH-benzimidazoles, generally involve the synthesis of the corresponding throatier compound, and its subsequent oxidation to the sulfinyl or sulfoxy compound, by various methods such as reaction with hydrogen peroxide over a vanadium compound catalyst, or reaction with peracids, peresters or ozone. There are several disadvantages associated with such known processes, primarily with respect to the nature of the thioether (or sulfide) compound being oxidized.<br><br>
WO 2004/063188<br><br>
PCT/GB2004/000064<br><br>
3<br>
US Patent No. 4,628,098 to Nohara, et al. discloses a process for preparation of lansoprazole by oxidation of the sulphide precursor compound using peracids (m-chloro perbenzoic acid).<br>
US Patent No. 5,840,552 to Holt, et al. discloses a process for preparation of lansoprazole, wherein the sulphide precursor compound was selectively bio-oxidised to isolate the pharmaceuticalry active enantiomer or enantiomerically enriched corresponding sulfoxide form, using microorganisms or a microbial enzyme system.<br>
US Patent No. 5,374,730, to Slemon, et al. discloses a process for the preparation of omeprazole and lansoprazole, wherein amide analogues of the thioether compounds were readily oxidized to the corresponding sulfinyl compounds and the sulfinyl compounds were hydrolyzed in an alkaline medium to the corresponding carboxylic acid salts. The salts were subsequently decarboxylated to omeprazole or lansoprazole respectively. The disclosure refers to the advantages in relation to the purity of the final products, and the simplicity of the purification procedures. The amide compounds which were subjected to the oxidation step were crystalline solids, as opposed to oils, and as such could be readily purified to a high degree of purity by relatively simple precipitation, crystallization and washing procedures. The carboxylates and carboxylic acid salts which were formed in the subsequent synthetic step after oxidation were water soluble, whereas the final products, omeprazole and lansoprazole, are not water soluble. Accordingly, any un-reacted residues, and also other minor impurities in the final products, were simply removable by an aqueous washing procedure. Avoidance of significant discoloration of the product was the other advantage disclosed.<br>
US Patent No. 5,470,983 to Slemon, et al. discloses processes for producing lansoprazole from acetamide-sulfide compounds by a process of oxidation to form the amide sulfinyl compound, followed by alkaline hydrolysis to the sulfinyl carboxylate or salt, and decarboxylation.<br>
US Patent No. 5,502,195, to Slemon, et al. discloses a process for preparation of lansoprazole, wherein the acetamide sulphide was oxidized to the corresponding amide sulfinyl compound, which was subsequently hydrolysed in an alkaline medium to the carboxylic acid salt and then decarboxylated to form lansoprazole.<br><br>
WO 2004/063188	PCT/GB2004/000064<br>
4-<br>
US Patent No. 6,423,846 to Moon, et al. discusses problems associated with prior art oxidation procedures for converting precursor compounds into lansoprazole, where many by products were formed and the yield of lansoprazole was low. EP Patent No. 134,400, GB Patent No. 2,134,523, US Patent No. 4,628,098 and Korean Patent No. 52,837 each disclose m-chloroperbenzoic acid as the oxidant. Spanish Patent Nos. 550,057; 540,147 and 539,793 respectively disclose sodium penodate, iodosomethylbenzene and iodosobenzene as the oxidant employed. These prior art processes were cited as being unviable because of the expensive oxidants used therein, the formation of many impurities and a low yield of the product in the range of about 60 to 80%.<br>
All these prior art process either use expensive catalysts or hazardous oxidizing reagents, such as peracids, which are not suitable for commercial manufacture of these compounds. Also over-oxidation of the thioether compound to the corresponding sulphone analogue is a common problem encountered with the prior art processes.<br>
to a sulfinyl compound of formula (I)<br>
There has thus been a long felt need for efficient and safe methods for the selective oxidation of a sulphide compound of formula (II)<br><br><br>
WO 2004/063188<br><br>
PCT/GB2004/000064<br><br><br><br>
wherein in both formulae (I) and (Q) R1 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl or C1-4alkoxy, R2 is selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstantiated C1-4 alkoxy and R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or substituted or unsubstantiated C1-4alkoxy.<br>
The present invention now provides an efficient, safe and industrially feasible method for preparing various substituted 2-(2-pyridylme1hyl)-sulfinyl-lH-beri2drnida2oles.<br>
In particular, it is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved process for<br>
oxidation	of	(2-[[[3-methyM-(2,2,2-trifluoro-emoxy&gt;2-pyridinyl]methyI]thio]lH-<br>
benzimtdazole to the corresponding (2-[[[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-2-pyridinyl]methyl]-sulfinyl]lH-benzimidazoIe (lansoprazole), preferably using an eco-friendly, inexpensive and readily available reagent.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention is to provide an improved process for oxidation of<br>
((5-methoxy-2-[[(4-memoxy-3,5-dlmethyl-2provide)methyl]-thio]-1H-benzimidazole, to the<br>
corresponding	((5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyirdryl)methyl]-sulfinl]-IH-<br>
benzimidazole (omeprazole), preferably using an eco-friendly, inexpensive and readily available reagent.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention is to provide an improved process for oxidation of<br>
((5-difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dlmethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl]thio]1H-benzimidazole,	to the<br>
corresponding       ((5<dffluoromethoxy preferably using an eco-friendly inexpensive and readily available reagent.></dffluoromethoxy><br>
WO 2004/063188<br><br>
PCT/GB2004/000064<br><br>
6-<br>
It is a still further aim of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
oxidation	of	(2-[[[4-(3-methoxy-propoxy)3-methyl-2-pyridmyl]methyl]-thio]-lH-<br>
benzimidazole,	to     the     corresponding     (2-[[[4-(3-methoxy-propoxy)3-methyl-2-<br>
pyridinyl]methyl]-sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole   (rabeprazole),      preferably  using   an   eco-friendly, inexpensive and readily available reagent.<br>
which process comprises oxidation of a sulfide compound of formula (II)<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a sulfinyl compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof,<br><br><br>
wherein in both formulae (I) and (II) R1 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl or C1 alkoxy, R2 is selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted Cwalkoxy and R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted Cwalkoxy,<br>
wherein a compound of formula (D) is added to a solvent, or a mixture of solvents, to form a reaction mixture, an oxidizing agent is added to said reaction mixture and said oxidation is<br><br>
WO 2004/063188	PCT/GB2004/000064<br>
7<br>
carried out at a controlled temperature and pH so as to prepare a compound of formula (I), and optionally converting a sulfinyl compound of formula (I) to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof;<br>
characterised in that an alkali is present in the reaction mixture at least during said oxidation, whereby the pH of the reaction mixture at least during said oxidation is in the range of 9 to 12. Preferably the oxidizing agent comprises an aqueous hypohalite solution.<br>
which process comprises oxidation of a sulfide compound of formula (Q)<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a sulfinyl compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof,<br><br><br>
wherein in both formulae (I) and (II) R1 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl or C1 aikoxy, R2 is selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted C1 alkoxy and R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted C1 alkoxy;<br><br>
WO 2004/063188	PCT/GB2004/000064<br>
8<br>
characterised in that said compound of formula (II) is reacted with an oxidizing agent comprising an aqueous hypohalite solution, and optionally converting a sulfinyl compound of formula (I) to a suitable pharmaceuticalry acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof<br>
Optionally, a compound of formula (H) is reacted with an aqueous hypohalite solution in the presence of a catalyst, suitably selected from the group consisting of pyridine, di-isopropyl ethyl amine and N,N-dimethyl amino pyridine. The use of such a catalyst is desirable to further avoid formation of undesirable by products.<br>
Typically, a process according to the present invention comprises dissolving or suspending a sulphide precursor compound of formula (II) in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents. Suitably, the solvent comprises water, lower alkyl alcohols, esters, ethers, chlorinated solvents, or mixtures thereof. A preferred solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, di-isopropyl ether, dichloromethane, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents. An aqueous hypohalite solution, preferably sodium hypochlorite, is then added slowly in a controlled manner at appropriate temperature conditions to give, after simple work up procedures, a sulfinyl compound of formula (T) in very high yield and purity.<br>
A process according to the present invention is typically performed at a temperature in the range of-30 to 50°C. A preferred operating temperature is in the range of 0 to 30°C.<br>
An aqueous hypohalite solution suitable for use in a process according to the present invention typically comprises an aqueous solution of an alkali metal or alkali earth metal hypohalite and is preferably selected from the group consisting of sodium hypochlorite, sodium hypobromite and calcium hypochlorite. Sodium hypochlorite is most preferred. An aqueous hypohalite solution suitable for use in a process according to the present invention typically has a concentration in the range of 2% to 30%. It is preferable, however, to use an aqueous hypohalite solution having a concentration in the range of 2% to 5%, for ease of handling.<br><br>
WO 2004/063188	PCT/GB2004/000064<br>
°l<br>
The aqueous hypohalite solution is typically added to a reaction mixture comprising a sulphide precursor compound of formula (II) dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent, or mixture of solvents, over a time period ranging from several minutes to several hours, depending on the strength of the hypohalite solution and the exothermicity of the reaction. It is preferable to perform the addition slowly over a period ranging from 30 minutes to 4 hours, with the time taken for completion of the reaction ranging from 2 to 10 hours.<br>
A commercially available hypohalite solution can be employed, but it is advantageous to use a freshly prepared solution typically including about 0.5 % to 5 % of free corresponding alkali or alkali earth metal hydroxide. The presence of free alkah or alkali earth metal hydroxide not only stabilizes the hypohalite, but also exhibits an advantageous stabilising effect on the benzimidazole sulphinyl products which are known to be unstable in acidic conditions. Alternatively, a solution of an alkah or alkah earth metal hydroxide, or other suitable alkali, can be added to the suspension or solution of a precursor sulphide compound of formula (II) in the solvent, or mixture of solvents, before addition of the oxidizing agent.<br>
A sulfinyl compound of formula (I) can be suitably isolated from the reaction mass by adjusting the pH using aqueous organic or inorganic acids. Typically, the pH is adjusted to be in the range of 6.0 to 9.5, more preferably in the range of 7 to 7.5, using aqueous acetic acid, followed by filtration to isolate a sulfinyl compound of formula (I).<br>
A sulfinyl compound of formula (I) may be further purified by dissolving in a mixture of a CM alkanol, typically methanol, and an aqueous alkah metal hydroxide solution, typically sodium hydroxide solution. The pH of the resulting clear solution is adjusted to between 9.0 to 9.5, typically using aqueous ammonium acetate solution, and a sulfinyl compound of formula (I) is isolated by filtration.<br>
Substantially as hereinbefore described a process according to the present invention can further comprise conversion of a sulfinyl compound of formula (I) to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof in particular a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Suitable salts include those with alkali or alkyl earth metals, for example Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K* or Li+ salts, in particular Mg2* or Na+ salts.<br><br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation    of   2-[[[4-(3-methoxy-propoxy-propoxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]    methyl]-sulfinyl]-lH-<br>
benzimidazole sodium (rabeprazole sodium)<br>
2-[[[4-(3-methoxy-propoxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]methyl]-1H-benzimidazole 	(10g)<br>
was suspended in 200ml of purified water, sodium hydroxide (about 2g) and pyridine (4ml). To this was slowly added about 75g of approximately 3.8% sodium hypochlorite solution in 2 hours. The reaction mass was maintained at 5 - 8° C for 4 hours. After completion of the reaction, excess sodium hypochlorite was decomposed using 5% aqueous sodium thiosulphate solution. The pH was adjusted to between 8.0 to 9.0 using 10% ammonium acetate solution.<br>
After pH adjustment the compound was isolated from the water layer by adding ethyl acetate followed by extraction. Concentrating the organic layer under vacuum yielded a residue to which isopropyl acetate was added and stirred for about 1 hour, yielding the desired product. The product was purified by dissolving in a mixture of acetone and triethylamine. Rabeprazole base so obtained was dissolved in ethyl acetate and methanolic ammonia mixture to which methanolic sodium hydroxide was added and distilled off to a thick residue at low temperature.
