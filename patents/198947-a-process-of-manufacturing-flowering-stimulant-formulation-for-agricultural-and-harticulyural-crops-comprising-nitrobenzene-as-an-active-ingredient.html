The invention pertains to a process of manufacturing flowering stimulant formulation for Agricultural and Horticultural crops. This invention precisely relates to a novel process for preparing FLOWERING STIMULANT composition comprising Nitrobenzene from 1% to 99% as an active ingredient and carrier at the predetermined Ratio.wherein the process consists of Nitrobenzene as an active ingredient with Natural, Synthetic / ionic / non-ionic surfactant base along with petro / non-petro solvent base in Liquid / Wettable Powder / Granular forms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Increasing the flowering of plants is of considerable importance in the field of Horticulture and Agriculture, since increased flowering means increased flower crop in Agriculture and Horticulture, increased flowering would result in increased fruiting, which again means a better atop in Agriculture and Horticulture. There is no known prior art for increasing flowering in plants particulariy. Hitherto the prior arii was limited to using chemical and organic fertilizers in Agriculture and Horticulture which would result in overall increasing of the plant, flowering, quality and ultimately, yield. But there is a limitation to the use of the fertilizers and compost because of the law of diminishing retums. Fertilizers will increase vegetative growth also along with flowering and fruiting. Therefore flowering and fruiting do not take place to their peak levels.<br>

Sodium Hydroxide	-	1 to 2 kg<br>
Nitrobenzene	-	20 to 22 kg<br>
Urea	-	2 to 4 kg<br>
Water	-	65 to 70 kg<br>
(Filler &amp; Stabilizer)<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESS:<br>
a) 8 kgs to 10 kgs of Acid Slurry is neutralized with 1 to 2 kgs Sodium Hydroxide to obtain a liquid surfactant base<br><br>
b)	After neutralization of the liquid surfactant base, it is bleached from dark colour to honey colour with Urea 2 kgs to 4 kgs.<br>
c)	After making up the liquid sur^ctant base with desired quantity of water to obtain a volume of 80 litres, the chemical composition is allowed to get cured sufficiently and brought to room temperature.<br>
d)	21 kgs of Nitrobenzene is added for every 80 lits of lk|uid surfactant base and allowed to get absorbed fully by repeated stirring to obtain a flowering stimulant composition with Nitrobenzene 20% v/v.<br>
CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE PROCESS:<br>
&gt;	Neutralization of the composition.<br>
&gt;	Exo &amp; Endothermic reaction should be carefully followed and manage.<br>
