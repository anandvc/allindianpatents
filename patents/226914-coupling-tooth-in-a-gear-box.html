				<td>Coupling Tooth in a Gear Box <br>
The invention relates to a coupling tooth formation, in particular in a gear box,<br>
either on a gear sleeve or on a gear wheel, the teeth of which are positioned<br>
at a cylindrical base in relation to the rotational axis, elongate in axial<br>
direction and provided at their coupling end with a roof contour sloping from<br>
the tooth base towards the tooth head, comprising a rounded roof edge.<br>
Gear sleeves are known (DE 19604386 A1, DE 19531155 A1) the teeth of<br>
which comprise roof-shaped surfaces which together form a rounded edge.<br>
Furthermore, symmetrical and asymmetrical roof configurations are known<br>
and those having a sloping roof contour; the latter serves to additionally<br>
facilitate tracking of the two teeth partners of a set of coupling teeth. In this<br>
context it is the object of the person skilled in the art to attain that during the<br>
initial contact of the two tooth formations their contact is reduced to a<br>
minimum of points or lines; this permits the friction-reduced and, therefore,<br>
smooth-running interlocking of both tooth formation partners of a set of<br>
coupling teeth. However, in this process still too little attention is paid to the<br>
further procedure of the tracking process, that is to say, after the initial<br>
contact has already taken place. This is where the present invention sets in<br>
by pursuing the object of realising the smoothest possible transition in the<br>
phase between the initial contact and the final coupling position.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention in that the radius of the roof<br>
edge rounding increases from the tooth base towards the tooth head<br>
according to a pre-set function.<br>
This measure results in a continuous increase of the contact points or the<br>
extension of the contact lines until finally the desired surface contact is<br>
attained between the power transmitting tooth flanges. During the initial<br><br>
contact, i.e. in the proximity of the foot region with a correspondingly greater<br>
tooth depth, the tooth formation offers a particularly great tolerance for the<br>
mutual engagement, as the radius of the roof edge rounding is relatively<br>
small there. With an increasing engagement, i.e. increasing axial shifting of<br>
the two interlocking teeth, an increasing centring of the two teeth formations<br>
in relation to one another is brought about according to the widening of the<br>
roof edge in the tooth head region due to the relatively larger radii there of<br>
the roof edge rounding, until their maximum contact is realised upon reaching<br>
complete engagement.<br>
In the process, the person operating the gear box, gets the impression of a<br>
smoother gear changing procedure as if, after the initial contact, the switched<br>
gear is put in quasi automatically. This impression is further strengthened if<br>
the increase in radius proceeds progressively, e.g. according to an<br>
exponential function or a circular function instead of a linear function.<br>
A particularly advantageous progression from the foot cylinder towards the<br>
head cylinder of the tooth formation defines an altogether six-fold increase of<br>
the radius in which context doubling is only reached at about 60% of the<br>
relative tooth height.<br>
As regards the configuration of a short tooth formation of this kind as a whole,<br>
one could, in a graphic transposition of the rules according to the invention,<br>
compare the roof shape, in the case of a symmetrical tooth, with a human<br>
nose which, at the base of the nose, corresponding comparatively to the foot<br>
cylinder of the tooth formation, is designed particularly narrow, subsequently<br>
becoming broader up to the tip of the nose. The bridge of the nose may in<br>
this context slope either rectilinearly or by being bent downwardly, the lowest<br>
point of the nose, by way of comparison, corresponding to the head cylinder<br>
of the tooth formation. In order to remain with the demonstrated image, the<br>
longitudinal body axis of the nose carrier would correspond to the rotational<br>
axis of the tooth formation.<br><br>
As regards the oblique roof surfaces laterally adjoining the roof edge, these<br>
are preferably designed as level planes. This facilitates their shaping in a<br>
deformation process, e.g. for the manufacture as a forged part, in which<br>
context one or more calibrating steps may follow onto a forging step.<br>
Arched roof surfaces are, however, likewise conceivable within the scope of<br>
the invention, but their precise manufacture encounters difficulties with<br>
regard to minimum deformations as in the case of coupling teeth. This applies<br>
similarly to asymmetrical roof shapes, the manufacture of which presupposes<br>
likewise a high precision of the forming tools or of the deformation process.<br>
The invention is elucidated in the following by way of a number of<br>
embodiments. There are shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein<br>
Figs. 1 to 4 a tooth of a tooth formation with a proportional radius increase,<br>
in four different views,<br>
Fig. 5	a graphic illustration of the proportional radius increase,<br>
Fig. 6	patterns of the radius increase in a graphic illustration,<br>
Fig. 7	a graphic illustration of the progressive radius increase,<br>
Figs. 8 to 11 a tooth having a symmetrical roof shape and a progressive<br>
radius increase, in four different views,<br>
Figs. 12 to 15 a tooth having an asymmetrical roof shape and a progressive<br>
radius increase, in four different views,<br>
Fig. 16	a tooth having a symmetrical roof shape in a perspective view<br>
and<br>
Fig. 17	a tooth having an asymmetrical roof shape in a perspective view<br>
The tooth illustrated in Figs. 1 to 4 of a tooth formation, e.g. in a sliding<br>
sleeve, is designed, as is apparent from the plan view (Fig. 3), somewhat<br>
trapezoidal in cross-section, i.e. from the tooth base 1 to the tooth head 2 it<br>
comprises obliquely converging side flanges 3. The roof outline of its<br><br>
symmetrical roof shape 4 is characterised by a roof edge 5 sloping from the<br>
tooth base 1 to the tooth head 2, being rounded as illustrated in the side<br>
elevation according to Fig. 2 as well as in the perspective view according to<br>
Fig. 4. Level roof surfaces 6 follow onto the rounded roof edge 5 on both<br>
sides. In accordance with the diverging course towards the tooth head 2 of<br>
the lateral cutting lines 7 of the rounded roof edge with the adjoining roof<br>
surfaces 6, it is readily apparent that the radius of the rounded roof edge<br>
increases from the tooth base 1 towards the tooth head 2. This, in the case of<br>
level roof surfaces 6, results in a deviation of the roof edge 5 from the<br>
theoretical cutting edge 8 of the two roof surfaces 6 illustrated in Fig. 1. Arrow<br>
P1 denotes the sliding direction of the tooth during coupling with the counter<br>
tooth formation.<br>
In the plan view according to Fig. 3 the tooth base is illustrated in a slightly<br>
curved manner. This pattern is to illustrate the base of the coupling teeth<br>
which continues with a dash-dotted extension line 9, the said base being a<br>
cylindrical surface having a longitudinal axis parallel to the sliding direction<br>
according to arrow P1.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graphic elucidation of the roof edge rounding of a tooth of a<br>
coupling tooth formation according to Figs. 1 to 4. The roof edge 5 in a<br>
sloping manner follows onto the base, indicated by a first structural line 10.<br>
Between a radius R1 in the region of the tooth base and a radius R2 in the<br>
region of the tooth head four additional Yadii Rj, are indicated which in their<br>
relationship to one another suggest a linear increase of the roof edge radius<br>
from the tooth base towards the tooth head.<br>
According to Fig. 6 the radius increase (y-axis) is graphically illustrated by<br>
way of example in the roof edge region in relation to the relative tooth height<br>
(x-axis), the tooth height being measured in the direction of a second<br>
structural line 11 (Fig. 5), increasing from the tooth base towards the tooth<br>
head. Two modifications are indicated in Fig. 6, namely one straight line I<br><br>
suggesting a linear course of the radius increase, as realised, for example, in<br>
a roof shape according to Figs. 1 to 4; furthermore a curve II of a progressive<br>
course of the radius increase as realised, for example, in a symmetrical roof<br>
shape according to Figs. 8 to 11 or in an asymmetrical roof shape according<br>
to Figs. 12 to 15. For both roof shapes reference numerals corresponding to<br>
Figs. 1 to 4 were used so that the renewed elucidation in detail of the<br>
individual components of these tooth designs may be dispensed with.<br>
In the case of the tooth design having a progressive radius increase<br>
according to Figs. 8 to 11, the roof edge 5 extends opposite the theoretical<br>
cutting edge 8 of the level roof surfaces 6 following a progressively sloping<br>
curve which corresponds to the outline of the roof edge 5 according to Fig. 7.<br>
In an asymmetrical tooth design according to Figs. 12 to 15 the roof is pulled<br>
to one side in such an extreme manner that on the steep side of the roof the<br>
roof surface coincides with the side flange 3, as is apparent particularly<br>
clearly from Fig. 13.<br>
In the drawing all edge lines between the roof surfaces 6, the side flanges 3<br>
and the head surface 2 are drawn by double lines. This serves to indicate the<br>
formation of small radii.<br>
Figs. 16 and 17 each illustrate in a diagram, supplemented by a line pattern,<br>
a section of a tooth having a symmetrical tooth shape (Fig. 16) as well as of a<br>
tooth having an asymmetrical tooth shape (Fig. 17). The teeth are fitted to a<br>
cylindrical basic body having a base 12 and, with the highest point of their<br>
roof surface each follow on to a cover surface 13 of the basic body in a flush<br>
manner. The rounded radii are clearly apparent both in the region of the roof<br>
edge 5 and also between the roof surfaces 6 and the side flanges 3.<br><br>
Coupling teeth exist where the base of the teeth opposite the roof surface is<br>
also forming part of the basic body by providing an appropriate shoulder 14<br>
there, indicated in Fig. 17 by dashed lines.<br><br><br>
