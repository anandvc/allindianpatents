(15), p 247). Intermediates of formula (D) wherein X is S can be prepared analogous to the procedure described in Capps et ai (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1953, p. 697) or US-3,752,820.<br>
A particular synthesis route for the preparation of intermediates of formula (II) wherein<br>
p is 1 and q is 2, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-1), is depicted in<br>
scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Step a can be performed analogous to the procedure described in Tetrahedron (1981), 37, p 979-982. Benzofurans resulting from step c have been used as intermediates in US 4,210,655. The further reaction steps are analogous to the reaction procedures described in US 3,752,820.<br>
Alternatively, intermediates of formula (II-1) can be prepared using the reaction steps<br>
depicted in scheme 2<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
Step a can be performed analogous to the procedure described in Heterocycles (1994), 39(1), p. 371 -380. Step b can be performed analogous to the procedure described in J. Med. Chem. (1986), 29(9), p. 1643-1650. Further reaction steps can be performed analogous to the ones described in J. Heterocycl. Chem. (1979), 16, p. 1321.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) wherein p is 2 and q is 1, said intermediates being<br>
represented by formula (TI-2), can be prepared according to Synth. Comm., 1995,<br>
p3883-3900 and using methods known in the art. A general procedure is depicted in<br>
scheme 3.<br>
Scheme 3.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (TI-2) wherein X is -O-, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-2-a), can be prepared as described in Syn. Comm. (1995), p3883-3900 and J. Chem. Soc., 1965, p4939-4953 and using methods known in the art. A general procedure is depicted in scheme 4.<br>

Scheme 5.<br><br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present in¬vention contain at least one asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically. The pure and mixed stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I), the N-oxides, the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, block the presynaptic a2-receptors<br>
on central noradrenergic neurons thus increasing the noradrenaline release. Blocking said receptors will suppress or relieve a variety of symptoms associated with a deficiency of noradrenaline in the central or peripheral nervous system. Therapeutic indications for using the present compounds are depression, cognitive disturbances, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellittis, sexual dysfunction and impotence and elevated intraocular pressure.<br>
In particular, the present compounds show a larger dissociation between binding affinity for a2-receptors and that for dopamine receptors, especially between a2A"receptors and dopamine D2 receptors. This larger dissociation reduces the risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) that might arise from dopamine receptor blockade and that should be avoided in the treatment of depression.<br>
Blocking 0:2 receptors in the central nervous system has also been shown to enhance the release of serotonine which may add to the therapeutic action in depression (Maura et aL, 1992, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. PharmacoL, 345 : 410-416).<br>
It has also been shown that blocking a2 receptors may induce an increase of extracellular DOPAC (3,4-dihydro-phenylacetic acid) which is a metabolite of dopamine and noradrenaline.<br>
In view of the usefulness of the subject compounds in the treatment of diseases as¬sociated with a deficiency of noradrenaline in the central nervous system, in particular depression and Parkinson's disease, the present invention provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from such diseases, in particular depression and Parkinson's disease, said method comprising the systemic administration of an therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof.<br>
The present compounds are also potentially useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia as it is known that 012-antagonists promote the release of<br>
acetylcholine (Tellez et al. 1997, J. Neurochem. 68:778-785).<br>
' In general it is contemplated that an effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 4 mg/kg body weight.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined<br><br>
hereinabove for use as a medicine. Further, the present invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating depression or Parkinson's disease.<br>
Ex vivo as well as in vitro receptor signal-transducrion and receptor binding studies can be used to evaluate the 03 adrenoceptor antagonism of the present compounds. As<br>
indices of central a2-adrenoceptor blockade in vivo, the reversal of the loss of righting<br>
reflex observed in rats after intravenous injection of xylazine and inhibition of the tremors induced by reserpine in rats can be used.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also have the ability to rapidly penetrate into the central nervous system.<br>
For administration purposes, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable earner and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in addition salt or in free acid or base form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the composmons in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets.  Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large pan, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and oilier oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which<br><br>
case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Addition salts of (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding free base or free acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical composi¬tions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein- refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention.<br>
Experimental part A. Preparation of the intermediates Fxamplp. A1<br>
A mixture of O-phenylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (1:1) (0.625 mol) and 4,4-piperidinediol hydrochloride (1:1) (0.682 mol) in 2-propanol (615 ml) was stirred at 20°C. HC1 (353 ml) was added dropwise at 20°C. The reaction mixture was gently heated to reflux temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed for 3 hours, then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with diisopropyl ether, and dried. This fraction was crystallized from water (1600 ml). The desired compound was allowed to crystallize out while stirring. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with 2-propanol and diisopropyl ether, then dried, yielding 84 g (64%) of l,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo-furo[3,2-c]pyridine hydrochloride (1:1) (internx 1).<br>
Example A2<br>
a) Reaction under N, atmosphere. NaH 60% (0.17 mol) was stirred in tetrahydrofuran<br>
(350 ml). A solution of diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (0.17 mol) in<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran (150 ml) was added dropwise over ± 20 minutes, (exothermic temperature rise to 30°C). The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at room temperature, then cooled to 0°C. A solution of 5-methyl-3(2/7)-benzofuranone (0.15 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (350 ml) was added dropwise over 30 minutes at 0°C. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, men poured out into water (1500 ml) and stirred. This mixture was extracted with ether, diisopropyl ether (2 x), dried, filtered and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography over silica gel (eluent: CH2Cl2/hexane 50/50).

C. Pharmacological examples<br>
Example C. 1 : In vitro binding affinity for 0:2 receptors<br>
The interaction of the compounds of formula (I) with 0:2 receptors was assessed in in<br>
vitro radioligand binding experiments.<br>
In general, a low concentration of a radioligand with a high binding affinity for a particular receptor is incubated with a sample of a tissue preparation enriched in a particular receptor or with a preparation of cells expressing cloned human receptors in a buffered medium. During the incubation, the radioligand binds to the receptor. When equilibrium of binding is reached, the receptor bound radioactivity is separated from the non-bound radioactivity, and the receptor bound activity is counted. The<br><br>
interaction of the test compounds with the receptor is assessed in competition binding experiments. Various concentrations of the test compound are added to the incubation mixture containing the receptor preparation and the radioligand. Binding of the radioligand will be inhibited by the test compound in proportion to its binding affinity and its concentration. The radioligand used for ct2A., a2B and a2C receptor binding is 3H-rauwolscine and<br>
the receptor preparation used is the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expressing cloned human a2A 2B and a2C receptors.<br>
The IC5o value (concentration whereby 50 % of the receptors is inhibited) for the compounds exemplified in the experimental part above for each of the three receptors ranged between 10"6 M and 10"10 M.<br>
Example C.2 : Dissociation in receptor binding affinity for a2A and dopamine D; As already mentioned above, dopamine D2 antagonism may lead 10 an increased risk of EPS   Thus, the larger the dissociation between a2A, and D2, the better. The columns headed "dissociation" show the IC50 value in molar (M) for the oc2, receptor and the D2 receptor.  By "Ratio" is meant the ratio D2/a2» and this is an indication for the dissociation between said two receptors.<br><br>
D. Composition examples<br>
"Active ingredient" (A.I.) as used throughout these examples relates to a compound of formula (I), a pharmaccutically acceptable addition salt or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof.<br>
Example D. 1 : Capsules<br>
20 g of the A_l., 6 g sodium lauryl sulfate, 56 g starch, 56 g lactose, 0.8 g colloidal silicon dioxide, and 1.2 g magnesium stearate are vigorously stirred together. The resulting mixture is subsequently filled into 1000 suitable hardened gelatin capsules, each comprising 20 mg of the AX.<br><br>
Example D.2 : Film-coated tablets Preparation of table core<br>
A mixture of 100 g of the A.I., 570 g lactose and 200 g starch is mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 g sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 g polyvinyl¬pyrrolidone in about 200 ml of water. The wet powder mixture is sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there are added 100 g microcrystalline cellulose and 15 g hydrogenated vegetable oil. The whole is mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each comprising 10 mg of the active ingredient<br>
Coatiog<br>
