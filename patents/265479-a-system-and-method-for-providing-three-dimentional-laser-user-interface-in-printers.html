■	*<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the<br><br>
invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention uses laser technology for providing user interface (Ul) in printers. These printers are interfaced to laser devices, which are capable of generating 3D laser images on air. These images convey the printer status. For different states of the printer like printing, Ready etc., different 3D laser images will be created.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and method for providing laser Ul in printers consisting of the printer engine, a laser unit controller and a laser display unit.<br>
The printer engine monitors the status of the machine and conveys the information to the laser unit controller. The laser unit controller controls a laser display unit for displaying the laser images in air. This laser display unit consists of a sliding lens and two moving mirrors for focusing the laser image at a particular plane in air. The present invention can be explained with reference to block diagram in figure 1.<br>
Printer engine is a component in printers and Multi functional peripherals (MFP) that actually performs the printing process in all printers and Multifunctional peripherals (MFP's). This component is responsible for actual printing and passing printer status to Ul component (User interface component). Ul component displays the status of printer only after getting the data (printer status) from engine component. Printer engine in different printers and MFP's are specified by their speed and resolution. The printer engine determines how fast and at what resolution the printer can print. The printer engine receives the commands from the printer driver and carries out the printing process.<br><br>
A laser unit controller is a part of Ul component of this proposed idea. This component gets printer status from engine component and sends commands to laser display device so that desired 3D image is generated. Laser unit controller controls the laser display unit. Laser Unit controller transfers the data by appropriate circuitry to the laser display unit to display 3D images. The Laser unit controller transfers the Machine status data that is received from the printer engine to the laser display unit which will display the status of the printer in the form of different shapes of 3D laser images. Laser unit controller consists of a controller, power supply, and necessary drivers to control the laser display unit<br>
The laser display unit consists essentially of a sliding lens and two moving mirrors for focusing the laser image at a particular plane in air.<br>
In figure 1, the printer engine monitors machine status and conveys machine status information to Laser unit controller. Laser unit controller controls the laser display unit. The laser unit controller sends commands to the laser display unit depending upon the status of the machine. The laser display unit in turn generates different 3D laser images as per the command given by the laser unit controller.<br>
•	*<br>
For displaying laser 3D laser images in air, pulsed infrared laser imaging technology is used. In this bright glowing plasma balls will be created at particular focal length. These plasma balls are created about 100 per second, each plasma ball lasting for about few nano seconds. These plasma balls are created in air at a distance proportional to the focal length. The focal point is directed by two moving mirrors and a sliding lens, allowing it to draw shapes in the air. The size, shape etc of the laser image can be programmed either in the Laser display unit or in the laser unit controller.<br><br>
As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the laser images can be used for feeding input value (keypad) for the machine. When the finger blocks or disturbs the laser/ray, then that particular X, Y and Z co-ordinate can be detected. This can be used to feed any command to the machine instead of using keypad.<br>
As another preferred embodiment of the present invention, Audio User Interface Facility (AUI) facility may also be provided along with the laser display feature. Each pulse is capable of generating popping sound. This capability of the laser beams to generate sounds can be used to provide this AUI (Audio User Interface) facility.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip; microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
