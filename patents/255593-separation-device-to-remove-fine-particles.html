				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention pertains to cyclone separators, equipped with a plurality of<br>
closed-bottom cyclones each having solids discharge means and gas reflux<br>
means, used to recover catalyst fines in the fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy<br>
hydrocarbon feeds. More particularly, the invention relates to the discovery<br>
and inhibition of cross talk between the solids discharge means and the gas<br>
reflux means.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cyclone separation is used to separate particles from gas. A particulate-<br>
laden gas stream is introduced into a cylindrical chamber. A spin is imposed<br>
on the gas, either by tangential addition or axial addition coupled with swirl<br>
vanes. Solids are thrown to the wall of the chamber by inertia, while a cleaner<br>
gas is withdrawn from a central region of the cyclone. Some gas exits with the<br>
solids. Solids may be discharged via a tangential outlet through a sidewall of<br>
the cyclone, or axially discharged.<br>
There are many types of cyclone separators, but they can be arbitrarily<br>
classified as open-bottom or closed-bottom. The present invention is especially<br>
useful for improving the operation of closed-bottom cyclones. Closed-bottom<br>
cyclones have a generally cylindrical body which is essentially closed save for<br>
one or more feed inlets, having usually only one gas outlet and a solids outlet.<br>
Closed-bottom cyclones are effectively isolated from the atmosphere of a<br>
vessel containing the cyclone. Closed-bottom cyclones usually run at a slightly<br>
higher or slightly lower pressure than the atmosphere in the vessel around the<br>
cyclone. If pressure in the cyclone body is higher than the pressure outside the<br>
cyclone, then the cyclone is a positive pressure cyclone. If pressure in the<br>
cyclone body is lower than the pressure outside the cyclone then the cyclone is<br>
a negative pressure cyclone.<br>
In a closed-bottom cyclone the feed gas is generally added tangentially<br>
to an end portion of the cyclone body. The gas outlet is usually a tube, axially<br>
aligned with the longitudinal axis of the cyclone body, passing through the<br>
same end of the cyclone receiving feed gas. The solids are usually withdrawn<br>
via an elongated dipleg at an end of the cyclone body opposing the gas outlet.<br>
In a third stage separator (TSS), discussed below, the solids are sometimes<br><br><br>
withdrawn via a horizontal slit or slot in the wall of the cyclone body, and<br>
usually at an end opposite from the gas outlet.<br>
Somewhat related to the distinction between open- and closed-bottom<br>
cyclones is whether or not the cyclone dust outlet shares the same space (or<br>
vessel volume) as the gas inlet or is isolated. When cyclones receive feed gas<br>
from, and discharge into, a fluid bed like the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)<br>
regenerator, gas discharged with solids through the diplegs recirculates up<br>
from the fluid bed to the cyclone inlet that is in the same space. Gas recycle<br>
from solids outlet to gas feed inlet occurs because the solids outlet and gas<br>
feed inlet share the same vapor volume in the reactor. When the feed gas inlet<br>
is fluidly isolated from the solids outlet, this type of gas recycle does not take<br>
place. When solids discharge into a closed vessel such as the bottom of a TSS,<br>
gas discharged with solids through the dust outlet of the cyclone cannot return<br>
to the cyclone inlet. It was always assumed that because the dust catcher was<br>
essentially sealed that no more gas would escape via the solids outlet than<br>
would be removed with the solids phase removed from the dust catcher, until<br>
the innovation to use a gas reflux in the outlet end of the cyclone as described<br>
in U.S. Patent 5,681,450 to Chitnis et al., which is hereby incorporated in its<br>
entirety for all purposes by reference herein.<br>
Briefly, the problem solved by the Chitnis et al. patent can be mentioned<br>
now as follows. In some types of cyclones, and in some cyclone placements,<br>
vapor recycle from the solids outlet to the feed gas inlet is not a significant<br>
problem. In open-bottom cyclones, pressures are essentially in balance inside<br>
and outside the cyclone. Some gas always leaves with or is entrained or<br>
aspirated with departing solids flow. Such gas, beyond that which is eventually<br>
removed with the separated solids, easily returns into the open body of the<br>
cyclone. In closed- or open-bottom cyclones where the dust outlet shares the<br>
same vapor space as the cyclone feed gas inlet, gas recycle is never a<br>
problem. The problem appears in generally closed cyclones where gas<br>
discharged with solids from the device has no easy way back into the cyclone,<br>
but the problem can appear to some extent even in open-bottom cyclones.<br>
In fluid catalytic cracking, catalyst having a particle size and color<br>
resembling beach sand circulates between a cracking reactor and a catalyst<br><br><br>
regenerator. In the reactor, hydrocarbon feed contacts a source of hot,<br>
regenerated catalyst. The hot catalyst vaporizes and cracks the feed at 425°C<br>
to 600°C, usually 460°C to 560°C. The cracking reaction deposits coke on the<br>
catalyst, thereby deactivating it. The cracked products are separated from the<br>
coked catalyst. The coked catalyst is stripped of volatiles, usually with steam, in<br>
a catalyst stripper and the stripped catalyst is then regenerated. The catalyst<br>
regenerator burns coke from the catalyst with oxygen-containing gas, usually<br>
air. Decoking restores catalyst activity and simultaneously heats the catalyst to,<br>
e.g., 500°C to 900°C, usually 600°C to 750°C. This heated catalyst is recycled<br>
to the cracking reactor to crack more fresh feed. Flue gas formed by burning<br>
coke in the regenerator may be treated for removal of particulates and for<br>
conversion of carbon monoxide, after which the flue gas is normally discharged<br>
into the atmosphere.<br>
One failure mode in FCC is erosion of the cyclone caused by years of<br>
operation with high velocity, catalyst fines-laden gas passing through the<br>
cyclones. Refiners do not like to use high internal cyclone velocities, but are<br>
driven to them because of the need to improve cyclone efficiency. The FCC<br>
unit must operate without exceeding local emission limits on particulates. The<br>
catalyst is somewhat expensive, and most units have over a hundred tons of<br>
catalyst in inventory. FCC units circulate tons of catalyst per minute. Large<br>
circulation rates are needed because feed rates are large, and for every ton of<br>
oil cracked, roughly 5 tons of catalyst are needed.<br>
These large amounts of catalyst must be removed from cracked<br>
products lest the heavy hydrocarbon products be contaminated with catalyst<br>
fines. Even with several stages of cyclone separation some catalyst fines<br>
invariably remain with the cracked products. These concentrate in the heaviest<br>
product fractions, usually in the main FCC fractionator bottoms, sometimes<br>
called the slurry oil because so much catalyst is present. Refiners may let this<br>
material sit in a tank to allow some entrained catalyst to drop out, producing<br>
CSO or clarified slurry oil.<br>
The problems are as severe or even worse in the regenerator. In<br>
addition to the large amounts of catalyst circulation needed to satisfy the<br>
demands of the cracking reactor, there is an additional internal catalyst<br><br><br>
circulation that must be dealt with. In most bubbling bed catalyst regenerators,<br>
an amount of catalyst equal to the entire catalyst inventory will pass through the<br>
regenerator cyclones every 15-30 minutes. Most units have several hundred<br>
tons of catalyst inventory. Any catalyst not recovered using the regenerator<br>
cyclones, typically comprising two stages of cyclones, will remain with the<br>
regenerator flue gas, unless a third stage separator, electrostatic precipitator or<br>
some sort of removal stage is added at considerable cost.<br>
Many refiners use a power recovery system. The energy in FCC<br>
regenerator flue gas drives the air blower supplying air to the regenerator. The<br>
amount and particle size of fines in most FCC flue gas streams exiting the<br>
regenerator is enough to erode turbine blades if a power recovery system is<br>
installed. Generally a third stage separator unit is installed upstream of the<br>
turbine to reduce the catalyst loading and protect the turbine blades, especially<br>
from particles greater than 10 urn in size. Some refiners even now install<br>
electrostatic precipitators or some other particulate removal stage downstream<br>
of third stage separators and turbines to further reduce fines emissions.<br>
Many refiners now use high efficiency third stage cyclones to decrease<br>
loss of FCC catalyst fines and/or protect power recovery turbine blades. It<br>
should be mentioned that whenever a third stage separator is used to clean up<br>
regenerator flue gas a fourth stage separator is typically used to process the<br>
underflow (solids rich portion) discharged from the third stage separator. Gas<br>
volumes in the fourth stage separator are small because third stage cyclone<br>
designs minimize the amount of gas discharged with the solids. Typically 0.5 to<br>
3% of the flue gas is removed with the solids discharged from the third stage<br>
separator. Third stage separators limit gas discharged with solids (gas in the<br>
underflow) to that needed to fluidize and discharge solids from the third stage<br>
separator.<br>
For these reasons, small size particles and relatively low gas volumes,<br>
the fourth stage separator generally comprises small diameter cyclones, a hot<br>
sintered metal or ceramic filter, or a bag house.<br>
Most refiners are satisfied with their primary and secondary cyclones or<br>
equivalent means for recovering catalyst from flue gas and discharging<br>
recovered catalyst back into the regenerator. The troublesome separation is<br><br><br>
downstream of the regenerator in the third stage separator or TSS unit. The<br>
TSS must produce gas with essentially no particles greater than 10 microns<br>
(when power recovery turbines are used) and/or achieve sufficient removal of<br>
fines to meet emissions particulates regulatory limits.<br>
Modern, high efficiency third stage separators typically have 50 to 100 or<br>
more small diameter cyclones. One type of third stage separator is described in<br>
"Improved Hot-Gas Expanders For Cat Cracker Flue Gas," Hydrocarbon<br>
Processing, March 1976. The device is fairly large, a 26-ft diameter vessel.<br>
Catalyst laden flue gas passes through many swirl tubes. Catalyst is thrown<br>
against the tube walls by centrifugal force. Clean gas is withdrawn up via a<br>
central gas outlet tube while solids are discharged through two blowdown slots<br>
in the base of an outer tube. The device removed most 10 micron and larger<br>
particles. The unit processed about 550,000 lbs/hour of flue gas containing 300<br>
lbs/hour of particles ranging from sub-micron fines to 60 micron sized catalyst<br>
particles. This corresponds to an inlet loading of about 680 mg/Nm3.<br>
The solids loading on various cyclones in various parts of the FCC<br>
process varies greatly. The third stage separator has the most difficult<br>
separation in terms of particle size, while the primary separators typically do<br>
99% of the solids recovery. This can be put into perspective by considering<br>
what happens in an exemplary FCC unit. In this exemplary unit the separation<br>
progresses as shown below in Table A, going from the primary and secondary<br>
cyclones making the initial separation of catalyst from flue gas in the<br>
regenerator through the TSS as final separation for the gas stream. The<br>
separated dust from the TSS is withdrawn to the fourth stage. Gas from the<br>
fourth stages merges with that of the third stage. Total emissions are 0.0474<br>
tons/hr, corresponding to a loading of 215 mg/Nm3.<br><br><br><br>
The total solids throughput per cyclone is expressed as tons per hour.<br>
The average particle size of the solids feed to each cyclone changes markedly.<br>
Larger particles are preferentially removed so each downstream stage, through<br>
the third stage, sees fewer solids with a much smaller particle size distribution.<br>
The first stage or primary cyclones do most of the work, generally<br>
recovering more than 99% of the total solids in a single stage. The first stage<br>
cyclones also have the easiest job, in that the particles are relatively large,<br>
around 60-80 microns, there are large amounts of gas available to generate<br>
centrifugal forces, and the discharge of significant amounts of flue gas down<br>
the cyclone dipleg has no adverse consequences. The solids loading is high.<br>
The first stage cyclone removes large amounts of solids using large amounts of<br>
gas to generate centrifugal forces. Some gas is discharged with the solids, as<br>
gas is needed to maintain fluidization of the recovered solids. This entrained<br><br><br>
gas simply recycles through the bed of catalyst in the regenerator and returns<br>
into the inlet horn of the first stage or primary cyclone.<br>
The secondary FCC regenerator cyclones treat as much gas as the<br>
primary cyclones, but orders of magnitude less solids. Secondary cyclones<br>
recover typically around 95-98% of the solids charged to them. The secondary<br>
cyclones can recover additional amounts of particulates from gas discharged<br>
from the primary cyclones. This is because lower solids loadings in the<br>
secondary cyclones permit higher gas velocities to be used in secondary<br>
cyclones than in primary cyclones. Higher gas velocities develop higher<br>
centrifugal forces to improve efficiency. The second stage cyclone has about<br>
the same gas flow as the first, but orders of magnitude less solids. Small<br>
amounts of solids are discharged from the second stage cyclone diplegs, with<br>
small amounts of gas. As is the case in the first stage, this gas simply reenters<br>
the FCC regenerator atmosphere. This gas becomes a small part of the gas<br>
feed to the first stage cyclone.<br>
Because primary and secondary cyclones are so efficient, essentially all<br>
of the easy-to-remove particles are removed after two stages of cyclone<br>
separation. Only fines, irregularly shaped fragments of FCC catalyst, remain in<br>
the gas to the third stage separator. Third stage separator cyclone operation is<br>
characterized by large volumes of gas and small amounts of extremely fine<br>
particulates, much of it smaller than 5 microns. Each downstream stage, from<br>
the first stage through the third stage, sees less solids and smaller particles.<br>
Much more gas per unit weight of solids is discharged via the solids outlet in<br>
third stage separators as compared to cyclones in the regenerator. On a weight<br>
basis, more than 10 grams of gas are discharged per 1 gram of fines<br>
discharged to the catch chamber of TSS cyclones. Contrast this with operation<br>
in first and second stage cyclones in the FCC regenerator, where 1 gram of gas<br>
transports over 1000 grams of FCC catalyst down a dipleg. It can be said that<br>
from 10,000 to 100,000 times as much gas is present in third stage separator<br>
solids discharge stream as compared to solids discharge via the dipleg of a<br>
primary cyclone. In part because of the relatively small amounts of solids<br>
involved, and large gas volumes, typically 5 orders of magnitude more gas<br>
relative to solids, many TSS cyclones are open-bottom.<br><br><br>
After the gas leaves the gas outlet of the third stage separator, it has a<br>
sharply reduced solids content as compared to say the gas from the first stage<br>
cyclone. Although there is not much solids loading at this point, the amount of<br>
solids may be sufficient to destroy or damage power recovery turbines, and<br>
may exceed local existing or projected limits on particulates emissions, which<br>
at several localities are as low as 50 mg/Nm3.<br>
These developments are somewhat surprising in view of the many<br>
improvements which have occurred both in cyclone efficiency and catalyst<br>
properties. Cyclone efficiency has improved during the 50 years FCC has been<br>
in use in refineries. FCC catalysts are stronger and more attrition resistant.<br>
These factors (better cyclones, stronger catalyst), if considered alone, would<br>
make FCC flue gas cleaner. Offsetting factors have included an increase in<br>
catalyst circulation rates, multiplying the load on the cyclones. Higher cyclone<br>
efficiencies are achieved by using higher velocities in the cyclones to generate<br>
stronger centrifugal forces. The high velocities can fracture or break even<br>
modern attrition-resistant catalysts to produce more fines which are harder to<br>
recover and also tend to wear out the cyclones. High efficiency <and high></and>
velocity) cyclones increase fines recovery, but the gas makes more turns in the<br>
cyclone body, increasing catalyst attrition.<br>
Particle recovery in conventional large diameter cyclones associated<br>
with the FCC regenerator had reached a plateau. Refiners resorted to third<br>
stage separators (TSS) with many small diameter cyclones to increase<br>
particulate removal from FCC flue gas. Mechanically, third stage separators<br>
are complex. Many TSS cyclones are needed to handle the large volumes<br>
encountered in FCC flue gas streams. Each cyclone is of small diameter and is<br>
mounted either vertically or horizontally. One cyclone manufacturer uses many<br>
small cyclones, 10 inches in diameter, to increase centrifugal forces and reduce<br>
radial distance to a wall where solids could collect. Since many cyclones are<br>
needed, it is generally necessary to install them in a single vessel, acting as a<br>
manifold. The TSS unit made it easier for particles to reach the wall of the<br>
cyclone by reducing the distance to the cyclone walls. The offsetting factor is<br>
some increase in pressure drop, and considerable capital expense for a unit<br>
which made only a modest improvement in fines removal.<br><br><br>
TSS units allowed refiners to reach a new level of solids recovery, but<br>
known TSS units were not always adequate for refiners wanting to use power<br>
recovery turbines. Refiners were at an impasse for improving TSS cyclone<br>
efficiency. Then, the innovations of Chitnis et al. (U.S. Patent 5,681,450)<br>
improved the operation of cyclones, especially their performance on the less<br>
than 5 micron particles, which are difficult to remove in conventional cyclones<br>
and difficult and costly to remove using electrostatic precipitation. These<br>
improvements reduced dust re-entrainment from TSS units. TSS cyclones had<br>
not satisfactorily addressed the problem of how to deal with gas discharged<br>
with the solids. Relatively large amounts of gas are discharged with solids<br>
whether solids are discharged tangentially via a slot cut in a sidewall of the<br>
cyclone barrel or axially via an open bottom solids outlet opposite the clean gas<br>
outlet. In some TSS cyclones there is no dipleg and no place for de-aeration of<br>
solids. The solids are discharged at a relatively high velocity and may aspirate<br>
a significant amount of gas. Rather than gas fluidizing the solids, the solids are<br>
carrying out excessive amounts of gas. At the solids outlet of TSS cyclones, the<br>
considerable kinetic energy in the solids carries gas from the cyclone body.<br>
Chitnis et al. wondered what happens to this gas, and observed significant and<br>
fluctuating flow of gas out of and into the longitudinal slot of test cyclones,<br>
which seemed chaotic. Gas from one cyclone flowed into the catch chamber<br>
and then reentered the same cyclone as well as other cyclones. Reducing<br>
length and width of the slot seemed to reduce the gas flow and the interaction<br>
between the cyclones.<br>
Chitnis et al. realized the discharged catalyst always carried gas with it<br>
into the catch chamber where it had no place to go. Only a minor amount of this<br>
gas was needed for the underflow. Much larger amounts of gas exited trie<br>
cyclone, and re-entered the cyclone in some way. Chitnis et al. observed<br>
localized pulses of catalyst/gas discharge alternating with reverse flow of gas<br>
back into the barrel slot. This was the only way for gas discharged with the<br>
solids-rich phase to return to the cyclones from the catch chamber, as there<br>
was not enough gas removed with the solids phase from the bottom of the<br>
device to mass balance the cyclones. Chitnis et al. concluded that all TSS<br>
cyclones unintentionally recycle or reflux gas back through the solids outlet into<br><br><br>
the cyclone body. Refluxing gas entrained solids back into the inner vortex of<br>
the cyclone and out the gas outlet tube. The problem stemmed from the way<br>
the gas returns into the cyclone body of the cyclone. Without some other<br>
means for gas reflux, a reverse flow, chaotic or randomly fluctuating in space<br>
and time, refluxed this gas via the solids outlet. This gas reflux flow was<br>
countercurrent to flow out of the solids discharge. A cyclone could alternate<br>
between a high solids discharge phase and a lower solids reflux phase.<br>
Another alternative was for one end of an outlet slot to discharge solids while<br>
the other end of the slot permitted reflux back into the cyclone. In either case<br>
the effect of chaotic reflux via the solids outlet was to disrupt gas streamlines of<br>
the tangential flow within the cyclone body.<br>
Chitnis et al. were able to stabilize the cyclone operation, and roughly<br>
halve the amount of fines discharged from the gas outlet tube, by providing a<br>
separate gas reflux means, preferably in the bottom of the cyclone body. Still,<br>
further improvements in the solids separation in the Chitnis et al. third stage<br>
separator cyclones were desired.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention concerns the discovery of secondary re-<br>
entrainment of catalyst particles in third stage separator cyclones, and the use<br>
of shields to enhance solid separation and reduce the solids entrainment in the<br>
gas discharge from a low-chaos gas/solid cyclone separator. Cold flow studies<br>
have shown that shields installed on the Chitnis et al. cyclones remarkably<br>
improved their performance. The shields prevent secondary re-entrainment of<br>
catalyst already separated from the settling chamber. This secondary<br>
entrainment phenomenon is termed "cross-talk." The shields, preferably in the<br>
form of tubes, function as baffles around the bottom end of the reflux tubes to<br>
substantially inhibit this cross-talk. Particularly where the cyclones are spaced<br>
relatively closely together and terminate at different heights, the shields<br>
substantially prevent solids discharged from the solids outlet of an adjacent<br>
cyclone from being re-entrained in the gas recycle into the gas reflux openings<br>
in the cyclones.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an external separator<br>
housing a plurality of cyclones in an external separator vessel. The separator<br><br>
is useful, for example, in a fluidized catalytic cracking process wherein a<br>
hydrocarbon feed is catalytically cracked by contact with a regenerated<br>
cracking catalyst in a cracking reactor to produce lighter products and spent<br>
catalyst, and spent catalyst is regenerated in a catalyst regenerator having one<br>
or more separators for recovery of catalyst and fines from flue gas to produce<br>
regenerated catalyst that is recycled to the cracking reactor, and regenerator<br>
flue gas containing catalyst fines. The external separator removes at least a<br>
portion of the fines from the regenerator flue gas stream. Each of the cyclones<br>
has a cyclone body, a flue gas inlet, a gas outlet tube, a gas reflux opening,<br>
and a shield. The cyclone body has a length, a longitudinal axis, an inlet end<br>
and an outlet end. The flue gas inlet is in fluid communication with the inlet end<br>
of the cyclone body. The gas outlet tube in the inlet end of the cyclone body<br>
has a longitudinal axis aligned with the longitudinal axis of the cyclone body for<br>
withdrawing gas with a reduced fines content. The solids outlet is disposed in<br>
the outlet end of the cyclone body for discharge of fines and a minor amount of<br>
gas into a catch chamber in a lower portion of the external separator vessel.<br>
The gas reflux opening is disposed in the outlet end of the cyclone body, fluidly<br>
isolated from the flue gas inlet at the inlet end of the cyclone body, for recycling<br>
a portion of the gas discharged with the solids through the solids outlet from the<br>
catch chamber back into the cyclone body. The shield extends downwardly<br>
from the outlet end of the cyclone body around the gas reflux opening to inhibit<br>
solids from being entrained in the gas recycled through the gas reflux opening<br>
into the cyclone body.<br>
The cyclone body is preferably cylindrical and the solids outlet can<br>
include an opening in a sidewall for tangential discharge of fines and a minor<br>
amount of gas into the catch chamber. The gas reflux opening can be a hole or<br>
a cylindrical tube having a longitudinal axis aligned with the longitudinal axis of<br>
the cyclone body and passing through a seal in the outlet end of the cyclone<br>
body. The gas reflux tube preferably discharges gas reflux tangentially into the<br>
cyclone body. The feed gas inlet preferably discharges gas tangentially or<br>
axially into the cyclone body.<br>
When the gas reflux opening is a tube, it can extend within the cyclone<br>
body from 0 to 1 cyclone body lengths and/or extend outside the cyclone body<br><br><br>
into the catch chamber from 0 to 1 cyclone body lengths. Swirl vanes can be<br>
fluidly associated with the gas reflux opening. Either or both of the gas reflux<br>
entry into the gas reflux tube and the gas reflux exit from the gas reflux tube<br>
can be tangential. Preferably, the tangential discharges of the gas reflux tube<br>
and the feed gas inlet both induce spin in the same direction within the cyclone<br>
body.<br>
The shield can be any suitable shape, but is preferably cylindrical with<br>
an open lower end, and preferably has a cross-sectional area larger than the<br>
gas reflux opening. A lower end of the shield preferably terminates below a<br>
lower end of any lower end of the gas reflux tube. An upper end of the shield is<br>
preferably contiguous with the outlet end of the cyclone. The shield preferably<br>
terminates at a lower end spaced above any dense phase of solids in the catch<br>
chamber.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a cyclone separator that has a<br>
closed-bottom cyclone body having a length and a longitudinal axis. A feed<br>
gas inlet is disposed at an inlet end of the cyclone body for a stream of gas and<br>
entrained solids. A gas outlet tube in the inlet end has a longitudinal axis<br>
aligned with the longitudinal axis of the cyclone body for withdrawing gas with a<br>
reduced entrained solids content. A solids outlet is disposed in a sidewall of<br>
the cyclone body for tangential discharge of solids and a minor amount of gas<br>
from the closed-bottom cyclone into a catch chamber. A gas reflux opening is<br>
fluidly isolated from the feed gas inlet for recycling gas from the catch chamber<br>
back into the cyclone body. A shield extends downwardly from the cyclone<br>
body around the gas reflux opening. The gas reflux opening can include a tube<br>
extending within the cyclone body from 0 to 1 cyclone body lengths and<br>
extending outside the cyclone body into the catch chamber from 0 to 1 cyclone<br>
body lengths. The shield preferably extends downwardly from the cyclone<br>
body to below any lower end of the gas reflux tube.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides a cyclone<br>
separator, which has a gas reflux tube passing through and sealingly affixed to<br>
a closed end of an at least partially cylindrical cyclone body having a length, a<br>
diameter and a longitudinal axis. The reflux tube has <a a diameter smaller></a>
than the diameter of the cyclone body, (b) a reflux inlet outside the cyclone<br><br><br>
body, and (c) a reflux exit inside the cyclone body. The cylindrical cyclone<br>
body has the sealed end as one end thereof, and a gas outlet tube, sealingly<br>
affixed and passing through an opposing end of the cyclone body. The gas<br>
outlet tube has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the cyclone body and a<br>
longitudinal axis axially aligned with the cyclone body. The reflux exit is in a<br>
portion of the gas reflux tube which is axially aligned with the gas outlet tube. A<br>
tangential gas and solids inlet fluidly connects with the opposing end of the<br>
cyclone body end receiving gas and entrained solids. A solids outlet is<br>
provided for discharging a concentrated solids stream with a minor portion of<br>
gas from the cyclone body via at least one opening in a sidewall of the cyclone<br>
body near the sealed end. The solids outlet and the gas reflux inlet are fluidly<br>
connected outside of the cyclone body. A shield is disposed between the<br>
solids outlet and the gas reflux inlet to inhibit entrainment of solids from the<br>
solids outlet into the gas reflux inlet. Preferably, the reflux tube extends on<br>
either side of the cyclone body by a distance equal to 0 to 100% of the length of<br>
the cyclone body, and the shield extends downwardly from the cyclone body to<br>
below any lower end of the gas reflux tube below the cyclone body.<br>
A still further aspect of the present invention is that it provides a multi-<br>
cyclone gas/solids separator that has a plurality of cyclones spaced horizontally<br>
apart from adjacent cyclones. Each cyclone has a cyclone body including a<br>
feed inlet end for admitting gas and entrained solids into an annular space<br>
defined by a sidewall of the cyclone body and a cylindrical gas outlet tube<br>
axially aligned with the cyclone body. A solids outlet at an opposing end of the<br>
cyclone body has a tangential outlet for solids and a minor amount of gas<br>
through a sidewall of the cyclone body. A gas reflux opening is axially aligned<br>
with the outlet tube. The plurality of cyclones share both a common catch<br>
chamber for solids discharged from the solids outlet, and a common manifold<br>
for supply of gas and entrained solids. A plurality of shields positioned in the<br>
catch chamber inhibit discharge of solids from the tangential outlet of the<br>
adjacent cyclones into a vicinity of an inlet of the gas reflux opening. The gas<br>
reflux opening preferably includes a tube having an interior portion within the<br>
cyclone body and an exterior portion extending into the catch chamber, wherein<br>
the interior portion includes imperforate sidewalls and open ends, and the<br><br><br>
exterior portion has a cylindrical tube sealed at the end extending downwardly<br>
into the catch chamber surrounded by a said shield having a diameter larger<br>
than the downwardly extending cylindrical tube. The shield preferably has a<br>
lower end terminating below a lowermost end of the downwardly extending<br>
cylindrical tube.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides in another aspect, an<br>
improvement in a multi-cyclone gas/solids separator comprising a plurality of<br>
cyclones spaced horizontally apart from adjacent cyclones, each comprising a<br>
cyclone body having (i) a feed inlet end for admitting gas and entrained solids<br>
into an annular space defined by a sidewall of the cyclone body and a<br>
cylindrical gas outlet tube axially aligned with the cyclone body; (ii) a solids<br>
outlet at an opposing end of the cyclone body having a tangential outlet for<br>
solids and a minor amount of gas through a sidewall of the cyclone body; and<br>
(iii) a gas reflux opening axially aligned with the outlet tube, wherein the<br>
plurality of cyclones share both a common catch chamber for solids discharged<br>
from the solids outlet, and a common manifold for gas and entrained solids.<br>
The improvement comprises a plurality of shields positioned in the catch<br>
chamber to inhibit discharge of solids from the tangential outlet of the adjacent<br>
cyclones into a vicinity of an inlet of the gas reflux opening. The shields are<br>
preferably cylindrical tubes extending downwardly from the solids outlet end of<br>
the cyclone body around the gas reflux openings. The shields can have a<br>
diameter greater than the gas reflux openings and an open lower end. The<br>
lower ends of the shields preferably terminate below a lower end of the gas<br>
reflux openings, and above a level of dense phase solids in the catch basin.<br>
The lower ends of the shields depending from the cyclone bodies preferably<br>
terminate at about the same height in the catch basin.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the provision of apparatus for<br>
separating a gas-solids mixture. The apparatus includes a closed bottom<br>
cyclone, a gas reflux opening in a lower end of the cyclone, and a shield<br>
depending from a lower end of the cyclone around the gas reflux opening. The<br>
shield is preferably contiguous with the cyclone to surround the gas reflux<br>
opening. The gas reflux opening preferably includes a tubular passage. The<br>
shield can be a concentric tube having an inside diameter larger than an<br><br><br>
outside wall of the tubular passage. The tube preferably terminates below a<br>
lowermost end of the tubular passage.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method for separating a gas-solid<br>
mixture. The method includes the steps of introducing the mixture to respective<br>
inlets of a plurality of adjacent closed-bottom cyclones, discharging solids-lean<br>
gas from upper ends of the respective cyclones, discharging solids containing<br>
entrained gas from tangential outlets at lower ends of the respective cyclones,<br>
refluxing a portion of the entrained gas into the cyclones through reflux<br>
openings formed in lower ends of the respective cyclones, and shielding the<br>
reflux openings from the tangential outlets to inhibit cross-talk.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus for separating a gas-<br>
solid mixture. The apparatus includes means for introducing the mixture to<br>
respective inlets of a plurality of adjacent closed-bottom cyclones, means for<br>
discharging solids-lean gas from upper ends of the respective cyclones, means<br>
for discharging solids containing entrained gas from tangential outlets at lower<br>
ends of the respective cyclones, means for refluxing a portion of the entrained<br>
gas into the cyclones through reflux openings formed in lower ends of the<br>
respective cyclones, and means for shielding the reflux openings from the<br>
tangential outlets to inhibit cross-talk.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 (prior art) is a third stage separator (TSS) similar to the reduced<br>
chaos cyclone separator of U.S. Patent 5,681,450 to Chitnis et al. TSS 100<br>
receives a fines-containing FCC flue gas via inlet 102. The feed gas is<br>
distributed in plenum 104 to the inlets of a plurality of cyclones 106. Each<br>
cyclone 106 is equipped with entry swirl vanes (not shown; see Fig. 3) to<br>
induce a tangential flow pattern in a barrel 108. Fines collect on the wall of<br>
each barrel 108 and are discharged from each solids exit slot 110 formed in a<br>
lower end thereof. Gas discharged with the solids into the catch basin 112 re-<br>
enters each barrel 108 via a gas reflux tube 114. Clean gas is withdrawn via<br>
each outlet tube 116 and removed from the vessel via gas outlet 118. Solids<br>
that accumulate in the catch basin 112 are removed via solids outlet 120.<br>
Each of the cyclones 106 has essentially the same dimensions, i.e. each<br>
barrel 108 has the same length and diameter. Since the height of the plenum<br>
104 typically tends downward as it extends outwardly from the center of the<br>
vessel, the elevation of the solids exit slots 110 will likewise tend lower. Thus,<br>
the cyclones 106 at an outer position will have a solids exit slot 110 below the<br>
bottom of the cyclones 106 at an inner position. This difference in the height of<br>
the cyclones 106, we believe, contributes to cross-talk between the solids exit<br>
slots 110 and the lower end of the re-entry tubes 114. Pointing the solids exit<br>
slot 110 away from the adjacent cyclone 106 does not eliminate the cross-talk<br>
because there are usually hundreds of relatively closely-spaced cyclones 106<br>
in the TSS 100. Also, cyclones 106 are relatively spaced in every horizontal<br>
direction, especially for the cyclones 106 intermediate the center and outer<br>
periphery of the TSS 100.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the TSS of Fig. 1, wherein correspondence in the last two<br>
digits of the reference numerals in Figs. 1 and 2 is used to indicate<br>
correspondingly similar parts. The cyclones 206 have been retrofitted with<br>
respective shield tubes 222 in accordance with the principles of the present<br><br><br>
invention. Although each barrel 208 of the cyclones 206 terminates at a<br>
different height in the catch chamber 212 relative to adjacent ones of the<br>
cyclones 206 that are closer to or farther away from center of the TSS 200, the<br>
shields 222 have an inversely corresponding length so that the lower ends of<br>
the shields 222 all terminate at about the same height, preferably above any<br>
dense phase of solids in the catch chamber 212.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a simplified sectional view of a preferred cyclone of the<br>
invention, and Fig. 4 shows a bottom view of the same cyclone. The inlet gas<br>
and entrained solids enter axially in the annulus between the barrel 208 and the<br>
gas outlet tube 216 where they are tangentially directed by the swirl vanes 224.<br>
Gas flow spirals around the outlet tube 216. Centrifugal force throws the<br>
particulates to the wall of the barrel 208. Solids collect as a relatively thin,<br>
circulating layer of particles which are discharged through one or more<br>
tangential dust outlets 210. The cyclone 206 has a closed bottom 226 which is<br>
preferably a blind flange 228 bolted to a mating flange 230 at the lower end of<br>
the barrel 208. Gas re-entry is provided by a centrally disposed tube 214<br>
passing through and/or secured to the blind flange 228. Although not required,<br>
the shield tube 222 conveniently has the same diameter as the barrel 208, and<br>
is welded or otherwise secured to the blind flange 228. In retrofitting a Chitnis<br>
et al. cyclone, the shield 222 is added to each cyclone by, for example, welding<br>
the shield tube 222 to the lower surface of the blind flange 228 supporting the<br>
re-entry tube 214.<br>
Although the shielded re-entry cyclone 206 is described in one example<br>
in reference to the specific features of the cyclone 206 in Figs. 2-4, it is readily<br>
appreciated that the shielded cyclone can take any form of the closed-bottom,<br>
gas-reflux equipped cyclones described in Chitnis et al. modified to include the<br>
shield 222 of the present invention.<br>
The invention is further understood by reference to the following<br>
examples.<br>
Example - Cold Flow Modeling<br>
The performance of axial entry cyclones with and without shields was<br>
studied in a large-scale cold flow unit. The cold flow unit was scaled down from<br>
a commercial design, and represented an existing third stage separator (TSS)<br><br><br>
design of Chitnis et al. in which catalyst particles had accumulated inside the<br>
gas reflux tubes of some of the TSS cyclones. The cold flow model had four<br>
operating and two non-operating cyclone elements, the size, inlet gas velocity<br>
and dust loading of which were typical at the outlet of a commercial FCC<br>
regenerator as indicated by a comparison of the design bases set out in Table<br>
1:<br><br>
The schematic diagram of the test rig is shown in Fig. 5. The catalyst<br>
was fed, through air eduction, into the inlet pipe 310. The test facility was<br>
operated under vacuum by connecting the outlet gas filter exhaust 314 to the<br>
inlet of an air blower 316. The inlet pipe 310 was connected to the inlet plenum<br>
320 through baffled windows 322. The baffle ensured good distribution of the<br>
incoming dust-laden air into the inlet plenum 320. The inlet plenum 320 was<br>
curved in a manner typical of a commercial TSS design. The catalyst-laden air<br>
entered the axial flow cyclones 322 through their swirl vanes 324. Fig. 6 shows<br>
the plan of the layout of the inlet pipe 310 and cyclones 322 (identified as<br>
cyclones 322A through 322F in Fig. 6) over the settling chamber 328. Cyclones<br>
322A through 322F were arranged on a triangular pitch as in a typical TSS.<br>
The cyclone body 326 terminated into the settling chamber (holding vessel) 328<br><br><br>
below the inlet plenum 320, which had a diameter to match the upflow in a<br>
typical commercial TSS. The concentrated dust and entrained gas exited the<br>
cyclones 322 through the solids exit slot 323 into the settling chamber 328.<br>
Part of the gas with the concentrated dust was vented through the underflow<br>
pot 330, and then filtered at 332 before it was combined with the clean gas<br>
from the gas outlet filters 334 prior to entering the suction of the air blower 316.<br>
The gas flow rate through the underflow line 336 was measured and controlled<br>
by a butterfly valve (not shown). The dust in the underflow gas was removed in<br>
the underflow filter 332.<br>
The excess gas stream that entered the settling chamber 328 through<br>
the solids exit slot flowed back into the cyclones 322 through the re-entry tube<br>
340 located at the bottom of the cyclone 322. The section of the cyclone 322<br>
containing the dust exit slot 323 and the re-entry tube 340 was designed as a<br>
separate spool piece to allow quick re-orientation of the dust slot discharge.<br>
The clean gas exited the cyclone through pipe 342 into the outlet plenum 344<br>
from where it flowed through the outlet filters 334 to remove any entrained<br>
catalyst particles. The clean gas, combined with the clean underflow gas, then<br>
flowed via line 314 into the suction of the blower 316. The gas flow was<br>
measured but not controlled. The overall gas flow rate through the unit (and<br>
unit pressure) was manually controlled with the damper 346 at the exit of the<br>
blower 316. The unit was instrumented throughout with hot wire anemometers,<br>
pitot tubes, manometers and pressure gauges for flow and pressure<br>
measurements, including provisions for helium gas tracer work and mapping of<br>
gas velocities in the cyclone 322 and plenum chamber.<br>
Each cyclone 322 had an inside diameter of 10 inches and a length of 5<br>
feet. The dust outlet slot measured 2.5 inches high by either 1 or 1.5 inches<br>
wide. The re-entry tube 340 was nominal 1 inch, 2 inch or 3 inch pipe. The<br>
gas velocity through the swirl vanes 324 was about 240-250 ft/s, and the dust<br>
loading was 0.332 grains per actual cubic foot. At a gas underflow rate of 3<br>
percent, the gas velocity in the 1 -inch re-entry tube 340 was about 40-50 ft/s.<br>
A catalyst feed mixture was prepared by mixing together 22.5% by<br>
weight of fresh FCC equilibrium catalyst, 44% by weight of the fourth stage<br>
catch from a refinery and 33.5% by weight of the electrostatic precipitator catch<br><br><br>
from the refinery. The proportions were selected to match as closely as<br>
possible the typical commercial TSS inlet particle size distribution and<br>
thoroughly mixed before use. Approximately 0.002 lb/lb of LAROSTAT 519<br>
was added to the feed blend to minimize static electricity effects. A Coulter<br>
counter was used for particle size measurements and selected measurements<br>
were verified with scanning electron microscopy.<br>
The shields 335 had the same inside and outside diameters as the main<br>
body of the cyclones 322, and each of the shields 322 terminated at the same<br>
height as the other shields 335, well below the lower end of the re-entry tubes<br>
340 but above the upper level of the dense bed in the settling chamber 328.<br>
The cyclones of the TSS did not terminate at the same elevation in the settling<br>
chamber 328 because of the curvature of the inlet plenum 320. Consequently,<br>
some of the dust slots discharged towards the entrance of some re-entry tubes<br>
340. The gas entering the cyclones 322 from the settling chamber 328 also re-<br>
entrained catalyst because of the net upwards velocity inside the chamber 328.<br>
Test results showed that the shields 335 were beneficial to the operation of the<br>
TSS. They increased the overall collection efficiency of the cyclones 322 by<br>
almost 6 percent, and eliminated all the particles greater than 10 pm in the<br>
clean gas stream exiting the cyclones 322 without shields 335. As shown in<br>
Fig. 7, a comparison of the particle distribution for the TSS elements with and<br>
without shields 335 showed that there were no particles larger than 10 jim in<br>
the clean gas after the shields 335 were installed. The cut size (the maximum<br>
particle size in the clean gas outlet of the TSS) was essentially unchanged by<br>
the installation of shields 335. In other words, the shields 335 did not adversely<br>
affect the primary operation of the cyclones 322; they only eliminated or<br>
reduced secondary particle re-entrainment from the settling chamber 328. The<br>
results from the cold flow modeling demonstrated that the overall performance<br>
of the TSS was enhanced by eliminating secondary re-entrainment from the<br>
settling chamber by the installation of shields. The secondary re-entrainment is<br>
the result of catalyst particles that exit from one cyclone in close proximity to<br>
the gas reflux tubes of adjacent cyclones and are aspirated into an adjacent<br>
cyclone through its reflux tube.<br><br><br>
The dust settling chamber 328 showed strong clock-wise (top view)<br>
circulation of air as indicated by broad bands of dusts moving in a descending<br>
pattern along the wall. The dust bands were lifted near the dust outlet cyclones<br>
322E, 322F and flowed downwards in the vicinity of cyclone 322A, suggesting<br>
that the proximity of the outlet of the various cyclones 322 to the chamber 328<br>
wall and the orientation of the cyclone dust outlet slots primarily determine the<br>
rotation speed and direction. The pairing of left spinning with right spinning<br>
cyclones was not sufficient to eliminate rotation in the chamber 328. This<br>
rotational motion in the settling chamber 328 did not change when cyclone<br>
322E was isolated from the gas flow path. The rotation in the settling chamber<br>
328 was still fairly strong after turning the underflow off, suggesting that a<br>
substantial fraction of the air exited through the cyclone dust slots and then re-<br>
entered through the re-entry tubes 340. Increasing the re-entry tube 340 size,<br>
adding shields 335 or blocking some re-entry tubes 340 did not change the<br>
gross circulating pattern in the settling chamber 328.<br>
The performance of the different cyclone configurations tested in this<br>
example were compared on the basis of their collection efficiencies and<br>
residual catalyst with size greater than 10 urn in the clean gas. The<br>
configurations tested were:<br>
♦	Base design (1" re-entry tubes 340 and without shields 335)<br>
♦	Cyclone with 1" re-entry tubes 340 and shields 335<br>
♦	Cyclone with 3" re-entry tubes 340 and shields 335<br>
Adding shields 335 to the cyclone 322 with the 1" re-entry tube 340<br>
increased efficiency from 83.7 to 90%. Enlarging the re-entry tube 340<br>
diameter from nominal 1" to nominal 3" decreased the collection efficiency by<br>
almost 2%.<br>
The effects of varying the underflow percent (1-5%), nominal cyclone<br>
inlet velocity (100-250 ft/s), dust loading, plugged re-entry tubes, plugged swirl<br>
vanes, plugged inlet window, finer particle size, and larger re-entry tube size (2-<br>
and 3-in.), were also investigated.<br>
The effect of underflow rate on the cyclone 322 performance was<br>
studied systematically at cyclone inlet velocity of 195 ft/s for the base cyclone<br>
design without shields. The results showed that the cydone efficiency<br><br>
-22-<br>
increased with underflow rate up to 4% underflow rate and then the efficiency<br>
appeared to show a slight decrease as the underflow rate increased. The<br>
cyclone efficiency for the 3" re-entry tube cyclone appeared to be insensitive to<br>
underflow rate above 4%. The slight drop in efficiency beyond 4% underflow<br>
rate for the base design could have been due to increased turbulence in the<br>
settling chamber as a result of the separated catalyst particles. The presence<br>
of shields and reduction in the re-entry velocity for the cyclones with the 3" re-<br>
entry tubes and shields appeared to reduce the re-entrainment of catalyst<br>
particles as the underflow rate was increased. Increasing the underflow rate at<br>
constant cyclone inlet velocity did not increase the amount of +10 |im materials<br>
in the clean gas.<br>
The effects of cyclone inlet velocity at constant underflow rate of 3% on<br>
the performance of the base cyclone design showed that cyclone efficiency<br>
increased from approximately 81% through a maximum of 87% and then<br>
dropped slightly as the cyclone inlet velocity was increased from 110 ft/s to 249<br>
ft/s. The maximum efficiency occurred at a cyclone inlet velocity of 200 ft/s.<br>
Below a cyclone inlet velocity of 185 ft/s, all catalyst particles collected from the<br>
clean gas were less than 10 urn in diameter. The concentration of +10 jim<br>
particles in the clean gas increased sharply at cyclone inlet velocities greater<br>
than 190 ft/s. At the maximum velocity investigated, the concentration of +10<br>
ixm particles was 10 mg/Nm3.<br>
The cyclone pressure drop between the inlet and outlet plenums<br>
increased with cyclone 322 inlet velocity. The cyclone 322 pressure drop was<br>
generally related to the cyclone 322 inlet velocity by the following equation:<br>
AP = 0.001 07 pVel18	(1)<br>
The pressure drop between the inlet and the settling chamber 328 also<br>
increased with inlet velocity. The pressure drop increased with increase in re-<br>
entry tube 340 size. This was because the cyclone 322 gas efflux from the<br>
solids exit slot increased as the diameter of the re-entry tube was increased.<br>
The swirl vane 324 pressure drop was generally related to the cyclone<br>
322 inlet velocity as:<br><br><br><br>
Approximately 25% of the cyclone 322 pressure drop was taken through<br>
the swirl vanes 324.<br>
The particle size distributions of catalyst in the clean gas at 195 ft/s (with<br>
6 cyclones) and at 244 ft/s (with 4 cyclones) showed that there were particles in<br>
the clean gas larger than 10 μm when the cyclones were operated at a higher<br>
inlet velocity. The PSD at 244 ft/s inlet velocity displayed two cut sizes, one at<br>
approximately 6 μm and the other at approximately 50 μm. The material<br>
between 6 and 50 μm appears to come from re-entrainment of catalyst from the<br>
settling chamber 328 when the cyclone inlet velocity was increased. These<br>
cyclones did not have shields 335. The first cut diameter for the higher inlet<br>
velocity was smaller than the cut diameter at the lower cyclone inlet velocity.<br>
This showed that the cyclone efficiency increased as the inlet velocity was<br>
increased.<br>
The re-entry tube 340 velocity was determined at constant underflow<br>
rate of 3% from helium tracer measurement. The re-entry tube 340 velocity<br>
increased when the cyclone inlet velocity was increased because more gas<br>
exited through the dust slot into the settling chamber 328. At the refinery<br>
cyclone inlet design velocity, the re-entry tube 340 velocity measured from the<br>
helium tracer was several orders of magnitude greater than had been<br>
assumed.<br>
The performance of the TSS with finer inlet dust particle size distribution<br>
was studied by injecting fines compared with the feed blend PSD used for the<br>
rest of the tests. The fines had 66% of catalyst particles less than 10 urn,<br>
whereas the normal feed blend had only 24% of the catalyst particles less than<br>
10 μm. The test was performed with the cyclones 322 having 3" re-entry tubes<br>
340 and shields 335. At approximately the same inlet velocity and dust<br>
loading, the cyclone efficiency decreased by 21 % with feed of finer particle size<br>
distribution. However, the size distribution of catalyst fines in the clean gas<br>
was not affected by the feed size. There were no 10+ μm particles in the clean<br>
gas even when the cyclone was fed with 66% of less than 10 μm particles.<br>
This suggested that the grade efficiency of the cyclone 322 was constant and<br>
independent of inlet particle size distribution.<br><br><br>
The effect of the inlet dust loading on the performance of the cyclones<br>
was characterized by studying its collection efficiency at different inlet dust<br>
loading. The inlet dust loading was varied between 400 mg/Nm3 and 900<br>
mg/Nm3. The cyclones 322 used had shields 335 and 3" re-entry tubes 340.<br>
The results showed that the cyclone 322 efficiency increased with inlet dust<br>
loading by about 6% when the dust loading to the cyclone 322 was doubled.<br>
The effect of the re-entry tube 340 diameter on the cyclone performance<br>
was studied. Two re-entry tube 340 sizes of 2.02" (nominal 2") and 2.97"<br>
(nominal 3") ID were studied in addition to the 1.049" (nominal 1") re-entry tube<br>
340 of the base design. Shields 335 were also installed on the cyclones 322.<br>
The investigation of the performance of the cyclones 322 with the three re-entry<br>
tube 340 sizes showed that there was a slight reduction in the cyclone<br>
efficiency when the re-entry tube 340 was enlarged from 1.029" to 2.97" ID.<br>
The performance of the largest re-entry tube 340 was approximately the same<br>
as that of the cyclone 322 with 1" re-entry tube 340 without shields 335;<br>
however, there were no +10 μm particles in the clean outlet gas.<br>
Enlarging the re-entry tube 340 from 1.049" to 2.97" resulted in a<br>
decrease in the re-entry tube 340 velocity from 400 ft/s to 100 ft/s, respectively.<br>
Though the re-entry tube 340 velocity decreased, the amount of gas exiting<br>
from the dust slot also increased, which resulted in more net flow of gas<br>
entering the cyclone 322 through the re-entry tube 340 at constant underflow<br>
rate. The turbulence in the settling chamber 328 therefore increased as the re-<br>
entry tube 340 size was increased, at constant underflow rate. Nevertheless,<br>
the reduction in the re-entry gas velocity reduced the amount of catalyst re-<br>
entrainment from the settling chamber 328.<br>
The investigation of the effect of re-entry tube 340 diameter on TSS<br>
outlet particle size distributions (PSD) showed that the cut point of outlet PSD<br>
decreased from 5 μm to 3 μm when the re-entry tube 340 was enlarged from<br>
1.049" to 2.02" or 2.97". Enlarging the re-entry tube 340 size can improve the<br>
operability of the unit without significant loss of cyclone 322 efficiency.<br>
A test without the inlet baffle was performed to determine if removal of<br>
the inlet baffle would result in gas and catalyst maldistribution to the cyclones<br>
322 and affect their performance. This was in response to a suspicion that the<br><br><br>
presence of the inlet baffle might cause the upper windows to be plugged with<br>
refractory debris. The cyclones 322 used in this test had shields 335 and 3"<br>
nominal re-entry tubes 340. The results showed that the removal of the inlet<br>
baffle did not negatively impact the collection efficiency of the cyclones and<br>
there were no 10+ μm particles in the clean gas stream exiting the cyclones.<br>
The inlet pressure drop was lower without the inlet baffle.<br>
A single test was run to study the effect of the dust exit slot size on the<br>
cyclone performance. This test was performed with cyclones 322 with 3"<br>
nominal re-entry tubes 340 and shields 335 at an underflow of 3%. The dust<br>
exit slot width was decreased from the 1.5" used in the base design to 1.0".<br>
The slot height of 2.5" was not changed. The results were compared with<br>
cyclones 322 with the standard slot width of 1.5". Decreasing the slot width at<br>
constant underflow rate resulted in an approximately 4% decrease in the<br>
cyclone 322 efficiency; but the pressure drop across the cyclones 322 was not<br>
affected. The gas flow rate out of the slot did not change, but its velocity<br>
increased by approximately 87 ft/s due to reduction in the slot area. This might<br>
have caused an increase in the turbulence in the settling chamber 328, thus<br>
leading to higher re-entrainment of catalyst. It was also plausible that when the<br>
slot width was decreased, it inhibited the outflow of dust from the cyclone 322,<br>
causing internal re-entrainment of the dust into the vortex to increase.<br>
The results of plugging the re-entry tubes 340, run with 25% of the re-<br>
entry tubes 340 plugged (one re-entry tube 340), were compared with data<br>
from two tests that were run under similar conditions with re-entry tubes 340<br>
unplugged. Based on the data, plugging 1 out of every 4 re-entry tubes 340 did<br>
not appear to negatively impact the effectiveness of the cyclone system. It also<br>
did not change the pressure drop across the cyclones 322.<br>
A curved Plexiglas plate (not shown) was used to cover the upper inlet<br>
window 320 to simulate the effect of a plugged inlet window in the commercial<br>
unit. The results showed that plugging the inlet window neither affected the<br>
cyclone collection efficiency nor caused the loss of +10 μm particles in clean<br>
gas. However, it did increase the pressure drop across the inlet pipe because<br>
all the gas passed through the lower window.<br><br><br>
Another test was conducted to investigate the effect of completely<br>
plugging the swirl vanes 324 of some cyclones 322 while leaving their dust exit<br>
slot, re-entry tubes 322 and gas outlet tubes open. The test was run with four<br>
functioning cyclones 322, while two non-functioning cyclones (322B, 322E)<br>
were left blocked with their dust exit slots, re-entry tubes 340 and gas outlet<br>
tubes left open. The results showed a significant drop in the cyclone collection<br>
efficiency resulting in a sharp increase in 10+ μm particles in the clean gas<br>
exiting the cyclones 322. Blocking or plugging the swirl vanes 324 resulted in<br>
gross gas and solids short-circuiting between the settling chamber 328 and the<br>
outlet plenum 344. This created a vacuum effect that cleaned off all the dust<br>
particles that usually stuck to the walls and flanges after the run, and there was<br>
little dust collection in the settling chamber 328. This failure mode, among the<br>
three that were studied, was the most catastrophic to the operation of the<br>
cyclone system. It resulted in the immediate deterioration in performance.<br>
Partial blockage of the swirl vanes 324 could produce the same effect, but it<br>
would be less dramatic.<br>
The results from the cold flow modeling described above showed that<br>
the presence of large particles in the clean outlet gas of the TSS without the<br>
shields was caused by re-entrainment of already separated catalyst particles<br>
from the settling chamber. There was a strong degree of turbulence and<br>
clockwise motion of separated particulates in the settling chamber. The<br>
gas/solids exit velocity from the cyclone was found to be higher than design<br>
and, as a consequence, catalyst particles exiting were projected closely to the<br>
entrance of the gas re-entry tubes of adjacent cyclones. The velocity of the gas<br>
entering the cyclone through the re-entering tube was several orders of<br>
magnitude higher than assumed for the design and this caused secondary re-<br>
entrainment of catalyst particles from the settling chamber. Addition of shields<br>
to the bottom of the cyclones was found to eliminate cross talk and reduced<br>
secondary re-entrainment that eliminated the +10 micron particles from the<br>
clean gas.<br>
In addition to installation of the shield, the following two additional<br>
modifications were found to improve operability of the unit: (1) enlargement of<br>
the re-entry tube from nominal 1 inch to nominal 3 inches, causing a slight<br><br>
decrease in the overall collection efficiency of the TSS, but reducing a tendency<br>
of the re-entry tubes to plug; and (2) removal of the inlet baffle to eliminate<br>
possible pluggage of the upper windows with refractory debris. This did not<br>
impact the cyclone performance in the cold flow unit.<br>
Examples - Hypothetical Catalyst Fines<br>
Another example of the effect of the shields on the TSS performance is to<br>
estimate the TSS performance with a hypothetical catalyst fines composition in<br>
the inlet gas stream, based on the cold flow modeling results. Assuming<br>
uniform particle sizes of 5, 10, 20 and 60 microns, the efficiency, collection rate<br>
and particle loss to clean gas for unshielded and shielded reflux tubes based<br>
on the data from the cold flow modeling are shown in Tables 3 and 4,<br>
respectively.<br><br><br><br>
