				<td>This invention relates to lubricating compositions, especially gear oil compositions having good low and high temperature viscometrics and which exhibit good shear stability. More specifically, the invention relates to combinations of polymers and fluidizing agents which provide good viscometrics and shear stability.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Multigrade lubricants are preferred because of their ability to operate under broad temperature ranges. High molecular weight polymers have been used in multigrade lubricants to maintain oil viscosity as equipment operating temperatures increase. A problem with the use of high molecular weight polymers is their shear stability. Shear stability describes the polymer's ability to maintain oil viscosity after exposure to shearing conditions. Shear stability is a measure of the loss of polymer's ability to provide thickening to a fluid. This loss is typically referred to as permanent shear loss (PSL). One way of measuring permanent shear loss is the Taper Bearing Shear Test (DIN 350-06). The viscosity of a lubricant is measured before and after the test and the percentage of shear loss is reported. Today's lubricating compositions are exposed to high shear conditions, such as gear driveline applications. A need exists for multigrade shear stable lubricants, such as gear lubricants.<br>
Low molecular weight polymers, e.g. Mw less than 50,000, may be used to prepare multigrade lubricants. Often high treat rates for the low molecular weight polymers are required to obtain appropriate viscosity. A disadvantage of these polymers is their effect on low temperature viscometrics as measured in the Brookfield viscometer. Multigrade lubricants must have acceptable low temperature properties, e.g. acceptable viscosity at low temperatures.<br>
Multigrade lubricants have been made from synthetic, e.g., polyalphaolefin fluids, and natural base fluids. However, the cost of the synthetic fluids is very high compared to mineral oils. With mineral oils (e.g. up to SAE<br>
250N), it is difficult to obtain good viscometrics, i.e. kinematic viscosity and/or Brookfield viscosity. More specifically, the amount of polymer needed to thicken the oil at high temperatures causes undesirable low temperature viscosity.<br>
Lubricating compositions serve to remove heat from operating equipment and to reduce metal-metal contact which lead to wearing. Today many pieces of equipment are reduced in size, which in turn has led to higher operating temperatures for the equipment. These higher temperatures, along with exposure to oxidizing media, such as air or water, may lead to increased oxidation of the lubricating composition. Today the drain intervals for lubricants have increased. When a lubricant has to operate for longer periods at higher temperatures, the lubricant is prone to viscosity increase. The viscosity increase is believed to be caused by polymerization of oxidized components of the lubricants. This increased viscosity renders the lubricant unfit for use. It is therefore desirable to have lubricants with improved oxidation resistance. More particularly, it is desirable to have lubricants which will withstand long periods of operation at high temperatures.<br>
It is desirable to have ingredients which can form multigrade lubricants, especially gear, transmission and differential lubricants with good low and high temperature viscometrics and acceptable shear stability. A need exists for components which can provide the desired viscometrics for mineral oil based lubricants while also being shear stable and have good low temperature performance. Additionally a need exist for lubricants which can meet the above requirements and which provide improved oxidation resistance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a lubricating composition comprising at least about 30% by weight at least one mineral oil, having a kinematic viscosity of less than about 8 define at 100°C, (A) from about 15% to about 40% by weight of at least one polymer, and (B) up to about 30% by weight of at least one fluidizing agent, provided that when the fluidizing agent is a polyα-olefin having a kinematic viscosity from about 2 to about 30 cSt at 100°C, then the polya-olefin is present in an amount up to about 12% by weight, wherein the lubricating composition has a shear loss of<br>
less than about 15% in the 20 hour Taper Bearing Shear Test. The invention also relates to concentrates used in preparing shear stable lubricating compositions. The present combination of components provides good low and high temperature properties especially when used in combination with one or more mineral oils. In one aspect, the compositions provide improved oxidation resistance.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" includes hydrocarbon as well as substantially hydrocarbon groups. Substantially hydrocarbon describes groups which contain heteroatom substituents that do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include the following:<br>
(1)	hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl)<br>
and alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, aromatic-, aliphatic- and<br>
alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents and the like as well as cyclic substituents<br>
wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (that is, for<br>
example, any two indicated substituents may together form an alicyclic radical);<br>
(2)	substituted hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., those substituents<br>
containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, hi the context of this invention, do not<br>
alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent; those skilled in the art<br>
will be aware of such groups (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy,<br>
mercapto, nitro, nitroso, sulfoxy, etc.);<br>
(3)	heteroatom substituents, i.e., substituents which will, while<br>
having a predominantly hydrocarbon character within the context of this invention,<br>
contain an atom other than carbon present in a ring or chain otherwise composed of<br>
carbon atoms (e.g., alkoxy or alkylthio).   Suitable heteroatoms will be apparent to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art and include, for example, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen<br>
and such substituents as, e.g. pyridyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, etc.<br>
In general, no more than about 2, preferably no more than one heteroatom substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group. Typically, there will be no such heteroatom substituents hi the hydrocarbyl group. Therefore, the hydrocarbyl group is hydrocarbon.<br>
As described above, the lubricating compositions and concentrates contain a combination of ingredients which provides good low and high temperature viscometrics and good shear stability. Shear stability is measured in the 20 hour taper bearing shear test. The Tapered Bearing Shear Test is a published standard test entitled "Viscosity Shear Stability of Transmission Lubricants" and is described in CEC L-45-T-93 available from CEC, 61 New Cavendish Street, London WIM 8AR, England. The same test is also published as DIN 51 350, part 6 and is available from Deutsches Institue fur Normung, Burggrfenshase 6, 1000 Berlin 30, Germany. Both references are hereby incorporated by reference. The lubricating compositions generally give a shear loss of less than 20%, preferably less than about 18%, more preferably less than about 15% in the tapered bearing shear test. Also the lubricating compositions provide a Brookfield viscosity of less than about 160,000, or less about 150,000, or less than about 140,000 cPs at -40°C. Typically, the lubricating compositions have a Brookfield viscosity of greater than 20,000, or greater than 40,000 or, greater than about 50,000 cPs at -40°C.<br>
The lubricating compositions are prepared from a mineral oil having a kinematic viscosity of less than 8, or less than about 7, or less than about 6 cSt at 100°C. Of course, it is understood that the mineral oil must have sufficient viscosity to act as a lubricating oil. Typically, the mineral oil has a kinematic viscosity of at least about 2, or at least about 3, or at least about 4 cSt at 100°C. In one embodiment, the kinematic viscosity of the mineral oils is from about 3.0 to about 7.5, or from about 3.3 to about 7.0, or from about 3.4 to about 6.5.

In another embodiment, the oil of lubricating viscosity has less than 0.3%, or less than 0.1 % sulfur. In another embodiment, the<br>
mineral oil is other than petroleum bright stock.   In one aspect, the lubricating compositions are free of petroleum bright stock.<br>

Specific mineral oils include hydrotreated mineral oils, solvent refined mineral oils, isomerized wax oils, solvent refined and acid treated mineral oils, etc. Typically, the mineral oils will have an SAE designation up to about 250 N, or up to about 150 N. Useful oils include VON, 100N, 130N, 150N and 200N mineral oils. In one embodiment, the mineral oil is a petroleum oil or a hydrotreated petroleum oil. Examples of useful oils of lubricating viscosity include isomerized wax basestocks, such as 100N isomerized wax basestocks, 120N isomerized wax basestocks, 170N isomerized wax basestocks, and 250N isomerized wax basestocks; refined basestocks, such as 250N solvent refined paraffinic mineral oils, 200N solvent refined naphthenic mineral oils, 100N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oils, 240N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oils, 80N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oils, and 150N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oils. A description of mineral oils occurs in U.S. Patent 4,582,618 (column 2, line 37 through column 3, line 63, inclusive), herein incorporated by reference for its disclosure to oils of lubricating viscosity. Polymer (A)<br>
The lubricating compositions additionally contain (A) at least one polymer. The polymer generally is present in an amount from about 15% to about 40%, or from about 18% to about 35%, or from about 20% to about 30% by weight of the lubricating composition.

In one embodiment, the polymer (A) is characterized by an Mn (number average molecular weight) of up to about 6000, or up to about 5000. Generally, the polymer is characterized by having an Mn from about 800 to about 6000, or from about 900 to about 5000, or from about 1000 to 4000.

In one embodiment, the polymer may be a sheared polymer of higher molecular weight, e.g. greater than Mw 50,000. In this embodiment, a higher molecular weight polymer is sheared to the desired molecular weight. The shearing may be done in any suitable apparatus, such as an extruder, an injector, an FZG apparatus, etc.<br>
The abbreviation Mw and Mn is the conventional symbol representing weight average and number average molecular weight, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is a method which provides both molecular weights as well as the entire molecular weight distribution of the polymers. For purpose of this invention a series of fractionated polymers of isobutene, polyisobutene, is used as the calibration standard in the GPC. The techniques for determining Mn and Mw values of polymers are well known and are described in numerous books and articles. For example, methods for the determination of Mn and molecular weight distribution of polymers is described in W.W. Yan, J.J. Kirkland and D.D. Bly, "Modern Size Exclusion Liquid Chromatographs", J.

disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference for its discussion of this procedure for<br>
preparing sulfurized olefins and the sulfurized olefins thus produced.<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfur compound is an organic poly sulfide. The sulfur compound may also be prepared by reacting, under superatmospheric pressure, the olefin with a mixture of sulfur and hydrogen sulfide in the presence, or absence, of a catalyst, followed by removal of low boiling materials. The olefins which may be sulfurized, the sulfurized olefin, and methods of preparing the same are described in U.S. Patents 4,119,549,4,199,550, 4,191,659, and 4,344,854.

Higher polysulfides are defined as containing four or more sulfide linkages. In one embodiment, the amount of trisulfide is at least about 92%, or preferably at least about 93%. In another embodiment, the amount of dihydrocarbyl<br>
higher polysulfides is less than 4%, or preferably less than about 3%. In one embodiment, the dihydrocarbyl disulfide is present in an amount from about 0.1%, or from about 0.5% to about 5%, or from about 0.6% to about 3%.<br>
The sulfide analysis is performed on a Varian 6000 Gas Chromatograph and FID detector SP-4100 computing integrator. The Column is a 25 m. Megabore SGE BP-1. The temperature profile is 75oC, hold 2 min., to 250oC at 6'C/min. The helium flow is 6.0 ml/min plus make-up. The injection temperature is 200oC and the detector temperature is 260oC. The injection size is 0.6 ul. References are the monosulfide, disulfide and trisulfide analogues to the sulfur composition for analysis. The references may be obtained by fractionating the product to form sulfide fractions (S1, S2 and S3) to be used for analysis. The procedure for analysis is as follows. (1) An area % determination is run on each of the reference samples to determine its purity. (2) An area % determination is run on the sample to be tested to get a general idea of its composition. (3) A calibration blend is accurately weighed based on the area % results of the sample to be tested: then the internal standard toluene, is added to the blend in an amount equal to approximately one-half of the weight of the largest component. (This should give an area approximately the same as that of the largest component.) (4) The weights of each component (i.e., S-l, S-2 and S-3) are corrected by the % purity from step 1. (5) The calibration blend is run in triplicate using the corrected weights and then calculated, using the following formula, to reflect the multiple peaks in S-l and S-2:<br>
RF = (concentration of components*) (      area of internal standard      )<br>
(     total area of peaks	) (concentration of internal standard)<br>
* Adjusted for purity of the standard i.e.: component weight times percent purity equals concentration of component.<br>
(6) These response factors, plus the response factor for the single S-3 peak are used for determining weight percent results for the samples to be tested. (7) Results for S-l and S-2 are adjusted to include all the peaks attributed to them. (8)<br>
Higher polysulfides are determined by difference using the following formula:<br>
S-4 = 100% - (S-l + S-2 + S-3 + light ends) Light ends are defined as any peaks eluded prior to the internal standard.<br>
In one embodiment, the sulfur compound is prepared by reacting, optionally under superatmospheric pressure, one or more of the above olefins with a mixture of sulfur and hydrogen sulfide in the presence, or absence, of a catalyst, such as an alkylamine catalyst, followed by removal of low boiling materials. The olefins which may be sulfurized, the sulfurized olefin, and methods of preparing the same are described in U.S. Patents 4,119,549,4,199,550,4,191,659, and 4,344,854. The disclosure of these patents is hereby incorporated by reference for its description of the sulfurized olefins and preparation of the same. The polysulfide thus produced is fractionally distilled. In one aspect, the fractional distillation occurs under subatmospheric pressure. Typically the distillation pressure is from about 1 to about 250, from about 1 to about 100, or from about 1 to about 25 mm Hg. A fractionation column such as Snyder fractionation column may be used. In one embodiment, the fractionation is carried out at a reflux ratio from about 1:1 to about 15:1, or from about 2:1 to about 10:1, or from about 3:1 toabout8:l. The fraction distillation occurs at a temperature at which the sulfur composition which is being fractionated boils. Typically the fractional distillation occurs at a pot temperature from about 75°C to about 300°C, or from about 90°C to about 200°C.<br>
The conditions of fractional distillation are determined by the sulfur composition being distilled. Typically, the sulfur compound is heated to a temperature at which boiling occurs. The distillation system is brought to equilibrium and the distillation commences with a chosen reflux ratio. The fractions obtained from the distillation are removed from the distillation apparatus. The amount of the desired fraction may be calculated by determining the proportion of sulfides. The desired fraction is obtained by maintaining accurate temperature control on the distillation system. The boiling fractions are removed at a specific vapor and temperature for<br>
that fraction. The reflux ratio is adjusted to maintain the temperature at which this fraction boils. After removal of the desired fraction, the fraction may be further filtered as desired.<br>
In general, fractionation is carried out hi a continuous or a batch process. In a continuous process, the material to be fractionated is fed to a fractionating column. Parameters are controlled in the system, such as feed flow, temperatures throughout the column, and the reflux ratio, etc., to separate the components in the feed into an overhead and bottoms stream. These parameters are adjusted to maintain the desired composition in the overhead and bottoms streams.<br>
For a batch process, the material to be fractionated is charged to a vessel and is heated to boiling temperatures with agitation. Once the material reaches the boiling point, the fractionation column system is brought to equilibrium. Subsequently, the desired reflux ratio is set. Collection of the distillate is commenced, as described herein. The reflux ratio is increased as is necessary to maintain the appropriate temperatures hi the fractionating column system. As the distillation rate slows, the reflux ratio is increased until eventually the collection of the distillate stops. The different fractions are separated as the above process is repeated at higher temperatures.<br>
The following examples relate to sulfurized olefins. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, here, as well as throughout the specification and claims, the amounts are by weight, the temperature is hi degrees Celsius and the pressure is atmospheric.<br>
Example S-l<br>
Sulfur (526 parts, 16.4 moles) is charged to a jacketed, high-pressure reactor which is fitted with an agitator and internal cooling coils. Refrigerated brine is circulated through the coils to cool the reactor prior to the introduction of the gaseous reactants. After sealing the reactor, evacuating to about 2 torr and cooling, 920 parts (16.4 moles) of isobutene and 279 parts (8.2 moles) of hydrogen sulfide are charged to the reactor. The reactor is heated using steam hi the external jacket, to a temperature of about 182°C over about 1.5 hours. A maximum pressure of 1350psig is reached at about 168°C during this heat-up. Prior to reaching the peak reaction temperature, the pressure starts to decrease and continues to decrease steadily as the gaseous reactants are consumed. After about 10 hours at a reaction temperature of about 182°C, the pressure is 310-340 psig and the rate of pressure change is about 5-10 psig per hour. The unreacted hydrogen sulfide and isobutene are vented to a recovery system. After the pressure in the reactor has decreased to atmospheric, the sulfurized mixture is recovered as a liquid. The mixture is blown with nitrogen at about 100°C to remove low boiling materials including unreacted isobutene, mercaptans and monosulfides. The residue after nitrogen blowing is agitated with 5% Super Filtrol and filtered, using a diatomaceous earth filter aid. The filtrate is the desired sulfurized composition which contains 42.5% sulfur.<br>
Example S-2<br>
Sulfur monochloride (2025 grams, 15.0 moles) is heated to 45°C. Through a sub-surface gas sparge, 1468 grams (26.2 moles) of isobutylene gas are fed into the reactor over a 5-hour period. The temperature is maintained between 45-50°C. At the end of the sparging, the reaction mixture increases in weight to 1352 grams. In a separate reaction vessel are added 2150 grams (16.5 moles) of 60% flake sodium sulfide, 240 grams (7.5 moles) sulfur, and a solution of 420 ml. of isopropanol in 4000 ml. of water. The contents are heated to 40°C. The adduct of the sulfur monochloride and isobutylene previously prepared is added over a three-quarter hour period while permitting the temperature to rise to 75 °C. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours, and afterward the mixture is permitted to form into separate layers. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The upper organic layer is mixed with two liters of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours. The organic layer is again removed and washed with one liter of water. The washed product is dried by heating at 90°C and 30 mm. Hg. pressure for 30 minutes. The residue is filtered through diatomaceous earth filter aid to give 2070 grams of a clear yellow-orange liquid.<br>
Example S-3<br>
The product of Example S-l (1000 Ibs.) is charged to a reactor, under medium agitation, and heat to approximately 88 °C - 94 °C. The reaction mixture is brought to equilibrium and the equilibrium is maintained for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. The reflux ratio is set at 4:1. The temperature is raised to 105 °C to ensure a steady distillation rate. Distillation is continued for approximately 20-24 hours and yields approximately 230-260 Ibs. The temperature is raised to 105 °C -107°C. The system is brought to equilibrium and the equilibrium is maintained for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. The reflux ratio is set at 4:1. The temperature is raised to 121 °C - 124°C, in order to ensure a steady distillation rate. The distillate is collected over 75-100 hours. The distillation yields approximately 300-400 Ibs. of the desired product. The desired product contains 2-5% S2, 91-95% S3, and 1-2% S4.<br>
Example S-4<br>
In a vessel with a fractionation column, the product of Example S-l (10,000 grams) is brought to a boil, approximately 200°F, under medium agitation. The column is brought to equilibrium by regulating the vapor temperature. The equilibrium is maintained for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. The reflux ratio is set at 5:1. Under these conditions, the distillate is collected until the accumulation of distillate is less than 5 ml hi 15 minutes. The distillate (100 ml, 88 grams) is collected at a vapor temperature of 56 °C. The temperature of the vessel is raised 15 °F. An additional aliquot of 50 grams of distillate is removed , at a vapor temperature of 58°C. Distillate (1863) is collected and is removed. The collection is continued as long as the distillate rate stays greater than 5 ml/ 15 minutes. If boiling drops off, the temperature of the vessel is raised 5.5°C. Collection of distillate is continued until the distillation rate is less than 5 ml/15 minutes. The distillate contains approximately 473 grams of desired product. For the final collection of distillate, the temperature of the vessel is raised 9°C to 116°C, not exceeding 121 °C. Distillate (220 ml, 214 grams) is removed at a vapor temperature of 69 °C. Collection of the remainder of the distillate (4114 grams) is continued until<br>
the distillation rate is less than 5 ml/15 minutes. A yield after fractionation should approximate 6777 grams of the desired product. The desired product contains approximately 2% S2, 95.6% S3, and 0.15% S4.<br>

Typically, R' is an acyclic straight or branched alkylene group such as an ethylene, propylene, 1,2-butene, 1,2-octadecene, etc. group. Where two R', groups are present in the same molecule they can be joined by a direct carbon-to-carbon bond or through a heteroatom (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur) to form a 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-member ring structure.

Primene 81-R (2362 parts, 12.6 moles) is added dropwise to the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature between about 30-50'C. When all of the amine has been added, the reaction mixture is filtered through a filter aid, and the filtrate is the desired amine salt containing 7.4% phosphorus (theory, 7.1%).<br>
Example P-6<br>
Phosphorus pentoxide (852 grams) is added to 2340 grams of iso-octyl alcohol over a period of 3 hours. The temperature increases from room temperature but is maintained below 65 °C.

The term "alkylphenol sulfldes" is meant to include di-(alkylphenol) monosulfides, disulfides, and polysulfides, as well as other products obtained by the reaction of the alkylphenol with sulfur monochloride, sulfur dichlor-ide or elemental sulfur. One mole of phenol typically is reacted with about 0.5-1.5 moles, or higher, of sulfur compound. For example, the alkylphenol sulfldes are readily obtained by mixing, one mole of an alkylphenol and 0.5-2.0 moles of sulfur dichloride. The reaction mixture is usually maintained at about 100°C for about 2-5 hours, after which time the resulting sulfide is dried and filtered. When elemental sulfur is used, temperatures from about 150-250°C or higher are typically used. It is also desirable that die drying operation be conducted under nitrogen or a similar inert gas. A particularly useful alkylphenol sulfide is thio-bis(tetrapropenylphenate).<br>
