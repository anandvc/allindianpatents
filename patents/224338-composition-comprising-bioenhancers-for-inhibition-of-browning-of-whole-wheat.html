COMPOSITION COMPRISING BIOENHANCERS FOR INHIBITION OF BROWNING OF WHOLE WHEAT<br>
WE, ADVANCED ENZYME TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, A COMPANY ORGANISED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF INDIA WHOSE ADDRESS IS SUN MAGNECTICA, 5TH FLOOR NEAR LIC SERVICE ROAD, LOUIS WADI THANE-400 604, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE  MANNER  IN  WHICH  IT  IS  TO  BE<br><br><br>
Technical Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to the use of scientifically blended bioenhancers with browning inhibitors to irreversibly modify the phenolic substrate, which in turn inactivates poly phenol oxidase in whole wheat. The resultant product has controlled browning effect than that compared to natural whole wheat dough. The present invention attributes technologically and economically to the life of common man through the improvement and benefits brought about herein.<br>
Background of Invention and Prior Art:<br>
Browning of foods during processing and storage, especially during manufacture of meat, fish, fruit and vegetable products decreases the sensory properties of products due to associated changes in colour, flavour and softening, besides nutritional properties. Therefore, its control is essential to preserve the quality of the food. Appearance, flavour, texture and nutritional value are four attributes considered by consumers when making food choices. Appearance, which is significantly impacted by colour, is one of the first attributes used by consumers in evaluating food quality. Colour may be influenced by naturally occurring pigments such as chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins in food, or by pigments resulting from both enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<br>
Enzymatic browning is a significant problem in a number of important commodities, specially fruits such as apricots, apples, pears, peaches, bananas and grapes; vegetables such as potatoes, mushrooms ,lettuce and sea food. This discoloration limits the shelf life as well as the acceptance of the product.<br>
The major enzymatic browning is caused by poly phenol oxidase enzyme present inherently in the fruits, vegelabJes, cereaJs etc. Mechanism of browning due to poly phenol oxidase can be explained as follows:<br>
Enzymatic browning is the discoloration that results when monophenolic compounds of plants or shellfish, in the presence of atmospheric oxygen and poly phenol oxidase (PPO), are hydroxylated to ortho phenols, and the latter are oxidized to ortho quinines. The quinine condenses and reacts nonenzymatically with other phenolic compounds to produce dark brown, black or red pigment of intermediate structure.<br>
2<br><br>
Many approaches have been done in fruits but not in whole wheat. The present invention is related to the prevention of enzymatic browning in whole wheat dough by using a blend of bioenhancers.<br>
Whole wheat is nutritious than white wheat. This is because whole wheat retains bran layer containing iron (non-haem), zinc, copper, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin which are water solubles. Whole wheat aleuronic layer of cells contains valuable nutrients like vitamins B complex, vitamin E and minerals.<br>
The present invention is related to prevent the enzymatic browning in chapatti, breads, rotis, nans etc made with whole wheat dough. The whole wheat retains the nutritional value with improved visual appearance. The main basis of the present invention is to improve the organoleptic properties of whole wheat products and to retain its nutritional value.<br>
Abstract of EP0903083 discloses process for inhibiting enzymatic browning and maintaining textural quality of fresh peeled potatoes, where a process is disclosed for inhibiting enzymatic browning in raw, peeled potatoes comprising dipping the potatoes in a solution of heated organic acids (45-65°C), followed by treatment in a weakly basic solution to neutralize the potato surface and treatment with reducing agents, and followed by storage in modified atmosphere packaging. The process tends to delay the onset of enzymatic browning and, once browning has begun, limits the extent of enzymatic browning.<br>
Abstract of US6020018 discloses inhibition of enzymatic browning of raw fruit and/or vegetable juice. The juice is treated with at least one sulfated polysaccharide in an amount sufficient to inhibit browning. A promoter may also be present, said promoter is selected from the group consisting of chelating agents, acidulents, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Abstract of W08911227 describes inhibition of enzymatic browning, a process for inhibiting oxidative darkening of foods by treating the food with a protease effective to inhibit oxidative darkening of the food, a composition for inhibiting oxidative darkening and a kit for preparing the composition.<br><br>
Abstract of US 4,814,192 discloses process for preserving raw fruits and vegetables, including juices, comprising treating the products with ascorbic acid-2-phosphate esters and ascorbyl-6-fatty acid esters, individually or in combination. The treatments may be applied in an aqueous carrier and may further comprise other browning inhibitors, polyphenol oxidase inhibitors, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and complexing agents. Treatments tend to delay or prevent the onset of enzymatic browning or, once browning has begun, to limit the extent of enzymatic browning.<br>
Object of the Invention:<br>
The main object of present invention relates to the use of bioenhancers with browning inhibitor in the whole wheat to inactivate the poly phenol oxidase and thereby to reduce the undesirable browning.<br>
The other object of present invention relates to the fact that the nutritional value of the whole wheat flour before and after treatment with formulation of bioenhancers with browning inhibitor is retained without any lowering or deterioration.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a process for modification of phenolic substrates as bioenhancers by inhibiting poly phenol oxidase activity in the whole wheat.<br>
The bioenhancer comprises of specific pentosanases which act on pentosans like pectin, xylan and such like, proteolytic enzymes selected from neutral proteases, papain and such like, redox enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase and such like in combination with reducing agents such as cysteine, glutathione and ascorbic acid with chelating agents such as phosphates, EDTA and such like with some acidulants like fumaric acid, phosphoric acid and citric acid with some stabilizers.<br>
Phenolic substrate modification by bioenhancers in whole wheat formulation comprises of bioenhancers such as pentosanases - 0.1-5%, proteolytic enzyme -0.1-2%, redox enzymes - 0.1-3%, reducing agents such as L-cysteine, ascorbic acid 0.5-6%, stabilizers such as sodium and calcium salts at 7-10% with acidulants such as fumaric acid and maleic acid at 10- 20%, thus phenolic substrate modification by the use of bioenhancers in the range of 0.1 - 0.4 % reduces the rate of browning in the whole wheat flour preparation, yet retaining its nutritional value.<br><br>
Detailed Description:<br>
The present invention claims the composition which consists of blend of bioenhancers like specific pentosanases which act on pentosans like pectin, xylan, cellulose and proteolytic enzymes like neutral proteases, plant protease (papain, bromalein, ficin) and redox enzymes such as catalase, gluconase oxidase and lipoxidase. The bioenhancers are formulated in conjunction with browning inhibiting components like reducing agents namely cysteine, glutathione and ascorbic acid, chelating agents such as phosphates and EDTA. The rate of action of bioenhancers and browning inhibitors can be enhanced with acidulants like fumaric acid, phosphoric acid, ascorbic and citric acid which stabilize the whole browning inhibition in conjunction with calcium, sodium salts and emulsifying agents such as polysorbates.<br>
The present invention discloses the range of composition of  bioenhancer such as<br>
pentosanase - 0.1 - 5%, proteolytic enzyme - 0.1- 2%, redox enzymes 0.1- 3%,<br>
reducing agents 0.5-6%, stabilizers such as sodium and calcium salts at 7-10% with<br>
acidulants 10- 20% and white dextrin, defatted soya flour as inert filler: q.s.<br>
(1) Bioenhancer<br>
The mechanism of bioenhancers can be exploited for the control of undesirable<br>
enzyme activities to inhibit browning effect.<br>
1.	Substrate and/or product modification other than the target enzymes<br>
2.	Direct inactivation of the target enzyme.<br>
3.	Inactivation by secondary reactions of highly reactive products. (i)Pentosanase:<br>
It helps in selective inhibition of browning by irreversible modification of phenolic substrates. Due to distorted phenolic structure of substrate, the active site on the poly phenol oxidase cannot come in contact with the substrates to give 100% reaction thus helping in reducing the browning effect. (ii)Proteolytic enzymes:<br>
The plant proteases like ficin, papain, and bromelain are sulphydryl enzymes of broad specificity, which are very effective browning inhibitors. This inhibitory effect is thought to be due to either binding or hydrolysis at specific sites necessary for poly phenol oxidase activity. (iii)Redox enzymes:<br>
5<br><br>
These bioenhancers are capable of methylating the 3 rd position of 3, 4 dihydroxy aromatic compounds. It was observed to cause irreversible modification of phenolic substrates, thus preventing them from serving as substrates for poly phenol oxidase, thus preventing browning reaction.<br>
(2)	Reducing agents<br>
Reducing agents play a role in the prevention of enzymatic browning either by reducing O-quinones of the phenolic substrates to colorless diphenols, or by reacting irreversibly with O-quinones to form stable colorless products. (i)Ascorbic acid is a strong reducing compound, which is acidic in nature, forms neutral salts with bases and is highly water soluble. Polyphenol oxidase inhibition by ascorbic acid has been attributed to the reduction of enzymatically formed O-quinones to their precursor diphenols. Ascorbic acid is irreversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid during the reduction process, thus preventing browning reaction to the desirable extent.<br>
(ii)Cysteine is an effective inhibitor of enzymatic browning. It is reported to be more effective than bisulphites. Cysteine forms intermediate complex with quinine, which serves as competitive inhibitor of polyphenol oxidase enzyme.<br>
(3)	Acidulants<br>
Acidulants are generally applied in order to maintain the acidity for optimum catalytic activity of an enzyme. Acidulants such as citric acid, malic acid and phosphoric acid are capable of lowering acidity of the system, thus rendering poly phenol oxidase inactive.<br>
(4)	Chelators<br>
Enzymes generally posses metal ions at their active sites. Removal of these ions by chelating agents can therefore render enzymes inactive.<br>
Chelating agents like sodium salt of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, sodium tripolyphosphate with pro-oxidative agents such as copper and iron ions, act through an unshared pair of electrons in their molecular structures which captures the metal ion present in poly phenol oxidase and reduces the browning action.<br>
6<br><br>
(5) Stabilizers:<br>
Salts of sodium and calcium ions stabilize the composition of browning inhibitor<br>
containing bioenhancers.<br>
According to the present invention, bioenhancers were prepared by fermentation using controlled conditions with the help of pressure, adjustments in temperature and using suitable fermentation medium referring to the environment. The fermentation process is carried out by using the fermentation substrate and the carbohydrate source that is metabolized by the fermenting microorganism(s). The fermentation media includes fermentation substrate and other raw materials used in the fermentation process. In the present invention, the fermentation media can bring out liquefaction and saccharification processes or other desired processes prior to or simultaneously with fermentation.<br>
