				<td>A HYDROXYPROPYL METHYL CELLULOSE FILM, METHOD FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND<br>
DELIVERY CAPSULE ENCLOSE BY IT<br>
Field of the invention.<br>
This Invention relates to films of modified polymeric materials, more<br>
particularly of films of the modified cellulose material hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose (HPMC), and uses of such films.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose is a synthetic plastics material, which Is a<br>
modified form of the naturally occurring polymer, cellulose. Films, (or<br>
sheets or membranes) of HPMC are available commercially and have<br>
various uses, including proposals for use as wall materials of delivery<br>
capsules I.e. capsules designed to retain and protect their contents until<br>
an intended site of delivery or conditions of delivery are encountered, at<br>
which point the contents of the capsules are released. HPMC is suitable<br>
for ingestlon by humans, so delivery capsules with HPMC walls find the<br>
potential use as Ingestible capsules, e.g. for the delivery of accurately<br>
metered doses of pharmaceutical preparations and dietary supplements,<br>
as a possible replacement for gelatin based capsules. See for example,<br>
WO 97/35537, WO00/27367 and WO 01/03676,<br>
When producing HPMC films, HPMC is usually treated with a plasticlser in<br>
order to Impart or improve properties of flexibility to the film. Materials<br>
used as plasticisers include polyethylene glycol (PEG), monopropylene<br>
glycol, glycerol and also acetins (which are acetates of glycerol).<br>
In a typical method of making a cast HPMC film, HPMC, PEC and water are<br>
mixed to produce an aqueous solution, followed by optional deaeratlon<br>
of the solution if a non-aerated film is required. The film is then fed in a<br>
controlled manner to the surface of a continuous belt, producing a cast<br>
film of desired thickness which is fed on the belt past heating means for<br>
drying the film. The dried film is then removed from the belt and wound<br>
onto reels.<br>
The present Invention concerns novel plasticiser materials for polymeric<br>
films, more particularly HPMC films.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In one aspect of the present invention provides hydroxypropyl methyl<br>
cellulose film, comprising hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose plastlcised<br>
with a plasticiser comprising an organic acid, or derivative or salt of<br>
such an acid.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention provides hydroxypropyl methyl<br>
cellulose film, comprising hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose plastlcised with<br>
an organic alcohol, derivative or salt of such an alcohol.<br>
Suitable organic acids are carboxylic acids, such as mono, di, tri, or tetra<br>
or other polyvalent carboxylic acids.<br>
Carboxylic acids according to the present Invention include the following:<br>
C1-C6 saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched chain carboxylic<br>
acids, with 1,2,3 or 4 carboxyl groups<br>
C1 -C6 hydroxy acids with any combination of 1,2,3,4 hydroxyl/carboxyl<br>
groups, including beta hydroxy acids (BHA's)<br>
Cyclised acids and cyclised hydroxy acids<br>
Specific examples of acids according to the present Invention include the<br>
following:<br>
unsaturated carboxyiic acids<br>
Adipic acid<br>
Fumerlc acid<br>
Fumaric acid<br>
Maleic acid<br>
Proprionic acid<br>
saturated carboxylie acids<br>
Ethanoic acid<br>
Propanoic acid<br>
Butanoic acid<br>
Pentanolc add<br>
Hexanoic acid<br>
hydroxy adds<br>
Alpha hydroxy butyric acid<br>
Mandellc acid<br>
cyclised acids and cyclised hydroxy acids<br>
Garnma butyrolactone<br>
Cam ma valerolactone<br>
Beta propriolactone<br>
In another aspect of the present invention provides hydroxy propyl<br>
methyl cellulose film, comprising hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose<br>
plasticised with an organic alcohol, derivative or salt of such an alcohol.<br>
Alcohols according to the present invention include C1-C8 substituted or<br>
unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched chain<br>
aliphatic alcohols.<br>
Examples of alcohols according to the present invention incJude the<br>
following:<br>
Benzyl alcohol<br>
Ethanol<br>
Propanol<br>
Isopropanol<br>
Butanol, and structural isomers<br>
Pentanol, and structural isomers<br>
Hexanol, and structural tsomers<br>
The above acids and alcohols are readily available commercially, some or<br>
which are approved for pharmaceutical and food use, so some forms of<br>
HPMC film in accordance with the present invention is suitable for and<br>
approved for food and pharmaceutical use. Some HPMC film In<br>
accordance with the present Invention Is suitable for ingestlon by<br>
humans. Some HPMC film in accordance with the present Invention can<br>
thus be used for ingestlble purposes, e.g. as wall material for ingestible<br>
delivery capsules.<br>
The currently preferred acid plasticiser according to the present Invention<br>
is malelc acid, with fumaric acid and then adipic acid being the next most<br>
favoured. In addition, benzyl alcohol has shown favourable characteristics<br>
for particular purposes.<br>
It Is preferred that the plastidser is in the form of an acid or alcohol<br>
rather than a salt of the acid/alcohol, as the non salt form generally has<br>
better plasticising properties, (although salts Including partial salts e.g.<br>
sodium and potassium salts of the acids/alcohols may be used, and in<br>
particular it may be convenient to use buffered casting solutions).<br>
The acids, particularly maleic acid and alcohols, particularly benzyl<br>
alcohol, are also generally found to have good plasticising properties and<br>
to be capable of producing HPMC films with certain benefits and<br>
advantages as compared with HPMC films prepared using conventional<br>
plastlcisers. These benefits and advantages include the following:<br>
a) The film thermoforms very easily at lower temperatures and using<br>
less energy.<br>
b) The deformed film retains Its shape i.e. the film has no memory.<br>
c) The film readily welds to itself and seals at lower temperatures<br>
using less heat and pressure.<br>
d) The film tastes pleasant and has mouth watering effect.<br>
e) The film has a high gloss appearance, Improving the appearance of<br>
the finished product<br>
f) The plastlciser may comprise one or more materials, including one<br>
or more acids/alcohols and/or one or more salts of the<br>
acid/alcohol, possibly in combination with one or more other<br>
plastlcisers such as those In the prior art e.g. polyethylene glycol,<br>
monopropylene glycol, glycerol and acetins.<br>
The plastldser Is suitably present in an amount In the range of 2-40% by<br>
weight of the total weight of the film, typically about 23% by weight of the<br>
total weight of the film. One preferred film thus comprises about 2396<br>
malelc acid and about 77% by weight HPMC. Where a mixture of<br>
plastcisers Is used, benefits may nevertheless be seen using an acid or<br>
alcohol according to the present Invention, particularly maleic acid, at<br>
lower levels, say 5% by weight of the total weight of the film.<br>
The film may Include optional colourings, e.g. In the form of known food<br>
dyes such as FD and C yellow number 5, optional flavourings, artificial<br>
sweeteners, textures etc., in known manner.<br>
The film may optionally be foamed, expanded or gasified, with small<br>
pockets of gas, e.g. air included In the film structure In known manner.<br>
The minimum thickness of single ply unfoamed film, practically, would be<br>
20 microns and the maximum thickness of single pty foamed film,<br>
practically, would be 300 microns.<br>
The film typically has a thickness in the range 50-200 microns, e.g. in<br>
the range 60-130 microns, more preferably 70 - 90 microns, with the<br>
film thickness being controllable In known manner. Films of different<br>
thickness may be suited to different uses.<br>
The film may be made In generally conventional manner, e.g. as<br>
described above, as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Film in accordance with the Invention finds particular use as wall material<br>
for delivery capsules, as discussed above, particularly for ingestible<br>
capsules. Other uses include, as biodegradeable packaging, water soluble<br>
sachets, carrier material for coating flavours (with flavour Incorporated In<br>
the film or In coating on the film) for enrobing tablets etc.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention further provides a delivery capsule<br>
having an enclosing wall comprising hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose film<br>
in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Such delivery capsules may be made in generally conventional manner<br>
e.g. as disclosed In WO 97/35537, WO 00/27367 and WO 01 /03676.<br>
The invention will be further described, by way of illustration, in the<br>
following example.<br>
Example.<br>
A hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose film in accordance with the invention<br>
was made, having the following composition by weight<br>
Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose 77%<br>
Maleic acid 23%<br>
The film was made in generally conventional manner. HPMC, in the form<br>
of powder, was mixed with maleic acid and water to produce an aqueous<br>
solution with stirring.<br>
The composition of the HPMC casting solution was (%w:w) HPMC 10,<br>
water 87 maleic acid 3. The solution was deaerated by application of a<br>
vacuum.The solution was then fed into a feed hopper, including an<br>
elongate exit slot located a small distance above the upper surface of a<br>
moving conveyor belt to an end thereof, with the slot extending<br>
perpendicularly with respect to the direction of movement of the belt<br>
away from the feed hopper, forming a film. The film was passed on the<br>
belt through a heating zone In which hot air heated the film, driving off<br>
water and so drying the film. The resulting dried cast film was removed<br>
from the belt and wound onto reels. The water content of the dried film<br>
was about 4% by weight, In the form of bound (non-free) water. The<br>
thickness of the dried film was about 120 microns.<br>
The film has certain benefits and advantages as compared with films<br>
prepared using conventional plasticlsers. These include the following:<br>
a) The film thermoforms very easily at lower temperatures and using<br>
less energy.<br>
b) The deformed film retains its shape i.e. the film has no memory.<br>
c) The film readily welds' to itself and seals at lower temperatures<br>
using less heat and pressure.<br>
d) The film tastes pleasant and has mouth watering effect.<br>
e) The film has a high gloss appearance, improving the appearance of<br>
the finished product<br>
The resulting film Is suitable for human consumption, and one use is as a<br>
wall material for ingestible delivery capsules e.g. containing a dose of a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation or a dietary supplement. Such capsules may<br>
be made using known techniques, e.g. as described In WO 97/35537, WO<br>
00/27367 and WO 01 /03676.<br>
