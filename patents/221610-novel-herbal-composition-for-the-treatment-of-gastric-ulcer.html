				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel herbal composition for the treatment of gastric ulcer. The present invention also relates to a method for the preparation of the said composition. The present invention further relates to a process for the treatment of gastric ulcer using the<br>
composition.<br>
Background and prior art to the Invention<br>
Various theories have been proposed with respect to a cause of ulcer in human. In particular, it has been elucidated that stress, taking of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for curing rheumatic diseases, and the like are closely related to ulcer formation, mainly due to relatively excess gastric or duodenal acid secretion. Accordingly it is important to suppress the acid secretion in order to prevent ulcer formation and to cure it.<br>
On the other hand it has been considered that Helicobacter pylori, which is a rod normally existing in stomach, generates ammonia due to its strong urease activity, thereby inducing ulcer. Since, it persistently lives within mucus and mucosa, it becomes the greatest cause for recurrence of ulcer. Accordingly, it has been considered that the recurrence of ulcer can be prevented, if this bacterium is sterilized.<br>

The invention is further described with respect to the following experiments which are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
Experimental protocol: Invivo experiments:<br>
The Applicants have carried out several experiments under different induced ulcer conditions<br>
and the effect of the herbal composition were studied and are tabulated herebelow. The effect of the herbal composition has been compared with respect to a known anti-ulcer drug "Omeprazole".<br>
EXPERIMENT 1: EFFECT ON COLD RESTRAINT ULCERS (CRU) MODEL METHOD: Adult rats of either sex, weighing 150-175 Gms were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. The test drugs were administered 45 minutes before immobilizing the animals. The rats were immobilized in the restraint cage at 4°C in BOD incubator for 2 hrs and were sacrificed immediately after the restraint period. (According to the method of Senay and Levine 1967). The abdomen was cut opened; stomach was taken out and incised along the greater curvature to observe the gastric lesions with the help of Magnascope (5X magnification).<br><br>
The  following  arbitrary  scoring  system  was  used  to  grade  the  severity  and intensity of the lesions.<br>
1.	Shedding of epithelium = 10<br>
2.	Petechial and frank hemorrhages = 20<br>
3.	One or two ulcers^ 30<br>
4.	More than two ulcers = 40<br>
5.	Perforated ulcers = 50<br>
The presence of any of these lesions was considered as a positive ulcerogenic response which has been shown as percentage of rats showing gastric lesions.<br>
The severity of ulcers is expressed in terms of ulcer index, which is the mean score of<br>
gastric lesions of all the rats in a group which is defined as:<br>
Ulcer Index (U.I.) = Us + Up x 10'1<br>
Where Us = Mean severity of ulcer score and Up - Percentage of animals with Ulcer<br>
incidences<br>
The percentage protection is calculated as follows:<br>
Percentage protection = (C-T/C) x 100.<br>
Wherein<br>
C= Number of animals showing ulcer response in control group and<br>
T= Number of animals showing ulcer response in test group.<br>
The effect of the Herbal Composition of the present invention hereafter referred to as "HF2" against Cold Restraint Ulcer Model (CRU) is given in Table 1. The effect of the standard drug "Omeprazole" is also given in Table 1.<br>

EXPERIMENT 3: EFFECT ON ALCOHOL INDUCED GASTRIC ULCERS IN<br>
RATS METHOD:      Adult rats of either sex were taken; weighing 150 -175 grams were fasted for<br>
24 hours with free access to water. The test drugs were administered (p.o.) 45 minutes before albohol administration. 1 ml of chilled absolute alcohol was administered (p.o.) to the rats (According to Wittetal)3. Immediately after 1 hour, the animals were anesthetized, abdomen was cut opened stomach was taken out and incised along the greater curvature to observe the gastric lesions. The ulcers are examined under the 5X magnification with the help of magnascope. Absolute ethanol lesions appears as blackish lesions grouped in patches of varying size, usually parallel to the major axis of the stomach. The lengths of the lesions are measured and summated to give a total lesion score, then calculated and expressed in percentage.<br>
The effect of the herbal composition "HF2" and the standard drug "Omeprazole" against alcohol induced gastric ulcer in rats is given in Table 3.<br>

EXPERIMENT 4: EFFECT ON fflSTAMINE INDUCED ULCER MODEL METHOD: Animals were fasted for 24 hours with access to water. The drug was given orally 1 hour prior to the histamine administration. Histamine was administered in a dose of 0.25 mg/Kg, i.m. at 30 minutes interval -for 7 times and it induced 100 % duodenal ulceration in guinea pig (According to the method of Watt and Eagleton 1964)4. The animals were sacrificed after half an hour of last injection under ether anesthesia. The stomach along with duodenum was removed washed thoroughly and<br>
examined for the lesions and ulcer index with protection index was calculated. The results of the experiment are tabulated in Table 4.<br>
The effect of the herbal composition "HF2" and the standard drug "Omeprazole" against Histamine induced ulcer model is given in Table 4.<br>
EXPERIMENT 5: EFFECT ON PYLORIC LIGATION INDUCED ULCER MODEL METHOD: Animals were fasted for 24 hours in the raised mesh bottom cages to prevent coprophagia and were allowed free access to water. The control group of rats was feed with the vehicle and the experimental groups with their respective drugs 45 minutes prior to the ligation. The animal was anesthetized, abdomen was cut opened under xiphoid process, and the pyloric portion of the stomach was slightly lifted and ligated avoiding any damage to the adjacent blood vessels (According to the method of Shay et al. 1945). The animals were stitched and kept for 4 hours with free access to water. After 4 hours the animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia and the stomach was dissected out incised along the greater curvature. The stomach was washed thoroughly and the ulcer index was scored as per in other ulcer models. The results of the experiment are tabulated in Table 5.<br>
