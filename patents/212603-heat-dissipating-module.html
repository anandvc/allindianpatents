				<td>HEAT-DISSIPATING MODULE<br>
The invention relates to a heat-dissipating module,<br>
more particularly to a heat-dissipating module that can<br>
dissipate heat from a heat-generating electronic<br>
component in a highly efficient manner.<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventional heat-dissipating<br>
device adapted to be mounted on top of a heat-generating<br>
component 12 that is disposed on a circuit board 11 of<br>
an electronic device. The heat-generating component<br>
12 can be a central processing unit, an integrated<br>
circuit, or the like. The heat-dissipating device<br>
includes an aluminum heat-dissipating fin unit 13<br>
disposed in close contact with the heat-generating<br>
component 12, and a fan 14 oriented toward the fin unit<br>
13 . The fin unit 13 has a bottom portion provided with<br>
a heat-conducting plate 15 that is formed from copper<br>
and that facilitates the transfer of heat generated by<br>
the heat-generating component 12 to the fin unit 13.<br>
However, such a conventional heat-dissipating device<br>
has the following setbacks:<br>
1. Although aluminum and copper have quite high<br>
temperature coefficients of conductivity, their<br>
combined heat-dissipating effect is not very<br>
satisfactory, resulting in that the surface<br>
temperature of the heat-generating component 12<br>
remains higher than that of the fin unit 13. That is,<br>
currents of air blown from the fan 14 can only disperse<br>
the heat around the fin unit 13, and cannot reach the<br>
surface of the heat-generating component 12 to<br>
dissipate the heat around the heat-generating<br>
component 12.<br>
2. In view of the aforesaid, when heat gradually<br>
accumulates on the surface of the heat-generating<br>
component 12, and the conventional heat-dissipating<br>
device cannot effectively dissipate the high heat, the<br>
operation of the heat-generating component 12 will be<br>
affected, which may result in shutdown of or even damage<br>
to the electronic device.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a heat-dissipating module that can<br>
dissipate heat generated by a heat-generating<br>
component in a highly efficient manner so as to<br>
eliminate the aforesaid problems associated with the<br>
prior art.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, a<br>
heat-dissipating module includes:<br>
a heat-conducting unit adapted to be disposed on a<br>
heat-generating component of an electronic device, the<br>
heat-conducting unit including a hollow inner tube that<br>
is made of a heat-conducting material and that confines<br>
a first chamber, and a hollow outer tube that is made<br>
of a heat-conducting material, that is disposed<br>
concentrically around the inner tube, and that<br>
cooperates with the inner tube to form a second chamber,<br>
the first chamber permitting passage of air<br>
therethrough, the second chamber having two closed ends<br>
and being filled with a thermal superconductor material,<br>
the outer tube having an outer planar surface adapted<br>
to be disposed in close contact with the heat-<br>
generating component! so that heat generated by the<br>
heat-generating component is transferred to the<br>
heat-conducting unit; and<br>
a fan unit disposed to generate a current of air<br>
through the first chamber so as to carry away the heat<br>
transferred to the heat-conducting unit.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a<br>
heat-dissipating module includes:<br>
a heat-conducting unit adapted to be disposed on a<br>
heat-generating component of an electronic device, the<br>
heat-conducting unit including a hollow tubular member<br>
having inner and outer walls opposite to each other,<br>
the inner and outer walls confining an enclosed chamber<br>
that is filled with a thermal superconductor material;<br>
and<br>
a heat-dissipating unit disposed on the tubular<br>
member and including at least one of a metal plate, a<br>
heat-conducting pipe and a plurality of heat-<br>
dissipating fins.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent in the following<br>

according to the invention.<br>
Before the present invention is described in greater<br>
detail, it should be noted that like elements are<br>
denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the<br>
disclosure.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the first preferred<br>
embodiment of a heat dissipating module according to<br>
the present invention is shown to include a heat-<br>
conducting unit 5. The heat-conducting unit 5 is<br>
adapted to be disposed on a heat-generating component<br>
3 of an electronic device, such as a central processing<br>
unit or an integrated circuit of a computer. In this<br>
embodiment, the heat-generating component 3 is a<br>
central processing unit mounted on a circuit board 11.<br>
The heat-conducting unit 5 is formed by extrusion from<br>
a metal material, such as aluminum, copper, or alloys<br>
thereof, or a material with good heat conductivity, and<br>
includes a hollow inner tube 51 that is made of a<br>
heat-conducting material and that confines a first<br>
chamber 510, and a hollow outer tube 52 that is made<br>
of a heat-conducting material, that is disposed<br>
concentrically around the inner tube 51, and that<br>
cooperates with the inner tube 51 to form a second<br>
chamber 520. The outer tube 52 further has an outer<br>
planar surface 53 adapted to be disposed in close<br>
contact with the heat-generating component 3 so that<br>
heat generated by the heat-generating component 3 is<br>
transferred to the heat-conducting unit 5. The first<br>
chamber 510 has two open ends 53, 54, and permits passage<br>
of air therethrough. The second chamber 520 has two<br>
closed ends, and is filled with a thermal<br>
superconductor material 10 that can adhere to the inner<br>
and outer tubes 51, 52 in the vacuum interior of the<br>
second chamber 520, so that heat transferred from the<br>
heat-generating component 3 can quickly distribute all<br>
over the surfaces of the inner and outer tubes 51, 52<br>
to bring the surface temperature of the heat-generating<br>
component 3 in accord with that of the heat-conducting<br>
unit 5. The thermal superconductor material 10 is<br>
preferably formed from inorganic elements to inhibit<br>
generation of oxygen and hydrogen molecules to thereby<br>
avoid danger of explosion, and is a non-radioactive<br>
material. In addition, the thermal superconductor<br>
material 10 has an applicable temperature range from<br>
about -50°C to 1700°C.<br>
A fan unit 6 is disposed to generate currents of air<br>
through the first chamber 510 so as to carry away the<br>
heat transferred to the heat-conducting unit 5 from the<br>
heat-generating component 3. The fan unit 6 can be<br>
disposed within the first chamber 510 and/or externally<br>
of the heat-conducting unit 5. In the embodiment shown<br>
in Figure 2, the fan unit 6 includes a fan mounted within<br>
the inner tube 51, and two fans disposed proximate to<br>
the open ends 53, 54, respectively, to dissipate the<br>
heat upstream and downstream of the heat-conducting<br>
unit 5.<br>
Furthermore, a heat-dissipating member 7 is<br>
disposed on the outer tube 52 of the heat-conducting<br>
unit 5. The heat-dissipating member 7 can be a metal<br>
plate forming a part of a housing panel of the computer<br>
(not shown) or a known heat-conducting pipe, which is<br>
disposed on one side of the outer tube 52 so as to provide<br>
an enhanced heat-dissipating effect.<br>
In addition, a thermoelectric cooling unit 4 can be<br>
mounted on the outer tube 52 of the heat-conducting unit<br>
5 and is adapted to be connected to a metal housing 9<br>
of the computer so as to help lower the temperature of<br>
the heat-conducting unit 5.<br>
In use, since the heat-conducting unit 5 having the<br>
thermal superconductor material 10 disposed therein<br>
has a very high temperature coefficient of conductivity,<br>
the heat generated by the heat-generating component 3<br>
can be quickly transferred to the heat-conducting unit<br>
5 for dissipation with the aid of the fan unit 6, the<br>
heat-dissipating member 7, and the thermoelectric<br>
cooling unit 4.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the second preferred<br>
embodiment of a heat-dissipating module according to<br>
the invention. This embodiment is substantially the<br>
same as the previous embodiment, the main difference<br>
therebetween residing in that the heat-conducting unit<br>
5' has a substantially L-shaped configuration.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the third preferred embodiment<br>
of a heat-dissipating module according to the invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a plurality of heat-dissipating<br>
fins 8 are disposed vertically within an inner tube 51A<br>
of a heat-conducting unit 5A that is adapted to be<br>
disposed in close contact with the heat-generating<br>
component 3 mounted on the circuit board 11. Each of<br>
the fins 8 has opposing ends that are connected to<br>
opposite inner wall surfaces of the inner tube 51A so<br>
as to enhance the heat-dissipating effect. In addition,<br>
heat-dissipating fins 8' are also provided to extend<br>
uprightly from an outer wall surface of an outer tube<br>
52A of the heat-conducting unit 5A so as to obtain an<br>
increased heat-dissipating area.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment of a heat-dissipating module according to<br>
the invention. In this embodiment, a heat-conducting<br>
unit 5B is configured as a generally U-shaped hollow<br>
tubular member that has inner and outer walls 51B, 52B<br>
opposite to each other, and that includes a horizontal<br>
portion adapted to be disposed in close contact with<br>
the heat-generating component 3 mounted on the circuit<br>
board 11, and two upright portions opposite to each<br>
other. The inner and outer walls 51B, 52B confine an<br>
enclosed chamber filled with. the thermal<br>
superconductor material 10. A plurality of heat-<br>
dissipating fins 8B extend transversely between the<br>
upright portions such that each of the fins 8B has<br>
opposing ends connected to the inner wall 51B of the<br>
heat-conducting unit 5B.<br>
Figure 7 shows the fifth preferred embodiment of a<br>
heat-dissipating module according to the invention.<br>
This embodiment is substantially similar to the fourth<br>
preferred embodiment. The major differences between<br>
this embodiment and the fourth preferred embodiment<br>
reside in that a heat-conducting unit 5C is a generally<br>
L-shaped tubular member that includes a horizontal<br>
portion and a vertical portion, and that a plurality<br>
of L-shaped heat-dissipating fins 8C are provided to<br>
extend from the horizontal portion to the vertical<br>
portion such that each of the fins 8C has distal ends<br>
connected to an inner wall 51C of the heat-conducting<br>
unit 5C. In addition, a heat-dissipating member 7C is<br>
disposed on an outer wall 52C of the heat-conducting<br>
unit 5C.<br>
Figure 8 shows the sixth preferred embodiment of a<br>
heat-dissipating module according to the invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a heat-conducting unit 5D has a<br>
planar outer wall 52D adapted to be disposed in close<br>
contact with the heat-generating component 3 mounted<br>
on the circuit board 11, and a planar inner wall 51D<br>
opposite to the outer wall 52D. A heat-dissipating fin<br>
unit 8D extends uprightly from the inner wall 51D, and<br>
terminates at an aluminum connecting surface 80, which<br>
is provided to increase the heat-dissipating area. In<br>
addition, a heat-dissipating member 7D is disposed to<br>
extend uprightly from the heat-conducting unit 5D to<br>
the aluminum connecting surface 80 so as to further<br>
enhance the heat-dissipating effect.<br>
