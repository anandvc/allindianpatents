				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to sulfur dye protection systems and compositions and methods employing same, as well as processes for making sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, processes for dyeing textiles with sulfur dyes and textiles dyed by such processes. More particularly, the present invention relates to modifying existing dyes and/or making newly formed sulfur dyes. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to materials that can interact (i.e., chemically or physically) with sulfur dyes to protect the sulfur dyes from oxidation by oxidizing agents, such as bleaching agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Dyeing of textiles for use in garments, rugs, tapestries and the dyeing of other fibrous materials such as hair and the like has been in existence for ages. One of the most popular classes of dyes for such use has been sulfur dyes. Sulfur dyes have been and are relatively inexpensive as compared to other classes of dyes. However, in the recent years, the cost advantages of sulfur dyes has diminished such that there is no longer a large competitive edge for using sulfur dyes as compared to other classes of dyes. As a result of this diminishing of the cost advantages of sulfur dyes, the disadvantages of sulfur dyes has become more of a factor in the selection of dyes for such uses.<br>
One of the most noticeable disadvantages associated with sulfur dyes, especially black and brown sulfur dyes, is the susceptibility of sulfur dyes to become over-oxidized by bleaching agents, such as chlorine bleaches, oxygen bleaching agents, activated oxygen bleaches and UV radiation, such as from the sun, and the like. When a sulfur dyed textile is exposed to bleaching agents, the sulfur dye has a propensity to react with the bleaching agents to be over-oxidized. As a result of the over-oxidizing of the sulfur dye, the sulfur dyed textile and/or other fibrous material begins to exhibit dye damage leading to color change.<br>
Another problem associated with conventional sulfur dyes and textiles dyed by the conventional sulfur dyes is the problem of aging or tendering. Aging of the textiles results in large part from the fiber damage caused by sulfuric acid produced during storage and transportation of the conventional sulfur dyed textiles.<br>
Yet another problem associated with conventional sulfur dyes and textiles dyes by the conventional sulfur dyes is the problem of the poor wash fastness.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to develop sulfur dye protection systems that protect sulfur dyes, especially sulfur dyes on textiles and/or other fibrous materials, from oxidation by oxidizing agents, such as bleaching agents, from tendering/aging and from reducing-color fastness environments, such as laundry wash liquor, especially bleach-containing laundry wash liquor, compositions comprising such systems, and methods for using such systems, and a need to increase the bleach stability of sulfur dyes, such as by modifying existing sulfur dyes and/or "building-into" newly formed sulfur dyes increased bleach stability properties; to dye textiles with such sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, and/or make bleach stable sulfur dyed textiles.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention fulfills the needs identified above by providing sulfur dye protection systems that protect sulfur dyes, especially sulfur dyes on textiles and/or other fibrous materials, from oxidation by oxidizing agents, such as bleaching agents, compositions comprising such systems, and methods for using such systems; processes for making sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, processes for using such sulfur dyes to dye textiles and textiles dyed by such sulfur dyes. More particularly, the present invention provides a process for modifying existing dyes and/or making newly formed sulfur dyes such that the sulfur dyes exhibit increased bleach stability as compared to unmodified sulfur dyes and/or sulfur dyes that are not initially formed with the increased bleach stability properties "built-into" the sulfur dye at the time of forming the sulfur dye.<br>

These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages will be clear from the following detailed description, examples and appended claims.<br>
All percentages and proportions herein are by weight, and all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference, unless otherwise specifically indicated.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention DEFINITIONS<br>
"System" - "System" as used herein means a complex unity formed of many often, but not always, diverse parts (i.e., materials, compositions, devices, appliances, procedures, methods, conditions, etc.) subject to a common plan or serving a common purpose.<br>
"Effective Amount" - "Effective Amount" as used herein means is any amount capable of measurably inhibiting sulfur dye color change of a sulfur dyed substrate.<br>
"Sulfur Dyed Substrates" - "Sulfur Dyed Substrates" as used herein means any textiles, fabrics, yarns and/or fibers, preferably cellulosic textiles, fabric, yams and/or fibers.<br>
Sulfur dyes are and have been used extensively on cellulosic textiles, fabrics, yarns and/or fibers, preferably such as cotton, rayon, ramie, jute, flax, linen, polynosic-fibers, Lyocell, poly/cotton, other cotton blends and mixtures thereof, more preferably cotton, polycotton, rayon and cotton blends.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of products incorporating such sulfur dyed textiles, fabrics, yams and/or fibers include garments, upholstery, drapery and carpets. SULFUR DYE PROTECTION SYSTEMS<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sulfur dye protection system comprising a material that interacts (i.e., chemically or physically), preferably chemically, with the sulfur dye, preferably the disulfide bond of the sulfur dye, such that inhibition of the sulfur dye or parts thereof from color change caused by oxidation, such as by bleaching, is provided.<br>
Further, it has been surprisingly found that the sulfur dyes and protection systems of the present invention provide improved aging benefits, especially on black dyes, as well as colorfastness of dyes on textiles, as compared to conventional sulfur dyes.<br>
The materials that interact with the sulfur dye include, but are not limited to, sources of one or more metal ions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the one or more metal ions complexes with the sulfur-containing moiety, preferably the disulfide bond, of the sulfur dye. Further, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that by forming the metal complex, the electron density on the sulfur atoms within the sulfur dye is reduced<br>
significantly because the disulfide bonds behave like electron donors in the complex. Further, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the metal complex sterically hinders the accessibility of oxidizing agents, such as bleaching agents, more preferably activated oxygen bleaches and/or oxygen bleaches, to the disulfide bonds of the sulfur dyes.<br>
The one or more metal ions preferably comprise an electron configuration such that the one or more metal ions is at its most stable oxidation state. In other words, the metal ions cannot be oxidized by bleaching agents.<br>
The one or more metal ions preferably comprise lanthanide metal ions, more preferably lanthanide metal ions selected from the group consisting of: La(III), Ce(IV), Gd(III) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the one or more metal ions may comprise a transition metal ion, preferably a transition metal ion selected from the group consisting of: Ni(II), Co(II), Pd(II), Pt(II), Sn(IV), Pb(II), Hg(II) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of sources of the one or more metal ions are lanthanide metal salts, such as lanthanum (III) sulfate, cerium (IV) sulfate and gadolinium (III) sulfate, chloride, and transition metal salts. SULFUR DYE PROTECTION SYSTEM-CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a composition, preferably a fabric care composition, comprising a sulfur dye protection system of the present invention is provided. Forms of Compositions<br>
The present invention relates to pre-soak, pre-treat, through-the-wash, through-the-rinse, textile mill finishing compositions, textile mill dyeing compositions and post-treat compositions. The compositions of the present invention may be used in finishing and/or dyeing processes especially for textiles, textile and/or garment treating processes, such as laundering, and/or pre-treat and post-treat processes where a finished textile and/or garment is treated to impart a benefit. The compositions of the present invention provide increased color fidelity benefits, such as reduced color fading, reduced dye transfer, color protection even in the presence of oxygen bleaching agents, reduced crocking, and/or reduced sun fading, to sulfur dyed substrates.<br>
The compositions may take any form, for example, solid (powder, granules, bars, tablets), dimple tablets, liquids, paste, gel, spray, stick, foam, thixotropic liquids, preferably the compositions take the form of liquids.<br>
The liquid forms can also be in a "concentrated" form which are diluted to form compositions with the usage concentrations, as given hereinbelow, for use in the "usage conditions". Concentrated compositions (i.e., compositions where the water content is less than<br>
40%, more preferably less than 30%, most preferably less than 20% by weight of the compositions) comprise a higher level of sulfur dye protection systems, typically from about 1% to about 99%, preferably from about 2% to about 65%, more preferably from about 3% to about 25%, by weight of the concentrated fabric care composition. Concentrated compositions are used in order to provide a less expensive product. When a concentrated product is used, i.e., when the sulfur dye protection system is from about 1% to about 99%, by weight of the concentrated composition, it is preferable to dilute the composition, preferably with water, before treating a sulfur dyed substrate in need of treatment with such a concentrated composition.<br>
The present invention also relates to compositions of the present invention incorporated into a spray dispenser to create an article of manufacture that can facilitate treatment of sulfur dyed substrates with said compositions at a level that is effective, yet is not discernible when dried on the surfaces. The spray dispenser comprises manually activated and non-manual powered (operated) spray means and a container containing the composition. The articles of manufacture preferably are in association with instructions for use to ensure that the consumer applies sufficient composition to provide the desired benefit.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be incoiporated into a spray dispenser, or concentrated stick form that can create an article of manufacture that can facilitate the cleaning and/or fabric care or conditioning of fabric.<br>
The spray-treatment compositions herein are typically packaged in spray dispensers. The spray dispensers can be any of the manually activated means for producing a spray of liquid droplets as is known in the art, e.g. trigger-type, pump-type, non-aerosol self-pressurized, and aerosol-type spray means. It is preferred that at least about 70%, more preferably, at least about 80%, most preferably at least about 90% of the droplets have a particle size of smaller than about 200 microns.<br>
The spray dispenser can be an aerosol dispenser. Said aerosol dispenser comprises a container which can be constructed of any of the conventional materials employed in fabricating aerosol containers. The dispenser must be capable of withstanding internal pressure in the range of from about 20 to about 110 p.s.i.g., more preferably from about 20 to about 70 p.s.i.g. The one important requirement concerning the dispenser is that it be provided with a valve member which will permit the fabric care compositions of the present invention contained in the dispenser to be dispensed in the form of a spray of very fine, or finely divided, particles or droplets. A more complete description of commercially available suitable aerosol spray dispensers appears in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,436,772, Stebbins, issued Apr.8, 1969; and 3,600,325, Kaufman et al., issued Aug. 17,1971.<br>
Preferably the spray dispenser is a self-pressurized non-aerosol container having a convoluted liner and an elastomeric sleeve. A more complete description of suitable self-pressurized spray dispensers can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,111,971, Winer, issued May 12, 1992; and 5,232,126, Winer, issued Aug. 3, 1993. Another type of suitable aerosol spray dispenser is one wherein a barrier separates the wrinkle reducing composition from the propellant (preferably compressed air or nitrogen), as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,260,110, issued Apr. 7, 1981, incorporated herein by reference. Such a dispenser is available from EP Spray Systems, East Hanover, N. J.<br>
More preferably, the spray dispenser is a non-aerosol, manually activated, pump-spray dispenser. A more complete disclosure of commercially available suitable dispensing devices appears in: U.S. Pat. Nos.: 4,895,279, Schultz, issued Jan. 23, 1990; 4,735,347, Schultz et al., issued Apr. 5, 1988; and 4,274,560, Carter, issued Jun. 23, 1981.<br>
Most preferably, the spray dispenser is a manually activated trigger-spray dispenser. A more complete disclosure of commercially available suitable dispensing devices appears in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 4,082,223, Nozawa, issued Apr. 4, 1978; 4,161,288, McKinney, issued Jul. 7, 1985; 4,434,917, Saito et al., issued Mar. 6, 1984; and 4,819,835, Tasaki, issued Apr. 11, 1989; 5,303,867, Peterson, issued Apr. 19,1994.<br>
A broad array of trigger sprayers or finger pump sprayers are suitable for use with the compositions of this invention. These are readily available from suppliers such as Calmar, Inc., City of Industry, California; CSI (Continental Sprayers, Inc.), St. Peters, Missouri; Berry Plastics Corp., Evansville, Indiana - a distributor of Guala ® sprayers; or Seaquest Dispensing, Gary, 111.<br>
The preferred trigger sprayers are the blue inserted Guala ® sprayer, available from Berry Plastics Corp., the Calmar TS800-1A® sprayers, available from Calmar Inc., or the CSI T7500® available from Continental Sprayers Inc., because of the fine uniform spray characteristics, spray volume and pattern size. Any suitable bottle or container can be used with the trigger sprayer, the preferred bottle is a 17 fl-oz. bottle (about 500 ml) of good ergonomics similar in shape to the Cinch® bottle. It can be made of any materials such as high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, glass or any other material that forms bottles. Preferably, it is made of high density polyethylene or polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
For smaller four fl-oz size (about 118 ml), a finger pump can be used with canister or cylindrical bottle. The preferred pump for this application is the cylindrical Euromist II® from Seaquest Dispensing.<br>
It has been found that sulfur dye protection systems of the present invention impart to the fabric improved color appearance and/or color fastness. Tvoes of Fabric Care Compositions<br><br>
a. Finishing and/or Dyeing Compositions<br>
Compositions of the present invention can be used in dyeing processes and/or other finishing processes that typically occur in a textile mill. Such industrial compositions typically comprise a level of sulfur dye protection system, preferably one or more metal ions in accordance with the present invention, of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 30%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 20%, by weight of the dyeing compositions and optionally, but preferably, one or more adjunct ingredients.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art know that textile mills conventionally use two types of methods to apply sulfur dyes to textiles, fabrics and/or fibers.<br>
One method is the exhaust method or batch method. In the exhaust dyeing method, the soluble sulfur dye is applied via a dye bath which typically contains the sulfur dyes, which may be in their water-insoluble form or in their pre-reduced (leuco) form (water-soluble form), a reducing agent (even if the sulfur dyes are in their pre-reduced form to ensure a reducing environment in the dye bath), such as sodium sulfide and other suitable ingredients. To this dyebath is added the textile, fabric, yarn and/or fibers to be dyed. After dyeing but before oxidizing the water-soluble form of the sulfur dye to its water-insoluble form, the dyed textiles, fabrics, yarns and/or fibers are rinsed well with warm and hot water. Finally, an oxidizing agent, such as sodium bromate is added to an aqueous solution containing the dyed textiles, fabrics, yarns and/or fibers to oxidize the water-soluble form of the sulfur dye to the water-insoluble form. Then the sulfur dyed textiles/fabrics, yarns and/or fibers are rinsed and/or soaped and/or dried. The exhaust method is more fully described in the following literature references: Tobin H, American Dyestuff Reporte, 68, p. 26,1979; Leon Tigler, Textile Chemist &amp; Colourists, Vol. 12, No. 6, p. 43, 1980; and Sulfur Dyes, Martin Marietta Chemicals, Sodyeco Division, 2/80-LT.<br>
The other method is the continuous method. In the continuous method, the sulfur dyes are applied to textiles, fabrics, yams and/or fibers continously by the pad/steam method which consists of the following steps: pad; steam; rinse; oxidize; and rinse. The pad step comprises a padding bath which contains the sulfur dye, which may be in their water-insoluble form or in their pre-reduced (leuco) form (water-soluble form), a reducing agent (even if the sulfur dyes are in their pre-reduced form to ensure a reducing environment in the dye bath), such as sodium sulfide and other suitable ingredients. The steam step comprises passing the sulfur dyed textiles, fabrics, yarns and/or fibers through a steamer filled with steam to obtain an oxygen-free atmosphere. Next the sulfur dyed substrate is rinsed with warm and hot water. Then the sulfur dyed substrate is oxidized by an oxidizing agent, such as sodium bromate. Finally, the sulfur dyed substrate is rinsed again. The continuous method is more fully described in the following literature references: Leon Tigler, Textile Chemist &amp; Colourists, Vol. 12, No. 6, p. 43, 1980; and Sulfur Dyes, Martin Marietta Chemicals, Sodyeco Division, 2/80-LT; and Tom Burns, Efficient Pad Steam of Sulfur Colors, Sandoz Chem. Corp., December 1, 1987.<br>
The finishing and/or dyeing compositions of the present invention are typically applied to the dyed substrate before, along with or after applying the oxidizing agent, b. Laundering Compositions<br>

Typical rinse-added compositions, including liquid fabric conditioning compositions and/or other rinse additive compositions, contain a level of sulfur dye protection system preferably one or more metal ions in accordance with the present invention, of from about 0.1% to about 80%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 50%, more preferably from about 1% to about 30%, by weight of the rinse-added compositions and optionally, but preferably one or more adjunct ingredients.<br>
Preferably the in-use levels of the sulfur dye protection system, preferably one or more metal ions in accordance with the present invention, present in an aqueous rinse solution comprising the wash-added compositions of the present invention are from about 0.5 ppm to about 400 ppm, more preferably from about 2.5 ppm to about 250 ppm, most preferably from about 5 ppm to about 150 ppm.<br>
Preferably the articles of manufacture in accordance with the present invention are in association with instructions for how to use the composition to treat sulfur dyed substrates, especially textiles and/or garments and/or fabrics correctly, to obtain the desirable results, for example, improved color appearance including, e.g., the manner and/or amount of composition to be used. It is important that the instructions be as simple and clear as possible. Accordingly, the use of pictures and/or icons to assist in explaining the instructions is desirable.<br>

The sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, of the present invention can be measured for bleach stability according to the following procedure, which is described is a proposed AATCC Method titled "Colorfastness to Home Laundering with Activated Oxygen Bleach Detergent: Accelerated". Accordingly, the determination of whether a sulfur dye, either a modified sulfur dye, or a sulfur dye with a "built-in" bleach stability feature, falls within the scope of the present invention is achieved by following the Protocol set forth below. Protocol Step 1 - Equipment Preparation<br>
Adjust a laundering machine, a LAUNDEROMETER® commercially available from Atlas Electric Devices Co., 4114 N. Ravenswood Ave., Chicago, IL 60613 to maintain 20 +/-2 °C. The laundering machine is capable of rotating closed canisters in a thermostactically controlled (+1-2 °C of prescribed temperature) water bath at 40 +1-2 rpm. The canisters are stainless steel lever lock canisters 550 +/-50 ml, 75 x 125 mm. For heavy weight fabrics, stainless steel lever lock canisters 1200 ml, 90 x 200 mm may be used. Step 2 - Preparation of Detergent Solution<br>
A minimum of IL detergent solution should be prepared and freshly made 30 minutes prior to testing for each laundering run. Prepare the wash liquor by dissolving lOg of the 1993 AATCC Standard Reference Detergent WOB (without fluorescent whitening agents and without phosphate) powder, available from AATCC, P.O. Box 12215, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, plus 4g bleach activator (NOBS) and 3g sodium perborate monohydrate (FBI) per liter of distilled or deionized water of not more than 15 ppm hardness. Preheat this solution to 20 +1-2 °C. Step 3 - Mixing of Detergent Solution<br>
Disperse vigorously the detergent solution from Step 2 using the mixer in distilled or deionized water of not more than 15 ppm hardness at 20 +1-2 °C and stir for 10 +/-1 minutes. Step 4 - Prepare Fabric Specimens<br>
The size of the fabric specimens is as follows: 50 mm x 100 mm pieces of textiles. Yarn may be knit on an appropriate sample knitting machine. Keep one knitted specimen for each sample as an unwashed original.<br>
Determine the mass, in g, of each specimen using a balance accurate to +/-0.01g. Three replicates are advised for improved precision. Replicates should be tested in separate cycles.<br>
The fabric specimens are dyed with sulfur dyes. The control fabric specimens are dyed with a conventional, unmodified sulfur dye, such as a commercially available sulfur dye. The test fabric specimens are dyed with the unmodified sulfur dye as modified or formed with the "built-in" bleach stability component in accordance with the present invention. Steps 5-9 are conducted for both the control fabric specimens and the test fabric specimens. Step 5 - Filling Canisters<br>
Add to each laundering device canister the appropriate volume of wash liquor from Step 3 to provide a wash liquonspecimen ratio of 100 ml of wash<br>
liquor: 1g of fabric. (Note: Test one specimen per laundering device canister). Step 6 - Preheating Canisters<br>
The filled canisters from Step 5 are preheated to the test temperature by one or two ways: 1) by use of the laundering machine or 2) by use of a preheater/storage unit.<br>
If canisters are to be preheated by use of a preheater/storage unit, place the canisters in a preheater module at 20 +1-2 °C for at least 2 min.<br>
If canisters are to be preheated in the laundering machine go to Step 8. Step 7 - Add Specimen to Canisters<br>
After preheating canisters to 20 +1-2 °C, add a control or test fabric specimen from Step 4 into each canister. Then clamp the covers on the canisters. A TEFLON® fluorocarbon gasket commercially available from DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE 19898 may be inserted between the neoprene gasket and the top of each canister to prevent contamination of the wash solution by the neoprene. Step 8 - Placing Canisters in Laundering Machine<br>
Fasten the canisters in the adapters on the rotor of the laundering machine. Place an equal number of canisters on each side of the shaft.<br>
For canisters preheated in the laundering machine, start the rotor and run it for at least 2 min. to preheat the canisters. Stop the rotor and with a row of canisters in an upright position, unclamp the cover of one canister, enter a test specimen into the solution and replace the cover, but do not clamp it. Repeat this operation until all the canisters in the row have been loaded. Then clamp the covers in the same order in which the canisters were loaded (delay clamping the covers to allow equalization of pressure). Repeat this operation until all rows of canisters have been loaded.<br>
Check that the solution in the canisters is at the initial temperature (20 +/-2 °C. Close the canisters and commence rotation.<br>
Increase the temperature at a maximum of 2 °C/minute to 60 °C and continue to run for a further 30 minutes at 60 °C.<br>
Stop the machine, remove the canisters and empty the contents into 4L beakers half filled with distilled or deionized water of not more than 15 ppm hardness, keeping each test specimen in a separate beaker.  Gently agitate and rinse for 1 minute and then place the beaker under a cold running tap for 10 minutes.<br>
Squeeze the fabric specimen by hand to remove the excess water.<br>
Dry the fabric specimen by pressing flat between filter papers to remove<br>
excess water. Then hang it in air at a temperature not exceeding 60 °C. Step 9 - Preparing Fabric Specimens for Evaluation<br>
Prepare fabric specimens for evaluation by trimming off raveled yarns and lightly brushing off any loose fiber and yam on the fabric surfaces.     Woven fabrics<br>
may be stitched around edges to prevent raveling. Brush pile fabric specimens in required direction to restore them as nearly as possible to the same pile angle as the untreated specimens. Specimens should be smoothed or flattened if they are wrinkled     due to washing and/or drying. Specimens may be mounted on cards to facilitate identification and handling in their evaluation. For consistency in backing material, use a white mounting card with tristimulus value of at least 85%. Mounting material must not be visible in the area to be viewed and must not interfere with instrumental assessment of color according to AATCC Evaluation Procedure 7, Instrumental Assessment of the Change in Color of a Test Specimen. Step 10 - Evaluation of Color Change<br>
The color change can be quantitatively determined by measuring the color difference between the control fabric specimen and the test fabric specimen using a suitable colorimeter or spectrophotometer with the appropriate software (see AATCC Evaluation Procedure 7, Instrumental Assessment of the Change in Color of a Test Specimen). Determine the color change for the control fabric specimen (AEC) and the color change for the test fabric specimen (AEt). Then calculate the percent reduction of color change caused by bleaching (RCC) as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Bleach stable modified sulfur dyes and/or sulfur dyes having bleach stability properties "built-in" in accordance with the present invention, preferably exhibit an RCC greater than 20%, more preferably greater than 30%, most preferably greater than 40%. PROCESSES FOR DYEING TEXTILES<br>
The sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, of the present invention are suitable for dyeing textiles, especially textiles that potentially or will contact bleaching agents during the effective life of the textile, such as garments and the like.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a process for dyeing a textile comprising contacting the textile with a bleach stable sulfur dye made by a process in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The dyeing of the textile during this process comprises the conventional, well known steps of sulfur dyeing of textiles; namely, 1) reducing a water-insoluble sulfur dye with a reducing agent, such as sodium sulfide, glucose, or other known reducing agents such that the sulfur dye becomes water-soluble sulfur dye solution, 2) contacting the textile to be dyed with the water-soluble sulfur dye solution, and 3) oxidizing the water-soluble sulfur dye solution with an oxidizing agent, such as sodium bromate, potassium iodate and the like, such that the water-insoluble sulfur dye is formed on and/or in the textile. Under conventional sulfur dyeing of textiles, care should be taken to not over-oxidize the water-insoluble sulfur dye. However, in light of the fact that the sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, of the present invention are being used to dye the textiles in this process, the risks associated with over-oxidizing are significantly reduced or non-existent.<br>
Preferably the textiles to be dyed comprise cotton, rayon, cotton/nylon blend, cotton/polyester blend and mixtures thereof. SULFUR DYED TEXTILES<br>
The processes for dyeing textiles with the sulfur dyes, especially bleach stable sulfur dyes, of the present invention result in sulfur dyed textile articles, especially bleach stable sulfur dyed textile articles. These sulfur dyed textile articles are especially useful for incorporation into garments because such garments would resist the loss of the sulfur dyes during laundering of the garments by consumers, especially when the laundering operation includes exposing the garments to bleaching agents, especially oxygen bleaching agents.<br>
