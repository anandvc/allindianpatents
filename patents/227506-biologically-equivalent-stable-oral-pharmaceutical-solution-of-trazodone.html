COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rulel3)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Biologically equivalent, stable oral pharmaceutical solution of Trazodone"<br>
2. APPLICANT<br>
(a) NAME: URSAM PHARMA<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian<br>
Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: St. Jude Apartment, Guirim, Bardez, Mapusa,<br>
Goa - 403507, India.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to liquid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising serotonin reuptake inhibitor or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in association with pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier for the treatment of depression or other central nervous system diseases. More particularly the present invention relates to a biologically equivalent and physicochemically stable oral pharmaceutical solution composition comprising trazodone or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Trazodone was first disclosed in US patent 3381009, is a special type of antidepressant used to treat depression or sleeplessness and also used to treat other conditions. Trazodone regulates the mood by increasing the available amount of certain brain chemicals. Trazodone is a generic name given to 2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl]propyl]-l,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine-3(2H)-one, which is having the following structure.<br><br><br><br>
In recent years, Trazodone has been increasingly used as an antidepressant in elderly population. It is also used as an agent to calm agitated patients - particularly in the long term nursing facilities due to its sedative and anti-anxiety properties. Moreover, its use at bedtime to treat mild insomnia is especially convenient since the usage does not need to be monitored as other benzodiazepine related drugs which are controlled and have abuse potentials.<br>
Reported prior arts describe various trazodone formulations in association with serotonin precursor or in association with B6 or in association with folate source used<br>
2<br><br>
for the treatment of depression disclosed as in EP1266659, US6191133, and US5739136 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Trazodone HC1 is also useful in elderly depressed patients, in whom daily dosage requirements are normally reduced because of pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging (i.e., reductions in both hepatic clearance and protein binding). In these patients, antidepressant therapy is usually initiated at a low dosage and increased over a 7- to 10-day period to achieve the initial target dosage and may have to be increased further in some patients in order to achieve the best results. A patient friendly suitable dosage form, such as liquid which can be very easily and continuously titrated up or downwards with increments of fractions of milliliters is thus a significant benefit over solid dosage forms which can not be used in fine dose titrations.<br>
Slow tapering of the antidepressant medication is often practiced after few years of treatment if the patient is completely asymptomatic and is not experiencing or anticipating significant stressors. Again, liquid dosage form which can be very easily and continuously tapered downwards by using fractions of milliliters is thus a significant benefit over the solid dosage forms.<br>
For very old and smaller patients, when the prescribed dosage of Trazodone are much smaller, such as 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg, the pharmacist has to cut the tablet in half, or quarter, and in some cases even to one eighth since such small dose tablets or capsules are commonly not available. It is not only inconvenient to divide these many a times un-scored dosage forms but it also results in erroneous dose delivery due to imprecision in cutting. The oral solution formulation of Trazodone is thus ideal since fraction of a dose can be very easily measured as a solution using an oral syringe or calibrated spoon. The oral liquid is also desirable in the case of severely ill or incapacitated patients needing medications administered through gastric or nasal tubes. In these patients, nurses always prefer liquid products as it also eliminates the need for crushing the solid dosages to administer through the tubes.<br>
It is clear from the above discussion, that a pharmaceutically stable and biologically equivalent solution of Trazodone HC1 for oral administration is required for a large section of patient population.    However, no such stable  liquid  formulation of<br>
3<br><br>
Trazodone for oral administration is available for convenient deliveries to convalescent, geriatric, and pediatric populations. Hence, the present invention of liquid dosage form for oral administration is aimed to fulfill this unmet need. The present invention offers technical advancement and also has economic significance for elderly, invalid and infant patient community.<br>
Objective of the invention:<br>
The main objective of the present invention is aimed to provide liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising Trazodone HC1 for oral administration for geriatric, and pediatric patients.<br>
The other objective of the present invention is to provide novel liquid formulation for oral administration which is aesthetically desirable, pharmaceutical^ elegant, physico-chemically stable over extended period of time and pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to the currently marketed tablet formulation.<br>
Further objective is to provide palatable formulation for patient compliance.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention discloses liquid pharmaceutical solution for oral administration to a subject in need thereof which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of Trazodone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier. In the present invention, the formulation is provided such that it is palatable, its optimum solubility is maintained for extended period of time, long term chemical stability is ensured, and it is pharmacokinetically equivalent to the other solid oral dosage forms using excipients such as co-solvents, one or more taste-enhancing/masking agents, preservatives, and a buffering agent. The invention also provides process for preparation thereof..<br>
