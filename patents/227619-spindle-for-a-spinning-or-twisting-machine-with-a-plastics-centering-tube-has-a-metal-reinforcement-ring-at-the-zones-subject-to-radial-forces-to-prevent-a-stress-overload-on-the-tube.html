				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a spindle for spinning or<br>
twisting machines) said spindle having a rotating spindle shaft,<br>
which is supported in a spindle bearing housing by means of a<br>
neck bearing and a step bearing, which comprises a step bearing<br>
sleeve, which is arranged in a centering tube made of flexible<br>
plastic and being radially movable in the area of the step<br>
bearing, said centering tube being secured in the area of the<br>
neck bearing in the spindle bearing housing and being supported<br>
in the area of the step bearing by means of damping spiral on the<br>
spindle bearing housing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A spindle of this type is prior art in German published Patent<br>
19 60 224. The centering tube of this spindle is made of a<br>
flexible plastic, so that the inert vibrational properties<br>
inherent in this material can be taken advantage of in order to<br>
achieve a particularly smooth running of the spindle shaft. A<br>
plastic centering tube of this type has damping properties which<br>
take up the vibrations particularly quickly, which damping<br>
properties combine with the damping forces of the damping spiral,<br>
so that a particularly smooth running of the spindle is achieved.<br><br>
FR 2831896 discloses a centering and retaining assembly which<br>
consists of two sleeves (3,4), made wholly or partly from<br>
plastic, that fit together, one carried on a rotating shaft and<br>
the other receiving a tubular support. The sleeve (4) receiving<br>
the support has expanding peripheral fingers (4a) with inner<br>
ramps (4b) able to co-operate with a matching surface (3b) on the<br>
other sleeve (3). At least one of the sleeves is able to move<br>
lengthwise, while a spring (7) between the two sleeves urges them<br>
away from one another so that they lock the support.<br>
A centering tube made of plastic is, however, more susceptible to<br>
the introduction of outside forces, as the plastic has a natural<br>
tendency to set, that is, it deforms permanently.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention, while retaining the<br>
above mentioned advantages of the known centering tube, to<br>
eliminate any excessive loading of the centering tube.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present<br>
invention in that the centering tube is provided with a metal<br>
reinforcing ring in those areas in which radial forces are<br>
introduced.<br><br>
Such reinforcing rings must, of course, be so narrow that they do not impair<br>
the favourable damping and vibrational behaviour of the plastic. Reinforcing<br>
rings, however, in'particular when they are designed as steel rings, are above<br>
all desirable in those areas to which a press fit is arranged. The press tension<br>
can be increased using such reinforcing rings, without the press tension<br>
crossing over to the plastic centering tube. The reinforcing rings reduce the<br>
stress in the plastic and prevent any creeping processes. It is hereby<br>
favourable when the relevant reinforcing rings are applied to the side of the<br>
centering tube facing away from the press fit.<br>
A reinforcing ring of this type can, for example, be arranged to the point of<br>
fixation of the centering tube in the spindle bearing housing.A further<br>
reinforcing ring can be arranged to the area of the step bearing housing. Yet<br>
another reinforcing ring can be arranged to the damping spiral. The bending<br>
stress can in particular be thus reduced, so that in the area of the step bearing<br>
flexural strengths of between 13 and 17 N/mm are achieved.<br>
As the centering tube can also stretch under an axial load, a stop is<br>
preferably arranged to the centering tube to prevent axial overloading.<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The spindle 1 according to the present invention, arranged vertically and<br>
designed as a ring spindle, comprises a spindle shaft 2 which is driven to<br>
rotate, said spindle shaft 2 being supported in a neck bearing 3 in the form of<br>
a roller bearing and also being supported in a two-part step bearing 4. The<br>
neck bearing 3 and the step bearing 4 are located in a spindle bearing<br>
housing 5, which has a closed bottom 6.<br>
The spindle bearing housing 5 comprises essentially a sleeve 7 containing the<br>
bottom 6, as well as a bearing head 8 which takes up the neck bearing 3 ,<br><br>
said bearing head 8 being inserted into the sleeve 7 from above by means of<br>
a press fit 9. An oil bath is located in the area of the step bearing 4 inside the<br>
spindle bearing housing 5.<br>
The step bearing 4 comprises a step bearing sleeve 10, which takes up the<br>
radial forces, as well as a thrust plate 11, which takes up the axial forces. The<br>
step bearing sleeve 10 is supported in a centering tube 12, which in turn is<br>
secured by means of a press fit 13 in the bearing head 8. The centering tube<br>
12 consists of a preferably glass-fibre reinforced plastic, which makes the<br>
centering tube 12 flexible to a desired degree and permits radial movements<br>
of the centering tube 12 in the area of the step bearing 4.<br>
Between the cylindrical inner contour of the sleeve 7 and the cylindrical outer<br>
contour of the centering tube 12, an annular gap 14 is located, which takes up<br>
a damping spiral 15 in the known way. The damping spiral 15 is entirely<br>
arranged in the oil bath. By means of cross bore holes 16 in the centering<br>
tube 12, the annular gap 14, which comprises the damping spiral 15, is<br>
connected with the oil bath of the step bearing 4. The damping spiral 15 is<br>
supported upwards on the bearing head 8. The centering tube 12 is supported<br>
on a supporting area 23 on the damping spiral 15, and on a supporting area in<br>
the area of the step bearing 4.<br>
The spindle 1 is secured, together with a plurality of further, adjacently<br>
arranged spindles in a spindle bank 17 (shown only by a dot-dash line) in the<br>
known way. A drive wharve (not shown) is further arranged to the spindle 1,<br>
whereby all drive wharves can be driven by a continuous drive belt extending<br>
in machine longitudinal direction .<br>
Many advantages arise out of the fact that the centering tube 12, as is<br>
generally known, is made of a flexible plastic. For example, the favourable<br>
vibrational behaviour of the plastic can be used to achieve a particularly<br>
smooth running of the spindle shaft 2. A plastic centering tube 12 of this type,<br>
applied for the purposes of centering, possesses an additional advantage<br>
over the known steel centering tubes in that it has damping properties which<br><br>
take up the vibrations quicker, which damping properties combine with the<br>
damping forces of the damping spiral 15 to achieve a particularly smooth<br>
running of the spindle 1.<br>
There is, however, a tendency for introduced stress, in particular bending<br>
stress, to trigger creeping processes in the pllstic centering tubes 12, that is,<br>
that the plastic "sets".This is, of course, to be avoided, if the advantages of<br>
the centering tube 12 made of flexible plastic are not to be cancelled out by<br>
the above mentioned disadvantages. It is therefore provided in accordance<br>
with the present invention', that the centering tube 12 is provided in those<br>
areas, in which radial forces are introduced, with a metal reinforcing ring<br>
18,19,20 made of steel. Areas in which radial forces are introduced are, for<br>
example, the press fit 13 between the centering tube 12 and the bearing head<br>
8, also the press fit 21 for the step bearing sleeve 10 secured in the centering<br>
tube 12 as well as the supporting area 23 of the centering tube 12 against the<br>
damping spiral 15. A reinforcing ring 18,19,20 made of steel is therefore<br>
applied to these areas 13, 21 and 23, which permits increased press stresses,<br>
without triggering any possible creeping processes in the plastic. Thus<br>
significantly higher press stresses are possible than in prior art.<br>
As can be seen in the drawing, the reinforcing rings 18 and 19 are applied to<br>
the side of the centering tube 12 facing away from the respective press fit<br>
13,21.<br>
As the thrust plate 11 is taken up by the centering tube 12, axial forces are<br>
also passed into the centering tube 12. In order to avoid axial overloading, a<br>
stop 22 is arranged at a short distance to the thrust plate 11.When the<br>
centering tube 12 stretches because of axial overloading, it can be supported<br>
axially on the stop 22 of the bottom 6 of the spindle bearing housing 5.<br><br>
