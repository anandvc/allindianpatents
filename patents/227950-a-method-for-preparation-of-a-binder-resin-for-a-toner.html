				<td>The present invention relates to a method for preparation of a binder resin for a toner.<br>
The present invention pertains to an electrophotographic toner that can be used for developing electrostatic images for things like electrostatic printing.<br>
Background Art<br>
The demand for things like copiers and printers that use electrophotographic methods has dramatically increased and the requirements for their properties have also increased relative to the development of office automation. In general, photo-sensitive materials such as seleniurn, amorphous, silicon and organic semiconductors are exposed to light and development is carried out using a developing agent that contains a toner. Currently, there is the requirement that a clear image is formed without fogging and with sufficient image density. Also, currently, toner with excellent low temperature fixing properties is required relative to the strong demands for high durability and being maintenance free from the standpoint of having high speed and stability and being energy efficient, in particular.<br>
A large adhesion surface area with a base to be fixed is generally necessary through decreasing the viscosity of the toner during melting for improving the toner fixing properties. Thus, previously, decreasing the glass transition point (Tg) of the utilized toner binder resin or decreasing the molecular weight was performed. However, the presence of a resin with low glass transition point adversely affects the stability as a powder during use in a toner or during storage because the resin generally has poor anti-blocking properties. Further, when high flow ability resins with low molecular weight come into contact with heated rollers and the toner melts at fixing state, the toner that transfers<br>
onto the heated roller soils the transfer paper that is fed next. What is called offset phenomenon is' a "problem. Further, this trend becomes strikingly obvious to the extent the resin molecular weight  is   low.<br>
Also, the demand for increased efficiency of electrically charged components has also increased relative to high speed copiers and printers. Thus, greater durability is needed for a toner  and  durable  print-resistant stability  is therefore  required.<br>
The improvement of things like the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of binder resins for toners have been proposed. Concretely, attempts were made for . decreasing the molecular weight of precipitated resins and decreasing the fixing temperature. However, the melting point is lowered by decreasing the molecular weight and offset images to the fixing roller develop due to the cohesive power of the resin also simultaneously decreasing. Things like methods that use resins with wide molecular weight distribution by using mixtures of high molecular weight resins and low molecular weight resins or. binding with high molecular weight components of binder resins are performed for preventing these problems.<br>
As binder resins for toners that use the above-mentioned devices, generally, there are mainly those like styrene-acryi resins (for example, J P-B-55-6895 , J P-B-63-32 1 80 , and U.S. Patent No. 5,084,368), polyester resins (for example, J P-A-61-284771 , JP-A-62-291668, J P-B-7-1 0 1 3 1 8 and U.S. Patent No. 4,833,057) and polyol   resins  (for  example,  J P-A-11 -1 89647).<br>
Among these, there is a trend of using polyester type resins<br>
from the standpoint of the balance of fixing properties and offset<br>
resistance    properties.	However,    polyester    resins    have     high<br>
water-absorbing properties due to polarity that originates in the ester group within the resin structure and undesirable eiectricai charge occurs under high temperature and high humidity, and the environmental  stability  is   inadequate.<br>
Further, toners that use the above-mentioned styrene-acryl resins,   polyester  resins  and   polyol   resins  do  not  obtain  sufficient<br>
results for things like high speed copiers and small-scale copiers<br>
with sufficient transfer by the quantity of heat from the heated<br>
fixing     roller     being     difficult.	Thus,     with     the     objective     of<br>
preventing an offset image, there are things like resins with a high weight-average molecular weight, but the resin viscosity increases when using resins with cross-linking carried out and the fixing property deteriorates.<br>
There are methods that add things like paraffin wax and low molecular weight polyolefins as releasing agents for meeting requirements like these. Technology as in J P-B-49-65232, JP-A-50-28840 and J P-A-50-81 342 discloses the utilization of styrene type binder resins. However, even though these methods can prevent the offset phenomenon, they aggravate the blocking-resistant properties (storage properties) and then make it difficult for the toner to exist as a stable powder during its use or its storage, and/or aggravate the image properties. Also, the effects are small even though a prior releasing agent is applied when there is a polyester resin, and therapid deterioration of the developing agent  is  also  confirmed  when  there  are  many  utilized  weights.<br>
Therefore, a developing agent obtaining a high picture quality copier image with adequate fixing properties and offset properties require imparting sufficient electrophotographic properties to the above-mentioned  developing  agent.<br>
But, until now, various methods were attempted for designs such that copier images have been brought about with high picture quality and great detail, but a method that could improve all the aforementioned  problems,  in   particular,  was  not  attained.<br>
Disclosure  of  Invention<br>
The objects for the present invention are the obtaining of a binder resin for a toner with low temperature fixing properties and excellent offset-resistant properties which can prevent offset without applying an offset preventing solution and blocking-resistant properties with the effect of improving the storage properties    and    environmental    stability.    And    another    object    is<br>

Accordingly, the present invention can provide a novel binder resin for toner use, which is a polyester resin made from structural unit derived from a polyester, an epoxy group containing structural unit derived from styrene type resin, structural units with urethane bonding and optionally structural units derived from wax.

corresponding polyester resin (A2). Polyester resin (A2) is a<br>
resin that is generally obtained by carrying out a condensation<br>
polymerization reaction with at least one kind of diol and at least<br>
one kind of dicarboxylic acid as the main components. Further,<br>
with things like the control of the molecular weight distribution and<br>
glass transition temperature as the objective, a plurality of types<br>
of     polyester     resins     can     be     utilized     in     combination.	The<br>
temperature	when	the	above-mentioned	condensation<br>
polymerization reaction is carried out is, generally, 150°C~300°C, desirably 180°C~270°C and more desirably 180°C~250QC. The reaction time is prolonged when the reaction temperature is less than 150°C and decomposition occurs when the temperature exceeds  30 0°C.<br>
As  diols that  are  utilized  as  raw  materials  of  polyester resin (A2),    ethylene    glycol,    1,2-propane    d i o I (pro pyl en e    glycol),    1,3-<br>
propane diol, 1,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol, 2,3-butane diol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,5-pentane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, neopentyl glycol, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexane diol, hydrogenated bisphenol A, ethylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, and propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A can be included.<br>
Among these, ethylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol and neopentyl glycol are preferred, and propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A, triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol and neopentyl glycol are more desirably used.<br>
As dicarboxylic acids that can be used as other raw materials of polyester resin (A2), aliphatic saturated dicarboxylic acids like malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adiplc acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid; aliphatic unsaturated dicarboxylic acids like maleic acid, fumaric acid, citraconic acid and itaconic acid; aromatic dicarboxylic acids like phthalic acid, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid; anhydrides of the aforementioned re.spective dicarboxylic acids (for example, anhydrous succinic acid, anhydrous maleic acid and anhydrous phthalic acid) and low grade alkyl esters of carbon numbers 1-6 of the aforementioned respective dicarboxylic acids (for example, dimethyl succinate, diethyl  maleate  and  dihexyl  phthalate)  can  be  included.<br>
Among these, adipic acid, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid are preferred, and terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid can be  more  desirably  used.<br>
Further, as raw materials of polyester resin (A2), tri-functional or more polyhydric alcohols like glycerin, 2-methyl propane triol, trim ethyl o Ipropan e, trimeth y I o I eth an e, sorbitol and sorbitan; aliphatic monocarboxylic acids like octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid; branched and unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids; aliphatic monoalcohols like octanol, decanol, dodecanol, myristyl   alcohol,   palmityl   alcohol   and   stearyl   alcohol;   aromatic<br>
monocarboxylic acids like benzoic acid and naphthalene carboxylic acid; and tri-functional or more polycarboxylic acids like trimeiiitic acid and pyromellitic acid as well as their anhydrides can be used as needed. Things like controlling the polyester resin (A2) molecular weight and Tg and imparting a branched structure can be carried out by using these compounds. Among these, glycerin, trimethylolpropane, stearic acid, trimeiiitic acid and benzoic acid are preferred, and the use of trimethylolpropane, stearic acid and benzoic  acid  is   more  preferred.<br>
In particular, , the use of one or more types of the above-mentioned tri-functional or more polyhydric alcohols as a raw material of polyester type resin (A2) is preferred to obtain sufficiently high molecular weight polymer by a method of polymerizing the polyester resin to higher molecular weight polymer by using polyisocyanate (afterward, called urethane elongation) in a post-process. The quantity of the tri-functional or more polyhydric alcohol is preferred to be in a range of 0.25-25 mole% of the total alcohol components (total quantity of diol and tri-functional or more polyhydric alcohol) that is the raw material of the polyester resin (A2), and a range of 0.5-20 mole% is even more preferred. When the quantity of the tri-functional or more polyhydric alcohol is less than 0.25 mole%, the offset-resistant properties and durability are inadequate due to the general reaction properties being low and obtaining a high molecular weight polymer of polyester resin (A2) becomes difficult by u rethane-elong ation using the latter-mentioned polyisocyanate. And executing condensation polymerization reactions becomes difficult due to becoming easily gelled when manufacturing a polyester resin (A2) when the used quantity of the tri-functional or more  polyhydric  alcohol  exceeds  25  mole%.<br>
The hydroxyl value of polyester resin (A2) is equal or greater than 4 rngKOH/g and being equal or less than 100 mgKOH/g is preferred, while 80 mgKOH/g is more so. Also, the required number of mg of potassium hydroxide is stated for the hydroxyl value   in   the   present   invention   as   the   required   anhydride   for  the<br>
esterif icatio n   of  hydroxy groups  in   1   g  of  resin  being   neutralized. The   offset-resistant   properties   are   inadequate   due   to   the polymerization  being difficult with the general  urethane elongation reaction   properties   by  the   latter-mentioned   polyisocyanate   being low   when   the   hydroxy!   value   is   4   mgKOH/g   or   less.      When   the hydroxy!   value   exceeds   100   mgKOH/g,   the   gelled   parts   are   often excessive   by   urethane   elongation   using   polyisocyanate,   and   the fixing   properties   are   inadequate.      Further,   the   number-average molecular   weight   (Mn)   of   polyester   resin   (A)   is   preferred   to   be 1000-50000   with   1000-20000   being   even   more   preferable.      The number-average    molecular   weight    being    less   than    1000    is    not preferred    for     the     aspects     of    offset-resistant     properties     and durability,    and    the    case   of   50000    being    exceeded    is    not    also preferred  for  the   aspect  of  fixing   properties.      Further,  the   glass transition  (Tg)  of polyester resin (A2) is preferred to be 30°C~80°C and  more  desirably,   is  40~70°C.      When   less  than  30°C,  the  Tg  of urethane-modif ied    polyester    resin    becomes    low    after    urethane elongation       by       polyisocyanate,       and       the       blocking-resistant properties      (storage      properties)      deteriorate.     When     80°C      is exceeded,     the     Tg     of     u rethane-m od if ication     polyester     resin becomes      exceedingly      high      after      urethane      elongation       by polyisocyanate,   and   the   fixing   properties   deteriorate.      Further, the  acid  value   of the  polyester  type   resin   (A2)   is  preferred  to   be 1-40   mg   KOH/g.      30   mgKOH/g   or   less   is   more   preferred   and   20 mgKOH/g  or  less  is even  more preferred.      The required  potassium hydroxide  number of mg  is stated for  neutralization  of 1   g  of resin for    the    acid    value    in    the    present    invention.        The    reaction properties    with     the     latter-mentioned     epoxy    group    containing styrene   type   resin    (62)    become   exceedingly   low   when   the    acid value    is    less    than    1     mgKOH/g,    and    the    deterioration    of    the blocking-resistant properties  (storage  properties)  is  not preferred when  greater than  40  mgKOH/g.<br>
Two or more types of polyester resins can be used in combination as a polyester resin (A2) of the present invention. In such  cases,  the  polyester  resin   (A2)   preferably  has  an   acid   value<br>
and  a hydroxyl  value which  are within the ranges  mentioned   above as  a  total,   even  though  the  respective  resins   have   acid  values   or hydroxy  values   of  outside  the  ranges  mentioned  above. A preferable embodiment is a polyester resin  (A5) which comprises 50   to   85   weight%   of   polyester   resin    (A3),   which   has   a   hydroxyl value   of   0-15   mgKOH/g,   preferably   0-13   mgKOH/g,    and   an    acid value   of   0-6   mgKOH/g,   preferably   0-5   mgKOH/g,   and   50   to   15 weight%   of   polyester   resin   (A4),   which   has   a   hydroxyl   value   of 30-100 mgKOH/g,  preferably 30-90 mgKOH/g,  and  an  acid value of 7-25      mgKOH/g,      preferably      9~20mgKOH/g.      More      preferably, polyester resin  (A5)  comprises 60 to  85 weight %  of polyester resin (A3)  and  40  to  15  weight%   of  polyester  resin   (A4). Polyester  resin   (A5)   preferably   has   at  least  one   maximum   or   one shoulder  within   the   molecular  weight   range  of   1000-20000,   more preferably  within   the   range   of   1000-15000,   in   a   chromatography m easured  by  GPC.<br>
In the present invention, the structural unit derived from styrene type resin (B) and structural unit derived from epoxy group (C) are components that are derived from conventional epoxy group containing styrene type resins (B2). And the epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) is a resin that is obtained by copolymerization of conventional styrene and at least 1 type or more of epoxy group containing vinyl compound and other polymerizabl e compounds that can be used as needed. The epoxy equivalent being 1,000 g/equivalent or more for an epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) of the present invention is preferred, more so as 1,500 or more, and 30,000 g/equivalent or less, and being 15,000 g/equivalent or less is more preferred. The reactivity with the latter-mentioned polyester resin is exceedingly high when the above-mentioned epoxy equivalent is less than 1,000 g/equivalent and problems are generated for things like the fixing property of epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2). On the other hand, when the above-mentioned epoxy equivalent exceeds 30,000 g/equivalent, the reactivity with the latter-mentioned polyester resin is insufficient and the viscosity is<br>
inadequate  when  used  as  a  toner.<br>
A number-average molecular, weight (Mn) of 1,000 or more, preferably 3,000 or more and 3 0,000 or less, still preferably 25,000 or less, is preferred for an epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) of the present Invention. When the above-mentioned number-average molecular weight (Mn) is less than 1,000, the viscosity is insufficient when used as toner, and the offset-resistant properties are decreased. On the other hand, when 30,000 is exceeded, the compatibility with polyester type resins deteriorates and the viscosity is insufficient when used as a toner. Also, the epoxy equivalent means the weight of epoxy group containing resin that contains 1 gram equivalent of epoxy group   (epoxy oxygen) for the  present invention.<br>

More concretely, the polyisocyanate (D2) ca.n be present in a range that is preferred to be at 0.05-40 weight parts for a total 100 weight parts of polyester resin (A2) and epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2). The isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate (D2) is not preferred from the aspect of offset-resistant properties when there is less than 0.1 molar equivalent per hydroxy group 1 mole equivalent of polyester resin (A2), and unreacted polyisocyanate remains within the obtained urethane modified  polyester resin  when  2.5  mole equivalents  are exceeded.<br>
On the other hand, reaction with epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) after reacting polyester resin (A2) and polyisocyanate   (D2)   is  also   preferred.<br>
In this case, a polyester resin (A2) having a total hydroxy group of 1 molar equivalent, and reacted with 0.1-2.5 molar equivalents of polyisocyanate (&gt;D 2) as the isocyanate group for the polyisocyanate (D2) is preferred, more so' preferred being more than 0.2 molar equivalents or more or being 2.0 molar equivalents or less. The isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate (D2) is not preferred from the aspect of offset-resistant properties when there is    less   than    0.1     molar    equivalent    per    hydroxy    group    1     mole<br>
equivalent of polyester resin (A2), and unreacted p o lyis ocy an at e remains within the obtained urethane modified polyester resin when  2.5  mole  equivalents  are  exceeded.<br>

The urethane modified polyester resin is more preferred at 60 weight parts or more and 97 weight parts or less. The epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) is more preferred at 40 weight parts  or less  and  at 3 weight parts  or  more.<br>
The environmental stability is insufficient when the proportion of the epoxy group-containing styrene type resin (B2) is less than 1 weight % and the fixing properties lessen when higher than  45  weight% .<br>
Further, the above-mentioned reaction can also be performed in the presence of materials like the latter-mentioned charge controlling agents (CCA), coloring agents and releasing agents.<br>

Further, the proportion of the tetrahydrof u ran insoluble part is 50 weight% or less, preferably 35 weigtit% or less and more preferably so, 20 weight% or less. The fixing properties of the toner deteriorate when the tetrahydrofuran insoluble part is greater than 50 weight%.

Further, the molecular weight distribution of the tetrahydrofuran soluble part of a polyester resin (E) (Mw/Mn) being 6 or more is preferred from the aspect of the offset-resistant properties,  more  desirably 7  or  more.<br>
As a binder resin for toner of the present invention, a binder resin for.toner can be used that contains a polyester resin {G) comprises at least a structural unit having a polyester structure (A),<br>

A structural unit derived from wax (F) mentioned above is a structural unit derived from the corresponing wax (F2). Any wax with a melting point of 70~155°C is preferred to be used for the above-mentioned wax (F2); concretely, low molecular weight polyolefin types like polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutene, silicon types that soften when heated, resin group amide types and ceramic wax such as amido oleate, amido erucatericinoleate and amido stearate, and natural wax like rice wax, sugar wax, Japanese lacquer wax, beeswax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax and montan wax, and Fischer-Tropsch wax and modifications of these are given, and at least 1 type among these is used as wax (F2). Blocking is caused, which is considered to originate in an increase of the wax low melting point component of the wax when the melting point of wax (F2) is less than 70°C and the low temperature fixing properties decrease by causing wax melting to be difficult when 1 5 5 ° G  or  more.<br>
A  polyester  resin   (G)   of the  present  invention,   for  example, can  be obtained  using the above-mentioned wax{F2) in  an optional<br>
process     of     a     method     that     manufactures     the     aforementioned polyesterresin(E).<br>
Further, the quantity of the above-mentioned wax (F2) is 1-13 weight parts for a total weight 100 weight parts of polyester resin (A2) and epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2), especially being preferred at 2 weight parts or more and 10 weight parts or less. The effects of the wax do not appear at less than 1 weight part and the soiling of the fixing roller or light sensitive part is extreme, which is considered to originate in increasing the softness  component  of the  wax  when  exceeding   13  weight  parts.<br>
The polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) of the present invention are characterized by containing a resin (E1) that is manufactured with at least a structural unit having a polyester structure (A1) and a structural unit derived from styrene type resin (B)  and  an  structural  unit derived  from   epoxy  group   (C).<br>
The above-mentioned resin (E1), for example, is considered to  be  produced  by  reactions  like:<br>
1.	A carboxyl group of a polyester resin (A2) and an epoxy group<br>
containing  styrene type  resin   (B2)   epoxy group  are  reacted.<br>
A reaction of the carboxyl group within the polyester resin (A2) and the epoxy group of the epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) occurs when manufacturing a polyester resin (E) from the above-mentioned polyester resin (A2) and epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) and polyisocyanate (D2). in this case, hydroxy group generated by the above-mentioned reaction of carbox.yl group and epoxy group may react further with polyisocyanate  (C2).<br>
The carboxyl group of the urethane modified polyester resin and an epoxy group of the epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) react. Then, the hydroxy! group that is generated by the above-mentioned reaction reacts with an isocyanate group of the polyisocyanate  (C2).<br>
Wax is also used in the above-mentioned 1,2 and 3 reactions. The above structural unit having a polyester structure (A1) is a structural   unit  derived  from  mainly polyester  resin   having  a  chain<br>
end  carboxyl  group  of polyester  resin   (A2).<br>
There are also methods wherein styrene type resin with a group like a hydroxy group and a carboxyl group reacts with a polyester as a method that bonds a polyester resin and styrene type resin, and resin (E1) can be manufactured with good efficiency since a reaction for the epoxy group with the carboxyl group occurs quickly and  selectively.<br>
A resin {E1) of the present invention is manufactured by bonding of a unit having a polyester resin structure (A1) and a structural unit derived from styrene type resin (B), and can be analyzed using commonly known means like solvent separation, gel permeation chromatography ((3PC) and broad band nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (broad band NMR) and infrared spectroscopy(lR).<br>
A resin (E1) that is obtained by the above-mentioned methods of 2, 3, 4 can be used as polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) as such due to structural units derived from polyisocyanate (D) and structural units derived from wax (F). A resin (E1) that is obtained by the above-mentioned method of 1 can be a polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G), for example, by reacting with polyisocyanate, mixing with a urethane modified polyester, and reacting with a polyester resin (A2) and a polyisocyanate(D2) and wax (F) as needed, in the presence of (E1).<br>
Bonding with the above-mentioned resin is considered to be by wax (F2) reacting with a polyester resin (A2) and an epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) when a wax (F2) that is used in the present invention has a group that has hydroxyl group and carboxyl group reactivity. The dispersion of the wax components in the polyester resin (G) is improved when the above-mentioned resin and wax (F2) bond, and the blocking-resistant properties are considered  to  be  further  improved  as  a  result.<br>
The   proportion   of   the   tetrahyd rot u r an   insoluble   part   of   a polyester resin   {G)  of the  present invention  is  50 weight %  or  less, desirably 35 weight % or less and more desirably 20 weight % or less. The     fixing      properties     of     the     toner      deteriorate     when      the<br>
tetrahydrofuran   insoluble   part is   greater  than   50   weight%.      More<br>
nitrogen which originates in the.urethane bond is contained in tetrahydrofuran insoluble part than in the tetrahydrofuran soluble part.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the tetrahydrofuran soluble part of polyester resin (G) being 3 or more is preferred from the aspect of the hot offset-resistant properties, more preferred at 6 or more, and further preferred to be 7 or more. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) of the present invention is preferred to be 40~70°C, and 45°C or more and 65°C or less are more preferred. The storage properties deteriorate when the Tg is, less than 40°C and  the fixing   properties  deteriorate  when  70°  is  exceeded.<br>
Further, the respective manufacturing units do not need to be completely bonded for the polyester resin (E) and polyester res5n (G) of the present invention. For example, although unreacted polyester resin (A2) or unreacted epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2) remains, the polyester resin as a whole can be used as a binder resin for a toner, as far as has above-mentioned preferable properties as a binder resin for a toner  or  a  toner.<br>
Analysis of the structure and composition of polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) of the present invention can be performed using conventional methods. Limits on the analysis means are a problem when the said resin has gel analysis. However, the said resin can be completely decomposed by hydrolysis and the obtained carboxylic acid, alcohol and styrene type resins can be measured through analysis using techniques like  liquid  chromatography,  IR   and  NMR.<br>
Binder resins for toner of the present invention are the above-mentioned polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) respectively independent, but mixtures of polyester resin (E) and polyester resin (G) are also preferred. Also, composites with other components added to those in a range without losing the characteristics   are  also  preferred.      Concretely,   any  conventional<br>
ones are preferred as binder resins; for example, ones like polyester resins, polystyrene type resins, styrene-acryl resins, epoxy resins and poiyol resins can be included as other components.<br>
Among these, styrenic resin (H) can be- used preferably. Styrenic resin (H) can be prepared in a similar manner to the preparation of epoxy group containing styrene type resin (B2). However styrenic resin (H) does not have an epoxy group. Styrenic resin (H) preferably has at least one maximum or one shoulder within the molecular weight range of 2000-25000, more preferably within the range of 3000-20000, in a chromatography measured by GPC. The peak molecular weight or the shoulder molecular weight being less than 2000 can not be preferred for the aspects of durability, and the case of 25000 being exceeded is not also preferred for the aspect of fixing properties. Further, a Mw/Mn value, which indicates the molecular weight distribution of the resin, of greater than 3 is preferred for the aspects of offset-resistant properties<br>
Further, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of styrenic resin (H) is preferred to be in the range of 30oC-80oC. When less than 30°C, the Tg of styrenic resin becomes low after urethane elongation, then the blocking-resistant properties, preservability, can be deteriorated. When higher than 80°C, fixing properties can be  detriorated.   More  desirably,  the  Tg  range  is  40~70°C.<br>
Polyester resin (E) and/or polyester resin (G) can be used with styrenic resin (H), and preferable mixing ratio is 75/25 to 99/1 by weight.<br>

at 150°C in a twin-screw kneader PCM30 (Ikegal Ironworks, K.K. product), bulk toner composite was obtained. This composite was phase ground in a hammer mill and finely ground in a jet grinder (Japan Newmatic Co. product Model IDS 2), then toner particles of average particle size 10 µm (5 µm or less : 3 weight%, 20 µm or more : 2 weight%) by flash classification were obtained. The toner grinding properties were determined by measuring the volume average particle size after grinding by conditions with the feed rate of the coarse particles to the jet grinder fixed. The extent of the heated roller contamination was studied by determining the fixing properties and offset properties using this toner with a commercial copier. Further, one with 0.1% hydrophobic silica (Aerosil R9 7 2, Japan Aerosil Co. product) mixed with this toner was stored for 24 hours in an environment of temperature 40°C and relative humidity 60%, and the storage properties were studied from the particle cohesion conditions.

The evaluation conditions of the fixing properties were modified for the following examples and comparative examples. The  details  are  discussed  below.<br>
For the fixing properties, after an unfixed image was formed by a copier with a commercial electrophotographic copier, this unfixed image was fixed using a heated roller with the fixed part of the commercial copier reconstructed. The toner fixing was carried out with the heated roller fixing rate as 190 mm/sec and the heated roller temperature changed each 5°C. A load of 1.0 kg was applied by rubber (Tonbow Empitsu Co. product) by rubbing the obtained fixed image and being rubbed 10 times, and the image density before and after this rubbing was measured by a MacBeth-type refractive densitometer. The change of the image density lowering percentage of the image density at each temperature had a lowest fixing temperature that became 60% or more as the lowest fixing temperature. Further, the heated roller fixing devices that were used here were ones without silicone oil supply structures. Also, the environmental conditions were normal temperature and normal pressure (temperature 22°C, relative  humidity 55%).<br>

Thereafter 0.2 parts by weight of di-t-butyl peroxide was added and reaction was continued for further 2 hours while maintaining the internal temperature at 130°C. Then 0.5 parts by weight of di-t-butyl peroxide was added and reaction was continued for further 2 hours at the same temperature. The polymerization was completed after the mixture was diluted with 123.3 parts by weight of xylene. The resulting polymer(D-1-1) had a molecular weight  peak  at  350000  and  a Tg  of 55°C.<br>
Another flask was flushed with nitrogen and charged with 100 parts by weight of xylene. A solution of 82 parts by weight of styrene, 18 parts by weight of n-butyl acrylate and 3 parts by weight of t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate was added to the flask over 5 hours, while maintaining the internal temperature of the flask at 138°C using an oil bath, and the flask was kept under reflux, then the reaction was continued for 1 hour so that the monomers  polymerized.<br>
Thereafter 0.3 parts by weight of t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate was added and reaction was continued for further 1 hours while maintaining the internal temperature at 98°C. Then 0.5 parts by weight of t-butyl peroxy-2-ethy Ih exanoate was added and reaction was continued for further 2 hours at the same temperature to complete the polymerization. The resulting polymer (D-1-2) had a  molecular  weight  peak  at  12000  and   a Tg  of 56.5°C.<br>
40 parts by weight of the polymer (D-1-1) and 60 parts by weight of polymer (D-1-2) were mixed and flashed into a vessel maintained at 190°C and 10 mmHg so thatsolvents contained in the polymers are removed.

Further 3.0 parts by weight of toiyiene diisocyanate (TDI) was fed to the resulting resin mixture under kneading and delivery. Kneading was  continued  and  then  resin   (C-43)  was  obtained.<br>
The  resulting   polymer  had   a Tg  of 56.6°C   and  a   Mw/Mn  of  larger than  3.<br>
Example  26<br>
85 Parts by weight of resin (C-42 ) powder and 15 Parts by weight of resin (D-1) powder were mixed in a V-blender (available from TOKUJIYU KO S AKUS HO: KK). 100 parts by weight of the mixture obtained above, 6 parts by weight of carbon black (MA-100, available from MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.), 1.5 parts by weight of a charge controlling agent (BONTRON E-84, available from ORIENT CHEMICAL CO., LTD.) and 3 parts by weight of polypropylene wax (Biscol 6JB0P, available from SANYO CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.) were dispersed each other and mixed in a Henschel mixer. Then the mixture was melted and kneaded at 120°C. in a twin-screw kneader PCM 30 (available from IKEGAKI TEKKO LTD.) to obtain clustery toner compositions. These compositions were granulated with a hammer mill, followed by   finely   pulverizing   them    with    a    jet    pulverizer    (IDS    2   Type,<br>
available from  NIPPON  NEWMATIC  CO.,  LTD.)  and then classifying<br>
by airborne classification to obtain toner fine particles having an average particle size of 10 microns (5 µm or less : 3 weight %; 20 µm  or more  : 2 weight %).<br>
Then, 100 parts by weight of the toner fine particles described above were mixed with 0.5 parts by weight of externally added hydrophobic silica ("Aerosil R-972", trade name; product of Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.) in a Henschel mixer to obtain a toner product. The fixing properties, off set-resistant properties and blocking-resistant properties {storage properties) were studied using the toner product. The results are shown in Table 9. Example 27<br>
The experiment was conducted in a similar manner to the example 26 except that 85 parts by weight of resin (C-43) and 15 parts by weight of resin (D-1) were used. The results are shown in Table  9.<br>
