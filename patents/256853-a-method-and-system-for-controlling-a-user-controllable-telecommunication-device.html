				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a method, a system and a device for inputting<br>
user instructions into a user-controllable telecommunication device, whereby a<br>
RFIO transponder is brought into the sphere of scope of an RFID transceiver,<br>
and whereby RFID identification data are transmitted from the RFID transponder<br>
to the RFID transceiver.<br>
State of the art<br>
In recent years, the number of users of telecommunication devices<br>
has increased rapidly. By now, many persons are in possession of a multitude<br>
of different telecommunication devices, such as, for example, landline terminals<br>
at home or in the office, which are connected via a landline network or via a<br>
mobile radio terminal, usable via a mobile radio network. Telecommunication<br>
devices are controllable by means of user instructions selected by the user. A<br>
user instruction for controlling a telecommunication device creates, for example,<br>
a user-specific configuration of a telecommunication terminal and/or of a central<br>
processing unit of a telecommunication network. A user of a landline telephone<br>
can, by inputting a user instruction, for example control a central processing unit<br>
of a telecommunication network in such a way that calls to this landiine telephone<br>
are forwarded to a mobile radio terminal of the user. The user can, for<br>
example when leaving the workplace, enter this user instruction into the landline<br>
business telephone installed at the workplace, and then remain available on the<br>
mobile radio telephone for calls to the business number. A user instruction can<br>
however also be applied to the deactivation of a first SIM (Subscriber Identity<br>
Module) card of a first mobile radio terminal and the subsequent activation of a<br>
second SIM card of a second mobile radio terminal, or to the activation of that<br>
SIM card, which has been set aside for incoming calls. A user in possession of<br>
a first mobile radio terminal with features which are especially suitable for business<br>
use, and a second mobile radio device with features especially suited to<br>
leisure time activities, can, by inputting a user instruction for controlling a telecommunication<br>
device, such as, for example, a Home Location Register m this<br>
case, initiate the activation of his preferred mobile radio device. The state of the<br>
art inputting of user instructions is done via the keyboard of a telecommunication<br>
terminal by pressing a combination or sequence of keys. In doing so, the<br>
user can be suitably assisted, for example, by means of a display attached to<br>
the telecommunication device, as well as by a menu-based indication and a<br>
selection of user instructions. Often the inputting of a user instruction is based<br>
on the control method of a telecommunication device which is always the same.<br>
A user who, for example, activates the call forwarding feature when leaving the<br>
office, and deactivates it again in the morning when entering the office, will<br>
therefore execute the same combination and/or sequence or keys every day.<br>
Hereby it is often necessary to observe the indications of a menu-based display<br>
device.<br>
A method is known, for example, from the patent specification US<br>
6,446,127 Bi, in which a user of a Personal Information Device (PID) can transmit<br>
data to a central processing unit of a telephone network, whereby a call forwarding<br>
feature is activated or deactivated due to this data, whereby the PID is<br>
programmable to initiate an activation or deactivation at a particular time of day<br>
or according to a calendar that has been entered. A disadvantage of this procedure<br>
is that the user must manage the time of entering a user instruction by<br>
means of inputting corresponding time data into the PID, where even minor<br>
changes in the behavior of the user in comparison with the time schedule stored<br>
in the PID, require adjustments to be made. A further disadvantage of this procedure<br>
is that the user must continue to execute various user instructions using<br>
a menu-based input device.<br>
In the patent application US 2004/0002305, a system for executing<br>
applications on a mobile terminal is described. Transponders with assigned information<br>
are brought to locations accessible to users. A transponder is activated<br>
by means of a wireless signal of the mobile terminal. Information is transmitted<br>
from the transponder to the mobile terminal, whereby an application is<br>
initiated on the mobile terminal.<br>
The patent application EP 0 762 715 describes a call forwarding system.<br>
A user possesses a smart card, which can be installed in an RF jacket. A<br>
smart card reader and a RF transceiver have been assigned to the telephone. A<br>
confirmation signal of the RF jacket is verified by means of a request signal<br>
through the RF transceiver, and a call forwarding feature to the assigned telephone<br>
device is activated, as long as the confirmation signal can be verified.<br>
In the patent application JP 54161807, a system for automatically<br>
changing the functions of a telephone or switchboard is described. The user<br>
carries a transmitter for transmitting electro-magnetic or ultra-sound waves. A<br>
receiver informs the switchboard that the user is in the vicinity of a telephone<br>
set. After this, incoming/outgoing (calls) relating to the user are controlled by<br>
means of a controller or the switchboard.<br>
In recent years, the state of the art technology of so-called RFID<br>
(Radio Frequency Identification) technology has continued to develop. RFID<br>
technology in essence entails an RFID transceiver for acquiring RFID data of a<br>
RFID transponder (TRANSmit/resPOND). RFID transponders are also known in<br>
state of the art technology as RFID tags. RFID data may encompass just one<br>
bit, for example, for monitoring theft at the exit of a department store. For this<br>
type of theft control, RFID transponders are attached to the articles to be monitored.<br>
At the exit of the store, as RFfD transponders are removed from the article<br>
or deactivated after the required payment has been made, an RFID transceiver<br>
checks to see whether such an RFID transponder can be detected. RFID<br>
data can however amount to several hundred kBytes, for example for the<br>
documentation of the manufacturing stages and test results of an industrial work<br>
piece. Such documentation, for example, has the advantage that manufacturing<br>
steps can be optimally adapted to preceding manufacturing steps. RFID transponders<br>
can on the one hand be designed in such a way that RFID data can<br>
only be read out. On the other hand, RFID transponders can also be designed<br>
in such a way that RFID data can be read out of RFID transponders as well as<br>
being written into them. The operating principle of the RFID technology relies on<br>
the capacitative or inductive coupling and decoupling of electro-magnetic<br>
waves, whereby the distance between the RFID transponder and the RFID<br>
transceiver may amount to only a few centimeters, or, for example, up to thirty<br>
meters. Active RFID transponders are equipped with an own energy source, for<br>
example a battery, Passive RFID transponders do not possess an own energy<br>
source. When using a passive RFID transponder, energy for activating the electronics<br>
of the RFID transponder can, for example, be inductively coupled and for<br>
example be tised for charging a condenser. As soon as this condenser possesses<br>
enough energy, the control electronics of the RFID transponder can, for<br>
example, initiate the decoupling of RFID data. The decoupling takes place by,<br>
for example, emitting suitably modulated electro-magnetic waves.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
it is an object of the present invention to suggest a new method and<br>
a new system for inputting user instructions, which do not have the disadvantages<br>
of the state-of-the-art technology.<br>
According to the present invention, these objects are achieved in particular<br>
by the elements of the independent claims. In addition, further advantageous<br>
embodiments emerge from the dependent claims and the description.<br>
These objects are in particular achieved by the invention in that an<br>
RFID transponder is brought into the sphere of scope of an RFID transceiver for<br>
inputting user instructions of a user-controllable telecommunication device,<br>
whereby RFID identification data of the RFID transponder are transmitted to the<br>
RFID transceiver. The RFID identification data and/or an RFID transceiver identification<br>
are transmitted from the RFID transceiver to a collection module,<br>
whereby an assigned user instruction is selected by means of the collection<br>
module as well as by means of tables containing RFID identification data accessible<br>
to the collection module and/or tables containing RFID transceiver<br>
identifications, and whereby the user-controllable telecommunication device is<br>
controlled according to the user instruction that has been selected. Such a procedure<br>
has the particular advantage that the user can quickly and easily initiate<br>
a user instruction. As RFID transponders can be manufactured very cheaply<br>
and very small, the user may for example take along several RFID transponders<br>
and initiate the required user instruction by bringing the corresponding RFID<br>
transponder into the sphere of scope of the RFID transceiver.<br>
According to the invention, RFID identification data as well as the<br>
RFID transceiver identification are transmitted to a collection module, connectable<br>
to the telecommunication network, by means of a connection module, connectable<br>
to the RFID transceiver and a telecommunication network via the telecommunication<br>
network. Such a method has the particular advantage that an<br>
existing telecommunication network can easily be completed by means of the<br>
devices required for executing the procedures according to the present inven<br>
tion. The method according to the invention also has the advantage that inputting<br>
a user instruction is very simple. The method is particularly suited to older<br>
persons and/or those with visual impairments and/or persons with motoric (multiple<br>
sclerosis) or similar disorder (Alzheimer's). These persons are unable to<br>
input complex user instructions into a terminal, but are still able to make an<br>
RFID transponder interact with an RFID transceiver by means of correspondingly<br>
more expansive movements.<br>
In one embodiment, RFID identification data as well as the RFID<br>
transceiver identification are transmitted to a collection module integrable to the<br>
user-controllable telecommunication device. Such a method has the particular<br>
advantage that the collection module may for example be designed as a software<br>
module, so that existing telecommunication devices can easily be completed<br>
with the devices required for executing the methods according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the user instruction relates to the activation<br>
or deactivation of a call forwarding feature for calls intended for a first telecommunication<br>
device to a second telecommunication device. Such a method has<br>
the advantage that a user can very easily activate the user instruction initiating<br>
the call forwarding, for example by means of any suitable connection module.<br>
In another embodiment, the user instruction relates to the selection of<br>
a user profile of a telecommunication terminal. Such a method has the advantage<br>
that a user can easily load a personal user profile into a telecommunication<br>
terminal. In a first phase, the user profile and permitted user instructions can, for<br>
example, be managed via the Internet, for example by means of a PC. In a subsequent<br>
phase, the corresponding user instructions can be activated by means<br>
of an RFID transponder according to the method of the invention. In the user<br>
profile, information concerning languages, gender, location etc. of the user,<br>
which may, for example, be used as a filter for particular services.<br>
In another embodiment, the user instruction relates to the initiation of<br>
a payment in a payment transaction procedure. Such a method has the advantage<br>
that a user can very easily initiate a payment. In this way for example data<br>
content that can be purchased that can be played back via a telecommunication<br>
network as an object (MP3 file) or as a data stream (TV broadcast).<br>
In another embodiment, the user instruction relates to the deactivation<br>
of a first SIM module of a first mobile radio terminal and the activation of a<br>
second SIM module of a second mobile radio terminal. Such a method has the<br>
advantage that a user can switch very easily between the two mobile radio terminals.<br>
In another embodiment, the user-controllable telecommunication device<br>
relates to the switchboard of a landline network or to a Home Location<br>
Register of a mobile radio network or to a Visiting Location Register or to any<br>
other similar register of a mobile radio network. Such a method has the advantage<br>
that changes to such a register can be done from any suitable location.<br>
In another embodiment, the telecommunication network relates to a<br>
mobile radio network and/or a landline network and/or an Internet-based network<br>
and/or a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and/or a Power Line<br>
Communication (PLC) network and/or a cable-based network. Such a method<br>
has the advantage that a high degree of interoperability between the various<br>
telecommunication networks is ensured. Parameters, for example user-related<br>
parameters for the user of a mobile radio network, can, for example, be modified<br>
via a PLC network, in fact, independently of the transmission quality of the<br>
mobile radio network or even in the absence of the coverage of a location by<br>
the mobile radio network or in the absence of a roaming agreement.<br>
In another embodiment, the RFID transceiver is attached to a telecommunication<br>
terminal, whereby the RFID identification data and the RFiD<br>
transceiver identification together with data of the telecommunication terminal<br>
are transmitted to the collection module, and whereby the collection module<br>
selects an assigned user instruction by means of corresponding tables containing<br>
RFID identification data and RFID transceiver identifications as well as a<br>
corresponding table of telecommunication terminals data. Such a method has<br>
the advantage of increasing security during the inputting of a user instruction.<br>
At this point it should be stressed that the present invention, in addition<br>
to the method to which this invention relates, also relates to a system for<br>
executing this procedure.<br>
Brief description of the drawing<br>
The different embodiments of the present invention are described below<br>
with the aid of examples; the examples of the embodiments are illustrated<br>
by the following attached figure:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram, which schematically illustrates a<br>
method and a system for inputting user instructions, whereby an RFID transponder<br>
12 is, for example, brought into the sphere of scope of an RFID transceiver<br>
9.<br>
Embodiment(s) of the invention<br>
in Figure 1 the reference number 1 relates to a telecommunication<br>
network. The telecommunication network 1 can be any network for creating<br>
communication links between network devices, for example a PSTN (Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network) network, a mobile radio network, for example a<br>
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) network, a UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunication Service) network or any other mobile radio network,<br>
an Internet-based network such as a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or a<br>
Power Line Communication (PLC) network or a cable-based network (Cable<br>
TV) or any other telecommunication network for linking remote network devices.<br>
The telecommunication network 1 can also include several different networks,<br>
which can be linked via a suitable network connection module. The telecommunication<br>
network 1 can, for example, include a PSTN network and a mobile radio<br>
network as well as a suitable network connection module, so that network<br>
devices of the mobile radio network are connectable with network devices of the<br>
PSTN network<br>
In Figure 1 the reference number 2 relates to a collection module according<br>
to the invention. The collection module 2 includes devices for storing<br>
RFID identification data and identifications of RFID transceivers as well as devices<br>
for selecting user instructions, as well as for controlling a user-controllable<br>
telecommunication device according to the selected user instruction. The collection<br>
module 2 is preferably designed as a programmed software module to run<br>
on a suitable computer. The person skilled in the art will know that the collection<br>
module will also be partly or wholly designed as hardware. The person skilled in<br>
the art will also understand that the collection module 2 can also be made up of<br>
separated devices, whereby these separated devices, such as, for example, a<br>
device for storing atable and a device for selecting a user instruction, can be<br>
suitably be linked, fof example, via the telecommunication network 1. A collection<br>
module 2 can for example be connected to various user-controllable telecommunication<br>
devices 3 at the same time and thereby be operated from an<br>
independent operator.<br>
In Figure 1 the reference number 3 relates to a user-controllable<br>
telecommunication device. The user-controllable telecommunication device 3 is<br>
for example a central processing unit of a landlme network or a Home Location<br>
Register of a mobile radio network or a Visiting Location Register or any similar<br>
register of a mobile radio network or any other user-controllable telecommunication<br>
device. The collection module 2 can be connected to the user-controlled<br>
telecommunication device 3 via any suitable connection, for example via an<br>
Ethernet cable or via a private network or via the telecommunication network 1<br>
or via any other suitable connection, whereby the user-controlled telecommunication<br>
device 3 is controllable by the collection module 2 via the said connection.<br>
The user-controllable telecommunication device is further connectable to<br>
the telecommunication network 1, whereby services and functions of the usercontrollable<br>
telecommunication device 3, such as, for example, a call forwarding<br>
service or an SIM card localizing service, can be offered in addition to the said<br>
connection to the telecommunication network 1 as well as in addition to devices<br>
connectable to this telecommunication network 1.<br>
In Figure 1 the reference number 4 relates to a mobile radio terminal,<br>
for example to a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) mobile radio<br>
terminal, connectable to the telecommunication network 1 via a mobile radio<br>
connection 5, to a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service) mobile<br>
radio terminal or to any other mobile radio terminal connectable to the telecommunication<br>
network 1. The reference numbers 6, 7, and 8 relate to several landline<br>
terminals, connectable via a landline connection, for example to an analog<br>
landline telephone, an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) landiine telephone,<br>
a VoIP (Voice over IP) telephone or to any other landline terminal connectable<br>
to the telecommunication network 1. Further terminals could for example<br>
be TV equipment, radio receivers or Retinal Scanning Displays (RSD),<br>
which are connected to a telecommunication network and which, for example,<br>
do not possess keyboards or similar input devices. Thereby, for example, the<br>
choice of a film language can be entered by means of the method according to<br>
the invention and a corresponding RFID transponder.<br>
In Figure 1, the reference numbers 9 and 10 relate to two typical configurations<br>
of RFID transceivers. As an example, the RFID transceiver 9 is connectable<br>
to the telecommunication network 1 via a connection module 11. In<br>
addition, the RFID transceiver 10 has, for example, been attached to the landline<br>
terminal 8. In order to execute the method according to the invention, any<br>
suitable arrangement can be selected for an RFID transceiver, whereby RFID<br>
identification data and an RFID transceiver identification can be transmitted to<br>
the collection module 2 via any connection. This way an RFID transceiver can<br>
for example be connected to a cable network socket for transmitting TV signals<br>
and for transmitting Internet data packages, whereby RFID identification data<br>
and an identification of an RFID transceiver can for example be transmitted via<br>
a suitable Internet connection to the collection module 2, In addition an RFID<br>
transceiver can be connected to a mains socket, whereby RFID identification<br>
data and an RFID transceiver identification can be transmitted via a power line<br>
based Internet connection to the collection module 2.<br>
In Figure 1 the reference number 12 relates to an RFID transponder.<br>
The RFID transponder 12 can, for example, be installed in a plastic card, for<br>
example in credit card format, whereby a user can easily carry several such<br>
plastic cards, each with a different RFID transponder, and whereby each of<br>
these plastic cards can be designed in a suitable color or with a suitable inscription<br>
for easy identification by the user. An RFID transponder 12 can however<br>
also be attached to an article of daily use of the user, such as a watch, a key<br>
ring, a mobile radio device or to a personalized ballpoint pen. An RFID transponder<br>
12 is basically suitable to be used with all telecommunication networks.<br>
The manufacturers of the RFID transponder 12 can, for example,<br>
program or store the operators of the telecommunication network 1, for example<br>
the mobile radio network operators, the RFID identification data or codes into<br>
the RFID transponders 12.<br>
, In an embodiment, the RFID transponder 12 is programmed with<br>
RFID identification data or an unambiguous code, to which an identity, for example<br>
the MSISDN or IMSI number of a mobile radio network user, can be assigned.<br>
In another embodiment, several RFID transponders 12 are programmed<br>
with the same RFID identification data or the same code. This way, for example,<br>
user-specific, device-specific or universally valid user instructions can be created.<br>
The agent of data content could also release RFID transponders 12<br>
for the payment for the data content to be transmitted. In case of a payment by<br>
means of the RFID transponder 12, the corresponding amount can be charged<br>
to an account linked to the RFID transponder 12. This account could for example<br>
be a prepaid, debit or postpaid account.<br>
For inputting a user instruction, a user will select the desired RFID<br>
transponder 12 and bring it into the sphere of scope of a desired RFID transceiver<br>
9,10. As soon as the corresponding RFID transceiver 9,10 detects the<br>
RFID transponder 12, the RFID transceiver 9,10 transmits RFID identification<br>
data of the RFID transponder and an RFID transceiver identification to the collection<br>
module 2 via a connection between the RFID transponder and the collection<br>
module 2. The collection module then evaluates the RFID identification<br>
data and the RFID transceiver identification and selects a user instruction according<br>
to the tables containing RFID identification data and the RFID transceiver<br>
identification. The following table shows such a selection of a user instruction<br>
for the example of a call forwarding configuration:<br>
RFID transponders<br>

mobile radio device 4<br>
Deactivate call forwarding<br>
to mobile radio device 4<br>
Activate call forwarding<br>
to landline network device<br>
8<br>
The solution according to the invention provides a large number of<br>
solutions in a variety of applications. An RFID transceiver can, for example, be<br>
incorporated in a plug which is insertable into a mains socket. In addition to the<br>
RFID transceiver the plug includes, for example, a connection module 11 for<br>
connecting the RFID transceiver with a collection module 2, as well as, for example,<br>
electronic keys and/or certificates for securing a data connection between<br>
the connection module 11 and the collection module 2 as described below.<br>
The connection module 11 can for example include an Internet protocol<br>
interface as well as an interface for transmitting Ethernet data packages via the<br>
mains cable, A secure Internet protocol-based connection between the connection<br>
module 11 and the collection module 2 can, for example, be established via<br>
an ADSL modem, also equipped with a mains socket and an interface for<br>
transmitting Ethernet data packages via the mains cable as well as via a corresponding<br>
Internet protocol interface of the collection module 2 as well as corresponding<br>
keys and/or certificates of the collection modules 2. The plug with the<br>
RFID transceiver can be placed at a suitable location, for example at the entrance<br>
to an office. The user of the office can now equip one of his personal articles<br>
of daily use, for example his watch, with an RF(D transponder, whereby<br>
RFID identification data and an RFID transceiver identification are transmitted to<br>
the collection module 2 by means of the connection module 11, as soon as the<br>
user is within the sphere of scope of the RFID transceiver. According to the<br>
invention, this way the user-controllable telecommunication device 3 is<br>
controlled according to a user instruction assigned to the RFID identification<br>
data and the RFID transceiver identification. The sphere of scope of the RFID<br>
transceiver can, for example, be designed in such a way that it covers the entire<br>
office space of the user's office and the user instruction can for example include<br>
the deactivation of call forwarding to the telephone number of a landline<br>
telephone installed in the user's office. The connection module 11 can for<br>
example include means for instructing the RFID transceiver to test the RFID<br>
identification data of the RFID transponder at a particular time, whereby the<br>
connection module 11 will, after a successful test, again transmit the RFID<br>
identification data as well as the RFID transceiver identification to the collection<br>
module 2. The collection module 2 can, for example, include a validation<br>
module, whereby, for example, the validity duration of a user instruction and a<br>
second user instruction are set by the validation module, which second user<br>
instruction is used for controlling the user-controllable telecommunication device<br>
3 after the expiration of the validity period of the user instruction.<br>
In a further example of a possible application of the method according<br>
to the invention, the user-controllable telecommunication device 3 relates to<br>
the in-house switchboard of a business. The collection module 2 is, for example,<br>
installed in this internal switchboard and RFID transceivers are, for example,<br>
installed on the telephone devices operated by the internal switchboard. As<br>
soon as, for example, a user places a plastic card with an RFID transponder<br>
inside the sphere of scope of an RFID transceiver, RFID identification data and<br>
an RFID transceiver identification are transmitted to the collection module 2 by<br>
means of a connection module 11, whereby the collection module controls the<br>
internal switchboard with an appropriate user instruction in such a way that a<br>
user profile assigned to the RFID transponder is, for example, loaded onto the<br>
corresponding telephone device by the internal switchboard. By means of additional<br>
plastic cards with RFID transponders, the user can, for example, also decide<br>
that he does not want to be disturbed for the moment, and calls are, for<br>
example, answered by the internal switchboard with an automatic message or<br>
forwarded to a definable call forwarding number.<br>
In a further example of a possible application of the method according<br>
to the invention, the user-controllable telecommunication device relates to a<br>
central processing unit of a payment transaction process. An RFID transceiver<br>
is for example installed at the cash desk of a store. A client of the store can, for<br>
example, bring an RFID transponder into the sphere of scope of the RFID transceiver<br>
to pay for purchases, whereby RFID identification data and an RFID<br>
transceiver identification are transmitted to a collection module 2. The collection<br>
module 2 thereby obtains sufficient Information for controlling the central processing<br>
unit of the payment transaction procedure by means of a user instruction<br>
in such a way that an appropriate payment transaction can be initiated. In order<br>
to secure this method, an input unit, linked to the cash register or to an RFID<br>
transceiver can be attached to the cash register for entering a personal secret,<br>
whereby this personal secret can be transmitted to the collection module 2 for<br>
verification.<br>
In a further example of a possible application of the method according<br>
to the invention, the RFID transceiver relates to a portable device, which is,<br>
for example, connectable to a WLAN hotspot of a telecommunication network<br>
via a wireless interface by means of a connection module 11. The RFID transponder<br>
12 further relates to small modules that can be installed in the housing<br>
of the RFID transceiver. The housing of the RFID transceiver and the RFID<br>
transponders are designed in such a way that pushing one of the RFID transponders<br>
into the housing of the RFID transceiver initiates the corresponding<br>
user instruction. This has the advantage that the whole device is a single, mobile<br>
and portable unit and that the RFID transponders can not get lost.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
