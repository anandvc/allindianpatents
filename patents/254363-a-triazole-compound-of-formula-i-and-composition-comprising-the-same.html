				<td>The present invention relates to a triazole compound of formula (I) and composition comprising the same.<br>
This invention relates to triazole derivatives and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.<br>
The triazole derivatives of the present invention are vasopressin antagonists. In particular they are antagonists of the V1a receptor and have a number of therapeutic applications, particularly in the treatment of dysmenontioea (primary and secondary).<br>
There is a high unmet need in the area of menstrual disorders and it is estimated that up to 90% of all menstruating women are affected to some degree. Up to 42% of women miss work or other activities due to menstrual pain and it has been estimated that around 600 million work hours a year are tost in the US as a result {Coco, A.S. (1999). Primary dysmenorrhoea. {Review] [30 refs]. American Family Physician, 60, 489-96.}.<br>
Menstrual pain in the lower abdomen is caused by myometrial hyperactivity and reduced uterine blood flow. These pathophysiological changes result in abdominal pain that radiates out to the back and legs. This may result in women feeling nauseous, having headaches and suffering from Insomnia. This condition is caled dysmenorrhoea and can be classified as either primary or secondary dysmenorrhoea.<br>
Primary dysmenorrhoea is diagnosed when no abnormality causing the condition is identified. This affects up to 50% of the female population {Coco, A.S. (1999). Primary dysmenorrhoea. [Review] [30 refs]. American FamHy Physician, 60,489-96.; Schroeder. B. &amp; Sanfilippo, J.S. (1999). Dysmenorrhoea and pelvic pain In adolescents. [Review] [78 refs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America, 46, 555-71}. Where an underlying gynaecological disorder is present, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), fibroids or cancers, secondary dysmenorrhoea will be diagnosed. Secondary dysmenorrhoea Is diagnosed in only approximately 25% of women suffering from dysmenorrhoea. Dysmenorrhoea can occur in conjunction with menorrhagia, which accounts for around 12% of referrals to gynaecology outpatients departments.<br>
Currently, women suffering from primary dysmenorrhoea are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) or the oral contraceptive pill. In cases of secondary dysmenorrhoea surgery may be undertaken to correct the underlying gynaecological disorder.<br><br>
Women suffering from dysmenorrhoea have circulating vasopressin levels which are greater than those observed in healthy women at the same time of the menstrual cycle. Inhibition of the pharmacological actions of vasopressin, at the uterine vasopressin receptor, may prevent dysmenorrhoea.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are therefore potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of disorders, particularly aggression, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, anxiety disorder, asthma, atherosclerosis, autism, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, edema, hypematremia), cataract, central nervous system disease, cerebrovascular ischemia, cirrhosis, cognitive disorder, Cushing's disease, depression, diabetes mellitus] dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), emesis (including motion sickness), endometriosis, gastrointestinal disease, glaucoma, gynaecological disease, heart disease, intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), ischemia, ischemic heart disease, lung tumor, micturition disorder, mittlesmerchz, neoplasm, nephrotoxicity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, obsessive/compulsive disorder, ocular hypertension, predampsla, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labour, pulmonary disease. Raynaud's disease, renal disease, renal failure, male or female sexual dysfunction, septic shock, sleep disorder, spinal cord injury, thrombosis, urogenital tract infection or urolithiasis.<br>
Particularly of interest are the following diseases or disorders: anxiety, cardiovascular disease (including angina, atherosclerosis, hypertension, head failure, edema, hypematremia). dysmenorrhoea (primary and secondary), endometriosis, emesis (including motion sickness), intrauterine growth retardation, inflammation (including rheumatoid arthritis), mittlesmerchz, predampsia, premature ejaculation, premature (preterm) labour and Raynaud's disease.<br>
The compounds of the invention, and their pharmaceutlcally acceptable salts and solvates, have the advantage that they are selective inhibitors of the Via receptor (and so are likely to have reduced side effects), they may have a more rapid onset of action, they may be more potent, they may be longer acting, they may have greater bioavailability or they my have other more desirable properties than the compounds of the prior art.<br>

tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I).<br>
As stated, the invention includes all polymorphs of the compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are so-called "prodrugs" of the compounds of formula (I). Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be inverted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, lydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as "prodrugs". Further information an the use of prodrugs may be found in "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, \CS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and "Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design", Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
'rodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties enow to those skilled in the art as "pro-moieties" as described, for example, in "Design of 3rodrugs" by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:<br>
(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a carboxylic add functionality (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with Ci-a alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (-OH). an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with Ci-6 alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R * H). an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with d-10 alkanoyl.<br>
-urther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br>
rinally, certain compounds of formula (1) may themselves act as prodrugs of other impounds of formula (I).<br><br>
Also within the scope of the invention are the metabolites of the compounds of formula (I) when formed in vivo.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist a; two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl 01 alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or 2/E) isomers are possible, and where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety tautomeric isomerism (tautomerism1) may occur. It follows that a single compound ma) exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Alsc included are add addition or base salts wherein the counter ion is optically active, fa example, D-lactata or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.<br>
Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, fractional crystallisation and chromatography.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (01<br>
the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral HPLC.<br>
I<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compounds of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation and one or both of the diastereomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5%<br>
of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>

The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. MC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as "C, 18F, 19O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.<br>

Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in Pharmaceutical Technology On-line. 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solution^ may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as ah implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and poly(cWactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.<br>

Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™. etc.) injection.<br>
Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant. such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2.3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use. the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.<br>
The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.<br>
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanopartides, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as Meucine, mannitol. or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1ug to 20mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1ul to 100ul. A typical formulation<br>
may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycoi include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.<br>
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve, which delivers a metered amount The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 0.01 ug to 15 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.<br>
Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-,1 controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and paniculate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for<br>
example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.<br>
Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cydodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cydodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cydodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.<br>
Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.<br>
rur administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 0.01 mg to 15 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein.<br>
These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60kg to 70kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to "treatment" include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be tested in the screens set out below:<br>
1.0	V™ Filter Binding Assay<br>
1.1	Membrane Preparation<br>
Receptor binding assays were performed on cellular membranes prepared from CHO cells stably expressing the human VIA receptor, (CHO-hV1A). The CHO-hV1A cell line was kindly provided under a licensing agreement by Marc Thibonnier, Dept. of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Cleveland, Ohio. CHO-hV1A ceils were routinely maintained at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in DMEM/Hams F12 nutrient mix supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. 2 mM L-glutamine. 15 mM HEPES and 400 ug/ml G418. For bulk production of cell pellets, adherent CHO-hV1A cells were grown to confluency of 90-100% in 850 cm2 roller bottles containing a medium of DMEM/Hams F12 Nutrient Mix supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 15 mM HEPES. Confluent CHO-hV1A cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested into ice cold PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm. Cell pellets were stored at -80°C until use. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and homogenised in membrane preparation buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCI. pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCI2 and supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, (Roche). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C and the supernatant was removed and stored on ice. The remaining pellet was homogenised and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 25.000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCI2 and 20 % glycerol and stored in small aliquots at -BO°C<br>
until use. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent and BSA as a standard.<br>
1.2   V.. Filter binding<br>
Protein linearity followed by saturation binding studies were performed on each new batch of membrane. Membrane concentration was chosen that gave specific binding on the linear portion of the curve. Saturation binding studies were then performed using various concentrations of [3H]-arginine vasopressin. [3H]-AVP (0.05 nM - 100 nM) add the Kd and Bmw determined.<br>
Compounds were tested for their effects on [3H]-AVP binding to CHO-hV,A membranes, (3H-AVP; specific activity 65.5 Ci / mmol; NEN Life Sciences). Compounds were solubilised in dimethylsulfoxkte (DMSO) and diluted to working concentration of 10% DMSO with assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 5 mM MgClj and 0.05% BSA. 25 ul compound and 25 ui pHJ-AVP, (final concentration at or below Kd determined for membrane batch, typically 0.5 nM - 0.6 nM) were added to a 96-well round bottom polypropylene plate. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 ul membrane and the plates were gently shaken for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration using a Filtermate Cell Harvester (Packard Instruments) through a 96-well GF/B UniFilter Plate which had been presoaked in 0.5% polyethyteneimine to prevent peptide sticking. The filters were washed three times with 1 ml ice cold wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCI2. The plates were dried and 50 ul Microscint-0 (Packard instruments) was added to each well. The' plates were sealed and counted on a TopCount Mteroplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instruments). Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined using 1 pM unlabelled d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP ([p-mercapto-p.p-cyclopentamethyienepropionyl.O-Me-Tyr^An/J-vasopressin ) (pMCPVP), (Sigma). The radioligand binding data was analysed using a four parameter logistic equation with the min forced to 0%. The slope was free fitted and fed between -0.75 and -1.25 for valid curves. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the mean NSB com from the mean Total cpm. For test compounds the amount of tigand bound to the receptor was expressed as % bound - (sample cpm -mean NSB cpm)/specific binding cpm x100. The % bound was plotted against the concentration of test compound and a sigmoidal curve was fitted. The inhibitory dissociation constant (Kj) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: KrlCso/O+fJ-yKa} where [L] is the concentration of ligand present in the well and Kd is the dissociation constant of the radioligand obtained from Scatchard plot analysis.<br>
2.0   VIA Functional Assay. Inhibition of AVP / Vj^-R mediated Ca2* mobilization bv FLIPR /Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader) (Molecular Devices)<br>
Intracellular calcium release was measured in CHO-hV1A cells using FLIPR, which allows the rapid detection of calcium following receptor activation. The CHO-hV1A cell line was kindly provided under a licensing agreement by Marc Thibonnier, Dept. of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Cleveland, Ohio. CHO-V1A cells were  routinely maintained  at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with  5%  CO2 in DMEM/Hams F12 nutrient mix supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 15 mM HEPES and 400 ug/ml G418. On the afternoon before the assay cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well into black sterile 96-well plates with clear bottoms to allow cell inspection and fluorescence measurements from the bottom of each well. Wash buffer containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and 2.5 mM probenedd and loading dye consisting of cell culture medium containing 4 uM Fluo-3-AM (dissolved in DMSO and pluronic acid),(Molecular Probes) and 2.5 mM probenedd was prepared fresh on the day of assay. Compounds were solubilised in DMSO and diluted in assay buffer consisting of DPBS containing 1% DMSO, 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mM probenedd. The cells were incubated with 100 Ml loading dye per well for 1 hour at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. After dye loading the cells were washed three times in 100 ul wash buffer using a Denley plate washer. 100 ul wash buffer was left in each well. Intracellular fluorescence was measured using FLIPR. Fluorescence readings were obtained at 2s intervals with 50 ul of the test compound added after 30s. An additional 155 measurements at 2s intervals were then taken td detect any compound agonistic activity. 50 ul of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was then added so that the final assay volume was 200 ul. Further fluorescence readings were collected at 1s intervals for 120s. Responses were measured as peak fluorescence intensity (Fl). For pharmacological characterization a basal Fl was subtracted from each fluorescence response. For AVP dose response curves, each response was expressed as a % of the response to the highest concentration of AVP in that row. For ICw determinations , each response was expressed as a % of the response to AVP. IC50 values were converted to a modified K6 value using the Cheng-Prusoff equation which takes into account the agonist concentration, [A], the agonist ECso and the slope: Kb=!C5o/(2+[A]/A5o]n)1/n-1 where [A] is the concentration of AVP, ASO is the ECso of AVP from the dose response curve and n=slope of the AVP dose response curve.<br>
