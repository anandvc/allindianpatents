A PROCESS FOR DIRECT SMELTING METALLIFEROUS FEED MATERIAL<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing molten iron from a metalliferous feed material, such as ores, partly reduced ores, and metal-containing waste streams, in a molten bath-based direct smelting process for producing molten iron from a metalliferous feed material.<br>
The term "direct" smelting process" is understood to mean a process "that produces a molten material, in this case iron, from a metalliferous feed material.<br>
One known molten bath-based direct smelting process for producing molten ferrous metal is the DIOS process.  The DIOS process includes a pre-reduction stage and a smelt reduction stage.  In the DIOS process ore (-8mm) is pre-heated (750Â°C) and pre-reduced (10 to 305s) in bubbling fluidised beds using offgas from a smelt reduction vessel which contains a molten bath of metal and slag, with the slag forming a deep layer on the metal.  The fine (-0.3mm) and coarse (-8 mm) components of the ore are separated in the pre-reduction stage of the process and the -0.3 mm is collected in a cyclone and injected into the smelt reduction furnace with nitrogen whilst the coarse ore is charged by gravity.  Pre-dried coal is charged directly to the smelt reduction furnace -from the top of the vessel. The coal decomposes into char and volatile matter in the . slag layer and the ore dissolves in the molten slag and forms FeO.  The FeO is reduced at the slag/metal and slag/char interfaces to produce iron. The carbon monoxide generated at the metal/slag and slag/char interface generates a foaming slag.  Oxygen is blown through a specially designed lance that introduces the oxygen inside the foamed slag and improves secondary combustion.  Oxygen jets burn carbon monoxide that is generated with the smelting reduction reactions, thereby generating heat that<br><br>
- 2 -	<br>
is transferred first to the molten slag and then to the slag/metal interface by the strong stirring effect of bottom blowing gas.  The stirring gas introduced into the hot metal bath from the bottom or side of the smelt reduction vessel improves heat transfer efficiency and increases the slag/metal interface for reduction and therefore the vessel productivity and thermal efficiency. However, injection rates must be limited as strong stirring lowers secondary combustion due to increased interaction between the oxygen jet and metal droplets in the slag with subsequent lowering of productivity and increased refractory wear.  Slag and metal are tapped periodically.<br>
Another known direct smelting process for<br>
producing molten ferrous metal is the Romelt process.  The Romelt process is based on the use of a large volume, highly agitated slag bath as the medium for smelting metalliferous feed material to metal in a smelt reduction vessel and for post-combusting gaseous reaction products and transferring the heat as required to continue smelting metalliferous feed material.  The metalliferous feed material, coal, and fluxes are gravity fed into the slag bath via an opening in the roof of the vessel.  The Romelt process includes injecting a primary blast of oxygen-enriched air into the slag via a lower row of tuyeres to cause necessary slag agitation and injection of oxygen-enriched air or oxygen into the slag via an upper row of tuyeres to promote post-combustion.  The molten metal produced in the slag moves downwardly and forms a metal layer and is discharged via a forehearth.  In the Romelt process the metal layer is not an important reaction medium.<br>
Another known direct smelting process for producing molten ferrous metal is the AISI process,.  The AISI process includes a pre-reduction stage and a smelt reduction stage.  In the AISI process pre-heated and<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU00/00938<br>
-   3   -<br>
partially pre-reduced iron ore pellets, coal or coke breeze and fluxes are top charged into a pressurised smelt reactor which contains a molten bath of metal and slag.  The coal devolatilises in the slag layer and the iron ore pellets dissolve in the slag and then are reduced by carbon (char) in the slag.  The process conditions result in slag foaming.  Carbon monoxide and hydrogen generated in the process are post combusted in or just above the slag layer to provide the energy recquired for the endothermic reduction reactions.  Oxygen is top blown through, a central, water cooled lance and nitrogen is injected through tuyeres at the bottom of the reactor to ensure sufficient stirring to facilitate heat transfer of the post combustion energy to the bath.  The process offgas is de-dusted in a hot cyclone before being fed to a shaft type furnace for pre-heating and pre-reduction of the pellets to FeO or wustite.<br>
Another known direct smelting process which, unlike the above-described processes, relies on a. molten metal layer as a reaction medium is generally referred to as the HIsmelt process and includes the steps of:<br>
(a)	forming a molten bath having a metal layer<br>
and a slag layer on the metal layer in a<br>
direct smelting vessel;<br>
(b)	injecting metalliferous feed material and<br>
coal into the metal layer via a plurality of<br>
lances/tuyeres;<br>
(c)	smelting metalliferous material to metal in<br>
the metal layer;<br>
(d)	causing molten_material to be projected as<br>
splashes, droplets, and streams above a<br>
quiescent surface of the molten bath to form<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU0O/00938<br>
- 4 -a transition zone; and<br>
(d)  injecting an oxygen-containing gas into the vessel via one or more than one lance/tuyere to post-combust reaction gases released from the molten bath, whereby ascending and thereafter descending splashes, droplets and streams of molten material in the transition zone facilitate heat transfer to the molten bath, and whereby the transition zone minimises heat loss from the vessel via the side walls in contact with the transition zone.<br>
A preferred form of the HIsmelt process is<br>
characterized by forming the transition zone by injecting carrier gas, metalliferous feed material, coal, and fluxes into the bath through lances that extend downwardly and inwardly through side walls of the vessel so that the carrier gas and the solid material penetrate the metal layer and cause molten material to be projected from the bath.<br>
This form of the HIsmelt process is an<br>
improvement over earlier forms of the process which form the transition zone by bottom injection of carrier gas and. coal through tuyeres into the bath which cause droplets and splashes and streams of molten material to be projected from the bath.<br>
The Romelt, DIOS, AISI and HIsmelt direct<br>
smelting processes can use coal as the source of energy and. reductant.  This is an advantage of the direct smelting processes over blast furnace technology which requires coke as the source of energy/reductant.<br>
The Romelt, DIOS , AISI and HIsmelt direct<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU00/00938<br>
-   5   -<br>
smelting processes can operate with,a wide range or metalliferous feed materials.<br>
Iron ore is the major source of metalliferous feed materials for producing molten iron via the Romel.t, DIOS, AISI, and HIsmelt processes.<br>
One process option for the direct smelting<br>
processes is to supply iron ore directly to direct smelting vessels .<br>
Another process option is to pre-heat and<br>
partially reduce iron ore in a solid state in pre-reduction vessels (which could be a shaft furnace "or a fluidised bed or any other suitable vessel), transfer the preheated/partially reduced iron ore to direct smelting vessels containing a molten bath of iron and slag, and smelt the pre-heated/partially reduced iron ore to molten iron in the direct smelting vessels.  This process option may also include using off-gas from the direct smelting vessels to pre-heat/pre-reduce iron ore in the pre-reduction vessels.  One advantage of the process option is that it provides an opportunity to minimise total energy consumption.  One disadvantage of the process option is that undesirable impurities, typically-coal -derived impurities such as sulphur and alkali salts, which volatilise in direct smelting .vessels and are discharged as part of the off-gas, return to the direct smelting vessels with the pre-heated/partially reduced iron ore and accumulate in. the vessels.  Specifically, sulphur reacts with FeO in the pre-reduction vessels and forms FeS and alkali salts condense in. the pre-reduction vessels, and the FeS and condensed alkali salts are transferred to the direct smelting vessels with the pre-heated/partially reduced iron ore.  The return of FeS into a direct smelting vessel disrupts the reaction sites of the smelting process and can significantly affect production.  One solution to<br><br>
- 6 - <br>
this issue is to increase the temperature of the medium for smelting-  However, this leads to increased refractory wear and if pursued too far leads to the partitioning, of phosphorus into the metal rather than the slag, and this is a major disadvantage.<br>
An object of the present invention is to-alleviate .the disadvantage of the known 2-stage direct smelting process described in the,preceding paragraph and in particular where the smelting medium is metal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for direct smelting metalliferous feed material which comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	partially reducing iron oxides in a solid state in a pre-reduction<br>
vessel and producing partially reduced iron oxides ;<br>
(b)	direct smelting partially reduced iron oxides produced in step (a)<br>
to molten iron in a direct smelting vessel which contains a<br>
molten bath of iron and slag and is supplied with a solid<br>
carbonaceous material as a source of reductant and energy and<br>
with an oxygen-containing gas comprising preheated air or<br>
oxygen-enriched air for post-combusting carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen generated  in the vessel,  the solid carbonaceous<br>
material containing sulphur that is volatalised in direct smelting<br>
step (b);<br>
(c)	generating an off-gas that contains sulphur in direct smelting<br>
step (b) and releasing the off-gas from the direct smelting<br>
vessel;<br>
(d)	using a first stream comprising less than 80% by volume of the<br>
off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel in pre-reduction<br>
step (a) to pre-reduce iron oxides in the pre-reduction vessel to<br>
control the amount of sulphur that is returned to the direct<br>
smelting vessel from the pre-reduction vessel; and<br><br>
- 7 -   .<br>
(e) using a second stream of the off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel in pre-reduction step (a) as a source of energy for heating air or oxygen-enriched air before supplying the air or oxygen-enriched air to the direct smelting vessel.<br>
The effect of step (d) of using only, part rather than all of the off-gas from the direct smelting vessel in pre-reduction step (a) is to at least minimise the rate of build-up of undesirable impurities, "typically coal-derived impurities, in the direct smelting vessel.  As is indicated above, a disadvantage of the known 2-stage direct smelting process is that a number of undesirable, impurities, typically coal-derived impurities such as sulphur and alkali salts, that are volatilised in direct smelting vessels are recovered in pre-reduction vessels and thereafter are returned to the direct smelting vessels.<br>
Preferably step (d) includes controlling the<br>
amount of off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel and used in pre-reduction step (a) so that the amount of sulphur in molten iron produced in direct smelting step (b) is less than 0.2 wt% of the total weight of the molten iron ,<br>
Preferably the process includes processing the remainder of the off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel for heating and/or for power generation without returning the majority of the sulphur  in_thÂ±s_-pant- of_the off-gas to the direct smelting vessel.<br>
Preferably step (b) includes post-combusting carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the vessel to a level of at least 40% calculated as<br><br><br>

-   7a  -where:<br>
[CO2 ]= volume % of CO2 in off-gas [H2O] = volume % of H2O in off-gas [CO] - volume % of CO in off-gas [H2] = volume % of H2 in off-gas.<br>
Preferably the molten bath is at a temperature of 1580Â°C or less.<br>
Preferably direct smelting step (b) includes injecting pre-haeated air or oxygen-enriched air into the direct smelting vessel as the oxygen-containing gas.<br>
More preferably the process includes using a<br>
first stream of the off-gas from the direct smelting -vessel. in pre-reduction step (a) and  using  a second stream of the<br><br><br>

off-gas as a source of energy for heating air or oxygen-enriched air before supplying the air or oxygen-enriched air to the direct smelting vessel.<br>
Preferably the second stream includes at least 20% by volume of the off-gas relecised from the direct smelting vessel.<br>
More preferably the second stream includes at least 30 vol.% of the off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel.<br>
It is preferred particularly that the second stream includes at least 40 vol.% of the off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel.<br>
Preferably the process includes removing<br>
entrained sulphur and alkali salts from the second stream prior to using the second stream as the source of energy for heating air or oxygen-enriched air.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-enriched air contains less than 50 volume % oxygen.<br>
Preferably pre-reduction step (a) pre-heats the iron ore to a temperature in the range of 600-1000Â°C-<br>
Preferably the off-gas from pre-reduction step (a) is used as a fuel gas for heating or power generation.<br>
Smelting step (b) may include any suitable direct smelting process and use either the metal or the slag as the smelting medium.<br>
Preferably smelting step (b) includes using the metal as a smelting medium and more preferably as the principal smelting medium.<br><br>

Preferably smelting step (b) includes direct smelting partially reduced iron oxides in accordance with the HIsmelt process which includes the steps of:<br>
(i)  forming the molten bath with a molten iron layer and a molten slag layer on the iron layer in the direct smelting vessel;<br>
(ii) injecting the partially reduced iron oxides and coal into the iron layer via a plurality of lances/tuyeres;<br>
(iii) smelting the partially reduced iron oxides to molten iron in the iron layer;<br>
(iv) causing molten material to be projected as<br>
splashes, droplets, and streams into a space above a nominal quiescent surface of the molten bath and forming a transition zone; and<br>
(v)  injecting the oxygen-containing gas into the direot smelting vessel via one or more than one lance/tuyere and post-combusting carbon monoxide and hydrogen released from the molten bath, whereby the ascending and thereafter descending splashes/ droplets, and streams of molten material in the transition zone facilitate heat transfer to the molten bath, and whereby the transition zone minimises heat loss from the vessel via a side wall of the vessel that is in contact with the transition zone.<br>
The term "quiescent surface" in the context of the molten bath is understood herein to mean the surface of<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU00/00938<br>
	/<br>
-   10   -<br>
the  molten bath under process   conditions   in which  there   is no  gas/solids   injection  and  therefore  no  bath  agitation.<br>
The present   invention,  is   described  further  by way of   example with reference  to   the   accompanying  drawings,   of which:<br>
Figure 1  is  a  flow sheet,   in largely schematic form,   of  one preferred embodiment  of  the process  of  the present   invention;   and<br>
Figure  2   is   a vertical   section  through  a<br>
preferred  form of  a direct   smelting  vessel   for use   in  the process  illustrated in Figure  1.<br>
With reference  to  Figure   1,   iron ore,   typically in the  form of  fines   is  heated  and partially reduced  in a pre-reduction vessel  103  and  is  then transferred at a temperature in the range of  600-1000Â°C to  a direct  smelting vessel  105 and smelted to molten iron in a molten bath in that vessel.<br>
Coal,   fluxes,   and oxygen-enriched air are supplied to the direct  smelting vessel  105.     The coal  is provided as a source of  energy and reductant;   the oxygen-enriched air is provided to past-combust  combustible reaction products generated in-the process;   and the  flux  is provided to form slag.<br>
The pre-reduction vessel   103  may be of  any suitable  type and configuration  for  the   iron  ore  feed material.     For example,   if  the  iron ore  feed  is  lump ore, typically the pre-reduction vessel   is  a shaft  furnace. Further,   if  the  iron ore  feed  is   fines,   typically the pre-reduction vessel is  a fluidised bed-based furnace.<br>
The iron ore  feed material  is heated and<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU/00/00938<br>
-   11   -<br>
partially reduced in the pre-reduction vessel 103 by off-gas released from the direct smelting vessel 105.  The off-gas passes out of the pre-reduction vessel 103 and may be used as a low energy fuel gas for heating or power generation (not shown) .<br>
The off-gas may be transferred directly from the direct smelting vessel 105 to the pre-reduction vessel 103. In that case, the extent of heating and reduction in the pre-reduction vessel 10 3 is a function of the temperature and composition of the off-gas, which in turn is a function of the direct smelting- process operating in the direct smelting vessel 105.<br>
The off-gas may also be transferred from the direct smelting vessel 105 to the pre-reduction vessel 103 via a gas reformer (not shown) or other means which precondition the off-gas upstream of the pre-reduction vessel 103.<br>
In accordance with the present invention/ the off-gas from the. direct smelting vessel 105 is split into two (or more) streams, with one stream being transferred directly or indirectly to the pre-reduction vessel 103 as described in the preceding paragraphs," and with the other stream being used on the combustion side of stoves 107 which pre-heat oxygen-enriched air for post-combusting reaction products in the direct smelting vessel 105.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the purpose of splitting the off-gas stream is two-fold.<br>
Firstly, transferring only part of the off-gas stream to the pre-reduction vessel 103 reduces the rate of accumulation in the direct smelting vessel 105 of undesirable impurities, typically coal-derived impurities<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AU00/O0938<br>
-   12    -<br>
such as sulphur and alkali salts, that volatilise in the direct smelting process and are recovered in the pre-reduction step and are returned to the direct smelting vessel 10 5 with incoming partially reduced iron ore.<br>
Secondly, using part of the off-gas stream to heat the stoves 107 is beneficial from the viewpoint of minimising total energy consumption.  This second advantage applies particularly to air-based direct smelting processes where there is usually more off-gas than is required for heating/reducing iron ore in the pre-reduction vessel 103 and splitting the off-gas does not adversely affect the operation of the pre-reduction vessel 103.<br>
The direct smelting process operating in the direct smelting vessel 105 may be any suitable process and may be a cold oxygen-based system.<br>
The preferred direct smelting process operated in the direct smelting vessel is the HIsmelt process as described in general terms hereinafter with reference to Figure 2 and in more detail in International application PCT/AU99/00538 in the natme of the applicant, and the disclosure in the patent: specification lodged with the International application is incorporated herein by cross-reference .<br>
In the context of the present invention, the direct smelting process described in the International application is based on:<br>
(a)	forming EL molten bath having a molten xron<br>
layer and a molten slag layer on the iron<br>
layer in the direct smelting vessel 105;<br>
(b)	injecting the partially reduced iron ore and<br>
coal and fluxes into the iron layer via a<br><br>
plurality of lances/tuyeres;<br>
(c)	smelting the partially reduced iron ore to<br>
molten iron in the metal layer;<br>
(d)	causing molten material to be projected as<br>
splashes, droplets, and streams into a. space<br>
above a normal quiescent surface of the<br>
molten bath and  forming a transition zone;<br>
and<br>
(e)	injecting the heated oxygen-enriched air<br>
into the direct smelting vessel 105 via one<br>
or more than one lance/tuyere and post-<br>
combusting reaction gases, typically carbos.<br>
monoxide and hydrogen, released from the<br>
molten bath to a level of post-combustion of<br>
at least 40% and generating temperatures of<br>
the order of 2000Â°C or higher in the<br>
transition zone, whereby the ascending and<br>
thereafter descending splashes, droplets aad<br>
streams of molten, material in the transition<br>
zone facilitate heat transfer to the molten.<br>
bath, and whereby the transition zone<br>
minimises heat loss from -the vessel via the<br>
side walls in contact with the transition<br>
zone.<br>
The direct smelting vessel 105 may be any suitable vessel.<br>
The preferred direct smelting vessel is the vessel described in general terms hereinafter with reference to Figure 2 and in more detail in International application PCT/AU99/00537 in the name of the applicant and the disclosure in the patent specification lodged with the International application is incorporated herein by cross-<br><br>

The vessel 105 shown in Figure 2 has a hearth that includes a base 3 and sides 55 formed from refractory bricks; side walls 5 which form a generally cylindrical barrel extending upwardly from the sides 55 of the hearth and which include an upper barrel section 51 and a lower barrel section 53; a roof 7; an outlet 9 for off-gases; a forehearth 77 for discharging molten metal continuously; a forehearth connection 71 that interconnects the hearth and the forehearth 77; and a tap-hole 61 for discharging molten slag.<br>
In use, under steady-state process conditions/ the vessel 105 contains the molten bath which includes a layer 15 of molten iron and a layer 16 of molten slag on the iron layer 15.  The arrow marked by the numeral 17 indicates the position of the nominal quiescent surface of the iron layer 15 and the arrow marked by the numeral 19 indicates the position of nominal quiescent surface of the slag layer 16.  The term "quiescent surface" is understood to mean the surface when there is no injection of gas and solids into the.vessel.<br>
The vessel. 105 also includes 2 solids injection lances/tuyeres 11 extending downwardly and inwardly at an angle of 30-60Â° to the vertical through the side walls 5 and into the slag layer 16.  The position of the lances/tuyeres 11 is selected so that the lower ends are above the quiescent surface 17 of the iron layer 15 under steady-state process conditions.<br>
In use, under steady-state process conditions, the partially reduced iron ore, coal, and fluxes (typically lime and magnesia) entrained in a carrier gas (typically N2) are injected into the iron layer 15 via the lances /tuyeres 11,  The momentum of the solid material/carrier gas causes the solid material and gas to<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
penetrate the iron layer 15.  Carbon partially dissolves into the metal and partially remains as solid carbon.  The pre-reduced iron ore is smelted to iron and the smelting reaction generates carbon monoxide gas.  The gases transported into the iron layer 15 and generated via smelting produce significant buoyancy uplift of molten iron, solid carbon, and slag (drawn into the iron layer 15 as a consequence of solid/gas/injection) from the iron layer 15 which generates an upward movement of splashes, droplets and streams of molten material, and these splashes, and droplets, and streams entrain slag as they move through the slag layer 16.<br>
The buoyancy uplift of molten metal, solid carbon and slag causes substantial agitation in the iron layer 15 and the slag layer 16, with the result that the slag layer 16 expands in volume and has a surface indicated by the arrow 30.  The extent of agitation is such that there is reasonably uniform temperature in the metal and the slag regions - typically, 1450 - 1550Â°C with a temperature variation of the order of 30Â° in each region.<br>
In addition, the upward movement of splashes, droplets and streams of molten material caused by the buoyancy uplift of molten iron, solid carbon, and slag extends into the top space 31 above the molten material in the vessel and:<br>
(a)	forms a transition zone 23; and<br>
(b)	projects some molten material (predominantly<br>
slag) beyond the transition zone and onto<br>
the part of the upper barrel section 51 of<br>
the side walls 5 that is above the<br>
transition zone 23 and onto the roof 7.<br>
In general terms, the slag layer 16 is a liquid<br><br>
WO 01/U091	PCT/AUOO/00938<br>
-   16   -<br>
continuous volume, with gas bubbles therein, and the transition zone 23 is a gas continuous volume with splashes, droplets, and streams of molten metal and slag.<br>
The vessel 105 further includes a lance 13 for injecting the heated oxygen-enriched air into the vessel 105. The lance 13 is centrally located and extends vertically downwardly into the vessel.  The position of the lance 13 and the gas flow rate through the lance 13 are selected so that under steady-state process conditions the oxygen-containing gas penetrates the central region of the transition zone-23 and maintains an essentially metal/slag free space 25 around the end of the lance 13.<br>
la use, under steady-state process conditions, the injection of the oxygen-containing- gas via the lance 13 post-combusts- reaction gases CO and H2 in the transition zone 23 and in the free space 25 around the end of the lance 13 and generates high temperatures of the order of 2000Â°C or higher in the gas space.  The heat is transferred to the ascending and descending splashes droplets, and streams, of molten material in the region of gas injection and the heat is then partially transferred to the iron layer 15 when the metal/slag returns to the iron layer 15.<br>
The free space 25 is important to achieving high levels of post combustion because it enables entrainment of gases in the space above the transition zone 23 into the end region of the lance 13 and thereby increases exposure of available reaction gases to post combustion.<br>
The combined effect of the position of the lance 13, gas flow rate through the lance 13, and upward movement of splashes, droplets and streams of molten material is to shape the transition zone 23 around the lower region of the lance 13 - generally identified by the numerals 27.  This shaped region provides a partial barrier to heat transfer<br><br>
- 17 -by radiation to the side walls 5.<br>
Moreover, under steady-state process conditions, the ascending and descending droplets, splashes and streams of material is an effective means of transferring heat from the transition zone 23 to the molten bath with the result that the temperature of the transition zone 23 in the region of the side wallis 5 is of the order of 1450Â°C-1550Â°C.<br>
The vessel 105 is constructed with reference to the levels of the iron layer 15, the slag layer 16, and the transition zone 23 in the vessel 105 when the process is operating under steady-state process conditions and with reference to splashes, droplets and streams of molten material that are projected into the top space 31 above the transition zone 23 when the process is operating under steady-state operating conditions, so that:<br>
(a)	the hearth, and the lower barrel section<br>
S3 of the side walls 5 that contact the<br>
iron/slag layers 15/16 are formed from<br>
bricks of refractory material<br>
(indicated by the cross-hatching in the<br>
figure);<br>
(b)	at leasts part of the lower barrel<br>
section 53 of the side walls 5 is backed by water cooled panels 8; and<br>
(c)	the upper barrel section 51 of the side<br>
walls 5 and the roof 7 that contact the<br>
transition zone 23 and the top space 31<br>
are formed from water cooled panels 57,<br>
59.<br>
Each water cooled panel 8, 57, 59 (not shown) in<br><br>
WO 01/11091	PCT/AUOO/00938<br>
-   18   -<br>
the upper barrel section 51 of the-side walls 5 has parallel upper and lower edges and parallel side edges and is curved so as to define a section of the cylindrical barrel.  Each panel includes an inner water cooling pipe and an outer water cooling pipe.  The pipes are formed into a serpentine configuration with horizontal sections interconnected by curved sections.  Each pipe further includes a water inlet and a water outlet.  The pipes are displaced vertically so that the horizontal sections of the outer pipe are not immediately behind the horizontal sections of the inner pipe when viewed from an exposed face of the panel, ie the face that is exposed to the interior of the vessel.  Each pannel further includes a rammed refractory material which fills the spaces between the adjacent horizontal sections of each pipe and between the pipes.  Each panel further includes a support plate which forms an outer surface of the panel.<br>
The water inlets and the water outlets of the pipes are connected to a water supply circuit (not shown) which circulates water at high flow rate through the pipes.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the preferred embodiment described, above without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
