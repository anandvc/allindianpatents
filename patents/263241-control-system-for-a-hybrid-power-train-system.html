systems, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, and wherein like elements among the exemplary<br>
embodiments and drawings are numbered alike, Fig. 1 depicts an embodiment of<br>
a powertrain system 10A and control system 15 operative to transmit torque to a<br>
transmission output member 64, e.g., to a transmission output shaft, which is<br>
connected to a driveline 90 of a vehicle. The powertrain system 10A includes an<br>
internal combustion engine 20 and an electro-mechanical transmission 30A<br>
including a first electric machine ('MG-A') 40, a second electric machine ('MG-<br>
B') 50, and a planetary or parallel shaft reduction gear set ('PG') 34. The first<br>
and second electric machines 40 and 50 are depicted as being integrated into the<br>
3<br><br>
transmission 30A, although the disclosure is not so limited. An electric energy<br>
storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 60 is electrically coupled to an inverter module<br>
(MM') 45, described hereinbelow, and an ESD charging device 70. The ESD<br>
charging device 70 is selectively coupled to a remote electric power supply 80 via<br>
an electrical connector 72 when the vehicle is in a static position. The engine 20<br>
opcratively couples to the first electric machine 40 via a transmission input shaft<br>
24 to generate electric power. The second electric machine 50 operatively<br>
couples to the transmission output member 64 via the gear set 34 as shown, or<br>
directly without an intervening gearset. The second electric machine 50 may<br>
transmit tractive torque through the transmission 30A to the driveline 90 for<br>
vehicle propulsion and for regenerative braking. The driveline 90 may comprise a<br>
front-wheel drive system including a transaxle and half-shafts connected to drive<br>
wheels, a rear-wheel drive system including a differential and axles connected to<br>
drive wheels, and other driveline configurations, none of which are shown in<br>
detail.<br>
[0011] The control system 15 provides coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system 10A by controlling operation of the engine 20, transmission<br>
30A, and the first and second electric machines 40 and 50, including controlling<br>
operation of the powertrain system 10A in one of a plurality of powertrain<br>
operating states. The control system 15 comprises a hybrid control module<br>
(hereafter 'HCP') 12, an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 22,<br>
transmission control module (hereafter 'TCM') 32, motor control module<br>
(hereafter 'MCP') 52, and battery pack, or ESD control module (hereafter<br>
4<br><br>
'BPCM') 62. The control system 15 receives operator demands and other inputs<br>
from an operator interface module ('UF) 14 via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus connection 16.<br>
[0012] Transmission 30A selectively transmits power among the engine 20, the<br>
first electric machine 40, the second electric machine 50, and the driveline 90 via<br>
the gear set 34, including selectively applying torque transfer devices, hereafter<br>
referred to as clutches (not shown) but intended to include all varieties of torque<br>
transfer devices including, for example, wet and dry clutches, band clutches, and<br>
brakes. The transmission 30A is controlled by the TCM 32. The TCM 32 is<br>
signally and operatively coupled to the transmission 30A and functions to acquire<br>
data from sensors (not shown) and provide command signals. The TCM 32<br>
determines clutch torques, monitors rotational output speed from a transmission<br>
output sensor (not shown), and monitors outputs from hydraulic pressure sensing<br>
devices (not shown) in the transmission. The TCM 32 selectively controls<br>
pressure control solenoids (not shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) to control<br>
the torque transfer clutches to achieve one of the powertrain operating states.<br>
[0013] The engine 20 preferably comprises a multi-cylinder internal combustion<br>
engine operative to generate and transmit torque to the first electric machine 40.<br>
The engine 20 can be of a spark-ignition type, a compression-ignition type, or<br>
other operating cycle, utilizing available fuels, including but not limited to<br>
gasoline, diesel, and alcohol-based fuels. The engine 20 is controlled by the ECM<br>
22, which is signally and operatively coupled to the engine 20, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors (not shown) and control a variety of<br>
5<br><br>
actuators (not shown) over a plurality of discrete lines (not shown). Acquired<br>
data includes input from a crankshaft position sensor (not shown) to provide<br>
engine speed. Other parameters sensed by ECM 22 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure,<br>
all of which are not shown. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM<br>
22 include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules, all of<br>
which are not shown. The ECM 22 is operative to control the engine 20 to engine<br>
states comprising an engine on state ('ON'), i.e., the engine is fueled and firing,<br>
and an engine off state ('OFF'), i.e., the engine is not fueling and is not firing.<br>
The F^CM 22 can shut off and subsequently restart the engine 20 during ongoing<br>
vehicle operation. The ECM 22 communicates with other control modules via the<br>
LAN bus 16.<br>
[0014] The first and second electric machines 40 and 50 are three-phase AC<br>
electric machines electrically coupled to and controlled by the inverter module 45.<br>
The first electric machine 40 preferably comprises a rotor (not shown) and stator<br>
(not shown), with the rotor operatively connected to the transmission input shaft<br>
24 and the stator grounded to a case (not shown) of the transmission 30A. The<br>
second electric machine 50 preferably comprises a rotor (not shown) and stator<br>
(not shown), with the rotor operatively connected to the transmission output<br>
member 64 via the gear set 34 as depicted, although the disclosure is not so<br>
limited. The stator is grounded to the case of the transmission 30A.<br>
[0015] The inverter module 45 is high voltage DC-coupled to the ESD 60 via<br>
transfer conductors 61. The inverter module 45 preferably comprises a pair of<br>
6<br><br>
complementary three-phase power inverters (not shown) adapted to transmit<br>
electric power to and from the first and second electric machines 40 and 50 via<br>
transfer conductors 41 and 51 respectively. The three-phase power inverters each<br>
preferably comprises a plurality of semiconductor power switching devices, e.g.,<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors ('IGBTs') (not shown) that form a switch mode<br>
power supply configured to receive control commands from the MCP 52. There<br>
is typically one pair of IGBTs for each phase of each of the three-phase electric<br>
machines. States of the IGBTs are controlled to provide motor drive or electric<br>
power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive (or supply)<br>
DC electric power via transfer conductors 41 and transform it to (or from) three-<br>
phase AC power, which is conducted to (or from) the first and second electric<br>
machines 40 and 50 for operation as motors (or generators).<br>
[0016] The MCP 52 controls the inverter module 45 to achieve desired motor<br>
torques. The MCP 52 controls the IGBTs of the inverter module 45 to control<br>
transmission of electrical power to and from the first electric machine 40 via<br>
transfer conductors 41, and to control transmission of electrical power to and from<br>
the second electric machine 50 via transfer conductors 51. Electrical current is<br>
transmitted to and from the ESD 60 via transfer conductor 61 in accordance with<br>
whether the inverter module 45 is charging or discharging the ESD 60 during<br>
vehicle operation.<br>
[0017] The ESD 60 comprises a high-voltage electrical energy storage device,<br>
(e.g., one or more batteries or ultracapacitors, or combinations thereof), preferably<br>
batteries for storing and supplying electrical energy for use during operation of<br>
7<br><br>
the powertrain. The BPCM 62 is signally coupled to one or more sensors (not<br>
shown) for monitoring electrical current, voltage, and temperature of the ESD 60<br>
to determine parametric states of the batteries. Such parametric states include<br>
battery state of charge, amp-hour throughput, voltage, available electrical power,<br>
and device temperature. The ESD 60 is electrically coupled to ESD charging<br>
device 70 which is couplable via the electrical connector 72 to the remote electric<br>
power supply 80 when the vehicle is in a static position. The ESD charging<br>
device 70 converts AC electrical power to DC electrical power and transfers it to<br>
the ESD 60. The electric connector 72 may electrically couple current ohmically<br>
through conductive contacts or inductively through known inductive coupling<br>
devices. Known remote electric power supplies 80 include a stationary electrical<br>
grid for supplying electric power to residential and commercial consumers.<br>
[0018] The operator interface module 14 is operatively coupled to a plurality of<br>
devices through which demands from the vehicle operator are determined to<br>
control and direct operation of the powertrain system 10A. The devices may<br>
include an accelerator pedal ('AP') and a brake pedal ('BP') from which an<br>
operator torque request is determined, a transmission gear selector (not shown),<br>
and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector<br>
has a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including direction of the<br>
transmission output member 64, i.e., one of a forward and a reverse direction. An<br>
operator interface device ('OID') 18 may include a control panel comprising a<br>
plurality of elements, e.g., a touch-activated visual display screen, operator<br>
selectable or operator-adjustable buttons, switches, and knobs, none of which are<br>
8<br><br>
shown. The operator interface device 18 is preferably located in a console<br>
accessible to the vehicle operator, and receives control inputs from the operator,<br>
including an input requesting powertrain operation in an electric vehicle ('EV')<br>
operating state, and communicates information to the operator. The operator<br>
interface device 18 can be an element of an on-board navigation system which<br>
can include a global positioning system (GPS), and a wireless communications<br>
system, none of which are shown. The on-board navigation system and global<br>
positioning system can provide signal inputs to the control system 15 useable for<br>
operating the powertrain system 10.<br>
[0019] The HCP 12 provides supervisory control of the powertrain system,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 22, TCM 32, MCP 52, and BPCM 62.<br>
These control modules comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and comprise the control system 15 which provides coordinated<br>
system control of the powertrain system 10. As described in detail hereinbelow,<br>
the control system 15 synthesizes the inputs to determine operator demands and<br>
operating conditions, and executes algorithms to control various actuators to<br>
achieve control targets for certain parameters including fuel economy, emissions,<br>
performance, and drivability, and to protect powertrain system hardware. Based<br>
upon various input signals from the operator interface module 14 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 60, the control system 15 generates various<br>
commands, including: the operator torque request; a commanded output torque to<br>
driveline 90; the engine input torque; clutch torques for the torque transfer<br>
9<br><br>
clutches of the transmission 30; and motor torque commands for the first and<br>
second electric machines 40 and 50.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned control modules may communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via the LAN bus 16, as described herein.<br>
The LAN bus 16 facilitates structured communication between the various control<br>
modules consisting of sensor outputs, control parameters, and device commands.<br>
The communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus 16<br>
provides for robust messaging and interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as<br>
antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide signal<br>
redundancy and integrity.<br>
[0021] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit,<br>
storage mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'), random access memory<br>
('RAM') and electrically programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high<br>
speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and<br>
input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and<br>
buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of control algorithms, comprising<br>
resident executable program instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and<br>
executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. Information<br>
transfer between the various computers is preferably accomplished using the<br>
aforementioned LAN bus 16.<br>
10<br><br>
[0022] Algorithms for controlling the powertrain system 10 and estimating<br>
parametric states are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm<br>
is executed at least once each loop cycle. The algorithms are stored in the non-<br>
volatile memory devices, and are executed by one of the central processing units<br>
to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic<br>
routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset calibrations.<br>
Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5,<br>
25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle operation.<br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0023] The powertrain system 10A depicted with reference to Fig. 1 is<br>
selectively operative in one of several powertrain operating states by controlling<br>
the engine state and operating the second electric machine 40 to generate tractive<br>
torque which can be transmitted to the driveline 90, as detailed in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Powertrain<br>
Operating<br>
State	Tractive Torque Generator	Engine State<br>
EV	second electric machine	OFF<br>
EV C	second electric machine	ON<br>
C	No tractive torque generation	ON<br>
[0024] In an electric vehicle ('EV') operating state, the second electric machine<br>
50 generates the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. The engine 20 and<br>
first electric machine 40 are preferably disconnected from the transmission output<br>
11<br><br>
member 64. In an electric vehicle with charging ('EV-C') operating state, the<br>
second electric machine 50 generates the tractive torque, and the engine state is<br>
ON, generating power for charging the ESD 60 via the first electric machine 40.<br>
In a charging ('C') operating state, the engine state is ON, generating power for<br>
charging the ESD 60 via the first electric machine 40, and there is no tractive<br>
torque generated. Electrical power can be regenerated during braking or coasting<br>
events, regardless of the powertrain operating state.<br>
[0025] Fig. 2 depicts a second embodiment of a powertrain system 10B and the<br>
control system 15. The powertrain system 10B includes the engine 20 and an<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 30B including first and second electric machines<br>
40 and 50, a gear set ('PG') 34', which preferably comprises a planetary gear set,<br>
and selectively engageable clutches A, B, and C. A first gear member of the<br>
gearset 34' is connected to the second electric machine 50. A second gear<br>
member of the gearset 34' is connected to the transmission output member 64. A<br>
third gear member of the gearset 34' may be selectively connected to the<br>
transmission case (i.e. grounded) by applying clutch A. The third gear member of<br>
the gearset 34' may be selectively connected to the first electric machine 40 by<br>
applying clutch B. And, the engine 20 is connected to the transmission input<br>
member 24 which may be selectively connected to the first electric machine 40 by<br>
applying clutch C.<br>
[0026] The powertrain system 10B depicted with reference to Fig. 2 is<br>
selectively operative in one of several powertrain operating states by controlling<br>
the engine state and operating the first and second electric machines 40 and 50 to<br>
12<br><br>
generate tractive torque which can be transmitted to the driveline 90 through<br>
selectively applied clutches, as detailed in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Powertrain<br>
Operating<br>
State	Clutch<br>
Applied	Tractive Torque Generator	Engine State<br>
EV1	A	second electric machine	OFF<br>
EV2	B	first and second electric<br>
machines	OFF<br>
EVT	B,C	engine, first and second<br>
electric machines	ON<br>
E V1 - C	A, C	second electric machine	ON<br>
Charging	C	No tractive torque<br>
generation	ON<br>
[0027] In a first electric vehicle ('EV1') operating state, the second electric<br>
machine 50 generates the tractive torque transmitted to the driveline 90, and the<br>
engine state is OFF. The engine 20 and first electric machine 40 are preferably<br>
disconnected from the transmission in an electric vehicle operating state. In a<br>
second electric vehicle ('EV2') operating state, the first and second electric<br>
machines 40 and 50 generate the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. In<br>
an electrically variable transmission ('EVT') operating state, the engine state is<br>
ON, and the engine 20 and the first and second electric machines 40 and 50<br>
generate the tractive torque. In a first electric vehicle with electric charging<br>
('EV1-C') operating state (alternatively referred to as series hybrid operating<br>
state), the second electric machine 50 generates the tractive torque. The engine<br>
13<br><br>
20 and first electric machine 40 are disconnected from the driveline 90, and the<br>
engine state is ON, generating power for charging the ESD 60 through the first<br>
electric machine 40. In a charging operating state, the engine state can be ON,<br>
and the engine 20 generates power for charging the ESD 60 through the first<br>
electric machine 40, and is disconnected from the driveline 90, i.e., no tractive<br>
torque is transmitted to the driveline 90 from the engine 20. Furthermore, the first<br>
electrical machine 40 can be controlled to start the engine 20, e.g., in the charging<br>
operating state. Electrical power can be regenerated during braking or coasting<br>
events, regardless of the powertrain operating state.<br>
[0028] Fig. 3 depicts a control routine 200, executable as program code<br>
comprising one or more algorithms in one or more of the control modules during<br>
the preset loop cycles, to operate the powertrain system 10, such as the exemplary<br>
embodiments shown with reference to Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Overall the control<br>
routine 200 includes determining operator demands, the current powertrain<br>
operating state, and vehicle operating conditions based upon the operating<br>
demands. An operating strategy is selected, based upon the operator demands, the<br>
current powertrain operating state, and the operating conditions. The powertrain<br>
system 10 is controlled to one of the powertrain operating states to transmit<br>
power, in the forms of driveline tractive torque and electric power generation,<br>
based upon the operating strategy and the operator demands, the powertrain<br>
operating state, and the operating conditions. A person having ordinary skill in<br>
the art will understand that the control routine 200 described herein is applicable<br>
to various electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain configurations, including series-<br>
14<br><br>
hybrid systems, parallel-hybrid systems, power-split hybrid systems, and others.<br>
This includes systems wherein the engine 20 and the first electric machine 40 are<br>
mounted remotely from the transmission 30.<br>
[0029] During vehicle operation, the operator demands are monitored,<br>
preferably through the operator interface module 14. The current powertrain<br>
operating state and current operating conditions are determined (205).<br>
[0030] The control system 15 determines whether the operator demands and<br>
operating conditions dictate selecting an operating strategy that includes<br>
compelling engine operation (210), which includes setting the engine state to ON<br>
(236). The control system 15 may compel engine operation whenever the<br>
available battery power or energy falls below preset thresholds, e.g., as<br>
determined by the state of charge of the ESD 60. The preset threshold for the<br>
state of charge of the ESD 60 may be determined based upon vehicle speed and<br>
the operator torque request. Estimates of available battery power and energy are<br>
determined, preferably in the BPCM 62, based on battery information, including<br>
the state of charge, battery temperature, battery age, average temperature history,<br>
current depth of discharge, cumulative depth of discharge, cumulative amp-hour<br>
throughput, and other factors. Furthermore, the control system 15 may compel<br>
engine operation when the temperature of the ESD 60 exceeds a preset threshold.<br>
Furthermore, the control system 15 may compel engine operation to provide cabin<br>
heating at low ambient temperature conditions, to meet operator expectations for<br>
comfort. Furthermore, the control system 15 may compel engine operation to<br>
provide system cooling and protect components from overheating, such as the<br>
15<br><br>
first and second electric machines 40 and 50 and the inverter module 45.<br>
Furthermore, the control system 15 may compel engine operation periodically in<br>
accordance with a predetermined schedule to systematically exercise engine<br>
components. This includes operating the engine and engine subsystems, e.g., a<br>
fuel system (not shown) to lubricate base engine parts, e.g., pistons and bearings,<br>
and cycle the actuators to prevent degradation due to lack of use. Furthermore,<br>
the control system 15 may compel engine operation to warm up the exhaust<br>
aftcrtreatment in a controlled manner to achieve or maintain temperature of an<br>
exhaust aftertreatment device (not shown).<br>
[0031] After it is determined whether engine operation is compelled, it is then<br>
determined whether the preferred operating strategy comprises an electric vehicle<br>
range maximization strategy (hereafter 'EV range maximization strategy') (212,<br>
230). The EV range maximization strategy operates to maximize range capability<br>
in one of the EV operating states, for example subsequent to operating the vehicle<br>
in a geographic region whereat operation of the engine 20 is permissible. The EV<br>
range maximization strategy is executed, and one of the EV operating states is<br>
subsequently activated as further described herein below. When the EV range<br>
maximization strategy is activated, the control system 15 sets a preferred<br>
charge/discharge rate to compel engine operation to charge the ESD 60 at a<br>
maximum charge rate such that the state of charge of the ESD 60 exceeds a<br>
predetermined minimum state of charge and is within an allowable range, while<br>
meeting all operator commands for torque and auxiliary functions (228, 232).<br>
Therefore, the EV range maximization strategy includes operation of the engine<br>
16<br><br>
and charging of the ESD 60 and may be accomplished in powertrain operating<br>
states that are not purely electric vehicle operating states (i.e. operating states<br>
wherein the engine state is OFF) and include series or parallel hybrid powertrain<br>
configurations with appropriate power splits to ensure driveline torque<br>
requirements are met, auxiliary power functions are met, and the preferred charge<br>
rate is met. One having ordinary skill in the art will therefore appreciate that the<br>
electric charging operating states and the electrically variable transmission<br>
operating states of the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 may be employed<br>
in carrying out the EV range maximization strategy. Similarly, one having<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that alternative powertrain configurations<br>
that include fixed gear operating states, such as described herein below with<br>
respect to the embodiments of Figs. 4-6, may also be employed in carrying out the<br>
EV range maximization strategy. One having ordinary skill in the art will<br>
therefore appreciate that in carrying out the EV range maximization strategy, the<br>
powertrain operating state will include an engine state of ON. When the ESD 60<br>
achieves a state of charge within the allowable range, preferably corresponding to<br>
a relatively high state of charge, the control system 15 maintains the ESD 60 at<br>
that state of charge until either the EV range maximization strategy is deactivated<br>
or operation in one of the EV operating states is initiated, either by an input by the<br>
vehicle operator to the operator interface device 18, or by other action related to<br>
the vehicle operation. This may or may not dictate that the engine 20 remains<br>
constantly on, depending on the preferred charge rate and the vehicle drive<br>
schedule in process. As used herein, the terms charge rate and charge/discharge<br>
17<br><br>
rate refer to a time-based rate of electric power flow into or out of the ESD 60,<br>
preferably in amp-hours.<br>
[0032] The EV range maximization strategy can be activated automatically for<br>
example when an incipient electric vehicle operating state is determined. For<br>
example, EV range maximization strategy may be activated when the vehicle is<br>
proximal to and approaching a geographic area where vehicles are restricted to<br>
EV-only operation, using information from the GPS system and map information<br>
which may be made available a priori or obtained via a wireless network while the<br>
vehicle is operating. Alternately, the vehicle operator may select and designate<br>
one or more geographic areas as desirable for EV operation via input to the<br>
operator interface device 18. Alternately, EV range maximization strategy may<br>
be activated if a preset drive path is known which includes portions of required or<br>
desired EV-only operation. Alternately, the vehicle operator may select the EV<br>
range maximization strategy via input to the operator interface device 18<br>
indicating a preference for operating in the EV operating state, causing the control<br>
system 15 to activate the EV range maximization strategy prior to operating in the<br>
EV operating state. The EV range maximization strategy is then activated<br>
preceding entry into the areas of EV operation or in anticipation of the electric<br>
vehicle operating state to achieve a state of charge of the ESD 60 effective to<br>
permit operation using a charge depletion operating strategy subsequent thereto.<br>
[0033] When the engine 20 is not compelled to operate, and the EV range<br>
maximization strategy is not indicated, it is determined whether the charge<br>
depletion operating strategy is permitted (214). The control system 15 determines<br>
18<br><br>
whether there are operating conditions which prevent depleting the charge of the<br>
ESD 60. This includes monitoring health and performance of the ESD 60. For<br>
example, the charge depletion operating strategy is not permitted whenever the<br>
available power and/or energy from the ESD 60 fall below a preset threshold.<br>
The BPCM 62 estimates the available power and energy from the ESD 60 based<br>
on battery information including the state of charge, battery temperature, battery<br>
age. average temperature history, current depth of discharge, cumulative depth of<br>
discharge, and cumulative amp-hour throughput.<br>
[0034] When the charge depletion operating strategy is permitted, it is<br>
determined whether engine-off operation is preferred (216). The control system<br>
15 monitors and reviews conditions which prevent the engine 20 from being<br>
compelled to operate by the control system 15. These conditions include a default<br>
powertrain operating state, wherein the default powertrain operating state<br>
comprises operating in one of the EV operating states until the state of charge of<br>
the ESD 60 falls below a threshold, i.e., the ESD 60 has been depleted. The<br>
vehicle operator may select the EV operating state as a preferred powertrain<br>
operating state using an on-board input device, e.g., selecting EV operation using<br>
to the operator interface device 18. The control system 15 may activate one of the<br>
EV operating states and engine-off operation based upon input from the GPS<br>
system to the operator interface device 18, when the vehicle approaches a<br>
geographic area where vehicles are restricted to EV-only operation. Alternately,<br>
the operator may select and designate specific areas as desired for EV-only<br>
operation, utilizing the GPS system and on-board electronic maps made available<br>
19<br><br>
a priori or obtained via a wireless network while the vehicle is operating.<br>
Alternately, the control system 15 may activate one of the EV operating states<br>
based upon the operator executing a preset drive path, including portions which<br>
have required or desired EV-only operation. When the control system 15<br>
determines the EV operating state is preferred, the engine state is set to OFF, and<br>
the engine is shutdown or continues to be shutdown when it is already shutdown<br>
(220).<br>
(0035] The charge depletion operating strategy is refined to include a preferred<br>
charge/discharge rate for the ESD 60, when engine operation is permitted during a<br>
portion of a trip (218). This includes determining the preferred charge/discharge<br>
rate for the ESD 60, when engine operation is compelled during a portion of the<br>
trip (234). The preferred charge/discharge rate is determined based upon the<br>
operating conditions, including information related to the current trip and the<br>
driving style of the operator. The operator inputs information into the operator<br>
interface device 18 related to the current trip, including, e.g., distance or<br>
destination. The control system 15 monitors and determines the operator's<br>
driving style to optimize the rate of charge depletion of the ESD 60. The<br>
information is preferably organized in a hierarchical fashion wherein more<br>
specific information permits alteration of the drive strategy to improve<br>
performance. There is a base charge/discharge calibration, which includes a<br>
minimum discharge rate for depletion of electric power. The minimum discharge<br>
rate is used by the control system 15 as the preferred charge/discharge rate in the<br>
absence of other information. The minimum discharge rate may minimize fuel<br>
20<br><br>
usage and/or operator cost for an expected distribution of trip distances and<br>
driving styles. The minimum discharge rate may be developed based on a<br>
statistical description of vehicle trips in the target vehicle market.<br>
[0036] As the vehicle is repeatedly operated, the driving pattern for a<br>
specifically identifiable trip may be characterized statistically in terms of speed,<br>
acceleration, and number of stops. Alternately, the operator may select a drive<br>
mode via the user input, comprising, for example, one of city, downtown, rush<br>
hour, and cruising mode, with a corresponding preferred charge/discharge rate<br>
that is determined for the selected drive mode. Additionally, elevation<br>
information as determined either from GPS data or from sensors may be used to<br>
determine whether the terrain is hilly or flat. From this information, the minimum<br>
discharge rate may be modified, for example, to reduce fuel usage for the driving<br>
pattern in use.<br>
[0037] In operation, the control system 15 may identify whether a specifically<br>
identifiable trip in progress. If the specific trip is known, the preferred<br>
charge/discharge rate may be optimized at various points in the trip to minimize<br>
the fuel usage or operating cost. If trip elevation vs. distance is known, this<br>
information may be used to optimize the capture of potential regenerative braking<br>
energy during operation of the vehicle. The control system 15 determines a<br>
preferred charge/discharge rate comprising a charge depletion rate which accounts<br>
for the following factors, when known: trip speed vs. distance, total trip length,<br>
expected future recharge behavior at end of the trip, and, the trip elevation vs.<br>
distance. Various methods may be used to identify occurrence of the specific trip,<br>
21<br><br>
to permit the control system 15 to monitor and capture information about the trip.<br>
This includes the operator entering trip distance via the operator interface device<br>
18; the operator identifying a specific trip, including selection from preset list of<br>
stored trips, or waypoint identification; the control system 15 matching<br>
occurrence of a trip using GPS information; or using information related to speed<br>
acceleration, time and, distance. Furthermore, under conditions wherein the<br>
vehicle deviates from expected trip behavior, preferred charge/discharge rate may<br>
be adjusted to take the deviation into account. Such deviations include, e.g.,<br>
mismatches between expected and actual speeds, deviations from an expected trip<br>
route, and real-time traffic information. In this manner, the baseline or default<br>
preferred charge/discharge rate represents a minimum expected performance.<br>
Vehicle performance is anticipated to improve from the base charge/discharge<br>
rate after a period of learning and adaptation.<br>
[0038] When the engine 20 is not compelled to operate, and the EV range<br>
maximization strategy is not activated, and the charge depletion operating strategy<br>
is not permitted, a charge sustaining operating strategy is selected, which<br>
comprises setting the preferred charge/discharge rate to a value that causes the<br>
average SOC to track a desired target value (222). When the preferred<br>
charge/discharge rate is set to zero, the control system 15 controls operation of the<br>
powertrain system 10 so that the average state of charge of the ESD 60 is within<br>
measurement error of the desired target SOC and within a predetermined level of<br>
hysteresis to prevent engine cycling. The desired target SOC need not be a fixed<br>
value and may vary during the course of vehicle operation taking into account<br>
22<br><br>
factors such as expected demand for and battery capability for delivering power<br>
and energy, expected supply of regenerative braking energy due to terrain and/or<br>
recharge opportunity, and to minimize the long term exposure of the battery pack<br>
to states of charge that cause increased rate of degradation or wearout. The<br>
engine 20 and the first and second electric machines 40 and 50 are controlled to<br>
generate electric power and torque to minimize system losses while maintaining<br>
the state of charge of the ESD 60 (224, 226).<br>
[0039] When the preferred charge/discharge rate is determined, e.g., at any one<br>
of (218, 222, 228) the optimal engine state is determined to minimize system<br>
power loss (224). This includes determining whether the powertrain operating<br>
state includes the engine state as OFF or the engine state as ON, based upon the<br>
charge/discharge rate, the conditions of the ESD 60, and other factors.<br>
[0040] The control system 15 determines an optimal operating point at which to<br>
control the powertrain system 10 to generate the tractive torque which is<br>
transmitted to the driveline 90, to generate power which is transmitted to the first<br>
electric machine 40 to generate electric power, and to regeneratively brake the<br>
vehicle and generate electric power thereby. This includes determining and<br>
controlling speed and torque outputs from the engine 20 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 40 and 50 to meet the operator torque request and any<br>
requirements for charging the ESD 60, and to minimize energy usage and power<br>
loss in the powertrain system 10 when controlled to the selected powertrain<br>
operating state, based upon the operator demands, powertrain states, and<br>
operating conditions (226). This operation includes selecting a preferred one of<br>
23<br><br>
the available powertrain operating states, including, e.g., an electric vehicle<br>
operating state, an electrically variable transmission operating state, an electric<br>
vehicle operating state with electric charging, a charging operating state, a fixed<br>
gear operating state, and a neutral/charging operating state, depending upon the<br>
specific embodiment of the powertrain system 10 employed. Additional<br>
operating conditions taken into account include available electrical energy from<br>
the BSD 60. The available electrical energy in the ESD 60 is taken into account<br>
in order to minimize the probability that the ESD 60 is not discharged below a<br>
predetermined minimum state of charge prior to a subsequent charging<br>
opportunity. Available electrical energy is determined in the BPCM 62 based on<br>
the state of charge, the battery temperature, the battery age, the average<br>
temperature history, the current depth of discharge, the cumulative depth of<br>
discharge, and the cumulative amp-hour throughput. Vehicle energy usage<br>
includes estimated rolling losses and road loads, which may be monitored and<br>
taken into account to modify a projected rate of energy usage. Furthermore, the<br>
system may use fuel cost information in order to select the most cost effective<br>
control between combustible fuel and electricity. The fuel and electricity costs<br>
may be determined based on location, or manually entered, or updated via<br>
communication with the vehicle from external sources.<br>

[0049] In a first electric vehicle ('EV1') operating state, the second electric<br>
machine 50 generates the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. In a second<br>
electric vehicle ('EV2') operating state, the first and second electric machines 40<br>
and 50 generate the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. In a third electric<br>
34<br><br>
vehicle ('EV3') operating state, the first and second electric machines 40 and 50<br>
generate the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. In a fourth electric<br>
vehicle ('EV4') operating state, the first and second electric machines 40 and 50<br>
generate the tractive torque, and the engine state is OFF. In a first electrically<br>
variable transmission ('EVT1') operating state, the engine state is ON, and the<br>
engine 20 and the second electric machine 50 predominantly generate the tractive<br>
torque, although one having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the first<br>
electric machine 40 may provide a reaction torque contributing to the tractive<br>
torque. In a second electrically variable transmission ('EVT2') operating state,<br>
the engine state is ON, and the engine 20 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 40 and 50 generate the tractive torque. In a first fixed gear operating<br>
state ('FG1') the engine 20 and the first and second electric machines 40 and 50<br>
generate the tractive torque. In a second fixed gear operating state ('FG2') the<br>
engine 20 and the second electric machine 50 predominantly generate the tractive<br>
torque. In a third fixed gear operating state ('FG3') the engine 20 and the first<br>
and second electric machines 40 and 50 generate the tractive torque. In a fourth<br>
fixed gear operating state ('FG4') the engine 20 and the first electric machine 40<br>
predominantly generate the tractive torque. In each of the first, second, third, and<br>
fourth fixed gear operating states, speed of the transmission output member 64<br>
directly corresponds to the engine speed and the fixed gear ratio. The engine 20<br>
may generate power for charging the ESD 60 through the first electric machine 40<br>
during any of the operating states when the engine state is ON. In a<br>
neutral/charging operating state, the engine state can be ON, with the engine 20<br>
35<br><br>
generating power for charging the ESD 60 through the first electric machine 40,<br>
and disconnected from the driveline 90, i.e., no tractive torque is transmitted to<br>
the driveline 90 from the engine 20. Furthermore, the first electrical machine 40<br>
can be controlled to start the engine 20 in any of the powertrain operating states in<br>
which the engine state can be ON. Electrical power can be regenerated during<br>
braking or coasting events, regardless of the powertrain operating state.<br>
