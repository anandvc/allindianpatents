				<td>through coprophagy. Other traditional insecticidal compositions cause secondary mortality mainly through saliva transfer. No traditional insecticidal compositions cause multiple forms of secondary mortality. An insecticidal composition causing multiple forms of secondary mortality would have a significant advantage by increasing translocation of the insecticidal composition and its resultant effect on the cockroach population.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition of the present invention causes high direct mortality rates along with high secondary mortality rates through coprophagy, necrophagy, and cannibalism resulting in a very wide range of effect in controlling the cockroach population. The present invention is directed to a composition suitable for use in controlling cockroaches comprising a mixture of a bait matrix and acetamiprid. Other aspects of the present invention will also be apparent.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it relates to a composition suitable for use in controlling cockroaches comprising a mixture of a bait matrix and ii) acetamiprid, wherein the bait matrix is a sweet bait of a carbohydrate source, and the amount of acetamiprid is in the range of 0.05% by weight to 1.0% by weight of all components in the total composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a composition suitable for use in controlling cockroaches comprising a mixture of a bait matrix and acetamiprid. A preferred composition of the present invention is one wherein the amount of acetamiprid present is in the range of 0.05% by weight to 1.0% by weight based on the weight of all components in the total composition, even more preferred is the range of 0.05% by weight to 0.5% by weight of all components in the total composition. Another preferred composition of the present invention is wherein the bait matrix is selected for the group consisting of a sweet bait, a protein bait and a combination of a sweet bait and a protein bait.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for controlling cockroaches comprising applying the composition of the present invention to a locus where cockroach control is needed or expected to be needed. Cockroaches may be selected from the genera consisting of Periplaneta, Blattella and Blatta. Preferably, cockroaches are selected from the group consisting of German cockroach, American cockroach, Australian cockroach, Smokey-Brown cockroach and Oriental cockroach. The locus is selected from the group consisting of a cockroach-infested <br>
structure, a structure that is expected to be or become cockroach-infested and a location adjacent to such structures.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be derived either from technical grade or commercially available formulations of insecticides. For example, formulations of acetamiprid that are particularly useful in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, acetamiprid (sold under the names and trademarks of INTRUDER and ASSAIL), sold as a 70% wettable powder. Using methods known to one skilled in the ait, the above-mentioned technical grade or commercially available formulations of insecticides can be dispersed in a bait matrix to provide a composition containing an insecticidally effective amount of the insecticide.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "insecticide" refers to the active chemical compound or ingredient, such as acetamiprid, that kills insects such as cockroaches. The term "locus" refers to any locations where control of insects, such as cockroaches, is needed or expected to be needed. The term "direct mortality" refers to death of the insects, such as cockroaches, resulting from ingestion of the insecticide. The term "secondary mortality" refers to death of the insects, such as cockroaches, resulting from ingestion of fecal deposits (coprophagy), a cockroach corpse (necrophagy), a live cockroach (cannibalism), reproductive remains (oothecae, unhatched eggs, or embryonic membranes), or cockroach saliva containing an insecticide. The term "% by weight" refers to the weight of the insecticide or specified component as a percent of the total weight of the composition (e.g. including the bait matrix, other insecticides, surfactants, wetting agents, freeze/thaw agents and combinations thereof). The term "bait" or "bait matrix" refers to any edible or palatable substance that may contain a toxicant. The term "sweet bait" refers to any carbohydrate source such as sucrose, glucose or fructose that may contain a toxicant. The term "protein bait" refers to a plant protein source, such as peanut or soy, or an animal protein source, such as liver powder, that may contain a toxicant. The terms "mortality", "percent mortality", "control", "controlling" or "percent control" may be used interchangeably, and refer to the killing of cockroaches.<br><br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope. The examples set forth certain biological data illustrating the efficacy of the compositions of the present invention in controlling cockroaches. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts, percentages, and the like are by weight.<br>
In the examples the following materials were used:<br>
-70% wettable powder of acetamiprid; commercially available as Intruder<br>
from Dupont; -Sweet bait refers to a carbohydrate source such as sucrose, glucose or<br>
fructose; -Protein bait refers to a plant protein source, such as peanut or soy, or a<br>
animal protein source such as liver powder; -MAXFORCE FC fipronil and hydramethylnon is available from Bayer<br>
Environmental Science; -Blank Matrix refers to cat food.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
