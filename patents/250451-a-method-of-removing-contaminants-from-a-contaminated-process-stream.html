				<td>FILTRATION, FLOW DISTRIBUTION AND CATALYTIC<br>
METHOD FOR PROCESS STREAMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field Of The Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method of providing filtration of contaminants from<br>
process streams. In another aspect, this invention relates to a method for providing<br>
flow distribution of process streams in process units. In yet another aspect, this<br>
invention provides filtration or flow distribution or both while concurrently catalyzing<br>
at least one reaction to at least partially remove and/or convert certain chemical<br>
species within the process stream.<br>
2. Description Of Related Art<br>
[0002] Contaminants in process streams can be deleterious to processes and also to<br>
process units. Contaminants can damage process units, potentially resulting in an<br>
environmental or safety incident. Contaminants can also damage processes by<br>
decreasing efficiencies within processes, stopping production, affecting the<br>
specifications of products, or the like. Contaminants can be found in all types of<br>
process streams, such as feed streams, discharge streams, or effluent streams.<br>
Contaminants can affect various types of process units , such as reactors, extractors,<br>
distillation columns, scrubbers, tail gas treaters, incinerators, exchangers, boilers,<br>
condensers, and the like.<br>
[0003] Process units may be configured such that process streams in the unit flows<br>
vertically downward or upward or both. Alternatively, process streams in the unit<br>
may flow radially from the center out or from the external part of the unit to the center<br>
or both.<br>
[0004] Reactors are one type of process unit Many reactors include discrete solid<br>
catalyst particles contained in one or more fixed beds. Catalyst beds are typically<br>
very efficient at trapping contaminants in process streams fed to the catalyst bed.<br>
Such catalyst beds, however, can quickly become clogged by these trapped<br>
contaminants. As the bed becomes clogged, pressure drop across the process unit<br>
rises resulting in eventual premature shutdown of the process unit.<br>
[0005] Partly to mitigate this problem, catalyst bed process units as well as non-<br>
catalyst bed process units are often supplemented with conventional retention material<br>
beds that are somewhat less resistant to clogging. These conventional retention<br>
material beds are typically located at the inlet to the process unit In the case of<br>
catalyst bed process units, the conventional retention material beds are typically inert<br>
to the reactions in the catalyst bed. These conventional retention material beds can be<br>
somewhat effective in trapping or filtering all or some contaminants such as dirt, iron<br>
oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke fines, catalyst fines, sediments or other entrained<br>
foreign particulate material in the process stream entering, within or leaving the<br>
process unit. The trapping of the contaminants is to prevent undesirable material from<br>
clogging or poisoning or otherwise harming the process unit. When these<br>
conventional retention material beds are inert they are typically made of conventional<br>
ceramic materials in the form of pellets, rings, saddles or spheres and typically must<br>
be resistant to crushing, high temperatures and/or high pressures. While these<br>
conventional retention material beds can be somewhat effective in preventing the<br>
process unit from being clogged, the conventional retention material beds themselves<br>
eventually become clogged.<br>
[0006] Conventional retention material beds may also facilitate flow distribution of<br>
the process stream in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the process stream<br>
across the process unit Such behavior will be referred to herein as perpendicular<br>
flow distribution. As an example, in an upflow or downflow process unit, the process<br>
stream flow is in the axial direction and the perpendicular flow distribution is in the<br>
radial direction.<br>
[0007] To increase the efficiency of conventional retention material beds, graduated<br>
layers of these materials in different sizes and shapes along with perforated discs, or<br>
screen baskets, have been used to retard the process unit from becoming clogged with<br>
contaminants such as dirt, iron oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke fines, catalyst<br>
fines, sediments, or other entrained foreign particulate material.<br>
[0008] Conventional retention material beds exposed to contaminants at the inlet to a<br>
process unit will eventually become clogged with contaminants. As this happens, the<br>
pressure drop across the process unit rises, resulting in the eventual shutdown of the<br>
unit. When this happens in catalyst bed process units, it is typical that part of the<br>
catalyst bed itself becomes somewhat or completely clogged with contaminants.<br>
After such shutdown of the process unit, skimming, or removal, of the clogged<br>
portion of the conventional retention material, as well as the clogged portion of the<br>
catalyst bed, is required.<br>
[0009] In addition to clogging by contaminants in the process stream, polymerization<br>
of polymer precursors, e.g., diolefins, found in the process streams fed to catalyst bed<br>
process units may also foul, gum or plug such process units. In particular, two<br>
mechanisms of polymermtion, free radical polymerization and condensation-type<br>
polymerization, may cause catalyst bed fouling, gumming or plugging. The addition<br>
of antioxidants to control free radical polymerization has been found useful where the<br>
process stream has encountered oxygen. Condensation polymerization of diolefins<br>
typically occurs after an organic-based feed is heated. Therefore, filtering prior to the<br>
process stream entering the catalyst bed process unit may not be helpful to remove<br>
these foulants as the polymerization reactions generally take place in the unit.<br>
[0010] It is highly desirable to have retention materials that do not just clog with<br>
contaminants but efficiently and effectively filter contaminants from the process<br>
stream. Efficiency relates to the percent of contaminants removed by such materials<br>
from the process stream, as well as, to the range of sizes of contaminants that can be<br>
removed by such materials. Effectiveness relates to the extent that such materials do<br>
not impede the flow of the decontaminated process stream through the retention<br>
materials. Such materials would desirably remove virtually all contaminants within a<br>
broad range of sizes from the process stream, while not causing an unacceptable<br>
pressure drop increase across the process unit. It is also highly desirable to have<br>
retention materials that promote perpendicular flow distribution. The method of the<br>
present invention for filtration and flow distribution for process streams, when<br>
compared with previously proposed prior art methods, has the advantages of<br>
providing highly efficient and highly effective filtering of contaminants; increasing<br>
the life and activity of catalysts in catalyst bed process units; decreasing catalyst<br>
losses; allowing for the optimization of process unit configuration; improving the<br>
perpendicular flow distribution of process streams into and within process units and<br>
eliminating the need to take process units off-line when conventional retention<br>
material beds have clogged to the point that pressure drop across units have risen to<br>
unacceptable levels. These benefits may result in both capital and operating cost<br>
savings, reduced downtimes, increased process unit performance and extended<br>
process unit operating time.<br>
[0011] Weaknesses of conventional retention material beds are that they are neither<br>
particularly efficient nor particularly effective as filters. Conventional retention<br>
material beds are typically efficient at removing some contaminants from the process<br>
stream for a limited period of time. The contaminants so trapped are typically those<br>
about 50 microns and larger. The effectiveness of conventional retention material<br>
beds suffers due to eventual clogging, which prevents flow of the decontaminated<br>
process stream through the conventional retention material beds and leads to<br>
unacceptable increase in process unit pressure drop. Furthermore, conventional<br>
retention material beds appear to trap contaminants within about the top six to twelve<br>
inches of depth. Deeper beds of conventional retention materials do not increase the<br>
trapping capacity of these materials. Therefore, the art has sought filtration methods<br>
that remove particulate contaminants smaller than 50 microns, that filter particulate<br>
contaminants while allowing the free flow of decontaminated process streams with no<br>
significant rise in process unit pressure drop and that have a filtering capacity that<br>
increases with bed depth, regardless of bed depth.<br>
[0012] Disadvantages associated with current perpendicular flow distribution designs<br>
and methods in process units may result in poor distribution within the process unit<br>
Clogging or other fouling such as that caused by particulate contaminants or the<br>
products of undesired polymerization reactions may also cause maldistribution. The<br>
maldistribution may result in channeling and corresponding bypassing of portions of<br>
the process unit, reduction in the efficiency of contaminant removal and reduction in<br>
unit efficiency. Usually, a maldistribution problem is also evidenced by so-called<br>
temperature hot-spots. Such hot-spots can, for example, lead to increased coking and<br>
reduced activity in catalyst bed process units. Therefore, the art has sought a<br>
perpendicular flow distribution method that may distribute the process stream more<br>
uniformly within the process unit, provide efficient filtering of contaminants, reduce<br>
the occurrence of hot-spots and reduce fouling caused by undesired polymerization<br>
reactions.<br>
[0013] U.S. Patent Nos. 6,258,900 and 6,291,603, both of which are incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties, describe reticulated ceramic materials that are used to<br>
filter and distribute organic feed streams in a chemical reactor. A need exists for<br>
filtering and flow distribution capabilities for other types of process streams besides<br>
organic-based streams and for other types of process units besides chemical reactors.<br>
[0014] It is desirable for the filtering and flow distribution methods for all process<br>
streams and all process units to increase the filtering efficiency and effectiveness of<br>
materials utilized to remove contaminants from process streams, to improve<br>
perpendicular flow distribution within process units, to have unit run length<br>
determined by factors other than pressure drop increase, to minimize pressure drops<br>
across process equipment, and to minimize process safety and environmental<br>
concerns arising from catalyst bed channeling and flow maldistribution, temperature<br>
hot-spots and process unit shutdowns and start-ups.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[0015] In accordance with the invention, the foregoing advantages have been<br>
achieved through the present method of filtering a process stream, for distributing a<br>
process stream within a process unit and for accomplishing one or both while<br>
concurrently catalyzing desired reactions using reticulated elements. The present<br>
invention advantageously provides a method of removing contaminants from a<br>
contaminated process stream. The method preferably is performed by passing the<br>
process stream over a plurality of reticulated elements in a process unit. The<br>
reticulated elements are randomly packed in the process unit such that there is<br>
significant void space between each reticulated element to enhance filtration of<br>
contaminants on a surface of the reticulated elements while allowing the<br>
decontaminated process stream to pass unimpeded through the plurality of reticulated<br>
elements. A surface can include an inner surface and an outer surface. Reticulated<br>
elements made in accordance with the present invention will have more inner surface<br>
area available for filtering than outer surface area. Reticulated elements can include<br>
foam materials and monolith materials. Foam materials generally have a random<br>
partern, while the monoliths have a more uniform partem. The reticulated elements<br>
can be made from any commercially available materials, for example, zirconia<br>
toughened alumina, commonly referred to as ZTA. ZTA is available, in a ceramic<br>
foam, from Fiber Ceramics, Inc. headquartered in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Another<br>
suitable type of ceramic is a monolith, which is manufactured by Coming, Inc.<br>
headquartered in Coming, New York. The process stream can be a liquid stream, a<br>
vapor phase, or a combination of both phases, and the contaminants can include dirt,<br>
iron oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke fines, soot, catalyst fines, sediments or<br>
other entrained foreign particulate matter, salts in distillation columns, particulates in<br>
gas streams, or sulfur or sulfides from tail gas units. The process stream can also be<br>
an organic-based process stream. The reticulated elements should be provided in an<br>
amount sufficient to remove some or all of the contaminants from the process stream.<br>
Another feature of the present invention may include the step of providing a<br>
decontaminated process stream for further processing.<br>
[0016] More particularly, the invention relates to a process for improving stream<br>
quality of process streams entering to process units. An exemplary example includes<br>
improving stream quality of organic-based process streams going to catalytic bed<br>
process units. Preferably, the catalytic bed process units use discrete, solid element,<br>
fixed catalyst beds. The catalytic bed process units can include hydrotreater,<br>
hydrorefiner, hydrocracker, reformer, alkylation, dealkylation, isomerization,<br>
oxidation, esterification, and polymerization reactors. The discrete solid catalyst<br>
particles may be contained in one or more fixed beds and in either an upflow,<br>
downflow or radial flow design.<br>
[0017] In addition to catalytic bed process units, the reticulated elements of the<br>
present invention can be used to remove contaminants from other types of process<br>
equipment. Such process equipment can include incinerators, scrubbers, tail gas<br>
treaters, and distillation columns and any manufacturing units that operate in a<br>
continuous fashion. When used in a distillation column, the reticulated elements can<br>
be placed in the bottom of the distillation column to act as a filter to remove salts<br>
from the distillation process. Removal of salts will reduce the pressure drop across<br>
the tower, allow for better separation efficiency in the column, and increase the time<br>
between downtimes typically required to remove these salts from the column.<br>
[0018] The present invention also advantageously provides a method of perpendicular<br>
flow distribution in process units. This perpendicular flow distribution method<br>
includes providing one or more reticulated elements in the process unit. When only<br>
one reticulated element is used, it is typically large enough to effectively span the<br>
process unit. When multiple reticulated elements are used, they are typically arranged<br>
in a randomly packed bed. Regardless of the configuration of the reticulated<br>
elements, each reticulated element has a plurality of web members that define a<br>
plurality of flow passageways through the reticulated element. A process stream<br>
contacted with the plurality of reticulated elements is therefore subdivided into a<br>
plurality of smaller fluid streams by passing the process stream through the plurality<br>
of flow passageways defined by the web members of each reticulated element. The<br>
flows of the process stream through the flow passageways within the reticulated<br>
elements and through the void spaces between the reticulated elements when multiple<br>
reticulated elements are used provides for effective flow distribution perpendicular to<br>
the flow of the process stream through the process unit. This method can be applied<br>
to process streams that are entering the process unit, at any location within the process<br>
unit, at the exit from the process unit or any combination of these locations. This<br>
method can be applied to process streams while concurrently providing for filtration<br>
of contaminants from the process stream. This method can be applied to process<br>
streams while concurrently performing catalytic reactions to partially or totally<br>
remove or convert desired chemical species in the process stream.<br>
[0019] An additional feature of the present invention can include the step of using<br>
reticulated elements in a variety of shapes. The shapes can include substantially<br>
spherical shaped balls, monoliths, squares, raschig rings, saddles, hollow cylinders,<br>
perforated disks, disks, single sheets, and solid cylinders, among others. Each shape<br>
can be sized to individual specifications. Sizes for the shapes used can include<br>
substantially spherical balls of about 1/8 to 2-inch diameters; monoliths with widths of<br>
about 1/8 to 2-inches and lengths of about 1/8 to 2-inches; squares with widths of about<br>
1/8 to 2-inches and lengths of about 1/8 to 2-inches; raschig rings with inside diameters<br>
of about 1/8 to 1 inch and outside diameters of about 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches, and heights of<br>
about 1/4 to 2 inches; saddle shapes with radii of about 1/4 to 2 inches; hollow cylinders<br>
having inside diameters of about 1/8. to 1 1/4 inches, outside diameters of about 1/4 to 2<br>
inches, and heights of about 1/4 to 3 inches; and solid cylinders having diameters of<br>
about 1/8 to 1 inch and heights of about 1/4 to 2 inches. Custom-made one-piece disks<br>
or single sheet construction can be custom-fit to the physical configuration of a<br>
reactor. A further feature of this aspect of the present invention is that the reticulated<br>
elements can be formed in either a disk or single sheet, each optionally having<br>
perforations. An additional feature of the present invention is that the reticulated<br>
elements when constructed can be formed into a plurality of segments in order to form<br>
an assembled sheet or disk that is custom-fit to the reactor's physical configuration.<br>
[0020] An additional feature of the present invention can include the step of using<br>
reticulated elements in a variety of porosities and pore sizes. The reticulated elements<br>
can be manufactured such that they have a porosity of so many pores per inch ("ppi").<br>
For example, this means that a reticulated element of 30 ppi will, when examined by<br>
one skilled in the art, have on average 30 pores per inch. Given that there are about<br>
25 millimeters per inch, the pore sizes of such a material would be just under one<br>
millimeter. Pore size in this context is the general size of the cavity of the pore<br>
recognizing that pores are not perfect spheres. Another important element of pore<br>
size is the size of the window opening into the pore. It is this measure that determines<br>
the size of the largest particle that be trapped or filtered within the pore. The porosity<br>
range of the reticulated elements of the present invention are from 4 to 800 ppi. This<br>
enables customization of the size and shape of the reticulated elements for the<br>
application constraints including particulate loading and pressure drop constraints.<br>
The pores of the reticulated elements can be in a range of about 6 millimeters to about<br>
100 microns, each being defined by a plurality of web members forming a plurality of<br>
flow passageways through the reticulated elements.<br>
[0021] An additional feature of the present invention can include the step of using<br>
reticulated elements with different pore sizes in the same process unit so as to remove<br>
contaminant materials of a broad range of sizes. The materials of the present<br>
invention can filter contaminants down to about 1 micron in size. Commercially<br>
available retention materials are capable of trapping particles down to about 50<br>
micron in size.<br>
[0022] Another feature of the present invention advantageously provides providing a<br>
plurality of reticulated elements over an entire length of a process unit. The plurality<br>
of reticulated elements can be commingled throughout the process unit with a<br>
catalyst, with multiple catalysts or with other materials, such as structured packing<br>
materials and the like.<br>
[0023] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, tile step of<br>
contacting the contaminated process stream with the reticulated elements may include<br>
depositing a catalyst on the reticulated elements prior to contacting the contaminated<br>
process stream. Another feature of this aspect of the present invention may include<br>
the use of reticulated elements as a substrate having a substantially uniform coating of<br>
a selected catalyst including a porous alumina coating with a Group VI-B metal or a<br>
Group VIII metal, or both. Preferably, the Group VI-B metal is molybdenum and<br>
preferably, the Group VIII metal is either nickel or cobalt. More preferably, the<br>
Group VI-B metal and Group VIII metal are impregnated into the reticulated<br>
elements. The method of the present invention is useful to extend the run life of the<br>
catalyst bed. The catalytically active reticulated elements can be utilized to react<br>
diolefins or other polymer precursors and also to act as a filter and as a flow<br>
distributor. By filtering solids and partially reacting any polymer precursors, e.g.,<br>
diolefins, fouling of the catalyst is reduced, effectively extending the run time of the<br>
reactor.<br>
[0024] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the filtration<br>
method may include the step of filtering solid particulate material or sediments that<br>
form within a process unit in order to reduce fouling or plugging of downstream<br>
equipment. This aspect of the present invention may include the steps of providing<br>
one or more reticulated elements; contacting a process stream containing the<br>
particulate material or sediments with the reticulated elements; removing the<br>
particulate material or sediments from the process stream; and providing a relatively<br>
particulate material or sediments-free process stream for further processing. The<br>
reticulated elements can be located at one or more locations within the process unit or<br>
at the outlet of the process unit or a combination of both. This method of removing<br>
sediments can also be used in distillation columns to provide a relatively sediment<br>
free process stream for further processing. The method of the present invention for<br>
filtering process streams in catalytic bed process units, when compared with prior art<br>
methods, has the advantages of reducing the volume of retention materials required;<br>
lowering capital costs; improving the filtration of the solid particular matter from the<br>
feed streams; decreasing the pressure drop across the system; increasing run time of<br>
the reactor; allowing for the use of catalysts that have higher activity, lowering<br>
operating costs; increasing process safety; and reducing environmental concerns.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0049] With reference to FIG. 1, for treatment of a process stream a single fixed<br>
catalytic bed process unit 22 with reticulated elements 15 in the shape of substantially<br>
spherical balls 122 (FIG. 11) will be described, although as previously discussed other<br>
shapes of the reticulated elements 15 may be used, as well as other process units . If<br>
the process unit 22 is of a downflow configuration, the contaminated process stream<br>
20 will enter the process unit 22 at the inlet 24. The invention may be used in either<br>
fixed or fluidized catalytic bed process units. Preferably, the present invention is used<br>
in one or more fixed beds, in either an upflow or downflow or radial flow<br>
configuration. Preferably, the catalytic bed process units include hydrotreater,<br>
hydrorefiner, hydrocracker, reformer, alkylation, dealkylation, isomerization,<br>
esterification, and polymerization reactors. Contaminants typically found in the feed<br>
stream include dirt, iron oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke fines, soot, catalyst<br>
fines, sediments or other entrained foreign particulate matter, salts in distillation<br>
columns, particulates in gas streams, sulfur or sulfides from tail gas units, or polymer<br>
precursors such as diolefins. A layer 26, preferably layers 26, 28, of reticulated<br>
elements 15 is provided in the vessel in an amount sufficient to filter the contaminants<br>
from the process stream 20 for as long as desired including, but not limited to, as long<br>
as the catalyst within the reactor is sufficiently active to justify operation of the<br>
reactor. Preferably, multiple layers 26, 28 can be provided wherein the size of the<br>
reticulated elements 15 such as balls 122 is graduated from one size in layer 26 to<br>
another size in layer 28 as the incoming process stream flows through the bed of<br>
reticulated elements 15. Reticulated elements can include foam materials and<br>
monolith materials. Foam materials generally have a random pattern, while the<br>
monoliths have a more uniform partem. If a reticulated ceramic element is used, the<br>
reticulated ceramic elements can be made from any commercially available materials,<br>
for example, zirconia toughened alumina, commonly referred to as ZTA. ZTA is<br>
available from Fiber Ceramics, Inc. headquartered in Cudahy, Wisconsin. An<br>
exemplary monolith for use in the present invention is available from Corning, Inc.<br>
headquartered in Coming, New York. The graduated sizing of the reticulated<br>
elements 15 allows the filtering of a broad range of sizes of contaminants.<br>
[0050] The present invention advantageously provides a method of removing<br>
contaminants from a contaminated process stream. The method preferably is<br>
performed by providing reticulated elements preferably randomly packed with a void<br>
space between each reticulated element to enhance filtration of contaminants in such<br>
a way that the decontaminated process stream may pass through the reticulated<br>
material unimpeded. The present invention provides a method whereby the entirety<br>
of the reticulated elements can be utilized to filter contaminants from the process<br>
stream. In catalytic bed process units, the reticulated elements can be sized such that<br>
the catalyst bed has exhausted its catalytic activity before the reticulated elements<br>
have exhausted their ability to filter out contaminant particles. This method enables<br>
use of the entire bed of reticulated elements, as opposed to current methods that<br>
eventually clog the top six to twelve inches of the retention materials conventionally<br>
available. With such materials, beds deeper than about one foot are essentially of no<br>
use in removing particulate contaminants from process streams. Further, with such<br>
materials, once the top of the bed is plugged, the pressure drop in the equipment<br>
begins to escalate, requiring a shutdown to remove and replace the clogged materials<br>
from the process unit.<br>
[0051] Data has been collected from different process units that have experimented<br>
with the reticulated elements of the present invention. The reticulated elements of the<br>
current invention have performed dramatically better than conventional retention<br>
materials available commercially.<br>
Example 1 — Use in a Distillate Hydrotreater<br>
[0052] Data was obtained from a refinery for four distillate lrydrotreaters in virtually<br>
identical process conditions. Two of the hydiotreaters, A and B, contained<br>
conventional reticulated materials, known as "ring grading systems." The remaining<br>
two hydrotreaters, C and D, used the reticulated elements of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 17 shows a comparison of the pressure drop of the four hydrotreaters using<br>
conventional ring grading systems and the reticulated elements of the present<br>
invention. As can be seen in the graph, the pressure drop remained low relative to<br>
start-of-run pressure drop over a period in excess of 450 days in the C and D<br>
hydrotreaters containing the reticulated elements, while the A and B hydrotreaters<br>
using the conventional ring grading system showed a dramatic pressure increase after<br>
only 200 days in service. The results of the pressure drop comparison can be seen in<br>
Table 1. The contaminated process streams in the distillate hydrotreaters were<br>
predominantly in a liquid phase. In the C hydrotreater, the differential pressure was<br>
only 8 psi at 450 days. In the D hydrotreater, the differential pressure was only 0.5<br>
psi at 450 days. The differential pressure for the A and B hydrotreaters was S2.5 psi<br>
and 54 psi respectively. In comparison, the C and D hydrotreaters with the reticulated<br>
elements of the present invention performed significantly better than the conventional<br>
ring grading systems. The lower differential pressure associated with the reticulated<br>
elements of the present invention allows the time between turnarounds to be extended<br>
dramatically.<br><br>
[0053] A typical pressure drop scenario is to have a low pressure drop for the first<br>
months of operation, but then, at a time that is not predictable, the pressure increases<br>
significantly over a relatively short period to a point where the unit must be shutdown<br>
to remove the pluggage, replace the removed material and restart the unit This can<br>
be problematic given the unpredictability of the event, the need to acquire<br>
replacement materials with very short lead-time or to maintain sufficient extra<br>
inventory of replacement materials or to extend the down-time to await delivery of<br>
replacement materials. With use of the reticulated elements in accordance with the<br>
methods described herein, the pressure drop remains low for a predictable period of<br>
time based on the level of contaminants in the process stream and the capacity of the<br>
reticulated elements loaded in the process unit. Sufficient reticulated elements may<br>
be loaded such that the catalyst in the unit is exhausted before the reticulated elements<br>
are saturated.<br>
Example 2 - Use in a Naphtha Hydrotreater<br>
[0054] Data was obtained from a refinery with four naphtha hydrotreaters. Three of<br>
the hydrotreaters (A, B, and C) used conventional ring grading systems, while the<br>
remaining hydrotreater (D) used the reticulated elements of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates that comparative pressure drop between the four hydrotreaters. At<br>
the end of 200 days, the unit with the reticulated elements D experienced minimal<br>
pressure drop, i.e. -4 psi for hydrotreater D, compared to the pressure drop<br>
experienced by the three units containing ring grading systems, i.e. 10 psi for<br>
hydrotreater B and 22 psi for hydrotreater C. The contaminated process streams in<br>
the naphtha hydrotreaters were predominantly in a vapor phase. The reticulated<br>
elements of the present invention filtered efficiently and effectively while the<br>
conventional ring grading systems became clogged.<br>
[0055] Referring again to FIG. 1, unless otherwise noted, in addition to filtering the<br>
contaminated process stream 20, the reticulated material 15 may also enable a<br>
uniform distribution and flow of the incoming process stream 20 to the catalyst bed<br>
32.<br>
[0056] By passing the process stream through a plurality of flow passageways 120<br>
(FIG. 9) defined by web members 123 (FIG. 9) of the reticulated material 15 in layers<br>
26, 28, the incoming process stream 20 may also be distributed by subdividing the<br>
incoming process stream into a plurality of smaller fluid streams and then<br>
resubdividing, a plurality of times, lie smaller streams so that the incoming process<br>
stream is spread uniformly across the fluid entry cross-section 34, taken along line 34<br>
- 34, of the catalyst bed 32. The process stream 20 is reacted in the catalyst bed 32.<br>
Preferably the catalyst bed 32 contains discrete solid catalyst particles 36.<br>
[0057] For catalytic bed process units, methods of the present invention filter<br>
particulate contaminants before they reach the catalytic bed. This allows for<br>
increased efficiency of the catalyst bed since more of the surface area of the catalyst is<br>
available for use as a catalyst when compared to systems with conventional retention<br>
materials, such as the ring grading systems used in Examples 1 and 2. As a result,<br>
smaller sized, more catalytically active catalyst elements can be used due to the lower<br>
average pressure drop of the unit resulting in a gain in catalyst activity of about 10% -<br>
15%.<br>
[0058] The reticulated material 15 may be used to filter and retain particulates 36<br>
from the outgoing process stream 38. Small particulate material 36 that may be<br>
entrained in the outlet process stream may be filtered, or captured, from the process<br>
stream 3S and retained by reticulated material layers 40, 42. Preferably, the size of<br>
the reticulated material in layers 40, 42 is graduated from a size in layer 40 to another<br>
size in layer 42 at the outlet 44 of the reactor 22. In addition, sediments of material<br>
may form in the process unit, e.g., sediments formed by excessive hydrocracking of<br>
residual oils, that may plug or foul downstream equipment. These sediments may be<br>
filtered from the outgoing process stream 38 by the reticulated material 15.<br>
Preferably, the size of the reticulated material in layers 40,42 is graduated from a size<br>
in layer 40 to another size in layer 42 at the outlet 44 of the reactor 22. Alternately,<br>
the invention may also be used in an upflow configuration wherein the contaminated<br>
process stream 46 would instead enter the unit at 44 at the lower end 39 and the outlet<br>
process stream 25 would exit the process unit at 24 at the upper end 47 of reactor 22.<br>
[0059] As previously discussed, another advantage of the present invention is to react<br>
activated or partially activated reticulated material 15 with polymer precursors in a<br>
contaminated process stream 20. Condensation polymerization of diolcfins may<br>
occur in the process unit 32 after the contaminated process stream 20 is heated,<br>
generally prior to introduction into the process unit 22, thereby forming foulants in the<br>
process unit 32 itself that may gum or plug the process unit 32. As the foulants form<br>
in the process unit, they cannot be filtered from the contaminated process stream 20<br>
before flowing across the fluid entry cross-section 34. Therefore, the layer or layers<br>
26, 28, 40, 42 of reticulated material 15 may be coated with an alumina powder that<br>
may also act as a substrate for catalyst materials to form partially activated reticulated<br>
material. As used herein, an "activated support" means (1) a reticulated material that<br>
has been impregnated with catalyst materials or (2) a reticulated material that may be<br>
an oxide, nitride, or carbide of a metal or (3) a reticulated material that contains<br>
zeolite or inorganic oxides, e.g., alumina, silica, silica-alumina, magnesia, silica-<br>
magnesia or titania. As used herein, a "partially activated support" means an activated<br>
support material that has been purposefully made less active or partially deactivated in<br>
order to achieve a slower reaction rate or to partially react the materials contacted.<br>
[0060] Coated reticulated material 15 may also be used, wherein the coating may<br>
comprise one of several conventional catalysts. Alumina may be used as an active<br>
coating, optionally but preferably, alumina may be used as a support to strengthen the<br>
catalyst. The catalyst according to this invention preferably comprises a metal of<br>
Group VI-B or a member of Group VHI, or both, impregnated into an alumina based<br>
support. Accordingly, the catalyst may comprise at least one of chromium,<br>
molybdenum and tungsten in combination with at least one of iron, nickel, cobalt,<br>
platinum, palladium and iridium. The use of palladium is particularly useful in the<br>
removal of acetylene and diolefms from ethylene, the removal of oxygen, and the<br>
removal of hydrogen. Of the Group VI-B metals, molybdenum is most preferred.<br>
The catalyst preferably will contain from about 2% to about 14% by weight of Group<br>
VI-B metal. Of the Group VTJI metals, nickel and cobalt are most preferred. The<br>
amount of Group VIII metal in the catalyst is preferably from about 0.5% to about<br>
10% by weight.<br>
[0061] With reference to FIG. 2, a multiple fixed catalyst bed process unit 46 having<br>
two fixed catalyst beds 48, 50 with reticulated material 15 in the shape of saddles 126<br>
(FIG. 7) will be described. The reactor 46 is illustrated in a downflow configuration,<br>
wherein the contaminated process stream 51 will enter the unit 46 at the inlet 52 and<br>
the outlet process stream 54 will exit the unit at the outlets 56, 60. A partially reacted<br>
process stream 58 may be accumulated at the outlet 61 of the first fixed bed 48 and<br>
withdrawn at the collector tray 60. The partially reacted process stream 58 may be<br>
heated or quenched or otherwise treated before reintroduction into the reactor 46 as a<br>
partially reacted process stream 62 at the mixing chamber 64. The partially reacted<br>
process stream 58 may be removed for redistribution, heating, or other processing<br>
steps as required before reintroducing the partially reacted process stream 62 into the<br>
reactor 46 for reaction with a succeeding catalyst bed 50. An additional layer 70 of<br>
reticulated material 15 may be provided for filtration and distribution to remove any<br>
contaminants entrained from or formed by the processing equipment used in the<br>
additional processing steps such as dirt, iron oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke<br>
fines, soot, catalyst fines, sediments or other entrained foreign particulate matter, salts<br>
in distillation columns, particulates in gas streams, sulfur or sulfides from tail gas<br>
units, or polymer precursors such as diolefins.<br>
[0062] Layers 66, 68, 70 of reticulated material 15 are provided in the reactor 46<br>
below the inlet 52 and mixing chamber 64 in an amount sufficient to filter the process<br>
stream 51 and the partially reacted process stream 62. Preferably, the multiple layers<br>
66, 68, 70 are provided such that the porosity of the reticulated material 15 is<br>
graduated from a porosity in layer 66 to another porosity in layer 68 to another<br>
porosity in layer 70 as the incoming contaminated process stream flows through the<br>
reticulated material 15. Optionally, the present invention may be practiced with or<br>
without conventional basket screens 72. Preferably, the fixed catalyst beds 48, 50<br>
contain discrete solid catalyst particles 74.<br>
[0063] Another feature of the present invention advantageously provides providing a<br>
plurality of reticulated elements 15 over an entire length of a process unit. The<br>
plurality of reticulated elements 15 can be commingled throughout the process unit<br>
with a catalyst 19, as shown in FIG. 22.<br>
[0064] As previously discussed, an advantage of the present invention is that it may<br>
also be used to distribute the process stream. The process stream 51 may also be<br>
distributed while being filtered by subdividing the incoming process stream into a<br>
plurality of smaller fluid streams by passing the process stream through a plurality of<br>
flow passageways 120 (FIG. 9) defined by the web members 123 (FIG. 9) of the<br>
reticulated material 15; then resubdividing, a plurality of times, the smaller streams so<br>
that the incoming process stream is spread uniformly across the fluid entry cross-<br>
section of the catalyst bed 76. The feed 51 is then reacted in the catalyst bed 48,<br>
before being withdrawn as a partially reacted process stream 58 at the collector plate<br>
60. The method of filtration and distribution is then repeated for the partially reacted<br>
process stream 62 as it flows into the mixing chamber 64 and passes through the<br>
reticulated material layer 70.<br>
[0065] Another feature of the present invention is that the reticulated material 15 may<br>
also be used to capture and retain catalyst particles 74 from the outflowing partially<br>
reacted process stream 58 and the reacted process stream 54. The reticulated material<br>
126 in layers 78, 80 at the outlet 61 of the first fixed bed 48 and the reticulated<br>
material 126 in layers 82, 84 at the outlet 56 of the second fixed bed 50 are used to<br>
filter and retain catalyst particles 74 that may be entrained in the partially reacted<br>
process stream 58 or reacted process stream 54. As discussed with reference to FIG.<br>
1, for capturing and retaining catalyst 74 from a partially reacted or a reacted<br>
outflowing process stream in either a single or a multiple fixed bed chemical reactor,<br>
the reticulated material 15 is preferably graduated from a porosity to another porosity<br>
as shown in FIG. 2 for layers 78, 80 and 82, 84, respectively for each bed 48, 50.<br>
Optionally, the porosity of the reticulated material may also be graduated from small<br>
pores to large pores. Alternatively, the porosity of the reticulated material may be<br>
inversely graduated from large pores to small pores to filter sediments that may form<br>
in the catalyst bed.<br>
[0066] A further advantage of the present invention is that the reticulated material 15<br>
may be activated of impregnated with catalytically active material to react with<br>
polymer precursors in process streams 51, 62. As depicted in FIG. 2, layers 66,68, 70<br>
of reticulated material 15 may contain an activated support including inorganic oxides<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, silica-alumina,<br>
magnesia, silica-magnesia or titania or zeolites preferably selected from me group<br>
consisting of zeolite L, zeolite X, and zeolite Y, which may be added to the reticulated<br>
material as a substrate for catalyst materials. Optionally, the reticulated material may<br>
be impregnated with catalyst materials or the reticulated material may be an oxide,<br>
nitride, carbide or boride of a metal as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,399,535, which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference to the extent it is not inconsistent with the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0067] Activated or partially activated reticulated material as described above may be<br>
used to control the hydrogenation rate of the diolefms or other polymer precursors to<br>
prevent fouling or gum formation. When endothermic reactions require the addition<br>
of heat to the partially reacted process stream 58, preferably the reticulated material<br>
15 of layer 70 is also activated or partially activated. The invention may also be<br>
practiced with coated reticulated material, wherein the coating may comprise one of<br>
several conventional catalysts. Alumina may be used on an active coating or support.<br>
The catalyst according to this invention preferably comprises a metal of Group VI-B<br>
or a member of Group VTR, or both, impregnated into the reticulated material,<br>
inorganic oxide or zeolite. Accordingly, the catalyst may comprise at least one of<br>
chromium, molybdenum and tungsten in combination with at least one of iron, nickel,<br>
cobalt, platinum, palladium and iridium. Of the Group VI-B metals, molybdenum is<br>
most preferred. The catalyst preferably will contain from about 2% to about 14% by<br>
weight of Group VI-B metal. Of the Group VIII metals, nickel and cobalt are most<br>
preferred. The amount of Group VEQ metal in the catalyst is preferably from about<br>
0.5% to about 10% by weight.<br>
[0068] FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional combustor-style fluidized bed reactor 88, 90.<br>
Layers 86, 92 of reticulated material 15 may be used in fluidized bed chemical<br>
reactors 90 and in a combustor, or regenerator 88, to reduce entrance losses and<br>
maldistribution of the vapor or air flows. The inlet air 94 to the combustor or<br>
regenerator 88 is flowed through the reticulated material layer 86 to subdivide the<br>
stream into a plurality of smaller flowing streams. The reticulated material 15 may be<br>
a single circular disk 124 (FIG. 6) without the illustrated perforation 125; however it<br>
may be an oval or square sheet 121 (FIG. 9), or any geometric configuration desired<br>
including an assembled disk 134 (FIG. 10). Optionally, multiple disks 86, 92 (FIG. 3)<br>
may be used. Also, the disk 124 (FIG. 7) or sheet 121 (FIG. 9) may optionally<br>
contain perforations. The subdivision of the vapor or air flows may reduce the<br>
turbulence of the incoming vapor or air streams, thus reducing the compressor<br>
horsepower usage or allowing for an increase in flow rate, depending on the process<br>
constraints of the particular combustor-style fluidized bed reactor (FIG. 3). A further<br>
advantage of the present invention is that the subdivided vapor or air flows may more<br>
uniformly distribute the vapor or air 94 throughout the combustor or regenerator 88.<br>
In addition, another layer 92 of reticulated material 15 may be used to uniformly<br>
distribute any fluffing vapors 96 used in the fluidized bed reactor 90.<br>
[0069] Alternatively, in FIG. 4, which depicts a conventional two-stage regenerator<br>
fluidized bed reactor 104, layers 98, 112 of the reticulated material 15 may be used<br>
similarly as discussed in FIG. 3 for a single-stage combustor or regenerator. The<br>
turbulent inlet air 102 to the combustor or regenerator first stage 108 is flowed<br>
through the layer 98 of reticulated material 15 to subdivide the stream, preferably into<br>
a plurality of smaller flowing streams. Preferably, the reticulated material 15 is a<br>
single circular disk 124 (FIG. 6) without the perforations 125; however it may be an<br>
oval or square sheet 121 (FIG. 9), or any geometric configuration desired including an<br>
assembled disk 134 (FIG. 10). Optionally, multiple disks 98,112 (FIG. 4) may be<br>
used. Also, the disk 124 (FIG. 7) or sheet 121 (FIG. 9) may optionally contain<br>
perforations. Similarly, for the second-stage 110, the turbulent inlet air 106 may be<br>
flowed through the layer 100 of reticulated material 15 to subdivide the stream into a<br>
plurality of smaller flowing streams. The subdivision of the vapor or air flows may<br>
reduce the turbulence of the incoming vapor or air streams, thus reducing the<br>
compressor horsepower usage or allowing for an increase in flow rate, depending on<br>
the process constraints of the two-stage regenerator fluidized bed reactor 104, 116. A<br>
further advantage of the present invention is that the subdivided vapor or air flows<br>
may more uniformly distribute the vapor or air throughout the combustor or<br>
regenerator chambers 108, 110. In addition, another layer of reticulated elementsl 12<br>
may be used to uniformly distribute any fluffing vapors 114 used in the fluidized bed<br>
reactor 116.<br>
[0070] With reference to FIG. 5, for treatment of a contaminated process stream in<br>
vapor form, a radial flow fixed bed chemical reactor 94 with reticulated material 15 in<br>
the shape of substantially spherical balls 122 (FIG. 11) is illustrated, although, as<br>
previously discussed, other shapes may be used. The contaminated process stream in<br>
vapor form 92 will enter the radial flow reactor 94 at the inlet 96. A layer 98 of<br>
reticulated material 15, more preferably layers 98, 100 of reticulated material 15, is<br>
provided in the vessel between the deflection baffle 102 and the scallop 104. The<br>
layers of 98, 100 reticulated material 15 aid in filtering contaminants such as dirt, iron<br>
oxide, iron sulfide, asphaltenes, coke fines, soot, catalyst fines, sediments or other<br>
entrained foreign particulate matter, or polymer precursors such as diolefins entrained<br>
in the contaminated vapor feed 92 before reaction in the fixed catalyst bed 108 and<br>
discharge through the center pipe 110 as the reacted process stream 112. Also as<br>
previously discussed, an advantage of the present invention is that the reticulated<br>
material 15 may be used to capture and retain catalyst from outlet streams, shown<br>
here in the unloading tubes 106.<br>
[0071] The reticulated elements can be used to filter contaminants, such as sediments,<br>
in other types of process equipment. FIG. 15 illustrates another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, reticulated elements 95 are used for removing<br>
sediments, such as salts, in a distillation column 90. The method of filtering<br>
sediments formed in process equipment preferably includes providing a layer of<br>
reticulated elements packed with a void space between each reticulated element. The<br>
void space is varied to enhance filtration of smaller contaminants on a surface of the<br>
reticulated elements while allowing larger contaminants to pass through to prevent<br>
pluggage of the layer of reticulated elements. The method further provides for<br>
contacting a process stream containing the sediments with the reticulated elements<br>
thereby removing the sediments from the process stream by removing the smaller<br>
contaminants on the surface of the reticulated elements and allowing the larger<br>
contaminants to proceed through the void spaces between each reticulated element.<br>
This method produces a relatively sediment-free process stream for further<br>
processing.<br>
[0072] FIG. 6 illustrates a specific embodiment of the present invention as a<br>
reticulated elements disk 124. Optionally, the disks may have perforations 125.<br>
Preferably^ multiple perforations are used to accommodate screen baskets that may<br>
optionally be filled with reticulated elements. Other shapes may include saddles 126<br>
(FIG. 7), hollow cylinders 128 (FIG. 8), single sheets 121 of reticulated material 15<br>
(FIG. 9), disks 134 formed from a plurality of segments 134 a-f (FIG. 10),<br>
substantially spherical balls 122 (FIG. 11), solid cylinders 132 (FIG. 12), raschig rings<br>
130 (FIG. 13), squares (FIG. 14), and monoliths (FIG. 14). Each shape may be sized<br>
to individual specifications. Sizes for the shapes used may include substantially<br>
spherical balls of about Vt to 2 inch diameters; raschig rings with inside diameters of<br>
about Vt to 1 inch and outside diameters of about lA to 1 1/2 inches and heights of<br>
about 'A to 2 inches; saddle shapes with radii of about 'A to 2 inches; hollow cylinders<br>
having inside diameteis of about % to VA inches, outside diameters of about lA to 2<br>
inches, and heights of about lA to 3 inches; and solid cylinders having diameters of<br>
about Vs to 1 inch and heights of about lA to 2 inches. Custom-made one-piece disks<br>
124 or single sheet 121 construction may be custom-fit to the physical configuration<br>
of a reactor. A further feature of this aspect of the present invention is that the<br>
reticulated material 15 may be formed in either a disk 124 or single sheet 121 having<br>
perforations 125. An additional feature of the present invention is that the reticulated<br>
elements when constructed may be formed into a plurality of segments in order to<br>
form an assembled sheet or disk that is custom-fit to the reactor's physical<br>
configuration. Porosities of the reticulated elements may range from 4 to 800 ppi.<br>
Preferably, the porosity may range from about 4 to 80 ppi. More preferably, the<br>
porosity may range from about 10 to 60 ppi. This enables customization of the size<br>
and shape of the reticulated material 15 for the application, size, particulate loading<br>
and pressure drop constraints. The reticulate element material surrounding the pores,<br>
or openings, of the reticulated elements form the web members 123 (FIG. 9), which in<br>
turn define the flow passageways 120 (FIG. 9).<br>
[0073] The present invention also advantageously provides a method of perpendicular<br>
flow distribution in process units. This perpendicular flow distribution method<br>
includes providing one or more reticulated elements in the process unit When only<br>
one reticulated element is used, it is typically large enough to effectively span the<br>
process unit. When multiple reticulated elements are used, they are typically arranged<br>
in a randomly packed bed. Regardless of the configuration of the reticulated<br>
elements, each reticulated element has a plurality of web members that define a<br>
plurality of flow passageways through the reticulated element. A process stream<br>
contacted with the plurality of reticulated elements is therefore subdivided into a<br>
plurality of smaller fluid streams by passing the process stream through the plurality<br>
of flow passageways defined by the web members of each reticulated element. The<br>
flows of the process stream through the flow passageways within the reticulated<br>
elements and through the void spaces between the reticulated elements when multiple<br>
reticulated elements are used provides for effective flow distribution perpendicular to<br>
the flow of the process stream through the process unit. This method can be applied<br>
to process streams that are entering the process unit, at any location within the process<br>
unit, at the exit from the process unit or any combination of these locations, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 19. This method can be applied to process streams while<br>
concurrently providing for filtration of contaminants from the process stream. This<br>
method can be applied to process streams while concurrently performing catalytic<br>
reactions to partially or totally remove or convert desired chemical species in the<br>
process stream.<br>
(0074 J FIG. 21 illustrates the amount of perpendicular flow that the reticulated<br>
elements of the present invention are capable of producing. An experiment was<br>
performed using a dropper with a dropper diameter of approximately 1/16". The<br>
reticulated element distributed the liquid perpendicularly to a diameter of about seven<br>
times the diameter of the dropper. The flow was not distributed down the reticulated<br>
element as much. The significant distribution was made in the horizontal plane and<br>
not a vertical plane. When used in process units, the reticulated elements significantly<br>
perpendicularly disperses the fluid to prevent channeling and other problems<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0075] An additional feature of the present invention can include the step of using<br>
reticulated elements in a variety of porosities and pore sizes, as shown in FIG. 20.<br>
The reticulated elements can be manufactured such that they have a porosity of so<br>
many pores per inch ("ppi"). For example, this means that a reticulated element of 30<br>
ppi will, when examined by one skilled in the art, have on average 30 pores per inch.<br>
The pore sizes of such a material would be just under one millimeter. Pore size in this<br>
context is the general size of the cavity of the pore recognizing that pores are not<br>
perfect spheres. Another important element of pore size is the size of the window<br>
opening into the pore. It is this measure that determines the size of the largest particle<br>
that be trapped or filtered within the pore. The porosity range of the reticulated<br>
elements of the present invention are from 4 to 800 ppi. This enables customization<br>
of the size and shape of the reticulated elements for the application constraints<br>
including particulate loading and pressure drop constraints. The pores of the<br>
reticulated elements can be in a range of about 6 millimeters to about 100 microns,<br>
each being defined by a plurality of web members forming a plurality of flow<br>
passageways through the reticulated elements.<br>
[0076] As an advantage of the present invention, the filtering method provides for<br>
more efficient filtration within the process unit. Since the contaminants do not cake<br>
up on the first inches of the reticulated elements, as with conventional retention<br>
materials, all of the filter bed can be effectively used. Pressure drop through the<br>
reticulated elements can remain low as long as sufficient reticulated elements are<br>
utilized such that the process unit reaches an end-of-run condition other than pressure<br>
drop increase. The lower pressure drop increases the safety of operating the unit since<br>
downstream equipment is not deprived of flow and the upstream equipment does not<br>
pressure up. The run times between catalyst changes are significantly increased since<br>
the process equipment can operate much longer than with previous filtration methods<br>
before the process equipment end-of-run conditions.<br>
[0077] Another advantage of the present invention is that smaller sized catalysts can<br>
be used in catalyst bed process units since the catalyst bed is subjected to a much<br>
lower cycle-average pressure drop. The result of using the smaller, more catalytically<br>
reactive catalyst is a gain in activity of about 10% to about 15%. The entire surface<br>
area of the catalyst can be used for its intended purpose, which is to modify and<br>
increase the rate of a reaction, due to a much lower average pressure drop per cycle<br>
for the process unit.<br>
[0078] Another advantage of the present invention is, as depicted in FIG 21, the use<br>
of one or more layers of reticulated elements at various locations within a process unit<br>
to facilitate perpendicular flow redistribution to mitigate channeling and other<br>
symptoms of flow maldistribution. Such one or more layers of reticulated elements<br>
within a process unit also facilitate filtration of particulate contaminants within the<br>
process unit.<br>
[0079] It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the exact details<br>
of construction, operation, exact materials, or embodiments shown and described, as<br>
obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For<br>
example, special liquid distributors or conventional liquid distributors could be used<br>
the reticulated elements to facilitate the spreading of the liquid across process<br>
equipment. Conversely, the reticulated elements could be used only for particulate<br>
removal. Accordingly, the invention is therefore to be limited only by the scope of<br>
the appended claims.<br>
