				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a lactate biosensing strip for the measurement of lactate solution. The present invention also relates to a method for the manufacture of a novel lactate biosensing strip and to the use thereof for lactate sensing.<br>
Physicians rely on personal examination and clinical laboratory results to determine the presence and concentration of biological analytes in critical care patients. Clinical laboratories offer a wide range of automated systems for high-volume testing and analytical support in a well controlled, high quality environment. However, clinical laboratories can not provide the immediate results needed to properly treat trauma and multi organ dysfunction/failure patients.<br>
To meet the clinical need for immediate test results, several technologies are emerging for testing using reliable, automated analyzers at the patient's bedside including electrochemical biosensors, optical fluorescence sensors, paramagnetic particles for coagulation test systems, and micromachined devices for both chemical and immunochemical testing. These technologies have allowed multi-analyte chemistry panels to be performed rapidly and have addressed previous obstacles such as calibration of test devices.<br>
These tests can be classified as: 1) in vitro, which is performed at the bedside; 2) ex vivo or para vivo, which is performed at wrist-side; and 3) in vivo, which is performed inside the patient. Such tests offer indirect cost efficiencies and savings such as reduced labor costs, decreased blood identification and transport errors, and reduced patient complications.<br>
In vitro or bedside devices are used typically in several departments of the hospital including intensive care units; operating rooms; emergency departments (ER); interventional departments; general patient care departments; and outpatient surgery and ambulatory care units. In vitro diagnostic tests offer a wide range of diagnostic tests, similar to the clinical laboratory. In vitro diagnostic test systems typically are not connected on-line to the patient and require an operator for blood sampling.<br>
Key categories of diagnostic test in the diagnostic market include arterial blood gases, blood chemistries, blood glucose, coagulation, drugs-of-abuse testing, hemoglobin, hematocrit, infectious diseases, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Other categories include cancer markers, cardiac markers, cholesterol detection, immunodiagnostics, infectious disease detection, lactate, and thrombolytic monitoring.<br>
Ex vivo diagnostics use external sensors for on-line real-time testing with little to no blood loss. Typically, sampled blood flows through a closed system to minimize blood contact. Ex vivo systems minimize problems associated with in vivo sensors, including<br><br>
In vivo diagnostics offer considerable potential in the treatment of most critical and<br>
unstable patients. Although many companies are developing in vivo sensors, technical<br>
hurdles have thus far kept in vivo sensors from common commercial use.<br>
Ex vivo and in vivo diagnostics, since they are on-line systems, can reduce quality<br>
control ami information integration errors that occur with clinical or in vitro tests. Quality<br>
control errors are commonly due to operator errors, not instrument errors or device failures.<br>
Exemplary errors include inappropriate specimen volume, inaccurate calibration, use of<br>
deteriorated test strips, inadequate validation, insufficient instrument maintenance, bad timing<br>
of the test procedure, and use of the wrong materials. Clinical information system integration<br>
allows test data collected at the bedside to be put directly into the patient record. This<br>
improves the efficiency of the patient management process, allowing the integration of the<br>
laboratory's information system and clinical information systems, providing a "seamless"<br>
flow of all types of patient information..<br>
Lactate is the byproduct of carbohydrate metabolism and product of glycolysis<br>
(pyrovate) is converted into lactate under an aerobic condition i.e. deficiency of oxygen in<br>
cells. Lactate estimations are therefore important in respiratory disorder, heart ailment, labor<br>
deseases etc. normal concentration of lactate in human blood is in the range of 1.2 to 2.7mM.<br>
Procedure for lactate determination for example, has employed a variety of chemical<br>
and physical technique. Traditional assay involves chemical treatment of lactate in human<br>
blood and thereby converting it into colour products which can be measured<br>
spectrophotometrically, the methods consists in reacting the blood under test with enzyme<br>
namely lactate dehydrogenise (LDH). In such process absorbance at 340nm is measured due<br>
to the NADH formation, it becomes a measurement of lactate originally present in blood.<br>
US Patent 6,117,290 discloses an on-line lactate sensor arrangement. The sensor<br>
arrangement includes a lactate sensor, a catheter for withdrawing a test sample, and a first<br>
fluid flow line provided fluid communication between the lactate sensor and the catheter. The<br>
sensor arrangement also includes a source of sensor calibration and.anticoagulant solution,<br>
and second fluid flow line providing fluid communication between the source of sensor<br>
calibration and anticoagulant solution and the lactate sensor.<br>
In practice there are some difficulties in adopting such a detection procedure for use<br>
with blood sample. The disadvantage of such methods, include, lack of specificity, difficulty<br>
of standardization, requirement of large amount of blood and use of unstable and corrosive<br>
regents. Such methods also involve optical detection and are therefore expensive and time<br>
consuming. Additionally, the samples must be prepared. Another disadvantage is that the<br>
measurement of lactate level by prior art methods need to be done in laboratory by qualified<br>
personnel.<br>
Asha Chaubey et al disclose in Electrochimica Acta Vol 46, 723 - 729 (2000) the<br>
immobilization of lactate dehydrogenase on electrochemically prepared polypyrrole<br>
polyvinyl sulphonate composite films. The response time reported is about 40 seconds and a<br>
shelf life of about 2 weeks under refrigerated conditions. In another disclosure (Asha<br>
Chaubey et al, Analyticla Chimica Acta Vol 49, 98 - 103, 2000), the immobilization of<br>
lactate dehydrogenase on conducting polyaniline films is disclosed. The linearity of response<br>
is shown from 0.1 mM to ImM lactate concentration with a shelf life of about 3 weeks under<br>
refrigerated conditions. It is preferable to obtain sensors with longer shelf life and shorter<br>
response time.<br>
Accordingly, it is important to provide a lactate biosensing strip that can overcome the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art without losing out on efficiency and accuracy of measurement.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a novel lactate biosensing strip for the<br>
measurement of lactate in aqueous medium.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a lactate biosensing strip which<br>
performs rapidly and accurately the estimation of lactate in an aqueous medium.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a lactate biosensing strip which is<br>
low cost and is capable of being used by even non-medical persons.<br>
A further object of this invention is an assay, which can be performed without the<br>
need for elaborate preliminary treatment of blood sample.<br>
Another object of this invention is to proposed a lactate biosensing strip, which has a<br>
high activity of 75%.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to proposed a lactate-sensing strip, which is<br>
capable for providing a reading at site.<br>
Lactate biosensing strip have many advantages over traditional methods, such as fast<br>
response, small size convenience, specificity of response, lack of need of any sample<br>
preparation, low cost and high sensitivity of measurement. The main advantage of this sensor<br>
over the traditional method is sample operation it can be done by ordinary person.<br>

The shelf life of the strip of the invention is about 4 months under refrigerated conditions. Under ambient conditions (25 to 30°C) the shelf life of the biosensing strip is seen to be about 2 months. The strip of the invention is disposable.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>

Figure 2 is the response curve of the lactate biosensing strip of the invention for standard lactate test samples.<br>
Figure 3 shows the calibration curve for the sensor against standard lactate test samples prepared in a laboratory.<br>
Figure 4 shows the shelf life stability characteristics of the lactate strip of the invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As shown in figure 1, the invention comprises an electrically insulated base support (1) for supporting an electrode assembly (2), (3), (4) and (5). The electrode assembly comprises two electrode systems, a working electrode system (2), (3) and (5) consisting of a silver layer with<br><br>
a graphite layer deposited thereon and an enzyme and mediator layer adsorbed in the inorganic matrix. The other electrode assembly comprises a reference electrode comprising a silver layer partly deposited with a graphite layer and a silver/silver chloride layer thereon. Figure 1 shows the PVC sheet (i) which comprises the supporting substrate for the electrode. Conducting silver tracking (ii) is the screen-printed conducting graphite layer onto the surface of conducting silver tracking (iii) for the connection of the sensor to read out apparatus. The target area consists of the working electrode (iv) and the reference electrode (v) applies to the end of tracking by screen-printing. An insulated layer is applied over the printed electrode to give them protection; the mass can be coated with one or more legends. The conducting graphite track (ii) does not extend to the complete length of the silver track and the reference electrode.<br>
To achieve calibration of the biosensing strip, the strip was used to detect currents when the lactate solutions were used in concentrations of 1 to 8mM. The current measured for each of the concentrations was measured and plotted in Figure 2. In Figure 2, curve (1) is the response curve for 1mM lactate solution, curve (2) is for 2mM solution, curve (3) is for 4mM solution, curve (4) is for 6mM solution and curve (5) is for 8mM solution. This shows that the biosensing strip of the invention can be used to measure lactate in a blood sample if the range lies in the region of 1 to 8 mM in a subject. The sensitivity of the system in terms of the response time to attain a stable current value was determined by analyzing the strip time variation of current. This comprised initiating current measurement from the time fo putting the drop of standard test solution on the strip to the time when the current asymptotically reaches a stable value. It was observed (Figure 3) that the current attains the stable value in 30 to 40 seconds.<br>
Shelf life characteristics were determined by measuring the current due to a known lactate concentration on strips stored for different periods of time. The data is given in Figure 4. In Figure 4, curve (1) is for strips stored under refrigerated conditions (at 4°C) while curve (2) is for strips stored at 25 - 30°C.<br>
The invention provides a lactate sensor strip which comprise in forming a first and second electrode on a substrate by applying a layer of silver for each of said electrodes in said electrode, applying a layer graphite on the handling zone of said second electrode to silver chloride, applying a mediator and enzyme on the graphite layer of the working zone of the first electrode. An outer hydrophilic membrane is applied zone of said first electrode. The silver layers and the graphite layers are preferably applied by the step of screen-printing.<br><br>
The main feature of this invention is that the sensor is a dry strip sensor. It is found<br>
that a similar mix of reagents employed in a wet sensor system did not give good result<br>
across a desired range of detectable lactate concentration.<br>
This invention comprises a substrate for supporting an electrode assembly said<br>
electrode assembly comprising two electrode systems, one working electrode and another one<br>
as a reference electrode supported on said substrate and disposed in a spaced relationship to<br>
each other. The lactate sensing strip comprising of a substrate for supporting a first or<br>
working electrode and second or reference electrode, said electrode disposed in a spaced<br>
relationship to each other.<br>
The first electrode is a working electrode and has a terminal extending in to a working<br>
zone through a handling zone. The second electrode is a reference electrode and has a<br>
terminal extending in to a working zone through a handling zone. In both cases, the<br>
respective terminals are of a material different to the base conducting layer of said first and<br>
second electrodes.<br>
Commercially obtained lactate oxidase is mixed in a phosphate buffer, then proper<br>
amount of this solution is injected onto a preprinted working electrode. This solution is<br>
allowed to dry in allow temperature, followed by<br>
i. printing of conducting tracking<br>
ii. printing of reference electrode<br>
i i i. printing o f working e lectrode<br>
iv. fixing of membrane onto electrode.<br>
The working and reference electrode each comprise a base conducting layer of silver<br>
material along the handling and working zone. A graphite layer is deposited on the silver<br>
layer of the working electrode and extends to the terminal; the graphite layer is applied on the<br>
handling zone of the reference electrode and extends to the terminal. Ag/AgCl is deposited on<br>
the target area of the reference electrode. Working electrode comprising conducting surface<br>
carrying mediator compound and lactate oxidase enzyme. Mediator compound transfer<br>
electrodes from the enzyme to the electrode, when such catalytic activity takes place. A<br>
hydrophilic membrane must be provided on the working zone of said electrode. It appears<br>
that the surfactant serves to break up the lipoprotein complex of blood and lactate is then<br>
oxidized to the pyruvate by the lactate oxidase. The mediator compound is electrochemically<br>
reduced at the electrode producing a current measurable at the electrode, which current is<br>
relative to the activity of the lactate oxidize and hence the amount of lactate present in the<br>
sample this current is generated through a serious of coupled reactions<br>
L-Lactate+LOD (0x) Pyruvate +LOD (red)<br>
LOD (rwn+Me (ox) LOD (ox)+ Me (re)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The redox mediator is oxidized at the base electrode and the current proportional to the lactate concentration. The current can be measured by any conventional electronic system.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not constitute to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Preparation of graphite paste with mediator<br>
l00mg of graphite powder and polyvinyl pyrrolidon (binder) was mixed with 0.01M Potassium ferricyanide (mediator) in ethylene glycol monobutyl ether to prepare screen printable working electrode graphite paste. Example 2 Preparation of Dry strip<br>
Commercially obtained lactate oxidase solution (2µL) containing 2U of lactate oxidase was physically adsorbed on the mediator mixed graphite electrode strip and was kept over night to dry at 25°C. The dry strip electrode was covered with a hydrophilic nylon membrane. Before the membrane was applied, it was placed in 10% surfactant (Tween 80) solution in distilled water for some time the dried membrane was then fixed over the strip. Example 3 Preparation of lactate standard lactate solutions<br>
Stock lactate solution 10 mM was prepared in 0.1M phosphate buffer. Standard solutions of 2 mM, 4 mM, 6 mM and 8 mM were prepared by diluting the stock solution with phosphate buffer. Example 4 Preparation of enzyme stock solution<br>
15 mg of enzyme lactate oxidase was dissolved in l00µl of 0.1 M phosphate buffer to get the concentration 5U/µ.l to get the working enzyme solution, the stock solution was further diluted to lU/µl. Example 5 Immobilization of enzyme on the mediator mixed graphite dry strip<br>
2 µ1 of enzyme solution containing 2 U of lactate oxidase was physically adsorbed on the mediator mixed graphite electrode strip and was kept over night to dry at 25°C. The said<br><br>
dry strip electrode was covered by a hydrophilic nylon membrane. Before applying the membrane, it was placed in 10% surfactant (Tween 80) solution in distilled water for some time and then dried membrane was fixed over the strip. Example 6 Enzyme activity<br>
Sigma protocol for activity of lactate oxidase was used to estimate the lactate oxidase activity. The basic principle is that lactate oxidase converts 1-lactate to pyruvate and H2O2. H2O2 is subsequently converted into a colored dye by peroxidase in the presence of 4-amino antipyrine (4AAP) and dimethylaniline(DMA).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the optimum conditions of temperature= 37°C and pH = 6.5, the dye absorbs at 565 run at the light path of 1cm. The activity of the immobilized enzyme was calculated according to the following formula:<br>
Ucm-2 =   AV/εts Where A is the change in absorbance before and after incubation<br>
V is the total volume (3 ml)<br>
ε is the milimolar extinction coefficient of Quinonediimine dye at 565 nm (35.33)<br>
t is the reaction time (10 min)<br>
s is the surface area of the enzyme electrode The enzyme activity of immobilized LOD on the working graphite strip was found to be75%. Example7 Amperometric Response Studies<br>
The lactate biosensing strip comprising enzyme(LOD) immobilized on graphite as working electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode is connected to the input of the electrometer was polarized at a bias voltage of 0.4V for the measurement of amperometric calibration response to lactate (1-8 mM)(Figure 2). A maximum current of 60 µA was obtained for 8 mM lactate solution above which no significant change in current could be observed. The response time for lactate solution (1-8 mM) was found to be 40 seconds for each concentration of lactate (Figure 3). Results were found to be reproducible to within 5%. Following principle was involved in the amperometric measutrements.<br><br>
