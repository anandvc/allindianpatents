Process for locating a medical instrument with a microcoil<br>
The invention relates to an MR process to locate a medical instrument with a microcoil attached thereto in the examination volume of an MR device.<br>
The invention also relates to an MR device for performance of such a process and a computer program to implement such a process on an MR device.<br>
In the field of interventional radiology, processes based on magnetic resonance (MR) are now becoming increasingly important. In contrast to radio diagnostics previously generally used in this field, magnetic resonance has the advantage that neither the patient nor the doctor performing the work is exposed to ionizing radiation. Also MR processes have the advantage of far better soft tissue contrast than processes of radio diagnostics.<br>
For interventional radiological processes, the location of the interventional medical instruments used always plays a decisive role. These instruments can be for example be intravascular catheters, biopsy needles, minimal invasive surgical instruments or similar. One important use of interventional radiology is angiography i.e. radiological processes to clarify the anatomical details of a patient's blood system. Angiographic MR processes are of particular interest for examining blood vessels by means of intravascular catheters which at their tips are equipped with special microcoils for the purposes of location.<br>
US 6 236 205 Bl discloses an MR-based process to locate a medical instrument with attached microcoil. In the previously known process, the microcoil is used as part of a resonant circuit which is tuned to the resonant frequency of the MR device used. The resonant circuit is influenced according to the previously known process via an optical control signal which is supplied to the resonant circuit via an optical fiber. In the previously known process first in the usual manner in the entire examination volume of the MR device a high frequency excitation is performed by means of one or more high frequency pulses. The high frequency radiation couples into the microcoil so that the resonant circuit is excited to resonance. The excited resonant circuit then in turn emits a high frequency signal which in the local environment of the microcoil amplifies the field intensity of the high frequency pulse. By temporal variation of the optical control signal supplied to the resonant circuit,<br><br>
according to the previously known process the resonant circuit is switched on and off alternately by means of an optically controllable impedance. As a result the high frequency signal emitted by the microcoil also varies temporally according to the control signal. As a result the components of the received MR signal arising from the local environment of the microcoil can be distinguished from the signal components arising from the other areas of the examination volume. In this way it is possible according to the previously known process to identify the microcoil in the MR images reconstructed from the recorded MR signals and hence determine the position of the medical instrument.<br>
The disadvantage in the previously known process is that it requires a special hardware, namely the opto-electronics described above, to control the resonant circuit. Furthermore special signal processing and signal generation components are required which must be controllable by the central control unit of the MR device. Examples are a suitable light source and a modulator to modulate the light of the light source which is coupled into the optical fiber of the medical instrument. It is necessary for the modulator to be controllable by the central control unit of the MR device so that the temporal development of the inputted light signal can be controlled in synchrony with the generation of the high frequency pulse and the recording of the MR signal. These components do not form part of the standard equipment of MR devices normally present in clinical use. To be able to operate such devices according to the previously known MR process therefore - disadvantageous^ - not insignificant investment is required to adapt the hardware and software.<br>
On this basis the object of the invention is to develop an MR process which allows particularly simple location of a medical instrument equipped with a microcoil without the hardware of the MR device used requiring any special adaptation.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention as claimed in Claim 1 by an MR process to locate in the examination volume of an MR device a medical instrument with attached microcoil which is part of a resonant circuit tuned to the resonant frequency of the MR device and having no external controls, where at least two temporally successive high frequency pulses are generated within the examination volume and where frequency-coded MR signals are recorded after each of the high frequency pulses from the examination volume. The position of the medical instrument is determined according to the invention by analyzing differences between the MR signals recorded.<br><br>
It is known that in MR processes, generating two or more temporally successive high frequency pulses causes the core magnetization within the examination volume to try to reach a steady state. In the steady state, the generation of transverse core magnetization by the high frequency pulse and the relaxation of core magnetization are balanced. The steady state is usually only achieved after irradiation of several high frequency pulses. In the steady state the MR signals recorded have more or less constant amplitude. Until the steady state is reached the MR signal amplitude can be subject to oscillation, where in particular the intensity of these oscillations or the speed with which the steady state is achieved depends on the rotary angles of the core magnetization allocated to the high frequency pulses. As described above, excitation of the resonant circuit by the high frequency pulses leads to an amplification of the high frequency fields in the local environment of the microcoil attached to the medical instrument. As a result the effective rotary angle of the high frequency pulses in the local environment of the microcoil is greater than in the other areas of the examination volume of the MR device. The core magnetization to a certain extent "senses" a greater rotary angle of the high frequency pulse in the vicinity of the microcoil than in the areas remote from the microcoil. The process according to the invention is based on the knowledge that the steady state of core magnetization in the areas of the examination volume remote from the microcoil is achieved in a different way to that in the immediate local environment of the microcoil. According to the invention, frequency- coded MR signals from the examination volume are recorded after each of the high frequency pulses. This is suitably done by means of a magnetic field gradient in a prespecified spatial direction. Because the transition to the steady state in the local environment of the microcoil is different from that in the other areas of the examination volume, according to the invention the position of the medical instrument can be determined by simple analysis of differences between the MR signals recorded.<br>
The essential advantage of the process according to the invention in relation to the prior art is that with a microcoil on a medical instrument, only one resonant circuit need be applied, where the resonant circuit must be firmly tuned to the resonant frequency of the MR device. The resonant circuit constitutes a purely passive high frequency circuit which has no any external controls. It is possible to fit to a medical instrument, for example an intravascular catheter, a suitable resonant circuit which in the simplest case comprises a microcoil and capacitor connected parallel thereto, with minimum expense and cost. It is particularly advantageous that no additional hardware components of the MR device used are<br><br>
required. The MR process according to the invention can simply be performed with any normal MR device in clinical use.<br>
Suitably in the process according to the invention a difference signal can be determined by subtraction of the recorded MR signals so that the position of the medical instrument can be determined from the frequency spectrum of the difference signal. The differences between the recorded MR signals can be analyzed particularly well by means of the difference signal. The position of the medical instrument arises on the basis of frequency coding of the MR signals recorded directly from the frequency spectrum of the difference signal. The frequency spectrum of the difference signal constitutes to some extent a projection image of the examination volume on the co-ordinate axis prespecified by the frequency coding direction. By use of the process according to the invention, by recording the MR signals in different frequency coding directions, the precise three-dimensional position of the medical instrument within the examination volume can be determined. In particular the movement of the medical instrument within the examination volume can also be followed in real time. The process according to the invention advantageously works extremely quickly as it is not necessary to record a complete MR signal data set to reconstruct an MR image of the entire examination volume. Advantageously the process according to the invention can be used for "slice-tracking" where the position and orientation of the image plane for an MR layer image are prespecified as a function of the position of the medical instrument determined according to the invention.<br>
Suitably in the MR process according to the invention as claimed in Claim 3, the rotary angles of the core magnetization allocated to the high frequency pulses are clearly less than 90°. As claimed in Claims 4 and 5 it is advantageously possible to select the rotary angles allocated to the high frequency pulses such that the amplitudes of the successively recorded MR signal components which are based on the excitation of core magnetization in the local environment of the microcoil attached to the medical instrument show significant differences while at the same time the amplitudes of the MR signal components recorded from the other areas of the examination volume are essentially constant. Consequently by suitable choice of the rotary angle the determination according to the invention of the position of the medical instrument can be optimized by ensuring that the amplitude of the core magnetization on transition to steady state in the local environment of the microcoil oscillates greatly while the amplitude of the core magnetization in the areas remote from the microcoil remains more or less the same. It is essential for the reliable function of the MR process according to the invention however that the rotary angles of the high frequency<br><br>
pulses are selected so that the transition of core magnetization to the steady state in the environment of the medical instrument differs from that in the other areas of the examination volume.<br>
Suitably as claimed in Claim 6, the temporal spacing between the successively generated high frequency pulses according to the invention is less than the longitudinal relaxation time of the core magnetization.<br>
To perform the MR process according to the invention an MR device as claimed in Claims 7 and 8 is suitable. On such an MR device the process described above can be implemented by means of a suitable program control of the central control unit and/or reconstruction and display unit.<br>
The process according to the invention can be made available to the users of such MR devices as claimed in Claim 9 in the form of a corresponding computer program. The computer program can be stored on suitable data carriers such as for example CD-ROM or diskette or it can be downloaded via the internet into the control unit of the MR device.<br>
The invention will be further described with reference to examples of embodiments shown in the drawings, to which however the invention is not restricted.<br>
These show:<br>
Fig. 1   sequence of high frequency pulses and switched magnetic field gradients according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2   diagram of amplitudes of the MR signals recorded according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 3   MR device according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the temporal sequence of high frequency pulses RF and switched magnetic field gradients GR for determining according to the invention the position of a medical instrument equipped with a microcoil. Allocated to the first high frequency pulse is a rotary angle α1. The magnetic field gradient GR is switched in a prespecified spatial direction after generation of the first high frequency pulse so that at time t1 a gradient echo is generated which is recorded as the MR signal S1. Immediately thereafter a second high frequency pulse is generated with rotary angle  α2  where at time t2 again a gradient echo is recorded as the MR signal S2. The temporal spacing between the two high frequency pulses is clearly less than<br><br>
the longitudinal relaxation time of the core magnetization and the rotary angles  α1, 012 are selected clearly less than 90°. From Fig. 1 it is clear that the MR signals S1 and S2 have clearly different amplitudes. By analyzing the differences between the recorded MR signals S1 and S2 according to the invention, the position of the medical instrument can be determined. The magnetic field gradient GR existing at times t1 and t2 causes a frequency coding of the recorded MR signals S1 and S2. Using the frequency coding, MR signal components based on the excitation of core magnetization in the local environment of the microcoil attached to the medical instrument can be distinguished from MR signal components based on the excitation of core magnetization in the other areas of the examination volume. According to the invention for example a difference signal can be calculated by subtracting the recorded MR signals Si and S2, where then the position of the medical instrument can be determined using the frequency spectrum of the difference signal. The frequency spectrum to a certain extent constitutes a one-dimensional projection image where the projection direction is prespecified by the direction of the magnetic field gradient GR.<br>
Fig. 2 shows as a function of time the amplitudes of the MR signal components Sµ recorded from the local environment of the microcoil and the MR signal components So recorded from the other areas of the examination volume. Because as described above in the local environment of the magnetic coil the field intensity of the high frequency pulses is amplified, for core magnetization in this area an effectively greater rotary angle is required than is the case in the other areas within the examination volume. This leads to the MR signal components Sµ recorded at times t1 and t2 having significantly different amplitudes, while the amplitudes of the MR signal components So are more or less constant. As is clear from Fig. 2, for core magnetization in the local environment of the microcoil, the transition to the steady state due to the pulse sequence shown in Fig. 1 differs from that in the areas of the examination volume remote from the microcoil. According to the invention the position of the medical instrument is determined from these differences.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an MR device according to the invention as a block diagram. The device comprises a main field coil 1 to generate a homogeneous static magnetic field in an examination volume containing a patient 2. In the patient is a medical instrument 3, namely an intravascular catheter, to which a microcoil 4 is attached. The microcoil 4 is part of a resonant circuit not shown in more detail in Fig. 3 which is tuned to the resonant frequency of the MR device. For performance of the process according to the invention the resonant circuit has no external controls. The MR device shown has furthermore gradient coils 5, 6 and 7 to<br><br>
generate magnetic field gradients in different spatial directions within the examination volume. By means of a central control unit 8 connected via a gradient amplifier 9 with the gradient coils 5, 6 and 7, the temporal development of the magnetic field gradient is controlled within the examination volume. The MR device shown further includes a high frequency coil 10 to generate high frequency fields in the examination volume and to record MR signals from the examination volume. The high frequency coil 10 is connected via a transmitter/receiver unit 11 with the central control unit 8 and with a reconstruction and display unit 12 respectively. The MR signals processed by the reconstruction and display unit 12 can be displayed by means of a screen 13. The central control unit 8 and/or the reconstruction and display unit 12 of the MR device has a programmable control by means of which the MR process described above can be implemented on any MR device.<br>
