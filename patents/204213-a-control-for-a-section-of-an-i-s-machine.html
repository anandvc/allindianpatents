THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A CONTROL FOR A SECTION OF AN I.S. MACHINE"<br>
EMHART GLASS S.A., a Swiss corporation having a place of business at Gewerbestrasse 11, CH-6330 Cham, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br><br><br>
7-1-2005<br><br>
7 JAN 2005<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
The present invention relates to a control for a section of an l.S machine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a control for a section of an l.S.(individual section) machine which produces vertically standing bottles within a blow mold formed by an opposed pair of blow molds and wherein the finish portion of a bottle formed in the blow mold has at the top thereof a lower finish portion located within the opposed molds when the opposed molds are closed and an upper finish portion located above the opposed molds when the opposed molds are closed, the section having<br>
a displaceable takeout,<br>
tongs carried by the takeout which can be displaced between open and closed positions,<br>
means for displacing the opposed blow molds between a closed position and an open position,<br>
a cycle controller for controlling a normal blow mold cycle including<br>
means for displacing said opposed blow molds to the open position whereby the lower finish will be exposed,<br>
means for displacing the takeout from a retracted position to a first position,<br>
means for displacing the tongs to the closed position when the takeout is in the first position to grip the finish at the lower finish portion, and<br>
means for displacing the takeout with a bottle gripped by the takeout at the lower finish portion from the first takeout position to the retracted takeout position, characterized by<br>
a cycle controller for controlling a preheat blow mold cycle including<br>
means for displacing the takeout, with the blow molds closed, from the retracted position to a second position vertically above said first takeout position,<br>
means for displacing the tongs to the closed position, when the takeout is at the second position, to grip the finish at the upper finish portion,<br>
means for displacing the opposed molds to the open position, and<br>
means for displacing the takeout with a bottle gripped by the takeout at the upper finish portion from the second takeout position to the retracted takeout position.<br><br><br>
An I.S. (individual section) machine has a plurality of identical sections (a section frame in which and on which are mounted a number of section mechanisms) each of which has a blank station which receives one or more gobs<br>
15 of molten glass and forms them in blankmolds into parisons having a threaded opening at the bottom (the finish) and a blow station which receives the parisons and forms them in blowmolds into bottles standing upright with the finish at the top.  An invert and neck ring holder mechanism which<br>
20 includes an opposed pair of arms, rotatable about an invert axis, carries the parisons from the blank station to the blow station inverting the parisons from a finish down to a finish up orientation in the process. A bottle formed at the blow station is removed from the section by a takeout<br>
25 . mechanism which has a pair of tongs which will grip the -finish of a formed bottle before it is released from the blow mold.<br>
Before an I.S. machine can produce good bottles, the mold equipment must be preheated.   This  is  initially<br>
30 accomplished by loading successive gobs of molten glass into the blankmolds which, until the blankmolds are heated will form defective parisons which must be removed from the blank station by an operator. When the blankmolds are heated and produce good parisons the invert mechanism will<br>
35  deliver the parisons to the blow station but the blow molds<br>
1<br><br>
will form defective bottles until the blank station becomes properly warmed up.  For example, when the parison is" not<br>
blown into a fully formed bottle, it will drop when the blow mold opens so   that the take out cannot   grip_ the finish_ and carry it out to the conveyor dead plate.  An operator must then reach with a pair of tongs and quickly remove "the" gla'ss before the next parison is transferred to the blow •moirdT  At"the same time, the operator must avoid being hit<br>
by the neck ring arms and Jthe. take out mechanis_m that continue to operate in the normal manner.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly a_n object of this invention to<br>
automat ically__^_empye	defective	bo-ttle ..from	the___blow<br>
station.<br>
Other objects and_advantages of .the present invention will become apparent from the following portion of this specification and from the accompanying drawings that illustrate in accordance with the mandate___qf___t.h.e. patent statutes a presently preferred embodiment incorporating the principles'""of the "Tnventfon .<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic showing looking from one blow mold of a open blow mold  pair    throilgh a blown bottle at<br>
the other blow mold with the tongs of a takeout mechanism gripping the bottle below the finish;<br>
Figure 2 is a flow chart illustrating a  control algorithm for the sequence of events for a normal blow mold cycle; and<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart illustrating the control<br><br><br>
algorithm for a blow mold preheat cycle; and :<br>
Figure 4 is a view similar to figure 1 with the tongs gripping the finish above the bottom of the finish.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The blow station of a section of an I.S. machine is made up of one or more opposed pairs of blow molds 10 (one shown) which are displaceable between open and closed positions. A parison 12 (shown in dotted lines in figure 1) is delivered to each blow mold when the blow mold pair is open and the blow molds are closed around the parison, below the finish 14 tq   define the  mold. In figure I the finish is schematically shown as a pair of vertically spliced rings 16 which could be separated threads on which the cap is to be screwed onto.  To blow the parison into<br>
the bottle, a baffle (not shown) is positioned on top of the closed blow molds around the finish and air under<br>
pressure is forced through the baffle into the parison to blow_it into a bottle. The baffle is than retracted away from the top of the blow mold pair (blow head off) . The blow molds are not opened until the formed bo 11 lehas   been_<br>
sufficiently cooled to be able   to stand and before the blow<br>
mold pair is opened, a take out which supports a pair of<br>
tongs 18 at its bottom, is located at  the ready  position (the dot ted line position/take put in) so that when the blow mold pair is opened (mold open) the tong. pair can be closed to grip the bottle immediately below the finish (tongs closed). The take  out , with a bottle gripped by the tongs, will be displaced to a deadplate (take out out)<br>
where the bottle will be held above the deadplate and further cooled. Following this further cooling, the tongs will be opened to release the bottle onto a deadplate where it will be engaged by a pusher which will sweep the bottle onto a conveyor.<br><br>
he control 20 (figure 2) has a selector  22  which  will<br>
determine whether the blow  mold normal cycle 23 or the blow<br>
mold preheat cycle   24  (flgure 3)     is   to   operate.    The<br>
algorithm illustrated in FIG. 2 show_s. .the operation of a<br>
normal blow mold  cycle in an I.S. machine section,,.' from the<br>
time the blow head has completed blowing the bottle- until<br>
the bottle is removed from the blow molds.  Blow head off<br>
25, take out in to Zl (26)   and take out  out--21,   tongs close<br>
28, and mold open 30 are separate timed events  (they  occur<br>
at  specific times  referenced  from the beginning of a<br>
section cycle) that are entered into the forming ,cycle as<br>
inputs.   The Jiirst timed event is blow head off 25 at<br>
T(off).  Following removal of the blow head, takeout in to<br>
Zl (26) at T(in) will result in the displacement of the<br>
takeout, with the tongs open, to the fully down location<br>
above the blow molds.   Mold open 30,  which occurs at<br>
T(open) will open the molds.  With the molds open, tongs<br>
close (28) at T (close) will result in the tongs gripping<br>
the bottle below the bottom ring of. the finish 14 at the Zl<br>
datum.   As  can be  seen' from  figure  2,  the control,<br>
following the command to displace the take out in, will<br>
verify that the takeout has in fact been located at datum<br>
Zl (Is takeout at Zl (32).  If this is  verified, at T(out), <br>
which is later than T   (clxse)  takeout out  27- wil.l raise the<br>
tongs and displace the gripped  bottle to a location over <br>
the section dead plate (not shown) .	<br>
When the control is set for the blow mold preheat cycle 24, the flow chart will be as illustrated in FIG.3. The first timed event, is blow head off 25 at T(off). Following removal of the blow head, takeout in to Z2 (26A) at T(in) will result in the displacement of the takeout, with the tongs open, to the fully down location above the blow molds. With the molds closed, tongs close (28) at T(close), which is later than T(in), will result in the tongs gripping the bottle below the upper ring of the<br><br><br><br>
finish 14 at the Z2 datum. Mold open . 30, which occurs at T(open), which is later than T (close), will then open the molds. As can be seen from figure 2, the control, following the command to displace the take out in to Z2, will  verify that the  take-'out has in fact been located at<br>
datum Z2 (Is take outsat 22 (32A).L	If this is verified,<br>
at T(out), which is later than T(open), takeout out 21  will<br>
raise the tongs and displace the gripped bottle to a' location over the section dead plate (not shown).<br><br>
