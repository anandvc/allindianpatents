				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Particles that Disrupt or Impede Bacterial Adhesion, Related Compositions and Methods<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The process of tooth decay has been the subject of intense scrutiny.<br>
Tooth decay is typically caused by a process that begins with formation of plaque, which<br>
contains acid-secreting bacteria that etch and erode the tooth surface and otherwise<br>
irritate or attack the gingival and soft dental tissue surfaces. Plaque formation begins<br>
minutes after tooth brushing or professional tooth cleaning, with bacterial attachment<br>
taking place within a few hours thereafter.<br>
[0002]       Regular, repeated plaque removal is the main route by which tooth<br>
decay is kept in abeyance, although professionally-applied, solid polymeric sealants have<br>
been utilized as replaceable protective coatings to prevent direct contact of plaque<br>
bacteria and their acids with the tooth surface. Anti-bacterial agents have also been<br>
included in dental treatment compositions both to kill oral bacteria and, in some cases, to<br>
provide a temporary residual effect against bacterial propagation in the plaque layer<br>
formed after toothbrushing with the composition.<br>
[0003]       However, it would be desirable to provide an efficient strategy to<br>
prevent or inhibit bacterial attachment to tooth and oral soft tissue surfaces, without the<br>
need to seal the tooth in a contiguous polymer layer, and without the need to involve<br>
intervention of a dental professional.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]       The invention provides particles that disrupt and/or impede the<br>
attachment of bacteria to an oral surface and compositions containing the particle. The<br>
particle includes (i) a core that has an oxide compound or salt and (ii) a bioadhesive<br>
polymer. The bioadhesive polymer is attached to the oxide compound or salt. Also<br>
provided are processes for preparing the particle, methods for inhibiting or reducing the<br>
formation of plaque on an oral surface using the particle, and other related methods.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0005]       Figure 1 illustrates a reaction scheme for oxidation of a polysaccharide<br>
to provide carbonyl groups, followed by reacting the resulting polymer to attach it to the<br>
surface of a solid particle core, by reaction of the carbonyl groups with amine groups.<br>
[0006]       Figure 2 illustrates a reaction scheme for attaching a carboxylic acid-<br>
containing polymer to the surface of a solid particle core, by reaction of a carboxyl<br>
hydroxy group, using carbodiiniide chemistry and N-hydroxysuccinimide, to form a<br>
succinimide ester, which is then reacted with amino groups tethered to the particle core<br>
surface to form an amino alkanoate {i. e. alkanoyloxy-amino) linkage.<br>
[0007]       Figure 3 provide a graphic representation of the overall process for<br>
preparing a particle according to an embodiment of the present invention by pre-treating<br>
the particle core {e.g., silica) with a compound that provides tethered amino groups<br>
attached to the surface thereof, followed by reaction chemistry to link a carbonyl or acid<br>
group-containing polymer to the tethered amino groups.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]       The present invention relates to compositions and methods for<br>
inhibiting biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to surfaces, including industrial,<br>
household, medical, human and animal somatic surfaces, particularly oral plaque<br>
deposition and bacterial adhesion to dental surfaces.<br>
[0009]       The compositions described herein prevent and/or disrupt bacterial<br>
attachment to teeth, gums and other oral surfaces, without requiring application of a<br>
contiguous polymer layer.<br>
[0010]       The present invention also provides an approach to deliver benefit for<br>
prevention of bacterial adhesion/attachment to biological and other surfaces generally<br>
{e.g., tooth surfaces, mucosal surfaces, and/or derma surfaces). The approach takes<br>
advantage of the anti-fouling properties of bioadhesive polymers, preferably<br>
polysaccharides and related polymers, such as polysaccharides, dextran, and hyaluronate<br>
(HA). Particles according to the present invention are provided that comprise such<br>
polymers stably attached to solid particle cores, such as particle cores of silicon oxide<br>
(Si02) or zinc oxide (ZnO). These particles are applied to surfaces, which may be<br>
biological surfaces, such as oral surfaces, in order to create a barrier against microbial<br>
(e.g., bacterial) attachment thereto, as well as against attachment to the treated surface by<br>
organic molecules (e.g., organic scum components). The present invention provides<br>
methods for inhibiting bacterial attachment to such surfaces, e.g., the tooth and oral soft<br>
tissue surfaces, thereby inhibiting the onset and/or rate of biofilm formation and<br>
deposition and/or reducing the strength of biofilm adhesion, which in the case of oral use<br>
can thereby inhibit the onset of dental caries and periodontal diseases such as gingivitis<br>
and periodontitis. The particles, e.g., of Si02 or ZnO, can be, and preferably are,<br>
included in formulations for application to a surface, for example, dentifrice formulations<br>
and other oral care consumer products, and may also be included in oral care products for<br>
the dental professional.<br>
[0011]       Particles according to the present invention include a core. The<br>
particle core(s) may be a solid particle core(s) that is at least substantially water<br>
insoluble. In one embodiment, the particle cores will be particulate entities comprising<br>
one or more of the at least substantially water insoluble, metals, semi-metals, and non-<br>
metals; metal, semi-metal, non-metal, and mixed-metal halides, carbides, nitrides,<br>
sulfides, oxides (including, e.g., carbonates, phosphates, sulfates), and the like, as well as<br>
ceramics, minerals (including biominerals), and alloys thereof. Examples of such<br>
substances include: AgBr, A1N, A1203, BaLiF3, BaY2F8, Bi203, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, CuCl,<br>
FeC, Fe4N, Fe203, GaAs, GaP, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, InAs, InP, InSn, KI, LiCaAlF6, LiNb,<br>
NaCl, NiO, SiC, Si3N4, Si02, Sn02, TiN, Ti02, W03, YLiF4, ZnC, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe,<br>
ZrN, ZnO, Sn, Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pt, carbon, silicon, germanium; compounds, salts, and<br>
complexes comprising them; and mixtures of any of the foregoing with one another or<br>
with a further component.<br>
[0012]       In one embodiment, a metal(s) for use in such metal compounds, salts,<br>
and mixtures will be chosen from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Zn, Sn, Fe, Se, Cu,<br>
Mn, Mo, Co, Ni, Cr, V, W, Ti, and Al, preferably from alkali metals, alkaline earth<br>
metals, Zn, Sn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mo, and Ti, more preferably from alkali metals, alkaline<br>
earth metals, and Zn. In one preferred embodiment, the metal(s) will comprise any one<br>
of alkaline earth metals, Zn, or a combination thereof with one another or with an alkali<br>
metal(s) or both.<br>
[0013]       In one embodiment, the solid particle cores will comprise an oxide<br>
compound or its salt. Preferred oxides include substantially water insoluble: simple<br>
oxides, carbon oxides (e.g., metal carbonates), phosphorus oxides (e.g., metal phosphates,<br>
metal polyphosphates), sulfur oxides (e.g., metal sulfates), silicates, and combinations<br>
thereof. In one embodiment, the particle core will comprise a simple oxide compound.<br>
Examples of simple oxide compounds include AI2O3, Fe2C"3, MgAl2O4, SiC2, Sn02, T1O2,<br>
and ZnO, and combinations thereof, e.g., xMOy-zAl2O3SiO2 systems (M being a metal<br>
cation(s)). In a preferred embodiment, the simple oxide compound may be Si02 or ZnO.<br>
[0014]       In one embodiment, the particle core will comprise at least one oxide<br>
compound or salt that is a carbon oxide, phosphorus oxide, sulfur oxide, or silicate.<br>
Preferred examples for each of these respectively include homo- and hetero-metal: 1)<br>
carbonates, e.g., CaCC&gt;3, CaMg(CO3)2; 2a) polyphosphates such as pyrophosphates, e.g.,<br>
Ca2P207, CaMgP207, and 2b) phosphates, e.g., Ca3(PO4)2, hydroxyapatites such as<br>
Caio(P04)6(OH)2), oxyapatites such as Ca10(CPO4)6O, haloapatites, haloahydroxypatites,<br>
and halo-oxyapatites such as Cai5(P04)9(F)0; 3) sulfates, e.g., CaSO4 and sulfate apatites •<br>
such as Na6Ca4(S04)6(F,Ol)2; and 4) silicates, e.g., Al2Si05, sodium silicates, calcium<br>
silicates, and micas. In one embodiment, metal carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates are<br>
preferred. Combination oxides belonging to more than one such class may be used, e.g.,<br>
carbonate apatites such as Ca10(P04)6CO3, silicate sulfate apatites such as<br>
Ca10(Si04)3(S04)3(OH,F,Cl)2, carbonate sulfates such as Ca2(S04)(C03), phosphate<br>
sulfates such as Ca2HP04S04, and silicate phosphates and sulfate phosphates such as the<br>
calcium silicate phosphates or sulfate phosphates, e.g., Ca5(Si04,P04,S04)3(F,Cl,0,OH).<br>
[0015]       The solid particle cores may alternatively or in addition comprise<br>
polymer(s) that are at least substantially water insoluble, and preferably not significantly<br>
water-swellable, such as polyolefins, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyesters (including<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates), and the like. Where a particle core is selected for use in an oral<br>
care composition, it will be orally acceptable, e.g., no significant toxicity under the<br>
conditions and concentrations used, etc.<br>
[0016]       The particle cores are preferably substantially water insoluble. As<br>
used herein, this means that the particle cores will retain their dimensions under aqueous<br>
conditions at a pH between pH6 and pH8, for at least 3 hours, preferably for at least 4, at<br>
least 5, or at least 6 hours. In some cases, the particles, deposited on the oral surface,<br>
may come into contact with bacterial or food acids. Where such acidic conditions are to<br>
be present, preferably the material for the particle core will be one that is either resistant<br>
to such acid attack, or will be one that erodes or degrades to produce non-toxic products.<br>
Examples of particle core materials that can degrade under acidic conditions to produce<br>
non-toxic products include the non-toxic metal carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates,<br>
preferably where the metal comprises a non-toxic alkaline earth metal, preferably calcium<br>
(i.e., Ca(II) cation).<br>
[0017]       The use of such acid-degradable materials for particle cores in an oral<br>
composition can provide a population of particles layered upon oral surfaces, which<br>
particles remain insoluble until bacterial accumulation has occurred to the point that<br>
microbial acid production is significant. From that point, such a layer of particles<br>
behaves as a sacrificial, acid-neutralizing layer that provides further protection to the<br>
tooth against acid attack. Such particles can also provide a benefit by helpirg neutralize<br>
acids from other sources, as well, such as food acids (e.g., saturated and unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids, including acetic, oxalic, citric, malic, and tartaric acids; and phosphoric<br>
acid) and gastric acids, which are similarly capable of eroding dental enamel.<br>
[0018]       The particle cores may have any morphology  Preferred morphologies<br>
include those that are at least substantially: spheroidal, ellipsoidal, or flat. The particle<br>
cores may have any size, preferably less than 1 mm. In one embodiment, the average<br>
maximum dimension of the particle cores, i.e. their average largest diameter or other<br>
axial dimension, will preferably be from about 1 nm to about 100 um, more preferably<br>
from about 10 nm to about 100 um. Thus, in one embodiment, the core sizes will be<br>
nanoscopic or microsopic in scale. In one embodiment, the particle cores will have an<br>
average size of about 1 to about 100 um, preferably about 5 to about 50 jxm, more<br>
preferably about 5 to about 25 um. In one embodiment, the particle core sizes will be<br>
from about 1 nm to about 1 um; thus, the particle core can have the dimensions of a<br>
colloid. In one embodiment, the particle core can have the dimensions of a single<br>
molecule. Thus, the overall particle can have the form of a regular or irregular<br>
hyperbranched structure, e.g., a dendrimer or brush architecture. Such molecular-scale<br>
cores are distinguished from larger-scale "super-molecular" scale particles used as cores,<br>
e.g., those of lnm to 1 mm size.<br>
[0019]       Super-molecular-scale particle cores may be porous or non-porous; in<br>
one embodiment, they will be at least substantially non-porous. Where a porous material<br>
is used in or as the particle core, the pores thereof may optionally contain an orally<br>
acceptable, e.g.: medicament, such as an antibacterial agent (e.g., triclosan), an<br>
antioxidant, or a pain relief agent; a nutraceutical, such as a botanical extract (e.g.,<br>
magnolia extract, tea extract); vitamin; breath freshening agent; or other agent or<br>
combination thereof to be released in the oral cavity.<br>
[0020]       The attachments may be and means known in the art, and may include<br>
any type of bond attachment form and/or one or more intervening or linker molecule(s).<br>
The particles will comprise the particle core conjugated to at least one bioadhesive<br>
polymer that has been attached to the particle by covalent or non-covalent binding. In the<br>
case of covalent binding to the core, this will take place by reaction involving reactive<br>
group pairs: one member of the pair being provided by the particle core, or a linker or<br>
other reactive group pre-attached thereto, and one member by the polymer, or a linker or<br>
other reactive group pre-attached thereto. In one embodiment, the reactive group<br>
provided by the polymer will be a primary or secondary carbonyl group(s) or acid<br>
group(s).<br>
[0021]       Bioadhesive polymers include any natural or s}mthetic homo- or<br>
hetero-polymer that is capable of adhering, whether by physical attraction or chemical<br>
reaction, to a desired target surface, e.g., a hard or soft oral surface, throughout the<br>
minimum time considered effective for the selected use. Preferred examples of classes of<br>
bioadhesive polymers include:<br>
(1)	polysaccharides and related polymers;<br>
(2)	polypeptides (including dipeptides, oligopeptides), such as albumins, caseins,<br>
collagens, fibrins, gelatins, globulins (e.g., immunoglobulins), lectins, prolamins (such as<br>
avenins, gliadins, glutelins, glutens, glutenins, hordeins, kafirins, oryzins, pennisetins,<br>
secalins, zeins), synthetic polyamides, and targeted polypeptides (e.g., polypeptide<br>
aptamers);<br>
(3)	acrylic polymers, such as homo- and hetero-polyrners of acrylate and/or<br>
acrylamide monomers, including acrylate and (e.g., C1-C4) alkylacrylate salts and esters,<br>
and (e.g., C1-C4) alkylacrylamides, with one another (e.g., polymethylmethacrylates)<br>
and/or with alginic acid or other comonomers, cyanoacrylates;<br>
(4)	other poly-acid polymers, such as homo- and hetero-polyrners of non-acrylic,<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids, e.g., other poly(unsaturated carboxylic, i.e. mono-, di-, and<br>
poly-carboxylic, acid) polymers, such as poly(crotonic, itaconic, and/or maleic acid)<br>
polymers, polyphosphates, poly(organic-phosphate or -phosphonate) polymers,<br>
poly(organic-sulfate or -sulfonate) polymers, poly(unsaturated hydroxycarboxylic acid)<br>
polymers, and the like;<br>
(5)	polyesters, including homo- and hetero-polyhydroxyalkanoates (e.g.,<br>
polylactic acid polymers, polyglycolides, and the like), functionalized polyesters (e.g.,<br>
carboxylated polyesters, hydroxypolyesters), and polyorthoesters;<br>
(6)	polyanhydrides, such as poly(fumaric-co-sebacic) acid polymers;<br>
(7)	polyalkylene polymers, such as synthetic polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols<br>
(e.g., polyethylene glycols), polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terephthalates, and the<br>
like;<br>
(8)	polysiloxanes;<br>
(9)	polyurethanes; and<br>
(10)	polyvinyl polymers, such as poly(vinyl alcohols), polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl<br>
ethers, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylphenols, and polyvinylpyrrolidones.<br>
[0022]       Such bioadhesive polymers may be provided in the form of linear or<br>
branched polymers, or may be provided in the form of larger structures comprising such<br>
polymers, e.g., colloids or latexes. In some cases, a monomer of such a bioadhesive<br>
polymer may itself provide bioadhesion. Thus, in some embodiments, the bioadhesive<br>
can be a bioadhesive monomer, such as an amino acid or a monosaccharide.<br>
[0023]       Bioadhesive polymers can be readily obtained from commercial<br>
sources including, e.g., Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY, USA), Polysciences (Warrenton, PA,<br>
USA), and Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA; and St. Louis, MO, USA); or can be<br>
synthesized from monomers obtained from these suppliers using well-known techniques.<br><br>
[0024]       In one embodiment, the bioadhesive polymer will be a biocompatible<br>
polymer. In one embodiment, the polymer will be a polysaccharide 01 related polymer.<br>
Examples of useful polysaccharides and related polymers include: poly(saccharides);<br>
poly(mono- and di-deoxy saccharides); poly(sugar acids), e.g., poly(glyc-uronic, -onic,<br>
-aric, and -ulosonic acids); poly(sugar alcohols); and poly(amino sugars).<br>
[0025]       Such polysaccharides and related polymers may be based on any<br>
aldose or ketose monomers, such as: aldo- or keto-triose, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses,<br>
heptoses; their deoxy, acid, alcohol, and amine cognates; their substituted derivatives;<br>
and the like. Thus, polysaccharide and related polymers useful herein may comprise<br>
substituted or unsubstituted monomer unit(s), or both. Where substituted monomer<br>
unit(s) are present in the polysaccharide or related polymer, the substitutions will<br>
preferably be selected from C1-C4: alkyl ether (e.g. methyl, ethyl, or propyl ether),<br>
hydroxyalkyl ether, and carboxyalkyl ether substitutions; alkylamine and alkaroylamine<br>
(e.g., N-acetyl), or sulfamidic, sulfonamide, and sulfamic (e.g., N-sulfo), substitutions;<br>
alkanoyl ester, e.g., pyruvic, acetic, and formic ester, or sulfoxy or phosphoxy acid ester,<br>
substitutions (on polymer hydroxyl groups); and alkanol, diol, and polyol ester<br>
substitutions (on polymer acid groups).<br>
[0026]       In one embodiment, the monomeric units of the polysaccharide or<br>
related polymer will preferably be selected from the substituted and unsubstituted hexose,<br>
hexulose, hexonic acid, hexuronic acid, hexaric acid, hexulosonic acid, pentose,<br>
pentulose, pentonic acid, penturonic acid, pentonic acid, and pentulosonic acid residues.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer will be a glucose, glucose acid, and/or glucose alcohol<br>
polymer or copolymer.<br>
[0027]       Representative examples of preferred polysaccharides and related<br>
polymers include: celluloses; chitosans; starches; glycogens; gums, e.g., plant, microbial, •<br>
and algal gums, such as agaroses, guars, dextrans, and carrageenans, and synthetic<br>
polysaccharide-based gums; and glycosaminoglycans, e.g., dermatans, chrondroitins,<br>
heparans, hyaluronates, and keratins, including dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate,<br>
heparan sulfate, heparin, and keratan sulfate; substituted saccharide polymers, e.g., alkyl<br>
celluloses, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, carboxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose esters (including,<br>
e.g., nitrocelluloses), and the like; microbial exopolymers; and structures comprising such<br>
polymers, e.g., marine colloids and synthetic hydrocolloids of polysaccharides. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the polysaccharide or related polymer will be a poly or<br>
copoly(saccharide), a gum, or a glycosaminoglycan; preferred gums include dextran;<br>
preferred glycosaminoglycans include hyaluronic acid.<br>
[0028]       In one embodiment, the bioadhesive polymer will be a polycarboxylate<br>
polymer, for example, any one of the: poly(acrylate and/or methacrylate) polymers; other<br>
poly(acid) polymers; and carboxylated derivatives of any polymer class, such as a<br>
carboxylated polysaccharide or related polymer, carboxylated polypeptide (e.g., a<br>
poly(acidic-side-chain)peptide), or a carboxylated polyester. Examples of carboxylated<br>
polysaccharides and related polymers include alginates, carboxymethylated<br>
polysaccharides (e.g., carboxymethyl starch, carboxymethyl cellulose), hyaluronates,<br>
oxidized polysaccharides (e.g., oxidized starch, oxidized guar gum), pectates,<br>
polyaspartate, polyglutamates, xanthans, and the like.<br>
[0029]       Polymers to be attached to the core can be chemically modified to<br>
increase bioadhesion. For example, the polymers can be modified by altering the number<br>
of negatively charged (e.g., carboxylate) groups and/or positively charged (e.g., amino)<br>
groups, present on the polymer surface. Such modifications can be made in order to<br>
enhance the ability of the polymer to adhere to charged surface domains of dental tissues.<br>
For example, bare regions of dental enamel may present a number of positively charged<br>
surface domains, while salivary glycoprotein-coated zones on enamel often present<br>
negatively charged domains. Polymers respectively having negative or positive charges,<br>
i.e. under the conditions of use, may be selected, prepared, or modified, so as to obtain an<br>
advantageous degree of polymer adhesion to such surface charges. Chemical<br>
modifications to the polymers may be made by employing any of the useful linkage<br>
chemistries known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2005/064027 Al to Jacob et al, the contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0030]       In one embodiment, the bioadhesive polymer will be a hydrophilic<br>
bioadhesive polymer. In one embodiment, the hydrophilic bioadhesive polymer will be<br>
any that provide an adhesive effect when deposited on or attached to a surface in an<br>
aqueous environment; preferably it will be a hydrophilic polymer that is capable of<br>
forming hydrogels (including, e.g., true gels, microgels, quasi-gels, pseudo-gels, and the<br>
like) or hydrocolloids.<br>
[0031]       Useful bioadhesive polymers for attachment to a particle core will be<br>
those that are capable of physically or chemically adhering to the particle core such that,<br>
under conditions of use, the polymer will not separate from the core for about 3 hours or<br>
more, and preferably until, e.g., the core degrades or the polymer is chemically or<br>
biologically hydrolyzed by components of the environment.<br>
[0032]       In one embodiment, the bioadhesive polymer will be covalently linked<br>
to the core. In one embodiment, the bioadhesive polymer will be covalently linked to a<br>
moiety that is a linker, which is itself covalently or non-covalently linked to the core.<br>
Such a linker may be first attached to the core and then contacted with the bioadhesive<br>
polymer, or may first be attached to the bioadhesive polymer, and then contacted with the<br>
core. All three components may be concurrently attached together. Alternatively, a first<br>
linker may be attached to the core, and a second linker may separately be attached to the<br>
polymer, the first and second linkers jointly providing a reactive group pair that can be<br>
covalently linked, or jointly providing non-covalently-interacting surfaces that form a<br>
stable non-covalent attachment; followed by contacting the derivatized cores and<br>
derivatized polymers. Alternatively, the particle core may be covalently attached to a<br>
linker that is capable of forming stable non-covalent attachment to the bioadhesive<br>
polymer.<br>
[0033]       In embodiments in which the bioadhesive polyimer is covalently<br>
attached to either a linker or directly to the core surface, the polymer will have at least<br>
one reactive group that is useful for reacting to provide a covalent linkage, e.g., any one<br>
of: a carbonyl group, such as an aldehyde group; an amine group, such as a primary<br>
amine group, an acid group or derivative, such as an amide or ester, e.g., a carboxylic<br>
acid, amide, or ester; a hydroxide group; and the like. In one embodiment, a preferred<br>
bioadhesive polymer will be one that contains, or that has been derivatized to contain, an<br>
aldehyde or carboxylic acid group(s).<br>
[0034]       As is the case for any biopolymers lacking a desired reactive group,<br>
where a bioadhesive polymer is selected that does not have any carbonyl or acid groups,<br>
or any aldehyde or carboxylic acid groups in particular (if desired), or does not have a<br>
number or carbonyl or acid groups sufficient for the practitioner's desire, then the<br>
polymer will be pre-treated to provide such group(s) before reaction to link the polymer<br>
to the particle core or to the linker. Likewise, where other linking chemistries are chosen,<br>
the reactive groups may be already present in the polymer and particle core, or may be<br>
added thereto by pretreatment.<br>
[0035]       Thus, other linkage chemistries may alternatively be employed,<br>
wherein the polymer and the particle core or linker together provide a reactive group pair,<br>
one of the two providing a nucleophilic group, and the other provide an electrophilic<br>
group. The nucleophile and the electrophile groups may be already present on the<br>
particle core or linker, or the polymer, or the particle core or linker and/or the polymer<br>
may be pretreated to contain them, using any of the many chemistries known useful in the<br>
art therefor. Representative examples of such chemistries include those employing<br>
nucleophile and the electrophile group pairs such as those listed in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
[0036]       In one preferred embodiment, the reactive group pair will comprise an<br>
amine group provided by the particle core and a polymer aldehyde group with which it<br>
forms a Schiff base that is then reduced (e.g., using a cyanoborohydrate salt) to form a<br>
secondary amine linkage. In one preferred embodiment, the reactive group pair will<br>
comprise an amine group provided by the particle core and a polymer acid group that has<br>
been derivatized in a process using carbodiimide chemistry to form a succinimide ester.<br>
[0037]       The set of bioadhesive polymer molecules conjugated to the particle<br>
core(s) may comprise more than one type of polymer, and/or more than one type of<br>
attachment to the particle core. For example, a particle core may comprise tethers of<br>
different lengths to which the polymer(s) are to be attached, or different electrophilic or<br>
nucleophilic groups may be provided on the particle core surface or on the distal end of<br>
the linker, so that a variety of different reaction chemistries are used to attach the<br>
polymer(s) thereto.<br>
[0038]       In an embodiment in which the particle core provides an amino group<br>
for the linking reaction, this will preferably be a tethered primary or secondary amino<br>
group, preferably a tethered primary amino group that has been added fo the surface of<br>
the particle core by pre-treatment with an amino group-containing agent. Preferred<br>
amino group-containing agents for this purpose include, e.g., amino silicone compounds.<br>
[0039]       In one preferred embodiment, an amino silicone compound will be an<br>
(omega-aminoaliphatyl)-tri(aliphatoxy)siloxane of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is a C1-C8 homo- or hetero-hydrocarbon group, and R2, R3, and R4 are<br>
independently selected from C1-C8 homo- or hetero-hydrocarbon groups, hydrocarbon in<br>
either case referring to cyclic, alicyclic, branched, and linear hydrocarbons.   As used<br>
herein, the term C1 homo-  or hetero-hydrocarbon group refers to  organic  groups<br>
containing one carbon atom, examples of which in0clude -CH3-, -CH2-, -CH2SiH2-.<br>
[0040]       In one embodiment thereof, R1 will be selected from the C1-C8<br>
aliphatic (including cycloaliphatic) groups. In one embodiment, R2, R3, and R will be<br>
independently selected from the C1-C8 alphatic groups.<br>
[0041]       In one embodiment thereof, R1 will be selected from the C1-C5 alkyl<br>
groups. In one embodiment, R2, R3, and R4 will be independently selected from the C1-<br>
C5 alkyl groups. In one embodiment, the selected R1 group will be larger than any of the<br>
selected groups for R2, R3, and R4. In one embodiment, R2 ?nd R4 will be identical<br>
groups. In one embodiment, R2, R3, and R4 will be identical groups. In one embodiment,<br>
R'willbeaC1C2, G3, or C4 group; preferably a n-propa-l,3-diyl group. In one<br>
embodiment, R2, R3, and R4 will independently be ethyl or methyl; preferably R2, R3, and<br>
R4 will all be ethyl or will all be methyl.<br>
[0042]       Preferred examples of useful (omega-arninoalkyl)-trialkoxysiloxanes<br>
include: 3-ami0nopropyltriethoxysilane, H2N(CH2)3Si(OCH2CH3)3; 3-<br>
aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, H2N(CH2)3 Si(OCH3)3; 2-aminoethyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
H2N(CH2)2Si(OCH3)3; and 2-aminoethyltriethoxysilane, H2N(CH2)2Si(OCH2CH3)3.<br>
[0043]       Reaction conditions use%l for particle pretreatinents and for linkage<br>
reactions are well known in the art. Any such conditions may be used, such as those<br>
described in the examples below.<br>
[0044]       The particles hereof may be provided for use in the form of a<br>
composition comprising them. A composition according to the present invention may<br>
comprise a mixture of different particles that vary from one another in the identity of the<br>
core material, porosity, size, morphology, polymer identity, or polymer-to-particle<br>
attachment.<br>
[0045]       A composition hereof may be a dentifrice (e.g., paste, gel, powder, or<br>
liquid dentifrice), prophylaxis paste, dental paint, lozenge, chewing gum, or other<br>
abrasive, detergent, or cleansing composition capable, either alone or in combination with<br>
the action of an applicator, of removing deposits, such as plaque, from teeth and/or from<br>
oral soft tissues. Similar solid, semi-solid, and liquid formats may be useful for other<br>
topical and for systemic uses, e.g., as well as tablets, capsules, ointments, creams, pre-<br>
gels, lavages, surgical site washes, parenteral solutions and suspension, and suppositories.<br>
Compositions may also be formulated as industrial or consumer product paints, sprays,<br>
cleansers, dips, rinses, and the like.<br>
[0046]       Alternatively, a topical or oral composition may be designed as a post-<br>
cleansing treatment composition, such as a liquid-gel, slurry, or suspension mouthwash or<br>
mouth rinse. In oral, topical, and systemic somatic uses, the composition will<br>
respectively comprise orally, topically, or systemically acceptable substances. Such<br>
substances include a solid, semi-solid, or liquid carrier, and may optionally include one or<br>
more: other active ingredients, e.g., antibacterial agents (e.g., a water-insoluble non-<br>
cationic antibacterial agent, such as triclosan), antioxidants, pharmaceuticals, vitamins,<br>
fluoride sources, nutraceuticals, and the like; excipients and inert ingredients, e.g.,<br>
humectants, gelling agents, thickeners, solvents, diluents, binders, fillers, plasticizers,<br>
anti-caking agents, disintegrants, gums, emollients, oleochemicals, colorants, flavorants,<br>
odorants, pH adjusting agents (acids, bases), buffers, surfactants, emulsifiers, suspending<br>
agents, enzymes, coatings (e.g., enteric, acrylic, or carbohydrate or cellulosic coatings),<br>
chelants, preservatives, and the like. Representative examples of such well-known<br>
additives are described, e.g., in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos.<br>

2004); 60/639,331 to Xu et al. for Oral Care Compositions Containing Flavonoids and<br>
Flavans (filed Dec. 22, 2004); and 60/639,169 to Boyd et al. for Oral Compositions<br>
Containing Oolong Tea Extract (filed Dec. 23, 2004); as well as in L.V. Allen Jr., The<br>

ed., 2001); and R.C. Rowe et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (4th ed., 2003);<br>
all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0047] A composition according to the present invention comprises a carrier.<br>
Carriers are commonly water, aqueous humectant, and/or aqueous alcohol mixtures of a<br>
consistency appropriate for the selected mode of administration of the composition, e.g.,<br>
as a paste, gel, tablet, lozenge, syrup, rinse, and so forth. Carriers for oral compositions<br>
according to the present invention include all known in the art.<br>
[0048]       Such orally acceptable carriers include the usaal components of<br>
toothpastes, tooth powders, prophylaxis pastes, mouth rinses, lozenges, gums and the<br>
like, and are more fully described hereinafter. Selection of specific carrier components is<br>
dependant on the desired product form, including dentifrices, rinses, gels, and<br>
confectionaries.<br>
[0049]       In various embodiments, the orally acceptable dentifrice carrier used to *<br>
prepare an oral composition comprises a water-phase. As recognized by one of skill in<br>
the art, the oral compositions of the present invention optionally include other materials,<br>
such as for example, viscosity modifiers, diluents, surface active agents, such as<br>
surfactants, emulsifiers, and foam modulators, pH modifying agents, abrasives,<br>
humectants, emollients, and moisturizers, mouth feel agents, sweetening agents, flavor<br>
agents, colorants, preservatives and combinations thereof. It is understood that while<br>
general attributes of each of the above categories of materials may differ, there may be<br>
some common attributes and any given material may serve multiple purposes within two<br>
or more of such categories of materials. Preferably, such carrier materials are selected for<br>
compatibility with the particles, as well as with other ingredients of the composition.<br>
[0050]       In the case of mouth washes, sprays, or rinses, orally acceptable<br>
carriers typically comprise an aqueous phase comprising water or a water and alcohol<br>
mixture. Further, in various embodiments, the oral carrier comprises a humectant and/or<br>
a surfactant. Generally, the weight ratio of water to alcohol is in the range of from about<br>
1:1 to about 20:1, preferably about 3:1 to 10:1 and more preferably about 4:1 to about<br>
6:1. The total amount of water-alcohol mixture in this type of preparation is typically in<br>
the range of from about 70 to about 99.9% of the preparation. In various embodiments,<br>
the alcohol is typically ethanol or isopropanol. The pH of such liquid and other<br>
preparations of the invention is generally in the range of from about 4.5 to about 10,<br>
which can be achieved and/or maintained with a pH control agent (acid or base) and/or a<br>
buffer such as sodium citrate, benzoate, carbonate, or bicarbonate, disodium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, or sodium dihydrogen phosphate.<br>
[0051] In the case of, e.g., lozenges, tablets, and beads, an orally acceptable<br>
carrier can be a non-cariogenic, solid water-soluble polyhydric alcohol (polyol) such as<br>
mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, malitol, hydrogenated starch hydrozylate, hydrogenated<br>
glucose, hydrogenated disaccharides or hydrogenated polysaccharides, in an amount of<br>
about 85 to about 95% of the total composition. Emulsifiers such as glycerin, and<br>
tableting lubricants, in minor amounts of about 0.1 to 5%, may be incorporated into the<br>
tablet, bead or lozenge formulation to facilitate the preparation of the tablet beads and<br>
lozenges. In the case of dentifrices including toothpowders, toothpastes (dental creams),   '<br>
and gels, an orally acceptable carrier may comprise water and humectant typically in an<br>
amount ranging from about 10% to about 80% of the oral composition.<br>
[0052]       In one embodiment, a composition, as formulated for application in the<br>
selected end-use, according to the present invention will comprise an amount of particles<br>
that is about 50% or less by weight of the composition, or about or less than 40%, 30,%<br>
20%, or 10% of the composition. In one embodiment, the composition will comprise<br>
from about 1% to about 10% by weight of the composition, more preferably about 5%.<br>
Compositions hereof may also be provided as concentrated pre-mixes, or the pure<br>
particles may be supplied in frozen, dry, or lyophilized form, with instructions for the<br>
manner of using these to prepare a final formulation for use. In such compositions, the<br>
composition can comprise more than 50%, and up to 100% of the weight thereof.<br>
[0053]       Particles according to the present invention are useful for efficiently<br>
delivering bioadhesive polymers to the oral surfaces, where they adhere to block<br>
attachment or adhesion by bacteria. Preferably, an orally acceptable composition<br>
comprising the particles is applied to the oral cavity by contacting oral surface(s) with the<br>
composition. In an embodiment, particles introduced into the oral cavity, either during or<br>
after cleansing of oral surfaces, can remain resident upon cleansed oral surfaces to inhibit<br>
or reduce bacterial attachment, plaque formation, and the like. Compositions hereof may<br>
also be used to prevent or reduce bacterial adhesion to skin, hair, medical implants,<br>
stents, IV lines, implements, and the like.<br>
[0054]       Compositions hereof may also be used to prevent or reduce biofilm<br>
formation or microbial adhesion in contexts other than oral, topical, systemic, or even<br>
somatic applications. For example, biofilm formation, microbial adhesion, and<br>
biofouling may be reduced in marine and freshwater applications, or in aqueous handling<br>
(storage or transport) or treatment systems, by applying such a composition to surfaces of<br>
that are in, or are to be placed into, contact with an aqueous environment. Such<br>
compositions can also be used as biofilm release enhancers, such as for use on re-usable<br>
components of such marine, freshwater, and aqueous handling or treatments systems,<br>
e.g., mesh screens, filter plates, filtering cartridges, and the like.<br>
[0055]       Such compositions may be applied to industrial or to household system -<br>
components to inhibit biofilm formation and/or to provide a biofilm release agent to<br>
facilitate removal of, e.g., mildew, algae, fungi, bacteria, and organic scum during<br>
cleaning. For example, the compositions may be advantageously applied to, e.g., boats,<br>
ships, rafts, flotation platforms, pontoon bridges, docks, food processing surfaces, grout,<br>
sinks, faucets, water fountains and fonts, birdbaths, swimming pools and accessories<br>
(e.g., stairs, slides), air humidifiers, drain holes and pipes, storage tanks, water pump and<br>
stirring vanes, drain plugs and strainers, condensation drip pans, toilet bowls, toilet<br>
reservoirs, bathtub mats and other bathtub accessories (shelf units, footpads, shower<br>
curtains), bathtub and pool covers, sliding door tracks, bathtub and shower enclosures,<br>
aquarium surfaces, animal watering bottles and bowls, and the like.<br>
[0056]       Thus, in one method according to the present invention, a composition<br>
comprising the inventive particles will be applied to a surface upon which deposition of<br>
the particles is desired. The non-deposited ingredients of the composition may then<br>
remain in contact with the surface, but are more often rinsed away or bioabsorbed. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the composition will be a cleansing composition (e.g., an abrasive<br>
and/or detergent composition) formulated for cleaning of the surface, e.g., a wash. In one<br>
embodiment, the composition will be any capable of depositing the particles on a new or<br>
already-cleaned surface, e.g., a rinse.<br>
[0057]       In a method according to the present invention, inventive particles are<br>
prepared by process comprising providing a core, a bioadhesive polymer, and optionally<br>
a linker, and attaching the bioadhesive polymer to the core.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Pretreatment of Particles to Add Tethered Amine Groups<br>
[0058]        SiO2 (ZEODENT® silica, 8-16 urn average diameter particles,<br>
available from J.M Huber Corp., Edison, NJ, USA) are etched clean with a strongly<br>
oxidizing solution of H2SO4/H2O2 (75%/25% v/v). Next, the Si02 is modified by<br>
deposition of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). Although solution deposition is<br>
preferred, vapor deposition may be substituted therefor. The vapor deposition route<br>
utilizes strict anhydrous conditions, as may be afforded, e.g., by a dry glove box, in order<br>
to avoid unwanted hydrolysis reactions. Solution deposition under acidic conditions<br>
provides a more widely applicable procedure. In this approach Si02 is dispersed in<br>
distilled H2O and the pH of the resulting solution is adjusted to an approximate pH value<br>
of 6.5 with HNO3. The suspension is then stirred for 1 hour, after which time 1 mL of<br>
APTES is added, and the suspension stirred again. After 24 hours of stirring, the excess<br>
APTES is removed by filtration and washing with ethanol and acetone. Cross-linking of<br>
the deposited APTES molecules is desirable. In order to promote the cross-linking (i.e.<br>
condensation) of individual APTES molecules on the Si02 surface, the modified silica is<br>
dried at 800°C, preferably for about 8 hours. ZnO particles may be similarly pre-treated<br>
to provide pendant amine groups.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of Particles Conjugated to Polysaccharide Gum<br>
[0059]       The microbial gum, dextran, is covalently attached to amino-modified<br>
particle cores prepared according to Example 1, i.e. APTES-modified Si02 particles<br>
(hereinafter Si02+APTES). The polysaccharide is first pre-treated to provide carbonyl<br>
groups thereon. As shown in Fig. 1, the dextran is treated with sodium periodate (NaI04)<br>
to oxidize the saccharide ring(s), forming aldehyde carbonyl groups and releasing formic<br>
acid. The product of the oxidation reaction is the dialdehyde corresponding to (2). The<br>
surface bound APTES is able to reductively aminate (2) to form a Schiff base (structure<br>
not shown), which is reduced by sodium cyanoborohydrate (NaBH3CN) to form a stable<br>
secondary amine linkage. Since the extent of dextran oxidation controls the amount of<br>
(2) produced, it also controls the grafting density (i.e. number of bonds) between dextran<br>
and the Si02+APTES. In order to optimize the dextran grafting density, a variety of<br>
dextran oxidation times are employed, e.g.: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours. Other experimental<br>
parameters that are considered are the size (i.e. molecular weight) and polydispersity (i.e.<br>
broadness of molecular weight distribution) of dextran. These two structural properties<br>
will also affect the extent of interaction between individual Si02 particles. The result is<br>
dextran-linked Si02 particles.<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of Particles Conjugated to Glycosaminoglycan<br>
[0060]       Hyaluronate (HA) is covalently grafted to hereinafter Si02+APTES<br>
particles, prepared as in Example 1. Since HA has a carboxylate functionality, no<br>
modification is necessary prior to grafting. Covalent attachment of hyaluronate to<br>
SiO2+APTES is achieved by N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide(EDC) /<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling chemistry (see Figure 2). The grafting density of<br>
hyaluronate on SiO2+APTES is controlled by varying the EDC/NHS ratio.<br>
[0061]       Note that, for HA, periodate chemistry, such as described in Example<br>
2, can alternatively be used to form aldehyde carbonyl groups to produce an HA<br>
derivative that can be covalently attached to a particle core by reaction involving such<br>
carbonyl groups. Similarly, polymers having primary amine groups, hydroxyl groups, or<br>
acid (or ester or amide) groups can be covalently attached to a raw or derivatized particle<br>
core by reaction involving any one or more of those chemical groups present in the<br>
polymer with a corresponding reactive pair group present on the particle core.<br>
[0062]       The overall modification process is shown schematically in Figure 3,<br>
which illustrates the preparation of Si02+APTES particles conjugated to a dextran<br>
derivative, as described in Example 2, or with HA residues as described in Example 3.<br>
[0063]       Preferred concentrations of the particles in an orally acceptable<br>
composition can be determined by routine analysis of a series of test compositions<br>
containing, e.g. different concentrations of particles of any given size(s) or size range(s),<br>
to which the polymer(s) have been conjugated, e.g., under a series of conditions, such as<br>
the extent of pre-treatment of the polymer or the particle core or the time provided for the<br>
conjugation reaction. The rate or degree of inhibition of bacterial attachment to a mouth,<br>
or to an oral cavity model (such as an "artificial mouth"), treated with the compositions<br>
can be assessed by quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis, such as by a colorimetric<br>
technique to assess bacterial accumulation or pellicle formation on hydroxyapatite disks.<br><br><br><br><br>
