A SULPHONAMIDE DERIVATIVES;<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to new sulphonamide derivatives, with the general formula (I), as well as to their physiologically acceptable saits, the processes for their preparation, their application as medicaments in human and/or veterinary therapy and the pharmaceutical compositions that contain them.<br><br>
The new compounds object of the present invention can be used in the pharmaceutical industry as intermediates and for preparing medicaments.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The superfamily of serotonin receptors (5-HT) includes 7 classes (5-HTi-5-HT7) encompassing 14 human subclasses [D. Hoyer, et al., Neuropharmacology, 1997! 36, 419]. The 5-HT6 receptor is the latest serotonin receptor identified by molecular cloning both in rats [F.J. Monsma, et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1993, 43, 320; M. Ruat, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1993, 193, 268] and in humans [R. Kohen, et al., J. Neurochem., 1996, 66, 47]. Compounds with 5-HT6 receptor antagonistic activity are useful for the treatment of various disorders of the Central Nervous System and of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Compounds with 5-HT6 receptor antagonistic activity are useful in the treatment of anxiety, depression and cognitive memory disorders [M. Yoshioka, et al., Ann, NY Acad Sci., 1998, 861, 244; A. Bourson, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. , 1998, 125, 1562; D.C. Rogers, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. SuppL, 1999, 127, 22P; A. Bourson, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then , 1995, 274, 173; A.J. Sleight, et al., Behav, Brain Res. ,<br><br>

1996, 73, 245; T.A. Branchek, et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol, , 2000, 40, 319; C. Routledge, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. , 2000, 130, 1606]. It has been shown that typical and;atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia have a high affinity for 5-HT6 receptors [B.L Roth, et al., J. Pharmacol. Bxp. Ther. , 1994, 268, 1403; C.E. Glatt, et al., Mol. Med. , 1995, 1, 398; F.J. Mosma, et a!., Mol. Pharmacol. , 1993, 43, 320; T. Shinkai, et al.. Am. J. Med. Genet , 1999, 88, 120]. Compounds with 5-HT6 receptor antagonistic activity are useful for treating infantile hyperkinesia (ADHD, attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder) [W.D. Hirst, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. , 2000, 730, 1597; C. Gerard, et al., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207; M.R. Pranzatelli, Drugs of Today, 1997, 33, 379]. Patent application WO 01/32646 describes sulphonamides derived from bicycles, with 6 members each, aromatic or heteroaromatic with 5-HT6 receptor antagonistic activity. Patent application EP 0733628 describes sulphonamides derived from indole with an 5-HTiF receptor antagonistic activity useful for treating migraines. In general, the study of the scientific literature and patents indicates that small structural variations give rise to agonist or antagonist compounds of various receptors of serotonin that are useful for treating different diseases, depending on the receptor for which they show affinity.<br>
After laborious research the inventors have managed to synthesize new compounds with the general formula (I) that show interesting biological properties making them particularly useful for use in human and/or veterinary therapy.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS BINDING TO SEROTONIN RECEPTOR 5HT6<br>
Cell membranes of HEK-293 cells expressing the recombinant human 5HT6 receptor were supplied by Receptor Biology. In said membranes the receptor concentration is 2.18 pmol/mg protein and the protein concentration is 9.17 mg/ml. The experimental protocol follows the method of B. L. Roth et al. [B. L. Roth, S. C. Craigo, M. S. Choudhary, A. Uluer, F. J. Monsrna, Y. Shen, H. Y. Meltzer, D. R. Sibley: Binding of Typical and Atypical Antipsychotic Agents to 5-Hydroxytryptamine-6 and Hydroxytriptamine-7 Receptors. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, 1403] with slight changes. The commercial membrane is diluted (1:40 dilution) with the binding buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). The radioligand used is [3H]-LSD at a concentration of 2.7 nM with a final volume of 200 ul. incubation is initiated by adding 100 ul of membrane suspension, (" 22.9 ug membrane protein), and is prolonged for 60 minutes at a temperature of 37° C. The incubation is ended by fast filtration in a Brandel Cell Harvester through fiber glass filters made by Schleicher &amp; Schuell GF 3362 pretreated with a solution of polyethylenimine at 0.5 %. The filters are washed three times with three milliliters of buffer Tris-HCI 50 mM pH 7.4. The filters are transferred to flasks and 5 ml of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail are added to each flask. The flasks are allowed to reach equilibrium for several hours before counting with a Wallac Winspectral 1414 scintillation counter. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 100 uM of serotonin. Tests were made in triplicate. The inhibition constants (Kj, nM) were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using the program EBDA/LIGAND [Munson and Rodbard, Analytical Biochemistry, 1980, 107, 220]. The following table shows binding results for some of the compounds object of the present invention.<br><br>
