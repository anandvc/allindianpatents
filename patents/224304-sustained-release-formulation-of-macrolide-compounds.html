DESCRIPTION Sustained Release Preparations TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation containing a macrolide compound and being endowed with an ability of an extremely excellent sustained-release, for use in a medical field.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An oral formulation of one of macrolide compounds, namely tacrolimus with an useful immunosuppressive activity, has been prepared as a solid dispersion compositions, which possesses a rapid-release characterization by using polymers such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and disintegrator (see for example EP 0 240 773) . Owing to the presence of disintegrator therein, it is a rapid-release formulation. It has been appraised highly in clinical field owing to its high absorbability. In clinical practice, alternatively, the emergence of an oral tacrolimus formulation with a sufficient long action and excellent oral absorbability has been expected. However, it is the state of the art for a person skilled in the art that the absorbability of a pharmaceutically active agent given orally in a manner as sustained-release formulation is generally reduced and/or that a non-negligible variation of the absorbability is observed.  The inventors of the invention have<br><br>
carried out a lot of investigations. Consequently, the inventors have invented sustained-release formulations of macrolide compounds, the representative of which is tacrolimus, characterized in that macrolide compound is excellently absorbed orally and/or that variation of its absorbability is suppressed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sustained-release formulation of a macrolide compound, wherein the dissolution of the macrolide compound is under sustained release.<br>
It is an. object of the invention to provide a sustained-release formulation of a macrolide compound, wherein the time (T63.2%) required for 63.2 % of the maximum amount of macrolide compound to be dissolved is 0.7 to 15 hours, as measured according to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the 13-th edition. Dissolution Test, No. 2 (Puddle method, 50 rpm) using a test solution which is an aqueous 0.005 % hydroxypropyl cellulose solution, adjusted to pH 4.5.<br>
It is the other object of the invention to provide a solid dispersion composition of a macrolide compound usable in the sustained-release formulation mentioned above, wherein the macrolide compound is present as an amorphous state in a solid base.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide<br><br>
a fine powder of a macrolide compound characterized by a<br>
particle diameter distribution within the range of 0.1-50<br>
Mm and/or a mean particle diameter within the range of<br>
0.2-20 Mm for use in the above-mentioned sustained -release<br>
formulation.<br>
The T63.2% value as determined by the dissolution test<br>
in accordance with this invention can be estimated from the<br>
release curve constructed by plotting test data on graph<br>
paper-  However, the release profile of a drug can be<br>
generally analyzed by fitting dissolution test data to a<br>
release model and such a method can also be used in the<br>
computation of said T63.2% value.  The model for fitting<br>
which can be used includes the first-order or linear model,<br>
zero-order model, cube-root model, etc. as described in<br>
Yamaoka,   K.   &amp;   Yagahara,   Y.:   Introduction   to<br>
Pharmacokinetics with a Microcomputer, Nankodo, p.138 but<br>
as a model by which all kinds of release patterns can be<br>
expressed with the highest validity, there is known Weibull<br>
function, which is described in the above book and L. J.<br>
Leeson &amp; J. T. Carstensen (ed.): Release of Pharmaceutical<br>
Products (American Pharmaceutical Society) (Chizin Shokan),<br>
p.192-195.<br>
Weibull  function  is  a  function  such  that  the<br>
dissolution rate (%) in time (T) can be expressed by the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
Dissolution rate (%) == Dmax x {1-exp [-( (T-T1) )/m j where Dmax represents the maximum dissolution rate at infinite time, m is a scale parameter representing the dissolution velocity, n is a shape parameter representing the shape of the dissolution curve, Ti is a position parameter representing the lag time till start of dissolution, and the dissolution characteristic of a pharmaceutical product can be expressed by using those parameters in combination.<br>
In order to fit dissolution test data to Weibull function and calculate the respective parameters, the nonlinear least square method described in Yamaoka, K. &amp; Yagahara, Y.: Introduction to Pharmacokinetics with a Microcomputer, Nankodo, p.40, mentioned above, is used. More particularly, the parameters are determined at the point of time where the sum of the squares of differences between the values calculated by the above equation and the measured values at each point of time is minimal and the dissolution curve calculated by means of the above equation using those parameters is the curve which dose most faithfully represent the measured values.<br>
The meaning of each parameter of Weibull function is now explained.<br>
Dmax (maximum dissolution rate) is the maximum dissolution rate at infinity of time as mentioned above and<br><br>
generally the value of Dmax is preferably as close to 100 (%) as possible.<br>
m (scale parameter) is a parameter representing the dissolution velocity of a pharmaceutical product, and the smaller the value of m is, the higher is the dissolution velocity and similarly the larger the value of m is, the lower is the dissolution velocity.<br>
n (shape parameter) is a parameter representing the shape of a dissolution curve. When the value of n is 1, Weibull function can be written as dissolution rate (%) = Dmax x {1-exp [-(T-Ti)/m] } , and since this is equivalent to first-border kinetics, the dissolution curve is linear. When the value of n is smaller than 1, the dissolution curve plateaus off. When the value of n is larger than 1, a sigmoid dissolution curve prevails,      <br>
Ti (position parameter) is a parameter representing the lag time till start of dissolution.<br>
The sustained-release formulation comprising a macrolide compound according to this invention can also be characterized by means of said Weibull function. Thus, the objective sustained-release formulation can be implemented<br>
by setting Dmax  (maximum dissolution rate) at 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, m (scale parameter) at 0.7-20, preferably 1-12, more preferably 1.5-8, n (shape parameter) at 0.2-5, preferably 0.3-3, more<br><br>
preferably 0.5-1.5, and Ti (position parameter) at 0-12, preferably O'-S, and more preferably 0-4,<br>
The value found by substituting the parameter values of m and n from the above Weibull function into the term m  represents the time in which 63 . 2% of the maximum amount of dissolution of the active ingredient is released from the formulation (T63.2%).  That is to say, T63.2% (hr) = m ^.  The release characteristic of the sustained-release formulation of this invention can be evaluated by the Dissolution Test, Method 2 (Paddle method, 50 rpm) of JP XIII using a test solution which is 0.005% aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl cellulose adjusted at pH 4.5.  In the sustained-release formulation comprising a macrolide compound according to this invention, the time(T63.2%) in which 63.2% of the maximum amount of the macrolide compound to be dissolved is released from the formulation  is 0.7-15 hours. In the past, though the rapid-release formulation comprising macrolide compound has already been produced, any sustained-release formulations, T63.2% of which is 0.7-15 hours and which are quite useful in clinical practice, have never been produced. The present invention completed it for the first time.  If the T63.2% value is shorter than 0.7 hour, the efficacy of the macrolide compound following oral administration will not be sufficiently sustained. When the formulation has a T63.2% value of more than 15 hours,<br><br>
the release of the active ingredient will be so retarded that the active ingredient will be eliminated from the body before the effective blood concentration is reached, thus being unsuited as the formulation of this invention. When T63.2% is 1.0-12 hours, a more favorable sustained-release can be achieved. More preferably, T63.2% is 1.3-8,2 hours, and the most preferred is a sustained-release formulation with a T63.2% value of 2-5 hours.<br>

the invention is the generic name of compounds with 12 members<br>
or more, which belong to large-ring lactones. Abundant<br>

When preparing the solid dispersion composition of the present invention, the above solid base, such as water-soluble base and water-insoluble base, may be usable by singly or in combination thereof. In case the water-insoluble base is addopted as the solid base in the present invention, suitable dissolution profile of the solid dispersion composition can be achieved by mixing a suitable amount of water-soluble base, such as water-soluble polymer (e.g., HPMC). If desired, other than the solid base described above, suitable excipients (lactose, etc.), binders, coloring agents, sweeteners, flavor, diluents, antioxidants (vitamin E, etc.) and lubricants (for example, synthetic aluminium silicate, magnesium stearate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium stearate, talc, etc.) for common use, are added to prepare a solid dispersion composition.<br>
Depending on the type of the solid base, additionally, the dissolution rate of the macrolide compound from the solid dispersion composition is sometimes too slow or the initial dissolution rate thereof is sometimes required to be elevated. In that case, the dissolution rate of the macrolide compound<br><br>
from the solid dispersion composition can be adjusted, by adding appropriate disintegrators [for example, cross carmelose sodium (CC-Na) , carboxymethyl cellulose calcium (CM-Ca) , lowly substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC) , starch sodium glycolate, micro-fine crystal cellulose, cross povidone, etc.] or appropriate surfactants [for example, hardened polyoxyethylene castor oil, polyoxyl stearate 40, polysorbate 80, sodium lauryl sulfate, sucrose fatty acid ester (HLB is more than 10), etc] to the solid dispersion composition. When the solid base is a water-soluble base, however, the solid dispersion composition preferably does not substantially contain any disintegrator when preparing the sustained-release formulation of the present invention.<br>
The particle size of the solid dispersion composition where the macrolide compound is present as an amorphous state in the solid base is preferably equal to or smaller than 500 ^m. More preferably, the composition is of a particle size passing through a 350-|Am , most preferably 250-jxm sieve.<br>
Furthermore, the solid dispersion composition of a macrolide compound comprised in the sustained-release formulation in accordance with the invention can be produced by methods described in EP 0 240 773 and WO 91/19495 and the like; the methods are more specifically described below.<br>
The macrolide compound is dissolved in an organic solvent<br><br>
(for example, ethanol, dichloromethane or an aqueous mixture thereof, etc.)/ followed by addition of an appropriate amount of a solid base, and the resulting mixture is sufficiently dissolved or suspended together or is allowed to swell. Then, the mixture is sufficiently kneaded together. After removing the organic solvent from the mixture, the residue is dried and ground and is then subjected to size reduction, whereby a solid dispersion composition can be prepared, where the macrolide compound is present as an amorphous state in the solid base. During the kneading process, furthermore, lubricants such as calcium hydrogen phosphate, excipients such as lactose, and the like can further be added to the mixture, if necessary.<br>
The sustained-release formulation comprising a macrolide compound in accordance with this invention can also be manufactured by using a finely divided powder of the macrolide compound. The particle size control of the macrolide compound can be effected by means of milling machinery which is of routine use in pharmaceutical industry, such as a pin mill, hammer mill, jet mill, and dry or wet ball-mi 11, to name but a few examples. The macrolide compound fine powder should have a particle diameter distribution within the range of 0.1--50 u m, preferably 0.2--20 Mm, and more preferably 0.5-10 ju m, and/or a mean particle diameter of 0.2-20 Mm, preferably<br><br>
0.5-10 Mm, and more preferably l-5.<br>
The dispersion solid composition and the fine powder of the macrolide compound, thus produced by the above methods, can be used as such as a sustained-release formulation. Taking account of handleability as a formulation, dispersibility in water, and dispersibility after oral dosing, the composition is more preferably prepared as a sustained-release formulation in a form of powder, fine powder, granule, tablet or capsule by routine formulation methods (e.g., compression molding).<br>
If desired, then, the sustained-release formulation can be prepared by mixing the solid dispersion composition or fine powder of macrolide compounds, with, for example, diluents or lubricants (such as sucrose, lactose, starch, crystal cellulose, synthetic aluminium silicate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, and talc) and/or coloring agents, sweeteners, flavor and disintegrators for routine use. The resulting mixture is then thoroughly mixed together to prepare a sustained-release formulation. The sustained-release formulation, or the solid dispersion composition or fine powder of macrolide compound of the present invention can be preliminarily dispersed in water and juice, to be orally given as a liquid formulation.<br><br>
0.5 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, and 500<br>
The effective dose of the macrolide compound varies, depending on the type of the compound, the age of a patient, his (her) disease, the severity thereof, or other factors. Generally, the effective ingredient is used at a dose of about 0.001 to 1,000 mg, preferably 0.01 to 500 mg, more preferably 0.1 to 100 mg per day for the therapeutic treatment of the disease; generally, a mean single dose is about 0.01 mg, 0.1 mg, mg.<br>
After oral administration, the sustained-release formulation of the macrolide compound in accordance with the invention characteristically releases the macrolide compound in a sustained manner and the pharmaceutical activity maintains for a long period. In accordance with this invention, the frequency of administration of pharmacologically active macrolide compounds can be decreased. More particularly, it has become possible to provide a macrolide-containing pharmaceutical formulation which may be administered only once a day. Furthermore, it is by now possible to provide a pharmaceutical composition which is free from the risk for undisired effects caused by a transiently excessive concentration and insures an expression of pharmacological efficacy over a sufficiently extended period of time.<br><br>

In addition, the said tricyclic macrolides have liver regenerating activity and/or activities of stimulating hypertrophy and hyperplasia of hepatocytes. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful for increasing the effect of the therapy and/or prophylaxis of liver diseases [e.g. immunogenic diseases (e.g. chronic autoimmune liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatic diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis), partial liver resection, acute liver necrosis (e.g. necrosis caused by toxins, viral hepatitis, shock, or anoxia), hepatitis B, non-A non-B hepatitis, hepatocirrhosis, and hepatic failure (e.g. fulminant hepatitis, late-onset hepatitis and "acute-on-chronic" liver failure (acute liver failure on chronic liver diseases))] .<br>
And further, the present composition is also useful for increasing the effect of the prevention and/or treatment of various diseases because of the useful pharmacological activity of the said tricyclic macrolides, such as augmenting activity of chemotherapeutic effect, activity of cytomegalovirus infection, anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting activity against peptidyl-prolyl isomerase or rotamase^ antimalarial activity^ antitumor activity^ and so on.<br><br>
This invention further provides a dissolution test method for a solid formulation comprising macrolide compound, which uses a test solution containing a suitable amount of cellulose polymer. In general, the dissolution test for testing a release characteristic of a medicinally active ingredient dissolved from a solid formulation containing it is carried out in accordance with Dissolution Test, Method 2 (Paddle method, 50 rpm), JP XIII, or Dissolution Test shown in USP 23, NF18 or in European Pharmacopoeia (3rd edition).  However, in conducting a dissolution test as to a formulation containing a small amount of a macrolide compound, the release of the macrolide compound based on the intrinsic content thereof may not reach 100% even after several hours.  This is because, when the amount of the macrolide compound is small, adsorption of the macrolide compound on surfaces of the test vessel, filter, etc. will exert an influence of increased magnitude . After much investigation, the present inventors found that by adding a suitable amount of cellulose polymer (such as, HPMC, hydroxypropylcellulose phthaiate, MC, CMC-Na, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) , and so on) to the test solution and by, if necessary, adding phosphoric acid or the like to the test solution so as to bring its pH to not higher than 7 in order to avoid the adverse effect of the consequent increase in pH on the<br><br>
stability of the macrolide compound, the influence of adsorption of the macrolide compound on surfaces of the test apparatus can be inhibited to achieve a recovery rate of substantially 100%. Preferable cellulose polymer is hydroxypropyl cellulose or its equivalent, the preferable viscosity of which is such that when its 5.0 g is dissolved in 95 ml of water, and after centrifugation to remove the foam where necessary, the viscosity of the solution is<br>
measured with a rotary viscometer at25±0-l°C, the solution shows a viscosity of 75-150 cps.  For example, the hydroxypropyl cellulose with an average molecular weight of about 100,000 as available from Aldrich corresponds thereto.<br>
The "suitable amount" of cellulose polymer to be added to the test solution is 0.001-0.1%, preferably 0,002-0.01%, and most preferably 0.005%, all based on the total amount of the test solution.<br>
Dissolution Test, Method 2 (Paddle method), JP XIII, and dissolution test shown in USP 23, NF18 or in European Pharmacopoeia (3rd edition) are well-known methods for testing the release kinetics of the active ingredient from a solid pharmaceutical product. They are dissolution tests using the specified vessel, paddle and other hardware, with controlling quantity of test solution, temperature of test solution, rotational speed, and other conditions.<br><br>
Where necessary, the test is performed with the test solution adjusted to a suitable pH. In the present invention, pH is preferably not higher than 7 . In the present invention, "Dissolution Test, Method 2 (Paddle method, 50 rpm), JP XIII" means 'Dissolution Test, Method 2 (Paddle method), JP XIII, which is carried out with stirring 50 revolutions per minute. The corresponding descriptions in JP XIII, USP 23 (NF18) and European Pharinacopoeia (3rd edition) is incorporated in this specification by reference.<br>

Example 31<br>
Dissolution test Test sample:<br><br>
(1)	Formulations A and C, which were prepared in Examples<br>
mentioned before.<br>
(2)	Control formulation (rapid-release formulation),<br>
which is 1 mg capsule formulation comprising the<br>
following ingredients. It is prepared, in a similar<br>
manner to that of Examples 1 and 2 of WO 91/19495, by<br>
mixing ingredients (e) and (f) with the solid dispersion<br>
composition composed of the following ingredients (a)<br>
to (d), and by being encapsulated.<br>
(a)	tacrolimus (FK506)	1 mg<br>
(b)	hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose      1 mg<br>
(c)	lactose	2 mg<br>
(d)	cross carmelose sodium	1 mg<br>
(e)	lactose	59.35 mg<br>
(f)	magnesium stearate	0.65 mg,<br>
Test method:<br>
According to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the 13-edition, Dissolution Test, No. 2 (Puddle method, 50 rpm) using an aqueous 0.005 % hydroxypropyl cellulose solution, adjusted to pH 4.5 as a test solution, a test was conducted. The obtained data were shown in the following.<br><br><br><br>
Example 32<br>
In a similar manner to that of Example 31, dissolution test was carried out. And thereby various parameters in Weibull function and T63.2% were obtained by calculation.<br><br><br><br>
Example 33<br>
Oral absorbability<br>
Test sample:<br>
(1)	Formulations B and D, which were prepared in the<br>
Examples mentioned before.<br>
(2)	Control formulation (the same as the control in Example<br>
31)<br>
Test Method:<br>
The test samples were orally given to 6 cynomologus monkeys (at 1 mg/monkey as an FK506 dose), to assay the blood FK506 concentration after administration. Seventeen hours prior to the administration, feeds were withdrawn from a feed table for cynomologus monkeys of body weights around 6 kg. Then, the animals were starved until 12 hours passed after the administration. Water was fed ad libitum prior to the initiation of the test throughout the administration of the test samples and thereafter.  At the dosing, water (20 ml) was<br><br>
simultaneously given to the animals. At predetermined intervals after dosing, 1 ml of blood was drawn from the forearm vein by using a sterile syringe into a plastic tube containing heparin and stored at about -80 °C until the assay of the drug concentration started. The whole blood drug concentration of FK506 was assayed by the FK506-specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) known in JP-A-1-92659. The disclosure thereof is cited herein and encompassed within the description of the specification.<br><br>
The maximum blood concentration (Cmax) is defined as the maximum value of the whole blood drug. Tmax is the time required for reaching the maximum blood concentration. MRT is defined as the mean retention time. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUG) was calculated by the trapezoid method.  And as an indicator of the variation of oral<br><br>
absorbability,  CV  (standard  deviation/mean  in  %)  was calculated.<br><br>
Example 34<br>
According to a similar manner to that of Example 33, the oral absorbability of the various formulations of the present invention was carried out.<br><br><br><br>
The above results show that the formulations adopted in the above experiments, after oral administration, have smaller Cmax, sufficiently prolonged Tmax and MRT than those of the rapid-release formulation (control). And compared with the rapid-release formulation, AUG shown by the above formulations are almost the same or more. Or the above sustained-release formulations have small variations in individuals of Cmax and/or AUC^ compared with a rapid-release formulation.<br>
In accordance with the invention of the present application, the small variation in individuals of the maximum blood concentration or area under the blood concentration time curve of the macrolide compound after oral dosing, compared with a rapid release formulation thereof can be determined, by using an indicator of the variation of the blood absorbability of the macrolide compound, namely standard deviation/mean (CV in %)of<br><br>
the maximum blood concentration or the area under the blood concentration time curve. The term "small variation" means a small CV value thereof; more specifically, the term means that the CV value is smaller than that of a rapid release formulation as described above.<br>
The disclosure of the patents, patent application and references cited herein in the application is encompassed within the description of the specification.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
