				<td>A NOVEL HERBAL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
(The present invention relates to a novel herbal composition for the treatment of cancer. The present invention particularly relates to an herbal formulation comprising mixture of lignans isolated from the plantfCedrus Deodara.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Cancer or neoplasm is the malignant new growth anywhere and elsewhere in the body system. It is characterized by unregulated proliferation of cells and a growing public health problem whose estimated worldwide new incidence is about six million cases per yeayln most of the countries, cancer is second only to heart disease as cause of death. It can arise in any organ of the body but some sites are prone to attack than others such as breast, throat, intestine, leukocytes etc. Each cancer is propagated from a single cell that cut at some stage, it becomes free from its territorial restraints, which form a family of cells that multiply without limits and appear in the form of tumors.<br>
During the transition from normal cell to a tumor cell a profound and heritable change occurs which allows a tumor cell to determine its own activities largely irrespective of the laws that govern so precisely the growth of all normal cells in an organism. This newly acquired property, which is known as autonomy, is the most important single characteristic of tumor cells since without it there would be no tumors. Another distinguishing characteristic of tumor cells is their lack of perfect form of function. The differences that exist between cancer and normal cells are that, compared to normal cells, cancer cells have a) low pH b) greater free radical character c) tumor produced hormone peptides d) tumor associated antigens e) lower calcium ion and higher potassium ion concentration f) different potassium isotope ratios g) elevated amounts of methylated nucleotides h) higher concentrations of plasma raicroproteins and mucopolysacharides i) greater need of exogenous zinc and j) high biowater content.<br>
Many of the gross causes of cancer, such as dietary, environmental, occupational exposure to certain chemical substances or forms of electromagnetic radiation, have been elucidated through epidemiological studies. It is imperative, therefore, that they be identified and eliminated from the environment in so far as that is possible in modern industrial societies. In the annals of therapy, a quest to conquer, the impasse of cancer has been always fascinated by and large all disciplines of scientific community, especially natural product<br>
chemists. In 19th and 20th century, lot of research work has been carried out to find out the driving force behind this dreadful disease as well as large number of drugs have been introduced to counter its menace.<br>
It is worthwhile at this juncture to look briefly at a few most powerful chemotherapeutic agents, which have been of paramount importance to the mankind and also to the researchers who have been actively involved in the synthesis and isolation of anticancer drugs. Lignans have been isolated from a number of plants(Achenbach, H., Waibel, R. and Meusah, I. Phytochemistry, 22 (3), 749-753 (1983); Nishibe, S., Hisada, S. and Inagaki, I. Phytochemistry, 10, 2231-2232 (1971); Barrero, A. F., Haidour, A. and Dorado, M. M. J. Nat. Prod. 42,159-162(1979)).<br>
Recent studies on the biological activities of lignans prove beyond doubt the efficacy of these phytochemicals as cytotoxic agents (Macrae, W. D. and Towers, G. H. N. Phytochemistry 23 (6), 1207-1220 (1984)). Also recently lignans have been isolated from human urine and blood. This fact also suggests that lignans are playing a definite role in human physiology.<br>
With the above background, the applicants have focussed their attention towards the identification and isolation of potent cytotoxic agents from plants. Literature data suggests the presence secoisolariciresinol in Cedrus deodara (Agarwal, P. K. and Rastogi, R. P. Phytochemistry, 21 (6), 1459-1461 (1982)) which is in all likelihood may be an artefact, is a proven antioxidant. Further investigation on Cedrus Deodara carried out by us led us to the isolation of a new lignan mixture comprising essentially (-)- Matairesinol, (-)-Wikshtronol and Dibenzyl butyrolactol in an extremely significant yield, Cedrus deodara is also a new source for these lignans.<br>
(-)-Wikstromol was first reported from wikstroemia viridiflora (Nishibe, S., Hisada, S. and Inagaki, I. Phytochemistry, 10, 2231-2232 (1971)). Matairesinol was isolated from a number of sources before (Nishibe, S., Hisada, S. and Inagaki, I. Phytochemistry, 10, 2231-2232 (1971); Tandon, S. and Rastogi, R. P. Phytochemistry, 15, 1789-1791 (1976)). The isolation of the dibenzylbutyrolactol [4,4',9-trihydroxy-3,3l-dimethoxy-9,9'-epoxy lignan] was reported only once previously from the wood of Abies pinsapo (Barrero, A. F., Haidour, A. and Dorado, M. M. J. Nat. Prod. 42,159-162 (1979)).<br>
Keeping in mind the high yields of the lignans from Cedrus deodara and also the excellent biological activities and lignans in general (Macrae, W.D. and Towers, G.H.N. Phytochemistry 23(6), 1207-1220 (1984).<br>

Example-2<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of (-)-matairesinol against human cancer cell lines:<br>
The human cancer cell lines were obtained either from National center for cell science, Pune, India or National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, U. S. A. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium with 2mM glutamine, 100 (ig/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, sterilized by filtration and supplemented with 10% sterilized fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin before use) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator (WTB binder, Germany). The cells at subconfluent stage were harvested from the flask by treatment with trypsiu (0.05% trypsin in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA) and suspended in complete growth medium. Cells with cell viability of more than 97% by trypan blue exclusion technique were used for determination of cytotoxicity.<br>
(-)-Matairesinol was dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) to obtain a stock solution of 20 mg/ml. The stock solution was serially diluted with complete growth medium containing 50ug/ml of gentamycin to obtain three working test solutions of 200, 60 and 20n,g/ml<br>
The suspension of human cancer cell lines of required cell density in complete growth medium was prepared and cell suspension (lOOjil per wall) of each cell line) of 96-welI tissue culture plate. Three additional wells of each cell line were also prepared for control.<br>
Two blank wells for control and each experimental and each experimental set for every cell line were also included that contained equivalent amount of complete growth medium only. The plates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% C02 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator.<br>
The working test solutions of (-)-Matairesinol of different concentrations (100 ul) were added after 24-hours incubation in all the wells including blanks of the experimental set. The equivalent amount of complete growth medium was added to control set. The plates were further incubated for 48-hours (at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% COa and 90% relative humidity hi a carbon dioxide incubator) after addition of test material etc. and then the ceil growth was stopped by gently layering of 50 ul of TCA (50% trichloroacetic acid) on top of the medium in all the wells. The plates were incubated at 4°C for one hour to fix the cells attached to the bottom of the wells. Liquids of all the wells were gently pipetted out and discarded. The plates were washed five times with distilled water to remove TCA, growth medium, low molecular weight metabolites, serum proteins etc. Plates were air-dried.<br>
Cell growth was measured by staining with sulforhodamine B dye (SRB). The SRB solution (100 ul of 0.4% in 1% acetic acid) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The unbound SRB was quickly removed by washing the wells five times with 1-% acetic acid and plates were air-dried. Tris-buffer (100 ul of 0.01 M, pH 10.4) was added to all the wells and plates were gently stirred for 5 minutes on a mechanical stirrer. The optical density was recorded on ELISA reader at 540 run.<br>
The cell growth in presence of test material was determined by subtracting mean OD value of respective blank from the mean OD value of experimental set. Like wise, cell growth in absence of test material (control set) and in presence of positive control was also determined. The per cent cell growth in presence of test material was determined considering the cell growth in absence of test material as 100% and in turn per cent inhibition was calculated.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of (-)-matairesinol was determined against human breast (MCF-7 &amp; ZR-75-1), neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC &amp; EMR-32), cervix (SiHa), colon (Colo-205, HT-29 &amp; SW-620), liver (HEP-2) and lung (A-549) cancer cell lines. The results are summarized in Table-1. (-)-Matairesinol showed dose dependent inhibition of cell growth of the human cancer cell lines studied. The inhibition varied from 54-93% at lOOug/ml. It was most<br>
effective against human colon cancer cell line Colo-205 and least effective against breast cell line MCF-7.<br>
Example-3 In vitro cytotoxicity of (-)-wikstromol against human cancer cell lines:<br>
The human cancer cell lines grown and harvested and cytotoxicity was determined exactly as per example 1 except that the test material used was (-)-wikstromol which was dissolved in DMSO and three working test solutions were prepared of the same concentrations as in example 1.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of (-)-wikstromol was determined against human breast (MCF-7 &amp; ZR-75-1), neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC &amp; IMR-32), cervix (SiHa), colon (Colo-205, HT-29 &amp; SW-620), liver (HEP-2) and lung (A-549) cancer cell lines. The results are summarized in Table-1. (-)-wikstromol showed dose dependent inhibition of cell growth of the human cancer cell lines studied. The inhibition varied from 32-67% at 100 ug/ml. It was most effective against human colon cancer cell line Colo-205 and least effective against colon cell line HT-29.<br>
Example-4<br>
A process for the isolation of novel chemical composition containing lignan mixture from Cedrus Deodara.<br>
The dried wood powder of Cedus deodara was loaded (200 g.) in a soxhlet apparatus. The powder was first extracted with hexane and followed by chloroform. The chloroform extract concentrated under vacuum. The thick syrupy residue was dissolved in ethylacetate (for about 50g. of residue around 60 ml. of ethyl acetate). The solution of residue in ethyl acetate was added drop wise to hexane (around 5L.). The solid separated was filtered off. Yield of lignan mixture is around 20g.<br>
The composition of lignan mixture was assayed by HPLC for three batches and the results are summarized in Table-2. Column used for HPLC is ODS, 1 .5ml flow rate at 225nm wavelength.<br>
Example-5<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of lignan mixtures isolated from Cedrus deodara against human cancer cell lines:<br>
The human cancer cell lines grown and harvested and cytotoxicity was determined exactly as per example 1 except that the test material used was three lignan mixtures isolated from Cedrus deodara, which were dissolved in separately in DMSO and three working test solutions were prepared of the same concentrations as in example 1.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity of the three lignan mixtures obtained from three batches whose compositions are shown in Table-2 was determined against breast (MCF-7 &amp; T-47-D), cervix (Hela &amp; SiHa), neuroblastoma (SF-539, SK-N-MC, IMR-32, SK-N-SH &amp; SNB-78), colon (Colo-205, HCT-15, HT-29 &amp; SW-620), liver (HEP-2 &amp; HEP-G-2), lung (A-549, HOP-18 &amp; NCI-H23), oral (KB), ovary (Nffl-OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5 &amp; SK-OV-3) and prostate (DU-145 &amp; PC-3). The results are summarized in Table-3. Lignan mixture showed dose dependent inhibition of cell growth of the human cancer cell lines studied. All the three mixtures showed more or less the similar pattern of activity. The inhibition varied from 37 to 100% at 100 (ig/ml.
