				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The Invention relates in general to Embedded System Field for electronic devices such as MFP, Printers, Mobile device etc. Further, this invention relates to authentication procedures in such devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method which enables the user to enter the email id / host name in the MFP device in much less time.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
US 6,591,117 describe a Mobile communication terminal with multi-function key. This invention explains a mobile communication terminal with a multi-function key which serves as both a store key and a recall key. The mobile communication terminal includes a multi-function key; a memory for storing, in a function allocation table, input conditions of the multi-function key and corresponding functions for the respective input conditions; and a controller for determining a function of the multi-function key based on the function allocation table, when the multi-function key is pressed according to a given input condition. Further, the mobile communication terminal includes a memory for storing messages for informing a user about the determined function, and a display for displaying a message for informing the user of the determined function. The controller includes a flag, and sets the flag according to the function determined for the multi-function key.<br>
US 5,528,235 describe a Multi-status multi-function data processing key and key array. This invention explains a multi-status data entry key and keyboard capable of a one-to-one correspondence between each key status and a pre-assigned signal or state, with the neutral position or status being one of the states. Each non-neutral key status is associated with a unique pre-determined signal and corresponds uniquely to a specific symbol function or operation. The implementation of this keypad in telephones, computers, cash registers and other devices is shown. Its implementation in telephones is extensively covered.<br>
There are a number of electronic devices which need user inputs for network configuration, email address input etc. As per existing scenario while entering email address, user has to enter full email id (one by one character) using the keyboard. The display and keyboard drivers along with the user interface are instrumental for this action.<br>
Figure 1 explains a block diagram for existing system. In present scenario the electronic devices like Printers, MFP or mobile etc. have keyboards and an LCD display unit for providing user interface support to the device. A user interface task is always required to be running and as soon as it gets some message from key board driver it has to send the required display message to LCD driver (Display Driver) and is also required to send the message to some another task for providing user input functionality like scan to email, copy, Fax etc. The user is required to enter all the characters one by one on keyboard for displaying them on LCD panel. In the existing scenario while configuring host name of network device or while entering email address in any application e.g. Scan to Email etc, user has to enter all the characters one by one. There is no fast method available in order that the time for entering the same can be reduced. The time taken for the user to enter the host name, email id etc is high in the existing methods and there is ample chance for the user to commit typing errors.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is therefore to evolve a method which enables the user of the MFP device to enter the host name / email id in much less time.<br>
It is another object of the invention to evolve a method for entry of email id / host name which can be implemented with the existing key providing multiple functions or with just an additional key.<br>
It is another object of the invention to help the user towards reduction of typing errors and time taken for entry of email id / host name through keyboard.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the user to enter the host name, email id etc with the help of key having multiple functions.<br>
The invention is to provide the support for entering the full server name (e.g. hotmail, yahoo, Samsung.com etc) in one key hit on keyboard. For providing the same support the manufacturer can use the existing key with multifunction support (e.g. @ key) or can provide one additional key on keyboard for the same. This invention also provides the user to enter the domain names easily.<br>
The keyboard panels provided on some of the devices like Mobile, Printer or MFP or Facsimile devices are very cumbersome for typing an English alphabet, due to the fact that some devices have minimal set of keys in which the user needs to enter the alphabets. In case if there is a device which needs the user to enter the domain names which are used quite often, they can be added in the list and can be used for future use.<br>
This invention explains a method of providing fast data input support to the user by providing multifunction support to an existing key or an additional key for entering the hostname /company name/email id in an MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	receiving a user message using a user interface track;<br>
(b)	storing the hostname /company name/email id in a global array;<br>
(c)	updating the said global array with hostname /company name/email id from the configurable menu provided by user interface;<br>
(d)	updating the global array from HTTP page using another receiver task;<br>
(e)	writing full hostname /company name/email id by hitting the said key; and<br>
(f)	selecting the displayed string by pressing enter key once the required information is the one displayed from the configured global array, wherein the user interface task will operate as per existing design with one additional key trap to provide fast data input for hostname /company name/email id.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the invention given as a non-restrictive example only and represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows the Block Diagram for existing system. Figure 2 shows the Block Diagram for Invention system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram for the present Invention. There will always be a user interface task for receiving user messages. The user interface task will operate as per existing design with one additional key trap to provide fast data input for server name or company names. The task will also update the global array with company or server names from the configurable menu provided by user interface. There will also be another receiver task which will help to update the global array from HTTP page. There will be two cases one for using the existing key or other for using the separate key for writing full name in one key hit. The user interface task will always keep a track for hitting the key. If the user presses the specified key first time then the cursor will blink below the first char of the string and if the user presses same key consecutively then the string will keep changing with different company names as configured in global array. Once the user press enters then that displayed string will get selected and the operation will proceed.<br>
The invention is explained with respect to a key This invention can be employed using any key and is not a limiting factor .The invention is to provide multi use of the key support on keyboard for providing fast data input support to the user. If the user presses '@' key once then it will display on LCD panel. If the user presses '@' key twice (Consecutively) then the display will be '@companyname1 .com'. If the user presses @ key thrice (Consecutively) then it will display '.companyname1.com' and if the user presses  @' key fourth time (Consecutively) then it will display '@companyname2.com etc. The company names will be configurable from both LCD based user interface and web based user interface by System Administrator. We can also provide one new key in the key board itself for providing above functionality instead of using key. There will always be a user interface task for receiving user messages. The user interface task will operate as per existing design with one additional key trap to provide fast data input for server name or company names. The task will also update the global array with company or server names from the configurable menu provided by user interface. There will also be another receiver task which will help to update the global array from HTTP page. There will be two cases, one for using the existing key and the other for using separate key for writing full name upon hitting a single key. The user interface task will always keep a track key sequence. If the user presses the specified key first time then the cursor will blink below the first char of the string and if the user presses same key consecutively then the string will keep changing with different company names as configured in global array. Once the user presses ' enter' then that displayed string will get selected and the operation will proceed.<br>
• The System administrator can directly configure some frequently used server addresses like 'hotmail.com', 'yahoo.com', Samsung.com, rediffmail.com etc which will help to the user in reducing the typing error as the number of characters need to be typed gets reduced.<br>
