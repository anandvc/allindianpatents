				<td>MULTI- USER REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE<br>
This invention relates to a multi-user remote control device.<br>
Devices are known for remotely controlling equipment of any type<br>
(lights, curtains, doors, household electrical appliances, roll shutters, alarms,<br>
etc.) either for reasons of comfort or to avoid the need for cables which<br>
besides being laborious to install are inflexible and difficult to modify.<br>
The general principle on which a remote control device is based, is to<br>
use a fixed signal receiver associated with the user device to be controlled,<br>
and a portable transmitter tuned to the receiver and able to transmit control<br>
signals thereto.<br>
	The known remote control devices differ on the basis of the type of<br>
signals used, and are divided essentially into remote control devices using<br>
radio (RF) signals and remote control devices using infrared (IR) signals.<br>
Radio signals are more advantageous in terms of penetrability, they<br>
being able to reach the receiver even if not visible, and in particular if it is<br>
housed inside the equipment to be controlled. At the same time, radio signals<br>
also have limits, such as the risk of disturbing other radio signals, the risk of<br>
transmitting undesired commands to other user devices, the need to use a<br>
number of channels equal to the number of user devices to be controlled, etc.<br>
In contrast, infrared signals are insensitive to external disturbances,<br>
they are directional and hence enable several user devices to be controlled<br>
via a single channel even if they are positioned within the same environment,<br>
provided there is sufficient space between them; at the same time they cannot<br>
overcome obstacles and can operate a receiver only if if is visible to the<br>
transmitter.<br><br>
An object of the invention is to eliminate all the drawbacks of IR and<br>
RF remote control devices while at the same time retaining their advantages.<br>
Another object of the invention is to use a normal IR remote controller,<br>
and in particular the remote controller of television receivers, to control a<br>
plurality of user devices, even if situated at a distance and not visible.<br>
In this respect, a remote control device has recently been proposed for<br>
remotely controlling by infrared signals user device which is not visible to<br>
the infrared transmitter. In practice the device, provided for controlling by<br>
means of an IR remote controller an IR receiver associated with the user<br>
device to be controlled (video recorder, satellite receiver, decoder, air<br>
conditioner, etc.) requires that between the IR transmitter and the IR receiver<br>
there be interposed a first IR/RF converter positioned within the room from<br>
which the user device is to be controlled, and able to receive infrared signals<br>
from the traditional remote controller and to convert them into radio signals,<br>
and a second RF/IR converter positioned in the room in which the user device<br>
to be controlled exists. The two converters therefore perform the function of<br>
extending by means of radio signals the operabiiity of a normal remote control<br>
device using infrared signals, by partly overcoming the limits of these latter.<br>
However even this known solution presents limits, in that it is<br>
expressly provided for controlling user devices comprising an IR receiver and<br>
is unable to control any of those user devices traditionally constructed to be<br>
controlled by RF signals, such as lights, curtains, alarms and roll shutters, for<br>
which it would be necessary to convert the received infrared signal into an RF<br>
signal for controlling the user device. Consequently a further object of the<br>
invention is to remotely control non-visible user devices by using<br>
radiofrequency control systems.<br><br>
These and further objects which will be apparent from the ensuing<br>
description are attained, according to the invention, by a multi-user remote<br>
control device characterised by comprising : an IR transmitter with a multiple<br>
number n of channels, an IR receiver (12) with n channels tuned to the n<br>
channels of the IR transmitter (2), a microcontroller (14) for controlling the<br>
device, an RF transmitter (18) associated with the IR receiver (12) and provided<br>
with n channels which can be activated via the n connection channels between<br>
said IR transmitter (2) and said IR receiver (12), n RF receivers (6i), each directly<br>
associated with a user device (8i) and tuned to one of the n channels of said RF<br>
transmitter (18).<br>
Some preferred embodiments of the invention are described<br>
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of the remote<br>
control device according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a detailed scheme of the conversion and processing unit;<br>
Figure 3 is a different embodiment of the device according to the invention;<br>
and<br>
Figure 4 shows a particular implementation thereof.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2, the remote control<br>
device according to the invention comprises a portable transmitter 2, a<br>
conversion and processing unit 4 and a plurality of receivers 6i (i = 2, 3, ... n)<br>
associated with corresponding user devices indicated by the reference<br>
numeral 8i.<br><br>
The transmitter 2 is an infrared (IR) signal transmitter with n channels.<br>
It can consist of a traditional remote control device for a television receiver 10<br>
or a similar dedicated device, or a remote control device with a certain number<br>
of keys intended for the television receiver and with other dedicated keys, or<br>
finally a remote control device with a keypad intended for the television<br>
receiver and an additional key for its conversion into a dedicated keypad.<br>
In its basic version the conversion and processing unit 4 comprises:<br>
-	a receiver 12 for IR signals, with n channels tuned to the n channels of the<br>
IR transmitter 2,<br>
-	a microcontroller 14 for controlling the device,<br><br>
-	a non-volatile memory 16 associated with the microcontroller 14, and<br>
-	an RF radio signal transmitter 18 with n channels.<br>
The receivers 6i are n RF signal receivers, tuned to the n channels of<br>
the RF transmitter 18 contained in the conversion and processing unit 4.<br>
With each receiver 6i there is associated a user device 8i to be<br>
controlled, which can consist of a door, a gate, a roll shutter, a curtain, a light,<br>
an alarm, etc.<br>
Some RF receivers 6' may be integrated into the relative user device<br>
8', as represented by the rectangle 6'-8' in Figure 1.<br>
The remote control device of the invention operates in the following<br>
manner.<br>
When the operator wishes to remotely operate for example a gate, he<br>
operates the corresponding key on the remote controller 2 (IR transmitter)<br>
after pointing the remote controller in the direction of the conversion and<br>
processing unit 4.<br>
The encpded IR signal, transmitted by the transmitter 2, is received by<br>
the receiver 12, which by means of the microcontroller 14 converts it into a RF<br>
signal, which is transmitted by the transmitter 18 to the receiver 6i, tuned for<br>
said signal and associated with the operating equipment 8i on thegate.<br>
In this manner, by virtue of this transformation of the IR signal into a<br>
RF signal, the gate operating equipment 8i can be activated even if not visible<br>
from the spot from which the command is transmitted.<br>
If instead the operator wishes to switch on an external light, he has<br>
merely to press the key of the remote controller corresponding to that light, in<br>
order to generate an IR signal, which is received by the IR receiver 12 of the<br>
conversion and processing unit 4. Here the IR signal is converted into a<br><br>
control signal for the transmitter 18, which transmits along the appropriate RF<br>
channel a radio signal able to reach the receiver 6i associated with the light to<br>
be switched on.<br>
As stated, the transmitter 2 can consist of a normal remote controller<br>
for a television receiver 10, in which the control keys can be made to emit IR<br>
signals for this different function by an appropriate key, with which the remote<br>
controller can be provided; alternatively the television receiver remote<br>
controller can be provided not only with the normal keys for controlling the<br>
television receiver, but also with further keys to be used for the purpose of the<br>
invention.<br>
In a different embodiment shown in Figure 3, the conversion and<br>
processing unit 4 is housed in the television receiver and is provided, or<br>
alternatively the television receiver itself is provided, with its own software to<br>
display on the screen of this latter the state of all the user devices under<br>
control. However this function requires that the device of the invention also<br>
comprises, for each user device 8i an additional RF transmitter 20i associated<br>
with the RF receiver 6i and able to generate a signal confirming the reception<br>
of the corresponding activation or deactivation command.<br>
This confirmation signal is received by a receiver 22 provided in the<br>
conversion and processing unit 4.<br>
If software for displaying the state of the user devices 8i on the screen<br>
of the television receiver 10 is not provided, this user state can be displayed<br>
on a panel provided in the unit 4 and separate from the screen of the<br>
television receiver. In this case the unit 4 comprises not only said display<br>
panel but also a circuit 30 for optically and acoustically indicating the state of<br><br>
said user devices. Alternatively, the receiver 22 can be associated with a<br>
modem for remote transmission of the state of user devices 8j.<br>
In a different embodiment, not shown in the drawings, the same<br>
. remote controller 2 as that for the television receiver 10, with the same keys<br>
and same channels, is used to control the different user devices; however in<br>
this case the conversion and processing unit 4 must be disposed in a position<br>
distant from the television receiver, in order to be able to utilize the<br>
directionality of the remote controller to control the television remote 10 or the<br>
other user devices 8i at choice.<br>
Correct operation of the device, and in particular the compatibility of<br>
the remote controller with the conversion and processing unit 4, requires that<br>
this compatibility must be previously established, i.e. that the remote<br>
controller 2 has been recognized by the conversion and processing unit 4 and<br>
is able to dialogue with it.<br>
For this purpose said conversion and processing unit 4 comprises in<br>
its interior a circuit 24 for learning the codes of the different commercial marks<br>
of IR remote controllers, this circuit being selectable with traditional systems<br>
to instruct the unit 4 to dialogue with that remote controller.<br>
The conversion and processing unit 4 must also be able to dialogue<br>
with different receivers 6i and must therefore possess the codes of the various<br>
RF channels. These codes can be individual to the conversion and processing<br>
unit 4, in which case they can activate only RF receivers compatible with<br>
these codes, or alternatively, if they are required to activate RF receivers of<br>
already installed user devices, they must previously learn the codes of the<br>
relative RF channels.<br><br>
For the first eventuality, the conversion and processing unit 4<br>
comprises an encoder 26 able to feed its codes to the RF transmitter 18 when<br>
commanded by the microcontroller 14.<br>
For the second eventuality, the conversion and. processing unit 4<br>
comprises a circuit 28 for learning the codes of the RF remote controllers of<br>
already installed user devices 8i.<br>
As the circuit 28 for learning codes of channels of the RF remote<br>
controller relative to already installed user devices consists essentially of an<br>
RF receiver, this can also perform the function of the receiver 22, i.e. of<br>
receiving the confirmation signals of the activation and deactivation<br>
commands for the different user devices.<br>
From the aforegoing it is apparent that the multi-user remote control<br>
device of the invention is substantially more advantageous that traditional<br>
multi-user remote control devices, whether IR or RF, and in particular:<br>
-	it is practically insensitive to radio disturbances in that the mobile remote<br>
controller 2 uses IR signals while the transmissions using RF signals take<br>
place between fixed equipment, so that appropriate expedients can be used<br>
to reduce interference by external signals to a minimum,<br>
-	a single remote controller can be used for a plurality of user devices, and<br>
this can be made compatible with IR and RF systems practically of any<br>
type.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, shown in Figure 4, each user device<br>
8i, which can be for example a winding motor of a roll shutter, can have its<br>
own associated conversion and processing unit 4, which is positioned in the<br>
room in which the user device is installed. In this manner a simple IR remote<br>
controller provided with only one or two channels can control practically an<br><br>
unlimited number of user devices, by being taken into the various rooms to<br>
operate the roll shutters contained therein.<br>
In a different embodiment not shown in the drawings, the remote<br>
controller 2 comprises not only a plurality of keys associated with n IR<br>
channels, but also one or more keys associated with RF channels, for the<br>
direct transmission of commands to a predetermined number of receivers 6i.<br>
Naturally these keys associated with RF channels can also form part<br>
of a remote controller separate from the remote controller 2 of the television<br>
receiver 10.<br>
In another embodiment, not shown in the drawings, the RF transmitter<br>
20i associated with one or more user devices 8i is able to automatically feed<br>
to the receiver 22 the state of that user device, i.e. independently of the fact<br>
that there has previously been a command by the operator. This embodiment<br>
is advantageous if the user device 8i consists for example of an alarm sensor.<br>
In another embodiment, also not shown in the drawings, the operator<br>
can act directly on the receiver 22 with an RF remote controller. This<br>
embodiment is advantageous if the user device 8i must be able to indicate a<br>
danger or emergency situation (remote assistance).<br><br>
