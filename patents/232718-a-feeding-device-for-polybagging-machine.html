				<td>This invention relates to a feeding device for polybagging machine.<br>
The polybagging machine are as such known in the prior art for producing polybagging having packets arranged therein. The feeding device of such machines comprises a belt conveyor to receive the packets from the discharge end of the packing machine and convey the same to a stack making station of polybagging machine. When the stack of the packet is formed on the first belt conveyor the second belt conveyor starts rotating for conveying the stack packets to the stack push station and wherein the stack of packets is being pushed by a pusher operated by a pneumatic cylinder into the polybagging machine.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the conventional feeding device.<br>
One of the main disadvantage is that the stack of packets is conveyed on a belt conveyor due to friction, but the light weight packets gets disturbed<br>
during the conveying. Also some of the light weight packets are of the irregular shapes like biscuit pouches<br>
and the stack get disturbed because of its interference with guides provided on the conveyor belt.<br>
Therefore  the main object of this  invention is  to provide an improved feeding device for  use  with polybagging  machines which obviates  the  disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to propose a feeding device for polybagging machine  having means  to convey the stack of packets in an  undisturbed position.<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to propose  a  polybagging machine wherein the use  of  the second  conveyor  belt has been  eliminated.   Thus  the operation and speed of the machine has been increased.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a feeding device for polybagging machine comprising a first conveyor belt provided for conveying the packets (P) received from the packaging machine to a stack making station of a polybagging machine, a stack pusher being provided to push the stack onto a base plate characterized in that said base plate having a plurality of channels being provided for guiding the conveyance of the stack of packet to the feeding station (F), finger pusher assembly being provided below said base plate such that to convey the stack of packet (S) to the feeding station, wherein said finger pusher assembly comprises a plurality of finger pusher secured with a first bracket, said bracket is secured pivotly with a second bracket, adapted to move in the horizontal and vertical direction by a pneumatic cylinder, and said second bracket is mounted on a pair of guides provided to guide the vertical movement of said bracket.<br>
In accordance with this invention a feeding device for use in polybagging machine has a belt conveyor for conveying the packets to the stack formation station of the bagging machine. A stack pusher is provided at the right angle to the belt conveyor for pushing the stack onto a base plate and which is being conveyed to the feeding station of the bagging machine.<br>
Specifically   in   accordance   with    this<br>
invention  the base plate having plurality  of  channels and  a  finger  pusher assembly  provided  therewith  is<br>
provided  to  convey the stack instead of  the  conveyor belt provided for conveying the stack of the packets  in<br>
the conventional machine.<br>
A   feeding  device for  use  in  polybagging<br>
machine  according to a preferred embodiment  is  herein described  and illustrated in the accompanying  drawings<br>
wherein s-<br>
Fig.  1 shows plan view of the feeding assembly  of  the known art.<br>
Fig.  2 shows the plan view of the feeding  assembly of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 3  shows the side view of the finger pusher and Fig. 4 shows the top view of the finger pusher.<br>
Referring to the drawings particular fig. 1 the conventional feeding device has a conveyor belt B<br>
for receiving and conveying the packets P received from the packaging machine. A pusher P adapted to be<br>
operated by a pneumatic cylinder C is provided over  the<br>
conveyor belt B such as to push the stack of the packets onto a second belt B1 which convey stack of the  packets S to the feeding station F of the bagging machine.<br>
Reference  is now made to fig. 2 the  feeding<br>
device according to this invention has a conveyor belt 1 for  receiving and conveying the packets P to the  stack<br>
making station of the machine.  A stopper 3 is  provided to  stop the packets P at the stack making  station.   A<br>
pusher 2 adapted to be operated by  a pneumatic cylinder 4 in a conventional manner is provided over the conveyor<br>
belt 1 such as to push the stack of packets onto a  base plate  5.   These features do not  constitute  invention<br>
features  according to this invention.<br>
Specifically   in   accordance   with    this<br>
invention  the base 5 has a plurality of channels 6  and is provided in place of the second conveyor belt as such<br>
known  in  the conventional  bagging, machine.   Further according  to  this invention a finger  pusher  assembly<br>
(fig.  3 and 4) is provided below the base plate 5  such that  to  convey the stack of packets S  from  the  base<br>
plate 5 to the feeding station F of the bagging machine.<br>
As  shown in figs. 3 and 4 the finger  pusher<br>
assembly comprises a plurality of fingers 7 secured with a bracket 8. Bracket 8 is pivotly secured to a bracket<br>
9 such that to be operated by the pneumatic cylinder 18 and 11 in the horizontal and vertical direction. Finger<br>
pusher 7 are provided to convey the stack of packets 8 to the feeding station F of the bagging machine. Guides<br>
12 are provided to guide the vertical movement of the bracket 9. A stack pusher 13 (fig.2) adapted to be<br>
operated by a pneumatic cylinder 14 in a conventional manner is provided at the feeding station F of the<br>
feeding machine for bagging purposes.<br><br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1. A feeding device for polybagging machine comprising a first conveyor belt (1) provided for conveying the packets (P) received from the packaging machine to a stack making station of a polybagging machine, a stack pusher (2) being provided to push the stack onto a base plate (5) characterized in that said base plate having a plurality of channels (6) being provided for guiding the conveyance of the stack of packet to the feeding station (F), finger pusher assembly (7) being provided below said base plate such that to convey the stack of packet (S) to the feeding station, wherein said finger pusher assembly comprises a plurality of finger pusher secured with a first bracket (8), said bracket is secured pivotly with a second bracket (9), adapted to move in the horizontal and vertical direction by a pneumatic cylinder (10 and 11), and said second bracket is mounted on a pair of guides (12) provided to guide the vertical movement of said bracket.<br>
2.       A   feeding   device   for   polybagging   machine   substantially   as   herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
