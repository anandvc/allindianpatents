The  invention relates to a clamping device  of a disc brake, especially for use with heavy commercial vehicles, comprising<br>
-	at   least   one plunger which is displaceable in the  direction o£ a plunger axis for applying a brake pad to a brake disc,<br>
-	at   least one eccentric which is rotatable about a transverse axis,<br>
-	a roll body carried on the eccentric for transmitting actuating forces to the plunger,<br>
-	at  least  one adjusting member which is rotatable about an adjusting axis extending at  an  angle to the transverse axis to compensate for lining wear,   and<br>
-	a pin fixed to the eccentric and cooperating with the adjusting member to transmit the torque for effecting an adjustment to compensate for lining wear.<br>
A device  of this kind has been  known,<br>
It  is    the  object  of the invention to allow,   in connection with  a device  of the kind mentioned,   a particularly  simple and reliable assembly of the,   or each,   eccentric and the structural elements coacting therewith.<br>
According to the present  Invention,   said object is achieved in that the pin forms part  of a safety mechanism by which the roll body is prevented from inadmissibly moving in<br>
the  direction of the transverse axis with  respect to the<br>
^   •   " pin therefore./       ,_..  .<br>
eccentric.  The/	-	in addition to its previous<br>
function to form part  of an angular  drive between eccentric<br><br>
and  adjusting member,   has an  additional  function  as retaining member,   which provides  for an overall   simplified  construction.<br>
According to another aspect the  invention relates  to  a clamping device of a disc brake,   especially for use with heavy commercial vehicles,   comprising<br>
at least one plunger which  is  displaceable  in  the direction of a plunger axis  for  applying a  brake pad to  a  brake disc,<br>
a rotary member which  is rotatable about a transverse axis and has  at least one ecentric for displcing the plunger,   and<br>
at least one adjusting member which  is rotatable about an adjusting axis  extending at an  angle to  the transverse axis to compensate for lining "wear,<br>
wherein one of said  two members  carries    a pin  extending into a recess of  the other one of  said members  for transmitting toroues.<br>
A clmaping device having an  angular  drive of the kind mentioned above  is known wherein  two radially projecting pins  are  fixed to the rotary  body and  a drive lever  is  arranged on  the adjusting member,   the outer contour of which  is  similar  to  a  toothing having three teeth  and  two gaps.       Each  of the gaps  is  engaged  by one of the two pins,   respectively,   fixed  to the rotary member. Thereby the adjusting member  is  connected to  the rotary member  by a kind of mangle gear which has  been known  since ancient times  for angular drives and which,   compared to modern toothings,  has the drawback  that there  is only point contact between pins and teeth resulting in high  surface pressures  that cause wear.     Wear,  however, is provided on each of said members.<br><br>
particularly undesired in an angular  drive   of the kind discussed above,   for it results in that,   in the    course of time,  the brake slack where an adjustment takes place becomes  increasingly larger.<br>
Similar  statements apply  in respect  of the clamping  device known      which    also    belongs    to the    afore  described kind    comprising     an  angular    drive.     There,     a    pin extending radially beyond    a rotary member  is carried on the  latter  such that   it   is    pivot able  about   an axis crossing the axis of the rotary member.   Again,   a lever is fixed to the adjusting member that  is to rotate   upon rotations to the rotary member,   said lever having a recess into which the pin extends.     It  cannot be avoided here either that the pin    contacts the edge  of the associated recess  only pointwise at  least  when the rotary member and the adjusting member  occupy certain positions.<br>
In another clamping  device  having been  known    and belonging as    well    to    the  afore-described    kind comprising  an angular     drive,   the    pin    fixed to    the rotary member has a spherical    head which       is embraced    in a fork-lime manner by a lever    mounted    to the    adjusting    member.     In the most     favourable     case     it     is    possible     here,     however  only in the    area of a center position    of    the    pin with respect to the lever,  to    achieve    a line    contact  between    pin and lever.<br>
More favourable contacting is achieved with a known clamping device     in which also    a rotary    member     rotatable  about  a first  axis for actuating    a brake    is    connected    to an adjusting    member    rotatable    about     a  second    axis    to compensate    for    lining    wear,     said    two axes    intersecting at     a right     angle.     The     said    two    members       directly engage    each other via    beveL      gear    toothings<br><br>
The two   bevel  gear  toothings  contact  each other  at least along one contact line in  every operative position.     Said  comparatively favourable contacting demands however the high price of relatively high manufacturing costs.<br>
According to the second  aspect as well  the invention has there¬fore  as object to design  a clamping device comprising an adjusting member  for  compensating lining wear  in  a disc  brake in  such a way that  it can  be manufactured with a minimum of expenditure.<br>
Starting from a clamping device of the kind mentioned above the object according to the second aspect of the invention is achieved in that a sliding block is rotatably supported on the pin which is fixed  to one of the said two members,   said  sliding block having a profile which  is complementary to the  sectional  shape of the recess  in the other one of the two members and  being  slidingly guided  along said recess.<br>
According to a third  aspect the  invention relates to  a clamping device of a disc brake,   especially for use with heavy commercial vehicles,   comprising<br>
at least one plunger which is displaceable in the'direction of a plunger axis for applying a brake pad to a brake disc,<br>
a rotary member which  is rotatable about a transverse axis and  includes at least one eccentric for displacing the plunger,<br>
at least one adjusting member adapted to  be rotated  by the rotary member about an adjusting axis.<br><br>
-  an  adjusting drive which  is adapted to  be driven by the adjusting member  to compensate for lining wear at the  brake pads,<br>
a  sliding clutch arranged  between  the adjusting member and the adjusting drive,   and<br>
a pressure member for transmitting an axial  force determining the torque which can  be transmitted  by the  sliding clutch.<br>
In practice,   over-adjustments have sometimes been observed with clamping devices of the above-mentioned kind.     Therefore,   the third  aspect of the  invention has  as object to design  a  clamping device with adjusting members to  compensate for linging wear  in a disc  brake at low structural   expenditure,   in  such a way that over-adjustments are prevented.<br>
Starting from a clamping device of the above-described kind the object of the invention according to the third aspect is achieved in  that the adjusting member and  the pressure member  engage telescopically without contacting each other and are supported independently of each other.<br>
Am embodiment of the present invention will  be described with<br>
further details  below,   with reference to  the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which:<br>
Fig.1   is a side sectional view of a clmaping device along plane I-I<br>
in fig.2, Fig.2 is the longitudinal  section II-II  in fig.1 Fig.3 is the cross section III-III in fig.1<br>
Fig.4  is a part view in the direction of arrow IV in fig.3 and Fig.5 is pn enlarged partial  section of fig.3.<br><br>
The drawings illustrate a clamping  device 10  of a con¬ventionally desgined    disc brake  for use with heavy trucks and buses which is assigned to a brake  disc  (not  illustrated) rotatable about  a brake  disc axis A.     The clamping  device 10 has a housing  12 constructed to form part  of a brake caliper  (not  illustrated)   and closed by a housing cover 14.   Strong  screws  16  fix the housing  cover  14 to the housing  12  and a seal   18   of sheet  material  is arranged between the two parts.     A rotary member 20   is arranged in the housing 12 which  is rotatable about  a transverse  axis B corssing    the brake  disc axis A at  a right angle and accordingly extending parallel to the brake disc.     The rotary member 20  has a center portion 22  between two eccentrics 24 each of  which is mounted in the housing cover 14 by two cylinder-sect or-shaped or  cup-shaped roller bearings 26.   A roll body 28  is supported by means  of  a bearing  box 27  at  each   one  of the two eccentrics 2 4,   the axis of which extends parallel to the transverse  axis B.<br>
One each  of two plungers  30  is assigned to the Two eccentrics 24,   each  of  said plungers having a plunger axis C extending parallel to the brake  disc axis A and intersecting the transverse axis B at  a right angle.     The Plungers 30   are arranged symmetrically with respect to a center plane of the clamping device  10,   which contains the brake disc axis A and is normal to the transverse axis B.     Each  of the two plungers  30   is comprised of a sleeve-shaped plunger portion 32,   a bolt-shaped plunger portion  34 and a cap  36.     Each<br>
of the two sleeve-  shaped plunger portions  32  is mounted<br>
bushing in a  slide  ~        *   38 press fitted into the housing 12<br>
to be slidable along  its proper plunger axis C and rotatable<br>
about the same.     Each of the plunger portions 32 has an<br>
internal thread with which it  is screwed to a complementary<br>
outer thread of the  associated bolt-shaped plunger portion<br>
34.     The two caps  36   are press fitted in the associated<br><br>
sleeve-shaped plunger portion 32,   each having  a planar front  face which  is     averted from  said plunger portion   32 and normal to the plugner axis C,   on which the associated roll body 28  is adapted to be rolled.     In  order to prevent wear even with high loads the caps  36  are made   of high-strength  steel  and are hardened,   as are the  roll bodies 28.     The threads connecting the plunger portions  32  and 34 belonging to each other are  self-re straining such that loads  on the plungers  30   inthe  direction  of their re¬spective plunger axis C cannot cause a rotational movement of the plunger portions  32  and 34 with respect  to each other.<br>
Each of the two sleeve-shaped plunger portions  32  carries a toothed rim 40  fixed to said portions  32 which meshes with a gear 42 mounted on a centralplate  44 for rotation about  an axis parallel to the plunger axes C;   the plate 44 is  axially supported by the two toothed rims 40   and loaded by reset   springs 46.     The latter are mounted with pre-tension between the central plate  44 and the housing 12  such that they constantly keep the two plungers  30, via the caps 36 thereof,   in engagement with the roll bodies 28.   The two bolt-shaped plunger portions  34 project  axially from the  sleeve-shaped plunger portions  32  and the  slide bushings  38,  have  a substantially enlarged diameter and are connected with each  other by a protective plate  48 thus being prevented from rotating.<br>
The illustrated clamping device 10  further includes an adjusting means 50 with an adjusting axis D arranged parallel to the plunger axes C.  The adjusting means 50 comprises a pinion 52  supported in the housing 12 and constanlty meshing with the toothed rim 40  of one  of the two plungers 30.  A reset  shaft 54 is mounted in the pinion 52 and in the housing cover 14 so as to be rotatable about<br><br>
the  adjusting axis D and slidable longitudinally.    The reset shaft  54 has an:inner hexagon head 56  as well as an outer hex-agon head 58.     Normally,  the reset   shaft  54 is held by a helical  spring 60   in the position illustrated infig.   2 in which the inner hexagon head 56  is received in a cavity of the pinion 52  such that the pinion 52  is rotatable un¬influenced by the reset   shaft  54.     With the aid of a tool, e.g.   a socket wrench  *   engaging the  outer hexagon head 58 it  is possible todisplace the  reset   shaft  54 along the adjusting axis D overcoming the resistance  of the helical spiing 60  such that the inner hexagon head 56 engages a hexagon socket  62  of the pinion 52.     The pinion 52 can be rotated in this manner for rotation of the two sleeve-shaped plunger portions 32  into their respective  illustrated starting positions in which the two plungers 30 have their minimum possible length which  is a requirement for ex¬changing worn brake pads for new ones.<br>
A pressure member 64 formed by an inner  sleeve  is supported on the reset  shaft  54 and pre-tensioned towards a sliding clutch 68  designed as multi-plate clutch by a helical spring 66  supported at the housing cover 14 and pressing the clutbh plates against  each  other.     A bearing  sleeve 67  is by means of a resilient nose 67*   formed on it   in locking engagement with the housing cover 14 in such  a v/ay that  it  is locked against  rotation  and axial  displace¬ment.   A sleeve-shaped adjusting member 70   is mounted in the bearing sleeve 67 to allow rotation but no axial displacement.    The adjusting member 70 embraces the pressure member 64,   but does not contact  it  so that torque cannot be transmitted directly frcm the adjusting member 70  to the  pressure member 64.   ^n  outer  sleeve 72  is supported on the adjusting member 70.   A wrap spring74 constituting an overriding clutch connects the adjusting member 70  and the outer sleeve 72  such that  upon rotation the adjusting<br><br>
member 70 takes along the  outer  sleeve 72  in  one  direction only.     The  outer sleeve 72  is connected for ccmmon rotation with every second plate  of the multi-plate clutch 68,   while the  other plates are     connected to the  pinion 52.     It   is thus possible for the multi-plate clutch to transmit  a limited torque  from the  outer sleeve 72 to the pinion  52 dependent  on the pre-tension of    the helical  spring  66.<br>
The rotary member 20   is connected to the  adjusting member 70 by an angular  drive  described in the following:<br>
A pin 76  extending parallel to the transverse axis B  is fixed to the rotary member 20 .     Said pin 76  includes a thread portion 77   screwed into a tap hole 78   of the rotary member 20,   which is parallel to the transverse axis B  and spaced apart therefrom,   and further  inlcudes a cylindrical portion 79 projecting frcm said hole.   A sliding block 80 is supported on the cylindrical portion 79 which consists for example  of sintered bronze  or another self-lAbricating material  and has the  other shape of  a cylinder.   normal to sthe pin 76.     Said cylinder is illustrated as circle  in fig. 1,   whereas it is drawn as rectangle in fig. 2.    The  sliding block 80   is guided in  a recess 82  shaped complementarily to the  outer shape of the  sliding    block 80   of a cylinder, having thus the approximate  shape of a circular arc in profile;   the axis E of the recess 82 extends parallel to the adjusting axis D of the adjusting  device 50.     The recess 82  is  drilled or milled in a flange 84  of the adjusting member 70  such that  it   is open along its entire length towards the outer surface area of the flange 84 to leave space for the pin 76.<br>
The rotary member 20  has between its center portion 22     and its two eccentrics 24  one collar 85,respectively,   which is axially supported at   a projection 86   of the housing<br><br>
cover 14.     A helical  reset   spring 87  ending  in two legs<br>
88	and 89   is arranged around the center portion 22.     Leg<br>
89	is    hooked to a retaining sheet  element  90 which rests against   one  of the two collars 85  and is fixed to the housing  cover 14 by means of screws  91.     The  other leg  38 is hooked to an actuating  lever 92  forming  an integral part  with the rotary member 20.   The  actuating  lever 92 has  a cup 94 which is engageable by a plunger  of the pneumatic actuating cylinder.     The actuating cylinder  and its plunger have conventional constructions and are there¬fore not  illustrated;   a trunk-shaped extension 96  is formed at the housing cover 14 for passage  of the plunger,<br>
one mount  98,   respectively,  being punched frcm sheet material<br>
inthe  illustrated example is fixed by the pin 76  or a common machine  screw 97 to the two ends  of the rotary member 20   i.e.   to one end face, - respectively,   of  its two eccentrics 24.     Bach  of the mounts 98 prevents the  roll body    28 supported at the respective eccentiric 24 from moving to the  outside  inthe direction  of the transverse  axis B. The  roll bodies 28 are prevented frcm moving axially to the inside,   namely towards the center plane  of the clamping device   10,   by the center portion 22   of the  rotary member 20.<br>
The two bearing shells 27 are locked against anaxial displacement  in the same way by one  of the two mounts 98, respectively,   and by the center portion  22   of the  rotary member 20.  Moreover,   each  of the two mounts 98 cooperates with the  adjacent roller bearing 26   such that the roll bodies thereof,   which are needles in the  illustrated example,   are in each case  urged into their respective starting positions apparent frcm figs.   3 and 5 when,<br>
following a brake actuation,  the actuating lever 92 returns to its rest position.     To this end,   each  of the mounts 98<br><br>
has a proejction 99 engaging the  adjacent roller bearing 26  and acting as catch  for a cage  100   in which the roll bodies  are retained.<br>
Since each of    the two eceentrics 24  in the illustrated example is supported at the housing cover 24 by two roller bearings 26  arranged side-by—side,   as  seen  in axial direction,   and the two mounts 98  cooperate in each case only with the directly adjacent   outer  one of said roller bearings,   an additional mount  98   is fixed to the  axially inner end of each eccetnric  24 which is located adjacent the center portion 22,   said additional mount  98*   having a projection 99*   formed on it with which  it  engages the roller bearing 26  next to it   such that  also the cage  100 thereof  is urged to return to its res position following each brake actuation.<br>
In the example  illustrated the tx^o mounts 98*   are     secured to the associated collar 85 by grooved drive  studs 97*.<br>
If  starting form the rest  position  illustrated in the drawings,  the rotary member 20   is rotated clockwise  about the transverse  axis B  according to fig. 3,   the roll  bodies 28  supported onthe two eccentrics 24 of said member 20 urge the two plugners  30 towards the right according to fig. 3,   whereby the brake pads (not  illustrated)   supported on the bolt-shaped plunger portions 34 are applied to the associated brake disc.   At the same time,   the described angular drive formed by the pin 76,   the sliding block 80 and the recess 82  of the  adjusting member 70 causes the translation of the rotation of the rotary member 20  into a rotation of the adjusting member 70  about the adjusting axis D.   Said rotation is transmitted by the wrap spring 74 to the  outer sleeve 72.     if the brake  slack to be over¬come  upon baake pad application has exceeded a certain<br><br>
amount  due to wear  of the brake linings,   the torque that the multi-plate clutch 68  is capable  of transmitting  from the  outer sleeve 72 to the pinion 52   sufficias to cause a rotation  of the  sleeve -  shaped plunger portions  32,   whereby the   overall  length  of each the two plungers  30   is in¬creased,   in  other words an adjustment   is effected.<br>
The torque adopted to be transmitted by the multi-plate clutch is also material  for the loading  of the  sliding block 80   and the recess 82  guiding it.     Since both  elements have closely adapted,   almost completely identical configu¬rations they contact  each  other over a relatively large cylindrical  surface and the surface pressure occunring between them is    a minor  one even if the multi-plate clutch 68  is adjusted such that   it  can transmit  a relatively large torque to be able to overcome with certainty frictional resistances in the  mutually engaging threads of the plunger portions  32  and 34.<br><br><br>
