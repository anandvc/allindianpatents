				<td>FIELD OF INVNETION<br>
This invention relates to a mechanical system for chopping and crushing of water hyacinth.<br>
Prior Art;<br>
Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart. )Solms) is the most predominant persistent and troublesome aquatic weed in the world and has posed ecological and economical problems in several countries. Utilization of water hyacinth as animal feed, as a fuel, handicrafts, furniture, biogas, compost, pollution abatement and paper pulp has been done. However, one of the major problems faced was bulk and the cost of transportation of freshly harvested water hyacinth from water bodies to the factories. Hence the major objectives were to determine the physical and bulk mechanical properties of water hyacinth and to evaluate the suitability of available choppers/crushers for water hyacinth.<br>
The matured water hyacinth plant (Eichhornia crassipes) consists of long fibrous roots which may be up to three meters in length, rhizomes, buoyant petioles, stolons, leaves, inflorescence and fruit clusters. The petioles are the leaf stems and the stolons are the runners, which form new plants. The inflorescence bears between 6 and 120 lily like violet and yellow flowers most commonly between 8 and 15. Like most flowers, which are at their best when the soil is impoverished, water hyacinth has the best flowers when the nutrients in water are in short supply. The fruit is a capsule, containing up to 450 seeds. Altogether, the plant can grow up to a meter high. Water hyacinth plant has shiny dark green<br>
leaves. Water hyacinths grow over wide variety of wetland types from lakes, streams, ponds, waterways, ditches, and backwater areas.<br>
This free floating fresh water plant has spread from tropical South America to at least fifty countries around the world. The plant originated in the rich and diverse rain forests of the Amazon River, Basin and was introduced into many parts of the world as an ornamental garden pond plant owing to its beauty in India it was first introduced as an ornamental plant in 1896 from Brazil (Aquaphyte, 2001). It spreads over 5, 00, 000 hectares of water among the states of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Orissa. In India water hyacinth is known by different names such as Jalkumbhi, Falkumbi, Shokh Samunder (Hindi), Pisachi Thanana (Tamil), Kachuripuri (Bengali) and Kulavali (Kannada). It is particularly suited to tropical and sub tropical countries where environmental conditions favour a year round growing period and has become a problem plant in areas of Southern USA, South America, East, West &amp; Southern Africa, South-East Asia and Australia. The capacity of water hyacinth to grow and reproduce is phenomenal and in one growing season 25 plants can give rise to 2 million plants, covering one hact. and weight as much as a fully loaded Jumbo Jet (Lindsey and Hirt, 1999). The natural loss of water from the water surface by evaporation is thought to increase through transpiration from the leaves of water hyacinth by at least 40 to 50 percent (Lindsey and Hirt 1999.) Due to this, some times it is called "Shokh Samunder" in India. The oxygen depleting load of one hact. of water hyacinth mat is equivalent to the sewage created by 80 persons<br>
 (Gopal and Sharma, 1981). This action lowers the natural ability of water body to absorb organic pollution and create septic and odorous conditions. Over the years, various control methods have been studied and tried including chemical, biological and mechanical means but with no lasting success. It is effective and relatively cheaper than the mechanical and manual control. However, their long-term effects on the environment are unknown and sprayed plants were left to rot in the water causing pollution and aggravated entrophication. The plants cannot be completely controlled by biological method. Control by mechanical and manual harvesting has been widely practiced in many countries. The simplest mechanical method of control would be to chop the water hyacinth in situ and leave it to rot in the water. This, however, has two main drawbacks:<br>
The plant is wasted (not utilized)<br>
In the process of decay, the chopped plant extracts oxygen from<br>
the water causing suffocation to animal life in water body.<br>
A major contributory factor to the failure of water hyacinth machinery is the large volume and moisture content of water hyacinth, which slows down the harvesting operation by increasing requirement for handling, transport and cuts down harvester productivity with increased harvesting cost. It also limits effective utilization due to low dry matter content and high drying equipment costs. Water hyacinth removed in large quantities from water body can be transported easily when chopped and crushed to higher densities. Packaging to higher density than the conventional bale reduce the problem of transportation, storage space and provides better flow characteristics during material handing (Ferrero et. al. 1999).<br>
Chopping and compacting have been proposed as means of reducing volume or increasing density for easy handling and transportation of forage plants (Ferrero et al. 1991). Generally flail, flywheel and cylindrical types of choppers are used for forage chopping. Bernaki et al. (1972) stated that in a flail type forage chopper, the accuracy of chopping was worse for cutting fresh corn stalks. Bernaki also studied on flywheel chopper and cylindrical chopper and finally concluded that the cylindrical chopper was in many respects functionally better than flywheel one. Kanafojski and Karwowski (1976) studied the energetic of knife-type choppers. It was also concluded that the power requirement for a cylindrical type chopper was approximately 7 percent lower in case of flywheel type chopper under identical working conditions. Bangall (1982) worked on fresh water hyacinth and he reported that compression to 400 Kg/m3 required 2.4-watt-h/t and 800 Kg/m3 required7.8 watt-h/t energy respectively. O'Dougherty (1982) concluded that the blades used in forage chopping should have a blade angle in the range of 30° to 40° with a rake angle of 10 to 20° cutting up to the speeds of 30 m/s. The review shows that the power loss due to the water resistance and mechanical losses were high in flail type of cutters and also the accuracy of cutting was worse.<br>
Crushing and pressing of plants is one of the commonly used methods for expressing appreciable amount of plants juice (Calilung, 1990). However, several investigators have explored more intensive crushing of alfalfa and other forage crops (Chancellor, 1955, 1964 and Spencer et al., 1969). Under intensive crushing treatments. 50 per cent of the initial moisture and an appreciable amount of the soluble dry matter may be removed from the harvested material as the liquid fraction. Rollers, piston extrusion, cone press and screw presses are the most commonly used equipments used for crushing of fibrous agricultural products. The power requirement for a cylinder type of chopper is approximately 7 percent lower than in case in flywheel type chopper under identical conditions. Therefore, cylindrical choppers can be selected for chopping of water hyacinth for volume reduction over conventional flail and flywheel types of choppers. The review also suggested that chopping and biomass reduction are two separate processes. The review indicates that the most attractive alternative for solving the water hyacinth problem is integrated harvesting and utilization, which offers potential benefits in terms of generation of useful products (AQUAPHYTE, 2001: Mathur et al,, 2003). The mechanical mean is the only safe and rapid method to control the growth of water hyacinth but the disposal costs are high because of its bulk. In order to solve this problem, water hyacinth has to be chopped and crushed. The chopped and crushed plants will not allow water hyacinth to re-grow.<br><br>

A system for the harvest of water hyacinths. The floating hyacinths are conveyed from their surface disposed growing disposition to a grinder. Grinding occurs with liberation of large amount of the plant contained water and exposure of the hyacinths' fibrous plant material which only becomes suitable for baling after grinding has occurred. Thereafter, the hyacinths' fibrous material is placed into a conventional baler where the now ground plant material adheres when baled into a cohesive mass. The baled fibrous material is then disposed of. For example, the baled material can be attached to rope, and pushed into the water with bales being serially attached one to another via the rope. One end of the rope is led ashore. Thereafter, the serially tethered bales are pulled floating from harvesting barge to a shore location where conventional removal of the compacted and baled fibrous biomass can occur. In one embodiment, the bales are further compacted on the shore before transport for fuel or other uses. In another embodiment, a shore mounted facility accumulates, grinds and bales the water hyacinth. Weighting of the bales for disposal by sinking is disclosed.<br>

Floating aquatic vegetation harvested from the surface of a body of water. The vegetation is chopped or shredded when floating in situ on the body of water. The vegetation is then removed from the water surface. The chopping, shredding, tearing or other action breaks down the structure of the plants or subdivides them into smaller parts. This reduces the structure of the plant and allows it to be compacted to a much higher density mass so that it can be handled more readily. The apparatus for harvesting the vegetation includes a self-propelled vessel. A shredding head is carried on the vessel for shredding the vegetation as the platform advances theracross and removing the shredded vegetation from the surface of the body of water. The vegetation shredding means are two rotors arranged in a shallow V arrangement across the front end of the vessel, with the point of the V directed forwardly, in the direction of travel. Rotors arranged in this way assist with the positive tracking of the platform. When rotated so that the bottom of the rotor travels towards the rear, and the top towards the front, the vegetation is directed towards the center of the vessel, behind the rotors, in a windrow for subsequent pickup. The V configuration also limits dispersion of the vegetation around he ends of the rotors. The rotors are covered on the top and ends<br>
by a shroud. This assists in preventing dispersal of the rent material and serves as part of the collecting system.<br>
The above cited documents deal with the water hyacinth till the harvesting.<br>
Further, it is known to have a provision for dumping of chopped hyacinth at the lake shore, which leads to formation of a heap. This causes environmental pollution as the chopped plants extract oxygen from water affecting adversely animal lives. Further, in case of suitable ground condition i.e. muddy or watery ground, the chopped plants can regrow. Yet further, due to large volume of the plants, transportation of the same is expensive.<br>
Further, a device is known to have been provided in the art which comprises a boat loaded with a grinder to grind the plants collected from the water surface to a paste, from which water cann't be separated.<br>
The disadvantage associated with the above is that, water becomes unsuitable to drink upon getting mixed with the lake (after release from grinding of water hyacinth).<br>
The chopped plants can be crushed by a screw conveyor. However, the same is associated with several disadvantages as listed below:<br>
i.         It is time dependent i.e. it consumes a lot of time.<br>
ii. Crushed water hyacinth causes chocking of holes and outlets of the barrel of the screw.<br>
iii.      The  plants travel a long distance, which causes chocking of fibrous roots in the barrel hole and at the out let of the screw<br>
auger.<br>
In cylinder type chopper, chopping may be effective but crushing can't be coupled with screw auger which requires forced feeding and having low capacity and does not match with the chopping speed of the cutting cylinders causing a bridging effect at the inlet of the screw.<br>
