				<td>HYDROGENATION OF ESTERS WITH RU/BIDENTATE LIGANDS<br>
COMPLEXES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of catalytic hydrogenation and, more<br>
particularly, to the use of specific chiral Ru complexes with bidentate PP and NN ligands,<br>
in hydrogenation processes for the reduction of esters or lactones into the corresponding<br>
alcohol or diol respectively.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Reduction of an ester functional group to the corresponding alcohol is one of the<br>
fundamental reactions in organic chemistry, and is used in a large number of chemical<br>
processes. In general, two main types of processes are known to achieve such a<br>
transformation. Such types of processes are the following:<br>
a)	hydride processes, in which a silyl or metal hydride salt, such as LiAlR4, is used;<br>
b)	hydrogenation processes, in which molecular hydrogen is used.<br>
From a practical point of view, hydrogenation processes are more attractive as they<br>
can be run using small amounts of catalyst (typically 10 to 1000 ppm relative to the<br>
substrate) and in the presence of small quantities or even in the absence of solvent.<br>
Furthermore, hydrogenation processes do not require the use of highly reactive and<br>
expensive hydrides, and do not produce important amounts of aqueous waste.<br>
One of the mandatory and characterizing elements of hydrogenation processes is<br>
the catalyst or the catalytic system which is used to activate the molecular hydrogen in<br>
view of the reduction. The development of useful catalysts or catalytic systems for the<br>
hydrogenation of an ester functional group represents still an important, difficult and<br>
unpredictable task in chemistry.<br>
Amongst the few catalysts or catalytic systems known to perform such reductions<br>
one may cite the ruthenium/phosphine complexes, obtained by the reaction of ruthenium<br>
oxide or carboxylate precursor with a mono-, di- or tri-phosphine ligand (an example of<br>
which is described by Elsevier et al. in Chem. Commun., 1998, 1367). In this type of<br>
complex the ruthenium metal is coordinated only by "acac" ligands and phosphine atoms,<br>
limiting thus the diversity of the ligand structure and coordination sphere around the metal<br><br>
center. As a consequence of such little diversity, the tuning of the activity and of the<br>
performance of the hydrogenation process is not easy. Furthermore, the experimental<br>
conditions require very high pressures (at least 70-130 bars) and temperatures<br>
(120-180° C).<br>
However, there is still a need for hydrogenation processes using alternative<br>
catalysts or pre-catalysts, thus to have a greater diversity in the ligand structures and<br>
coordination spheres around the metal center and allowing a higher, and possibly easier,<br>
diversity in the experimental conditions and in the type of reaction which can be<br>
performed.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, the present invention relates to<br>
processes for the reduction by hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of a C3-C70 substrate<br>
containing one, two or three esters, or lactones, functional groups into the corresponding<br>
alcohol, or diol, characterized in that said process is carried out in the presence of a base<br>
and at least one catalyst or pre-catalyst in the form of a ruthenium complex wherein the<br>
ruthenium is coordinated by a diphosphine bidentate ligand (PP ligand) and a diamino<br>
bidentate ligand (NN ligand) comprising at least one substituted α-carbon (relative to a<br>
coordinating nitrogen atom).<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the substrate can be a<br>
compound of formula (1) <br>
wherein Ra and Rb represent, simultaneously or independently, a linear, branched or cyclic<br>
C1-C30 aromatic, alkyl or alkenyl group, optionally substituted; or<br>
Ra and Rb are bonded together and form a C3-C20, preferably C4-C20, saturated or<br>
unsaturated group, optionally substituted.<br>
The corresponding alcohols (i.e (Il-a) and (Il-b)), or the corresponding diol (IF),<br>
of said substrate (I), are of formula<br><br><br>
wherein Ra and Rb are defined as in formula (I).<br>
A compound of formula (II) (i.e. Il-a or Il-b) will be obtained in the case where Ra<br>
and Rb are not bonded together, while a compound of formula (IF) will be obtained in the<br>
case where Ra and Rb are bonded together.<br>
It is understood that by "a linear, branched or cyclic	aromatic, alkyl, or alkenyl<br>
group" it is meant that said Ra or Rb can be in the form of, e.g., a linear alkyl group or can<br>
also be in the form of a mixture of said type of groups, e.g. a specific Ra may comprise a<br>
linear alkyl, a branched alkenyl, a (poly)cyclic alkyl and an aryl moiety, unless a specific<br>
limitation to only one type is mentioned. Similarly, in all the below embodiments of the<br>
invention when a group is mentioned as being in the form of more than one type of<br>
topology (e.g. linear, cyclic or branched) and/or unsaturation (e.g. alkyl, aromatic or<br>
alkenyle) it is meant also a group which may comprise moieties having any one of said<br>
topologies or unsaturations, as above explained.<br>
A particular embodiment of the invention's process is shown in Scheme 1:<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the substrate is an ester, or<br>
lactone, that will provide an alcohol, or a diol, that is usefiil in the pharmaceutical,<br>
agrochemical or perfurmery industry as final product or as an intermediate. Particularly<br>
preferred substrate is an ester, or lactone, that will provide an alcohol, or diol, which is<br>
useful in the perfumery industry as final product or as an intermediate.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the substrate is a C5-C30<br>
compound of formula (I), and in particular one may cite those wherein Ra and Rb represent<br><br>
simultaneously or independently a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C30 aromatic or alkyl group<br>
optionally substituted, or a cyclic C5-C30 alkenyl group optionally substituted; or Ra and Rb<br>
are bonded together and form a C4-C20 saturated or unsaturated linear, branched, mono-,<br>
di- or tri-cyclic group, optionally substituted.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the substrate is a C5-L20<br>
compound of formula (I), wherein Ra and Rb represent simultaneously or independently a<br>
linear, branched or cyclic C5-C18 aromatic or alkyl group, optionally substituted, or a cyclic<br>
C5-C18 alkenyl group, optionally substituted; or Ra and Rb are bonded together and form a<br>
C4-C20 saturated or unsaturated hnear, branched, mono-, di- or tri-cyclic group, optionally<br>
substituted.<br>
Possible substituents of Ra and Rb are one, two or three halogen, ORC NRC2 or RC<br>
groups, in which RC is a hydrogen atom, a halogenated C1-C2 group or a C1 to C10 cyclic,<br>
linear or branched alkyl, or alkenyl group, preferably a C1 to C4 linear or branched alkyl or<br>
alkenyl group. As other possible substituents one may also cite a group COORC which can<br>
also be reduced to the corresponding alcohol during the invention's process, according to<br>
the molar amount of H2 used, as well known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Non-limiting examples of substrates are alkyl citmamates, sorbates or salycilates,<br>
alkyl esters of natural (fatty or not) acids, Sclareolide, spirolactones, allylic ester, di alkyl<br>
diesters, (un)substituted benzoic esters, and β-γ unsaturated esters. In particular, the<br>
substrate can be selected from the group consisting of sclareolide, C9-C15 spirolactones and<br>
C1-C4 alkyl esters of 4-methyl-6-(2,6,6-trimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)-3-hexenoic acid. One<br>
can also cite the di alkyl esters of 1,4-dicarboxylate-cyclohexane, the di C1-5 alkyl esters of<br>
the C2-10 alkanediyl-dicarboxylates, C1-5 alkyl cyclopropanecarboxylates, mono-, di- or tri-<br>
methoxybenzoic esters.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the substrate (I) is a<br>
racemic or optically active compound. Indeed in such a case, due to the fact that the<br>
invention complex may comprises at least one ligand which is in a optically active form, it<br>
is possible to selectively or preferentially hydrogenate one particular enantiomer of such<br>
substrate (kinetic resolution of the substrate).<br>
The process of the invention is characterized by the use, as catalyst or pre-catalyst<br>
(hereinafter referred to as complexes unless specified otherwise), of a ruthenium complex<br>
as described above. The complex can be in the form of an ionic or neutral species.<br><br>

each Y represents, simultaneously or independently, a hydrogen or halogen atom, a BH4 or<br>
AlH4 group, a hydroxyl group, or a C1-C6alkoxy or carboxylic radical.<br>
By the expression "said ligand comprising at least one substituted α-carbon",<br>
mentioned for the ligand NN, it is meant a ligand wherein at least one of the carbon atoms<br>

Preferentially, said α-carbon is the one to which the coordinating NH2 group is bound.<br>
The catalyst or pre-catalyst can be also in a supported form, e.g. bounded to a<br>
polymer.<br>
The monodentate ligand can be a phosphine, like PPh3, CO or even a solvent. By<br>
the term "solvent" it has to be understood the usual meaning in the art and in particular<br>
compounds used as diluent in the preparation of the complex or during the invention's<br>
process. Non limiting examples of such solvent are dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile,<br>
dimethylformamide, an alcohol (e.g. an C1-C4 alcohol), or also THF, acetone, pyridine or a<br>
C3-C8 ester or the substrate of the invention's process.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, said NN or PP ligand may be a C3-C40<br>
compound.<br>

According to any one of the embodiments of the invention, at least one of the<br>
ligands is in an optically active form. According to a further embodiment the NN ligand is<br>
in an optically active form. According to another embodiment, both PP and NN ligands<br>
can be in an optically form.<br>
In the present invention, by "optically active form" it is meant here a pure<br>
enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomer enriched in a particular enantiomer, in other terms a<br>
substrate, complex or ligand in an optically active form is characterised by a e.e.<br>
(enantiomeric excess) above 0, typically comprised between 10 and 100% or even between<br>
50 and 100% or between 90 and 99.9%.<br>
The ligands described above can be obtained by applying standard general methods<br>
which are well known in the state of the art and by the person skilled in the art. Many of<br>
said ligands NN or PP are even commercially available.<br>
In a general way, the complexes of formula (1) can be prepared and isolated prior<br>
to their use in the process according to the general methods described in the literature (for<br>
example see H . Doucet et al, Angew.Chem.Int.Ed., 1998, 37, 1703.<br>
It is also understood that the complex of formula (I) can also be obtained in situ<br>
from complexes which have a similar formula or are cationic or anionic, for example a<br>
complex (1) wherein Y has another meaning. Alternatively can be used a complex of<br>
formula [Ru(PP)(Anion)2], which in the presence of a NN ligand are converted into a<br>
compound of formula (1). It is also possible to use a complex of formula<br>
[Ru(NN)(Anion)2] or [Ru(NN)(Anion)(Arene)](Anion), which in the presence of ligand<br>
PP are converted into a compound of formula (1).<br>
To carry out the processes of the invention it is required also to use a base. Said<br>
base can be the substrate itself, if the latter is basic, a corresponding alcoholate or any base<br>
having preferentially a pKa above 11. According to a particular embodiment of the<br>
invention said base may have a pKa above 14. It is also understood that preferably said<br>
base does not reduce itself a substrate of formula (I). As non-limiting examples one may<br>
cite the following type of base: alcoholate, hydroxides, alkaline or alkaline-earth<br>
carbonates, phosphazenes, amides, basic alox, siliconates (i.e. silicium derivatives having<br>
SiO" or SiRO" groups), hydrides such as NaBH4, NaH or KH.<br>
One can cite, as non-limiting examples, alkaline or alkaline-earth metal carbonates,<br>
such as cesium carbonate, an alkaline or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, C1-10 amidures,<br><br>
C10-26 phosphazene or an alcoholate of formula (R31O)2M or R31OM', wherein M is an<br>
alkaline-earth metal, M' is an alkaline metal or an ammonium NR324, R31 stands for<br>
hydrogen or a C1 to C6linear or branched alkyl radical and R32 stands for a C1 to C10 linear<br>
or branched alkyl radical, such as sodium or potassium alcoholates. Of course, other<br>
suitable bases can be used.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, said base is an alkaline alcoholate of<br>
formula R31OM'.<br>
As previously mentioned, the processes of the invention consist in the<br>
hydrogenation of a substrate using a ruthenium complex and a base. A typical process<br>
implies the mixture of the substrate with the ruthenium complex, a base and optionally a<br>
solvent, and then treating such a mixture with molecular hydrogen at a chosen pressure<br>
and temperature.<br>
The complexes of the invention, an essential parameter of the process, can be<br>
added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting<br>
examples, one can cite as complex concentration values those ranging from 50 ppm to<br>
50000 ppm, relative to the amount of substrate. Preferably, the complex concentration will<br>
be comprised between 100 and 20000 ppm. It goes without saying that the optimum<br>
concentration of complex will depend, as the person skilled in the art knows, on the nature<br>
of the latter, on the nature of the substrate and on the pressure of H2 used during the<br>
process, as well as the desired time of reaction.<br>
Useful quantities of base, added to the reaction mixture, may be comprised in a<br>
relatively large range. One can cite, as non-limiting examples, ranges between 5 to<br>
50000 molar equivalents, relative to the complex (e.g. base/com = 5 to 5000O), preferably<br>
20 to 2000, and even more preferably between 50 and 1000 molar equivalents.<br>
The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. When a solvent is required or used for practical reasons, then any solvent current<br>
in hydrogenation reactions can be used for the purposes of the invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples include aromatic solvents such as toluene or xylene, hydrocarbon solvents such<br>
as hexane or cyclohexane, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or MTBE, polar solvents such as<br>
primary or secondary alcohols such as isopropanol or ethanol, or mixtures thereof The<br>
choice of the solvent is a function of the nature of the complex and the person skilled in the<br><br>
art is well able to select the solvent most convenient in each case to optimize the<br>
hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the hydrogenation process of the invention, the reaction can be carried out at a<br>
H2 pressure comprised between 105 Pa and 80x105 Pa (1 to 80 bars) or even more if<br>
desired. Again, a person skilled in the art is well able to adjust the pressure as a function of<br>
the catalyst load and of the dilution of the substrate in the solvent. As examples, one can<br>
cite typical pressures of 1 to 50x105 Pa (1 to 50 bar).<br>
The temperature at which the hydrogenation can be carried out is comprised<br>
between 0°C and 120°C, more preferably in the range of between 20°C and 100°C. Of<br>
course, a person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a<br>
function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products as well as the<br>
desired time of reaction or conversion.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the<br>
abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>

atmosphere unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenations were carried out in stainless steel<br>
autoclave. H2 gas (99.99990%) was used as received. All substrates and solvents were<br>
distilled from appropriate drying agents under Ar. NMR spectra were recorded on a<br>
