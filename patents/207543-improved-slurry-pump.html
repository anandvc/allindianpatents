For assistance in arriving at an understanding of the present invention an example of the device of the invention and a pump incorporating that device are illustrated in the attached drawings. The preceding description of the device and pump may be read with reference to those drawings. However, as the drawings illustrate one example only their particularity is not to be understood as superseding the generality of the preceding description.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for attachment to a centrifugal pump for processing and pumping a slurry containing solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate, characterized in that a grading means is adapted to prevent scale and aggregate which are greater than a predetermined size from passing to the impeller; an attrition means is adapted to reduce any oversized material prevented by the grading means from passing to the impeller to a size less than or equal to the predetermined size, wherein the attrition means includes a rotatable member which is adapted to grind or abrade any oversized scale and aggregate in the slurry said rotatable member comprises a pair of blade portion which extend radially outwards in opposite directions from a central hub.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a device according to the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a pump according to the present invention incorporating the device of Fig. 1.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of the drawings, a preferred form of device 10 according to the present invention can be incorporated in a centrifugal pump 20 for processing and pumping a slurry containing solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate. The device 10 is located in the pump suction line 21 upstream of the pump impeller 22at an inlet 23 to the impeller housing 24. The device 10 includes a grading means 11 and an attrition means 12 and is adapted to minimize choking and/or clogging of the pump impeller 22. The grading means 11 is a means for grading the solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate in the slurry being delivered to the pump to prevent scale and aggregate which are greater than a predetermined size from passing to the impeller 22. The grading means 11 includes a partition or panel in the form of a plate member 13 across the suction line at the inlet 23 to the impeller housing. The plate member 13 includes a plurality of substantially uniformly sized apertures 14 therethrough providing fluid communication with the pump impeller 22. The size of the apertures 14 define the predetermined maximum size of the scale and aggregate in the slurry which is admissible to the impeller. The perforated plate member or grate 13 is typically formed from a robust and durable material such as stainless steel.<br>
The attrition means 12 is a means for reducing the size of any oversized scale<br>
and aggregate material prevented by the grading means 11 from passing to the<br>
impeller. The oversized scale and aggregate is ground down or abraded by the<br>
attrition means to a size less than or equal to the predetermined size	<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A device for attachment to a centrifugal pump for processing and pumping a slurry containing solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate, characterized in that a grading means is adapted to prevent scale and aggregate which are greater than a predetermined size from passing to the impeller; an attrition means is adapted to reduce any oversized material prevented by the grading means from passing to the impeller to a size less than or equal to the predetermined size, wherein the attrition means includes a rotatable member which is adapted to grind or abrade any oversized scale and aggregate in the slurry said rotatable member comprises a pair of blade portion which extend radially outwards in opposite directions from a central hub.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the attrition means has a pair of members between which the oversized solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate can be abraded and disintegrated to a pumpable size.<br>
3.	A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the attrition means has a rotatable member which is adapted to grind or abrade any oversized scale and aggregate in the slurry.<br>
4.	A device as clamed in claim 3 wherein the attrition means has a stationary member against which the rotatable member is adapted to grind or abrade the oversized scale and aggregate to reduce it to a pumpable size.<br>
5.	A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the grading means has a partition in the pump suction line upstream of the impeller, the partition having a plurality of apertures therethrough providing fluid communication with the<br><br>
impeller, the apertures defining the predetermined size of scale and aggregate in the slurry admissible to the impeller.<br>
6.	A device as claimed in claim 5 wherein the partition comprises a plate-like member arranged transverse to a direction of flow for the slurry in the suction line of the pump.<br>
7.	A device as claimed in claim 6 wherein the plate like member of the grading means forms part of the attrition means.<br>
8.	A device as claimed in claim 7 wherein the rotatable member of the attrition means is arranged adjacent to and upstream of the grading means plate member such that the rotatable member is able to abrade any oversized scale and aggregate against the plate member.<br>
9.	A device as claimed in claim 8 wherein the rotatable member has a pair of blade portions which extend radially outwards in opposite directions from a central hub.<br><br>
10.	A device as claimed in claim 9 wherein the blade portions are configured to rotate through an area which covers substantially all of the plate member apertures providing fluid communication with the pump impeller.<br>
11.	A device as claimed in claim 10 wherein the hub of the rotatable member is adapted to be mounted on the impeller shaft for rotation with the impeller.<br><br>
12.	A centrifugal pump for processing and pumping a slurry containing solid and semi-solid scale and aggregate, the pump having the device as claimed in the preceding claims.<br>
13.	A device for attachment to a centrifugal pump for processing and pumping a slurry, substantially as hereinabove described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
