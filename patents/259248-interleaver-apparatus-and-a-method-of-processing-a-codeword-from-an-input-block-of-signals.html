				<td>Interleaver apparatus and receiver for a signal generated<br>
by the interleaver apparatus<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to digital transmission<br>
technology and particularly to transmission concepts<br>
particularly well suited for time-varying transmission<br>
channels as can be found in mobile radio and broadcasting.<br>
Time interleaving and/or frequency interleaving combined<br>
with error-correcting codes (forward error correction, FEC)<br>
belong to a basic principle in transmission technology, as<br>
shown in Fig. 6.<br>
An information word consisting of information bits here is<br>
input in an FEC encoder establishing a codeword from this<br>
information word, i.e. a vector of code symbols or code<br>
bits. These codewords and/or blocks formed therefrom are<br>
passed to the interleaver. It changes the order of the<br>
symbols and passes the symbols thus mixed onto the<br>
transmission channel. The re-sorting of the symbols may<br>
take place in the time axis ("time interleaving") and/or in<br>
the frequency axis ("frequency interleaving").<br>
The use of an interleaver makes sense if the transmission<br>
channel is not static, i.e. if its properties change with<br>
time and/or frequency. Thus, the signal power arriving in<br>
the receiver may vary strongly in a receiver being moved.<br>
Thereby, some code symbols are faulty with higher<br>
probability (e.g. by superposed thermal noise) than others.<br>
Depending on the movement of transmitter, receiver and/or<br>
objects along the transmission path and depending on the<br>
nature of the surroundings of transmitter, receiver and<br>
transmission path, the channel properties may change more<br>
or less quickly. A measure of the temporal constancy of the<br>
transmission channel is the coherence time: the channel<br>
does not change significantly in this time.<br>
The probability of a transmission error usually is<br>
estimated from the channel state. The channel state<br>
describes the quality of the reception signal (e.g. the<br>
momentary ratio of signal strength to noise). It is the aim<br>
of an interleaver to distribute the information in time<br>
(and often also in frequency) so that, with time-varying<br>
channel properties, the ratio of "good" (small probability<br>
of a transmission error) to "bad" (high probability of a<br>
transmission error) symbols becomes approximately<br>
temporally constant on average behind the de-interleaver,<br>
which reverses the interleaver on the transmission side. In<br>
the case of a quickly changing channel property (e.g. high<br>
vehicle speeds), usually a relatively short interleaver is<br>
sufficient. With slowly time-varying channel properties, a<br>
correspondingly greater interleaver length should be<br>
chosen.<br>
The change in the channel properties may result from<br>
various effects.<br>
In the case of multi-path propagation, the relative<br>
phase location of the signal proportions determines<br>
whether the signal proportions superimpose<br>
constructively or destructively. Even a change in<br>
position by a fraction of the wavelength of the<br>
carrier signal here leads to other phase locations.<br>
The channel properties may change correspondingly<br>
quickly. This is referred to as "fast fading".<br>
The signal properties do, however, also strongly<br>
depend on the surroundings. Thus, e.g. walls attenuate<br>
the signal. Correspondingly, the signal quality within<br>
a house usually is worse than outside. The change in<br>
the signal properties correlated with the surroundings<br>
changes slowly as compared with the fast fading.<br>
Correspondingly, this is referred to as "slow fading".<br>
Usually, only the properties of the fast fading are<br>
considered in the interleaver design. Since memory costs<br>
become less and less, however, increasingly very long<br>
interleavers now also become interesting. In this case, the<br>
properties of the slow fading have to be considered to an<br>
increasing extent in the interleaver design.<br>
The following may be mentioned as examples for slow fading:<br>
Mobile reception of satellite signals. For a moving<br>
car, the reception scenario constantly changes<br>
corresponding to the surroundings. For each reception<br>
scenario, three reception states may be defined.<br>
o There is a line-of-sight link to the<br>
satellite (e.g. open road). This is referred<br>
to as "line-of-sight state" (LOS)<br>
o The signals are attenuated (e.g. by trees).<br>
This state often is referred to as "shadow<br>
state"<br>
o The signal is attenuated so heavily that it<br>
is no longer useful. This is often referred<br>
to as "blockage state".<br>
Transmission in cellular networks with transmitters of<br>
relatively low transmission power.<br>
In cellular networks area coverage is achieved by many<br>
transmitters. For this kind of networks, it has to be<br>
reckoned with the fact that the reception conditions<br>
change relatively quickly. Since the transmitter<br>
distance is small, the relative distance of the<br>
receiver may change quickly. In this case, the signal<br>
properties in long interleavers may change strongly<br>
already within the interleaver length.<br>
In the receiver, the exchange of code symbols<br>
(=interleaving) performed in the transmitter is reversed<br>
again (=de-interleaving). This leads to the fact that burst<br>
errors occurring in the transmission are distributed as<br>
individual errors to the entire data block behind the de-<br>
interleaver and my thus be corrected more easily by the FEC<br>
decoder.<br>
The following interleaver types are to be distinguished:<br>
convolution interleaver<br>
block interleaver<br>
Convolution interleavers deal with "inter-block<br>
interleaving", i.e., blocks are "blurred" temporally such<br>
that blocks being in succession before the interleaver are<br>
intertwined behind the interleaver. Here, a block is formed<br>
of one or more codewords. The interleaver length does not<br>
depend on the block size, but on the width of the blurring.<br>
In an exemplary convolution interleaver, a block of FEC<br>
code symbols is divided into e.g. four partial blocks of<br>
unequal size by the interleaver and intertwined with the<br>
upstream and/or downstream blocks.<br>
Convolution interleavers are characterized in that<br>
the output of the FEC encoder is divided into various<br>
partial data streams via a de-plexer. The principle is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7. Here, the data stream usually<br>
is distributed to the partial data streams in bit-wise<br>
manner or in groups of bits ("symbols"). Each partial<br>
data stream then is delayed via delay lines (e.g.<br>
implemented via FIFOs).<br>
For synchronization of the convolution de-interleaver<br>
in the receiver, only the de-multiplexer needs to be<br>
synchronized.<br>
The length of the delay lines may be regularly<br>
stepped. Any arrangements may be chosen, however, so<br>
that successive symbols lie as far apart as possible<br>
and the channel properties therefore are uncorrelated.<br>
Block interleavers deal with "intra-block interleaving",<br>
i.e. the processing takes place in block-wise manner, with<br>
one block consisting of one or more codewords. The block<br>
size here defines the interleaver length. Here, systematic<br>
FEC codes frequently are employed; the data block here<br>
contains useful information (= the information to be<br>
transmitted) and additional redundancy, in order to be able<br>
to correct transmission errors.<br>
Various types of block interleavers are known.<br>
It is the basic principle of a block interleaver that<br>
the elements of a data vector or matrix are permuted,<br>
i.e. exchanged.<br>
The variant of the block being taken for a matrix is<br>
best known. One row here forms e.g. one codeword (e.g.<br>
a Reed-Solomon codeword). The information then is<br>
copied into the matrix row by row and read out column<br>
by column in the transmitter/interleaver. As an<br>
example, the method from the ETSI Standard EN301192,<br>
which is illustrated in Fig. 8, is to be mentioned<br>
here.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the arrangement of the useful data<br>
("application data"). Reading out and/or transmitting then<br>
takes place in datagrams, with Fig. 9 further showing a<br>
matrix arrangement in rows, wherein the matrix has a number<br>
of rows equal to "no_of_rows". Furthermore, as an example,<br>
there is a number of columns extending from a number 0 to a<br>
number 190. In order to fill the matrix, so-called padding<br>
bytes continuing (cont.) up to the last padding bytes are<br>
added after the last datagram.<br>
The interleaver properties may, among other things, be<br>
characterized by the following parameters:<br>
End-to-end delay:<br>
This parameter defines the time interval between the<br>
time instant when the symbol is available at the input<br>
of the interleaver until the time instant when this<br>
symbol is available at the output of the de-<br>
interleaver.<br>
(Receiver) Access time<br>
Time interval between the time instant when the first<br>
symbol is available at the input of the de-interleaver<br>
and the time instant when the codeword is available<br>
and decodable at the input of the FEC decoder, which<br>
means at the output of the de-interleaver. According<br>
to the invention, one only needs to wait until a<br>
sufficiently large part of the codeword is available<br>
at the output of the de-interleaver, and not the<br>
complete time of the end-to-end delay, as long as the<br>
received packets have a sufficient signal-to-noise<br>
ratio. This parameter determines the time between<br>
switching on the receiver or switching to another<br>
program and the availability of the signal (e.g. audio<br>
or video signal) for the user e.g. in a broadcast<br>
receiver. Decoding of e.g. a video signal under some<br>
circumstances may mean further delay, which should not<br>
go into the access time, however. In this respect, it<br>
is to be noted that an audio or video decoder could<br>
generate further delay also having an effect on<br>
services not being time-interleaved.<br>
Memory requirement<br>
The memory requirement is determined by the<br>
interleaver length and the interleaver type as well as<br>
the chosen representation of signals in the<br>
transmitter or receiver.<br>
The above-described interleaver concepts are characterized<br>
by good scrambling both within a codeword or block and<br>
beyond codeword boundaries in temporal respect. As<br>
illustrated in Fig. 7, a change in the order of the<br>
individual symbols in a codeword serially entering the<br>
input-side de-multiplexer is achieved by the delay elements<br>
in the outer interleaver. With respect to the transmission<br>
of these data, this does not have to be temporal scrambling<br>
here, however, but frequency scrambling may also be<br>
achieved therewith. Frequency scrambling is achieved, for<br>
example, if the data stream output from the multiplexer at<br>
the right-side end of the outer interleaver is serial-<br>
parallel converted and associated with a set of e.g. 1024<br>
carriers in an OFDM symbol, so that always two bits of the<br>
output-side data stream are associated with a carrier if<br>
QPSK mapping is used, for example, so that an OFDM<br>
occupation accommodates 2048 bits in the order as generated<br>
by the outer interleaver. Naturally, this means that bits<br>
and/or FEC symbols are arranged on other carriers as they<br>
would have been arranged if the outer interleaver had not<br>
been present, due to the delay elements in the outer<br>
interleaver.<br>
A convolution interleaver or interleaving interleaver with<br>
delays thus works either as time interleaver or as<br>
frequency interleaver or both as time and frequency<br>
interleaver, depending on the subsequent implementation.<br>
It is disadvantageous in the interleaver structure shown in<br>
Fig. 7 that there are high expenditure and high memory<br>
requirements both on transmitter side and on receiver side.<br>
This disadvantage becomes increasingly grave, the bigger<br>
the codewords become, i.e. the more bits are input as a<br>
block into an FEC encoder, and the more bits are output as<br>
a block from the FEC encoder, as shown in Fig. 6, for<br>
example. FEC encoders always have code rates smaller than<br>
1. A code rate of 1/3, for example, means that the number<br>
of bits in a codeword output from the FEC encoder is three<br>
times the number of bits in an input block or information<br>
word input into the FEC encoder, as outlined in Fig. 6. The<br>
interleaver now is to perform as good a temporal and<br>
frequency scrambling as possible, so that a multiplexer<br>
control, and/or generally speaking "processing" of its own,<br>
is needed for every bit and/or for every byte (depending on<br>
the coding scheme of the FEC).<br>
This directly entails that a corresponding de-interleaver<br>
control is needed on the receiver side as well.<br>
Furthermore, quality information, such as a value for an<br>
achieved signal/noise ratio, for a bit error probability or<br>
a probability for the value of the bit and/or byte, has to<br>
be generated for decoding for each bit and/or for each<br>
symbol, wherein such probabilities are employed especially<br>
in so-called soft decoders. While this is not that critical<br>
in relatively small codewords yet, the problem increases,<br>
the longer the codewords become. For reduced transmitter<br>
complexity and particularly for reduced receiver<br>
complexity, which is particularly critical for broadcasting<br>
applications, since the receivers are mass products and<br>
have to be offered cheaply, this means that actually a<br>
small codeword length is desirable. On the other hand, a<br>
greater codeword length provides better advantages with<br>
slowly time-varying channel properties, since a codeword<br>
can be "distributed" over a longer period of time and/or a<br>
greater frequency range.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
efficient, and hence well manageable, transmission concept<br>
also providing good results for channels with slowly<br>
varying properties, however.<br>
This object is achieved by an interleaver apparatus<br>
according to claim 1, a transmitter according to claim 21,<br>
a method of processing a codeword according to claim 22, a<br>
receiver according to claim 23, a method of receiving<br>
according to claim 32, or a computer program according to<br>
claim 33.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that good<br>
efficiency can be maintained also in the case of increasing<br>
codewords, if the interleaver apparatus providing the task<br>
of the convolution interleaver does not perform<br>
interleaving in FEC-symbol-wise manner, but works with<br>
interleaving units (IU), wherein one interleaving unit<br>
comprises at least two FEC symbols. In certain FEC<br>
encoders, an FEC symbol is one bit. In this case, an<br>
interleaving unit comprises at least two bits. In other FEC<br>
encoders, an FEC symbol is one byte. Then, an interleaving<br>
unit includes at least two bytes. The codeword, which<br>
comprises a sequence of interleaving units, with each<br>
interleaving unit having associated at least two symbols,<br>
thus is fed into the interleaving means so as to obtain an<br>
interleaved codeword having a changed sequence of<br>
interleaving units. In particular, the interleaving is<br>
performed so that an order of the symbols within an<br>
interleaving unit is not changed, while the sequence of the<br>
interleaving units is changed so that at least one<br>
interleaving unit of a proceeding or subsequent codeword is<br>
arranged between two interleaving units of one and the same<br>
codeword, or that an order of interleaving units in the<br>
interleaved codeword is different from an order of the<br>
sequence of interleaving units of the codeword prior to the<br>
processing by the interleaving means.<br>
The interleaving achieved thereby is scalable, since the<br>
number of the symbols in an interleaving unit can be<br>
adjusted arbitrarily. In order words, in a fixedly existing<br>
or fixedly designed interleaver, which works in<br>
interleaving units and no longer in symbols, the codeword<br>
length may be increased or decreased arbitrarily. To this<br>
end, the interleaver structures do not have to be changed.<br>
Only the number of symbols in an interleaving unit has to<br>
be changed. With a fixed number of interleaver taps, a<br>
greater codeword can be processed if the number of symbols<br>
in an interleaving unit is increased, while the number of<br>
symbols in an interleaving unit may be reduced when smaller<br>
codewords are to processed. The greater the number of<br>
symbols in an interleaving unit, the more efficient the<br>
receiver- and also transmitter-side processing becomes. On<br>
the other hand, with an increasing number of symbols in an<br>
interleaving unit, the favorable effect of the convolution<br>
interleaving may subside. This effect may, however, be<br>
weakened if, upstream to the convolution interleaver, there<br>
is connected a block interleaver not working in<br>
interleaving-unit-wise manner, but actually performing<br>
block interleaving in FEC-symbol-wise manner before forming<br>
the interleaving units. In this preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a block interleaver and a convolution<br>
interleaver thus are combined, wherein the block<br>
interleaver works in a symbol-wise manner across the entire<br>
block, however, while the convolution interleaver only<br>
works in interleaving-unit-wise and not symbol-wise manner.<br>
In other embodiments, the effective block interleaver may<br>
even be replaced by special FEC codes, which already<br>
achieve a particularly good distribution of the information<br>
across the entire codeword, as are e.g. FEC encoders with a<br>
very long shift register length (e.g. more than 25 memory<br>
cells) of the linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).<br>
According to the invention, the entire receiver may now be<br>
changed to interleaving-unit-wise processing. Hence, soft<br>
information, i.e. side information, associated with a<br>
received interleaving unit, no longer has to be determined<br>
in symbol-wise, but only in interleaving-unit-wise manner.<br>
If an interleaving unit has eight symbols, for example,<br>
this means an 8-fold reduction of the receiver cost.<br>
Moreover, the memory management can be simplified<br>
significantly not only on the transmitter side, but also on<br>
the receiver side, since memories can be read in and read<br>
out substantially more quickly in bursts, wherein a burst<br>
is especially efficient when it concerns adjacent memory<br>
addresses. Since the order within an interleaving unit is<br>
not changed, an interleaving unit may therefore be read out<br>
especially efficiently by a receiver memory in burst-like<br>
manner to perform the functionality of the interleaving.<br>
The individual interleaving units are indeed arranged at<br>
different memory addresses, which may well be distributed<br>
far apart within the memory. The symbols within an<br>
interleaving unit, however, are contiguous and thus also<br>
are filed contiguously in the receiver memory, since the<br>
transmitter-side convolution interleaver does not touch the<br>
order of the symbols within an interleaving unit.<br>
Further advantages of the present invention are that the<br>
management cost and the memory cost for the side<br>
information are reduced strongly on the receiver side,<br>
since the side information only has to be generated,<br>
managed and employed for an interleaving unit and no longer<br>
for every individual symbol. Moreover, in interleaving<br>
units, it may also be determined whether the decoder, in<br>
the case of relatively good transmission quality, has<br>
enough data to perform low-in-error or error-free decoding<br>
already after a certain time and/or after a certain number<br>
of received interleaving units. Then, further interleaving<br>
units may easily be ignored and marked as so-called<br>
"erasures" in the receiver. This leads to significant<br>
reduction in the end-to-end delay.<br>
Furthermore, efficient energy management may be performed<br>
therewith, since the receiver or the relevant part of the<br>
receiver may be placed into a sleep mode, since enough<br>
interleaving units for correctly decoding have already been<br>
received.<br>
Moreover, better receiver access time may also be achieved,<br>
since the receiver already is ready when it has enough<br>
interleaving units, and begins with decoding, and it does<br>
not take decoding a complete codeword for it to be ready.<br>
Preferably, input blocks, i.e. information words with a<br>
length of more than 5000 symbols, and preferably with more<br>
than 10000 symbols, are employed. At a coding rate of 1/3,<br>
for example, the FEC encoder then provides codewords of<br>
more than 15000 symbols. In general, a codeword size at the<br>
output of the FEC encoder of more than 10000 bits is<br>
employed. Preferred interleaving units then not only have<br>
at least two bits/symbols, but at least 100 symbols, so<br>
that a number of interleaving units per codeword is smaller<br>
than 200 and optimally ranges from 10 to 50.<br>

for a transmission channel with good reception<br>
conditions and allowing for short access time<br>
(fast access).<br>
Before explaining the individual figures in detail, at<br>
first special advantages of the preferred interleaver<br>
apparatus, as will be described on the basis of Fig. 1,<br>
will be illustrated. Particularly in the case of long<br>
convolution interleavers, the present invention allows for<br>
efficient realization, which obtains its particular<br>
advantages not only in itself, but also in combination with<br>
special decoder strategies.<br>
The goal of the invention is an interleaver structure<br>
allowing for efficient realization particularly in very<br>
long time interleavers. The structure is advantageous in<br>
connection with the decoder strategies.<br>
The decoder strategies may be subdivided into the following<br>
groups<br>
Without channel state information<br>
Errors have to be recognized and corrected without<br>
additional information<br>
Soft decoding<br>
The probability of a transmission error may be<br>
estimated for each bit or symbol.<br>
Erasure decoding<br>
It is known that no symbol has been received. This<br>
form may be seen as a special case of soft decoding.<br>
For a bit or byte not having been received (or a bit<br>
or byte with extremely low signal/noise ratio), in a<br>
way "guessing" takes place, i.e. the probability of<br>
the bit being a "0" or a "1" is set to 50% each.<br>
The chosen structure particularly offers advantages for<br>
soft decoding and erasure decoding. The chosen structure<br>
has the following advantages:<br>
The channel state information necessary for the<br>
erasure or soft decoding is formed for a block<br>
(interleaver unit = IU) each and stored together with<br>
the IU.<br>
The channel state information may also be used in<br>
order to reduce the memory requirement. Thus, it is<br>
possible that e.g. only the data having sufficient<br>
signal quality are stored.<br>
Since IUs of several bits (typically at least 100 or<br>
more) are managed as one block in the receiver, it is<br>
possible to employ e.g. modern memory chips, which<br>
usually support an access to a data block more<br>
efficiently than a selective access to individual<br>
memory cells.<br>
The structure also allows for better management of the<br>
memory in the case of a program change or upon<br>
switching the receiver on. So as to avoid data from<br>
the old (= previously selected) program and the new<br>
program to be mixed, the memory has to be deleted in<br>
the case of a program change (or it is waited until<br>
the memory is filled with new data). With the proposed<br>
structure, it is sufficient if only the channel state<br>
information is set to "erasure".<br>
The present invention describes an interleaver structure<br>
and accompanying decoder strategies, which are particularly<br>
relevant for systems with long time interleavers.<br>
In connection with low-rate error-correcting codes, the<br>
interleaver allows for secure transmission also in the case<br>
of strongly time-varying channels, as typical e.g. in<br>
satellite transmissions or also cellular terrestrial<br>
networks. With suitable parameters and decoder strategies,<br>
many of the typical disadvantages of interleavers also are<br>
reduced, e.g. the higher access time and the greater memory<br>
requirement.<br>
This is achieved by the data further being processed as<br>
small data packets (IU), on the one hand. This (as already<br>
mentioned above) allows for more efficient management of<br>
the data. So as to achieve full interleaver gain, however,<br>
it is advantageous for the data to be interleaved in bit-<br>
wise manner. This is achieved via a so-called mixer.<br>
Through the concatenation of the two interleavers, the<br>
advantages of bit-wise interleaving thus are combined with<br>
the more efficient implementation of data-packet-orientated<br>
processing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an interleaver apparatus according to the<br>
invention for processing several codewords CW1, CW2, CW3,<br>
which are arranged sequentially in time and form a stream<br>
of output data from an FEC encoder, as it is shown in Fig.<br>
6, for example. Alternatively, the codewords may also<br>
already be codewords output from a block, interleaver or<br>
"mixer", as will be explained with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Each codeword is divided into a number of interleaving<br>
units IU, with each interleaving unit having two indices,<br>
namely the index i and the index j, for notation purposes<br>
only. The index i indicates the sequence number of the<br>
codeword in the codeword sequence, while the index j<br>
indicates the sequence number of the interleaving unit in<br>
the codeword i itself. Importantly, each interleaving unit<br>
includes several symbols, i.e. several bits or bytes,<br>
depending on the FEC encoder, wherein the number of bits or<br>
bytes, i.e., generally speaking, the number of symbols in<br>
an interleaving unit, preferably is greater than 50 and<br>
smaller than 400.<br>
Furthermore, the number of symbols in an interleaving unit<br>
is dependent on the codeword length, so that it is<br>
preferred for each codeword to have preferably at least 50<br>
or even more interleaving units. For clarity reasons only,<br>
codewords are shown with only four interleaving units in<br>
the embodiment shown in Fig. 1.<br>
A codeword is derived from an input block of symbols in an<br>
FEC encoder using redundancy-adding coding, wherein the<br>
codeword comprises more symbols than the input block, which<br>
is synonymous with the statement that the code rate of the<br>
redundancy-adding encoder is smaller than 1. The codeword<br>
comprises a sequence of interleaving units, with each<br>
interleaving unit comprising at least two symbols.<br>
The interleaver apparatus includes, as the heart thereof,<br>
interleaving means 10 formed to change the sequence of the<br>
interleaving units in a codeword to obtain an interleaved<br>
codeword comprising a changed sequence of interleaving<br>
units. In particular, the interleaving unit 10 is formed<br>
not to change an order of the symbols within an<br>
interleaving unit, and to change the sequence of the<br>
interleaving units so that at least one interleaving unit<br>
of a preceding or subsequent codeword is arranged between<br>
two interleaving units of the codeword, and/or that an<br>
order of interleaving units in the interleaved codeword is<br>
different from an order of the sequence of interleaving<br>
units. Preferably, the interleaving means is formed so as<br>
to have an input de-multiplexer 11, a plurality of<br>
connection lines 12 and an output multiplexer 13. After<br>
feeding a number of complete interleaving units to one<br>
connection line, the input multiplexer is formed to switch<br>
to another connection line, wherein the number of complete<br>
interleaving units is equal to or greater than 1.<br>
Furthermore, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the first<br>
connection line 12a has a delay value of substantially<br>
zero. Thus, no delay element of its own in form of a FIFO<br>
memory or a special delay line is disposed. On the other<br>
hand, the second connection line 12b has a defined delay D,<br>
wherein the next connection line 12c has another defined<br>
delay, which is formed by the two delay means D and differs<br>
from the delay in the block 12b. The delay in the<br>
connection line 12c only exemplarily is two times that in<br>
the delay line 12b. Arbitrary delay ratios may be adjusted,<br>
but with an integer raster being preferred at least among a<br>
certain number of connection lines of the plurality of<br>
connection lines, as will be detailed in connection with<br>
Fig. 10, wherein the embodiment shown in Fig. 10 comprises<br>
a plurality of connection lines comprising at least two,<br>
and in the embodiment shown in Fig. 10 even three, groups<br>
of connection lines among themselves, which are<br>
characterized by special common delay values.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment for a transmitter,<br>
wherein the embedding of the interleaver apparatus of Fig.<br>
1 into a transmitter concept also results from Fig. 2. The<br>
transmitter apparatus shown in Fig. 2 includes the<br>
interleaver apparatus according to the present invention,<br>
which is designated with 20 in Fig. 2, as well as an<br>
upstream FEC encoder 22, as well as a downstream<br>
multiplexer 24 and a modulator 26 downstream of the<br>
multiplexer. The interleaver apparatus 20 also includes the<br>
interleaving unit 10 shown in Fig. 1, in the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 2. This interleaving unit 10 is<br>
referred to as "disperser" in Fig. 2, but in principal has<br>
the same functionality as the interleaving unit 10 in Fig.<br>
1. Upstream of the disperser 10, there is a mixer 18, which<br>
is also contained in a preferred embodiment in the<br>
interleaver apparatus 20 according to the invention, in<br>
order to perform, prior to the interleaving-unit-wise<br>
processing in the disperser, a block interleaving function,<br>
in which symbol-wise interleaving, as changing the order of<br>
the symbols in a codeword output from the FEC encoder 22,<br>
is performed.<br>
The receiver structure complementary thereto is shown in<br>
Fig. 3. The input signal is supplied to a demodulator 30<br>
feeding a de-multiplexer 32 capable of extracting<br>
additional information and diverse data streams from the<br>
input signal. Only by way of example, the processing of the<br>
data stream is represented with the number i, wherein this<br>
data stream is the data stream having been generated in the<br>
example shown in Fig. 2. The processing on the transmitter<br>
side and on receiver side for other data streams k, j,<br>
which are other broadcast or television programs or other<br>
conversations, for example, may take place on transmitter<br>
and receiver side, just like the processing of the data<br>
stream i. The data stream i, which has been extracted by<br>
the multiplexer 32, is supplied to a de-disperser 34, which<br>
supplies interleaving units (IUs) to a de-mixer 36, which<br>
then restores the individual codewords, which may then be<br>
supplied to an FEC decoder 38, in order to again create, if<br>
the transmission has been sufficient and/or if enough<br>
redundancy has been added, a reproduction of the input<br>
block of symbols identical - apart from bit errors - with<br>
the input block of the symbols having been fed into the FEC<br>
encoder 22 of Fig. 2 on the transmitter side.<br>
The FEC encoder 22 serves for redundancy addition to the<br>
input signal. To this end, e.g. powerful codes, such as<br>
turbo codes, as they are known e.g. from the 3GPP2<br>
standard, or LDPC codes, as they are for example known from<br>
the DVB-S2 standard, are suitable. Other codes may also be<br>
employed, however. The output of the FEC encoder 22 is a<br>
codeword. The use of relatively long codewords, which are<br>
typically greater than 10000 bits, is advantageous for the<br>
transmission quality.<br>
The mixer 20 is a kind of block interleaver exchanging the<br>
order of the bits within a codeword in symbol-wise, i.e.<br>
bit-wise or byte-wise, manner. Hereupon, the multiplexing<br>
in interleaving units takes place. The output of the mixer<br>
is subdivided into interleaving units (IUs). An interleaver<br>
unit is a group of bits or bytes, or generally a group of<br>
symbols. Typically a codeword should be subdivided into<br>
about 20 interleaver units or more. At a codeword size of<br>
more than 10000 bits, 200 or more bits per interleaving<br>
unit result.<br>
The disperser 10 represents a kind of convolution<br>
interleaver serving to distribute the interleaver units in<br>
time. In contrast to normal convolution interleavers, the<br>
switching does not take place in bit- or symbol-wise<br>
manner, but in interleaving-unit-wise manner.<br>
The output of the disperser 10 may then be multiplexed with<br>
other data, as it is shown in Fig. 2, i.e. additional<br>
information, other programs, or program groups.<br>
The modulator 26 then generates an RF signal therefrom.<br>
Different modulators may be used. Here, only OFDM or a<br>
carrier modulation with n-PSK modulation are mentioned as<br>
examples.<br>
The receiver shown in Fig. 3 includes the demodulator 30,<br>
which comprises an accompanying synchronization means.<br>
Furthermore, frame synchronization may be performed if the<br>
demodulator does not use any frame structure or utilizes<br>
another frame length. This frame synchronization serves for<br>
synchronization of the de-multiplexer and the de-<br>
interleaver.<br>
The de-multiplexer 32 provides a data stream with a series<br>
of interleaving units at its output. Furthermore, a channel<br>
state estimation also is performed, as will be explained<br>
with reference to Fig. 4. Here, the channel state is<br>
estimated not in symbol-wise, but in interleaving-unit-wise<br>
manner or - generally speaking - one piece of reception<br>
quality information is provided per interleaving unit,<br>
somehow providing a statement regarding the reliability or<br>
reception quality of an interleaving unit as a whole.<br>
Channel states, signal-noise ratios, bit error rates etc.<br>
are such reception quality information. No reception<br>
quality information is determined or used per symbol.<br>
The data stream is supplied to the de-disperser, which will<br>
still be explained, and which is implemented by means of<br>
memory management, for example. At the output of the de-<br>
disperser, multiplexing is performed to again generate,<br>
from the interleaving units at the output of the de-<br>
disperser, codewords then subjected to block de-<br>
interleaving in a de-mixer 36, in order to then finally<br>
perform decoding in the FEC decoder 38, for example Viterbi<br>
decoding or any other kind of decoding. Generally speaking,<br>
the de-disperser 34 performs an operation complementary to<br>
the functionality of the disperser 10, and the de-mixer 36<br>
performs an operation complementary to the operation of the<br>
mixer 18. The receiver-side elements 34 and 36, however, do<br>
not always have to process entire codewords, but may also<br>
replace certain interleaving units with erasures, as will<br>
still be explained subsequently, so that the de-interleaver<br>
operations of the elements 34 and 36 then are performed<br>
using erasure information, and not using actually received<br>
interleaving units.<br>
Subsequently, the mixer 18 will be explained in greater<br>
detail.<br>
The mixer is a block interleaver permuting the bits within<br>
a shorter block, e.g. a codeword.<br>
In an interleaver scheme with a disperser, the de-mixer<br>
serves to distribute the burst errors inevitably occurring<br>
behind the de-disperser due to the IU-wise de-interleaving<br>
as favorably as possible over a block, e.g. uniformly over<br>
a codeword, so that the decoding process provides better<br>
results.<br>
In one embodiment, the interleaving of input bits a[i] to<br>
output bits b[i] takes place corresponding to the following<br>
formula:<br>
b[ij = a[ (CILM_Inc * i) mod codewordLen],<br>
wherein<br>
codewordLen is the cord word length,<br>
CILM_Inc is aconfigurable parameter, and<br>
mod is the modulo operation.<br>
Subsequently, the disperser 10 of Fig. 2, as it is also<br>
generally illustrated in Fig. 1, will be explained.<br>
The actual time interleaver (possibly also employed as<br>
frequency interleaver) is the disperser. It distributes the<br>
blocks (e.g. codewords) output by the mixer over time<br>
(and/or over the frequency). The disperser is a convolution<br>
interleaver not working in bit-wise, but block-wise manner.<br>
Due to the block-wise functioning, the use of a mixer makes<br>
sense (see above).<br>
The advantages of the block-wise interleaving are to be<br>
seen, among other things, in the receiver:<br>
De-interleaving usually takes place by storing the<br>
incoming data in an intermediate store and<br>
subsequently reading in the de-interleaved order.<br>
Storing and reading in block-wise manner allows for<br>
efficient control of the memory. A dynamic random<br>
access memory (RAM) may after all be written to and<br>
read far more quickly in bursts than when accessing<br>
individual bytes non-contiguously. Thereby, in the<br>
case of block-wise interleaving, (a) a slower/cheaper<br>
memory than in the case of bit-wise interleaving can<br>
be provided, or (b) the memory may be shared in better<br>
way with other users (arbitration of a shared memory),<br>
so that less memory packages are necessary. In both<br>
cases, cost savings may be achieved.<br>
Management of the reception data in the de-interleaver<br>
takes place more efficiently: channel state<br>
information (e.g. the estimation of the signal-noise<br>
ratio) only has to be stored per IU, instead of per<br>
each symbol/bit; memory space is saved thereby.<br>
Moreover, IU-wise storage enables the interleaver<br>
management to delete individual IUs when they are not<br>
needed, e.g. when enough "good" (hardly disturbed) IUs<br>
have been received from a codeword, "bad" IUs no<br>
longer have to be stored, and already received ones<br>
can be released easily by means of intelligent<br>
interleaver management. Intelligent interleaver<br>
management here means that an interleaver control unit<br>
keeps side information on each stored IU in a table,<br>
in order to optimize the decoder result and the<br>
necessary memory. The interleaver control unit can<br>
always determine which IUs are needed in the further<br>
decoding process, and which ones are not. For the<br>
decoding, the IUs not stored have to be replaced by<br>
erasures. The de-mixer therefore obtains a number of<br>
erasures for these IUs from the de-disperser.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the principle structure of the convolution<br>
interleaver in the disperser for one embodiment. The<br>
interleaver shown has irregular delay lines.<br>
The disperser includes noIlvTaps parallel delay lines,<br>
wherein noIlvTaps corresponds to the block size at the<br>
mixer output divided by the size of one IU (IU_Len in the<br>
following). The lines are fed one after the other by a de-<br>
multiplexer (DEMUX). The input of this de-multiplexer is a<br>
stream of code bits or symbols from the output of the<br>
mixer. The DEMUX feeds each delay line with exactly one<br>
interleaver unit (IU), which corresponds to IU_Len code<br>
bits or symbols from the output of the mixer. Then, the<br>
DEMUX switches to the next line, and so forth. At the<br>
beginning of a block processed by the mixer (e.g. a<br>
codeword) the DEMUX always switches to the next line (index<br>
0). The end of a block is reached when the DEMUX has fed an<br>
IU into the last line (index noIlvTaps-1).<br>
The interleaver shown may be configured via the seven<br>
parameters of noIlv-Taps, middleStart, lateStart,<br>
tapDiffMult, earlyTapDiff, middleTapDiff, lateTapDiff.<br>
Each line includes delay elements. There are three possible<br>
elements, as can be seen in Fig. 10:<br>
Delay "E" includes tapDiffMult * earlyTapDiff IUs<br>
(i.e. tapDiffMult * earlyTapDiff * IU_Len<br>
bits/symbols)<br>
Delay "M" includes tapDiffMult * middleTapDiff IUs<br>
Delay "L" includes tapDiffMult * lateTapDiff IUs<br>
At the output of the lines, a multiplexer (MUX)collects the<br>
outputs of the delay elements. Its switching of the lines<br>
is perfectly synchronized with the DEMUX.<br>
The output of the MUX thus is a stream of IUs of the<br>
interleaved blocks or codewords.<br>
The IUs in the first line (index 0) are always undelayed.<br>
All other IUs with index 0 
block/codeword are delayed as follows with respect to the<br>
first IU (see also Fig. 10):<br>
o for 0 
blocks/codewords is i * tapDiffMult * earlyTapDiff<br>
o for middleStart 
blocks/codewords is (middleStart-1) * tapDiffMult *<br>
earlyTapDiff + (i - middleStart+1) * tapDiffMult *<br>
middleTapDiff<br>
o for lateStart 
blocks/codewords is (middleStart-1) * tapDiffMult *<br>
earlyTapDiff + (lateStart - middleStart) * tapDiffMult<br>
* middleTapDiff + (i - lateStart+1) * tapDiffMult *<br>
lateTapDiff<br>
For this reason, the first middleStart IUs ("early part")<br>
of the block/codeword are distributed differently in time<br>
than the middle (lateStart - middleStart) IUs ("middle<br>
part") and the last (noIlvTaps - lateSTart) IUs again are<br>
distributed differently:<br>
the distance between IUs of the early part, which<br>
belonged to the same block/codeword prior to the<br>
interleaving, then is tapDiffMult * earlyTapDiff,<br>
the distance between IUs of the middle part is<br>
tapDiffMult * middleTapDiff blocks/codewords<br>
- the distance between IUs of the late part is<br>
tapDiffMult * lateTapDiff blocks/codewords,<br>
By configuring the 7 interleaver parameters, it is possible<br>
to select the appropriate interleaver profile, i.e. a<br>
favorable distribution of the content of a block/codeword<br>
over time (and/or frequency). For example, many IUs may be<br>
transmitted with short delay in the late part, if this is<br>
desirable, or the IUs may be distributed uniformly over a<br>
given time period, or both may be combined, etc.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a preferred embodiment of the previously<br>
described interleaver apparatus, which is also referred to<br>
as disperser. In particular, the interleaver apparatus or<br>
interleaving means of the interleaver apparatus shown in<br>
Fig. 10 includes the input multiplexer 11, which is formed<br>
as de-multiplexer and referred to as DEMUX in Fig. 10.<br>
Furthermore, there is the output multiplexer 12, which is<br>
referred to as MUX in Fig. 10. Between the two multiplexers<br>
11 and 12, there are a plurality of connection lines, which<br>
are subdivided into three groups in the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 10, as already described. The first group is the early<br>
part 12d. The second part is the middle part 12e, and the<br>
third group is the late part 12f.<br>
Each delay line and/or connection line with delay, except<br>
for the very first connection line 12a, has a certain delay<br>
unit, wherein the delay units may, however, be configured<br>
differently in the three groups, namely via the parameter<br>
earlyTapDiff for the group 12d, via the parameter<br>
middleTapDif f for the group 124 and the parameter<br>
lateTapDiff for the group 12f.<br>
Fig. 10 further shows that the delay increases by an<br>
increment (E, M or L) from connection line (Tap) to<br>
connection line, so that e.g. the connection line Tap<br>
middleStart-1 has a number of Tap middleStart-1 delay<br>
elements E. Furthermore, each connection line of the second<br>
group 12e has the same number of delay units E as the last<br>
connection line of the first group, as well as additionally<br>
a number of M-delays increasing from connection line to<br>
connection line. Correspondingly, each connection line of<br>
the late group also has the same number of E delays as the<br>
last connection line of the first group and the same number<br>
of M delays as the last connection line of the second<br>
group, as well as a number of L-delay elements increasing<br>
from connection line to connection line.<br>
The first group and the second group and the third group<br>
each include connection lines, wherein each of these<br>
connection lines, except for the very first connection line<br>
of the first group, has a defined amount of delay or an<br>
integer multiple of the defined amount of delay, wherein<br>
the defined amount of delay, i.e. the increment E, M, L,<br>
may differ from group to group, and, importantly, is<br>
configurable by the individual control parameters, as has<br>
been explained previously. It can be seen from Fig. 10 and<br>
the description of E, M and L that the basic raster is the<br>
length of an interleaving unit, i.e. IU_Len. If an<br>
interleaving unit thus has e.g. 20 symbols, every delay E,<br>
M, L is an integer multiple of this delay, which<br>
corresponds to a length of an interleaving unit IU_Len. The<br>
delay corresponding to an entire interleaving unit is given<br>
by the period duration of the processing clock multiplied<br>
by the number of bits or symbols, wherein the clock is a<br>
bit clock in the case of the processing of bits, and<br>
wherein the clock is a byte clock in the case of the<br>
processing of bytes as symbols.<br>
Subsequently, a particular configuration example will be<br>
illustrated.<br>
FEC Parameter<br>
A turbo code corresponding to the 3GPP2 standard is used as<br>
FEC encoder.<br><br>
Mixer Configuration<br>
codeWordLen is 49152 bits and CILM_Inc is 217.<br>
Disperser Configuration<br>
The following sub-chapters show various configurations<br>
representing different interleaver profiles, and hence<br>
various cases of application.<br>
Equal Spreading (Fig. 11)<br>
The IUs belonging to one block (or codeword) are<br>
distributed equally over time, i.e. the distance between<br>
the IUs is the same at the output of the disperser.<br>
Such a configuration makes sense if the transmission<br>
channel produces random brief interruptions (bad channel<br>
state) and then more or less randomly disturbs the<br>
individual IUs. In particular, this configuration makes<br>
sense at higher code rates.<br>
One possible configuration is to use only the early part,<br>
i.e. middleStart = noIlvTaps.<br>
Early/Late<br>
The IUs of one block are transmitted in two bursts (early<br>
and late), between which there is a time interval in which<br>
no IUs of this block are transmitted or very rarely are.<br>
This configuration should be used if the transmission<br>
channel produces very long interruptions (e.g. when driving<br>
under a bridge or through a tunnel). Here, in the case of<br>
good reception, the early or late part has to be sufficient<br>
on its own so as to be able to decode the block. If this is<br>
the case, the interruption is allowed to be maximally as<br>
long as the interval between early and late, without<br>
failure occurring in the decoding of this block.<br>
For parameterization of this configuration, middleStart and<br>
noIlvTaps-lateStart (number in early and/or late part)<br>
should be greater than lateStart-middleStart (size of the<br>
middle part). For a burst-like transmission, earlyTapDiff<br>
and lateTapDiff should be chosen at zero, while tapDiffMult<br>
and middleTapDiff should be maximal, in order to extend the<br>
IUs as far as possible in the middle part.<br>
Equal/Late (Fig. 12)<br>
Part of the IUs are transmitted in accordance with the<br>
strategy of "equal spreading" (see above), the rest comes<br>
in burst-like manner as the late part.<br>
In this case, the late part has to include a sufficient<br>
number of IUs, so that it alone is sufficient for error-<br>
free decoding, in the case of good reception conditions.<br>
Thus, this interleaver profile is suited for fast access,<br>
so that the access time can be kept low in spite of a long<br>
interleaver. The remaining IUs in the equal part are<br>
supposed to offer the protection from random failures of<br>
IUs (see "equal spreading").<br>
The parameterization may take place in similar way to the<br>
above for the early, middle and late parts.<br>
Early/Equal<br>
This configuration is a temporal mirror image of the<br>
"equal/late" configuration, i.e. there is a burst-like<br>
early part followed by "equal spreading" for the remaining<br>
IUs.<br>
It is the advantage here that the end-to-end delay is<br>
small. At the earliest, it may already be decoded after the<br>
reception of the early part, which is shortly after the<br>
accompanying information has been entered into the<br>
transmitter.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a functional implementation of the receiver<br>
arrangement according to the invention. It receives a<br>
reception signal with interleaved interleaving units, as<br>
output from the multiplexer 32 e.g. from the data stream<br>
with the number i in Fig. 3 and input into the de-disperser<br>
34. These interleaved interleaving units are input into an<br>
interleaving unit detector 40 formed to receive<br>
interleaving units from the signal. The detected<br>
interleaving units are needed to correctly control the de-<br>
disperser 34. Furthermore, according to the invention,<br>
there is disposed a side information estimator 42 either<br>
only communicating with the interleaving unit detector 40<br>
or additionally obtaining the reception signal, or which<br>
may be controlled by another device, such as a channel<br>
estimator. The side information estimator is formed to<br>
estimate information for an extracted interleaving unit<br>
related to a transmission of the entire interleaving units.<br>
The side information estimator 42 and the interleaving unit<br>
detector 40 feed a processor 44 for further processing of<br>
the interleaving units, using the side information<br>
determined for ah entire interleaving unit and provided<br>
from the block 42. Hence, in the preferred embodiment, the<br>
processor 44 combines the functionalities of the de-<br>
disperser 34 and the de-mixer 36 of Fig. 3. In preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, it does, however,<br>
include further functionalities to enhance the efficiency<br>
of the receiver, as will be explained with reference to<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
In particular, the processor 44 then checks, when it has<br>
obtained the side information for an interleaving unit, as<br>
to whether reception quality better than a threshold is<br>
assigned to the interleaving unit (step 50). If this<br>
question is answered in the negative, the entire<br>
interleaving unit is discarded (step 52), which may for<br>
example be implemented, in particular, by storing nothing<br>
in a memory, but simply characterizing the discarded<br>
interleaving units with erasures, i.e. e.g. with<br>
probability information signaling 50 % probability for a 0<br>
or a 1, when the de-dispersing is taking place.<br>
If the question in step 50 is answered in the affirmative,<br>
however, such an interleaving unit, as set forth in step<br>
54, is stored in a receiver memory implementing the de-<br>
disperser functionality 34 by reading from the memory in<br>
different way than it has been written to. Yet, if it has<br>
already been determined that enough interleaving units of<br>
good quality for a codeword have been received, such that<br>
correct decoding of the codeword may already be performed<br>
without receiving all interleaving units of the codeword,<br>
it is checked whether an interleaving unit having worse<br>
quality than the interleaving unit presently considered is<br>
stored in the receiver memory. If such an interleaving unit<br>
is found, it is overwritten with the currently detected,<br>
newer, better-quality interleaving unit. If it is<br>
determined, however, that all stored interleaving units<br>
have better quality, and if it is also determined that<br>
enough interleaving units have already been received, the<br>
interleaving unit having relatively good quality due to the<br>
estimated side information nevertheless is discarded, since<br>
it is no longer needed.<br>
In this respect, in a step 56, it is checked whether enough<br>
interleaving units are stored, which means whether correct<br>
decoding of a codeword can already take place. If this<br>
question is answered in the affirmative, the decoding is<br>
started in a step 58, i.e., the codeword is supplied to the<br>
de-mixer 36 if such a de-mixer is present, or the codeword<br>
is directly fed into the FEC decoder 38 if a de-mixer 36 of<br>
Fig. 3 is not present, wherein erasures are inserted for<br>
interleaving units which have been discarded or no longer<br>
stored. If it is determined at the same time in a step 60<br>
that memory is still available, it may already be started,<br>
in this receiver memory for improving the time duration<br>
occurring in the case of a program switch, to store<br>
interleaving units of another program in parallel in the<br>
memory (step 62), so that - in the optimal case - the<br>
second program is also stored in the memory completely<br>
regarding codewords, such that switching from one program<br>
to another program is done directly, i.e. without and an<br>
end-to-end delay actually given by the long convolution<br>
interleaver.<br>
All this becomes possible since it is no longer worked in a<br>
simple-wise or bit-wise manner anymore, according to the<br>
invention, but it is worked in interleaving-unit-wise<br>
manner, so that only quality information has to be<br>
processed in interleaving-unit-wise manner. Moreover, a<br>
reception memory may be read out in interleaving-unit-wise<br>
manner, i.e., in burst-like manner, whereby not only the<br>
de-disperser operation is accelerated significantly when<br>
using a normal RAM memory, but whereby also read-out<br>
enhancement takes place when using any other memory, since<br>
adjacent memory addresses can be read out in a burst to<br>
acquire the individual symbols present in an interleaving<br>
unit, so that the de-disperser operation is executed.<br>
Moreover, clear signaling can be maintained, because the<br>
number of time information to be managed no longer has to<br>
be generated, managed and applied in bit-wise manner, but<br>
only in interleaving-unit-wise manner, which contributes to<br>
a 128-fold reduction in the information to be managed if an<br>
interleaving unit comprises e.g. 128 bits or more. Thus,<br>
the accuracy indeed is reduced, since one no longer has<br>
quality information per bit, but only per interleaving<br>
unit, i.e. in rougher granularity. However, this is not<br>
critical, since such exact quality information is not<br>
needed and/or such quality information in this fine<br>
granularity is not always that expressive anyway. According<br>
to the invention, the acquisition of quality information<br>
therefore is optionally tuned to the interleaver, such that<br>
the complexity of the channel estimator may also be reduced<br>
equally in the case of reduced complexity, without having<br>
to put up with quality losses.<br>
Subsequently, the decoder strategies indicated on the basis<br>
of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 will be detailed. Since the channel<br>
state is determined earlier for each IU, this side<br>
information in the de-disperser may be used to control the<br>
further decoding steps therewith. A memory-optimized<br>
implementation may be as follows:<br>
The use of low-rate codes in a time-varying transmission<br>
channel enables that only the "good" (little disturbed) IUs<br>
have to be stored. IUs with low signal quality do not have<br>
to be stored. As an example, the use of a rate 1/4 code,<br>
the codewords of which consist of 96 Ius, is to be<br>
mentioned. In the case of very good reception, about 30 %<br>
of the IUs are sufficient to be able to decode this code,<br>
i.e., the 25 % of the code needed for representation of the<br>
information in a rate 1/4 code plus 5 % redundancy so that<br>
the decoder can work correctly. If the strategy "only the<br>
best IUs are stored" is pursued, the necessary memory may<br>
be reduced as much as 30 %. Correspondingly, not 96 IUs,<br>
but only the 30 % * 96 = 29 IUs for which the best channel<br>
state was estimated are stored for each codeword. If 29 IUs<br>
are already stored and another one better than the worst<br>
one previously received is received, this bad one is simply<br>
replaced by the better one. This is done by a suitable<br>
interleaver control unit in the disperser.<br>
A similar strategy is of particular interest in connection<br>
with Diversity Combining or in case the multiplexer<br>
includes various programs.<br>
Concept 1:<br>
As many IUs as are needed for the decoding are stored<br>
by the selected program (see example above).<br>
The rest is used for other programs so that a quick<br>
program change becomes possible (see fast access).<br>
Thereby, the existing memory is utilized optimally.<br>
Concept 2:<br>
In the case of Diversity Combining, only the good IUs<br>
are stored early. Hereby, the necessary memory is made<br>
smaller.<br>
An alternatively or additionally applied strategy optimized<br>
for energy consumption may be as follows:<br>
If enough "good" IUs have been received, the receiver can<br>
be switched off. The receiver thus continuously measures<br>
the quality of the received IUs. If enough IUs with good<br>
signal quality have been received, the remaining ones are<br>
no longer needed and can be replaced with "erasure". If<br>
e.g. the transmission system is formed so that a certain<br>
range (maximum distance between transmitter and receiver)<br>
is allowed, all receivers closer to the transmitter receive<br>
the data with higher quality. Thus, the receivers no longer<br>
need all IUs for error free decoding. If individual IUs are<br>
no longer needed, the accompanying parts of the receiver<br>
may be switched off briefly again and again. Thereby, the<br>
period of operation in portable devices is prolonged, since<br>
the mean power consumption is reduced. The management of<br>
the data is simplified substantially by the chosen<br>
interleaver structure.<br>
A strategy optimized by fast access is served optimally if<br>
the interleaver is configured for a strong late part, i.e.,<br>
if the third group of the disperser of Fig. 10 is weighted<br>
strongly.<br>
In the case of a convolution interleaver it is true that<br>
the sum of the length of the delay line in the transmitter<br>
and in the receiver is equal for all tabs. If the delay<br>
line is chosen to be long in the transmitter, the delay<br>
line is correspondingly short in the receiver. A long delay<br>
line in the transmitter means that the accompanying data<br>
are transmitted later (= "late"). A short delay line in the<br>
receiver means a short delay, however. The accompanying<br>
bits thus are available at the output of the de-disperser<br>
after a short delay time (= faster access = "fast access").<br>
This configuration is particularly advantageous when using<br>
a relatively low code rate for the FEC encoder.<br>
In summary, the present invention thus includes an<br>
interleaver apparatus implementing the functionality of a<br>
convolution interleaver in the interleaving means, which<br>
works in interleaving-unit-wise manner, wherein an<br>
interleaving unit includes more than one symbol. The number<br>
of bits per symbol here corresponds to the symbol length of<br>
the FEC encoder.<br>
The inventive interleaver structure therefore has the<br>
feature that a codeword is decomposed into a series of<br>
smaller data packets, i.e., interleaving units. An<br>
interleaving unit includes more than one information symbol<br>
and preferably at least 128 information symbols. These<br>
interleaving units are distributed to various connection<br>
lines with different delays via a de-multiplexer, wherein<br>
the connection lines and/or delay lines have various<br>
lengths, or implement various delays in some way, for<br>
example by FIFO memories. After the corresponding delay,<br>
the output-side multiplexer multiplexes the output of the<br>
connection lines into a data stream again, which is then<br>
fed to a modulator, in order to finally generate an RF<br>
output signal.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, a mixer is connected upstream<br>
of the disperser. With this, the disadvantage of the<br>
grouping in interleaving units introduced at first sight is<br>
compensated for. Yet, particularly for FEC codes, which<br>
still have relatively good properties also without a mixer,<br>
an implementation capable of doing without the mixer for<br>
complexity reasons both on transmitter side and on receiver<br>
side also is preferred.<br>
If the mixer is used, it functions as a block interleaver,<br>
which is connected upstream of the interleaving means and<br>
re-sorting the data bits or data symbols of a codeword<br>
individually, i.e., in a symbol-wise or bit-wise manner.<br>
For improving the decoder functionality, at first the<br>
channel state is determined on the decoder side for each<br>
interleaving unit. Hereupon, then the series of<br>
interleaving units together with the channel state<br>
information are brought into the original order via the de-<br>
disperser. The output of the de-interleaver, together with<br>
the channel state information, then is processed further by<br>
the FEC decoder. As explained on the basis of Fig. 10, the<br>
disperser is a configurable disperser having several parts<br>
the length of which in interleaving units and the temporal<br>
extension of which with respect to the delays in the<br>
respective parts can be chosen differently depending on the<br>
requirement. The configuration of the disperser in three<br>
segments, namely an early segment, a middle segment and a<br>
late segment, is a special implementation. For certain<br>
applications, an early-late configuration or an equal-late<br>
configuration may be expedient, wherein a low-rate FEC code<br>
and a strong late part are preferred in the latter<br>
configuration to allow for fast access. Alternative<br>
configurations are the early/equal configuration or the<br>
complementary disperser configuration in the case of<br>
transmit diversity. On the decoder side, a decoder<br>
algorithm is preferred, which files interleaving units that<br>
are good and needed for the decoding in the memory, while<br>
worse ones are replaced with better interleaving units or<br>
worse interleaving units are not stored. The interleaving<br>
units are not stored either if the channel is better than<br>
planned. Unavailable interleaving units here are regarded<br>
as "erasures".<br>
The functionality may be used particularly for improved<br>
energy management, which is of particular advantage to<br>
mobile devices that are battery operated and the activity<br>
duration of which may be increased therewith. Particularly<br>
when enough good interleaving units have been received, the<br>
corresponding receiver part is switched off to save battery<br>
current.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive methods may<br>
be implemented in hardware or in software. The<br>
implementation may be on a digital storage medium, in<br>
particular a disk or CD having electronically readable<br>
control signals capable of cooperating with a programmable<br>
computer system such that a method will be executed. In<br>
general, the invention thus also consists in a computer<br>
program product having a program code stored on a machine-<br>
readable carrier for performing the method when the<br>
computer program product is executed on a computer. In<br>
other words, the invention may thus also be realized as a<br>
computer program having a program code for performing the<br>
method when the computer program is executed on a computer.<br>

interval.<br>
31. Receiver according to one of claims 23 to 30, wherein<br>
the signal goes back to a coding at a code rate equal<br>
to or smaller than 0.5, and wherein a late time<br>
interval has a proportion of interleaving units so<br>
great that the number of interleaving units in the<br>
late time interval is already sufficient for decoding<br>
at a certain error rate in the case of a certain<br>
channel quality.<br>
32. Method of receiving a signal derived from a block of<br>
symbols using a redundancy-adding coding, and based on<br>
a codeword comprising a sequence of interleaving<br>
units, wherein the sequence of interleaving units has<br>
been changed, wherein an order of the symbols within<br>
an interleaving unit has not been changed, and wherein<br>
at least one interleaving unit of a previous or<br>
subsequent codeword is arranged between two<br>
interleaving units of the codeword, or wherein an<br>
order of interleaving units in the interleaved<br>
codeword is different from an order of interleaving<br>
units prior to the interleaving, comprising:<br>
detecting (40) interleaving units from the signal;<br>
estimating (42) side information for an interleaving<br>
unit related to a transmission of the entire<br>
interleaving unit; and<br>
further processing (44) the interleaving unit on the<br>
basis of the side information determined for the<br>
respective entire interleaving unit.<br>
33. Computer program with a program code for performing<br>
the method according to claim 22 or 32, when the<br>
method is executed on a computer.<br>
A convolution interleaver for processing a codeword derived<br>
from an input block of symbols using a redundancy-adding<br>
coding (22), and having more symbols than the input block,<br>
wherein the codeword has a sequence of interleaving units,<br>
wherein each interleaving unit has at least two symbols,<br>
includes interleaving means (10). The interleaving means<br>
changes the sequence of interleaving units to obtain an<br>
interleaved codeword having a changed sequence of<br>
interleaving units. In particular, the order of the symbols<br>
within an interleaving unit is not changed by the<br>
interleaving means. The order of the interleaving units in<br>
the codeword among each other or with respect to a previous<br>
or subsequent codeword is changed, however.</td>
