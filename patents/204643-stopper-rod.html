THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10,rule 13]<br>
"STOPPER ROD"<br>
VESUVIUS   CRUCIBLE   COMPANY,   of  Suite   200,   Foulk   Road   103, Wilmington, Delaware 19803, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a new stopper rod for regulating the flow of a molten metal from a pouring group, for example, steel or cast iron, from a distributor or a casting ladle, and more particularly a one-piece stopper rod that has means for attachment to a lifting mechanism. In a particular embodiment, the stopper rod also has means for introducing an inert gas, such as argon, into the molten metal bath during continuous casting operations.<br>
Such a stopper rod and its use are well known to the skilled artisan, in particular by U.S. Patents 4,946,083 and 5,024,422 to which reference is made. Among others, these documents describe a one-piece stopper rod that can be attached to a lifting mechanism, comprised of:<br>
a)	an elongated body of refractory material that has a borehole positioned<br>
coaxiaUy with respect to the body of the stopper rod and adapted to fixedly<br>
receive a metal rod for its attachment to a lifting mechanism. The axial borehole<br>
of the body of refractory material has an enlarged part with an annular sealing<br>
surface spaced away from the upper end of the body of refractory material. The<br>
means for attachment of the metal rod are generally positioned between the<br>
enlarged part and the lower end of the body of refractory material. At its lower<br>
end, the body of<br>
refractory material may have means for introducing gas into the molten metal bath;<br>
and<br>
b)	an elongated metal rod attached to the body of refractory material and<br>
having an axial borehole communicating in its lower part with the borehole of<br>
the body of refractory material. The rod has a collar carrying an annular sealing<br>
surface facing the annulaf sealing surface of the body of refractory material to<br>
create a gas tight seal. The upper end of the rod is adapted to be attached to a<br>
lifting mechanism that permits the vertical displacement of the stopper rod<br>
inside of a pouring group such as a distributor. Means for fastening to the body<br>
of refractory material are generally positioned between the collar and the lower<br>
end of the metal rod.<br>
The stopper rod may be connected to a gas supply line, generally but not obligatorily, through the upper end of the rod.<br>
When such a stopper rod is used, the gas introduced is conveyed to the axial borehole of the body of refractory material in its lower part. Thanks to the means for introducing gas into the molten metal bath, that the body of refractory material has in its lower part, the stopper rod permits the introduction of gas into the molten metal bath. The annular sealing surfaces of the rod and the body of refractory material facing each other prevent substantial losses of inert gas and the infiltration of air.<br>
To improve this tightness even more, it was proposed to place an annular gas tight<br><br><br>
gasket between these sealing surfaces.  U.S. Patent 4,946,083, for example, indicates<br>
that when a gasket with a thickness of ca. 0.4 mm and of material resistant to high<br>
temperatures, e.g., graphite, is in place, the interface between the annular sealing<br>
surfaces of the rod and the body of refractory material furnishes a tightness capable of<br>
resisting a pressure up to 3 bars.<br>
This seal is essential for casting high-grade molten metal.  In the first place, it is<br>
necessary to assure a good protection against the infiltration of air responsible for<br>
oxidizing the molten metal during pouring. On the other hand, when an inert gas is<br>
injected through the stopper rod, it is also indispensable to minimize the losses of inert<br>
gas that cause production cost overruns that are far from negligible.<br>
The system in use at the present time still do not however furnish a completely<br>
satisfactory solution for these two points of view.<br>
In pursuing his research in this domain, the applicant discovered that these problems<br>
are due to the fact that, for different reasons (unscrewing of the rod, expansion of the<br>
rod, ...), a loss of tightness could occur at the sealing joint between the annular sealing<br>
surfaces of the rod and the body of refractory material facing each other.<br>
The applicant then discovered that the tightness of the stopper rod could be improved<br>
by using a body of refractory material of a particular type.<br>
According to the present invention, a stopper having a body of refractory material in<br>
one piece, constituted at least partially of a refractory material relatively impermeable<br>
to gases is used.<br>
The present invention thus concerns a one-piece stopper rod that can be attached to a<br>
lifting mechanism, comprised of:<br>
(a)	an elongated body of refractory material, that has<br>
(i)	a borehole positioned coaxially with respect to the body of the stopper rod and<br>
adapted to receive in a fixed manner a metal rod for its attachment to a lifting mechanism, the axial borehole of the body of refractory material having enlarged part that presents an annular sealing surface spaced away from the upper end of the body of refractory material;<br>
(ii)	means for attaching the said metal rod; and<br>
(b)	an elongated metal rod attached to the body of refractory material adapted at its<br>
upper end to be attached to a lifting mechanism for vertically displacing the<br>
stopper rod inside of a pouring group; that is characterized in that the said body of<br>
refractory material is comprised at least partially of a refractory material relatively<br>
impermeable to gases.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the stopper rod can be connected to a gas supply line. Therefore, said elongated body of refractory material has, at its lower end, means for introducing gas into the molten metal bath and said metal rod has an axial borehole communicating in its lower part with the borehole of<br><br>
the body of refractory material.<br>
By material relatively impermeable to gas, is meant a material whose specific<br><br>
permeability (expressed in m2 ) in the vicinity of the working temperature of the stopper rod is less than that of the  materials conventionally used.  Preferably, the specific permeability in the vicinity of the working temperature of the stopper rod of relatively impermeable refractory material is less than half that of the materials conventionally used. The conventional materials generally have a specific permeability between 5.10-17 and 5.10-16m2. The relatively impermeable materials that are preferred according to the present invention have a specific permeability less than 5.10       m . Suitable refractory materials relatively impermeable to gases are chosen among mixtures in which additives capable of reducing the mean diameter of the pores have been incorporated. These additives are well known to the skilled in the art.  For example, fluxing agents such  as the alkalis (Na2O, K2O, CaO, B203, ...), silicas etc. can be incorporated into the composition of the refractory material.  Metallic elements that form carbides when brought to high temperature can also be incorporated.  It is also possible to define the mean diameter of the pores by implementing a powdered composition whose granulometry is chosen to reduce the mean pore diameter. Obviously, one or more of these methods can be combined.  Preferably fluxing agents are incorporated in the composition ofihe refractory material.<br>
The applicant has found that it was uneasy to obtain a refractory material presenting a good compromise between the properties of impermeability and resistance to corrosion by molten steel. Thus, according to a particular embodiment of the invention, the body of refractory material is comprised of at least two different refractory materials; the body of refractory material having a first part comprised of a mixture relatively impermeable to the gases that substantially surrounds the region in which the sealing gasket is located and a second part comprised of refractory material resistant to corrosion by the molten metals. According to this embodiment, the part of the body of refractory material in contact with the molten metal is preferably comprised essentially of a refractory material resistant to corrosion, while the part comprised of a mixture relatively impermeable to the gases substantially surrounding the region in which the sealing joint is located is not in contact with the molten metal. In this case, material relatively impermeable to gas is understood to be a material whose specific permeability in the vicinity of the working temperature of the stopper rod is less than that of the material or materials resistant to corrosion.  Preferably, the specific permeability in the vicinity of the working temperature of the stopper rod of relatively impermeable refractory material is less than half that of the corrosion-resistant material.<br>
Conventional corrosion-resistant materials generally have a specific permeability between 5.10-17 and 5.10-16   m . The relatively impermeable materials preferred<br><br>
according to the present invention have a specific permeability less than 5.10"17 m2.<br>
The body of refractory material according to the present invention can be prepared by<br>
any of the conventional techniques well known to the skilled artisan; in particular, this<br>
body of refractory material can be prepared by cold or hot pressing or even by isostatic<br>
pressing.  For reasons of facilitation, in the case where the body of refractory material<br>
is comprised of several different refractory materials, it is preferable to press at least<br>
one of the parts previously, generally the part that is less accessible. As a general rule,<br>
it is thus preferable to press that part of the body of refractory material enveloping the<br>
region in which the sealing gasket is located beforehand.<br>
The stopper rod involved in the present patent application is essentially similar to that<br>
described in the U.S. Patents 4,946,083 and 5,024,422, to which reference is made.<br>
As a variant, it is also possible to use a stopper rod that also has means for<br>
maintaining the compression of the sealing gasket in contact with the annular sealing<br>
surface of the body of refractory material as described in our Belgian patent application<br>
filed on the same day as the present patent application.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are fragmentary views in cross section of the upper end of a stopper<br>
rod according to these modes of implementing the invention.<br>
On these Figures, the stopper rod 1 is comprised of an elongated body of refractory<br>
material 2 with an axial borehole 4 extending from its upper end 4 to its lower end (not<br>
shown). The body of refractory material is provided with means for introducing inert<br>
gas (not shown) into the metal bath.<br>
The body of refractory material also has means 5 for attaching a metal rod 6. The<br>
metal rod 6 also has an axial borehole 7 that passes through it from its upper end 8 to<br>
its lower end 9. The upper end 8 is adapted to receive a connector (not shown) for<br>
supplying an inert gas.  Furthermore, the upper end 8 of the rod is adapted to be<br>
attached to a lifting mechanism (not shown). A gas under pressure, such as argon, is<br>
introduced into the axial borehole 3 of the body of refractory material by means of the<br>
rod 6 and is conveyed to the metal bath through the lower end of the body of refractory<br>
material.<br>
The body of refractory material 2 has an enlarged part 10 that forms a sealing surface.<br>
Two graphite gaskets (11 and 11'J rest on this sealing surface and thus prevent the<br>
infiltration of air or losses of inert gas.<br>
The body of refractory material 2 is comprised of two different refractory materials; the<br>
body of refractory material is comprised of a first part 16 composed of a mixture<br>
relatively impermeable to the gases substantially surrounding the region in which the<br>
sealing gaskets 11 (and 11) are located, and a second part 17 composed of a refractory<br>
material resistant to corrosion by the molten metals.<br>
In Figure 1, the metal rod 6 has a collar 12 that carries an annular sealing surface<br>
facing the annular sealing surface 10 of the borehole of the body of refractory material<br><br>
so as to create a seal against gases.<br>
In Figure 2, the sleeve 14 is fitted on the rod 6 and maintains the gaskets 11 and 11*<br>
under compression. The upper part of the sleeve is blocked by a washer 13, it in turn<br>
being retained by a nut 15.<br>
The washer 13 is preferably in contact with the upper end 4 of the body of refractory<br>
material 2 to give the assembly an increased rigidity.<br>
The sleeve 14 is comprised of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion<br>
greater than that of the metal rod 6 and a length sufficient so that, under the effect of<br>
the temperature to which the stopper rod is brought during pouring, it expands<br>
sufficiently toward the lower end of the metal rod to at least compensate for the<br>
expansion of the metal rod.<br>
Preferably, the expansion of the sleeve compensates essentially precisely for the<br>
expansion of the metal rod.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the sleeve 14 can project at the upper end of the body of<br>
refractory material 2 if this is necessary to permit a sufficient length of the sleeve.<br>
The sleeve 14 is fitted on the metal rod 6 and forms with it a free assembly, turning,<br>
sliding or just sliding. The upper end of the sleeve 14 just butts on blocking means 13<br>
and 15 located fixedly on the metal rod 6 so that, under the effect of expansion, the<br>
sleeve 14 lengthens axially only in the direction opposite the said blocking means.<br>
The material constituting the sleeve as well as its length are chosen as a function of<br>
the dimensions of the materials constituting the metal rod (generally machined from a<br>
steel bar with a coefficient of thermal expansion of the order of 12.5(µm°C-1 ) and the<br>
body of refractory material (typically comprised of a refractory material obtained by<br>
isostatic pressing with a coefficient of thermal expansion of 3-6µm°C-1   ).<br>
The material constituting the sleeve as well as its length are easily determined from the<br>
basic principles of thermal physics.<br>
Starting with the values thus determined in the first approximation and which<br>
generally furnish excellent results, it is then possible to optimize the system by trial<br>
and error without any difficulty.<br>
According to the invention, the sleeve is comprised of a material with a high coefficient<br>
of thermal expansion capable of resisting the elevated temperatures to which the<br>
stopper rod is subjected during pouring.  For example, refractory materials with a high<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion such as fritted magnesia can be used. The preferred<br>
materials for this application are found among metals or metal alloys with a high<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion and having a high melting point.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the stopper rod also has means<br>
for preventing the metal rod from separating from the body of refractory material.<br>
Such means are described in the Belgian patent application No. 9800838 to which<br>
reference is made. Thus, if a metal insert having a threaded axial internal borehole<br><br>
anchored in the body of refractory material is used as the means for attaching the rod to the body of refractory material, the rod will be prevented from becoming unscrewed from the insert by furnishing it with a pair of parallel plane surfaces at the point of emergence from the body of refractory material and by supporting on these plane surfaces an integral forked flange joined fixedly to the body of refractory material. This fixed joint can be accomplished by a pin inserted in a shaft effected through the forked flange and extending into the body of refractory material.<br><br>
