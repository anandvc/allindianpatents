				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a geometrical instrument for constructing regular polygons namely Pentagon, hexagon, heptagon,octagon etc. of given side lengths in convenient incremental steps.<br>
Presently regular polygons are usually constructed by using set-squares and compass. Such construction methods are given in Text Books like " Elementary Engineering drawings" by N.D. Bhatt.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system of constructing polygons.<br>
One of the main disadvantages is that it is time consuming and inaccurate and requires lot of practice and memorization of the construction process or steps.<br>
Another disadvantage with the present system of constructing polygons is that it is necessary to follow the step by step construction methods given in the text books and omission of any one such steps usually results in irregular polygons.<br>
Yet another disadvantage with the present system of constructing polygons is that it is necessary to use at least two instruments, namely set square or ruler and compass and unwanted construction lines are to be erased after completion of the figure thereby deteriorating the appearance of the drawing.<br>
Still another disadvantages associated with the present system of constructing polygons is that it demands a lot of effort and time to construct regular polygons.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention of a geometrical instrument for constructing regular polygons which is simple and accurate and requires minimum construction time.<br>
Another object of the present invention of a geometrical instrument for constructing regular polygon which is small enough to carry in the instrument box presently being used.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention of a geometrical instrument for constructing a regular polygon of standard sizes and can be adapted for a specific size. The same instrument can be used for at least 8 sizes of polygons having 5 to atleast 9 sides. The sizes and sides can be further adapted simply by drilling a pin hole at a suitable point of the instrument.<br>
Still another object of the present invention of a geometrical instrument for constructing a regular polygon is that there is no fixed construction method to be followed and once the user is conscious of how to use it, the operation gets very simple and easy.<br>
Further object of the present invention of a geometrical instrument for constructing a regular polygon is that after construction of the polygon there are no superfluous lines to be erased and as such the drawing is neat and clear.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a geometrical instrument for constructing regular polygon comprising a lightweight transparent sheet having two horizontal sides of which one side is the base of the instrument having<br>
_3_<br><br>
two vertical sides that join to the said top horizontal line at an angle of 30° and 45° respectively, said instrument having plurality of vertical lines at a predetermined steps starting from a point at the left hand side of the base of the said instrument, said vertical lines are provided with pin holes for five to nine sided polygons said instrument is operated by rotatably fixing at any one of the said pin holes at any one of the vertical lines with a holding device having a pin with a flat head.<br>
This invention particularly provides a geometrical instrument for constructing regular polygon comprising a lightweight transparent sheet having two horizontal sides (CD, AF) of which the side (CD) is the base of the instrument having two vertical sides (CB, DE) and joining to said top horizontal line (AF) at an angle of 30° and 45° respectively, said<br>
instrument having plurality of vertical lines   (a1, a2 	 k1 k2)   at a<br>

The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 - shows a polygon for relationship between radius and the<br>
quantities 11 n and G.<br>
Figure 2 - shows the top, side and front views of the instrument. Figure 3 - shows details of the holding device and the center pin<br>
holes on the main device. Figure 4 - shows details of another embodiment of the holding<br>
device. Figure 5 -   shows details of the centre pin holes of the main device<br>
corresponding to the holding device of Figure 4.<br>
Summary of the present invention:<br>
A regular polygon being a figure with one unique centre, the shape and size depends upon the following quantities.<br>
(i)      The number of sides of the polygon (say, n)<br>
-    5    -<br><br>
(ii)The length of each sides of the polygon ( say, 1), and (iii)The included angle of each sides at the centre (say, ).<br>
For  a  given  polygon,  the  above  quantities  namely  (1' and 'n' are known and <br>
Since every regular polygon can be contained inside a circle with common centre, hence it is natural to assume that a relationship between the radius of the circle or the polygon and the quantities 1, n and   must exist. On this basis an assumption is made that the length of the side of a polygon is approximately equal to the arc subtended by the angle ' ' and with this approach, the following relationships are derived.<br>
( See Fig. 1).<br>
- 6-<br>
Length of each sides of the polygons,<br><br><br>
Meanwhile several possible solutions were generated and based upon eqn.- (2) , a prototype of the choosen solution was made and tested. It was found that the device could not draw the desired polygon and the first failure was encountered.<br>
On re-examining the above equation and carefully studying the Fig. (1), the errors are easily detected and the correct relationship between the said quantities are as follows:<br><br>
Now using eqn - (4) and corrected to two decimal places,<br>
the different lengths of the altitute (x) for different polygons<br>
are       obtained       in       table       -       1       below.<br>
-7-<br><br>
TABLE - 1 : LENGTH OF ALTITUDES (x)<br><br>
PRACTICAL USE OF THE INVENTED INSTRUMENT:-.<br>
The instrument sequences may be followed to efficiently use the device to construct the reuired polygon whose no. of sides and length of the sides are given.<br>
(i) Out of the eight possible side lengths vi. 10mm, 20mm, 25mm, 30mm, 35mm, 40mm, 50mm and 60mm select the perpendicular at the mid-centre of the desired side length. This perpendicular with holes along it are the corresponding altitude of the triangles inside the desired polygon.<br>
The pin- holes on these perpendiculars are numbered as 5, 6, 7, 8 etc. and. hole No. 5 corresponds to the centre of a pentagon no. 6 corresponds to the centre of a hexagon of the given side lengths and so on.<br>
-8-<br><br>
(ii) Insert the centre pin at the appropriate centre hole and keeping the device at the desired position, draw the first side of the polygon about the division edge (CD) equal to the reuired side length.<br>
(iii) Keeping the position of the centre pin fixed, rotate the device about it such that the end point of the first side line already drawn becomes the starting point for drawing the second side of the polygon.<br>
Repeat process step (iii)  till the polygon is closed with the required number of sides. When the polygon is closed the  construction  is  completed  and  thus  regular  polygons would be obtained. ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF USING THE INVENTION:<br>
-9-<br>
As we can see from eqn - (iii) , there are three variables, viz r, 1 and 9 and in the chosen solution, the instrument is based on the length of the altitude given by<br><br><br>
However,  it  is  also  possible  to  construct  similar polygons by using the included angle (9) as the base (concept-E is based on this method). This instrument is more complicated requires  many  parts  and  is  more  delicate  than  the  chosen concept. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
(Figure 2) illustrate an instrument which is made from<br>
acryllic sheet of around 2mm to 5mm in thickness. The present<br>
embodiment of the instrument of 3mm thickness is for<br>
construction of polygons of sies 10mm to 60mm in steps of 10mm<br>
i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60mm and 35mm and 25mm. Each<br>
vertical lines erected on the edge of the base of the instru<br>
ment  (CD),  namely,  b1,  b2 ,  c1 c2	j1 j2 have five pin<br>
holes each for a polygon having the number of sides 5 to 9.<br>
In the horiontal base ( reference line) CD has a margin for   accuracy   at   both   ends   of   about   2mm   each (i.e.  Ca2 =k2D = 20mm)  and  the  total  length  between  a2k2  is exactly to be 60mm. The whole length a2k2 is graduated at an equal  interval  of  5 mm each and  altitude  lines  like  b1b2 c1c2,  d1d2,  e1e2,  f1f2 and g1g2 are erected on the base CD on the LHS of the device as can be seen in Fig. (2). Now the altitude line b1 b2 is for all polygons having side length of 10mm ( ie. a2c2) and the pin holes numbered 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9  are  for  pentagon,  hexagon,  heptagon,  octagon and Nanogon respectively.  Similarly  the  altitude  line  C1C2  is for all polygons having side length of 20mm (ie. a2e2) and so on. To enable  the  user  recognize the  desired  side  lengths  easily .<br><br><br>
triangles like    -o-10,   -o-20,	 -0-60, etc. are also<br>
printed  on  the  instrument to read 10mm,  20mm,  	 60mm,<br>
etc.  It is not necessary that the letters   ,   	 ,<br>
   and  the  altitude  lines  b1b2,  C1C2'	jl'J2  be shown<br>
on the instrument.<br>
Similarly, the other two altitude lines on the RHS of the device namely, h1 h2 and j1j2 are erected on the base CD at a distance of 17.5mm and 12.5mm from k2 to represent the centre or altitude lines for polygons of 35 mm and 25 ram side lengths respectively. On all these altitude lines namely, b1b2,<br>
C1c2 ,  d1 d2	j1 j2,  the  pin  holes  for  the  device  with<br>
maximum diameter ( d 
-eg - To construct a polygon of 10mm side length of 7 sides polygon i.e. heptagon), the following steps may be followed.<br>
(1)	Hold the main device on a piece of paper where the figure<br>
is to be drawn in the desired position.<br>
(2)	Draw the first line ( a2c2) of 10mm<br>
(3)	Holding the main device in the previous position, now insert<br>
the pin of the holding device at the hole numbered 7 on the<br>
altitude line b1 b2 and rotate the main device alone about the<br>
pin  till  the  point  a2  of  the instrument coincides with the<br>
end point of the previously drawn line.<br><br>
- 11 - .<br><br>
Now draw the second line of the open polygon.<br>
(4) Repeat the above step No. (3) till the polygon is closed and a regular heptagon would be obtained.<br>
Figure 3 - and 4 shows details for two types of holding device pin and the centre pin holes on the instrument.<br>
