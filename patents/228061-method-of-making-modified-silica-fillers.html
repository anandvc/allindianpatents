				<td>METHOD OF MAKING MODIFIED SILICA FILLERS<br>
[0001] This invention is related to a method of making a modified silica filler in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of a diorganodihalosilane and a<br>
monoorganotrihalosilane in a weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
[0002] This is an improvement in methods of modifying silica fillers, as described in for<br>
example, US Patent 6384125 (May 7,2002), which is assigned to the same assignee as the<br>
present invention. While the '125 patent refers generally to the use of some similar<br>
organometallic compounds and mixtures thereof as the present invention, and their use as<br>
hydrophobing agents for silica, it does not describe any particular mixture or blend of<br>
chlorosilane compounds as being any more effective than any other blend, nor does the '125<br>
patent identify the existence of any particular ratio of silane compounds as being necessary to<br>
achieve a new and unexpected results, i.e., an ability to deposit more siloxane on silica, vis a<br>
viz, improved hydrophobicity.<br>
[0003] The invention is directed to a method of making modified silica fillers in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of organosilicon compounds. In particular, it is<br>
directed to an improvement in treating silica with blends or mixtures of diorganodihalosilanes<br>
and monoorganotrihalosilanes, in weight ratios of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
[0004] Preferably, the weight ratio is 1:0.3 to 1:1, and most preferably the weight ratio is<br>
1:0.5. Similarly, the blend or mixture is preferably a dialkyldichlorosilane and a<br>
monoalkyltrichlorosilane, and most preferably dimethyldichlorosilane and<br>
methyltrichlorosilane. In some additional embodiments, the blend or mixture may also<br>
comprise compositions containing (i) dimethyldichlorosilane, (ii) n-propyltrichlorosilane,<br>
phenyltrichlorosilane, or cyanopropyltrichlorosilane, and (iii) mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0005] These and other features of the invention will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the detailed description.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
[0006] The silica used to make the modified silica fillers according to this invention are the<br>
colloidal or precipitated silicas of the type used to formulate polymeric compositions such as<br>
rubber, particularly those rubber compositions used in the manufacture of vehicle tires for<br>
improving the mechanical properties of tire rubber. Such silicas are described in much detail<br><br>
in the '125 patent to which reference may be had, and which is considered as being<br>
incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
[0007] Mineral fillers such as silica, having a small particle size and a large surface area,<br>
are capable of increasing the tensile strength of rubber compounds, and therefore are useful<br>
as a reinforcing material for rubber; particularly when the mineral surfaces of the filler are<br>
converted to hydrophobic low energy surfaces. Typically, this is carried out using<br>
methylchlorsilanes which react with the surface water of mineral surfaces or the water<br>
present in a reaction, i.e., hydrolysis and condensation of silanols, liberating hydrochloric<br>
acid and concurrently depositing a very thin film of methylpolysiloxanes with low critical<br>
surface tensions not wetted by water. A very simplified representation is =Si-Cl + H2O→<br>
═SiOH + HC1 → ═Si-O-Si═.<br>
[0008] The silica treating agents according to the invention are blends of<br>
organodichlorosilanes and organotrichlorosilanes. The organodichlorosilanes and<br>
organotrichlorosilanes may contain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl groups, araalkyl (arylalkyl)<br>
groups, alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups, aryl groups, and certain substituted groups which are not<br>
reactive with respect to a silica surface.<br>
[0009] Some examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl,<br>
dodecyl, octadecyl, and nonadecyl. Some examples of cycloalkyl groups are cyclobutyl and<br>
cyclohexyl. Some examples of araalkyl (arylalkyl) groups are benzyl, phenylethyl, and 2-<br>
phenylpropyl. Some examples of alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups are tolyl and mesityl. Some<br>
examples of aryl groups are phenyl, xenyl, naphthyl, and anthracyl. Some examples of<br>
substituted groups which are not reactive with respect to a silica surface are halogenated alkyl<br>
groups and aryl groups such as chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl, 3-<br>
chloropropyl, chlorocyclohexyl, chlorophenyl, and dichloroxenyl; alkyl groups containing<br>
alkoxy radicals such as methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, and pentoxy; alkyl groups containing<br>
sulfldo (-S-), disulfido, or polysulfido radicals; and alkyl groups containing cyano (-C═N)<br>
radicals.<br>
[0010] Representative of some organodichlorosilanes and organotrichlorosilanes which can<br>
be used according to this invention are n-butylmethyldichorosilane,<br>
t-butylmethyldichorosilane, t-butylphenyldichorosilane, n-butyltrichlorosilane,<br><br>
t-butyltrichlorosilane, cyclohexylmethyldichorosilane, cyclohexyltrichlorosilane,<br>

[0011] A general method of making modified silica fillers according to the invention is<br>
described below in Example A, although the modified silica fillers can be made by any<br>
known and accepted technique, for example, as described in detail in the '125 patent, in US<br>
Patent 5908660 (June 1,1999), and in US Patent 6051672 (April 18, 2000). While these<br>
patents describe general methods, they fail to describe the features of this invention, i.e., the<br>
use of a particular mixture or blend of chlorosilane compounds in a particular ratio.<br>
[0012] When used in rubber compositions for manufacturing vehicle tires, other<br>
conventional additives may be used along with the modified silica filler, including other<br>
fillers such as carbon black, various oils, plasticizers, accelerators, antioxidants, heat<br>
stabilizers, light stabilizers, zone stabilizers, extenders, and coloring pigments.<br>
[0013] The following examples are set forth in order to illustrate the invention in more<br>
detail. The silica slurry used in the examples contained 6.5 percent by weight of silica, and is<br>
a commercial product of PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Neutralization was<br>
carried out by using a standard solution containing 25 percent by weight of sodium<br>
hydroxide, and it was prepared by dissolving 1000 grams of sodium hydroxide pellets in<br>
3000 millilitre of deionized water.<br><br>
[0014] The apparatus used in treating the silica consisted of a 5-liter round-bottom reaction<br>
flask, with ball joints, a Teflon® shaft stirring paddle assembly, an overhead electrical<br>
stirring motor, and a Type-K thermocouple temperature controller with a flexible heating<br>
mantle. The reaction flask was surmounted with a Dean-Stark trap and water cooler<br>
condenser with a port for a sealed glass thermocouple well directly submersed into the<br>
reaction flask. The third neck of the reaction flask was sealed with a ball-joint cap or an<br>
addition funnel. Filtration and washing of treated silica fillers and silica filler cakes was<br>
conducted with a 253 mm Coors Porcelain Buchner funnel containing Whatman filter paper.<br>
The funnel was mounted on a 4-liter filter flask. A Fisher brand Digital Conductivity Meter<br>
was used to measure the conductivity of the filtrate from the washing process. A Mettler<br>
Toledo Portable pH\Ion Meter, Model No. MP125 was used to measure pH.<br>
[0015] The following procedure, used in Example 5, represents the general procedure<br>
which was repeated in the other Examples 1-4 and 6-10. Data for each of the Examples 1-10<br>
is shown in Table 1.<br>
0Example A -A General Procedure for Examples 1-10<br>
[0016] The reaction flask was charged with 2000 g of silica slurry and 165 g of<br>
concentrated sulphuric acid. The slurry was heated to a temperature of 70 °C and the heat was<br>
then turned off. At this point, a mixture containing 9.10 g of methyltrichlorosilane and 16.38<br>
g of dimethyldichlorosilane was added directly to the reaction flask via a long-stem funnel in<br>
rapid fashion over a period of about 2-7 minutes. The treated slurry was then allowed to stir<br>
as it cooled to room temperature over a 60-minute period.<br>
[0017] To the stirred slurry was added 600 mL of a solution containing 25 percent by<br>
weight of sodium hydroxide, in order to adjust the pH in the range of 3.4 to 3.7. The<br>
neutralized slurry was transferred to the Buchner funnel and vacuum filtered to removed the<br>
aqueous phase. The filter cake was then washed repeatedly with copious amounts of water<br>
until the filtrate read less than 100 micro ohms. After allowing it to air-dry overnight, the<br>
filter cake was transferred to plastic pails with lids and spray dried as follows.<br>
[0018] The air-dried treated silica was re-slurried in deionized water to provide a slurry<br>
containing 20-40 percent by weight of the treated silica. The slurry was mixed until all of the<br>
solids were broken up. The slurry was then pumped to a Niro Atomizer spray drier at a rate of<br>
about 20 ml/minute with an inlet temperature of 260 °C and an outlet temperature of between<br>
120-140 °C. The dried and treated silica product was collected and stored in glass jars.<br><br>
[0019] An elemental analysis of the treated silica was conducted by an independent testing<br>
laboratory. The results of elemental analyses obtained for treated silica fillers prepared in<br>
Examples 1-10 are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0020] In Table 1, the following abbreviations and acronyms are used. MPTES represents<br>
3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane HS-CH2CH2CH2-Si(OCH3)3 and DMDCS represents<br>
dimethyldichlorosilane (CH3)2SiCl2- In the column entitled Trichlorosilanes,<br>
M is methyltrichlorosilane CH3SiCl3, P is n-propyltrichlorosilane C3H7SiCl3,<br>
Ph is phenyltrichlorosilane C6H5SiC3 and CN is 3-cycanopropyltrichlorosilane<br>
N═C-CH2CH2CH2-SiCl3.<br>
[0021] The new and unexpected results obtained according to the invention, i.e., the deposit<br>
of more siloxane, can be appreciated by comparing Examples 1 and 2, which show that the<br>
Percent Loss was decreased from 15 percent in Example 1 where only the dichlorosilane was<br>
used, to 4 percent in Example 2 where a blend of the dichlorosilane and a trichlorosilane were<br>
employed. As can be seen in Example 3, further improvements can be obtained by the<br>
addition of other silanes to the blend. Examples 4-7 show that the rate of addition is not a<br>
critical factor in improving the deposit of siloxanes on silica surfaces. Examples 8-10 show<br>
the results obtained when trichlorosilanes containing groups other than alkyl groups are<br>
employed.<br>
[0022] Thus, a comparison of Example 1 with Example 2 shows a clear improvement.<br>
Example 3 shows that the inclusion of other additives did not have a deleterious affect; in<br>
fact, the addition of other additives to the blend of dichlorosilanes and trichlorosilanes may<br>
actually be advantageous in many some instances. A comparison of Example 4 with Example<br>
5 shows the affect of adding a trichlorosilane, as does a comparison of Example 6 with<br>
Example 7. Also by comparing Example 6 with Examples 7-10, one can see a range of<br>
trichlorosilanes which can be used, and the fact that the presence of organofunctional<br>
moieties on trichlorosilanes did not affect performance to any great extent.<br>
[0023] Other variations may be made in compounds, compositions, and methods described<br>
herein without departing from the essential features of the invention. The embodiments of the<br>
invention specifically illustrated herein are exemplary only and not intended as limitations on<br>
their scope except as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
