embodiment, the impurity is a thioamide.<br>
n. The Decoy Agent<br>
Methods are provided for preventing or minimizing the formation of<br>
impurities such as thioamides. Desirably, the present invention provides methods for<br>
preventing or minimizing the formation of thioamide impurities during thionations of<br>
carbonyl compounds containing nitrile groups. The method utilizes a decoy agent<br>
containing a nitrile group. See, Scheme 2.<br><br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors have hypothesized that<br>
thioamide impurities are formed by addition of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a H2S by-<br>
product, or a dithiaphosphetane by-product such as a Lawesson's reagent by-product,<br>
among others, to a nitrile moiety. See, Scheme 3. Therefore, the inventors have<br>
found that the addition of a decoy agent in the reaction mixture that prevents or<br>
minimizes the formation of the thioamide impurity is advantageous.<br><br><br>
The decoy agent used in the present invention competes with the nitrile<br>
substituent of the carbonyl compound during thionation. In one embodiment, the<br>
decoy agent competes with the nitrile substituent for reaction with H2S, an H2S by-<br>
product formed during the reaction, or a Lawesson's agent by-product formed during<br>
thionation of a carbonyl compound having a nitrile compound attached thereto.<br>
However, the decoy agent desirably reacts only minimally or does not react with<br>
actual thionating reagent.<br>
The term "decoy agent" as used herein is distinguishable from "scavengers",<br>
"trapping agents" or "mopping reagents". As known to those of skill in the art,<br>
scavengers, trapping agents or mopping reagents are used to remove excess reagents,<br>
products, or other formed impurities. For example, H2S can be scavenged with lead<br>
acetate, trapped with molecular sieves, or mopped with water. A decoy agent,<br>
however, is intentionally added to redirect any side reactions and is a sacrificial<br>
reagent which protects the product from being a source of a contaminant<br>
One of skill in the art would readily be able to select a suitable decoy agent<br>
depending on the reaction conditions, cost of decoy agent, reactivity of the decoy<br>
agent, reactivity of the carbonyl compound, and reactivity of the carbonyl group of<br><br>
the carbonyl compound. Desirably, the decoy agent is similar in structure to the<br>
nitrile group of the carbonyl compound.<br>
Electron withdrawing substituents attached to the decoy agent can increase the<br>
reactivity of the decoy agent, and specifically, the reactivity of a nitrile group on the<br>
decoy agent. Desirably, the electron withdrawing substituent includes a halogen, and<br>
more desirably chlorine. Desirably, the decoy agent is chloroacetonitrile (ClCH2CN),<br>
trichloroacetonitrile, or 1,3-dicyanobenzene.<br>
In one embodiment, the carbonyl compound contains a very reactive carbonyl<br>
group and a less reactive nitrile group, whereby the carbonyl group easily reacts with<br>
the thionating compound. In this case, a less reactive decoy agent can be utilized<br>
during the thionation reaction to prevent formation of the thioamide impurity.<br>
However, more reactive decoy agents can be utilized with reactive carbonyl<br>
compounds. Typically, acetonitrile is utilized if the carbonyl group of the carbonyl<br>
compound easily reacts with the thionating agent<br>
In another embodiment, the carbonyl compound contains a reactive carbonyl<br>
group and a reactive nitrile group. In this case, a moderately reactive decoy agent can<br>
be utilized during the thionation reaction to prevent formation of the thioamide<br>
impurity. Typically, moderately reactive decoy agents such as benzonitrile, p-<br>
chlorobenzonitrile, p-methylbenzonitrile, 1,3-dicyanobenzene, 3- and 4-<br>
cyanopyridines and malononitrile can be utilized.<br>
In a further embodiment the carbon-containing compound contains a less<br>
reactive carbonyl group and a highly reactive nitrile. In this case, a highly reactive<br>
decoy agent can be utilized during the thionation reactive to prevent formation of the<br>
thioamide impurity. Typically, highly reactive decoy agents such as N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolecarbonitrile, 2-thiophenecarbonitrile, 2-cyanopyridine, chloroacetonitrile and<br>
trichloroacetonitrile can be utilized.<br>
Examples of decoy agents that can be used according to the present invention<br>
include, without limitation, aryl nitriles including benzonitrile, p-chlorobenzonitrile,<br>
p-ethoxybenzonitrile, p-methoxybenzonitrile, o-nitrobenzonitrile, p-<br>
acetylbenzonitrile, p-methylbenzonitrile, p-fluorobenzonitrile, and 1,3-<br>
dicyanobenzene; aliphatic nitriles such as acetonitrile (CH3CN), propionitrile,<br>
butyronitrile, iosbutyronitrile, chloroacetonitrile, trichloroacetonitrile and<br><br>
malononitrile; a nitrile compound having one or more electron withdrawing<br>
substituents; or heteroaryl nitriles including N-methyl-2-pyrrolecarbonitrile, 2-<br>
thiophenecarbonitrile, and 2-cyanopyridine. However, while some decoy agents may<br>
be utilized, it may be cost-prohibitive for the use thereof. For example, CH3CN is an<br>
inexpensive, low-boiling, common reagent with twice the moles of nitrile groups as<br>
compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolecarbonitrile. Further, while 2-thiophenecarbonitrile<br>
is twice as reactive as benzonitrile, it is considerably more expensive. More<br>
desirably, the decoy agent is similar in structure to N-methyl-2-pyrrolecarbonitrile<br>
and is acetonitrile or 2-thiophenecarbonitrile.<br>
A molar excess of the decoy agent is typically added to the reaction mixture,<br>
where the reaction mixture contains a compound having a nitrile moiety, i.e., moles of<br>
decoy agent are greater than moles of nitrile compound. However, less than a 1:1<br>
ratio of decoy agent to the compound having a nitrile moiety, i.e., moles of decoy<br>
agent are less than moles of nitrile compound, can also be utilized. In one<br>
embodiment, greater than an about 10 molar excess of decoy agent is utilized. In<br>
another embodiment, greater than an about 20 molar excess; in a further embodiment,<br>
greater than an about 40 molar excess; and in still another embodiment, greater than a<br>
100 molar excess of decoy agent is utilized. In one embodiment, the decoy agent can<br>
be utilized as the solvent. One of skill in the art would readily be able to determine<br>
the amount of decoy agent required depending on the reaction being performed,<br>
reagents utilized, and reactivity of the decoy agent<br>
HI. The Method of the Invention<br>
The present invention thereby provides methods for preventing or minimizing<br>
the formation of thioarnide impurities. Typically, the thioamide impurities formed<br>
according to the present invention include thioamide groups attached at any location<br>
on the backbone of the thioamide molecule.<br>

membered ring; or (iii) a 4 to 8 heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms<br>

Typically, the decoy agent utilized is in the presence of a solvent. One of skill<br>
in the art would readily be able to select a suitable solvent for use with the decoy<br>
agent depending on the other reagents utilized and reaction conditions, among others.<br>
Desirably, the solvent does not react with any of the reagents utilized in the reaction<br>
and does not contain any peroxides. In one embodiment, the solvent includes<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), toluene, and methylene<br>
chloride, among others.<br>
The decoy agent can be utilized at any temperature that facilitates the reaction<br>
and can readily be determined by one of skill in the art. Desirably, the decoy agent is<br>
utilized at least room temperature, and more desirably at the boiling point of the<br>
solvent.<br>
When the decoy agent is utilized in a thionation reaction, the reaction is<br>
performed using a thionating agent. Several thionating agents that replace O-atoms<br>
with S-atoms are known in the art and include, without limitation, phosphorus<br>
pentasulfide (P4S10), hydrogen sulfide, Lawesson's reagent, and<br>
dialkyldithiophosphates such as diethyldithiophosphate (See, Phosphorous and Sulfur<br>
1985,25,297). See, Scheme 4.<br><br><br>
Desirably, the thionating agent does not react with the decoy reagent. The<br>
thionation can also be performed with thionating by-products that agents are formed<br>
during the reaction and include:<br><br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preventing or<br>
minimizing the formation of thioamide impurities during thionation of a nitrile<br>
compound containing a carbonyl group including performing the thionation in the<br>
presence of a decoy agent having a nitrile group.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a product prepared by<br>
the method of the present invention.<br>
The resulting compounds of the present invention can be formulated in a<br>
physiologically compatible carrier and used as PR modulators as described in US<br>
Patent Nos. 6,509,334; 6,391,907; 6,417,214; and 6,407,101, which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. The invention further provides kits comprising the<br>
product.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention and do not<br>
limit the scope thereof. One skilled in the art will appreciate that although specific<br>
reagents and conditions are outlined in the following examples, modifications can be<br>
made which are meant to be encompassed by the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - REACTIVITY OF DECOY AGENTS<br>
One mmol of the aromatic nitrile decoy agents set forth in Table 1 were<br>
reacted at reflux with the thionating agent diethyl dithiophosphate (0.2 mL) in wet<br>
THF (6 mL) to give the respective thioamides.<br><br><br>
This example illustrates that 2-thiophenecarbonitrile was the most reactive<br>
with the thionating agent.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - USE OF DECOY AGENT DURING THIONATION<br>
Acetonitrile (21 kg, 512 mol) was utilized as decoy agent in a thionation of 5-<br>
(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-benzoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-<br>
carbonitrile (34 kg, 126 mol), i.e., a 4:1 molar ratio, using Lawesson's reagent (28.3<br>
kg, 70 mol) in DME (505 kg) at reflux to give 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-1,4-dihydro-<br>
benzoxazm-6-yl)-l-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile (26.7 kg; 74% yleld).<br>
The crude reaction mixture of 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-1,4-dihydro-<br>
benzoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbomtrile contained only about 2.6% of 5-<br>
(4,4^imethyl-2-tm^xo-1,4-dihydro-benzoxazine)-l-methyl-pyrrole-2-thioamide<br>
impurity. After recrystallization, the purified 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-1,4-dihydro-<br>
berizoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile was about 99.90% pure.<br>
When the reaction was performed in the absence of the decoy agent, the<br>
thioamide impurity was present at about 11 to about 12%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - COMPETITION BETWEEN 2-THIOPHENECARBONITRILE<br>
AND ALKYL NITRILES<br>
2-Thiophenecarbonitrile (1 rnmol) was reacted at reflux with diethyl<br>
dithiophosphate (200 ÂµL) in wet THF (6 mL) and in the presence of the aliphatic<br><br>
nitrites (1 mmol) set forth in Table 2. The conversion of the undesired thiophene-2-<br>
carbothioic acid amide was then measured.<br><br>
This example illustrates that conversion of a reactive nitrile, such as 2-<br>
thiophene carbonitrile, to the thioamide impurity is high when no decoy agent is<br>
utilized. However, conversion to the thioamide impurity is decreased when decoy<br>
agents are utilized.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - COMPETITION BETWEEN 2-THIOPHENECARBONITRILE<br>
AND ACETONITRILE<br>
2-Thiophenecarbonitrile (1 mmol) was reacted at reflux with diethyl<br>
dithiophosphate (200 ÂµL) in wet THF and acetonitrile using the molar equivalents set<br>
form in Table 3. The conversion of the undesired thiophene-2-carbothioic acid amide<br>
was then measured.<br><br><br>
This example illustrates that conversion to the thioamide impurity decreased<br>
as the amount of acetonitrile increased.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 - EFFECT OF ACETONITRILE ON THE FORMATION OF<br>
THIOAMIDE IMPURITIES<br>
The nitrile set forth in Table 4 was reacted at reflux with diethyl<br>
dithiophosphate (200 ÂµL) in wet THF (5 mL) and acetonitrile (1 mL = 20 molar<br>
equivalents). The control set contained 6 mL THF and no acetonitrile. After 5 hours<br>
at 66 oC, the mixtures were subjected to GC/MS analysis to detect the presence of<br>
thioamide impurity.<br><br>
This example illustrates that conversion to the thioamide impurity was<br>
suppressed in samples containing acetonitrile. Further, samples containing<br>
acetonitrile and p-methoxybenzonitrile had very little conversion to the thioamide<br>
impurity.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 - USE OF DECOY AGENT DURING THIONATION<br>
A 2-L flask was charged with 1,2-dimethoxyethane (2.1 L) and 5-<br>
(spiro[cyclohexane-1,3'-[3H]indole]-2'-oxo-5'-yl)-1H-pyrrole-l-methyl-2-<br>
carbonitrile (150 g, 0.49 mol), followed by Lawesson's reagent (119 g, 0.295 mol)<br>
and acetonitrile (0.3 L, 5.75 mol), i.e., a 12:1 molar ratio of decoy agent to nitrile<br>
compound. The suspension was heated to reflux and kept for 1 hour. Upon cooling to<br>
ambient temperature, water (2.51 L) was added to the suspension at a rate to maintain<br>
the temperature below 30 Â°C. The yellow-greenish precipitate was filtered on a fritted<br>
funnel. The solid was transferred back to the reaction flask and slurried in water (0.75<br><br>
L) overnight. The yellow suspension was filtered, washed with water (0.45 L) and<br>
dried to give 154 g (98% yleld, 99.0% purity by HPLC area, mp 269-271.5 Â°C, 0.60%<br>
thioamide impurity) of 5-(2 '-thioxospiro[cyclohexane-l ,3 '-[3H]indol]-5 '-yl)-l -<br>
methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 - USE OF DECOY AGENT DURING THIONATION (SCALE-UP)<br>
In this example, a larger scale production of [5-(2'-thioxospiro[cyclohexane-<br>
1,3 '-[3H]indol]-5'-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile] was performed.<br>
A 100-gal vessel was charged with 1,2-dimethoxyethane (155.1 kg, 178.8 L)<br>
and 5-(spiro[cyclohexane-1,3'-[3H]indole]-2'-oxo-5'-yl)-1H-pyrrole-1-methyl-2-<br>
carbonitrile (12.78 kg), followed by Lawesson's reagent (10.14 kg) and acetonitrile<br>
(20.1 kg, 25.6 L). The contents of the vessel was heated to reflux and kept for 1 hour.<br>
The orange-brown solution was cooled to 70 Â°C and a sample was withdrawn for the<br>
reaction completion test that showed less than 0.2% of the starting material. The batch<br>
was cooled to ambient temperature and water (213.9 kg) was charged at a rate to<br>
maintain temperature between 23 and 29 Â°C. The yellow-greenish suspension was<br>
filtered on a 0.3 SQM PSL filter/dryer. The solids were slurried in water (63.9 kg) on<br>
the filter/dryer for 15 minutes. The yellow suspension was transferred into a 100-gal<br>
vessel and the filter was rinsed with water (2 x 10 kg) into the vessel. The slurry was<br>
stirred at 1S-26 Â°C for 12 hours, filtered on a 0.3 SQM PSL filter/dryer and washed<br>
with water (2 x 19.2 kg). The solids were dried in a vacuum oven at initially 2O-30 Â°C<br>
and then at 45 Â°C to give 12.8 kg of crude 5-(2'-thioxospiro[cyclohexane-1,3'-<br>
[3H]indol]-5'-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile (95% yleld, 0.45% thioamide<br>
impurity).<br>
