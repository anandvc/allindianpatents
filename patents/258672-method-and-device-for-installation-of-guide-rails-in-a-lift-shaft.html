				<td>Method and device for installation of guide rails in a lift shaft<br>
The invention relates to a method as well as a device for installation of guide rails in a lift shaft, according to the introductory part of the independent patent claims.<br>
Guide rails are means for guidance of the lift cage or the counterweight within a lift shaft. The guide rails shall enable a controlled vertical movement through acceptance of horizontal forces. The lift cage or the counterweight is connected with the guide rails by wheels or slide parts which are fastened to, for example, the sides of the lift cage or the counterweight. Several lines of guide rails can also be present depending on the respective size and use of the lift. The counterweight can, since normally no horizontal forces occur, also be guided by guide rails in the form of an enclosure.<br>
The installation of guide rails in a lift shaft is, due to the length and weight of the individual elements, a time-intensive and difficult operation which is usually carried out in small teams. The transport of the individual guide rail elements within the lift shaft to an intended location usually takes place with the help of a mounting platform. In that case each element usually has to be brought from the ground floor to its intended location in the lift shaft.<br>
JP 05178561A discloses a method in which several guide rails can be drawn into the lift shaft in one working step. The individual guide rails are in that case connected together by way of couplings, which each consist of a joint, and pulled up in the lift shaft. Each coupling then bears the weight of the all guide rails and couplings hanging thereunder.<br>
The object of the present invention is to make available a device and a method for more efficient installation of guide rails in a lift shaft.<br>
According to the invention this object is fulfilled by the characterising features of the independent patent claims.<br>
The invention teaches a method and a device for installing guide rails in a lift shaft. In that case, several guide rails are each mechanically fastened by at least one coupling element to a common support means. The guide rails lined up one after the other at the common support means as a composite are conveyed by conveying means into the lift shaft.   In<br><br>
IP1577 English translation<br>
that case the guide rails hanging one after the other individually at the support means adopt a substantially vertical position during pulling up of the support means in the lift shaft.<br>
This has the advantage that a plurality of guide rails or all guide rails of a line can be drawn into the lift shaft in one working step. Through connection of the individual guide rails with the support means the guide rails can be pulled up in the lift shaft in one working step by one person with the help of the conveying means (for example a block and tackle and/or motor). It is also conceivable that the guide rails hanging at the support means are introduced into the lift shaft from above by a hoisting device independent of the lift shaft, such as, for example, a building crane. Costs for the mounting of the guide rails in a lift shaft can thereby be reduced.<br>
Advantageously the guide rails are fastened to the common support means prior to delivery. This has the advantage that the risk of mixing up the different types of guide rails at the installation location of the guide rails in the lift shaft is diminished. Through fixing the succession of individual guide rails in the lift shaft prior to delivery the guide rails can be supplied with elements such as, for example, sensors already pre-installed and/or integrated in the guide rails.<br>
According to another form of embodiment the guide rails can be fastened to the common support means also after delivery. The fastening can in that case be carried out in preparation in that the support means is connected by means of the coupling elements with the guide rails lying on a stack or the guide rails are fastened to the common support means during pulling up of the support means in the lift shaft. This has the advantage that the guide rails can be handled individually. The assembly personnel can in that case decide on site how many guide rail elements are to be drawn into the lift shaft in one working step and in which sequence.<br>
Advantageously the guide rails are drawn into the lift shaft by conveying means. Preferably conveying means (motor, deflecting roller, block-and-tackle) fastened to the shaft ceiling are used for this purpose. This has the advantage that the guide rails at the common support means can be drawn into the lift shaft by one person with little expenditure of force. As mentioned, external conveying means (for example, a building crane) can also be used.<br><br>
IP1577 English translation<br>
Advantageously, mounting of the guide rails in the lower region of the lift shaft is begun. After installation of the first guide rails a mounting platform (for example, the lift cage or a part of the same) can be introduced into the lift shaft and displaced upwardly so that further guide rails of the composite can be mounted. This has the advantage that a mounting platform serving for installation of the guide rails can be moved from below in upward direction along the already mounted guide rails. In that case the guide rails hanging in a vertical position one after the other individually at the support means are fastened in succession. Due to the fact that the guide rails following the mounting step already hang at their approximate position an efficient operation is made possible. The mounting platform is preferably equipped with necessary safety devices which, for example, limit the travel speed of the mounting platform, prevent crashing down of the same or in the case of need can also be used for arresting the mounting platform.<br>
Advantageously at least a part of the guide rails to be used - for example all guide rails of a mounting section - are suspended with the help of the support means in the lift shaft before mounting of the guide rails at the shaft wall is commenced. This has the advantage that individual guide rail elements do not have to be picked up each time at a storage location, for example at the ground floor. A mounting section can contain all guide rails of a line or it can contain a part of the guide rails of a line. In addition, it is possible to mount more than one mounting section of the lift cage or more than one mounting section of the counterweight at the shaft wall in one working step.<br>
Advantageously the coupling elements and the support means are removed after mounting of the guide rails on the shaft wall. This has the advantage that the coupling elements and the support means can be used several times.<br>
Advantageously the device for installation of the guide rails in the lift shaft comprises means enabling installation of guide rails for the lift cage and/or guide rails for the counterweight. This has the advantage that not only the guide rails for the lift cage, but also the guide rails for the counterweight can be efficiently mounted in the lift shaft. Working steps which are similar in each instance can then be routinely executed with identical tools.<br>
A form of embodiment of the support means in which the coupling elements are already<br><br>
IP1577 English translation<br>
premounted on the guide means at a suitable spacing is particularly preferred. This has the advantage that the guide rails only still have to be connected with the support means by means of the coupling elements, which takes place quickly and is simple.<br>
Advantageously the support means is a cable or a chain, the length of which amounts to a multiple of a guide rail. This has the advantage that several guide rails can be drawn into the lift shaft in one working step at the non-rigid support means. Due to the fact that the length of the support means is a multiple of the guide rails several guide rails can be drawn into the lift shaft as a unit and in succession in one working step.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the following by reference to examples of embodiment and according to Figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	shows a schematic view of a first example of embodiment of a lift shaft with<br>
guide rails,<br>
Fig. 2	shows a schematic view of a first example of embodiment of a coupling of a<br>
guide rail to a support means,<br>
Fig. 3	shows a schematic view of a second example of embodiment of a coupling<br>
of a guide rail to a support means and<br>
Fig. 4	shows a schematic view of a further example of embodiment of a coupling<br>
element for a premounted guide rail component to a support means.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an arbitrary lift shaft 1 which is arranged in or at an arbitrary building or shell and is provided for at least one lift. The shaft can be any desired known lift shaft 1 provided for vertical transport of passengers or goods between storeys 2 of the building. The lift shaft 1 can be separated from the storeys 2 by doors.<br>
The guide rails 10 make it possible to hold the lift cage (not shown) in the region of a predetermined horizontal sectional area of the lift shaft 1. The wheels or slide parts, which are fastened to the outer side of the lift cage, roll or slide along the guide rails 10. Forces with horizontal force vectors arise due to the usually asymmetrical loading of the lift cage. These forces are transmitted by the wheels or the slide parts to the guide rails 10.  The<br><br>
IP1577 English translation<br>
guide rails 10 typically consist of individual elements which are approximately of 2.5 to 5 metres length and which are lined up to form lines. Several lines for guidance of the lift in a shaft 1 can also be present depending on the respective size, weight and use of the lift.<br>
A counterweight which similarly moves up and down in the lift shaft 1 is usually guided by guide rails 10 similarly by means of wheels or slide parts. Since in the case of the counterweight no large asymmetrical loads arise, guide rails 10 are known which merely enclose the counterweight as a boundary frame and thereby prevent larger horizontal movements of the counterweight.<br>
In order to draw the individual elements of the guide rails 10 into the lift shaft 1 use is made, according to the invention, of a common support means 13. The common support means 13 is drawn into the lift shaft 1 by conveying means 11 (for example, a deflecting roller, a block-and-tackle or a motor, or a suitable combination of these components), which advantageously are fastened to a shaft ceiling 12. It is also conceivable for the guide rails 10 hanging at the support means 13 to be introduced into the lift shaft 1 by a lifting device, such as, for example, a building crane, arranged at a distance from the lift shaft 1.<br>
Depending on the respective conveying means 11 used for drawing in the support means 13 the support means 13 should amount to a multiple of the length L of the lift shaft 1. Thus, for example, in the case of use of a deflecting roller 11 as conveying means the support means 13 should have at least three times the length L of the lift shaft 1. Twice the lift shaft length L is needed in order to be able to install the support means 13 unloaded. At a third of the lift shaft length L of the support means 13 the guide rails 10 are mounted.<br>
The support means 13 itself can be realised in various forms. Thus, for example, it can be a rope, cable, chain or belt. In addition, a variety of materials are conceivable for the material from which the support means 13 is made. For example, the support means 13 can comprise iron, steel, plastics material or natural fibres. It can also be a combination of different materials.<br>
Different forms of embodiment are possible for the coupling elements 14 according to the invention.   The coupling elements 14 in that case have to be designed so that they can<br><br>
IP 1577 English translation<br>
reliably connect and bear the weight of a guide rail 10 with the support means 13. It is then to be observed that separation of the connection and thus removal of the coupling element 14 from the guide rail 10 should be possible with the smallest amount of effort after mounting of the guide rails 10 in the lift shaft 1. Advantageously, such a coupling element 14 can also be reusable.<br>
The support means 13 is preferably supplied with premounted coupling elements 14. The coupling elements 14 can be fixedly mounted on the support means 13 or be demountable.<br>
The term "assembly personnel" is used in the present context to describe persons who mount a lift installation in the lift shaft 1 and/or prepare it for mounting in the lift shaft 1. The lift installation is assembled from the supplied means. In that case the guide rails 10 are mounted in the lift shaft 1, the lift cage installed, connections for operation of the lift undertaken, etc. The assembly personnel can be composed of expert workers and/or auxiliary persons.<br>
The mounting platform is preferably the lift cage itself or parts of the lift cage which at the time of installation of the guide rails 10 are already present in the lift shaft 1 or installed towards this time. However, it can also comprise means which are partly or completely demounted prior to later installation of the actual lift. The mounting platform is movable in the lift shaft. Mounting of lift elements in the shaft 1 is simplified for the assembly personnel by the mounting platform. Elements of the lift installation, tools and assembly personnel can be conveyed up and down in the lift shaft on the mounting platform. The assembly personnel can then execute mounting procedures at an advantageous working height.<br>
Mounting of the guide rails 10 takes place at their intended location. Depending on the respective kind of guide rails 10 not only the line, but also the position within the line for an individual element is predetermined for the individual elements. Through the lining up of the guide rails 10 at the support means 13 the association of the guide rails 10 can be established in more agreeable working conditions than in a confined and dark lift shaft 1. The risk of confusion of the different types of guide rails 10 and the risk of individual guide elements being mounted at an incorrect intended location are thus reduced.<br><br>
IP 1577 English translation<br>
The means required for mounting of a lift are introduced into the lift shaft 1 from at least one storage location 3. A storage location 3 is preferably disposed at the ground floor of the lift shaft 1, because the means required for the lift can usually be delivered particularly easily to the ground floor. However, it is also conceivable for further storage locations 3 to be added at higher or lower storeys 2.<br>
A composite with several guide rails 10 is shown in Fig. 2. Each of the guide rails 10 is fastened to the support means 13 by an own coupling element 14. In the illustrated example four guide rails 10 are suspended one after the other vertically at the support means 13 in the lift shaft.<br>
The coupling elements 14 can, as shown in Fig. 2, be fastened to the support means 13 by a clamping or screw element 14.1. The coupling element 14 comprises a run 14.2 which is fastened to the clamping or screw element 14.1 and extends parallel to the support means 13. Provided at a lower end of the run 14.2 is a safety hook 14.3 which engages through a passage opening at the guide rail 10 and thus connects the guide rail 10 with the support means 13. In order to prevent slipping of the guide rail 10 from the safety hook 14.3 this can be equipped with, for example, a resiliency mounted lug 14.4 which in the manner of a barb prevents slipping out of the passage opening. The passage opening is preferably disposed at a place of the guide rail 10 which does not obstruct running along of the wheels or the slide parts of the lift cage or the counterweight. Advantageously, passage openings of the guide rails 10 used for joining together guide rails are employed. This has the advantage that no further passage openings have to be formed and thus commercially available guide rails can be used.<br>
The support means 13 is preferably a solid steel cable. A galvanised form of embodiment of the support means 13 is particularly preferred.<br>
An eye 15 or the like can be provided at the upper end of the support means 13 in order to be able to connect the support means with the conveying means 11.<br>
The spacing A between two guide rails 10 hanging in succession at the support means preferably amounts to between 5 millimetres and 100 millimetres. Damage of the guide rail ends is thereby precluded, since they do not hit against one another.<br><br>
IP1577 English translation<br>
A length of the run 14.2 between 200 millimetres and 1000 millimetres has proved appropriate in order to impart to the coupling element according to Fig. 2 the requisite flexibility to enable problem-free drawing into the shaft.<br>
A further form of embodiment of a coupling element 14 is shown in Fig. 3. The upper end of a guide rail 10 can be recognised in Fig. 3. A passage opening is provided at one limb of the guide rail 10. A pin 14.1, on which a cylindrical means 14.2 for fixing the support means 13 is provided, is inserted through this passage opening. The means 14.2 for fixing the support means comprise a screw 14.3. The support means 13 is clamped in place by tightening the screw 14.3 and the coupling 14 can no longer slip along the support means 13. The pin 14.1 is, as mentioned, inserted by one end through the passage opening and can be secured by a split pin 14.4 or a similar securing element.<br>
A further form of embodiment of the invention is indicated in Fig. 4. A schematic view of a further example of embodiment of a coupling element 14 is shown. In the illustrated example of embodiment two guide rails 10 form a premounted guide rail component (this guide rail component is, for the sake of simplicity, also termed guide rail). The two guide rails 10 can be connected together by, for example, one or more transverse elements 10.1. The transverse element 10.1 can, for example, be directly used for fastening the guide rails 10 to a shaft wall. The coupling element 14 in this case engages centrally at the transverse element 10.1. For this purpose the transverse element 10.1 has a slot through which a part of the coupling element 14 projects. The coupling element 14 can, similarly to that shown in Fig. 2, comprise a securing element 14.4 in order to prevent slipping down of the guide rails. The guide rail or the guide rail component as well as further guide rails following thereon then hang in the lift shaft substantially vertically at the common support means 13.<br>
Advantageous combinations are possible; thus, for example, a part region of the guide rails, for example a first or the lowermost guide rail 10 of a line, can be mounted in known conventional manner and the remaining rails can be drawn into the shaft by means of the common support means 13. This has the advantage that a mounting platform where applicable can be mounted directly after mounting of the lowermost guide rails.</td>
