				<td>This invention relates to novel lipophilic ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the said compounds. The compounds of the present invention are useful as antimalarials.<br>
This invention generally relates to a process for the preparation of lipophilic ethers of dihydroartemisinin 2 of general formula 6 as a new series of antimalarials which are active by both i.m. and oral routes. More particularly the present invention relates to new ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin of general formula 6 wherein R represent groups such as 2-Biphenylmethyl,4-Biphenylmethyl, 4-Biphenylethyl, 2-(biphenyl-2-yloxy) ethyl, 2-(biphenyl-4-yloxy) ethyl, 1 -Adamantanemethyl, 2-Adamantanyl, 2-adamantan-l-yl-ethyl, 2-adamantan-2-yl-ethyl, 2-(9H-fluoren-9-yl) - ethyl, (9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methyl and the like. Some of these compounds are several times more potent than the current artemisinin-based antimalarials such as artemether 3 and arteether 4. Dihydroartemisinin is available from reduction of artemisinin 1, a natural product antimalarial from Artemisia annua. [For background literature on artemisinin and its derivatives see: (a) Klayman, D. L Science 1985, 228, 1049. (b) Bhattacharya, A. K.; Sharma, R. P. Heterocycles 1999, 51, 1651. (c) Borstnik, K.; Paik, I.; Shapiro, T. A.; Posner, G. H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002, 32, 1661. (d) Ploypradith, P. Acta Trop. 2004, 89, 329. (e) O'Neill, P. M.; Posner, G. H. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2945.]<br>
The main objective of this invention is to provide novel lipophilic ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin which are more potent antimalarials than the clinically useful ether derivatives of the dihydroartemisinin such as artemether and arteether.<br>
These compounds have been tested against multi-drug resistant Plasmodium yoelii in mice and have been found several times more active than artemether and arteether by oral route. Thus, the invention relates to pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel lipophilic ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin having the following formula 6<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein, R is a biphenyl or adamantly group selected form 2-Biphenylmethyl, 4-Biphenylmethyl, 4-Biphenylethyl, 2-(biphenyl-2-yloxy) ethyl, 2-(biphenyl-4-yloxy) ethyl, 1-Adamantanemethyl, 2-Adamantanyl, 2-adamantan-l-yl-ethyl, 2-adamantan-2-yl-ethyl, 2-(9H-fluoren-9-yl) - ethyl, (9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methyl represented by the chemical formula 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, 6g, 6h, 6i, 6j and 6k given here as under:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of novel lipophilic ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin, wherein the process comprises:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with lipophilic alcohols of general formula 5 represented as R-OH, wherein R represents 2-Biphenylmethyl,4-Biphenylmethyl, 4-Biphenylethyl, 2-(biphenyl-2-yloxy) ethyl, 2-(biphenyl-4-yloxy) ethyl, 1-Adamantanemethyl, 2-Adamantanyl, 2-adamantan-l-yl-ethyl, 2-adamantan-2-yl-ethyl, 2-(9H-fluoren-9-yl) - ethyl, (9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methyl under acidic conditions at a temperature ranging from -10°C to 27°C in the presence of an acidic catalyst and organic solvent such as herein described;<br>
b]	neutralization of the product obtained from step [a] with an organic solvent;<br>
c]	washing the product obtained from step [b];<br>
d]	drying the washed product of step [c] by conventional methods;<br>
e]	purifying the product obtained from step [d] to obtain the compound of formula 6.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the reaction of dihydroartemisinin of formula 2 with lipophilic alcohols of general formula 5 may be effected under acidic conditions using acidic catalysts such as BF3.OEt2, p-toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA), coned HCl, coned H2SO4, cation exchanger such as Amberlyst-15 and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the organic solvent used may be chosen such as CH2CI2, C6H6,CHCl3,THF etc.<br>
Purification of compounds of general formula 6 wherein R has the same meaning as above, may be carried out by column chromatography using combination of organic solvents as eluants. The products which are mixtures of a and  (3  isomers can be further  separated by column<br><br>
chromatography to give pure a- isomers of general formula 7 and ß- isomers of general formula 8 wherein R has the same meaning as above.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

Random bred Swiss mice of either sex (20 ± 2 g) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1x105 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatments with test compounds were administered to group of 6 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 12-48 mg/kg/day. The compounds were administered as solutions in oil via oral route for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3). P-Arteether and a-Arteether was used as positive control.<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular interval till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated. The compounds which showed more than 90%suppression were identified for further screening.<br>
For determing the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28.The dose at which no parasitaemia develops during the observation period has been recorded as the curative dose. The results are shown in table 3.<br>
