				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of heparin bonded olefin polymers<br>
and the olefin polymers prepared thereby.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heparin is a naturaity occurring mucopolysaccharide composed of repeating units of<br>
disaccharides. The principal anticoagulant effect of heparin is due to its ability to<br>
accelerate the inhibition of thrombin factor Xa by AT HL The effect of heparin on fibrin<br>
clot formation extends beyond its direct effect of neutralisation of thrombin and Xa In the<br>
absence of heparin or other anticoagulants fibrinogen rapidly coats foreign surfaces and<br>
platelets adhere to fibrinogen soon thereafter. Systemic administration of heparin even in<br>
enormous doses used for CPB, incompletely prevents adherence of fibrinogen and platelets<br>
to synthetic surfaces. Blood coagulation remains active during CPB despite profound<br>
anticoagulation with heparin. Protamine activates complement, causes vasodilation and can<br>
cause life-threatening anaphylaxis or pulmonary hyper tension<br>
In order to reduce the drawbacks of heparinization of blood, attempts were made for the<br>
immobilization   of  heparin   on   to   devices   for   blood   contacting   applications.<br>
Cardiopulmonary applications like membrane oxygenator, catheters, etc. are a few to<br>
mention among them The effect of protein adsorption of the anticoagulant activity of<br>
surface immobilised heparin on to carboxyiated polystyrene beads was determined by<br>
Vandelden et al (X Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed 7,8; 727-740, 1996) and was found<br>
promising.<br>
Different methods of immobilisation of heparin had been attempted. Heparin being a<br>
complex macro molecular organic polysaccharides with high negative charges can bind to<br>
positively charged matrices. Such ionic binding has been materialised by Eberle, Manton<br>
&amp; Meals (J. Biomed Mater. Res.7:145-153,1973), with quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
which in turn is bound to synthetic surfaces like polyethylene and poly vinyl chloride. But<br>
stability of such ionically linked heparin is poor when compared to covalently bound<br>
heparin. Other methods of coating include that with the carbodiimide method<br>
Polyvinyl  Chloride Heparin has earlier been bound or immobilised with (pVA)to a hydrogel. Other matrices<br>
which had been tried to be coated with heparin include ^MMA.) Ajrart from mis, biological<br>
substrates like collagen have been immobilised with heparin<br>
Poly propylene had been coated with heparin by the Duraflo II (Universal coating) and the<br>
platelet adhesion of the coated sample has been studied It has been found that they have<br>
better blood compatibility, lesser blood material interaction and micro embolisation<br>
prevention capabilities. For universal coating, the physio chemical properties of the<br><br>
unfractionated heparin are modified with a proprietary binding agent The resulting<br>
material Duraflo II heparin has high affinity to a variety of synthetic surfaces. They retain<br>
all anti-coagulation properties of heparin.<br>
Different synthetic materials have been used for the fabrication of devices  like<br>
Polyvinyl Chloridi polycarbonate (for oxygenator shell), polypropylene (for membrane oxygenator) 
blood bags), polyethylene (for catheters) and so on.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose heparin bonded polyolefin which does<br>
not affect the mechanical properties of me polyolefin.<br>
It is a further object of mis invention to propose heparin bonded polyolefin which retains<br>
the surface profile of the polymer after modification.<br>
Another object of mis invention is to propose heparin bonded potyolefin which is stable.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the preparation of heparin<br>
bonded polyolefin comprising the steps of cleaning the polyolefin in an organic solvent and<br>
drying, followed by treatment with an oxidizing agent such as an inorganic salt alone or in<br>
combination with an acid, and washing the treated sample, introducing the washed treated<br>
sample into a diimide solution followed by washing, treatment with a heparin solution,<br>
further washing and drying to obtain the heparin bonded polyolefin.<br>
According to mis invention is further provided heparin bonded olefin polymers.<br>
In accordance with this invention, Polyethylene (PE) sheets of commercial grade or high<br>
quality or polypropylene sheets or hollow fibres are cleaned with an organic solvent like<br>
Chloroform (CHCI3) Dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), dichloromethane (CH2CI2) or dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide (DMSO) or inorganic reagents like hydrogen peroxide nitric acid. The cleaned<br>
polymer is dried at 50-130°C for a period of one hour. They are then treated with an<br>
oxidising agent of inorganic origin. The inorganic salts that may be used for the purpose are<br>
Sodium Nitrate, Sodium Chromate, Potassium permanganate, Sodium peroxide either alone<br>
or in combination with other acids such as Nitric acid, Hydrochloric acid or Sulphuric<br>
acid of suitable strength.<br>
Polyethylene sheets of lxl cm size are cut from large sheets or polypropylene hollow<br>
fibres of about 275 microns are cut into strips of about 1 cm in length with a fine scalpel.<br>
They are washed with water, dried and introduced into a solution containing about 50-<br>
100% nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid alone or in combination with about<br>
1-10% by weight of sodium nitrate or potassium dichromate, potassium permanganate, etc..<br>
The treated samples are washed in distilled water. They are introduced into a 5-250 mg%<br><br><br><br>
0.0005gm of the dye was dissolved in .001% wt/wt of HCl containing .002% by wt Of<br>
NaCI. 0.0.243gm of the modified hollow fibre sample was put into 5ml of the dye solution.<br>
After 30 mins., the samples were taken out A control was done using unmodified<br>
polypropylene hollow fibers.<br>
On visual examination, a violet colouration was observed on the modified samples which<br>
was absent in the unmodified samples. This was due to the attachment of the dye molecules<br>
on to the heparin molecules. The absorbance of the remaining dye solution was monitored<br>
using a double beam Shimadsu Spectrophotometer at 63 Iran wave length. From a standard<br>
curve prepared from known amounts of the dye, the absorbance of the remaining solution<br>
from each sample was found out<br>
Absorbance of the following samples were measured<br>
1.	Reagent blank- "B* (The dye solution used for the dye depletion study)<br>
2.	Three control samples "01,02,03" (unmodified control samples of almost equal<br>
weight)<br>
3.	Three modified samples "M1,M2,M3" (heparin bonded samples of almost equal<br>
weight)<br><br>
Load at break<br>
The load at break of the modified polypropylene was compared with that of the unmodified sample in a tensile strength testing machine.<br>
A single strand of the hollow fibre was cut to a length of about 5cm. It was gripped to the jaws of the testing machine (Instron, Model 1011). The grip speed was set to 200 mm/mia lit was found that the average load at break was 1.71875.Newtons for the unmodified and 1.70S8 Newtons for the modified samples. It was found that there was no remarkable change in the mechanical properties either.<br><br><br>
Hence, it can be understood that the surface properties and mechanical properties are not affected by the modification.<br><br><br>
