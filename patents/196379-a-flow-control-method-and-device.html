This invention relates to a flow control method and device and to a container provided therewith. It is particularly concerned with such a method and device for use with a liquid container such as a bottle.<br>
In the case of a bottle or other container for a branded liquid product, such as an alcoholic beverage, once the original product has been emptied from the bottle it is known to refill the bottle with a counterfeit beverage and then display the refilled bottle with its original product labels in place but now containing the counterfeit beverage. In locations, where a branded beverage is dispensed as an individual drink rather than by the bottle, such as bars and restaurants, it is known that substantial losses are sustained by manufacturers of branded products by such counterfeiting. A similar problem can arise with other liquids such as oils, Where such counterfeiting occurs, for example, with an engine lubricating oil then use of the counterfeit product under the mistaken impression that it is a genuine one can result in damage to an engine with possible safety hazards.<br>
A number of proposals have been made in the past to make it difficult for a person seeking to counterfeit beverages in this way. UK Patent 694389 (Favre) shows a liquid dispensing closure for the neck of a vessel comprising a stopper arranged to be held against or in the neck of the vessel by a capsule fitting tightly around both the stopper and a part of reduced diameter on the neck, a pair of independent passages of substantially uniform cross section in the material of the stopper, each passage terminating on the bottom of the stopper in independent free communication with the interior of the vessel and near the lop of the stopper in independent free access to the outside by way of a common orifice in the side of the capsule, the arrangement being such that when tiie neck of the vessel is lower than the bottom, one of the passages is<br><br>
in the form of a normal syphon with a priming part reaching from the interior of the vessel to the end of the shorter leg of the syphon while the other passage includes in series from the mterior of the vessel an orifice of smaller cross section than the remainder of the passage and an inverted syphon that is, a syphon having the second property hereinbefore described.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a flow control method allowmg for ready flow of liquid out of a container while inhibitmg flow of liquid back into the container having two paths in an outlet from the contamer: the first path passing from the interior of the container to the outside thereof the first path having a first cross section and a first length; the second path passing from the exterior of the container to the inside thereof the second path having a second cross section and a second length; characterised in that the cumulative effect of the relationship between the first cross section (D) and first length (L) of the first path , and the second cross section (d) and second length (1) of the second path is such as to provide on the one hand relatively low impedance to flow of liquid out of the container by way of the first path with a consequential entry of air into the container by way of the second path; and on the other hand relatively high impedance to flow of liquid into the container by way of the first path with consequential displacement of air out of the container by way of the second path.<br>
Typically the first path (15) incorporates at least one change in direction (15A} in passing from the interior of the container (30) to the outside of the container so as to resist the msertion into the container of a liquid supply duct by way of the first path (15).<br><br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a flow control device comprising a body member for mounting the device in a container the body member defining thereon a first location and a second location; a first duct extending through the body member fr^om the first location to the second location, the first duct having a first cross section and a first length; a second air duct extending through the body member fi-om the second location to the first location, the second duct having a second cross section and a second length; characterised in that the cumulative effect of the relationship between the fu-st cross section (D) and first length (L) of the first duct, and the second cross section (d) and second length (1) of the second duct being such as to offer: relatively low impedance to flow of liquid along the first duct fi-om the first location to the second location and a consequent flow of air along the second duct fi-om the second location to the first location; and relatively high impedance to flow of liquid along the first duct from the second location to the first location with a consequent flow of air along the second duct from the first location to the second location.<br>
According to a first preferred version of the second aspect of the present invention the flow conO-ol device is characterized in that first duct (15) mcorporates at least one change in direction (15A) in passing fi-om the first location to the second location so as to resist the insertion into the first duct (15) ofa temporary liquid supply duct.<br>
According to a second preferred version of the second aspect of tiie present invention diere is provided a flow control device characterized by a body member (17) having a longitudinal axis (A) and being provided with a barrier (18, 19, 20) extending across the axis (A) to define a first location on one side of the barrier (18, 19, 20) and the second location on the other side of the barrier; the first duct (22) extending through<br><br>
the barrier (18, 19, 20) and being provided with a flow inlet (24) at the first location and a flow inlet (25) at the second location; tiie second duct (23) is provided with an air inlet (27) at the second location and an air outlet (28) at the first location; the air outlet (2S) and the flow outlet (25) lying on the axis (A); the air outlet (28) extending further into the first location from the barrier (18, 19, 20) than the flow inlet (24); the flow outlet (25) extending further into the second location from the barrier (18, 19, 20) tlian the air inlet (27). Typically the device is characterized by the barrier (18, 19, 20) being in the form of a cup shaped component having a base region (18), wall (19) extending from the base region (18) to provide an internal volume and an open top (20); a major proportion of the first duct (22) extending through the internal volume.<br>
Accordmg to a further embodhnent of the second preferred version of the second aspect of the present mvention the body member (17) includes an external sleeve (18) comprising one or more deformable members (18A to 19G) located about the axis (A) and adapted to resiiiently conform to a port into or out of a contamer (11) so as to inhibit the passage of liquid or air into or out of the container (11) by way of the port except through their respective first or second ducts (22, 23). Typically the or each deformable member (ISA to 18G) comprises an annular ring.<br>
A flow control member according to the second preferred version of the second aspect of the present invention or the further embodiment thereof the body member (17) or the barrier (18, 19) serves to locate abaffle (30) in a flow path from the first location to the vicmity of the flow inlet (24) so that liquid m the first location downstream of the baffle (30) is caused to be deflected so as not to enter the flow inlet (24) directly from flie flow path but firstty to dissipate kinetic energy by interaction with the baffle (30).<br><br>

Exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing of devices for closing a container according to the present invention of which:<br>

Figure 2 is an end view of Figure I in direction of arrow II; and<br>
Figure 3 is a part sectioned elevation of a bottle incorporating the device of Figures 1<br>
and 2;<br>
Figure 4 is a side sectional elevation of a second embodiment; and<br>
Figure 5 is a front sectional elevation at right angles to that of Figure 4,<br><br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Figures 1 to 3<br>
Plug 11 is of transparent plastics material with a degree of flexibility and has an inner end 12 and an outer end 13. Cylindrical wall 14 provides for the secure location of the device 11 in the neck of a bottle as shown in Figure 3.<br>
The plug 11 has extending through it a first duct 15 for liquid and a second duct 16 for air.<br>
First duct 15 is of circular cross section with diameter D and is of length L. The first duct 15 incorporates a change in direction provided by angularity 15A which serve to inhibit attempt to pass a flexible tube through the plug 11.<br>
Second duct 16 is of circular cross section with diameter d and length 1. Diameter d of second duct 16 is substantially less than diameter D of first duct 15. Length 1 of the second duct 16 is longer than length L of first duct 15 since it passes through the main body of plug 11 but also through stub extension 17 integral with plug 11.<br>
Figure 3 shows a bottle 30 with neck 31 in which is incorporated plug 11 as described in connection with Figures 1 and 2. The bottle 30 contains a liquid beverage 31. To obtain a supply of beverage 31 the bottle is tipped to enable the liquid to flow along neck 31. The liquid enters the plug 11, passes through it by way of first duct 15 and leaves the bottle. The change in liquid volume of beverage 31 in the bottle 30 causes a consequent fall in pressure in the interior of the bottle 30 which is compensated for by an inflow of air into the bottle 30 by way of second duct 16.<br><br>
The relative sizes of the first duct 15 and the second duct 16 provide for the combination of the two to act as a form of diode to liquid flow. In pouring out liquid 31 from the bottle the combination of the two ducts provides little impedance to flow. It is a widespread illegal practice to attempt to refill a bottle when it has been emptied-;; to a greater or lesser extent of an original authorised content so as to attempt to pass off ttie refilled liquid as being ttie same as an original contents. This is particularly widely practised when the original contents of the bottle was an imported expensive spirit such as whisky, gin or brandy and the bottle continues to bear its original label and/or other indicia. One common method of undertaking this form of counterfeiting is to immeise a conventional bottle in a reservoir of unoriginal liquid to enable the bottle to swiftly be refilled and thereafter the bottle is re-used.<br>
By using a bottle equipped with the device of the present invention the diode effect referred to earlier acts to resist the refilling of the bottle. Typically if the bottle is immersed in liquid the relative proportions of the first duct 15 and the second duct 16 act to resist liquid flow through the plug 11 from the outer end 13 to the inner end 12 to a greater extent than was the case with flow in the other direction. It appears that any transfer of liquid into the bottle is initially very slow and soon ceases.<br>
If an attempt is made to insert a tube through the first duct 15 then the discontinuity 15A acts to limit travel or causes the tube to so distort that it cannot readily allow liquid to be entered into the bottle by way of the tube.<br>
In use the plug 11 will be installed in a bottle in the bottling plant serving to fill the bottles. Once inserted the plug 11 is not readily withdrawn.<br><br>
Figures 4 and 5<br>
Part of a bottle 11 containing an alcoholic beverage is shown with a neck 12 shrouded once the bottle 11 has been filled by means of a capsule 13. Normally open end 14 of bore 15 of the neck 12 is shown closed by a flow control device 16. Inspection of a number of current bottle designs suggests that in manufacture bottles external dimensions are held to conform to relatively tight tolerances whilst internal dimensions, typically those of bore 15, are not held to the same tightness of tolerances nor is the bore of regular cylindrical form.<br>
The device 16 is made up of body member 17 with a central longitudmal axis A. The body member 17 incorporates a barrier in the form of a cup with a base B, frusto conical side wall W and an top perimeter T which forms a lip section to facilitate the pouring a controlled stream of beverage from the bottle 11 especially when die bottle is only part filled.<br>
The body member 17 is of relatively.rigid plastics material is provided with a sleeve 18 of relatively soft plastics material and incorporates a sequence of integral annular rings ISA to 18G with tiered outer faces (typically outer face 19 of ring 18A) so that the device 16 can be driven into the bore 15 and jammed therein in the axial location shown. The use of a sequence of rings ISA to 18G of flexible plastics material enables the device 16 to be introduced into and then forced down into bore 15 in a readily adapted filling operation. The rings 18A to 18F provide for the device once inserted in the bore to be accommodated in the neck with a bore 15 having a profile varying substantially from cylindrical and witiiout tight tolerancing of the bore being needed. Once inserted the device 16 cannot be removed with virtually destroying it.<br>
The device 16 is provided with a first, liquid, duct 22 and a second, air, duct 23.<br><br>
The first duct 22 extends from flow inlet end 24 within flie bottle 11 through the base B of the barrier and up to plane P shared by top perimeter T where the first duct 22 opens to atmosphere by way of flow outlet 25 lying symmetrically transverse axis A.<br>
The second duct 23 extends from air inlet end 27 outside the bottle 11 downwardly through the base 18 of the barrier and opens into the bottle 11 by way of air outlet 28 which lies symmetrically transversely across axis A.<br>
The first duct 22 and the second 23 lie at an angle to axis A to provide for the liquid flow outlet 25 to lie co-axial with, though off-set from, air outlet 28. This has been found to provide for greater control of pouring liquid from the bottle 11.<br>
The first duct 22, second duct 23 and body member 17 are formed as an integral unit to facilitate manufacture. Amongst other features the relative dimensions and locations of the ducts 22, 23 provide for controlled flow of liquid from the bottle through the &amp;st duct 22 and a flow of air into the bottle to replace the displaced liquid.<br>
A further liquid flow control feature is provided by a baffle 30 located beneath the device 16 when located in the bore 15 as shown. The baffle 30 has lower face 31 directed towards the interior of bottle 11; and upper face 32 directed towards the flow inlet end 24 of the first duct 22. The baffle 30 has outer edge 33 which provides foi ^ln armular flow passage between the baffle and the inner wall of the bottle in the vicinity of the device 16. The second duct 23 extends downwardly beneath the baffle 30 so that the baffle 30 is located between air outlet 28 and liquid inlet 24. To facilitate manufacture the second duct 23 is of minimum bore for a short length in the vicinity of theair ouflet 28.<br><br>
In the second configuration shown in Figures 4 and 5 the bottle 11 is shown with the device 16 secured in place by the capsule 13 in a known manner. This can be readily achieved in a conventional bottle filling and sealing line by holding the perimeter 20 of the device 16 in a recess 40 in a rigid disc 41 mounted In the capsule 13. The machine in the botthng line whereby the capsule is located on the bottle and compressed around the neck 12 can readily cope with the loading necessary to drive the device 16 home into the neck 12. The neck 12 is configured on its outer surface to receive the capsule and hold it in place against inadvertent axial or rotary displacement. Typically the bottle 12 is provided with a recess 43 into which recessed ring 44 is driven. Region 45 of the capsule provides a deliberately weakened section of the capsule so that when the bottle 12 is to be opened relative twisting of the upper part 46 and lower part 47 of the capsule to be separated allowing for the use of upper part 46 as a screw cap for the bottle when in use. In removing the upper part the disc 41 is separated fi-om the device 16 to leave the rim 20 exposed and allow the ready pouring of a steady flow of liquid from the bottle.<br>
From the point of view of pouring the device 16 provides a number of advantages. In particular liquid is not dispensed from the bottle by way of the device 16 until axis a of the bottle 11 has been tilted fi-om the vertical by about 90 degrees. In addition the baffle 30 limits the ability of the contents of the bottle, especially when half fiall or less, to surge towards and through liquid flow inlet end 24 of the first duct 22. Any moving liquid hitting the barrier 30 is constrained to flow around it so dissipating kinetic energy.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The invention provides an economical and effective means for resisting counterfeiting of valuable original liquids.<br><br>
While the exemplary embodiments describes a container in the form of a bottle for a liquid comprising an alcoholic beverage the invention is capable of application towards many types of container apart from bottles, such as cans and containers of metal, plastics material or treated card, and for many types of liquid apart from alcoholic beverages such as non-alcoholic beverages and essences, flavourings liquid foods, oils (both edible and those intended for oils and lubricants for machinery) and additives. The invention provides for a liquid container which while providing for the ready dispensing of the contents resists the refdling of the bottles and in particular resists the ready introduction of bogus liquids. As was pointed out earlier it is a common practice in certain parts of the world to take advantage of brand or other identity on a given bottle by retaining the displayed identity while filling the bottle with a cheap imitation of the original liquid. The present invention provides a device which is cheap to manufacture and readily adopted for existing bottling or container filling processes which provides resists illicit filling. Quite apart fi-om its defensive function the mvention also provides a closure through which a liquid can be readily dispensed in a controlled manner fi"om a container equipped with the closure.<br><br><br>
