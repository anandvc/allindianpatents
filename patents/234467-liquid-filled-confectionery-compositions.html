(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
'LIQUID-FILLED CONFECTIONERY COMPOSITIONS'<br>
CADBURY   SCHWEPPES  PLC,  Berkeley   Square,   London,  United Kingdom<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
LIQUID-FILLED CONFECTIONERY COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to liquid-filled confectionery compositions and methods of making the same.    More particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention, in one embodiment, relates to liquid-filled chewing gum compositions and <br>
5           methods of manufacturing the same.<br>
Liquid-filled chewing gum and other confectionery compositions are known in the art and typically comprise a liquid core material encapsulated within a solid coating of gum or other confectionery.<br>
A common problem with such compositions arises as a result of the tendency for <br>
10       moisture present in the liquid centre and/or die atmosphere to ingress into the solid gum or other confectionery coating over time. This ingress of moisture can be detrimental to the integrity of the composition for a number of reasons. Firstly, the moisture content of the liquid centre will reduce over time as moisture gradually migrates into the surrounding coating and this will in turn cause the liquid fill present in the composition <br>
15      to become gradually less hydrated and more concentrated over time. Secondly, the coating itself will soften as its moisture content increases, which can be detrimental to the appearance and properties (taste, texture etc.) of the coating.<br>
Various attempts to limit the migration of moisture from the liquid core into the solid coating of conventional liquid-filled gum compositions by modifying the <br>
20     composition and properties of the encapsulated liquid are described in United States Patent Numbers 3,894,154 (Graff et al.), 4,156,740 (Glass et al.), 4,157,402 (Ogawa et al.) and 4,466,983 (Cifrese et al.). However, although modifying the composition of the encapsulated liquid can reduce the amount of moisture migration occurring between the liquid core and the coating, a liquid-filled chewing gum/confectionery composition in<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
which the migration of moisture is minimised further, or eliminated altogether, remains desirable.<br>
Furthermore, moisture migration from the liquid core into the solid coating can be a particular problem in chewing gum or other confectionery compositions which<br>
5                comprise a low viscosity liquid filling. Low viscosity liquid fillings can be desirable for certain confectionery products because release of a low viscosity liquid during consumption provides a unique taste sensation. However, the prior art compositions referred to above all seek to increase the viscosity of the liquid fill in order to retard moisture migration.  Alternative gum/confectionery compositions which are capable of<br>
10                accommodating any liquid filling, including low viscosity liquids, are desirable.<br>
Conventional processes known in the art for forming centre-filled gum and other confectionery are relatively complex, typically involving the steps of forming the gum or other confectionery coating and then introducing a liquid fill into the centre of the gum or other confectionery by a suitable means.   One example of such a process is<br>
15               described in International Patent Publication Number WO 02/15708 and consists of the extrusion of a so-called "rope" of liquid-filled chewing gum from a continuous extruder. This rope of liquid-filled gum is formed into individual pellets by a die assembly, which effectively crimps off individual pieces of gum from the rope. While this and other such processes are effective in continuously forming individual pieces of liquid filled gum,<br>
20             they tend to be complex procedures and require specialised equipment. Furthermore, the size of the gum pieces formed is typically large (generally of the order of 1 to 2 centimetres in length) and problems arise in adapting these processes to produce smaller pieces (e.g. 1.5 grams in weight or less) of liquid-filled gum or other confectionery compositions, which are desirable for certain applications.<br>
—2-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
The problems referred to above are addressed by the present invention. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a liquid-filled confectionery composition comprising:<br>
a)  a core, wherein said core contains a liquid;<br>
5	b) an outer coating or shell which encapsulates said core; and<br>
	c)  an intermediate layer disposed between said core and said outer coating;<br>
             wherein  said  core  comprises  a  liquid  encapsulated  within  a  water soluble  or<br>
            biodegradable matrix layer and said intermediate layer is adapted to minimise           <br>
liquid<br>
            migration out of said core.<br>
10	Such confectionery compositions address the problems associated with the prior<br>
art compositions identified above. Specifically, the provision of a liquid-containing core in which the liquid is encapsulated within a water-soluble matrix provides a convenient means by which any suitable liquid fill, including low viscosity liquids, can be incorporated into, and contained within, a confectionery composition. Furthermore,<br>
15       the provision of an intermediate layer which is disposed between the outer coating and the liquid containing core provides a protective barrier which minimises moisture migration out of the core. The barrier provided by the intermediate layer may prevent moisture migration out of the core. Thus, in the final product, the barrier minimises or prevents moisture migrating from the liquid-containing core into the outer coating. <br>
20    Hence, the intermediate layer minimises moisture migration and increases the stability of the composition.<br>
Further, advantageously, this barrier may protect the integrity of the liquid-containing core from moisture present during the application of the outer coating layer<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br><br>
or layers, by minimising or even preventing moisture migration into the liquid-containing core.<br>
Furthermore, suitable liquid-containing cores are commercially available. Thus,<br>
the intermediate layer and outer layer can be conveniently coated directly onto these<br>
5                 commercially available cores using conventional coating techniques.    Hence,      the<br>
drawbacks associated with the techniques for the forming conventional liquid-filled gum<br>
or other confectionery compositions can be avoided.<br>
          For the avoidance of doubt, the term "core" is used herein to specify the  innermost part of the composition.  The core may take any suitable shape.  The final <br>
10                  product formed from the composition may also be of any shape.<br>
           The liquid present in the liquid-containing core may be any suitable liquid composition suitable for use in a confectionery composition. In particular, the liquid composition may comprise one or more flavouring agents, which may be natural or synthetic flavouring agents. Illustrative examples of suitable flavouring agents include <br>
15                peppermint and speannint oils and essences; citrus oils including lemon, orange, lime and grape fruit; fruit essences including apple, peach, pear, apricot, grape, cherry, plum, pineapple and strawberry; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other ingredients such as sweeteners, softeners and buffering agents may also be present in the liquid. Suitable buffering agents are well known to those skilled in the <br>
20               art, as are suitable sweeteners and softeners. Illustrative examples of suitable sweeteners and the typical ranges in such constituents may be present are described at page 4, line 8, to page 6, line 11, of International Patent Publication No. WO 96/11582 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Illustrative examples of suitable softeners that may be present in the compositions of the invention are also<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
provided at page 6, lines 14 to 24, of International Patent Publication No. WO 96/11582 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
In certain embodiments, the liquid comprises one or more essential flavour oils.<br>
The water soluble or biodegradable matrix, which encapsulates the liquid to<br>
5    form the liquid-containing core of the composition, may be formed from any suitable<br>
water soluble and/or biodegradable matrix-forming material. The matrix may be formed<br>
by one or more water soluble hydrocolloids.    Illustrative examples of suitable<br>
hydrocolloids include gelatin, sodium alginate and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable liquid-containing cores are commercially available from major flavour<br>
10    house companies, such as, for example, MANE Fils SA of 620 route de Grasse, 06620<br>
Le bar Sur Loup, France or SYMRISE. These commercially available liquid-containing<br>
cores are typically spherical capsules containing one or more flavouring agents, typically<br>
essential oils, encapsulated within a gelatin (or another suitable hydrocolloid) matrix.<br>
These commercially available liquid-containing cores are generally known in the art as<br>
15    "capsules of flavours" and are obtainable in a range of different sizes and flavours. The<br>
size of the pearls of flavours selected for use in the compositions of the present<br>
invention will  depend on  the application  concerned  and  the  final size of the<br>
confectionery composition required. In certain embodiments of the invention, the pearls<br>
of flavour have diameters of between 3 and 10 millimetres and thereby enable small<br>
20    pieces of confectionery to be produced (i.e. confectionery pieces of 1.5 grams or less in<br>
weight).<br>
The intermediate layer of the confectionery composition may be any suitable edible layer which, once formed, can minimise moisture migration out of the liquid-containing core. The intermediate layer may be a water impermeable layer, operative to<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
prevent moisture migration into and out of the liquid-containing core. As previously indicated, the intermediate protective layer may perform an important function by minimising moisture contacting die liquid-containing core during die remainder of die manufacture process (i.e. during the subsequent application of a confectionery coating)<br>
5    and thereby adversely affecting die water soluble matrix of me core. It also minimises moisture migrating from the liquid core into the outer confectionery coating during storage. The intermediate layer may be formed by coating the liquid-containing core with a coating solution which does not disturb the integrity of die water soluble or biodegradable matrix of the liquid-containing core.   For example, if the matrix is a<br>
10    water soluble matrix, then the intermediate layer may be applied in any suitable nonaqueous solution, such as, for example, an alcohol-based solution.<br>
The intermediate layer may comprise arabic gum. The intermediate layer may comprise maltodextrines or any other suitable binding ingredients. It may also comprise other constituents, such as, for example, a sugar alcohol (e.g. maltitol). The amount of<br>
15     arabic gum present in the intermediate layer may be 100% of the layer.<br>
The intermediate layer may be applied to the liquid-containing core as an alcoholic solution and then dried to yield the intermediate layer.<br>
The intermediate layer may be coated directly onto the surface of die liquid-containing core.<br>
20	Usually one layer of intermediate protective coating will suffice, although<br>
several layers may be present Where several layers are present, each layer may have me same or a different composition.<br>
The outer coating may comprise any suitable confectionery coating that is known in the art   For instance, an outer confectionery coating may be in the form of a hard<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
confectionery shell, or it may be in the form of a chewable composition, such as chewing gum coating or any other soft chewable candy composition. The selection of an appropriate outer coating will depend on the type of confectionery product desired and can be easily carried out by a person skilled in the art.<br>
5	The confectionery compositions of the present invention may be chewing gum<br>
 compositions in which the outer confectionery coating is a chewing gum coating.<br>
The chewing gum coating may comprise any gum base constituents known in the   art. Illustrative examples of suitable polymers mat can be used as constituents of the gum base can be found at page 7, lines 10 to 24, of International Patent Publication No.<br>
10   WO 96711582 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). In embodiments of the invention in which the liquid-containing core is a commercially available pearl of flavour (as discussed above), the gum base typically contains at least one of the following gum base constituents: low and/or high molecular weight polyvinyl acetate; glycerol monostereate; vegetable oils (such as hydrogenated vegetable oil);<br>
15   microcrystalline petroleum wax or paraffin wax. The composition may comprise a mixture of some or all of the aforementioned constituents.<br>
The amounts of polymer utilised in the gum base will depend on the properties of me gum base desired. Typical amounts of polymer found in the gum base are disclosed at page 7, lines 25 to 34, of International Patent Publication No. WO 96/11582<br>
20    (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The gum base may further comprise one or more additional agents such as, for example, sweeteners, elastomer solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, softeners, fillers, colouring agents, flavouring agents, antioxidants, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative examples of such agents and the typical ranges in which they may be employed can be<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
found at page 8, line 1, to page 11, line 13 of International Patent Publication No. WO 96/11582 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
In  embodiments of the  invention  where the liquid-containing core  is  a commercially available capsule of flavour, the gum base may comprise one or more <br>
5     intense sweetening agents that provide a long lasting sweetening effect Examples of such sweeteners include aspartame and acesulfam K.<br>
In embodiments where the composition comprises a fruit flavour (in the liquid<br>
        core and/or the outer chewing gum base), then flavour enhancers such as citric acid, for<br>
        example, may also be incorporated into the gum base.<br>
10            In some embodiments, the gum base may comprise various hydrochlorides,<br>
   polyols and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
The gum base may constitute anywhere between S and 90%, such as between 10 and   80%, of the entire confectionery/chewing gum composition. The actual percentage of gum  base present will depend on the individual confectionery composition <br>
15     concerned.<br>
 The chewing gum coating may be further coated with an additional   confectionery layer in order to provide a hard outer shell. Any suitable hard outer coating layer, such as a sugar or sugar alcohol-based coating, or a mixture thereof, may be used. Examples of suitable sugar alcohols that may be used to form the additional <br>
20 confectionery layer include sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, isomalt and lactitol. The   aforementioned sugar alcohols may be used alone or in admixture with one another.<br>
            The additional confectionery layer may optionally comprise any other suitable constituents, such as, for example, gelatin and arabic gum.<br>
-?-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be of any shape or form that is desired.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of     making a confectionery composition as defined herein, said method comprising the <br>
5            steps of:<br>
(1)	providing a core, wherein said core contains a liquid;<br>
(2)	coating said core with said intermediate layer; and<br>
(3)	coating the product of the step (2) with an outer layer.<br>
          The compositions of the invention can be conveniently formed by the application 10    of the intennediate, protective, layer coating to the liquid-containing core, followed by the   <br>
application of the outer coating.   Each coating step may be performed more than once,   if so desired, to provide several individual layers of a given coating.<br>
The coating process may be carried out as a batch process or a continuous<br>
        coating process.<br>
15	Any suitable coating technique may be used. For instance, the coating steps may<br>
be carried out by using conventional pan coating techniques. Once a coating solution has been applied, the coated compositions are then dried to yield the coated layer before the next coating step is commenced.<br>
As previously indicated, the intermediate protective coating layer formed in step<br>
20    (2) above may be applied as a coating solution which does not disturb the integrity of<br>
the water soluble or biodegradable matrix of the liquid-containing core. Therefore, in<br>
embodiments where the matrix of the liquid core is a water soluble matrix, the use of an<br>
aqueous coating solution must be avoided.<br>
16-<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCT/GB2004/004807<br><br>
In embodiments where the outer coating is a chewing gum coating, the method of making the compositions of the invention will further comprise an additional step in which the chewing gum coating is prepared for application in step (3) of the coating process defined above. The chewing gum coating may comprise granules of chewing <br>
5         gum base, which may be prepared by a granulation process. Said granulation process may comprise the following steps:<br>
(a)	mixing the gum base ingredients to form (he required gum base<br>
composition; and<br>
(b)	cooling the gum base composition formed in step (a) and grinding the<br>
10	gum base into granules.<br>
The mixing of the gum base ingredients may be carried out at any suitable temperature, although the temperature is typically below 70°C when the flavours are added to the gum base composition.<br>
The gum base composition may be mixed by introducing the constituents into a <br>
15         kneader. This can be carried out as a continuous process or as a batch process.<br>
Similarly, any suitable grinding process, such as the use of a knife grinder, may be used to reduce the gum base into granules.<br>
Once formed, the granules of gum base may then be subjected to an additional<br>
screening step to select granules within a desired size range for use in the coating<br>
20        process. The screening is usually carried out by passing the granules through a mesh.<br>
Granules of less than 1000 microns in size may be used, such as granules of less than<br>
500 microns.<br>
The chewing gum coating is applied to the liquid-containing core which has been coated by the intermediate layer formed by step (2).   The chewing gum base<br><br>
WO 2005/048728	PCTYGB2004/004807<br>
granules may be dispersed into a suitable coating solution. Any suitable coating solution will suffice. The coating solution may comprise, in addition to the gum base granules, one or more hydrocolloids, such as arabic gum, and/or one or more polyols, or a mixture thereof.  The coating step may be repeated several times until the required<br>
5    amount of gum coating has been deposited.<br>
The process of producing the compositions of the invention may optionally include an additional step whereby any gaps between the individual granules of gum base forming the gum coating layer prepared in step (3) are filled by the application of a fine powder that disperses into said gaps and thereby increases the uniformity and<br>
10   continuity of the gum coating layer. Any suitable fine powder may be used for this purpose, such as, for example, a powdered polyol or icing sugar.<br>
In embodiments of me invention in which the confectionery/chewing gum coating is further coated with a hard outer confectionery shell, die method of the present invention may further comprise an additional step in which the chewing gum coating<br>
15    formed in step (3) above is coated again to provide with said hard outer confectionery shell. Any suitable hard confectionery shell composition known in the art may be used in the compositions of die present invention. The outer shell may be formed from a sugar alcohol, such as maltitol, and may be applied by introducing a sugar alcohol syrup to coat me external surface of the outer confectionery/chewing gum layers of the<br>
20    composition produced in step (3). The sugar alcohol syrup is then dried to yield the hard outer confectionery shell.<br>
The hard outer confectionery shell present in certain embodiments of the invention provides a smooth surface which can be cleaned and polished to provide an elegant finish to the compositions of the invention, if desired.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
'LIQUID-FILLED CONFECTIONERY COMPOSITIONS'<br>
This invention concerns a liquid-filled confectionery composition (10), comprising a liquid-containing core (11, 12), an outer layer of confectionery coating (14, 15), and an intermediate protective layer (13) between the core (11, 12) and outer layer (14, 15). The liquid-containing core consists of a liquid (11) contained within a water soluble or biodegradable matrix (12). The edible water impermeable intermediate layer (13) is applied in alcohol and prevents the movement of water between the core (11, 12) and the outer layer (14,15), thereby preventing the core (11,12) from drying out.<br>
