				<td>Process for the preparation of alkyl N-alkylanthranilate<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkyl N-alkylanthranilate of the Formula 1.<br>
 \  Wherein R1 and R2 contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, are alkyl, substituted alkyl, or alkyl containing  <br>
a saturated ring.<br>
More particularly it is concerned with the preparation of	<br>
MethylN-methylanthranilate, Formula I, R1 = R2 = Me	<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Methyl N-methylanthranilate (DMA) is a valuable compound used in the flavouring<br>
and fragrance industry and is also reported to be a bird, repellent described in patent<br>
US 2,967,128.<br>
Several methods are known for the preparation of DMA.<br>
A classical route is N-methyiation of methyl anthranilate with a methylating agent as<br>
dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide, cited in patent DE 3936229. To avoid<br>
dimethylation, reductive methylation with formaldehyde and hydrogen has been<br>
described in patent US 4633009. Reaction scheme I.<br><br>
1<br><br>
To prepare methyl anthranilate, 2H-3,l-benzoxazine-2,4 (lH)-dione (isatoic<br>
anhydride) is reacted under alkaline conditions<br>
with methano] as disclosed in patent IN 146359, Reaction scheme 2.<br><br>
As disclosed by Staiger, J. Org. Chem. (1959), 24,1214-19 , N-methylisatoic anhydride reacts with methanol under alkaline conditions to produce Methyl N-raethylanthranilate.<br>
Hardtmann, J. Heterocycl. Chem. (1975), 12 (3), 565-72 prepares N-substituted isatoic anhydride by reacting the N-sodium salt of isatoic anhydride, prepared from sodium hydride, with alkyi halides. The N-benzyl derivative of isatoic anhydride is prepared using potassium carbonate and benzyl chloride.<br>
Disclosure of invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a fecile process for the preparation<br>
of N-alkyl alkylanthranilates, specially N-methyl meihylaiithranilate, in commercial<br>
quantities, good yield and high purity.<br>
An obvious route would be a one pot synthesis starting with the ready available isatoic anhydride, N-alkylation and final reaction with an alcohol to furnish the title product. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of alkyi esters of N-alkylanthranilic acid represented by Formula 1<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, are alkyl, substituted alkyl, or alkyl containing a saturated ring, said process comprising the steps of.<br>
2<br><br>
reacting 2H-3, l-benzoxazine-2,4 (lH)-dione (isatoic anhydride) in a polar aprotic organic solvent, such as herein described, as medium, with a solid metal hydroxide or basic metal oxide, such as herein described; adding an alkylating agent, such as herein described; reacting the intermediate with an alkyl alcohol, such as herein described; and<br>
isolating the product according to Formula 1 by adding water to the reaction mixture and extracting with a non water miscible organic solvent, such as herein described.<br>
Preferably, the polar aprotic solvent is selected from the group comprising of an aliphatic carboxamide, an aliphatic nitrile, an aliphatic ether, an aliphatic sulphoxide, or hexaalkyl phosphoric triamide. More preferably, the polar aprotic solvent is dimethyl formamide or 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone.<br>
Preferably, the solid metal hydroxide or basic metal oxide has the metal part selected from the group comprising of Li, Na, K, Ca and Ba. More preferably, the metal hydroxide is sodium hydr6xide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
Preferably, the alkylating agent is an alkyl halide, wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to 8 V carbon atoms, are alkyl substituted alkyl or alkyl containing a saturated ring and the halide is<br>
represented by  Cl, Br or I. More preferably, the alkylating agent is a dialkyl ester of sulfuric acid (dialkyl sulfate) wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, are alkyl, substituted alkyl or alkyl containing a saturated ring.Most preferably the alkylating agent is dimethyl sulfate<br>
 Preferably, the alkyl alcohol is a primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl alcohol or an alcohol containing a cyclic aliphatic structure, with up to a maximum of 8 carbon atoms, for the final ring opening process. More preferably, the alkyl alcohol is methanol.<br>
Preferably, the non water miscible organic solvent is a C 5-10 linear, branched, or cyclic alkane or an ether for isolating the final product by extraction. More preferably, the non water miscible organic solvent is hexane.<br>
Surprisingly it turned out that a solid metal hydroxide or basic metal oxide, preferable sodium or pottasium hydroxide in a suitable polar solvent such as dimethylforamide or l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone could form the N-metal salt with isatoic anhydride.<br><br>
Depending on solvent, concentration or temperature the metal salt would separate<br>
to form a dispersion.<br>
One would anticipate that water formed during the salt formation immediately<br>
would react with isatoic anhydride, forming anthranilic acid.<br>
Surprisingly this was not the case.<br>
Trials using metal alkoxides resulted in that the alkohols formed, reacted with<br>
isatoic anhydride to form alkyl esters of anthranilic acid.<br>
N-methylation could be achieved by adding an alkylation agent. Preferably<br>
methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate in a molar ratio, relative to isatoic anhydride,<br>
from 1 to 5, preferably 1.5, at a temperature from 10 - 40 C. In the case of a<br>
methylating agent, the intermediate N-methylisatoic anhydride could be isolated by<br>
filtration as a colourless crystalline compound by adding 2 parts of water to the<br>
reaction mixture. Identification was established by compare HPLC chromatograms<br>
with authentic material (supplied by Aldrich).<br>
After N-alkylation of isatoic anhydride has been performed 1 to 50 mole parts of an<br>
alkyl allcohol, relative to isatoic anhydride, is added to  the reaction mixture at a<br>
temperature between 10 and 40°C. The temperature is elevated to distil excess of<br>
alkyl alcohol off. Leaving 50% to 0% of the alcohol in the reaction mixture.<br>
Preferably 10%.<br>
By alcohol addition under alkaline conditions, N-alkylisatoic anhydride, is ring<br>
opened, forming alkyl N-alkylanthranilate with subsequent elimination of<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
Alkyl N-alkylanthranilate is isolated by adding 1 to 5 parts of water to the reaction<br>
mixture, and extract the mixture with a non water miscible organic solvent.<br>
The extraction solvent could be an alicyclic or cyclic hydrocarbon, halogenated<br>
derivatives hereof, aliphatic ethers or esters. Preferably hexane.<br>
The organic phase is washed with water, and evaporated in vacuo, leaving<br>
alkyl N-allcylanthranilate as an oil with purity about 97% and yield<br>
about 85%.<br>
