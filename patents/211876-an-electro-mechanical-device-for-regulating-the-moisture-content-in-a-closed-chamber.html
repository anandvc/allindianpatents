Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dehumidifier in general and in particular to an electro-mechanical device for regulating the moisture content in a closed chamber. More accurately the invention relates to a method for regulating moisture and the associated means for electronic devices storage or drying of industrial and agricultural commodities. Related art<br>
The dehumidification (reduction in the moisture content) is an inevitable requirement in the areas of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, preservation of food commodities that are kept for longer durations and drying of agricultural commodities cultivated in high humid areas. More over, the electronic equipments like chips, CDs etc and optical devices especially camera, lenses etc. which are prone to fungi attacks are needed to be kept away from humidity for achieving maximum performance and life long usage.<br>
There are many techniques available to reduce the moisture content in the air. In chemical dehydration technique, the moisture sorbents like silica gel, molecular sieve and activated alumina (adsorbents), lithium chloride (absorbent) etc are used as such or along with moisture controlling devices. They are used as powders, granules, discs etc. according to the requirements.<br>
Air compression is a suitable method of reducing moisture content in air. With the application of compressed air, partial pressure of the water vapour in the water-gas mixture is raised to the point where moisture can be condensed from the air at a higher temperature. This approach is some times quite practical for very small volumes of air but the cost of compressed equipment, BHP requirement and the amount of cooling water required for after-cooling make it very impractical for large volumes of air.<br>
Another method most commonly employed is the reduction of moisture in the air by means of reducing the temperature. By cooling the air below the dew point, the moisture contained in that air can be condensed out and some of the moisture vapour removed in liquid form, but cooling to very low temperature makes the refrigeration process impractical, as it requires a great deal of subsequent re-heating. The reduction in air temperature is also limited by the freezing point of water condensing on the cooling coil,<br><br>
which in some designs is tried to be offset by complicated brine spray and liquid lithium chloride type systems available using a combination of refrigeration and adsorbent liquid but these are very bulky and involve complicated control systems for the proper maintenance of solution density.<br>
There are a few inventions available related with the regulation of the dehumidification of air in a chamber. Japanese Pat. No. 2003-214683 describes an invention of an inexpensive dehumidification machine with easy control, which corresponds to a variety of dehumidification modes. The machine carries a heating element for maintaining the moisture absorbing agent at a constant temperature for regeneration by heating it at a home position and a fan for carrying out dehumidification of a room by passing indoor air through the moisture absorbing member and returning it to the room. Here, no provision has been given to throw out the moisture full air to the outside of the cabin or preserve back the dehumidified air without permitting to get mixed with the air contained in the chamber. This will deteriorate the efficiency of the process. More over, automatic moisture level detecting facility has not been applied in the above invention. Jap.Pat.No 2002-361026 provides an electric dehumidifying machine being a dry dehumidifying machine provided with a hygroscopic element and having improved hygroscopic performance by providing an air fan, a hygroscopic element, a heating means for heating air passed through the hygroscopic element to remove moisture absorbed by the hygroscopic element and a heat exchanger. Here also no automatic moisture level detecting facility has been applied which can regulate the moisture content with respect to needs. Jap.Pat.No 08-075227 accomplishes a dehumidifier and air-conditioning machine consisting of a humidifying unit which consisting of an absorbent, constituted of the honeycomb type formed body of silica gel containing lithium chloride, a heater for heating the absorbent, a fan for sending air to the absorbent, and a damper for switching the duct of air after passing the absorbent installed at the outside of the building. This invention is only suited for big chamber and other two draw backs mentioned in the above patents still applied to this. Jap. Pat. No 2004-057986 relates with the dehumidification apparatus consisted of a humidity measuring means for measuring humidity of dry air discharged from a separation membrane module, a flow rate adjusting means for adjusting the flow rate of the purge air to a purge air supply part,<br><br>
and a control means. The control means outputs a control signal which is continuously changed so that level of humidity measured by the humidity measuring means can agree with a humidity set value set by a humidity setting device to the flow rate adjusting means, and thereby the flow rate of the purge air is continuously adjusted. Even though the machine provides a humidity level detecting system, it is rather expensive.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there is a need of an improved dehumidification technique or machine which can regulate the moisture of any chamber with increased efficiency by providing continuous passage of moisture-full air to the outer of the chamber, reusage of moisture sorbents and application of automatic moisture level detecting facility which can regulate the moisture content with respect to needs. Such machines can be applied for many areas if enabled to operate in minimum electricity and made flexible with respect to chamber size.<br>
With a view to provide an improved and inexpensive electro-mechanical device for regulating the moisture content in a closed chamber, the invention proposes a device having the features of detecting and reducing the moisture level of chemicals (reusable moisture adsorbents kept inside the device). More over, the device accomplishes a reduced level of moisture in the chamber effectively by using an air flow controlling system from the device to outer atmosphere and from the closed chamber to the device with the aids of glass valves, runner mechanism, fans etc.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the invention is to regulate the dehumidification in a chamber by means of an electro-mechanical device.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an improved and efficient dehumidification technique by implementing the facilities of continuous flow of moisture-full air from the chamber to the outer atmosphere, reusage of moisture sorbents and applying automatic moisture level detecting facility that can regulate the moisture content with respect to needs.<br><br>

In order to facilitate a better understanding of the invention a detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the disclosed<br><br>
embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art as how to make or use the invention. Structure<br>
The figures 1 and 2 give the structural aspects of the invention. A heating Plate (36) is fixed inside the center of the perforated stainless steel Box (7) in which moisture adsorbents (29) are kept compact. Between the Heating Plate (36) and the upper deck of the Perforated Stainless Steel Box (7), a Perforated Stainless Steel Plate (28) is immersed in moisture adsorbents without touching the Perforated Stainless Steel Box (7) and the Heating Plate (36). The tip of the Heating Plate is projected to the outer side of the perforated Stainless Steel Box where the thermostat switch (9) is fixed. This equipment is situated in a bigger Box (8) with air current facilities from all sides hence ensuring no electric contact between Perforated Stainless Steel Box (7) and the Box (8). The outside of the Box (8) excluding the area of four holes (6a, 6b, 6c, 6d) is completely covered with polyurethane foam (PUF) (46) and is fixed at the centre of the lower deck of the chamber (1). The chamber is spacious enough and can be closed and opened easily and the door (18) is airtight fitted with Beading. The valve (6c) on one side of the Box (8) and the other one (6a) opposite to the box are in contact with air outside the chamber (1) through separate pipes (43a, 43b). The other valves (6b, 6d) of the box are in contact with air in the chamber. The DC fans (27a, 27b) are fixed outside opposite to the valve holes (6a, 6b) respectively on one side of the Box (8). The fan size is fixed in accordance with the diameter of the holes (6a, 6b).<br>
Figure 3 details about the runner mechanism or valve operating mechanism forming part of the invention. The mechanism is attached to a set of two-way Glass Valves (2a, 2b) fixed on opposite sides of the box (8). One of the valves (2a) consists of a rectangular-shaped glass plate (4a) where two holes exist at a fixed distance and arranged in such a way that a glass shutters (5a) that slides along the glass plate in a glass channel (35a) shutting any one of the holes completely [The similar features repeated for (2b)]. There are two sets of cables in which one ends of the inners (lOal, 10a2) are connected to the Glass Shutters (5a, 5b) of the Glass Valves (2a, 2b) and one ends of the Outers (10M,<br><br>
10b2) to the Glass Plates (4a, 4b) using fixers respectively. The other ends of the inners are connected to the Runner (13) in the Runner Mechanism and the other ends of the outers to the Runner Base (15) of the Runner using the fixers. The Runner (13) is in turn connected to the DC Motor (11) through the Gear Sets (12). Leaf Switches (3a, 3b) are fixed in the Runner Base (15) in such a way that when the Runner (13) moves to one side, the Runner Stopper (14) presses the Button Leaver of a Leaf Switches and turns it off. When the Leaf Switch is in ON position, Leaf Switch Button Leaver will be free.<br>
Figure 4 gives the features of electrical connection to the air flow controlling system. The primary terminals (44a25 44b2) of the second transformer (32b) are connected to 230VAC. The secondary Terminal of the Second Transformer is connected to the Bridge Rectifier (38). The Positive and Negative Terminals coming from a Bridge Rectifier (38) are respectively connected to the Positive and Negative leads of an Electrolyte Capacitor (39a). The positive terminal coming from bridge rectifier (38) is connected to the first terminal (45a) of a positive regulator IC (45), the third terminal of IC (45c) is connected to the negative DC terminal and the second terminal of the IC (45b) stays as regulated positive output. The regulated DC Positive output (45b) is connected with the DC Terminal through Thermostat Switch (9) via the Coil Terminals of the two-pole two-way relay (37). The regulated DC positive output (45b) is connected to the Negative DC Terminal through the first Normal Connection (37a-37c) of the Two-Pole Two-Way Relay (37), the Second Leaf Switch (3b), first terminal (11a) via second terminal (lib) of motor (11) and the Second Normal Connection (37e- 37b) of the two pole two-way Relay (37) in sequence. The regulated DC Positive output (45b) is connected to the Negative DC Terminal through the first order Connection (37a-37d) of the two-pole Two-way Relay, the first Leaf Switch (3a), second terminal (lib) via first terminal (11a) of motor (ll)and the Second Order Connection (37f-37b) of the two pole two-way relay in sequence. The regulated DC Positive output (45b) is connected to the Negative DC Terminal through the first Normal Connection (37a-37c) of the Two Pole Two-Way Relay (37), a variable resistor (48), switch (49), the fan (27b) and the second normal connection (37e-37b) of the two pole two-way relay in sequence. The regulated DC positive output (45b) is connected to the negative DC Terminal through first order<br><br>
connection (37a-37d) of the two pole two-way relay, the fan (27a) and the Second Order Connection (37f- 37b) of the two pole two-way relay in sequence.<br>
Figure 5 gives the electrical circuit details of the switching means used for regulating electric supply to the perforated stainless steel box. The Primary Terminals (44al, 44bl) of the first Transformer (32a) are connected with the 230VAC Terminals. The first secondary Terminal (32al) from the First Transformer (32a) is connected to the Perforated Stainless Plate (28) through Variable Resistor (33) via the Gate Terminal (34g) and the First Terminal (34a) of the Triac (34) and the second Secondary Terminal (32a2) of the first transformer (32a) to the Perforated Stainless Steel Box (7) through the Resister (30b). The Second Terminal of the Triac (34b) is connected to the first 230VAC Terminal (44al) through Heating Coil (26) in the Heating Plate (36). The First Terminal (34a) of the Triac is connected to the Second 230 VAC Terminal (44bl). The first L.E.D. (31a) is connected to the 230VAC terminals (44a 1, 44b 1) through Resister (30a). The Second L.E.D. (31b) is connected to the first 230 VAC terminal (44al) through Resistor (30c) from the Second Terminal (34b) of the Triac (34). Operation<br>
The electric current from the First Secondary Terminal (32al) of the First Transformer reaches the Perforated Stainless Steel Plate (28) through Variable Resistor (33), the Gate Terminal (34g) of the Triac, first terminal of the triac (34a) and complete the circuit by passing through moisture adsorbents (29), perforated Stainless Steel Box (7), the Resistor (30b) and the second Secondary Terminal (32a2) of the Transformer (32a). The measure of electricity passed by the moisture adsorbents is proportional to the measure of moisture adsorbed by them and hence they act as a variable resistor (29) (indicated in fig 5&amp;fig 6) in the circuit controlled in accordance with the moisture adsorbance. Similarly, the triggering voltage developed by the electricity also proportional to the moisture adsorbance. When the triggering volt reaches the Gate Terminal (34g) of the triac (34), an electric connection is established between the First and Second Terminal (34a-34b) via second LED (31b). This indicates the maximum limit of humidity content of the air in the chamber controlled from outside using the variable resistors (33a), (33b) and (48) and switch (49).<br><br>
When triac triggers, the 230VAC reaches the Heating Coil (26) of the Heating Plate (36) through the first and second terminal (34a, 34b) of the Triac, the heating plate gets heated and the Thermostat switch (9) fixed on the heating plate (36) turns on. The regulated DC positive voltage comes from regulated DC positive out put (45b) reaches Negative DC terminal through thermostat switch (9) and Two Pole Two Way relay (37) coil terminals and holds the relay. By this time, regulated DC positive Voltage from the regulated DC Positive Terminal reaches Negative DC terminal through the First order connection (37a - 37d) of the Two Pole Two Way relay, the First Leaf Switch (3a) which fixed on the Runner Base (15), the Second Terminal (lib) via the First Terminal (1 la) of the Motor (11) and the Second Order Connection of the Two Pole Two Way relay (37f-37b) in sequence. Now the Motor (11) works and the Runner (13) moves along the Runway (42). The Glass Shutters (5a, 5b) facing the holes (6a,6c) that opened to the atmospheric air from the Box (8) move in the Glass Channels (35a, 35b) with the help of Cable Inners (lOal, 10a2) fixed on the Runners and come face-to-face with the holes (6b,6d) that open to the chamber from the Box (8). In this position, the air in the Box (8) loses contact with the air in the chamber (1) and comes in touch with the atmospheric air through the pipes (43 a, 43 b) via the valve holes (6a, 6c). The Runner Stopper (14) presses the Button Lever (21a) of the First Leaf Switch (3 a) and turns off the electric connection to the Motor (11). In this position, the Button Lever of the Second Leaf Switch (3b) will be free the Switch will be in ON position.<br>
Regulated Positive DC Voltage from the Regulated DC Positive Terminal reaches the Negative DC Terminal through the first connection (37a - 37d) of the Two Pole Two-Way relay (37), the Fan (27a) and the Second Order Connection (37f - 37b) and the fan starts working. The fan sucks the atmospheric air through the pipe (43b) which passes through Box (8) and return back to the outer atmosphere (outside the chamber) through the pipe (43a). Thus a current of atmosphere air is created inside the box (8)<br>
With the Heating Plate (36) getting heated, the moisture adsorbents (29) too heat up and the moisture adsorbed goes out as vapour and gets discharged into the atmosphere air inside the box (8) and again to the outside of the chamber(l). The continuous flow of hot vapor heat up the box (8) but the polyurethene foam (PUF) (46) covering prevents the heat to spread inside the chamber. As the process advances, the quantity of water<br><br>
adsorbed in the moisture adsorbents gets reduced and proportionately reducing the flow of electricity through adsorbents. When the flow of electricity becomes not sufficient to sustain the triggering voltage in the gate terminal (34g) of the triac (34), the triggering voltage goes below the threshold value and the electric connection to the first and second terminals (34a, 34b) of the Triac cuts off. Similarly, as the electric connection to the Second 230VAC terminal (44b 1) through the second and the First Terminal (34a - 34b) of the Triac via the Heating Coil (26) from the first 230 VAC terminal (44al) gets cut off. The coil starts cooling down along with the heated adsorbents in the perforated stainless steel box and the cooling rate gets accelerated by the fan (27a). When the heat of the Heating Plate (36) comes to a normal stage, the Thermostat Switch (9) turns off, the DC Voltage Connection to the Terminals in the Two- Pole Two-Way Relay coil cuts off and the Order Connections (37d-37a, 37f - 37b) get disconnected. Thus the DC Positive Volt from regulated DC positive terminal reaches the DC Negative Terminal through the First Normal Connection (37a - 37c) of the Two- Pole Two-Way Relay (37), the Second Leaf Switch (3b), the Second Terminal (lib) via the First Terminal (11a) of the Motor (11) and the Second Normal Connection (37e - 37b) of the Two Pole Two Way Relay (37) in sequence. Since the flow of current changes the direction, the Motor (11) starts working in the opposite direction. The shutters (5a, 5b) move from the prior position and come face-to-face with the Holes (6a, 6c) of the Box (8) opening into the atmospheric air. When the Runner Stopper (14) presses against the Button lever (21b) of the Leaf Switch (3b), it turns off followed by the electric connection to the motor gets disconnected. In this position, the Button lever (21a) of the First Leaf Switch (3a) becomes free and switch turns on. Since, the Order Connections (37d - 37a, 37f - 37b) of the Two Pole Two Way relay stay disconnected the electric connection to the fan (27a) cuts off. At the same time, the regulated Positive DC Volt from the regulated DC Positive Terminals reaches to Negative DC terminal by passing through the First Normal Connection (37a - 37c) of the Two Pole Two Way Relay, variable resistor (48), switch (49), the Fan (27b) and the Second Normal Connection (37e - 37b) of the Two Pole Two Way Relay in sequence and the Fan (27b) starts working.<br>
The air in the chamber (1) is sucked to the Box (8) through the hole (6d) by fan (27b) and returns to the chamber through the hole (6b) where the fan is fixed: The air<br><br>
passing through the Box comes in contact with the moisture adsorbents (2a), which adsorb the moisture content in the air. The process is repeated till the moisture content in the chamber is removed at required level. As the quantity of water adsorbed by the moisture adsorbents (29) gets increased, the passing of electricity also increases and the Triac (34) triggers when it gets enough triggering voltage which reaches its Gate Terminal. Electric connection is established between the First and Second Terminal (34a - 34b) and the 230VAC reaches the Heating Coil (26) of the Heating Plate (36) through the first and Second Coil of the Triac. Consequently, the Heating Plate (36) gets heated followed by the repetition of the activities described above.<br>
In some cases, the inconsistent triac voltage may not be sufficient to heat the heating coil at constant rate for long time. So another way of electric means is implemented to deliver 230VAC to the coil consistently and its structure and operation are followed. Figure 6 gives the detailed electrical circuit used for regulating electric supply to the heating coil. The Primary Terminals of the first Transformer (32a) is connected with the 230VAC Terminals (44al, 44b 1). The first secondary Terminal (32al) from the First Transformer (32a) is connected to the Perforated Stainless Plate (28) through Variable Resistor (33a) via the Gate Terminal (34g) and the First Terminal (34a) of triac and the second Secondary Terminal (32a2) from the first transformer (32a) to the Perforated Stainless Steel Box (7) through the Resister (30b). The second terminal (34b) of triac is connected to the first 230VAC terminal (44al) through the primary terminal of the third transformer (32c). The secondary terminal of the third transformer is connected to the bridge rectifier (38b) through a variable resister (33b) and the positive and negative terminals of the bridge rectifier (38b) are connected to the positive and negative leads of an electrolyte capacitor (39b) respectively. The first (50a) and the third (50c) terminals of a positive voltage regulator IC (50) are connected to the positive and negative DC terminals respectively. The second terminal (50b) of the positive voltage regulator IC (50) stays as regulated positive output. A regulated positive output (50b) is connected to the negative DC terminal through the coil terminals of a single- pole oneway relay (51). The second 230VAC (44bl) is connected to the first 230VAC (44al) through the order connection (51a-51b) of the single- pole one-way relay (51) and heating coil (26). The first L.E.D. (31a) is connected to the 230VAC terminals (44al,<br><br>
44bl) through Resister (30a). The second 230VAC (44b 1) is connected to the first 230VAC (44al) through the order connection (51a-51b) of the single- pole one-way relay (51), resister (30c) and the second L.E.D (31b).<br>
When the triac (34) triggers, 230VAC from second 230VAC terminal (44b 1) reaches to first 230VAC terminal (44al) via first and second terminals of triac (34a-34b) and the primary coil of the third transformer (32c). As a result, the output voltage generated in the secondary coil of the transformer reaches to the positive voltage regulated IC (50) via second variable resister (33b) and second bridge rectifier (38b) and thus generated regulated positive voltage reaches to negative DC terminals through the coil terminals of single-pole one-way relay (51) and holds the relay. The heating coil (26) starts heating when 230VAC from the second 230VAC terminal (44b 1) passing through single-pole one-way relay (51). When the triggering voltage is not sufficient for generating 230VAC in the primary coil of the third transformer (32c), the relay (51) may not be able to hold and disconnect the heating coil (26) from the circuit. All other processes are same to that of discussed earlier.<br>
The humidity of the air in the chamber can be adjusted at any level from the normal humidity of the atmospheric air to 0% by adjusting resistance of the Variable Resistors (33a, 33b&amp;48) and switch (49) from outside.<br>
