Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In<br>
particular, the invention is directed to novel heterocyclic amidines and their<br>
use for inhibiting the enzyme Cls, a protease in the classical pathway of the<br>
complement system; and the use of this inhibition to treat or ameliorate acute<br>
or chronic disorders in mammals.<br>
Related Art<br>
The immune system of the human body is equipped with several<br>
defense mechanisms to respond to bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection and<br>
injury. One such defense mechanism involves the complement system.<br>
Complement consists of a complex series of approximately 30 plasma and<br>
membrane protein components, many of which are proteinases. Once<br>
activated, this system of enzymes non-specifically complements the<br>
imrnunologically specific effects of antibody by modulating the immune<br>
response, lysing target cells, stimulating vascular and other smooth muscle<br>
cells, facilitating the transport of immune complexes, producing<br>
anaphylatoxins which cause degranulation of mast cells and release of<br>
histamine, stimulating chemotaxis (migration) of leukocytes toward the area of<br>
complement activity, activating B lymphocytes and macrophages, and<br>
inducing phagocytosis and lysis of cells (Eisen, H. N., Immunology, Harper &amp;<br>
Row Publishers, Inc., Hagerstown, Md., p. 512 (1974); Roitt, I. et al.,<br>
Immunology, Gower Medical Publishing, London, New York, pp. 7.1-7.14<br>
(1985); U.S. Patent Nos. 5,472,939 and 5,268,363).<br>
The complement system functions as a "cascade." The enzyme<br>
cascades are initiated when inactive enzyme precursor molecules are activated,<br>
through limited proteolysis, by membrane-bound enzymes. A small fragment<br>
is lost from the enzyme precursor and a nascent membrane binding site is<br>
revealed. The major fragment then binds to the membrane as the next<br>
functionally active enzyme of the complement cascade. Since each enzyme is<br>
able to activate many enzyme precursors, the system forms an amplifying<br>
cascade, resembling the reactions seen in blood clotting and fibrinolysis (Roitt,<br>
I. et al., Immunology, Gower Medical Publishing, London, New York, pp. 7.1-<br>
7,14(1985}).<br>
The proteins of the complement system form two inter-related enzyme<br>
cascades, termed the classical and alternative pathways. The classical<br>
pathway is usually initiated by antigen-antibody complexes, while the<br>
alternative pathway is activated by specific polysaccharides, often found on<br>
bacterial, viral, and parasitic cell surfaces. The classical pathway consists of<br>
components C1-C9, while the alternative pathway consists of components C3-<br>
C9 (excluding C4) and several factors, such as Factor B, Factor D, and<br>
Factor H.<br>
The sequence of events comprising the classical complement pathway<br>
consists of three stages: recognition, enzymatic activation, and membrane<br>
attack leading to cell death. The first phase of complement activation begins<br>
with C1. C1 is made up of three distinct proteins: a recognition submit, C1q,<br>
and the serine proteinase subcomponents, C1r and C1s, which are bound<br>
together in a calcium-dependent tetrameric complex, C1r2S2. An intact C1<br>
complex is necessary for physiological activation of C1 to result. Activation<br>
occurs when the intact C1 complex binds to immunoglobulin complexed with<br>
antigen. This binding activates C1s which then cleaves both the C4 and C2<br>
proteins to generate C4a and C4b, as well as C2a and C2b. The C4b and C2a<br>
fragments combine to form the C3 convertase, which in turn cleaves C3 to<br>
form C3a and C3b (Makrides, Pharmacol Rev. 5(9:59-87 (1998); and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,268,363). Both the classical and alternative pathways are capable<br>
of individually inducing the production of the C3 convertase to convert C3 to<br>
C3b, the generation of which is the central event of the complement pathway.<br>
C3b binds to C3b receptors present on neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes<br>
and macrophages, thereby activating the terminal lytic complement sequence,<br>
C5-C9 (Roitt, I. et al.. Immunology, Gower Medical Publishing, London, New<br>
York, pp. 7.1-7.14 (1985)).<br>
Complement is designed to fight infection and injury; however, this<br>
same mechanism, if inappropriately activated, can cause a significant amount<br>
of inflammation and tissue damage as a result of the rapid and aggressive<br>
enzyme activity. Complement-induced inflammation and tissue damage has<br>
been implicated in a number of disease states, including: the intestinal<br>
inflammation of Crohn's disease which is characterized by the lymphoid<br>
infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Ahrenstedt et<br>
al., New Engl. J. Med. 322:1345-9 (1990)), thermal injury (burns, frostbite)<br>
(Gelfand et al., J. Clin. Invest. 70:1170 (1982); Demling et a!., Surgery<br>
106:52-9(1989)), hemodialysis (Deppisch et al., Kidney fast. 37:696-706<br>
(1990); Kojima et al., Nippon Jenzo Gakkai Shi 31:91-7 (1989)), post pump<br>
syndrome in cardiopulmonary bypass (Chenoweth et al., Complement.<br>
Injlamm. 5:152-165 (1981); Chenoweth et al., Complement 3:152-165 (1986);<br>
Salama et al., N. Engl. J. Med. .318:408-14 (1988)), and ischaemia (Huang et<br>
al., Science 285:595 (1999); Naka et al., Transplantation (54:1248 (1997);<br>
Pemberton et al., J. Immunol 750:5104 (1993); Chavez-Cartaya et al.,<br>
Transplantation 59:1047 (1995); Hill et al., J. Immunol. 149:1723 (1992);<br>
Weisman et al., Science 249:146 (1990)). Both complement and leukocytes<br>
are reported to be implicated in the pathogenesis of adult respiratory distress<br>
syndrome (Zilow et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:151-57 (1990); Langlois et al.,<br>
Heart Lung 75:71-84 (1989)). Activation of the complement system is<br>
suggested to be involved in the development of fatal complications in sepsis<br>
(Hack et al., Am. J. Med. 86:20-26 (1989)) and causes tissue injury in animal<br>
models of autoimmune diseases such as immune-complex-induced vasculitis<br>
(Cochrane, Springer Seminar Immunopathol. 7:263 (1984)),<br>
glomerulonephritis (Couser et al., Kidney Inst. 29:879 (1985)), type II<br>
collagen-induced arthritis (Watson &amp; Townes,J. Exp. Med. 7(52:1878 (1985)),<br>
and experimental allergic neuritis (Feasby et al., Brain Res. 419:91 (1987)).<br>
The complement system is also involved in hyperacute allograft and<br>
hyperacute xenograft rejection (Knechtle et al., J. Heart Transplant 4(5):54l<br>
(1985); Guttman, Transplantation 77:383 (1974); Adachi et al., Trans. Proc.<br>
19(1):1145 (1987)). Complement activation during immunotherapy with<br>
recombinant IL-2 appears to cause the severe toxicity and side effects<br>
observed from IL-2 treatment (Thijs et al., J. Immunol. 144:2419 (1990)).<br>
Complement fragments generated by the classical portion of the<br>
complement cascade have been found to be present in the immune complexes<br>
formed against indigenous tissue in autoimmune diseases. Such diseases<br>
include, but are not limited to: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, glomerulonephritis<br>
and cutaneous lesions of systemic lupus erythematosus, other<br>
glomerulonephritides, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis,<br>
Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, insulin<br>
resistance, autoimmune hemolyic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenic<br>
purpura, and rheumatoid arthritis (Biesecker et al. J. Exp. Med. 154: 1779<br>
(1981); Biesecker et al., N. Engl J. Med. 306: 264 (1982); Falk et al.., Clin.<br>
Research 32:503A (Abstract) (1984); Falk et al., J. Clin. Invest. 72:560<br>
(1983); Dahl et al., J. Invest. Dennatol 52:132 (1984); Dahl et al., Arch.<br>
Dermatol. 121:70 (1985); Sanders et al., Clin. Research 35:388A (Abstract)<br>
(1985); and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,268,363 and 4,722,890).<br>
Compounds that potently and selectively inhibit complement will have<br>
therapeutic applications in several acute and chronic immunological and non-<br>
immunological disorders, and a. variety of neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
Evidence from both human and animal studies shows that activation of the<br>
classical complement pathway is primarily involved in neurodegenerative<br>
diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Autoimmune diseases in which<br>
these inhibitors of the complement cascade system will be therapeutically<br>
useful include myasthenia gravis (MG), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus. Neurodegenerative diseases in which inhibitors of the<br>
complement cascade system, will be therapeutically useful include the<br>
demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS), the neuropathies Guillain-<br>
Barre syndrome (GBS) and Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), Alzheimer's<br>
disease (AID), and prion-related disease (variant Creutzfeld Jacob disease).<br>
Other diseases and conditions include hereditary and acquired angioedema (in<br>
which a deficiency in complement inhibitory protein leads to an active<br>
complement consumption and repeated episodes of life-threatening<br>
angiodema), septic shock, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, organ<br>
rejection (transplantation), burns (wound healing), brain trauma, soft tissue<br>
trauma, asthma, platelet storage, hemodialysis, isehemia-reperfusion injury,<br>
and cardiopulmonary bypass equipment (Makrides, Pharmacol. Rev. 50:59-87<br>
(1998); Spiegel et al., Strategies for Inhibition of Complement Activation in<br>
the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases in: Nenroinflammation:<br>
Mechanisms and Management, Wood (ed.), Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ,<br>
Chapter 5, pp. 129-176; and U.S. Patent No. 4,916,219).<br>
A number of strategies have been proposed for the inhibition of<br>
primarily the classical complement pathway. Efforts to directly inhibit<br>
complement activation have focused on chemical compounds that inhibit<br>
complement components such as C1r and C1s. Small peptide inhibitors of<br>
convertases, such as the C3 and C5 convertases., have also been described<br>
(Liszewski and Atkinson, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 7: 323-332 (1998). So far,<br>
the best studied 'designer' complement inhibitor for treatment of CNS<br>
disorders is soluble recombinant human complement receptor Type 1 (sCR1).<br>
sCR1 has proven effective in animal models of CNS diseases and is under<br>
investigation for use in man (Fearon, Clin. Exp, Immunol. 86 (Suppl.l):43-46<br>
(1991)). However, there are several drawbacks to the use of sCRl in disorders<br>
of the CNS: the agent is expensive, must be administered systemically, and<br>
has a short half-life in vivo. The next generation of complement inhibitors are<br>
likely to solve many of these drawbacks (Spiegel et al.., Strategies for<br>
Inhibition of Complement Activation in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative<br>
Diseases in: Nenroinflammation: Mechanisms and Management, Wood (ed.),<br>
Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ, Chapter 5, pp. 129-176).<br>
A need continues to exist for non-peptidic compounds that are potent<br>
inhibitors of complement, specifically C1s, and which possess greater<br>
bioavailability and fewer side-effects than currently available C1s inhibitors.<br>
Accordingly, novel C1s inhibitors, characterized by potent inhibitory capacity,<br>
are potentially valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of conditions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a novel class of thienyl amidines. The<br>
thienyl amides of Formula I inhibit the enzyme C1s, a protease in the classical<br>
pathway of the complement system, and thus, can be used to treat or<br>
ameliorate complement-mediated acute or chronic disorders in mammals.<br>
Thus, a first aspect of the present invention is directed to novel<br>
compounds of Formula I.<br>
In a second embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for treating acute and<br>
chronic disorders associated with activation of the classical pathway of the<br>
complement system by administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. These acute<br>
and chronic conditions are caused either in whole or in part by inflammation<br>
and tissue damage that result from aberrant activation of the complement<br>
cascade.<br>
In one embodiment, compounds of Formula I can be administered to a<br>
mammal to treat complement-mediated inflammation and tissue damage.<br>
Examples of conditions that can be treated include intestinal inflammation of<br>
Crohn's disease, thermal injury (burns, frostbite), post pump syndrome in<br>
cardiopulmonary bypass, and ischaemia (stroke, myocardial infarction,<br>
ischaemic colitis, hemorrhagic shock, trauma, post-surgical tissue damage and<br>
delayed or impaired function of organ or graft following transplant).<br>
The complement system is activated in hyperacute allograft and<br>
hyperacute xenograft rejection, and in acute humoral rejection mediated by<br>
donor-specific antibodies. Thus, in yet another embodiment, compounds of<br>
Formula I can be administered to a mammal before, during or after the<br>
transplant of an organ or a graft to ameliorate the rejection of such organ or<br>
graft by the mammal. Grafts can include an allograft or xenograft.<br>
Complement activation during immunotherapy with recombinant IL-2<br>
appears to cause acute vascular leak syndrome that results in the severe<br>
toxicity and side effects observed from IL-2 treatment and other conditions<br>
such as bone marrow transplantation and acute pancreatitis. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula I is<br>
administered to a mammal before, during or after treatment of said mammal<br>
with IL-2, bone marrow transplantation, or onset of pancreatitis, in an amount<br>
effective to reduce the vascular leak syndrome that causes toxicity and side-<br>
effects associated with the treatment or disorders.<br>
In another embodiment., compounds of Formula I can be administered<br>
to a mammal to treat complement-mediated tissue injury associated with<br>
autoimmune diseases. Examples of autoimmune diseases that are treatable<br>
according to the present invention include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's<br>
disease, glomerulonephritis and cutaneous lesions of systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, other glomerulonephritides, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus,<br>
Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, immune-complex-induced<br>
vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, myasthenia gravis, allergic neuritis, myasthenia<br>
gravis, Type I diabetes mellitus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura, type II collagen-induced arthritis, and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. Autoimmune diseases preferred for treatment by inhibitors of the<br>
present invention include myasthenia gravis (MG), rheumatoid arthritis, and<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I<br>
to a mammal that has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
Neurodegenerative diseases m winch inhibitors of the complement cascade<br>
system will be therapeutically useful include the demyelinating disorder<br>
multiple sclerosis (MS), the neuropathies Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and<br>
Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS)., Alzheimer's disease (AD), and variant<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<br>
In another embodiment, compounds of the present invention can be<br>
administered to a mammal to treat complement-mediated complications in<br>
sepsis, or symptoms of adult respiratory distress syndrome.<br>
Other diseases and conditions that can be treated include hereditary<br>
and acquired angioedema, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, brain trauma<br>
and other soft tissue trauma, asthma and hemodialysis.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can also be employed in vitro for human<br>
organ and graft storage as well as platelet storage.<br>

The term "heteroatom" is used herein to mean an oxygen atom ("O"), a<br>
sulfur atom ("S") or a nitrogen atom ("N"). It will be recognized that when the<br>
heteroatom is nitrogen, it may form an NRyRz moiety, wherein Ry and Rz are,<br>
independently from one another, hydrogen or C1 to C8 alkyl, or together with<br>
the nitrogen to which they are bound, form a saturated or unsaturated 5-, 6-, or<br>
7-membered ring.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" as employed herein refers to groups having 5 to<br>
14 ring atoms; 6, 10 or 14 % electrons shared in a cyclic array; and containing<br>
carbon atoms and 1, 2 or 3 oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur heteroatoms (where<br>
examples of heteroaryl groups are: thienyl, benzo[b]thienyl,<br>

The expression "prodrug" denotes a derivative of a known direct acting<br>
drug, which derivative has enhanced delivery characteristics and therapeutic<br>
value as compared to the drug, and is transformed into the active drug by an<br>
enzymatic or chemical process. Useful prodrugs are those where R2, R3 and/or<br>
R4 are -CO2RW, where Rw is defined above. See U.S. Patent No. 5,466,811<br>
and Saulnier et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4:1985-1990 (1994).<br>
The term "substituted," as used herein, means that one or more<br>
hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a selection from the<br>
indicated group, provided that no atom's normal valency is exceeded, and that<br>
the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e.,<br>
=0), then 2 hydrogens attached to an atom of the moiety are replaced.<br>
By "stable compound" or "stable formula" is meant herein a compound<br>
that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from<br>
a reaction mixture and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.<br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in<br>
any Formula, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition<br>
at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables<br>
are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
Methods of Use<br>
The present invention provides a method for treating acute and chronic<br>
disorders associated with activation of the classical pathway of the<br>
complement system by administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I.<br>
These acute and chronic conditions include inflammation and tissue<br>
damage that arise as a result of rapid and aggressive enzyme activity of the<br>
complement cascade. Complement-mediated inflammation and the resultant<br>
tissue damage has been implicated in a number of disease states including:<br>
1) ischaemia reperfusion damage, such as occurs post myocardial infarction,<br>
post transplant, post surgery and in hemorrhagic shock; 2) antibody-mediated<br>
conditions, such as hyperacute allograft and xenograft rejection, organ<br>
transplant rejection and auto-immune diseases; and 3) other disease states,<br>
such as thermal injury., trauma, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),<br>
sepsis and prion disease.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are believed to inhibit the<br>
functioning of the protease activity of C1s. This protease-inhibition activity<br>
results in the inhibition or blocking of a variety of complement-mediated<br>
immunological functions. Therefore, compounds of Formula I can be used to<br>
ameliorate a number of disease states induced by complement-mediated<br>
inflammation and tissue damage.<br>
The term "treatment of inflammation" or "treating inflammation" is<br>
intended to include the administration of compounds of the present invention<br>
to a subject for purposes which can include prophylaxis, amelioration,<br>
prevention or cure of an inflammatory response. Such treatment need not<br>
necessarily completely ameliorate the inflammatory response. Further, such<br>
treatment can be used in conjunction with other traditional treatments for<br>
reducing the inflammatory condition known to those of skill in the art.<br>
By an "efficacious level" of a composition of the invention is meant a<br>
level at which some relief is afforded to the patient who is the recipient of the<br>
treatment. By an "abnormal" host inflammatory condition is meant a level of<br>
inflammation in the subject at a site which exceeds the norm for the healthy<br>
medical state of the subject, or exceeds a desired level. By "secondary" tissue<br>
damage or toxic effects is meant the tissue damage or toxic effects which<br>
occur to otherwise healthy tissues, organs, and the cells therein, due to the<br>
presence of an inflammatory response, including as a result of a "primary"<br>
inflammatory response elsewhere in the body.<br>
The "animals" referred to herein are preferably mammals and most<br>
preferably humans, although the invention is not intended to be limited to<br>
such.<br>
In one embodiment, compounds of Formula I can be administered to a<br>
mammal to treat complement-mediated inflammation and tissue damage that<br>
is a consequence of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Thus, the C1s inhibitors of<br>
the present invention can be employed to prevent, or at least ameliorate,<br>
inflammation and tissue damage: arising from a stroke, myocardial infarction,<br>
hemorrhagic shock, and surgery. In particular, compounds of Formula I can<br>
be employed to prevent inflammation of transplanted tissue and organs.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can also be provided as a "preventive"<br>
treatment before detection of an inflammatory state, so as to prevent the same<br>
from developing in patients at high risk for the same, such as, for example,<br>
transplant patients.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be used to treat chronic or acute<br>
inflammation that is the result of an antibody-mediated reaction, such as<br>
hyperacute allograft and xenograft rejection, organ transplant rejection and<br>
auto-immune diseases, which include arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple<br>
sclerosis (MS), type I diabetes, intestinal inflammation of Crohn's disease,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), immune-complex-induced vasculitis,<br>
restenosis and psoriasis.<br>
The complement system is activated in hyperacute allograft and<br>
hyperacute xenograft rejection, and in acute humoral rejection mediated by<br>
donor-specific antibodies. In another embodiment, compounds of Formula I<br>
can be administered to a mammal before, during or after the transplant of an<br>
organ or a graft to ameliorate the rejection of such organ or graft by the<br>
mammal.<br>
Organ transplant and graft patients undergo concurrent<br>
immunotherapy. Complement activation during immunotherapy with<br>
recombinant IL-2 appears to cause acute vascular leak syndrome that results in<br>
the severe toxicity and side effects observed from IL-2 treatment and other<br>
conditions such as bone marrow transplantation and acute pancreatitis. Thus,<br>
in a further embodiment of the present invention, a compound of Formula I is<br>
administered to a mammal before, during or after treatment of said mammal<br>
with IL-2, bone marrow transplantation, or onset of pancreatitis, in an amount<br>
effective to reduce the vascular leak syndrome that causes toxicity and side-<br>
effects associated with the treatment or disorders.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to<br>
administering a therapeutically effective compound of Formula I to a mammal<br>
that has been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases<br>
that are treatable according to the present invention include Addison's disease.<br>
Type I diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, glomerulonephritis and<br>
cutaneous lesions of systemic lupus erythematosus, other<br>
glomerulonephritides, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis,<br>
Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, insulin<br>
resistance, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenic<br>
purpura, immune-complex-irtduced vasculitis glomerulonephritis, type II<br>
collagen-induced arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic neuritis.<br>
Autoimmune diseases preferred for treatment by inhibitors of the present<br>
invention include myasthenia gravis (MG), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount, of a compound of Formula I<br>
to a mammal that has been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
Neurodegenerative diseases in which inhibitors of the complement cascade<br>
system will be therapeutically useful include the demyelinating disorder<br>
multiple sclerosis (MS)., the neuropathies Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and<br>
Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and variant<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).<br>
In another embodiment, efficacious levels of the C1s inhibitors of the<br>
invention are administered so as to provide therapeutic benefits against the<br>
secondary harmful inflammatory effects of inflammation.<br>
In an additional embodiment, compounds of the present invention can<br>
be administered to a mammal suffering from the symptoms of ARDS. ARDS<br>
is a complex pulmonary disorder affecting 150,000 people in the U.S. yearly<br>
with a 50% mortality rate. Leukocytes, platelets and the proteolytic pathways<br>
of coagulation and complement mediate ARDS. ARDS involves activation of<br>
the contact activation pathway and depletion of C1 inhibitor and may be<br>
induced by either sepsis or trauma. Sepsis-induced ARDS results in more<br>
severe Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIG) and fibrinolysis, more<br>
fibrin degradation products and reduced ATIII levels compared to trauma-<br>
induced ARDS (Carvalho et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 112:270-277 (1988)).<br>
In. a further embodiment, compounds of Formula I can be administered<br>
to a person in septic shock. Septic shock is the most common cause of death<br>
of humans in intensive care units in the United States (Parillo et al., Ann. Int.<br>
Med. 113:227-242 (1990); Schmeichel C. J. &amp; McCormick D., BioTechnol.<br>
10 :264-267 (1992)). In recent years aggressive fluid infusion therapy has been<br>
accepted as a primary means of treatment for septic shock.<br>
The increase in cardiac output and vasodilation in septic shock is<br>
attributed to the action of inflammatory mediators. In septic shock,<br>
components of the kallikrein-kinin system are depleted, suggesting activation<br>
of this system. This is not the case in cardiogenic shock, suggesting that the<br>
kallikrein-kinin system is a key player in septic shock (Martinez-Brotons F. et<br>
al., Thromb. Haemostas. 55:709-713 (1987)). While the actual events leading<br>
to septic shock, DIC and hypotension have not been established, the known<br>
interactions among various components of the many physiological systems<br>
suggest that activation of the contact pathway may lead to a state of septic<br>
shock, multi-organ failure, and death (Bone, R. C, Arch. Intern. Med.<br>
752:1381-1389 (1992); Gorman, R. W., New Engl. J. Med. 32(9:1207-1209<br>
(1989)). The contact activation pathway is also involved in both fibrin<br>
deposition and lysis, as well as triggering neutrophil activation, activation of<br>
complement and modulation of blood pressure.<br>
Inhibition of the complement cascade is expected to lead to<br>
downstream utilities associated with the contact system of coagulation and the<br>
complement system. This interaction between components of the complement<br>
and coagulation systems at the surface of blood platelets and endothelium can<br>
generate inflammatory and chemotactic peptides at sites of vascular thrombus<br>
formation and may contribute to the altered hemostasis associated with<br>
immune disease states. In addition, immune reactions affecting blood platelets<br>
and endothelium can lead to platelet aggregation, the secretion of proteolytic<br>
enzymes and vasoactive amines from platelet storage granules, and increase<br>
adherence of platelets and leukocytes to the endothelial lining of blood<br>
vessels.<br>
Other diseases and conditions that can be treated with compounds of<br>
Formula I include hereditary angioedema, paroxysmal nocturnal<br>
hemoglobinuria, wound healing, brain trauma, asthma, hemodialysis,<br>
infection, dermatosis, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis,<br>
esteoarthritis, thermal injury (burns and frostbite), hemolytic anemia and post<br>
pump syndrome in cardiopulmonary bypass.<br>
It has been demonstrated that membrane-uptake of C3b and C5b-9<br>
proteins can occur spontaneously during incubation of platelets in citrated<br>
plasma. Complement activation can also occur during blood collection as a<br>
result of exposure to plastic surfaces supporting the C3-convertase reaction.<br>
While the implications of complement activation during blood collection and<br>
in vitro storage for transfusion have not been directly addressed, it is<br>
nevertheless known that plasma levels of coagulation factors V and VIII<br>
rapidly decline in stored platelet concentrates at a rate considerably faster than<br>
their decay in cell-free plasma, suggesting consumptive loss. Further, platelet<br>
collection and storage is associated with an increase in vesicular plasma<br>
membrane microparticles, a product of C5b-9 initiated platelet secretion.<br>
These physiological and enzymatic changes greatly reduce the potential shelf<br>
life of stored platelets, particularly platelet-rich plasma concentrates used for<br>
transfusions, which is generally only 72 hours at best. Furthermore, this<br>
interaction of activated C5b-9, platelets, and coagulation factors in stored<br>
platelet concentrates will adversely affect the hemostatic effectiveness of these<br>
units when infused.<br>
In vitro human organ and tissue storage and survival of the<br>
transplanted graft is also adversely affected by the spontaneous activation of<br>
the complement system, resulting in membrane insertion of the C5b-9 proteins<br>
into vascular endothelium. Activation of C5 to C5a and C5b can be catalyzed<br>
by plastics and other synthetic membranes required to maintain perfusion of<br>
vascular beds during in vitro tissue and organ storage. In addition, membrane<br>
deposition of C5b-9 in vivo has been implicated in the acute rejection of<br>
transplanted tissue due to immune activation of the recipient's plasma<br>
complement system against the endothelial cells within the donor's organ.<br>
Platelet and endothelial cell activation by C5b-9 also has ramifications<br>
in autoimmune disorders and other disease states. The importance of<br>
spontaneous complement activation and the resulting exposure of platelets and<br>
endothelium to activated C5b-9 to the evolution of vaso-occlusive disease is<br>
underscored by consideration that a) leukocyte infiltration of the<br>
subendothelium, which is known to occur in regions of atheromatous<br>
degeneration and suggests localized generation of C5a at the vessel wall, is<br>
potentially catalyzed by adherent platelets; and b) local intravascular<br>
complement activation resulting in membrane deposition of C5b-9 complexes<br>
accompanies coronary vessel occlusion and may affect the ultimate extent of<br>
myocardial damage associated with infarction.<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide a means and<br>
method for the modulation and inhibition of complement-mediated platelet<br>
and endothelial cell activation in vivo and in vitro.<br>
It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide a means and<br>
method for increasing the survival and therapeutic efficacy of platelets and<br>
tissues or organs collected and stored in vitro.<br>
Preferably, the treatment methods of the invention deliver the C1s<br>
inhibitor either by contacting cells of the animal with a C1s inhibitor described<br>
above or by administering to the animal a C1s inhibitor described above.<br>
The inhibitors can be used in vitro or in vivo. They can be<br>
administered by any number of known routes, including orally, intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally, topically, transdermally, and<br>
by infusion (Platt et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,510,130; Badalamente et al., Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 55:5983-5987 (1989); Staubli et al., Brain Research<br>
444:153-158 (1988)) and will generally be administered in combination with a<br>
physiologically acceptable carrier (e.g., physiological saline) or diluent. The<br>
effective quantity of inhibitor given will be determined empirically and will be<br>
based on such considerations as the particular inhibitor used, the condition of<br>
the individual, and the size and weight of the individual. It is to be expected<br>
that the general end-use application dose range will be about 0.01 to 100 mg<br>
per kg per day, preferably 0.1 to 75 mg per kg per day for an effective<br>
therapeutic effect.<br>
Amounts and regimens for the administration of C1s inhibitors and<br>
compositions of the invention can be determined readily by those with<br>
ordinary skill in the clinical art of treating inflammation-related disorders such<br>
as arthritis, tissue injury and tissue rejection. Generally, the dosage of the<br>
composition of the invention will vary depending upon considerations such as:<br>
type of pharmaceutical composition employed; age; health; medical conditions<br>
being treated; kind of concurrent treatment, if any; frequency of treatment and<br>
the nature of the effect desired; extent of tissue damage; gender; duration of<br>
the symptoms; and contraindications, if any, and other variables to be adjusted<br>
by the individual physician. A desired dosage can be administered in one or<br>
more applications to obtain the desired results. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing the C1s inhibitors of the invention can be provided in unit dosage<br>
forms.<br>
la one embodiment, dosing will be by intravenous injection or short-<br>
term infusion. In a further embodiment, the C1s inhibitors of the present<br>
invention will be administered orally, in the form of a tablet, pill, lozenge,<br>
troche or capsule. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect, maintenance dosing<br>
may be required. Such maintenance dosing may be given repeatedly during the<br>
course of a day by, for instance, repeated individual injections, repeated oral<br>
dosing, or by introduction of a continuous drip infusion. Effective dosages<br>
can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine<br>
trials establishing dose response curves.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for treating a complement-mediated<br>
disease state, comprising a compound of Formula I in an amount effective to<br>
inhibit C1s protease function in a mammal and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier or diluent, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of the<br>
C1s inhibitors of the invention, in combination with any conventional<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, are included in the present<br>
invention.<br>
For medicinal use, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts,<br>
those salts in which the anion does not contribute significantly to toxicity or<br>
pharmacological activity of the organic cation, are preferred. The acid<br>
addition salts are obtained either by reaction of an organic base of Formula I<br>
with an organic or inorganic acid, preferably by contact in solution, or by any<br>
of the standard methods detailed in the literature available to any practitioner<br>
skilled in the art. Examples of useful organic acids are carboxylic acids such<br>
as maleic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
isethionic acid, succinic acid, cyclamic acid, pivalic acid and the like; useful<br>
inorganic acids are hydrohalide acids such as HC1, HBr, and HI; sulfuric acid;<br>
phosphoric acid and the like. Preferred acids for forming acid addition salts<br>
include HC1 and acetic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered<br>
to any animal that can experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of<br>
the invention. Foremost among such animals are humans, although the<br>
invention is not intended to be so limited.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be<br>
administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example,<br>
administration can be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal, or ocular routes. Alternatively, or<br>
concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. The dosage<br>
administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the<br>
recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the<br>
nature of the effect desired..<br>
In addition to the pharmacologically active compounds, the new<br>
pharmaceutical preparations can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the<br>
active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are<br>
manufactured in a manner that is, itself, known, for example, by means of<br>
conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing<br>
processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by<br>
combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the<br>
resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable<br>
auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.<br>
Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for<br>
example, lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or<br>
calcium phosphates, for example, tncalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, as well as binders, such as, starch paste, using, for example, maize<br>
starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added,<br>
such as, the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-<br>
linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as,<br>
sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and<br>
lubricants, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as,<br>
magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee<br>
cores are provided with suitable coatings that, if desired, are resistant to gastric<br>
juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which<br>
may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene<br>
glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents<br>
or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices,<br>
solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as, acetylcellulose phthalate<br>
or hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments<br>
can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification<br>
or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include<br>
push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of<br>
gelatin and a plasticizer, such as, glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules<br>
can contain the active compounds in the form of granules that may be mixed<br>
with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as<br>
talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the<br>
active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids,<br>
such as, fatty oils or liquid paraffin.. In addition, stabilizers may be added.<br>
Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous<br>
solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-<br>
soluble salts, alkaline solutions and cyclodextrin inclusion complexes.<br>
Especially preferred salts are hydrochloride and acetate salts. One or more<br>
modified or unmodified cyclodextrins can be employed to stabilize and<br>
increase the water solubility of compounds of the present invention. Useful<br>
cyclodextrins for this purpose are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,727,064,<br>
4,764,604, and 5,024,998.<br>
In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily<br>
injection suspensions can be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or<br>
vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid<br>
esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400<br>
(the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions can<br>
contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, for example,<br>
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the<br>
suspension may also contain stabilizers.<br>
When employed as thrombin inhibitors, the compounds of the present<br>
invention may be administered in an effective amount within the dosage range<br>
of about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg, preferably between about 0.1 and about 10<br>
mg/kg body weight, on a regimen in single or 2-4 divided daily doses.<br>
Methods of Making<br>
Many synthetic methods used to form compounds of the present<br>
invention generally involve the formation of an amidine from a carboxylic<br>
acid derivative, such as an ester. In the process a Lewis acid, such as<br>
trimethylaluminum, is added to a source of ammonia, such as ammonium<br>
chloride, in an aprotic solvent, such as a toluene, under an inert atmosphere<br>
(e.g., under an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon gas) at a temperature between<br>
-15°C and 5°C, preferably at 0°C. An appropriate carboxylic acid derivative<br>
is added to the mixture and the mixture is heated at reflux for a predetermined<br>
period of time, preferably between 1 hr. and 24 hrs., and most preferably<br>
between 1 hr. and 4 hrs. The resulting solution is allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature and the amidine product is isolated by known methods.<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates a general approach to compounds of Formula /<br>
where X = O or S, and R1 = alkylthio, aralkylthio, arylthio, alkyloxy,<br>
aralkyloxy or aryloxy. Starting with the heterocycle where X = O or S<br>
appropriately substituted by a leaving group, the leaving groups can be<br>
sequentially displaced by an appropriate thiol to produce the 4-substituted<br>
heterocycles. In some cases a disulfide and a reducing agent such as<br>
triphenylphosphine can be used for the in situ generation of the thiol.<br>
Examples of leaving groups include chlorine, bromine or iodine. The resulting<br>
sulfide is oxidized, either to the sulfoxide or the sulfone with an appropriate<br>
oxidizing agent such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide<br>
in acetic acid. When the 4-substituent is a sulfone, the nitro group can then be<br>
displaced by an appropriate; nucleophile (preferably the anion of the group R1<br>
to be substituted) to produce a 5-substituted heterocycle. Preferable<br>
nucleophiles include anions of thiols or alcohols having as the counter ion an<br>
alkali or alkali earth metal such as sodium, lithium, potassium, magnesium or<br>
cesium.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates approaches to providing the amidine<br>
((R3R4N)CNR2) functionality of compounds of Formula / where X = O or S,<br>
and R1 = halo, alkyl, alkylthio, aralkylthio, arylthio, alkyloxy, aralkyloxy or<br>
aryloxy. Depending on the nature of the group W in 4, several methods may<br>
be employed in the transformation of W to (R3R4N)CNR2.<br>
When W in 4 is a cyano group (CN), primary amide (CONH2) or ester<br>
(CO2R9), direct conversion to an unsubstituted amidine 6 (i.e., Formula /<br>
where R2, R3, R4 = H) can be effected by treatment with a reagent consisting<br>
of a Lewis acid complexed to ammonia. This complex is produced by<br>
treatment of ammonia or an ammonium salt, preferably an ammonium halide<br>
and most preferably ammonium chloride or bromide, with an appropriate<br>
Lewis acid, preferably a trialkylaluminum and most preferably trimethyl- or<br>
triethylaluminum in a solvent inert to the Lewis acid employed. For example,<br>
when a trialkylaluminum Lewis acid is employed with an ammonium halide,<br>
reaction occurs with loss of one equivalent of alkane to produce the<br>
dialkylhaloaluminum complex of ammonia (see, for example, Sidler, D.R., et<br>
al., J. Org. Chem., 59:1231 (1994)). Examples of suitable solvents include<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, or mesitylene,<br>
preferably toluene, or halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane,<br>
chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. The amidination reaction is generally<br>
carried out at elevated temperatures, preferably 40-200°C, more preferably<br>
80-140 °C, and most preferably at the reflux temperature of a solvent in the<br>
range of 80-120 °C. When W is a cyano group (CN), direct conversion to a<br>
mono- or disubstituted amidine 6 is also possible by treatment with a reagent<br>
consisting of a Lewis acid, preferably a trialkylaluminum, complexed to a<br>
mono- or disubstituted amine H2NR3 or HNR-'R4 (Garigipati, R., Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 31: 1969 (1990)). Alternatively the same addition of a mono- or<br>
disubstituted amine may be catalyzed by a copper salt such as Cu(I) chloride<br>
(Rousselet, G., et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 34: 6395 (1993)).<br>
When W in 4 is a carboxyl group (CO2H), indirect conversion to an<br>
unsubstituted amidine 6 can be carried out by initial esterification to 5 by any<br>
of a number of well-known dehydrating agents (for example,<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) with an alcohol (R8OH). More preferably 5 can be<br>
made by initial formation of an. acid chloride by treatment of 4 with any of a<br>
number of anhydrides of HC1 and another acid, such as thionyl chloride,<br>
POCl3, PCl3, PCl5, or more preferably oxalyl chloride, with or without an<br>
added catalyst such as N,N-dimethylforrnamide (DMF), followed by the<br>
alcohol R8OH. Conversion to the unsubstituted amidine 6 (R2, R3, R4 = H)<br>
can be carried out by treatment with a. Lewis acid complexed to ammonia.<br>
Amidines 6 can also be produced indirectly by conversion of 4 (W =<br>
CN) to iminoethers 7 by exposure to a strong acid such as a hydrogen halide,<br>
HBF4 or other non-nucleophilic acid, preferably gaseous HCl in the presence<br>
of an alcohol R8OH (R8 = alkyl, branched alkyl or cycloalkyl, preferably Me<br>
or Et) and most preferably with the alcohol as solvent. Alternatively when W<br>
= CONH2, conversion to an iminoether can be carried out by treatment with a<br>
trialkyloxonium salt (Meerwein's salts). In either case, treatment of the<br>
iminoether with ammonia (R3, R4 = H) or a mono- or disubstituted amine<br>
(HNR3R4) provides the corresponding, unsubstituted or substituted amidines 6<br>
(i.e., via classical Pinner synthesis: Pinner, A., Die Iminoaether und ihre<br>
Derivate, Verlag R. Oppenheim, Berlin (1892)).<br>
Conversion to substituted amidine 6 (R2, R3 = H and, R4 = OH) can be<br>
achieved by refluxing in ethanol the unsubstituted amidine 6 (R2, R3, R4 = H),<br>
hydroxylamine, and a base, preferably triethylamixie.<br>
scheme 3<br>
Scheme 3 illustrates one approach to aryl thiols, which can be used in<br>
Scheme 1 when such aryl thiols are not commercially available. Starting with<br>
an aryl halide with sufficient stability to strong nucleophiles, the aryl halide<br>
can be reacted with an alkali earth metal in an inert ethereal solvent such as<br>
diethyl ether under reflux, yielding a reactive organometallic species.<br>
Preferred metals include lithium, magnesium, and sodium, while the halide<br>
can be an aryl iodide or bromide. Alternatively, the aryl-metal species can be<br>
generated through a metal-halogen exchange with another organometallic<br>
reagent at low temperature in am ethereal solvent. Useful organometallic<br>
reagents include any of the isomeric butyllithiums and isopropylmagnesium<br>
bromide or chloride. In this instance, the aryl halide must be an aryl bromide<br>
or iodide and stable to strong nucleophiles.<br>
The aryl-metal reagent may then be reacted with elemental sulfur to<br>
provide a mixture of the aryl thiol (12) and the disulfide oxidation products<br>
The disulfide can be reacted with a reducing agent such as sodium<br>
borohydride, dithiothreitol, or triphenylphosphine, to give the aryl thiol (12).<br>
scheme 4<br>
Scheme 4 illustrates another approach to aryl thiols, which can be used<br>
in Scheme 1 when such aryl thiols are not commercially available. An<br>
arylamine 13 can be converted to the diazonimn salt and reacted with O-<br>
ethylxanthic acid potassium salt (Aldrich Chemical Company) to give an O-<br>
ethyl-S-aryl dithiocarbonate. which can subsequently be hydrolyzed to the aryl<br>
thiol 15. In some cases hydrolysis can provide a mixture of the aryl thiol (15)<br>
and the disulfide oxidation products (14). The disulfide can be reacted with a<br>
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, dithiothreitol, or<br>
triphenylphosphine, to give the aryl thiol (15).<br>
scheme 5<br>
Scheme 5 illustrates a general approach to compounds of Formula I<br>
where X = O or S, and R1 == halo. The nitroheterocycle 3 obtained in the<br>
manner described in Scheme 1 is reduced to the aminoheterocycle 16.<br>
Appropriate reagents to effect reduction of the nitro functionality include<br>
hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum metal<br>
deposited on carbon or barium sulfate in any number of solvents such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, DMF, or THF. Tin (II) chloride may be<br>
employed as a reductant in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
Alternatively, metals such as zinc or iron (Stanetty, P. and Kremslehner, M..<br>
Heterocycles 48: 259 (1998)) may also be used. More preferably, titanium<br>
(III) chloride in HC1 (see Ho, Wong, Synthesis, 45 (1974)) can be used as the<br>
reducing reagent. The aminoheterocycle 16 can then be converted to the halide<br>
17 by diazotization. When X = C1 or Br, this reaction is carried out by<br>
treating the aminoheterocycle 16 with t-butyl nitrite and copper (II) chloride or<br>
bromide as described in the Sandmeyer reaction (see Doyle; Siegfried;<br>
Dellaria, J. Org. Chem. 42: 242(5 (1977)).<br>
Scheme 6A<br>
Scheme 6a illustrates approaches to providing the biaryl functionality<br>
present in compounds of Formula II, where R3 can be a substituted aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic ring (aryl or heteroaryl). Starting with either of two aryl<br>
bromides, the methyl carboxylate 18 or the Boc-amidine 20, a transition-metal<br>
catalyzed cross-coupling reaction can take place using an appropriately<br>
substituted arylboronic acid, arylzincate, or arylstannane under Suzuki<br>
(Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A., Chem. Rev. 95:2457 (1995)), Negishi (Negishi, E. et<br>
al., J. Org. Chem. 42:1821 (1977)), or Stille conditions (Stille, J. K. Angew.<br>
Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 25: 50S (1986), and references contained therein),<br>
respectively.<br>
The Stille-type cross-coupling reaction takes place under inert<br>
atmosphere between an arylstannane and an aryl halide mediated by a catalyst<br>
such as palladium tetrakis-triphenylphosphine. The reaction is usually<br>
performed at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 150 °C in an<br>
aprotic solvent of appropriate boiling point such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, or<br>
dimethylformamide. In some; cases, additives such as lithium chloride<br>
(Curran, D.P. et al., J. Org. Chem. 61:6480 (1996)) or copper iodide<br>
(Liebeskind, L. S.; Fengl, R. W., J. Org. Chem. .55:5359 (1990)) can facilitate<br>
the cross-coupling reaction.<br>
A more preferable cross-coupling reaction of aryl bromides 18 and 20<br>
takes place under Negishi conditions, utilizing an aryl zinc reagent. The aryl<br>
zinc reagent can be prepared by transmetalation of an aryl grignard or aryl<br>
lithium reagent with a zinc halide salt, or more preferably, directly prepared<br>
from an aryl halide and activated zinc (Reike, R.D., Tetrahedron 53:1925<br>
(1997). The cross-coupling reaction generally takes place at temperatures<br>
between 60 and 100 °C in THF or THF/polar aprotic co-solvent mixtures.<br>
Palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) is the most widely used catalyst,<br>
although new catalysts such as palladium di-tert-butylphosphine (Dai, C; Fu,<br>
G.C., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123:2719 (2001)) can offer enhanced reactivities.<br>
The most preferable and widely applicable biaryl-forming reaction<br>
conditions for aryl bromides 18 and 20 take place under Suzuki conditions.<br>
Many sets of reaction conditions can be employed to promote the Suzuki-type<br>
cross-coupling reactions. These include appropriate combinations of<br>
anhydrous or water-containing solvents, appropriate bases such as metal<br>
carbonates, phosphates, and fluorides, and the transition-metal catalyst. For<br>
the synthesis of biarylsulfones 21 and 23, the most universal reaction<br>
conditions consisted of reacting aryl bromide 18 or 20 with an arylboronic<br>
acid or an aryboronate ester (e.g. pinacolboronate) in a biphasic<br>
toluene/ethanol/aqueous sodium carbonate solvent system. Palladium tetrakis-<br>
triphenylphosphine is used as the catalyst under these aqueous conditions.<br>
Under anhydrous conditions, new catalysts such as palladium di-tert-<br>
butylphosphine (Littke, A.F. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122:4020 (2000)) and<br>
bis (o-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl) palladium (Wolfe, J.P. et al., J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 121: 9550 (1999)) can offer enhanced reactivity at lower catalyst<br>
loadings.<br>
Scheme 6b describes an alternate route to compounds of Formula II<br>
where R5 is an aryl, or heteroaryl. Boc-protected amidine 20 is converted to an<br>
organoboron or organostannane 66, which is then reacted with a suitable<br>
halide or trifiate in the presence of a palladium catalyst to give 21, which is<br>
converted to the amidine 22 as described in scheme 6a. The preferred method<br>
for the synthesis of 66 when E is a boron or tin species is to first treat 20 with<br>
a base such isopropylmagnesium chloride, followed by lithiation with a<br>
suitable reagent such as n-butyllithium, followed by reaction with an<br>
electrophile such as trimethyl borate or tributyltin chloride.<br>
Another approach to introduce heteroaromatics is to prepare 61. This is<br>
accomplished by treatment of the organolithium species, prepared as outlined<br>
above, with a suitable electrophile such as N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Conversion of 67 to 21 can then be accomplished using diamine reagents such<br>
as 1,2-phenyldiamine to give 2-substituted benzimidazoles or ammonium<br>
acetate and glyoxal to give 2-substituted imidazoles, which is converted to the<br>
amidine 22 as described in scheme 6a.<br>
scheme 6C<br>
Scheme 6c describes methods for the introduction of alkyl groups to<br>
the phenyl ring of Formula I. Compound 20 is treated with a base such as<br>
isopropylmagnesiurn chloride, followed by lithiation with a suitable reagent<br>
such as n-butyllithium., followed by reaction with electrophiles such as<br>
aldehydes and ketones to give 68 (Wakefield, B.J. The Chemistry of<br>
Organolithium Compounds; Pergamon: Oxford, 1974; Wakefield, B.J.<br>
Organolithium Methods; Academic: San Diego, 1990), which is converted to<br>
the amidine 22 as described in scheme 6a.<br>
Scheme 6d describes an approach to compounds of formula I, where<br>
the Ar residue is substituted with amines at the meta-position. Transition metal<br>
catalyzed coupling of the bromide 69 with amines is used to synthesize<br>
arylamine 70. Examples of suitable transition metal catalyst include<br>
palladium(0) or palladium(II) compounds such as Pd(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2),<br>
dipalladium tris(dibenzylidineacetone) (Pd2(dba)3),<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(O) (Ph3P)3Pd), nickel(II) bis( 1,5-<br>
cyclooctadiene) (Ni(COD)2), or (l,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenyl nickel<br>
dichloride, in the presence or absence of coordinating ligand and in the<br>
presence of a suitable base and solvent. Preferred catalyst include Pd(OAc)2<br>
and Pd2(dba)3. Examples of coordinating ligands include tri-t-butylphosphine,<br>
2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,1'-binaphthyl (BINAP), 2,2'-<br>
bis(ditolylphosphino)-l,l'binaphthyl (tol-BINAP), 1,1'-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF), bis(2-<br>
diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether(DPEphos), 2-(di-t-butylphosphino)biphenyl<br>
(DBPB), 2-(di-cyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl (DCPB), 2-<br>
dicyclohexylphosphino-2,-(N,N-dimethylamino)biphenyl (DCDMB).<br>
Preferred ligands for palladium-catalyzed reactions include BINAP, DBPB,<br>
DCPB, and DCDMB. Preferred ligands for nickel-catalyzed reactions include<br>
DPPF or 1,10-phenanthroline. Examples of suitable bases include sodium t-<br>
butoxiode, potassium t-butoxide, cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate,<br>
potassium phosphate or cesium fluoride, with sodium t-butoxide, potassium<br>
phosphate or cesium carbonate preferred depending on the other functionality<br>
present in 70 and the amine being coupled. Suitable solvents include aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, or xylenes; ethers such as<br>
dimethoxyethane (DME) or 1,4-dioxane; or amides such as N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, N,N-dimiethylacetamide or N-methylpyrrolidinone.<br>
Preferred solvents include toluene, DME and 1,4-dioxane. The coupling<br>
reaction may be carried out at a temperature of 20-160 C, preferably 20-100 C,<br>
and most preferably at the lowest possible temperature that provides reaction<br>
times of less than 24 hours. For representative methodologies, catalysts,<br>
examples of conditions and reviews of these types of palladium-catalyzed<br>
coupling reactions see: J.P. Wolfe, et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 31:805-18(1998),<br>
C.G. Frost, et al.., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans 1, 2615-23 (1998) and J.P.<br>
Wolfe, J. Org. Chem., 65:1158-74 (1998). For examples of nickel-catalyzed<br>
reactions see J.P. Wolfe and S.L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 119:6054-58<br>
(1997). The nitrile 70 can be converted to the BOC-protected amidine by<br>
treating with lithiated tert-butylcarbamate (Aldrich Chemical Company, WI,<br>
USA). The amidine 72 is obtained by treating 71 with TFA.<br>
After completion of the biaryl species, amidine 22 is completed either<br>
through amidination of the methyl carboxylate 23 (Scheme 2), or by<br>
deprotection of Boc-amidine 21 with trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid<br>
in an organic solvent such as dioxane.<br>
When not commercially available, arylboronic acids of formulas 25<br>
and 26, where Ar is phenyl, naphthyl, or heterocycle, any of which are<br>
optionally substituted, can be synthesized by the methods illustrated in<br>
Scheme 7. When Y is Br, I, or C1 and Ar is tolerant to strong basic and/or<br>
nucleophilic conditions, the preferred method involves lithium/halogen<br>
exchange with n-BuLi followed by treatment with trimethyl borate,<br>
triisopropyl borate, or triethyl borate to give compounds of formula 26 where<br>
R10 is Me, Et, iPr, or H. Alternatively, regioselective metalation of 24 can be<br>
directly achieved with n-BuLi or t-BuLi when Y is H and an ortho directing<br>
group is present in Ar. La such cases, treatment of the metalated species with<br>
trimethyl borate triisopropyl borate, or triethyl borate gives rise to compounds<br>
of formula 26 where R10 is Me, Et, iPr or H. Examples of ortho directing<br>
groups suitable for this transformation include but are not limited to<br>
OCH2OCH3, SO2NR2, CONR2, CONHR, NHCOR, NHCO2R, and CSNHR<br>
(Mark, R., et al., J. Org. Chem. 47: 2101 (1982); Townsend, C, et al.,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 3923 (1981)). When Ar contains functional groups that are<br>
sensitive to base and/or nucleophiles, conversion of 24, where Y is Br, I, Cl, or<br>
OTf to arylboronic acids of formula 25 can be effected using one of several<br>
methods involving palladium(O)-mediated boronation of arylhalides<br>
(Ishiyama, T., et al., J. Org. Chem. 60: 7508 (1995)). Examples of this<br>
transformation include but are not limited to treatment of 24 with: 1)<br>
Pd(PPh3)4, (PPh3)2Pda2, or PdCl2(dppf), pinacolborane, and Et3N in dioxane<br>
at 100 °C (Murata, M., et al., J. Org. Chem. 65:164 (2000)); 2) Pd(OAc)2, (2'-<br>
Dicyclohexylphosphanyl-biphenyl-2-yl)-dimethyl-amine,<br>
bis(pinacolato)diboron, and K3PO4 in toluene at 95 °C (Old, D.W., et al., J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 120:9722 (1998)); 3) PdCl2(dppf), bis(pinacolato)diboron,<br>
and KOAc in DMSO (Ishiyama, T., et al., J. Org. Chem. (50:7508 (1995)).<br>
Suitable reaction times for this transformation are 12-24 hr.<br>
Scheme 8 illustrates an alternate approach to compounds of Formula /<br>
where X = O or S, and R1 = halo, alkylthio, aralkylthio, arylthio, alkyloxy,<br>
aralkyloxy or aryloxy. A heterocycle 27 appropriately substituted with a<br>
leaving group L may be substituted with an anion of R1 to give intermediate<br>
28. When L = halo, the halide can be left alone to give R1 = halo. The amine<br>
29 is then derived from reduction of the nitro group. Appropriate reagents to<br>
effect reduction of the nitro functionality include hydrogen gas in the presence<br>
of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum metal deposited on carbon or<br>
barium sulfate in any number of solvents such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl<br>
acetate, DMF, or THF. More preferably, tin (II) chloride may be employed as<br>
a reductant in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Alternatively, metals<br>
such as zinc or iron (Stanetty, P. and Kremslehner, M., Heterocycles 48: 259<br>
(1998)) may also be used. When R1 is halo, titanium (HI) chloride in HC1 (see<br>
Eo, Wong, Synthesis 45 (1974)) is the preferred reducing reagent. The amine<br>
29 can then be converted to the sulfonyl chloride 30 by diazotization in the<br>
presence of sulfur dioxide and copper (II) chloride (Ramsay, G. C. et al., J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 93:1166-1171 (1971), European Patent EP 983982). The<br>
sulfonyl chloride 30 can then be treated with sodium sulfite and sodium<br>
bicarbonate to afford the sodium sulfinate 31 (Field L. and Clark. R. D.,<br>
Organic Synthesis Collective Vol. IV, 674-677, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.<br>
1963). The sulfinate 31 can be converted to sulfone 32 by reacting the<br>
sulfinate 31 with an alkyl or aryl group appropriately substituted with a<br>
leaving group in a solvent such as ethanol (Field L. and Clark. R. D., Organic<br>
Synthesis Collective Vol. IV, 674-677, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1963).<br>
Scheme 9 illustrates a specific example of the method shown in<br>
Scheme 8. The sulfinate 33 can be obtained by treating 4-nitro-5-bromo-<br>
thiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (DelPErba, C. and Spinelli, D.,<br>
Tetrahedron 21: 1061 (1965); Dell'Erba, C. et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans<br>
2, 1779 (1989)) according to scheme 8. The sulfinate 33, can be treated with<br>
34 (Hazelton, C. J. et al., Tetrahedron, 51:5591 (1995)) in a solvent such as<br>
aqueous ethanol with acetic acid as catalyst to give the sulfone 35. Sulfone 35<br>
is treated with sodium dithionite in aqueous ethanol to afford 36 (Hazelton, C.<br>
J. et al., Tetrahedron, 51:5591 (1995)), which can be cross-coupled to an aryl<br>
residue using the methods described in Scheme 6 to give compounds of<br>
formula 37. Both compound 36 and 37 can be treated with hot formic acid to<br>
give compounds 42 and 38 respectively. Benzimidazoles 38 and 42 can then<br>
be alkylated to give 39-41 and 43-44 respectively. These esters can be<br>
converted to their amidines by the methods described in Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 9b illustrates approaches to 1-alkyl-5-sulfonyl-benzimidazoles<br>
of compounds of Formula X, where R = H, halo, alkyl, alkyloxy, and Ri=<br>
alkyl or aryl. Appropriately substituted sulfinate can be prepared from the<br>
corresponding sulfonyl chloride in a manner similar to that described in<br>
scheme 11. Reaction of the appropriately substituted arylsulfinate 74 with the<br>
bromo-nitro-thiophene, 1 yields a mixture of mono- and bis-sulfone adducts.<br>
Thiomethoxide addition at—78 °C chemoselectively occurs at the 5-position of<br>
the thiophene for both adducts, giving the intermediate 75. The aniline 75 is<br>
converted to the arylhalide 76 under Sandmeyer diazotization conditions<br>
(Doyle, M. P. et al.. J. Org. Chem. 42, 2426 (1977)). Heating this halo-<br>
nitroarene with an amine or arylamine at 60-80 °C in the presence of a base<br>
(NaOAc or DIEA) yields the substituted aniline 77. Reduction of the nitro<br>
group (e.g. Fe/AcOH in ethanol) followed by heating in formic acid gives the<br>
benzimidazole 78, which can be converted to the amidine 79 as described in<br>
Scheme 2.<br>
The synthesis of compounds of formulas 48 and 49, having two meta-<br>
substitutions on the phenyl ring with respect to the sulfone are described in<br>
Scheme 10. The tert-butyl phenol ether in compound 45 can be deprotected<br>
using a strong acid treatment such as TFA or HC1 in DCM or dioxane,<br>
respectively. The free phenol as in compound 46 can be alkylated under<br>
standard conditions with alkyl halide and a base, preferably CS2CO3 in<br>
acetone, to furnish compounds described by formula 47. Examples of<br>
alkylating agents (R11) include but are not limited to allyl bromide, benzyl<br>
bromide, methyl iodide, 2-bromoacetate, and 2-bromoacetamide. The<br>
carboxylic acid ester in formula 47 can be directly converted to the amidine or<br>
a masked amidine as described in Scheme 2 to give compounds of formula 48.<br>
Alternatively, 47 can be cross-coupled with a variety of arylboronic acids and<br>
heterocyclic boronic acids as shown in Scheme 6, followed by amidination as<br>
previously described to afford compounds contained in formula 49.<br>
Scheme 11 illustrates yet another approach to compounds of Formula I<br>
where X = O or S, R1 = halo, alkylthio. aralkylthio, arylthio, alkyloxy,<br>
aralkyloxy or aryloxy. A sulfonyl chloride 50, where Ar is aryl or heteroaryl,<br>
is treated with sodium sulfite and sodium bicarbonate to afford the sodium<br>
sulfinate 51 (Field L. and Clark. R. D., Organic Synthesis Collective Vol. IV,<br>
pp. 674-677, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (1963)). The sulfinate 51 can be<br>
converted to sulfone 3 by reacting the sulfinate 51 with 1. The sulfone 3 can<br>
then be treated as described in scheme 1 to give intermediate 4, which can be<br>
converted to an amidine by the methods described in scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 12 illustrates a specific example of the method shown in<br>
scheme 11. Pyridylsulfonylchloridie (Aldrich), 52 is converted to the sulfinic<br>
acid and reacted with thiophene ester 54 to give the sulfone, 55. The sulfone<br>
(55) is then treated as described in scheme 1 to give the intermediate 56.<br>
Intermediate 56 can be treated with ammonia or zinc dust in acetic acid<br>
(Krutosikova, A.; Sleziak, R. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. (1996) 61,<br>
1627-1636) to give compounds 58 or 59 respectively. The amide 58 can be<br>
converted to the biaryl compound 60 using methods described in scheme 6.<br>
Compounds 56, 58, 59, and 60 can be converted to the corresponding<br>
amidines 57, 61, 62, and 63 respectively, as described in scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 13 illustrates a general route to compounds of formula I where<br>
Ar is substituted 3-pyridyl (when A = N) and compounds of formula II where<br>
the phenylsulfone moiety has an amino group at the 4-position (A = N, C).<br>
The sulfone 56 is prepared as described in scheme 12 and then treated as<br>
described in scheme 1 to give the corresponding amidine, which is BOC-<br>
protected to give intermediate 64. The C1 group in intermediate 64 can be<br>
displaced with an amine to give a substituted aminopyridine, which upon<br>
treatment with trifluoroacetic acid gives compound 65. Intermediate 56 can be<br>
treated with Zn dust (Krutosikova, A.; Sleziak, R. Collect. Czech. Chem.<br>
Commun. (1996) 61, 1627-1636) to give the dehalogentaed product 59, which<br>
can also be converted to the amidine 63. The halogen Y in intermediate 56<br>
(when A = N or C) can also be substituted with ammonia to give 58, which<br>
can be converted to the amidine 62. Alternatively, 58 can be converted to the<br>
biaryl compound 60 using methods described in scheme 6.<br>
Scheme 14 illustrates this general approach to the synthesis of<br>
compounds of formula n, where R5 is 2-aminophenyl or 2-amino-4-pyridyl<br>
and the amino groups are further substituted. The Biaryl-intermediate 80 can<br>
be prepared either by treating 20 with an appropriately substituted<br>
arylboronate or boronic acid using conditions similar that described in scheme<br>
6a or by treating 66 with an appropriately substituted arylhalide or triflate<br>
using conditions similar to that described in scheme 6b. Intermediate 2 can be<br>
converted to the corresponding substituted ureas 81 using conditions such as<br>
p-nitrophenylchloroformate in the presence of a base such as pyridine,<br>
followed by addition of a substituted amine, followed by treatment with an<br>
acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. In an alternative approach intermediate 80<br>
can be treated with reagents such as substituted isocyanates in the presence of<br>
a base such as triethylamine, followed by treatment with an acid such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid to give the corresponding substituted ureas 81. The<br>
intermediate 2 can also be converted to the corresponding amides 82 using<br>
reagents such as substituted acids in the presence of coupling reagents such as<br>
EDCI and HOBt, followed by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic<br>
acid. The intermediate 80 can also be converted to the corresponding amides<br>
or sulfonamides 82 by treating with acid chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides,<br>
anhydrides, or activated esters in the presence of a base such as triethylamine,<br>
followed by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Scheme 15 illustrates a general approach to the synthesis of<br>
compounds of formula II, where R5 is 2,4-diaininophenyl and the amino<br>
groups are further substituted. Intermediate 83 can be synthesized in a manner<br>
similar to that described in scheme 14. When R23 is a masked amine such as<br>
nitro. or trimethylsilylethyl carbamate (Teoc), the ortho-aniline may be<br>
functionalized with a variety of reagents such as acid chlorides, sulfonyl<br>
chlorides, activated carboxylic esters, and isocyanates to give compound 84.<br>
When R" of compound 84 is a nitro-group it can be reduced to an amino-<br>
group under mild conditions using iron powder in ethanolic aqueous<br>
ammonium chloride (R1 = NO2) and further reacted with reagents such as acid<br>
chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, activated carboxylic esters, isocyanates,<br>
guanidinylating reagents, alkyl halides, and aldehydes (reductive animation) to<br>
give compound 86. When R23 is a protected aniline it can be deprotected. For<br>
example a Teoc group is removed by treatment with a fluoride anion source<br>
such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF to give compound 85. This can<br>
be further functionalized in the manner described above.<br>
Scheme 16 illustrates approaches to providing the arylguanidine<br>
functionality of compounds of Formula II where R5 is a substituted phenyl<br>
group with a 4-araino functionality. Depending on the nature of the group R,<br>
several methods may be employed in the guandinylation of the aniline 87 to<br>
compounds 89, 90 or 92. When R1 is H or alkyl, unsubstituted or N,N'-bis-<br>
substituted arylguanidines 90, can be synthesized by the reaction of the aniline<br>
with a diprotected S-alkyl isothiourea (e.g. bis-Boc-SMe-isothiourea). This<br>
reaction can generally be promoted by either of two reaction conditions; 1) a<br>
mercury salt (e.g. HgCl2) with triethylamine at 50 °C [WO-99/206208] or 2)<br>
acetic acid in methanol at 40 °C [Tetrahedron Lett., 43, 6563-6566 (2000)].<br>
When R' is a strong electron-withdrawing group (e.g. nitro), or contains other<br>
acid-sensitive functionality, the mercury reagent is preferred. When R31 is, or,<br>
contains an amino-group, selective guanidinylation at the 4-amino group can<br>
be achieved using the acetic acid/methanol conditions. Monosubstituted N'-<br>
arylguanidines 89 can be synthesized by reaction of the aniline (R1 =: H, alkyl)<br>
with a substituted diprotected S-alkyl isothiourea (e.g. alkylN(Boc)-<br>
C(SMe)=NBoc). The acetic acid in methanol reaction condition is the method<br>
of choice for this transformation. The monoalkyl isothiourea starting materials<br>
can be synthesized via alkylation of the bis-Boc-SMe-isothiourea with a<br>
hydride base/alkyl halide [J. Med. Chem., 36, 2956-2963 (1993)] or<br>
Mitsunobu reaction [J. Med. Chem., 43, 2362-2370 (2000)}.<br>
Alternatively, arylguanidines can be prepared from corresponding<br>
thiourea intermediates 91 and 94. Preparation of 91 is achieved by reacting the<br>
aniline scaffold with an isothiocyanate. Alternatively, the aniline scaffold may<br>
be converted to the isothiocyanate [J. Org. Chem., 51, 2613-2615 (1986)]<br>
followed by reaction with an alkylamine, aniline, hydrazide, or alkoxylamine<br>
to give 94. The thiourea may then be converted to the guanidine using<br>
mercuric oxide in the presence of excess amine (e.g. ammonia, methylamine,<br>
etc.) [J. Chem. Soc, 475, 479 (1949)].<br>
Scheme 17 illustrates the general approach to the synthesis of<br>
compounds of formula II, represented by examples 213-214. The alcohol 95<br>
can be converted to the corresponding mesyiate 98 in the presence of a<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride and a base such as triethylamine, in a solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane. Mesyiate 98 can be treated with a variety of substituted<br>
nucleophiles in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a solvent such<br>
as dichloromethane, followed by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic<br>
acid to give the corresponding product 99. Alternatively, compound 95 can be<br>
converted to the corresponding aldehyde 96 in the presence of an oxidizing<br>
agent such as manganese dioxide. Aldehyde 96 can then be treated with a<br>
variety of phosphorus ylides to give the corresponding olefin, (see Paterson, I.,<br>
et al., Org. Lett. 5(I):35-38 (2003)), followed by treatment with an acid such<br>
as trifluoroacetic acid to give compound 100. For example, aldehyde 96 is<br>
treated with (diethoxy-phosphorylmethyl)-phosphonic acid diethyl ester in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, followed by treatment with trimethylsilyl iodide and a solvent<br>

The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method<br>
and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and<br>
adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered<br>
and obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
a) 4-Methoxymethoxy-biphenyl<br>
To an oven-dried flask containing a stirbar was added 4-<br>
hydroxybiphenyl (1.70 g, 10 mmol), toluenesulfonic acid (190 mg, 1.1 mmol),<br>
dichloromethane (DCM, 5 mL), and dimethoxypropane (5 mL)- The solution<br>
was heated and stirred at 40 °C for 48 h. Solid NaHCO3 (200 mg) was added,<br>
followed by EtOAc (100 mL) and NaOH (1N, 20 mL). The layers were<br>
separated and the organic layer was further extracted with NaOH (1N, 12 x 20<br>
ml), brine (30 mL), and was dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of the<br>
solvents in vacuo yielded the title compound (385 mg, 18%) which was used<br>
without further purification. 1H-NMR (CDCl3); d 7.56 (m, 4H), 7.44 (m, 2H),<br>
7.34 (m, 1H), 7.14 (m, 2H), 5.24 (s, 2H), 3.54 (s, 3H).<br>
b) 4-Methoxymethoxy-biphenyl-3-yl-boronic acid<br>
Butyllithium (2.5M, 1.44 mL, 3.6 mmol) was added over 5 min to a<br>
stirred solution of 4-methoxymethoxy-biphenyl (from the previous step 385<br>
mg, 1.8 mmol) in Et2O (18 mL) at 0 °C. The reaction was allowed to warm to<br>
rt and stirred for 2 h. The solution was cooled to -78 °C and trimethylborate<br>
(1.23 mL, 10.8 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was quickly added. The reaction<br>
wanned to rt over 1 h and was stirred 1 h at rt, during which it became cloudy<br>
and a gelatin-like residue appeared. EtOAc (70 mL) and water (30 mL) were<br>
added along with HC1 (IN, 1 mL). The biphasic solution was stirred for 10<br>
min and the layers were separated. The organic layer was further extracted<br>
with HC1 (0.1N, 3 x 20 mL)., brine (60 mL), and was dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. Removal of the solvents in vacuo followed by chromatography of the<br>
residue (20-40% EtOAc in hexaries) yielded the title compound (135 mg,<br>
29%) as a light-brown solid. The title compound exists as a mixture of<br>
boronic acids and anhydrides in CDCl3, therefore the reported NMR signals<br>
represent pairs or groups of related signals. 1H-NMR (CDCl3): d 8.07 (d, 1H,<br>

sparged with argon for 10 min, and Pd(PPh3)4 (29.4 mg, 0.025 mmol) was<br>
added. The biphasic solution was vigorously stirred under inert atmosphere at<br>
80 °C for 16 h, then was cooled to rt. EtOAc (20 mL) and water (10 mL) were<br>
added and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with<br>
saturated NaHCO;, (2 x 10 mL), brine (10 mL) and was dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. Removal of the solvents in vacuo followed by preparative TLC (25%<br>
EtOAc in hexanes) of the residue yielded the title compound (15 mg, 24%) as<br>
a light-yellow glass. 1H-NMR (CDCl3): 6 8.27 (t, 1H, J = 1.9), 7.99 (ddd, 1H,<br>

Examples 41-107<br>
The compounds in examples 41 to 107 (see table 1) were synthesized<br>
in a parallel fashion as follows: To dry 2-dram vials, each fitted with a stir bar<br>
and a Teflon®-lined screw cap was added {[4-(3-bromo-benzenesulfonyl)-5-<br>
methylsulfanyl-thiophen-2-yr|-imino-methyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester<br>
(0.1 mrnol, as prepared in Example 27, step c), the appropriate boronic acid<br>
(0.2 mrnol), and tetrakis(triphenylphosine)palladium(0) (0.025 mmol). Each<br>
vial was twice treated with an argon purge/evacuation cycle and then charged<br>
with a mixture of toluene/EtOH (2:1, 1.2 mL) and 2 M Na2CO3 (0.4 mL) via a<br>
syringe. The vials were placed in an oil bath at 80 °C and stirred overnight. To<br>
the cooled reaction mixtures was added EtOAc (4 mL), the organic layer was<br>
filtered (1-g silica SPE column), and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. The<br>
resulting residue was purified using preparative TLC (SiO2) to afford the Boc-<br>
protected amidine product. After treatment of this material with trifluoroacetic<br>
acid (50% in DCM) for 1 hr at rt, the solvents were removed in vacuo and the<br>
residue was purified using C18;-HPLC (typical HPLC method: 10% to 80 %<br>
CH3CN in H2O (0.1% TFA) over 25 min) to afford the desired compound.<br>
Example 94 was prepared in an identical fashion except for removal of the<br>
Boc protecting group which was achieved by treatment with 4 N HCl in<br>
dioxane for 1 hr at it. This was found to minimize side reactions involving the<br>
vinylic group (see Example 32).<br>

In vitro Inhibition of C1s<br>
Reagents: All buffer salts were obtained from Sigma Chemical<br>
Company (St. Louis, MO), and were of the highest purity available. DTNB<br>
was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Z-Gly-Arg-S-Bzl was purchased<br>
from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Activated human C1s was<br>
purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).<br>
K, Determinations: All assays are based on the ability of the test<br>
compound to inhibit the C1s-catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate Z-Gly-Arg-<br>
S-Bzl, which is observed via a secondary reaction with 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-<br>
nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), In a typical K, determination, substrate is<br>
prepared in DMSO, and diluted into an assay buffer consisting of 50 mM<br>
HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% n-octyl-b-D-glucopyranoside.<br>
Substrate solutions were prepared at a concentration of 45 uM (Km = 190 uM)<br>
with DTNB at a concentration of 200 uM in assay buffer. Test compounds are<br>
prepared as a 10 uM solution in DMSO. Dilutions are prepared in DMSO<br>
yielding 7 final concentrations encompassing a 700-fold concentration range.<br>
Purified activated C1s was diluted into assay buffer for a working<br>
concentration of 66 nM.<br>
In a typical Ki determination, into each well of a 96-well plate is<br>
pipetted 280 µL of substrate solution, 10 µL of test compound solution, and<br>
the plate allowed to thermally equilibrate at 37°C for 15 minutes. Reactions<br>
were initiated by the addition of a 10 µL aliquot of the enzyme, and the<br>
absorbance increase at 405 nm is continuously recorded for 15 minutes in a<br>
Molecular Devices plate reader. Final DMSO concentration was 4.3%. Final<br>
reagent concentrations were: [Cls] = 2.3 nM, [Z-Gly-Arg-S-Bzl] = 45 µM,<br>
[DTNB] = 200 µM. The ratio of the velocity (rate of change in absorbance as<br>
a function of time) for a sample containing no test compound is divided by the<br>
velocity of a sample containing test compound, and is plotted as a function of<br>
test compound concentration. The data are fit to a linear regression, and the<br>
value of the slope of the line: calculated. The inverse of the slope is the<br>
experimentally determined Ki value.<br>
