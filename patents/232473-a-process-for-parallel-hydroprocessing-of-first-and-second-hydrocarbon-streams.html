				<td>The present invention relates to a process for parallel hydroprocessing of first and second hydrocarbon streams .<br>
This invention relates to hydroprocessing of hydrocarbon streams, including hydrocracking and hydrotreating of such streams in a petroleum refinery or chemical plant.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Hydrocarbon-based petroleum and synthetic oils derive from a variety of ultimate sources including crude oil, tar sands, shale oil, and liquefied coal-based compositions. Such oils are processed in refineries and chemical plants to remove undesired components and to chemically alter the hydrocarbon-based oils to manufacture streams having a higher value than the streams that either occur naturally or are delivered to processing equipment. Two such processes used in petroleum refineries are hydrotreating and hydrocracking.<br>
A hydrotreating process typically reacts hydrogen, in the presence of a catalyst, with a hydrocarbon-based oil to convert organic sulfur and nitrogen compounds to hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, respectively, which can be relatively easily removed from the hydrocarbon-based oil stream. Various other reactions occur concurrently in the same reaction vessel including hydrogenation.<br>
A hydrocracking process is similarly carried out in the presence of a catalyst, but typically at more severe conditions than used in hydrotreating. In particular, hydrocracking is typically carried out at a significantly higher pressure than hydrotreating and otherwise differs from hydrotreating in that an objective of hydrocracking is to break large molecules into smaller ones having a higher value.<br>
Hydrogen is used in both processes, and since the processing units are operated at relatively high pressures, the capital and operating costs for compression are significant. Various inventions have been disclosed pertaining to the configuration of the processing units with respect to the hydrogen system, frequently with the objective of lowering<br><br>
capital and operating costs, while increasing the flexibility of the processing equipment.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,592,757 Issued to Baral teaches a hydrofiner (essentially the same as a hydrotreater) operating in series with a hydrocracker, with a fraction of the product fed to a hydrogenator. A gas oil feed is fed with both make-up and recycle hydrogen to a hydrofiner. A recycle stream and additional recycle hydrogen are added to the hydrofiner product stream, and the mixture is fed to a hydrocracker. The hydrocracker product stream is cooled and separated into a vapor and a liquid stream. The vapor stream is passed to a recycle hydrogen compressor for recycle to the hydrofiner. The liquid stream is fractionated into top, mid, and bottom streams. The bottom stream is recycled to the hydrocracker. The mid stream is mixed with hydrogen from a make-up hydrogen compressor and directed to a hydrogenator. Hydrogen recovered from the hydrogenator is compressed in a stage of the make-up hydrogen compressor and directed to the hydrofiner.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,114,562 issued to Haun et al. teaches a two-<br>
stage hydrodesulfurization (essentially the same as a hydrotreatment) and hydrogenation process for distillate hydrocarbons. Two separate reaction zones are employed in series, a first for hydrodesulfurization<br>
and a second for hydrogenation. A feed is mixed with a recycled hydrogen and fed to a desulfurization reactor. Hydrogen sulfide is stripped from the desulfurization reactor product by a countercurrent flow of hydrogen. The liquid product stream from this stripping operation is mixed with relatively clean recycled hydrogen and the mixture fed to a hydrogenation reaction zone. Hydrogen is recovered from the hydrogenation reactor and recycled as a split stream to both the desulfurization reactor and the hydrogenation reactor. The hydrogen from the stripping operation is passed through a separator, mixed with the portion of the recycled hydrogen directed to the hydrogenation<br><br>
reactor, compressed, passed through a treating step, and recycled to the hydrogenation reactor. Thus, the hydrocarbon feed stream passes in series through the desulfurization and hydrogenation reactors, while relatively low pressure hydrogen is provided for the desulfurization step and relatively high pressure hydrogen is provided for the hydrogenation step.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,403,469 issued to Vauk et al. teaches a process for producing fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) feed and middle distillate. Separate feed streams from a vacuum tower are processed in parallel by a hydrocracker and a hydrotreater, a relatively lighter feed stream in the hydrocracker and a relatively heavier feed stream in the hydrotreater. A common source of recycled and make-up hydrogen is fed in parallel to the hydrocracking and hydrotreating steps. The product streams from the hydrocracking and hydrotreating steps are separated into liquid and vapor streams in a common separator. Consequently, the hydrocracking and hydrotreating steps operate at the same pressure. This requires either the hydrotreating step to operate at a higher than optimum pressure and/or the hydrocracking step to operate at a lower than optimum pressure, since typically a hydrocracker is operated at a significantly higher pressure than a hydrotreater. With make-up hydrogen added to maintain pressure, recycle hydrogen is recycled from the common separator to a recycle gas compressor, which compresses the gas before parallel delivery to both the hydrocracker and the hydrotreater. In an alternative embodiment, the feed to the hydrocracker is a recycle stream from a fractionator that separates the combined product from the hydrotreater and the hydrocracker.<br>
Although there have been many advances in this art, there remains a need for a parallel hydroprocessing configuration, where parallel reactors operate at different hydrogen partial pressures, but yet,<br><br>
capital and utility costs for compression are reduced relative to conventional configurations.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
Parallel hydroprocessing reactor configurations using a series hydrogen recycle loop are illustrated in Figs. 1-3. The term "hydrocarbon" as used herein refers broadly to any compound containing both hydrogen and carbon and includes liquid, vapor and combined liquid/vapor streams containing greater than about 90 weight percent hydrogen and carbon, calculated as the elements.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, in a parallel hydroprocessing process 10, a first hydrocarbon feedstock 12 and a hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream 14 are introduced to a first catalytic reactor zone 15. A first reactor effluent stream 16 is produced in the first catalytic reactor zone 15 and fed to a first separator 17. The first separator 17 separates the first reactor effluent stream 16 into a vapor first hydrogen-rich gas stream 18 and a liquid first hydroprocessed product stream 19.<br>
The first hydrogen-rich gas stream 18 and a second hydrocarbon feedstock 20 are fed to a second catalytic reactor zone 21. A second reactor effluent stream 22 is produced in the second catalytic reactor zone 21 and fed to a second separator 23. The second separator 23 separates the second reactor effluent stream 22 into a vapor second hydrogen-rich gas stream 24 and a liquid second hydroprocessed product stream 26.<br>
The second hydrogen-rich gas stream 24 is compressed in a compressor 27 and a make-up hydrogen stream 28 is added to form the hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream 14 that is fed to the first catalytic reactor zone 15. Alternatively, the make-up hydrogen stream 28 can be added to the second hydrogen-rich gas stream 24 on the suction side of the compressor 27 to form the hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream 14.<br>
The first and second catalytic reactor zones 15 and 21 can be any hydroprocessing reactor conventionally used in refinery and chemical<br><br>
plant units, such as, for example, hydrotreating (including hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation), hydrocracking, hydrogenation, isomerization, aromatics saturation, dewaxing, and like reactors. Hydrocarbon compounds that can be converted in the first and second catalytic reactor zones 15 and 21 include organosulfur, organonitrogen, and organometallic compounds, and olefinic, aromatic, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, acetylenic, alkaryl and arylalkyl aromatic compounds and derivatives thereof. If desired, the reactor zones 15 and 21 can comprise a plurality of stages or beds with interstage injection of hydrogen-rich gas from lines 14 and 18, respectively.<br>
The two-stage hydroprocessing reaction scheme with series recycle gas flow illustrated generally in Fig. 1 has a number of uses and advantages. The first catalytic reactor zone 15 and the second catalytic reactor zone 21 operate at different hydrogen partial pressures, since hydrogen-rich gas flows in series from the higher-pressure first catalytic reactor zone 15 to the lower-pressure second catalytic reactor zone 21. This provides flexibility to match hydrocarbon feedstocks with an appropriate hydrogen partial pressure.<br>
Proper balancing of hydrocarbon feedstocks with proper hydrogen partial pressures provides efficient consumption of hydrogen to yield desired products. The relative flow rates of the hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream 14 and the first hydrogen-rich gas stream 18 can be balanced to reduce recycle gas rates.<br>
The series arrangement of hydrogen flow reduces compressor investment capital requirements, while at the same time reducing compressor operating costs. A single compressor can provide hydrogen to the first catalytic reactor zone at a relatively higher pressure and higher purity and to the second catalytic reactor zone at a relatively lower pressure and lower purity, without, for example, an inefficient letdown in pressure across a control valve.<br><br>
Operating conditions can be varied to suit the feedstocks. The optimum conditions will depend on the feedstock and the desired product attributes. Key operating parameters of the reactors include pressure, temperature, liquid hourly space velocity and relative flow rates of the hydrogen and hydrocarbon streams. With reference to Fig. 1, the first and second catalytic reactor zones 15 and 21 are typically operated between 50 and 4000 psig; 100 and 1000°F; 0.05 to 25 volume/volume-hr; and 500 to 15,000 scf hydrogen/bbl hydrocarbon feed. The hydrogen purity in the hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream 14 is typically greater than 65 volume percent, and in the first hydrogen-rich gas stream 18, the hydrogen purity is typically greater than 50 volume percent.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. In a parallel hydroprocessing process 10a, a feed 32, such as atmospheric residuum from crude oil distillation, is fed to a vacuum tower 33, where it is fractionated into a light vacuum gas oil fraction 34 and a heavy vacuum gas oil fraction 36. The light vacuum gas oil fraction 34 typically has an ASTM 95 % off point below about 950 0 F, and the heavy vacuum gas oil fraction 36 typically has an ASTM 5 % off point above about 750 ° F.<br>
The light vacuum gas oil fraction 34 and a recycle hydrogen stream 38 are fed to a hydrocracker 39 to produce a hydrocracker effluent stream 40, which is fed to a hydrocracker effluent separator 41. The hydrocracker effluent stream 40 is separated into a hydrocracker product stream 42 and a hydrocracker effluent hydrogen stream 44. The hydrocracker effluent hydrogen stream 44 is fed along with the heavy vacuum gas oil fraction 36 to a hydrotreater 45 to produce a hydrotreater effluent stream 46, which is fed to a hydrotreater effluent separator 47. The hydrotreater effluent stream 46 is separated into a hydrotreater product stream 48 and a hydrotreater effluent hydrogen stream 50. A<br><br>
make-up hydrogen stream 52 is added to the hydrotreater efnuent hydrogen stream 50 and compressed in compressor 53 to form the recycle hydrogen stream 38 for recycle to the hydrocracker 39. A pressure controller (not shown) can be used to add the make-up hydrogen stream 52. Alternatively, if the make-up hydrogen stream 52 is available at a sufficiently high pressure, then it can be added to the hydrotreater effluent hydrogen stream 50 on the discharge side of the compressor 53. In either case, hydrogen purity can be monitored in the recycle hydrogen stream 38 to control hydrogen partial pressure and relative flow rates of the hydrogen and hydrocarbon streams.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, the hydrocracker 39 and the hydrotreater 45 are typically operated between 200 and 4000 psig; 500 and 900°F; 0.05 to 10 volume/volume-hr; and 500 to 15,000 scf hydrogen/bbl hydrocarbon feed. The hydrogen purity in the recycle hydrogen stream 38 is typically greater than 65 volume percent, and in the hydrocracker effluent hydrogen stream 44, the hydrogen purity is typically greater than 50 volume percent.<br>
Preferably, the hydrocracker 39 is operated between 700 and 2,500 psig; 600 to 850°F; 0.1 to 5 volume/volume-hr; and 1,000 to 10,000 scf hydrogen/bbl hydrocarbon feed, and the hydrotreater 45 is operated between 300 and 1,500 psig; 500 to 800 ° F; 0.1 to 5 volume/volume-hr; and 1,000 to 10,000 scf hydrogen/bbl hydrocarbon feed.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, an alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown. In a parallel hydroprocessing process 10b, a recycle feed stream 56 and a recycle hydrogen stream 58 are fed to a hydrocracker 59 to produce a hydrocracker effluent stream 60, which is fed to a hydrocracker effluent separator 61. The hydrocracker effluent stream 60 is separated into a hydrocracker product stream 62 and a hydrocracker effluent hydrogen stream 64. The hydrocracker effluent<br><br>
hydrogen stream 64 and a fresh feed stream 66, such as, for example, an atmospheric residuum from crude oil distillation or a vacuum gas oil, are fed to a hydrotreater 68 to produce a hydrotreater effluent stream 70, which is fed to a hydrotreater effluent separator 71. The hydrotreater effluent stream 70 is separated into a hydrotreater product stream 72 and a hydrotreater effluent hydrogen stream 74. A make-up hydrogen stream 76 is added to the hydrotreater effluent hydrogen stream 74 and compressed in a compressor 78 to form the recycle hydrogen stream 58 for recycle to the hydrocracker 59. Alternatively, if the make-up hydrogen stream 76 is available at a sufficiently high pressure, then it can be added to the hydrotreater effluent hydrogen stream 74 on the discharge side of the compressor 78.<br>
The hydrotreater product stream 72 and the hydrocracker product stream 62 are fed in combination to a fractionator 80. The fractionator 80 separates its feed into at least two fractions, one of the fractions being the recycle feed stream 56 that was fed to the hydrocracker 59. Other fractions can be drawn from the fractionator 80 as product streams. For example, a middle distillate product stream 82, such as jet or diesel fuel and a bottom product stream 84 can be drawn from the fractionator. The bottom product stream 84 is typically suitable for feed to a fluid catalytic cracking unit or can also be recycled for further conversion on the hydrocracker 59.<br>
The operating conditions for the hydrocracker and hydrotreater in Fig. 3 are approximately equivalent to the operating conditions provided with reference to Fig. 2. The processing configuration in Fig. 3 is advantageous in that the recycle configuration provides a higher yield of middle distillates than does once-through processing.<br><br>
Example<br>
A study was conducted comparing computer-based simulations of the parallel hydrocracking and hydrotreating of vacuum gas oils in parallel reactor stages. The first design comprises the use of parallel hydrogen recycle, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,403,469 issued to Vauk et al., and the second design comprises the use of series hydrogen recycle as shown in Fig. 1 of the present invention. Calculations were performed based on hydrocracking 15,000 barrels per day of vacuum gas oil and hydrotreating 30,000 barrels per day of vacuum gas oil under commercially viable pressure levels. As can be seen in the Table below, both designs deliver equivalent hydrogen-to-oil ratios at the reactor inlets. The design based on the present invention results in substantially lower total gas circulation (100,085 SCFM versus 212,885 SCFM) and lower compression costs (3,289 HP versus 3,923 HP), even though the total pressure drop requirement is higher (425 psi versus 255 psi). The design based on the present invention also results in lower reactor design pressure for the hydrotreater reactor stage (1275 psi versus 1500 psi), allowing for decreased investment and installation cost for the facilities and also for minimized hydrogen consumption.<br>
The results of the study are summarized in the table below.<br><br>
