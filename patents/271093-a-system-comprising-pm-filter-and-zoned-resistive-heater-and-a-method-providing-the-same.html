STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] This disclosure was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this disclosure.<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/972,946, filed on September 17, 2007. This<br>
application is related to United States Patent Application Nos. xx/xxx,xxx filed on<br>
	 (GM Reference No. P002045-PTE-CD), 11/561,100 filed on<br>
November 17, 2006, 11/561,108 filed on November 17, 2006, and 11/557,715<br>
filed on November 8, 2006. The disclosures of the above applications are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0003] The present disclosure relates to particulate matter (PM) filters,<br>
and more particularly to electrically heated PM filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br><br>
[0005] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulate matter (PM)<br>
that is filtered from exhaust gas by a PM filter. The PM filter is disposed in an<br>
exhaust system of the engine. The PM filter reduces emission of PM that is<br>
generated during combustion.<br>
[0006] Over time, the PM filter becomes full. During regeneration, the<br>
PM may be burned within the PM filter. Regeneration may involve heating the<br>
PM filter to a combustion temperature of the PM. There are various ways to<br>
perform regeneration including modifying engine management, using a fuel<br>
burner, using a catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature after<br>
injection of fuel, using resistive heating coils, and/or using microwave energy.<br>
The resistive heating coils are typically arranged in contact with the PM filter to<br>
allow heating by both conduction and convection.<br>
[0007] Diesel PM combusts when temperatures above a combustion<br>
temperature such as 600 °C are attained. The start of combustion causes a<br>
further increase in temperature. While spark-ignited engines typically have low<br>
oxygen levels in the exhaust gas stream, diesel engines have significantly higher<br>
oxygen levels. While the increased oxygen levels make fast regeneration of the<br>
PM filter possible, it may also pose some problems.<br>
[0008] PM reduction systems that use fuel tend to decrease fuel<br>
economy. For example, many fuel-based PM reduction systems decrease fuel<br>
economy by 5%. Electrically heated PM reduction systems reduce fuel economy<br>
by a negligible amount. However, durability of the electrically heated PM<br>
reduction systems has been difficult to achieve.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] A system includes a particulate matter (PM) filter that includes<br>
an upstream end for receiving exhaust gas and a downstream end. A zoned<br>
resistive heater is arranged spaced from said upstream end and includes N<br>
zones, where N is an integer greater than one, wherein each of the N zones<br>
includes M sub-zones, where M is an integer greater than or equal to one, and<br>
wherein the heater includes an electrically insulating material. A control module<br>
selectively activates at least a selected one of the N zones to initiate<br>
regeneration in downstream portions of the PM filter from the one of the N zones<br>
and deactivates non-selected ones of the N zones.<br>
[0010] A method includes providing a particulate matter (PM) filter<br>
including an upstream end for receiving exhaust gas and a downstream end,<br>
arranging a zoned resistive heater spaced from the upstream end that includes N<br>
zones, where N is an integer greater than one, wherein each of the N zones<br>
comprises M sub-zones, where M is an integer greater than or equal to one, and<br>
wherein the heater includes an electrically insulating material, and selectively<br>
activating at least a selected one of the N zones to initiate regeneration in<br>
downstream portions of the PM filter from the one of the N zones and deactivates<br>
non-selected ones of the N zones.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0026] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0027] The present disclosure utilizes a heater with zones. The<br>
electrical heater is spaced from the PM filter. In other words, the electric heater<br>
is located in front of the PM filter but is not in contact with the downstream PM<br>
filter. The heater selectively heats portions of the PM filter. The PM heater may<br>
be mounted close enough to the front of the PM filter to control the heating<br>
pattern. The length of the heater is set to optimize the exhaust gas temperature.<br>
[0028] Thermal energy is transmitted from the heater to the PM filter by<br>
the exhaust gas. Therefore the PM filter is predominantly heated by convection.<br><br>
The electrical heater is divided into zones to reduce electrical power required to<br>
heat the PM filter. The zones also heat selected downstream portions within the<br>
PM filter. By heating only the selected portions of the filter, the magnitude of<br>
forces in the substrate is reduced due to thermal expansion. As a result, higher<br>
localized soot temperatures may be used during regeneration without damaging<br>
the PM filter.<br>
[0029] The PM filter is regenerated by selectively heating one or more<br>
of the zones in the front of the PM filter and igniting the soot using the heated<br>
exhaust gas. When a sufficient face temperature is reached, the heater is turned<br>
off and the burning soot then cascades down the length of the PM filter channel,<br>
which is similar to a burning fuse on a firework. In other words, the heater may<br>
be activated only long enough to start the soot ignition and is then shut off. Other<br>
regeneration systems typically use both conduction and convection and maintain<br>
power to the heater (at lower temperatures such as 600 degrees Celsius)<br>
throughout the soot burning process. As a result, these systems tend to use<br>
more power than the system proposed in the present disclosure.<br>
[0030] The burning soot is the fuel that continues the regeneration.<br>
This process is continued for each heating zone until the PM filter is completely<br>
regenerated.<br>
[0031] The heater zones are spaced in a manner such that thermal<br>
stress is mitigated between active heaters. Therefore, the overall stress forces<br>
due to heating are smaller and distributed over the volume of the entire<br>
electrically heated PM filter. This approach allows regeneration in larger<br><br>
segments of the electrically heated PM filter without creating thermal stresses<br>
that damage the electrically heated PM filter.<br>
[0032] A largest temperature gradient occurs at edges of the heaters.<br>
Therefore, activating one heater past the localized stress zone of another heater<br>
enables more actively heated regeneration volume without an increase in overall<br>
stress. This tends to improve the regeneration opportunity within a drive cycle<br>
and reduces cost and complexity since the system does not need to regenerate<br>
as many zones independently.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary diesel engine system 10<br>
is schematically illustrated in accordance with the present disclosure. It is<br>
appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration system described herein can<br>
be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate filter.<br>
Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct injection<br>
engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine systems.<br>
For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the context of a<br>
diesel engine system.<br>
[0034] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br><br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0035] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, the systems and methods of the<br>
present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders<br>
including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders. It is also<br>
appreciated that the systems and methods of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a V-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected into the cylinders<br>
26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture.<br>
Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust exits the cylinders<br>
26 into the exhaust system-<br>
[0036] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PM filter) assembly 34 with a<br>
zoned inlet heater 35. Optionally, an EGR valve (not shown) re-circulates a<br>
portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold 22. The remainder of the<br>
exhaust is directed into the turbacharger 18 to drive a turbine. The turbine<br>
facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the air filter 14. Exhaust<br>
flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC 32, through the zoned heater 35<br>
and into the PM filter assembly 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on<br>
the post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the<br>
temperature of the exhaust. The PM filter assembly 34 receives exhaust from<br>
the DOC 32 and filters any soot particulates present in the exhaust. The zoned<br><br>
inlet heater 35 is spaced from the PM filter assembly 34 and heats the exhaust to<br>
a regeneration temperature as will be described below.<br>
[0037] A control module 44 controls the engine and PM filter<br>
regeneration based on various sensed information. More specifically, the control<br>
module 44 estimates loading of the PM filter assembly 34. When the estimated<br>
loading is at a predetermined level and the exhaust flow rate is within a desired<br>
range, current is controlled to the PM filter assembly 34 via a power source 46 to<br>
initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the regeneration process may<br>
be varied based upon the estimated amount of particulate matter within the PM<br>
filter assembly 34.<br>
[0038] Current is applied to the zoned heater 35 during the<br>
regeneration process. More specifically, the energy heats selected zones of the<br>
heater 35 of the PM filter assembly 34 for predetermined periods, respectively.<br>
Exhaust gas passing through the heater 35 is heated by the activated zones.<br>
The heated exhaust gas travels to the downstream filter of PM filter assembly 34<br>
and heats the filter by convection. The remainder of the regeneration process is<br>
achieved using the heat generated by the heated exhaust passing through the<br>
PM filter.<br>
[0039] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary zoned inlet heater 35 for<br>
the PM filter assembly 34 is shown in further detail. The zoned inlet heater 35 is<br>
arranged spaced from the PM filter assembly 34. The PM filter assembly 34<br>
includes multiple spaced heater zones including zone 1 (with sub-zones 1A, 1B<br>
and 1C), zone 2 (with sub-zones 2A, 2B and 2C) and zone 3 (with sub-zones 3A,<br><br>
3B and 3C). The zones 1, 2 and 3 may be activated during different respective<br>
periods.<br>
[0040] As exhaust gas flows through the activated zones of the heater,<br>
regeneration occurs in the corresponding portions of the PM filter that initially<br>
received the heated exhaust gas (e.g. areas downstream from the activated<br>
zones) or downstream areas that are ignited by cascading burning soot. The<br>
corresponding portions of the PM filter that are not downstream from an activated<br>
zone act as stress mitigation zones. For example in FIG. 2, sub-zones 1A, 1B<br>
and 1C are activated and sub-zones 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, and 3C act as stress<br>
mitigation zones.<br>
[0041] The corresponding portions of the PM filter downstream from<br>
the active heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C thermally expand and contract during<br>
heating and cooling. The stress mitigation sub-zones 2A and 3A, 2B and 3B,<br>
and 2C and 3C mitigate stress caused by the expansion and contraction of the<br>
heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C. After zone 1 has completed regeneration,<br>
zone 2 can be activated and zones 1 and 3 act as stress mitigation zones. After<br>
zone 2 has completed regeneration, zone 3 can be activated and zones 1 and 2<br>
act as stress mitigation zones.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIG. 3A, another exemplary zoned inlet heater<br>
arrangement is shown. A center portion may be surrounded by a middle portion<br>
including a first circumferential band of zones. The middle portion may be<br>
surrounded by an outer portion including a second circumferential band of zones.<br><br>
[0043] In this example, the center portion includes zone 1, The first<br>
circumferential band of zones includes zgnes 2 and 3. The second<br>
circumferential band of zones comprises zones 1, 4 and 5. As with the<br>
embodiment described above, downstream portions from active zones are<br>
regenerated while downstream portions from inactive zones provide stress<br>
mitigation. As can be appreciated, one of the zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be<br>
activated at a time. Others of the zones remain inactivated.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 3B, an exemplary resistive heater 100<br>
arranged adjacent to one of the zones (e.g. zone 3) from the first circumferential<br>
band of zones in FIG. 3A is shown. The resistive heater 100 may comprise one<br>
or more coils that cover the respective zone to provide sufficient heating.<br>
[0045] Referring now to FIG. 4A, another exemplary zoned inlet heater<br>
arrangement is shown. A center portion may be surrounded by an outer portion<br>
including a circumferential band of zones. In this example, the center portion<br>
includes zone 1. The circumferential band of zones includes zones 2, 3, 4, and<br>
5. As with the embodiment described above, downstream portions from active<br>
zones are regenerated while downstream portions from inactive zones provide<br>
stress mitigation. As can be appreciated, one of the zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can<br>
be activated at a time. Others of the zones remain inactivated. In other<br>
implementations, multiple zones may be activated at the same time. For<br>
example, complementary zones (e.g. zones 2 and 4 or zones 3 and 5) may be<br>
activated at the same time.<br><br>
[0046] Referring now to FIG. 4B, an exemplary resistive heater 110<br>
arranged adjacent to one of the zones (e.g. zone 2) from the first circumferential<br>
band of zones in FIG. 4A is shown. The resistive heater 110 may comprise one<br>
or more coils that cover the respective zone to provide sufficient heating.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 5, the PM filter assembly 34 is shown in<br>
further detail. The PM filter assembly 34 includes a housing 200, a filter 202, and<br>
the zoned heater 35. The heater 35 may be arranged between a laminar flow<br>
element 210 and a substrate of the filter 202. An electrical connector 211 may<br>
provide current to the zones of the PM filter assembly 34 as described above.<br>
[0048] As can be appreciated, the heater 35 may be spaced from the<br>
filter 202 such that the heating is predominantly convection heating. Insulation<br>
212 may be arranged between the heater 35 and the housing 200. Exhaust gas<br>
enters the PM filter assembly 34 from an upstream inlet 214 and is heated by<br>
one or more zones of the PM filter assembly 34. The heated exhaust gas travels<br>
a distance and is received by the filter 202. The heater 35 may be spaced from<br>
and not in contact with the filter 202.<br>
[0049] Referring now to FIG. 6, heating within the PM filter assembly<br>
34 is shown in further detail. Exhaust gas 250 passes through the heater 35 and<br>
is heated by one or more zones of the heater 35. The heated exhaust gas<br>
travels a distance "d" and is then received by the filter 202. The distance "d" may<br>
be 1/2" or less. The filter 202 may have a central inlet 240, a channel 242, filter<br>
material 244 and an outlet 246 located radially outside of the inlet. The filter may<br>
be catalyzed. The heated exhaust gas causes PM in the filter to burn, which<br><br>
regenerates the PM filter. The heater 35 transfers heat by convection to ignite a<br>
front portion of the filter 202. When the soot in the front face portions reaches a<br>
sufficiently high temperature, the heater is turned off. Combustion of soot then<br>
cascades down a filter channel 254 without requiring power to be maintained to<br>
the heater.<br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 7, steps for regenerating the PM filter are<br>
shown. In step 300, control begins and proceeds to step 304. If control<br>
determines that regeneration is needed in step 304, control selects one or more<br>
zones in step 308 and activates the heater for the selected zone in step 312. In<br>
step 316, control estimates a heating period sufficient to achieve a minimum filter<br>
face temperature based on at least one of current, voltage, exhaust flow and<br>
exhaust temperature. The minimum face temperature should be sufficient to<br>
start the soot burning and to create a cascade effect. For example only, the<br>
minimum face temperature may be set to 700 degrees Celsius or greater. In an<br>
alternate step 320 to step 316, control estimates current and voltage needed to<br>
achieve minimum filter face temperature based on a predetermined heating<br>
period, exhaust flow and exhaust temperature.<br>
[0051] In step 324, control determines whether the heating period is<br>
up. If step 324 is true, control determines whether additional zones need to be<br>
regenerated in step 326. If step 326 is true, control returns to step 308.<br>
Otherwise control ends.<br>
[0052] In use, the control module determines when the PM filter<br>
requires regeneration. Alternately, regeneration can be performed periodically or<br><br>
on an event basis. The control module may estimate when the entire PM filter<br>
needs regeneration or when zones within the PM filter need regeneration. When<br>
the control module determines that the entire PM filter needs regeneration, the<br>
control module sequentially activates one or more of the zones at a time to<br>
initiate regeneration within the associated downstream portion of the PM filter.<br>
After the zone or zones are regenerated, one or more other zones are activated<br>
while the others are deactivated. This approach continues until all of the zones<br>
have been activated. When the control module determines that one of the zones<br>
needs regeneration, the control module activates the zone corresponding to the<br>
associated downstream portion of the PM filter needing regeneration.<br>
[0053] Referring now to FIG. 8, a zoned resistive heater grid 400 that<br>
corresponds to the zoned inlet heat arrangement of FIG. 4A is shown. The<br>
heater grid 400 includes a center portion 402 corresponding to zone 1 and an<br>
outer portion 404 corresponding to zones 2, 3, 4, and 5. Zones of the heater grid<br>
400 may be selectively activated and deactivated as described above with<br>
respect to FIGS. 1-7.<br>
[0054] Resistive coils in individual zones of the heater grid 400 may<br>
expand while activated (i.e. due to thermal expansion). Consequently, a selected<br>
(activated) zone may expand and come into contact with adjacent non-selected<br>
(deactivated) zones. For example, a portion of the heater grid 400 corresponding<br>
to zone 2 may expand and come into contact with one or more of zones 1, 4, and<br>
5. When an activated zone contacts an adjacent deactivated zone, the current<br>
applied to the activated zone flows into the adjacent deactivated zone. In other<br><br>
words, the activated zone is short circuited. When the activated zone is short<br>
circuited, the corresponding zone of the filter does not reach the desired<br>
minimum filter face temperature and proper filter regeneration is prevented.<br>
[0055] Referring now to FIG. 9, resistive coils of the zoned resistive<br>
heater grid 400 are coated with an insulating material 410. The insulating<br>
material 410 prevents the resistive coils of a selected zone from contacting<br>
adjacent zones. In other words, even when the resistive coils experience thermal<br>
expansion, the insulating material 410 prevents short circuiting in the selected<br>
zone. The insulating material 410 is thermally conductive to allow the heat from<br>
the heater grid 400 to heat the exhaust gas. Conversely, the insulating material<br>
410 is not electrically conductive. As such, current flowing through the resistive<br>
coil of a selected zone is prevented from flowing into an adjacent zone. Further,<br>
the insulating material 410 may be selected to thermally expand at a rate<br>
consistent with thermal expansion of the heater grid 400. For example only, the<br>
insulating material 410 may include aluminum oxide.<br>
[0056] Referring now to FIG. 10, the zoned resistive heater grid 400<br>
includes an insulating buffer 420. The insulating buffer 420 is located between<br>
each of the zones of the heater grid 400. For example, the insulating buffer 420<br>
may include a center portion 422 that surrounds zone 1 of the heater grid 400<br>
and a plurality of spokes 424 that extend outward from the center portion 422.<br>
Each of the plurality of spokes extends between adjacent ones of the zones in<br>
the outer portion of the heater grid 400.<br><br>
[0057] As described above with respect to FIG. 9, the insulating buffer<br>
420 is thermally conductive but is not electrically conductive. As such, current<br>
flowing through the resistive coil of a selected zone is prevented from flowing into<br>
an adjacent zone and short circuiting is avoided. For example only, the<br>
insulating buffer 420 may include aluminum oxide.<br>
[0058] In another implementation, the control module 44 (as shown in<br>
FIG. 1) may detect short circuits due to thermal expansion. For example, the<br>
control module 44 may detect short circuits when the zoned resistive heater grid<br>
400 does not include one of the insulating material 410 and the insulating buffer<br>
420 and/or when one of the insulating material 410 and the insulating buffer 420<br>
is damaged. For example, the control module 44 may measure a voltage across<br>
at least a portion of non-selected (deactivated) zones of the heater grid 400.<br>
When a voltage is detected (e.g. when the voltage across one or more of the<br>
deactivated zones is greater than a threshold), the control module 44 determines<br>
that the activated zone is in contact with an adjacent one of the deactivated<br>
zones and, thus, is short circuited. Consequently, the control module 44 may<br>
deactivate the activated zone and activate a non adjacent zone. For example,<br>
when a short circuit is detected when zone 2 is activated, the control module 44<br>
may deactivate zone 2 and activate zone 3. Further, the control module 44 may<br>
indicate a fault that indicates that one of the heater grid 400, the insulating<br>
material 410, and the insulating buffer 420 needs to be replaced.<br><br>
[0059] The present disclosure may substantially reduce the fuel<br>
economy penalty, decrease tailpipe temperatures, and improve system<br>
robustness due to the smaller regeneration time.<br><br>
