				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ORDERING A PRODUCT<br>
OVER AN INTERNETWORK OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for ordering a product over<br>
an internetwork of computer systems and generally relates a method and apparatus<br>
for allowing a consumer to order goods, services and content from one or more<br>
other computers connected via common communication links and, more<br>
specifically, a method and apparatus for allowing a consumer to order goods,<br>
services and content from computers connected to the Internet, wherein the<br>
consumer is automatically billed for the ordered goods, services or content by its<br>
telephone service provider.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Communication networks are well known in the computer communications<br>
field. By definition, a network is a group of computers and associated devices that<br>
are connected by communications facilities or links. Network communications can<br>
be of a permanent nature, such as via cables, or can be of a temporary nature, such as<br>
connections made through telephone or radio links. Networks may vary in size, from<br>
a local area network (LAN) consisting of a few computers or workstations and<br>
related devices; to a wide area network (WAN) which interconnects computers and<br>
LANs that are geographically dispersed; to a remote access service (RAS) which<br>
interconnects remote computers via temporary communication links. An<br>
internetwork, in turn, is the joining of multiple computer networks, both similar and<br>
dissimilar, by means of gateways or routers that facilitate data transfer and<br>
conversion from various networks. A well-known abbreviation for the term<br>
internetwork is "internet." As currently understood, the capitalized term "Internet"<br>
refers to the collection of networks and routers that use the Transmission Control<br>
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with one another.<br>
A representative section of the Internet 20 is shown in FIGURE 1 (Prior Art)<br>
in which a plurality of local area networks (LANs) 24 and a wide area network<br>
(WAN) 26 are interconnected by routers 22. The routers 22 are generally special<br>
purpose computers used to interface one LAN or WAN to another. Communication<br>
links within the LANs may be twisted wire pair, or coaxial cable, while<br>
communication links between networks may utilize 56 Kbps analog telephone lines,<br>
or 1 Mbps digital T-l lines and/or 45 Mbps T-3 lines. Further, computers and other<br>
related electronic devices can be remotely connected to either the LANs 24 or the<br>
WAN 26 via a modem and temporary telephone link. Such computers and electronic<br>
devices 28 are shown in FIGURE 1 as connected to one of the LANs 24 via a dotted<br>
line. It will be appreciated that the Internet comprises a vast number of such<br>
interconnected networks, computers, and routers and that only a small, representative<br>
section of the Internet 20 is shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
The Internet has recently seen explosive growth by virtue of its ability to link<br>
computers located throughout the world. As the Internet has grown, so has the World<br>
Wide Web (WWW). The WWW is a vast collection of interconnected or "hypertext"<br>
documents written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) that are electronically<br>
stored at "Web sites" throughout the Internet. A Web site is a server connected to the<br>
Internet that has mass storage facilities for storing hypertext documents and that runs<br>
administrative software for handling requests for those stored hypertext documents.<br>
A hypertext document normally includes a number of hyperlinks, i.e., highlighted<br>
portions of text which link the document to another hypertext document possibly<br>
stored at a Web site elsewhere on the Internet. Each hyperlink is associated with a<br>
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that provides the exact location of the linked<br>
document on a server connected to the Internet and describes the document. Thus,<br>
whenever a hypertext document is retrieved from any Web server, the document is<br>
considered to be retrieved from the WWW.<br>
A consumer is allowed to retrieve hypertext documents from the WWW, i.e.,<br>
a consumer is allowed to "surf the Web," via a Web browser. A Web browser, such<br>
as Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer, is a software program<br>
implemented by a Web client, i.e., the consumer's computer, to provide a graphical<br>
user interface to the WWW. Upon request from the consumer via the Web browser,<br>
the Web client accesses and retrieves the desired hypertext document from the<br>
appropriate Web server using the URL for the document and a protocol known as<br>
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a higher-level protocol then TCP/IP<br>
and is designed specifically for the requirements of the WWW. It is used on top of<br>
TCP/IP to transfer hypertext documents between servers and clients.<br>
At the advent of the WWW, the information stored on the Internet was freely<br>
transferred back and forth between those parties interested in the information.<br>
However, the WWW is quickly becoming a channel of commerce whereby a vast<br>
number and array of companies have developed their own Web sites for advertising<br>
and selling their goods and services. Consumers may "visit the Web site" of a<br>
company, i.e., retrieve the hypertext documents located on the Web server of a<br>
particular company, and order any good or service the company has to offer. If that<br>
good or service is in the form of electronically stored information, such as a book, a<br>
video, a music CD, a computer game, etc., the consumer may simply download the<br>
good or service from the company's Web site to his or her computer for immediate<br>
consumption and use. If the good or service is of a more tangible nature, such as an<br>
appliance or article of clothing ordered from an on-line catalog, a more conventional<br>
method of delivery, e.g., the postal service, is used. The traditional method of<br>
payment for such goods and services has been by major credit card, wherein the<br>
consumer is required to transmit his or her credit information over the Internet to the<br>
company's Web site. However, many question the security and confidentiality of<br>
such electronic transmissions. Furthermore, many consumers do not have a major<br>
credit card with which to make such purchases. Alternative billing systems, such as<br>
providing credit information by facsimile or postal service, are much less convenient<br>
and often prove enough of a barrier to prohibit the sale altogether. Finally, the<br>
traditional methods of billing and payment do not adequately protect the seller or<br>
consumer from fraudulent purchases.<br>
In addition to goods and services, many companies also wish to provide<br>
consumers with "premium content," i.e., hypertext documents and other<br>
electronically stored and transferable information considered to have a monetary<br>
value to the company. Examples of such premium content may include magazine<br>
articles, proprietary databases, movies, stock information, radio broadcasts, etc. The<br>
traditional method of payment for accessing such content has also been by major<br>
credit card, wherein the consumer pays for a subscription to the content and is<br>
required to transmit his or her credit information over the Internet to the company's<br>
Web site. Again, this method billing and payment does not adequately protect the<br>
seller or consumer from fraudulent purchases and does not provide the consumer with<br>
adequate security.<br>
Accordingly, a more effective method and apparatus for ordering and billing<br>
for goods, services and content over a network, and ultimately the Internet, is needed.<br>
The method and apparatus should provide for automatic billing to the consumer<br>
without the need of a credit card or transferring any sensitive credit information via<br>
the Internet. In addition, the consumer should be allowed to use the purchased good<br>
or service, if downloaded, only after billing is completed. Finally., the method and<br>
apparatus should prevent consumers with histories of nonpayment from purchasing<br>
additional goods, services and/or content.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a computer program for ordering products,<br>
including goods, services and content, from computers connected to the Internet,<br>
wherein the consumer is automatically billed for the ordered good, service or content<br>
by its telephone service provider. In one actual embodiment of the invention, the<br>
billing system comprises a plug-in component and a billing server component. When<br>
a consumer orders a product over the Internet, the plug-in component establishes an<br>
Internet connection to a billing server located elsewhere on the Internet. In response,<br>
the billing server component transfers a transaction I.D. identifying the order to the<br>
plug-in component. The plug-in component then disconnects from the Internet and<br>
establishes a point-to-point (PPP) connection with the billing server. Once the PPP<br>
connection is established, the plug in component transfers the transaction I.D. back to<br>
the billing server component. The billing server component then transfers the access<br>
key assigned to the order identified by the transaction I.D. to the plug-in component.<br>
The consumer uses the access key to claim the ordered product. The consumer is<br>
charged for the product automatically by the telephone service provider when the<br>
PPP connection is established using a telephone number assigned and administered<br>
by the telephone service provider.<br>
In accordance with yet other aspects of the present invention, the billing<br>
server component also transfers an encrypted version of the ordered product to the<br>
plug-in component before the plug-in components disconnects from the Internet. The<br>
plug-in component then uses the access key to decrypt the encrypted version of the<br>
product.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the billing system comprises<br>
a plug-in component, a billing server component and a merchant server component<br>
for ordering products, such as premium content, over the Internet for which the<br>
consumer will be billed at a per minute rate for accessing the content. When the<br>
consumer orders the product over the Internet, the plug-in component establishes a<br>
premium telephone communication link to a billing server located elsewhere on the<br>
Internet and transfers the order for the product to the billing server. The billing<br>
server component then establishes an Internet connection with a merchant server<br>
capable of providing the ordered product and forwards the order for the product to the<br>
merchant server. In response, the merchant server component supplies the billing<br>
server component and the plug-in component with the information necessary for the<br>
plug-in component to locate and access the ordered product. The consumer is then<br>
charged for the ordered product by the telephone service provider as the consumer<br>
accesses the ordered product during the premium telephone communication link with<br>
the billing server. More specifically, the consumer is charged for the duration of the<br>
premium telephone link at a predetermined rate associated with the ordered product<br>
and the premium telephone communication link.<br>
In accordance, with yet other aspect of the present invention, the billing server<br>
component provides the plug-in component with a premium telephone number and<br>
the predetermined rate at which the consumer will be billed for the ordered product<br>
via an Internet connection established with the billing server prior to the establishing<br>
of the premium telephone communication link with the billing server.<br>
A method and an apparatus capable of performing actions generally consistent<br>
with the plug-in component, billing server component and merchant component<br>
described above represent further aspects of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for ordering a product over an<br>
internetwork of computer systems, wherein the product is ordered from a computer<br>
connected to the internetwork and supplied by a server connected to the internetwork, the<br>
method comprising the steps of: (a) establishing a connection between the computer and<br>
the server via the internetwork of computer systems; (b) transferring a transaction<br>
identification from the server to the computer, wherein the transaction identification<br>
identifies the product ordered and the computer ordering the product; (c) terminating the<br>
connection between the computer and the server via the internetwork of computer systems;<br>
(d) establishing a direct connection between the computer and the server; (e) transferring<br>
the transaction identification from the computer to the server to identify the product ordered<br>
and the computer ordering the product; and (f) transferring an access key assigned to the<br>
product ordered and the computer ordering the product from the server to the computer that<br>
is used to claim the product ordered by the computer.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for ordering a product from a<br>
plurality of computers and servers connected to form an internetwork, the apparatus<br>
comprising: (a) a consumer's computer comprising a network interface for connecting to the<br>
internetwork, a processing unit coupled to the network interface, and a storage medium<br>
coupled to the processing unit, the storage medium containing program code executed by<br>
the processing unit for placing an order for the product by: (i) establishing a connection to<br>
the billing server via an internetwork communication link; (ii) transferring the order to the<br>
billing server via the internetwork communication link; (iii) terminating the connection to the<br>
billing server via the internetwork communication link after the transaction identification has<br>
been received from the billing server; (iv) establishing a connection to the billing server via a<br>
premium communication link; and (v) transferring the transaction identification back to the<br>
billing server via the premium communication link; and (b) a billing server comprising a<br>
network interface for connecting to the internetwork, a processing unit coupled to the<br>
network interface, and a storage medium coupled to the processing unit, the storage<br>
medium containing program code executed by the processing unit for processing the order<br>
for the product placed by the consumer's computer by transferring a transaction<br>
identification to the consumer's computer via the internetwork communication link, which<br>
identifies the order placed by the consumer's computer.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for ordering a product over an<br>
internetwork of computer systems, wherein the product is ordered by a consumer's<br>
computer connected to the internetwork, the method comprising the steps of: (a)<br>
establishing a premium telephone connection between the consumer's computer and a<br>
billing server connected to the internetwork; (b) during the premium telephone connection<br>
between the consumer's computer and the billing server: (i) providing the consumer's<br>
computer with access information comprising an access identification to a designated<br>
communication session between the consumer's computer and a merchant server<br>
connected to the internetwork, a password for claiming the ordered product, a locator for<br>
the ordered product identifying the location of the ordered product on the merchant server<br>
connected to the internetwork; (ii) establishing an internetwork connection between the<br>
consumer's computer and the merchant using access information; and (iii) transferring the<br>
ordered product from the merchant server to the consumer's computer.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
As previously described and shown in FIGURE 1, the Internet 20 is a<br>
collection of local area networks and (LANs) 24, wide area networks (WANs) 26,<br>
remote computers 28 and routers 22 that use the Transmission Control<br>
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with each other. The World<br>
Wide Web (WWW), on the other hand, is vast collection of interconnected,<br>
electronically stored information located on servers connected throughout the<br>
Internet 20. Many companies are now selling goods, services and access to their<br>
premium content over the Internet using the WWW. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, a consumer orders goods, services and/or content (referred to<br>
interchangeably herein as "products") over the Internet 20 via a Web browser and is<br>
automatically billed for the purchase on his or her monthly telephone bill. More<br>
specifically, the consumer places an order for goods, services, or premium content<br>
from a computer 42 connected to the Internet 20. The order is processed and<br>
confirmed by a billing server 34 connected to a LAN 24 located elsewhere in the<br>
Internet 20, which obtains the product from a merchant server 39, i.e., a server owned<br>
by the merchant which sponsors or sells the product, also located elsewhere in the<br>
Internet 20.<br>
The LAN 24 to which the billing server 34 is connected and to which the<br>
consumer's computer 42 has established an Internet connection for ordering a<br>
product is shown in more detail in FIGURE 2. In addition to the billing server 34,<br>
the LAN 24 includes an administrative computer 32 used to administer product,<br>
vendor, and purchaser information and services provided by the billing server 34.<br>
The LAN 24 also includes an access server 38 equipped with a plurality of high-<br>
speed digital modems used to accept temporary telephone links from other computers<br>
located in the Internet 20, such as the consumer's computer 42. Finally, LAN 24<br>
includes a personal computer 36 installed with a computer supported telephony<br>
application (CSTA). which is a standard protocol used in North America to interface<br>
the computer 36 with a telephone switch 40. However, those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that in other embodiments of the present invention, the access<br>
server 38 is itself equipped with computer telephony/caller identification software<br>
that is appropriate for the particular telephone system in which the telephone<br>
switch 40 is operative. Consequently, it will be appreciated that in these<br>
embodiments, the CSTA monitor 36 is unnecessary.<br>
As will be described in more detail below, after the consumer places an order<br>
using the computer 42 via the Internet 20, the consumer's computer disconnects from<br>
the Internet 20 and establishes a point-to-point (PPP) connection with the billing<br>
server 34 to confirm the purchase. More specifically, the consumer's computer<br>
places a telephone call to a premium telephone number assigned to the telephone<br>
switch 40. The telephone switch routes the premium telephone call to the access<br>
server 38, whose modems answer the telephone call and notify the billing server 34<br>
that a TCP/IP connection to the consumer's computer 42 has been established.<br>
Meanwhile, the CSTA monitor 36 which monitors the telephone switch 40 also<br>
notifies the billing server 34 that the telephone call has been made, thus completing<br>
the PPP connection between the billing server 34 and the consumer's computer 42.<br>
In those embodiments of the present invention which do not include a CSTA<br>
monitor 36, it will be appreciated that the computer telephony software resident on<br>
the access server 38 provides this function.<br>
In the actual embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGURE 2, the<br>
LAN 24 is insulated from the Internet 20 by a firewall server 30 which tracks and<br>
controls the flow of all data passing through it using the TCP/IP protocol. The<br>
firewall 30 protects the LAN 24 from malicious in-bound data traffic. The LAN 24<br>
is a bus network interconnecting the various computers and servers. The LAN 24<br>
shown in FIGURE 2 can be formed of various coupling media such as glass or plastic<br>
fiberoptic cables, coaxial cables, twisted wire pair cables, ribbon cables, etc. In<br>
addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the coupling medium can<br>
also include a radio frequency coupling media or other intangible coupling media.<br>
Any computer system or number of computer systems, including but not limited to<br>
workstations, personal computers, laptop computers, servers, remote computers, etc.,<br>
that is equipped with the necessary interface hardware may be connected temporarily<br>
or permanently to the LAN 24, and thus, the Internet 20. However, if temporarily<br>
connected via a telephone link to another device connected to the LAN 24, the<br>
interface hardware of both the remote computer 28 and the device to which it is<br>
connected must contain a modem. Finally, those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that while only one consumer computer 42, one billing server 34 and one<br>
merchant server 39 are depicted in FIGURE 2, numerous consumer computers,<br>
billing servers and merchant servers equipped with the hardware and software<br>
components described below may be connected to the Internet 20.<br>
Relevant Consumer Computer. Billing Server and Merchant Server Components<br>
FIGURE 3 depicts several of the key components of the consumer's<br>
computer 42. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the consumer's<br>
computer 42 includes many more components then those shown in FIGURE 3.<br>
However, it is not necessary that all of these generally conventional components be<br>
shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIGURE 3, the consumer's computer includes a network<br>
interface 44 for connecting to a LAN 24 or WAN 26, or for connecting remotely to a<br>
LAN or WAN. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the network<br>
interface 44 includes the necessary circuitry for such a connection, and is also<br>
constructed for use with the TCP/IP protocol, the particular network configuration of<br>
the LAN or WAN it is connecting to, and a particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The consumer's computer 42 also includes a processing unit 46, a display 48.<br>
a modem 49 and a memory 50. The memory 50 generally comprises a random access<br>
memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM) and a permanent mass storage device,<br>
such as a disk drive. The memory 50 stores the program code and data necessary for<br>
ordering a product over the Internet 20 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the memory 50 stores a plug-in component 52, 52' and/or 52"<br>
formed in accordance with the present invention for ordering products. It will be<br>
appreciated that this component may be stored on a computer-readable medium and<br>
loaded into memory 50 of the consumer computer 42 using a drive mechanism<br>
associated with the computer-readable medium, such as a floppy or CD-ROM drive.<br>
The memory 50 also includes a Web browser 51, such as Netscape's Navigator or<br>
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browsers.<br>
As will be described in more detail below, the products ordered by the<br>
consumer are supplied by a remote server, i.e., the billing server 34 located elsewhere<br>
on the Internet, e.g., in LAN 24 illustrated in FIGURE 2. FIGURE 4 depicts several<br>
of the key components of the billing server 34. Those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that the billing server 34 includes many more components then those<br>
shown in FIGURE 4. However, it is not necessary that all of these generally<br>
conventional components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment<br>
for practicing the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 4, the billing server 34 is<br>
connected to the LAN 24 via a network interface 54. Those of ordinary skill in the<br>
an will appreciate that the network interface 54 includes the necessary circuitry for<br>
connecting the billing server 34 to the LAN 24 and the firewall 30, and is constructed<br>
for use with the TCP/IP protocol, the bus network configuration of the LAN 24, and<br>
the particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The billing server 34 also includes a processing unit 56. a display 58, and a<br>
mass memory 60. The mass memory 60 generally comprises a random access<br>
memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and a permanent mass storage device,<br>
such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination<br>
thereof. The mass memory 60 stores the program code and data necessary for<br>
supplying products to consumers in accordance with the present invention. More<br>
specifically, the mass memory 60 stores a billing server component 62 and/or 62'<br>
formed in accordance with the present invention for supplying the ordered products<br>
and confirming the order of products. In addition, mass memory 60 stores a<br>
database 64 of product information continuously logged by the billing server 34<br>
regarding vendors, consumers and products. It will be appreciated by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the database 64 of product and logged information may<br>
also be stored on other servers or storage devices connected to the LAN 24. It will be<br>
appreciated that the billing server component 62, 62' and database 64 of product<br>
information may be stored on a computer-readable medium and loaded into mass<br>
memory 60 of the billing server 34 using a drive mechanism associated with the<br>
computer-readable medium, such as floppy or CD-ROM drive. Finally, mass<br>
memory 60 stores Web server software 66 for handling requests for stored<br>
information received via the Internet 20 and the WWW.<br>
As will also be described in more detail below, the products ordered by the<br>
consumer, and supplied by the billing server 34 may, in turn, be provided to the<br>
billing server by a merchant server 39 located elsewhere on the Internet 20.<br>
FIGURE 5 depicts several of the key components of the merchant server 39. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the merchant server 39 includes many<br>
more components than those shown in FIGURE 5. However, it is not necessary that<br>
all of these generally conventional components be shown in order to disclose an<br>
illustrative embodiment of practicing the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 5,<br>
the merchant server 39 includes a network interface 55 for connecting to a LAN 24 or<br>
WAN 26, or for connecting remotely to a LAN or WAN. Those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that the network interface 55 includes the necessary circuitry<br>
for such a connection, and is also constructed for use with the TCP/IP protocol, the<br>
particular network configuration of the LAN or WAN it is connecting to, and a<br>
particular type of coupling medium.<br>
The merchant server 39 also includes a processing unit 57, a display 59, and a<br>
mass memory 61. The mass memory 61 generally comprises a random access<br>
memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and a permanent mass storage device,<br>
such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, or combination<br>
thereof. In one actual embodiment of the present invention, the mass memory<br>
contains a product database 67 which includes the electronically stored good or<br>
service ordered by the consumer. In other embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
product database 67 stores the premium content ordered by the consumer, i.e., the<br>
hypertext documents or other electronically stored information considered of<br>
monetary value by the merchant. In such embodiments, the mass memory 61 also<br>
stores the program code and data necessary for supplying the billing server with the<br>
URL for the premium content, as well as other access information for the premium<br>
content. More specifically, the mass memory 61 stores a merchant session gateway<br>
component 65 formed in accordance with the present invention for providing the<br>
billing server 34 with the access information that will be necessary for the<br>
computer 42 to access the desired premium content. It will be appreciated that the<br>
merchant session gateway component 65 and product database 67 may be stored on a<br>
computer-readable medium and loaded into mass memory 61 of the merchant<br>
server 39 using a drive mechanism associated with the computer-readable medium,<br>
such as a floppy or CD-ROM drive. Finally, mass memory 61 stores Web server<br>
software 66 for handling requests for stored information, including the premium<br>
content, received via the Internet and the WWW.<br>
Ordering Goods and Services<br>
Consumer computers, such as computer 42, are normally provided with a<br>
Web browser 51 such as Netscape's Navigator to provide the consumers with a<br>
graphical user interface to the Internet and the WWW. FIGURE 6A illustrates the<br>
consumer's computer 42 that implements such a Web browser 51. The consumer's<br>
computer comprises a display or monitor 72, a keyboard 74, a mouse 76, and a main<br>
unit 78 that includes the components discussed above in connection with FIGURE 3.<br>
Monitor 72 includes a screen 73 on which elements of the Web browser 51 are<br>
displayed. Such elements include a main window 80 for displaying hypertext<br>
documents requested by the consumer and a graphics cursor 82.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment for practicing the present invention, a<br>
consumer may visit a merchant's Web site using the Web browser 51 and retrieve a<br>
hypertext document from which the consumer may order goods and services. For<br>
example, a consumer using computer 42 and Web browser 51 may retrieve the<br>
hypertext document shown in the main window 80 of FIGURE 6A from a book store<br>
Web site known hypothetically as "Albert's Book Emporium." The consumer makes<br>
a selection of a particular book by manipulating the graphics cursor 82 with the<br>
mouse 76 above the selection and "single-clicking." In response, an ordering<br>
window 70 is displayed on the screen 73 of the client's computer 42 as shown in<br>
FIGURE 6B. The ordering window 70 displays to the consumer yet another hypertext<br>
document which includes various payment options, i.e., major credit cards with<br>
electronic transmission of credit information or facsimile transmission of credit<br>
information. However, in accordance with the present invention., an automatic billing<br>
icon 68 is also displayed as a payment option. As will be described in more detail<br>
below, if the consumer selects the automatic billing icon 68, the consumer will<br>
automatically be billed a one-time or "drop" charge for the ordered product on his or<br>
her next monthly telephone bill.<br>
FIGURE 7 illustrates the logic implemented by the Web browser 51 installed<br>
on the client's computer 42 when the automatic billing icon 68 is selected. The logic<br>
begins in a block 100 and proceeds to a block 102 where the Web browser 51<br>
determines if the plug-in component 52 of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been installed on the client's computer 42. If not. the client's computer<br>
downloads the plug-in 52 from the billing server 34 via the Internet 20 and installs<br>
the plug-in 52 in memory 50 in a block 104. If the plug-in 52 is already installed on<br>
the client's computer 42 or if it was not installed, but then loaded, the logic proceeds<br>
to a block 106 where the piug-in component 52 is initialized by the client's<br>
computer 42. The logic then ends in a block 108. Those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that the plug-in 52 of the present invention is downloaded, installed<br>
and initialized on the client's computer using methods well-known in the computer<br>
network arts.<br>
Once the plug-in 52 is initialized, the plug-in 52 of the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention performs the logic depicted in FIGURES 8A-8C to place the<br>
consumer's order with the billing server 34. The logic begins in FIGURE 8A in a<br>
block 120 and proceeds to a block 122 in which the client's computer 42 establishes<br>
an Internet connection to the billing server 34 using well-known methods in the art.<br>
Next, in a block 124, the plug-in 52 displays a purchase confirmation window 84 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 9 A on the screen 73 of the client's computer 42. The confirmation<br>
window 84 confirms the consumer's purchase and provides the consumer with the<br>
opportunity to cancel the purchase. If the consumer enters "OK" the logic will<br>
continue to a block 126 where the plug-in transfers to the billing server 34 via the<br>
Internet 20 a product I.D. uniquely identifying the product ordered to the billing<br>
server 34 and a purchaser I.D. assigned to the consumer. As will be described in<br>
more detail below, the consumer is assigned a purchaser I.D. the first time it places<br>
an order with the billing server 34. Hence, if this is the first time that the consumer<br>
has placed an order, the consumer will not have been assigned a purchaser I.D. and<br>
no such I.D. will be transferred in block 126.<br>
After transferring the purchaser I.D. and product I.D. to the billing server 34,<br>
the plug-in 52 waits for the billing server 34 to transfer to the consumer's<br>
computer 42 a transaction I.D. which identifies the consumer, the product ordered by<br>
the consumer (by product I.D.), and the billing server 34 supplying the order (as<br>
noted above, there may be more than one billing server located elsewhere on the<br>
Internet 20). As will be described in more detail below, the transaction I.D. will be<br>
used later to verify the consumer's order. If the transaction I.D. has not yet been<br>
received by the consumer's computer 42, the plug-in 52 merely repeats decision<br>
block 128 (i.e.. essentially waits) until the transaction I.D. is received from the billing<br>
server 34. Once received, the plug-in 52 displays a directory prompt window 86 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 9B which prompts the consumer for a network or local directory<br>
on the consumer's computer 42 in which to store the product that the consumer has<br>
purchased. After entering the directory in which the consumer wishes to save the<br>
product that it has purchased, the logic proceeds to a block 132 where the consumer's<br>
computer 42 begins receiving an encrypted version of the product transferred by the<br>
billing server 34. However, as will be discussed in more detail below, the consumer<br>
is not allowed to decrypt the product until the consumer has actually been billed for<br>
the product. In this regard, the billing server 34 also transfers, and the consumer's<br>
computer 42 also receives, a premium telephone number that the consumer's<br>
computer. 42 uses to establish a PPP connection to the billing server 34 and obtain an<br>
access key for decrypting the product.<br>
While the encrypted product is being downloaded via the Internet 20, the<br>
plug-in 52 displays a download transaction status window 88 as shown in<br>
FIGURE 9C on the screen 73 of the consumer's computer 42 which indicates the<br>
changing status of the download to the consumer. Next, in a decision block 136, the<br>
plug-in 52 determines if the entire encrypted product has finally been received. If<br>
not. the logic repeats blocks 134 and 136 until the encrypted product has been<br>
completely downloaded to the consumer's computer 42.<br>
Once downloading of the encrypted product is complete, the plug-in 52<br>
displays in a block 137, an authorization transaction window 89 as shown in<br>
FIGURE 9D. Once the consumer depresses the OK button indicating authorization<br>
of the order, the plug-in 52 disconnects the consumer's computer 42 from the<br>
Internet 20 in a block 138 in FIGURE 9B. Next, in a block 140, the plug-in 52<br>
supplies the premium telephone number provided by the billing server 34 to the<br>
modem 49 of the computer 42 and the modem dials the number in order to establish a<br>
PPP connection to the billing server 34. In the actual embodiment of the present<br>
invention described herein, the premium telephone number provided by the billing<br>
server 34 and dialed by the modem 49 of the consumer's computer 42 is a<br>
"900 number," i.e., a ten digit number having with a 900 area code, assigned by the<br>
billing server's telephone service provider. As those of ordinary skill in the<br>
telephone switching arts will appreciate, the 900 area code has been generally<br>
reserved for commercial purposes, wherein the consumer is generally charged a flat<br>
rate, or a particular rate per minute for a telephone call, and a portion of that charge is<br>
paid by the telephone service provider to the vendor or merchant to whom<br>
the 900 number is assigned. It will be recognized, however, that other types of<br>
telephone numbers may be used and, in fact, mandated by the telephone service<br>
provider without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
The telephone call placed by the modem 49 is answered by the telephone<br>
switch 40 connected to the CSTA monitor 36 of the LAN 24. The telephone<br>
switch 40 routes the telephone call to the access server 38, which notifies the billing<br>
server 34. Accordingly, the consumer's computer 42 establishes a PPP connection<br>
via the telephone switch 40 and access server 38 with the billing server 34. While<br>
this connection is being established, the plug-in 52 displays an authorization<br>
window 90 as shown in FIGURE 9E on the screen 73 of the consumer's computer 42<br>
which indicates the changing status of the connection to the billing server 34 in a<br>
block 142.<br>
Once the PPP connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the billing<br>
server 34 is fully established, the plug-in 52 transfers the previously assigned<br>
transaction I.D. to the billing server 34 so that the billing server 34 may verify the<br>
order in a block 144. It will be recognized that many consumers may be placing<br>
orders simultaneously, and hence, many computers located elsewhere on the<br>
Internet 20 may be establishing PPP connections with the billing server 34 at any<br>
given time. Therefore, the transaction I.D. is necessary so that the billing server 34<br>
may identify the consumer and the order placed by the consumer, and supply the<br>
plug-in 52 installed on the consumer's computer 42 with the appropriate access key<br>
for decrypting the previously sent product. In other words, the transaction I.D. serves<br>
a type of claim ticket used by the consumer to claim the correct access key once<br>
billing is complete.<br>
Next, in a block 146, the plug-in 52 begins downloading the appropriate<br>
access key for the decrypting the product. As will be described in more detail below,<br>
as long as the billing server 34 receives the transaction I.D. from the plug-in 52<br>
within a certain time period (i.e., the free period at the beginning of a 900 telephone<br>
call during which the caller can hang-up without being charged), the billing server 34<br>
will transfer the appropriate access key for decrypting the encrypted product.<br>
Otherwise, the PPP connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the billing<br>
server 34 is terminated and the consumer is not billed for the telephone call or the<br>
product.<br>
While waiting for the access key, the plug-in 52 displays another<br>
authorization window 90 in a block 148 which notifies the consumer of the status of<br>
the download of the access key. In a decision block 150, the logic determines if the<br>
consumer's computer 42 has finally received the access key. If not, blocks 148 and<br>
150 are merely repeated until the access key is received. Once received, the plug-<br>
in 52 ends the telephone call, and hence, terminates its PPP connection with the<br>
billing server 34 in a block 152.<br>
After terminating the PPP connection with the billing server 34, the plug-<br>
in 52 begins decryption of the encrypted product using the access key in a block 154.<br>
In a block 156, the plug-in 52 displays another authorization window 90 notifying the<br>
consumer that decryption of the product is in progress in a block 156. Accordingly,<br>
in a decision block 158 the plug-in determines if the product has been fully<br>
decrypted. If not. blocks 156 and 158 are merely repeated until the product has been<br>
fully decrypted. Once fully decrypted, the logic proceeds to a block 160 shown in<br>
FIGURE 8C where the plug-in 52 deletes the encrypted product from memory 50 of<br>
the client's computer in an effort to save space. Next, in a block 162, the plug-in 52<br>
depicts a transaction completed window 91 on the screen 73 of the consumer's<br>
computer 42 as shown in FIGURE 9F. The consumer is then provided the option in<br>
the transaction completed window 91 to reconnect to the Internet via its normal<br>
Internet service provider. The logic for the plug-in 52 then ends in a block 164.<br>
Now that the logic implemented by the plug-in component 52 has been<br>
discussed, it is necessary to describe the billing server component 62 implemented by<br>
the billing server 34 in a first embodiment of the present invention to supply the<br>
encrypted product and access key to the consumer's computer 42. As shown in<br>
FIGURE 10, the logic implemented by the billing server component 62 to supply the<br>
encrypted product begins in a block 170 and proceeds to a decision block 172 where<br>
it determines whether the connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the<br>
billing server 34 has been established via the Internet 20. If not. decision block 172<br>
is merely repeated until such a connection has been established. Next, in a decision<br>
block 173, the billing server component determines if the product I.D. has been<br>
received from the consumer's computer 42. If not, decision block 173 is repeated<br>
until the product I.D. has been received.<br>
Once the product I.D. has been received, the billing server component 62<br>
determines if the consumer is new in a decision block 174, i.e.. if this is the first time<br>
this consumer has placed an order. If this is the first time the consumer has placed an<br>
order, then the plug-in 52 will be unable to provide the billing server 34 with a<br>
purchaser I.D. for the consumer. Accordingly, the billing server component 62<br>
assigns the consumer a purchaser I.D. in a block 176 and transfers the purchaser I.D.<br>
to the consumer's computer 42 in a block 178. As noted above, the plug-in 52 will<br>
return this purchaser I.D. each subsequent time the consumer places an order. The<br>
purchaser I.D. is logged in the product and information database 64 of the billing<br>
server and is used for accounting and recordkeeping purposes, such as payment<br>
histories, customer demographics, etc.<br>
If the consumer is not a first-time buyer or, is a first-time buyer and thus, has<br>
been assigned a purchaser I.D., the logic proceeds to a decision block 180 where the<br>
billing server component 62 determines whether an order by this particular consumer<br>
should be denied. More specifically, the billing server 34 determines whether the<br>
purchaser I.D. is blocked. It will be appreciated that over the course of time, certain<br>
consumers may fail to pay their telephone bills, which include the charges for the<br>
orders placed using the present invention. A log of such purchaser I.D.s will be<br>
maintained in the database of product and logged information 64 in mass memory' 60<br>
of the billing server 34. If the purchaser I.D. of the consumer placing the order<br>
matches one of the logged purchaser I.D.s, the consumer will be prevented from<br>
placing its order and notified appropriately in a block 182. Such notification may<br>
include a message displayed on the screen 73 of the consumer's computer 42<br>
followed by termination of the PPP connection between the billing server 34 and the<br>
consumer's computer 42 in a block 183. The logic then ends in a block 184. On the<br>
other hand, if the consumer is not blocked by purchaser I.D. in decision block 180.<br>
the logic proceeds to a block 186 where the billing server 34 assigns a transaction<br>
I.D. to the order and transfers the transaction I.D. to the consumer's computer 42.<br>
The transaction I.D. identifies the consumer, the product ordered (by product I.D.)<br>
and the billing server 34. As noted above, the plug-in 52 installed on the consumer's<br>
computer 42 waits for this transaction I.D. before prompting the consumer for a<br>
directory in which to store the product it has ordered.<br>
After transferring the transaction I.D. to the consumer's computer 42, the<br>
billing server component 62 locates the product ordered by the consumer and<br>
encrypts it in a block 188. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
that the product may be stored in the database 64 of product information located in<br>
mass memory 60 of the billing server 34 or it may be located on a merchant server 39<br>
located elsewhere in the Internet. If the product is located elsewhere, the billing<br>
server 34 will establish an Internet connection with the corresponding merchant<br>
server 39 and download the ordered product. It will also be appreciated that the<br>
product, whether located in mass memory 60 of the billing server 34 or elsewhere on<br>
the Internet 20, may be pre-encrypted. Therefore, it may not be necessary for the<br>
billing server component 62 to encrypt the product itself.<br>
Next, in a block 190, the billing server component 62 stores the encrypted<br>
product in a working director}' in mass memory 60 of the billing server 34 as a<br>
precursor to transferring it to the client's computer 42. In a block 192, the billing<br>
server component 62 selects an access key, i.e., password, for decrypting the<br>
encrypted product stored in the working directory. It will be appreciated that the<br>
billing server component 62 may select the access key from a predefined list stored in<br>
the database 64 of product and logged information, or the billing server<br>
component 62 may generate an access key at random or using various other selection<br>
algorithms. Once the access key has been selected by the billing server<br>
component 62, the billing server 34 transfers the encrypted product to the consumer's<br>
computer 42 as well as the telephone number that the plug-in 52 will use to establish<br>
a PPP connection with the billing server 34 so that billing can be performed and the<br>
access key may be provided to the plug-in 52. The logic then ends in a block 196.<br>
The logic employed in the first embodiment of the present invention by the<br>
billing server component 62 to confirm completion of billing for a placed order, and<br>
thus, supply the plug-in 52 with the access key is depicted in FIGURE 11. The logic<br>
begins in FIGURE 11 in a block 200 and proceeds to a decision block 202 where the<br>
billing server component 62 determines if a PPP connection has been established to<br>
the billing server 34 by any consumer computer 42 installed with a plug-in 52. As<br>
noted above, many consumers may be placing orders at any given time, and hence,<br>
many computers may be attempting to establish a PPP connection to the billing<br>
server 34 so that they may obtain the appropriate access key for decrypting their<br>
ordered product. Hence, decision block 202 is repeated until such a connection has<br>
been established.<br>
Once a PPP connection has been established, the logic proceeds to a decision<br>
block 204 where the billing server component 62 determines whether or not the order<br>
placed by the consumer should be denied by determining whether the purchaser I.D.<br>
assigned to the consumer and transferred to the billing server 34 by the plug-in 52 is<br>
blocked. If so, the consumer is appropriately notified, e.g., by a message displayed<br>
on the screen 73 of the consumer's computer 42, in a block 206. Accordingly, the<br>
billing server component 62 ends the premium telephone call and terminates the PPP<br>
connection with the consumer's computer 42. It will be appreciated from the<br>
discussion below, if the premium telephone call is ended at this time, i.e., before the<br>
expiration of the free period, the consumer will not be billed for the order placed.<br>
The logic then ends in a block 210.<br>
If the order is not denied based on purchaser I.D., the logic proceeds to a<br>
decision block 212 where it determines if the order should be denied based on the<br>
consumer's telephone number (i.e., the telephone number from which the modem 49<br>
of the consumer's computer is making the premium telephone call to the billing<br>
server 34) in a decision block 212. In one actual embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a list of telephone numbers is maintained by the CSTA monitor 36 of all<br>
consumers who have not paid their monthly telephone bills for ordered products or<br>
who have indicated that all purchases attempted from their telephone number should<br>
be denied. If the order is to be denied based on the consumer's telephone number,<br>
the CSTA monitor 36 automatically provides a busy signal to the modem 49 of the<br>
consumer's computer 42 in a block 206. Next, in a block 208, the telephone call<br>
made by the modem 49 of the consumer's computer, and hence the PPP connection to<br>
the billing server 34 is terminated. The logic then ends in a block 210.<br>
Returning to decision block 212, if the order is permitted, the logic proceeds<br>
to a decision block 214 in which the billing server component 62 determines if it has<br>
received the transaction I.D. from the plug-in 52. If not, the logic proceeds to another<br>
decision block 216 in which the billing server component 62 determines if the free<br>
period has almost expired. As noted above and described in more detail below, this<br>
free period is the time interval at the beginning of a 900 telephone call during which<br>
the consumer can hang up and not be charged for the telephone service by the<br>
telephone service provider. By default, the free period is normally 18.9 seconds.<br>
However, the free period is dictated by the telephone service provider, and hence,<br>
may vary accordingly. During the free period, the plug-in 52 may display a message,<br>
which informs the consumer that they may hang up and not be charged for the<br>
telephone call or the product. If the transaction I.D. is not received from the plug-<br>
in 52 during the free period, the billing server component 62 will automatically<br>
terminate the premium telephone call in a block 208, so that the consumer is not<br>
erroneously charged for the premium telephone call. Consequently, the logic ends in<br>
a block 210.<br>
If the transaction I.D. is received, with time to spare, the logic proceeds from<br>
decision block 214 to a decision block 217 where the billing server component 62<br>
determines if the free period has expired. In other words, once the billing server 34<br>
has received the transaction I.D. from the plug-in 52, the billing server component 62<br>
merely waits for the free period to expire. Once expired, the telephone service<br>
provider bills the consumer for the ordered product as will be discussed in more<br>
detail below and the billing server component 62 transfers the access key assigned to<br>
the order identified by the transaction I.D. to the consumer's computer 42 so that the<br>
plug-in 52 can decrypt the product previously provided by the billing server<br>
component 62. The logic then ends in a block 219.<br>
Now that the plug-in and billing server components of the present invention<br>
have been described, the actions provided by the telephone service provider in order<br>
to automatically bill the consumer for the ordered product are discussed in more<br>
detail in connection with FIGURE 12. The flow diagram begins in a block 220 and<br>
proceeds to a block 222 where the telephone service provider routes the premium<br>
telephone call made by the modem 49 of the consumer's computer 42 to the<br>
telephone switch 40 connected to the CSTA monitor 36 of the LAN 24. Once the<br>
telephone switch 40 answers the call, the telephone service provider waits for the free<br>
period described above to expire in a block 224 before it bills the consumer for the<br>
order in a block 226. In the meantime, either the consumer's computer 42 or the<br>
billing server 34 may terminate the telephone call and prevent billing for the order.<br>
Once the free period has expired, however, the telephone service provider bills the<br>
consumer for the ordered product as a unit charge or "drop charge" using its own<br>
internal accounting and billing procedures. Consequently, the charge for the product<br>
and the premium telephone call will appear on the consumer's next monthly<br>
telephone bill for the telephone number from which the modem 49 of the consumer's<br>
computer 42 made the telephone call to the billing server 34. In a block 228, the<br>
telephone service provider collects payment for the premium telephone call and the<br>
ordered product from the consumer via its normal collection processes. Once the<br>
telephone service provider has collected payment for the call, the telephone service<br>
provider pays a service charge to the provider of the billing server 34 in a block 230.<br>
This service charge can be a flat rate or can be a percentage of each order placed.<br>
FIGURE 13 is an overall diagram depicting the actions of the plug-<br>
in 52/consumer's computer 42 and the billing server component 62/billing server 34<br>
in parallel. Consequently, FIGURE 13 depicts the consumer's computer 42<br>
establishing an Internet connection to the billing server 34. The consumer's<br>
computer 42 then transfers the product I.D. of the ordered product to the billing<br>
server 34. In response, the billing server 34 transfers a transaction I.D. for the order<br>
to the consumer's computer 42. The billing server 34 also transfers the encrypted<br>
product and a telephone number for establishing a PPP connection to the billing<br>
server 34 to the consumer's computer 42. Once the consumer's computer 42 has<br>
received the transaction I.D. and the encrypted product, the consumer's computer 42<br>
disconnects from the Internet 20 and dials the telephone number transferred by the<br>
billing server 34 in order to obtain the access key for decrypting the product. Once<br>
the PPP connection with the billing server 34 is established, the consumer's<br>
computer 42 transfers the transaction I.D. back to the billing server 34 so that the<br>
billing server component 64 may identify the order and match the transaction I.D. to<br>
the access key assigned to that transaction. Accordingly, the billing server transfers<br>
the appropriate access key to the consumer's computer so that the plug-in 52 may<br>
decrypt the product. It is readily apparent from FIGURE 13 that the plug-in 52 is<br>
only able to decrypt the ordered product and thus, the consumer is only able to use<br>
the product, once the access key has been provided, which necessarily requires that<br>
the consumer's computer make a premium telephone call that is billed by the<br>
telephone service provider to the consumer's telephone service account.<br>
Ordering Premium Content<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, a consumer may order<br>
premium content provided by a merchant over the Internet 20 and be automatically<br>
billed for the amount of time the consumer spends accessing the content, rather than<br>
billed a unit rate or drop-charge for the premium content.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 14, a consumer may use a computer 42 installed with a<br>
Web browser 51 to visit a merchant's Web site and retrieve a hypertext document<br>
which may contain or be linked to content considered to have a monetary value to the<br>
merchant. For example, a consumer using computer 42 and Web browser 51 may<br>
retrieve the hypertext document shown in a main window 70 of FIGURE 14 from a<br>
merchant server 39. The consumer may order the premium content stored at that<br>
merchant's Web site, i.e., at merchant server 39, by selecting the automatic billing<br>
icon 68. As will be described in more detail below, if the consumer selects the<br>
automatic billing icon 68, the consumer will be billed automatically by its telephone<br>
service provider on his or her next monthly telephone bill for the time spent on a<br>
premium telephone line accessing the premium content retrieved from the merchant<br>
server 39.<br>
The logic implemented by the Web browser 51 installed on the client's<br>
computer 42 when the automatic billing icon 68 is selected is the same in the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention as the first, which was described above in<br>
connection with FIGURE 6. Briefly, in response to selection of the automatic billing<br>
icon 68, the Web browser 51 downloads a plug-in component 52' from the billing<br>
server 34 via the Internet 20 and installs the plug-in component 52' in memory 50 of<br>
the consumer's computer 42, if the plug-in component 52' has not already been<br>
installed on the consumer's computer 42. It will be appreciated, however, that the<br>
logic implemented by the plug-in component 52' in the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention is slightly different than that described above in connection with<br>
the first embodiment. Hence, the reference number (52) for the plug-in component in<br>
the second embodiment is denoted with a prime ""'.<br>
Once the plug-in 52' is initialized, the plug-in 52' performs the logic depicted<br>
in FIGURES 15A-15C to place the consumer's order for premium content<br>
information with the billing server 34 using methods well-known in the an. The<br>
logic begins in FIGURE 15A in a block. 240 and proceeds to a block 242 in which the<br>
consumer's computer 42 establishes an Internet connection to the billing server 34.<br>
Next, in a block 244, the plug-in 52' displays a premium content access window 280<br>
as shown in FIGURE 16A on the screen 73 of the consumer's computer 42. The<br>
premium content access window 280 confirms the consumer's order for premium<br>
content and provides the consumer with the opportunity to cancel the request. If the<br>
consumer enters "OK," the logic in FIGURE 15 A will proceed to a block 246 where<br>
the plug-in 52' transfers to the billing server 34 a product I.D. uniquely identifying<br>
the premium content desired by the consumer and a purchaser I.D. assigned to the<br>
consumer. As will be described in more detail below, the consumer is assigned a<br>
purchaser I.D. the first time it places an order with the billing server 34. Hence, if<br>
this is the first time that the consumer has placed an order, the consumer will not<br>
have been assigned a purchaser I.D. and no such I.D. will be transferred in block 246.<br>
However, in yet other embodiments of the present invention, the consumer may be<br>
assigned the purchaser I.D. when the plug-in 52' is downloaded, thus eliminating the<br>
need for the billing server 34 to supply it later. In addition to the product I.D. and the<br>
purchaser I.D., the plug-in transfers to the billing server 34 a merchant I.D. uniquely<br>
identifying the merchant providing the premium content and the advertised rate at<br>
which the consumer will be billed for accessing the content. It will be appreciated<br>
that the merchant I.D. and advertised rate are obtained directly from the merchant<br>
Web site used by the consumer to order the premium content.<br>
After transferring the purchaser I.D., product I.D., merchant I.D.. and<br>
advertised rate to the billing server 34, the plug-in 52' waits for the billing server 34<br>
to transfer to the consumer's computer 42 a transaction I.D. which identifies the<br>
consumer, the premium content ordered by the consumer (by product I.D.), and the<br>
billing server 34 processing the order (as noted above, there may be more than one<br>
billing server located elsewhere on the Internet 20). The consumer's computer 42<br>
also waits for the billing server 34 to transfer a premium access telephone number<br>
and the actual premium access rate at which the consumer will be billed (since it may<br>
differ from the advertised rate). It will be appreciated that the premium access<br>
telephone number is the premium rate telephone number that the consumer's<br>
computer uses to establish a point-to-point (PPP) connection to the billing server 34<br>
and the number by which the consumer is billed per minute (or other time interval)<br>
for accessing the premium content. As will be described in more detail below, once<br>
the PPP connection is established, the consumer is allowed to download the desired<br>
premium content from the merchant server 39 and billing at the actual premium rate<br>
begins.<br>
Once the transaction I.D., premium telephone number and actual premium<br>
rate are received by the plug-in 52', the plug-in 52' displays the premium content<br>
access window 280 as completed with the premium telephone number and actual<br>
premium rate received from the billing server 34 in a premium telephone number<br>
field 282 and a rate field 284, respectively, as shown in FIGURE 16B. Once the<br>
consumer depresses the OK button indicating his or her desire to continue with the<br>
order for premium content, the plug-in 52' disconnects the consumer's computer 42<br>
from the Internet 20 in a block 252 in FIGURE 15B. Next, in a block 254, the plug-<br>
in 52' supplies the premium telephone number provided by the billing server 34 to the<br>
modem 49 of the computer 42 and the modem dials the number in order to establish<br>
the PPP connection to the billing server 34. As described above, the premium<br>
telephone number provided by the billing server 34 and dialed by the modem 49 of<br>
the consumer's computer 42 in the present invention is a "900 number, " i.e., a<br>
ten-digit number with a 900 area code, assigned by the billing server's telephone<br>
service provider. As those of ordinary skill in the telephone switching arts will<br>
appreciate, the 900 area code has been generally reserved for commercial purposes,<br>
wherein the consumer is generally charged a flat rate, or a particular rate per minute<br>
for a telephone call, and a portion of that charge is paid by the telephone service<br>
provider to the merchant to whom the 900 number is assigned. It will be recognized,<br>
however, that other types of telephone numbers may be used and, in fact, mandated<br>
by the telephone service provider without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Returning to block 254, the CSTA monitor 36 is not necessary in the present<br>
embodiment of the invention to establish a PPP connection to the billing server 34.<br>
Instead, the premium telephone call placed by the modem 49 of the consumer's<br>
computer 42 is answered by the telephone switch 40 connected to the access<br>
server 38, which notifies the billing server 34 directly of the incoming call.<br>
Accordingly, the consumer's computer establishes a PPP connection with the billing<br>
server 34 via the telephone switch 40 and access server 38. It will be appreciated that<br>
once the PPP connection is established and the free period normally associated with<br>
the premium telephone number expires, billing begins by the telephone service<br>
provider using its own internal accounting and billing procedures. Accordingly, the<br>
plug-in 52' starts a premium access timer in block 256 for keeping track of the<br>
amount of time the consumer spends accessing the premium content and displays a<br>
timer window 290, as shown in FIGURE 16C on the screen 73 of the consumer's<br>
computer 42 which includes the amount of time spent by the consumer accessing the<br>
premium content, the premium rate at which the consumer is billed for viewing or<br>
accessing the premium content, and the total cost to the consumer calculated<br>
therefrom for accessing the premium content. Next, in a block 258, the plug-in 52'<br>
places the order for the premium content with billing server by transferring the<br>
previously assigned transaction I.D. to the billing server 34. It will be recognized<br>
that many consumers may be ordering premium content simultaneously, and hence,<br>
many computers located elsewhere on the Internet 20 may be establishing PPP<br>
connections to the billing server 34 at any given time. Therefore, the transaction I.D.<br>
is necessary so that the billing server 34 may identify consumer and the order placed<br>
by the consumer, and supply the plug-in 52' installed on the consumer's computer 42<br>
with the appropriate information for obtaining access to the premium content.<br>
After the transaction I.D. has been transferred to the billing server 34, the<br>
logic proceeds to a decision block 260 in which it determines if the consumer's<br>
computer 42 has received in return an access I.D., password and URL from the<br>
billing server 34. As will be described in more detail below, when the billing<br>
server 34 receives an order for premium content from the consumer's computer 42, it<br>
forwards the order to the merchant server 39 of the merchant providing the premium<br>
content ordered. In response, the merchant server 39 supplies the billing server 34<br>
with: (a) the URL for the premium content ordered; (b) a password allowing the<br>
consumer's computer to claim the ordered premium content and enter the merchant's<br>
premium Web site: and (c) an access I.D. that provides the consumer's computer 42<br>
with access to an Internet Protocol (IP) session with the merchant server 39. If this<br>
information has not yet been received from the billing server 34, the decision<br>
block 260 is merely repeated, i.e., the plug-in 52' merely waits, until the information<br>
is received. Once received, the plug-in 52' launches the Web browser 51 with the<br>
URL for the premium content already loaded in a block 262 and the consumer's<br>
computer establishes an Internet connection to the merchant server 39 identified by<br>
the loaded URL. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the<br>
Internet connection between the consumer's computer 42 and merchant server 39 is<br>
established via the billing server 34 and the access server 38 to which the billing<br>
server is connected. In other words, the LAN 24 serves as the consumer computer's<br>
gateway to the Internet 20. Once this connection is established, the consumer's<br>
computer 42 transfers to the merchant server 39 in a block 263 the password and<br>
access I.D. it has previously been given so that the merchant server 39 may allow the<br>
consumer's computer 42 access to the IP session the merchant server has designated<br>
for it. The consumer's computer 42 downloads the premium content located at the<br>
merchant's Web site, i.e., the merchant server 39, identified by the URL in a<br>
block 264 in FIGURE 15C.<br>
Billing continues at the premium rate as the consumer continues accessing the<br>
premium content and only terminates when the consumer chooses to disconnect from<br>
the merchant server 39 and billing server 34 by selecting a disconnect button 294 in<br>
the timer window 290 shown in FIGURE 16C. In this regard, the logic determines in<br>
a block 266 if the consumer has chosen the disconnect button 294. If so, the logic<br>
proceeds to a block 271 where the PPP connection to the billing server 34 via the<br>
premium telephone line is terminated, thus also ending the consumer computer's<br>
Internet connection with the merchant server 39. It will be appreciated that once the<br>
PPP connection is terminated, billing for the use of the premium telephone number<br>
ends as well. Accordingly, in a block 272 the premium access timer is terminated,<br>
and in a block 274, the plug-in 52' calculates the total cost to the consumer for<br>
accessing the premium content by multiplying the time spent by the consumer on the<br>
premium telephone line by the actual rate. The total cost is then displayed in the<br>
timer window 290 as shown in FIGURE 16C. Next, in a block 276 a termination<br>
window 296 as shown in FIGURE 16D is displayed to the consumer on the<br>
display 73 of the consumer's computer in a block 276. From the termination<br>
window 296, the consumer may choose to reconnect to the Internet 20 via its normal<br>
Internet service provider. The logic of the plug-in component 52' then ends in a<br>
block 278.<br>
Returning to decision block 266, if the consumer does not choose to<br>
disconnect from the billing server 34, the consumer may instead choose to create a<br>
bookmark to the premium Web site in case the consumer wishes to access the<br>
premium content again. If the consumer does choose to create a bookmark, a<br>
bookmark icon containing the URL for the merchant's premium Web site, the<br>
premium number associated with the premium content and the actual rate for the<br>
premium content is generated on the display of the consumer's computer for future<br>
use. If the consumer does not wish to create a bookmark or has already created a<br>
bookmark, the logic returns to block 264 so that the consumer may continue to access<br>
the premium content.<br>
It will be appreciated that the operation of the plug-in component 52' is<br>
slightly different if the consumer chooses to access the merchant's premium Web site<br>
via the created bookmark because the plug-in component will already have in its<br>
possession the premium phone number associated with the desired premium content<br>
and the actual rate for accessing the premium content. Consequently, it is<br>
unnecessary for the plug-in component to obtain that information from the billing<br>
server 34. The logic implemented by the plug-in component when a premium<br>
content bookmark is selected by the consumer is shown in more detail FIGURE 17<br>
and denoted hereafter as plug-in component 52". The logic begins in a block 300 and<br>
proceeds to a block 302 in which the consumer's computer 42 establishes an Internet<br>
connection to the billing server 34. Next, in a block 304, the plug-in 52" displays a<br>
premium content access window 310 as shown in FIGURE 18 on the screen 73 of the<br>
consumer's computer 42. The premium content access window 310 confirms the<br>
consumer's order for premium content, and displays the previously obtained premium<br>
telephone number and actual premium rate at which the consumer will be billed in<br>
fields 312 and 314. respectively. If the consumer enters "OK," the logic in<br>
FIGURE 17 will proceed to a block 306 where the plug-in 52" transfers to the billing<br>
server 34, the purchaser I.D., product I.D., merchant I.D. and actual rate. The<br>
consumer's computer then waits for the billing server 34 to return the transaction I.D.<br>
for the order in a decision block 308. Once received, the logic then proceeds to<br>
block 252 on FIGURE 15B such that the remaining logic shown in FIGURES 15B<br>
and 15C as described above in connection with plug-in component 52' is performed.<br>
Now that the logic implemented by the plug-in components 52' and 52" have<br>
been discussed, it is necessary to describe the billing server component 62'<br>
implemented by the billing server 34 to supply the consumer's computer with the<br>
information it will require to gain access to the premium content. It will be<br>
appreciated, however, that the logic implemented by the billing server component 62'<br>
in the second embodiment of the present invention is slightly different than that<br>
described above in connection with the first embodiment. Hence, the reference<br>
number (62) for the billing server component in the second embodiment is denoted<br>
with a prime "'". As shown in FIGURE 19, the logic implemented by the billing<br>
server component 62' to provide the premium telephone number begins in a<br>
block 320 and proceeds to a decision block 322 where it determines whether the<br>
connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the billing server 34 has been<br>
established via the Internet 20. If not, decision block 322 is merely repeated until<br>
such a connection has been established. Next, in a block 324, the billing server<br>
component 62' determines if the product I.D., merchant I.D., rate and purchaser I.D.<br>
have been received from the consumer's computer 42, if not, decision block 324 is<br>
repeated until such information has been received.<br>
Once the product I.D., merchant I.D., purchaser I.D. and rate have been<br>
received, the billing server component 62' determines if the consumer is new in a<br>
decision block 326, i.e., if this is the first time the consumer has placed an order for<br>
premium content. If this is the first time, the plug-in 52' will be unable to provide the<br>
billing server 34 with the purchaser I.D. for the consumer. Accordingly, the billing<br>
server component 62' assigns the consumer a purchaser I.D. in a block 328. As noted<br>
above, the plug-in 52' will return this purchaser I.D. each subsequent time the<br>
consumer places an order. The purchaser I.D. and merchant I.D. are logged in the<br>
product and information database 64 of the billing server 34 and used for accounting,<br>
reporting and recordkeeping purposes, such as payment histories, customer<br>
demographics, account reconciliation, etc.<br>
If the consumer is not a first-time buyer or, is a first-time buyer and thus, has<br>
been assigned a purchaser I.D., the logic proceeds to a decision block. 332, where the<br>
billing server component 62' determines whether an order by this particular consumer<br>
should be denied. More specifically, the billing server 34 determines whether the<br>
purchaser I.D. is valid. If not, the consumer placing the order is notified in a<br>
block 334 and the PPP connection between the billing server 34 and the consumer's<br>
computer 42 is disconnected in a block 336. The logic then ends in a block 338. On<br>
the other hand, if the purchaser I.D. is valid, the logic proceeds from decision<br>
block 332 to a block 340 where the billing server 34 assigns a transaction I.D. to the<br>
order and transfers the transaction I.D. to the consumer's computer 42. The<br>
transaction I.D. identifies the consumer, the product ordered (by product I.D.) and the<br>
billing server 34. As noted above, the plug-in 52' installed on the consumer's<br>
computer 42 waits for this transaction I.D. before disconnecting from the Internet 20<br>
and establishing a PPP connection with the billing server 34. The logic of<br>
FIGURE 19 then ends in a block 342.<br>
The logic employed by the billing server component 62' to obtain the<br>
information necessary for the consumer computer 42 to access the premium content<br>
from the merchant server 39 and provide the same to the consumer's computer 42 is<br>
depicted in FIGURES 20A-20B. The logic begins in FIGURE 20A in a block 350<br>
and proceeds to a decision block 352 where the billing server component 62<br>
determines if a PPP connection has been established to the billing server 34 by any<br>
consumer computer 42 installed with the plug-in 52'. As noted above, many<br>
consumers may be placing orders at any given time, and hence, many computers may<br>
be attempting to establish a PPP connection to the billing server 34 so that they may<br>
obtain access to the premium content they desire. Hence, decision block 352 is<br>
repeated until such a connection has been established.<br>
Once a PPP connection has been established, the logic proceeds to a decision<br>
block 354 where it determines if the billing server 34 has received the transaction I.D.<br>
from the consumer computer signaling that the consumer's computer is requesting<br>
access to premium content. If not, decision block 354 is merely repeated until such<br>
time as the transaction I.D. is received. Once received, the logic proceeds to a<br>
block 356 where the billing server obtains the Automated Number Identification<br>
(ANI) of the PPP connection between the billing server and the consumer's<br>
computer 42 from the access server 38. The ANI is logged by the billing server 34 in<br>
the product and information database 64 and is also used for accounting, reporting<br>
and recordkeeping procedures. In addition, the billing server obtains an Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) address that was assigned to the consumer's computer 42 by the access<br>
server 38 when the PPP connection was established. As will be described in more<br>
detail below, the billing server 34 will transfer the transaction I.D. and consumer<br>
computer IP address to the merchant server 39 in order to retrieve the access<br>
information desired bv the consumer.<br>
Next, in a block 358, the billing server component 62' confirms that the<br>
consumer's computer 42 has dialed the correct premium telephone number for the<br>
desired premium content. It will be appreciated, that the premium content is<br>
identified by the product I.D. and that each product I.D. is associated with a particular<br>
premium telephone number in the database of product and logged information 64<br>
stored in mass memory 64 of the billing server 34. Consequently, the billing server<br>
component 62" determines if the premium telephone number dialed by the<br>
consumer's computer to establish the current PPP connection matches the premium<br>
telephone number associated with the premium content (i.e., product I.D.) received<br>
from the consumer's computer in decision block 354. If the correct premium<br>
telephone number has been dialed, the logic will proceed from a decision block 360<br>
to a block 366 in which the merchant providing the ordered premium content is<br>
identified by the billing server 34. More specifically, each product I.D. identifying<br>
premium content is associated with a particular merchant, and this association is<br>
stored in the product and logged information database 67 of the billing server 34.<br>
Once the merchant has been identified in block 366, the billing server component 62'<br>
obtains the location of the merchant server 39 for the particular merchant server 39,<br>
i.e., the Internet Protocol (IP) address, which stores the premium content from the<br>
product and logged information database 67 in a block 368.<br>
Next, in a block 370 shown in FIGURE 20B, the billing server 34 establishes<br>
an Internet connection with the located merchant server 39 using the IP address<br>
obtained in block 368. Once the connection has been established, the billing server<br>
transfers the transaction I.D. and the IP address for the consumer's computer 42 to the<br>
merchant server 39 in a block 372. As will be described in more detail below, the<br>
merchant server 39 will send the billing server 34 the information necessary for the<br>
consumer computer 42 to access the premium content in response to the transaction<br>
I.D. received from the billing server 34. Accordingly, in a decision block 374 the<br>
logic determines if the billing server 34 has received an access I.D., password and<br>
URL for the premium content from the merchant server 39. If not, decision<br>
block 374 is merely repeated until such time as the billing server 34 receives this<br>
information. Once received, the billing server 34 forwards the access I.D., password<br>
and URL to the consumer's computer 42 in a block 376 so that the consumer's<br>
computer 42 may launch its Web browser 51 with the appropriate URL, establish an<br>
Internet connection to the merchant server 39 and provide the merchant server 36<br>
with the access I.D. necessary for accessing the IP session the merchant server 39 has<br>
designated for it, and the password necessary for gaining entry to the premium<br>
content. The logic then proceeds to decision block 378 where it determines if the<br>
consumer's computer 42 has terminated its PPP connection with the billing server 34.<br>
If not. decision block 378 is merely repeated until the PPP connection has been<br>
terminated. In other words, as long as the consumer computer 42 continues to<br>
download the premium content from the merchant server 39 and as long as the PPP<br>
connection between the computer 42 and the billing server 34 is maintained, the<br>
consumer will be billed at the actual rate supplied by the billing server 34 until the<br>
PPP connection established using the premium telephone number is terminated, i.e.,<br>
until the consumer "hangs up."<br>
Once the PPP connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the billing<br>
server 34 is terminated, the billing server 34 transfers to the merchant server 39 a<br>
request to deny the consumer computer 42 further access to the premium content,<br>
which includes the transaction I.D., the consumer computer's IP address and the<br>
access I.D. in a block 380. As will be described in more detail below, in response to<br>
this request, the merchant server 39 will deny further access to the consumer<br>
computer 42 until the consumer computer 42 re-orders the premium content and<br>
establishes a new PPP connection to the billing server 34 via a premium telephone<br>
line by which the consumer will be billed. Once the deny request is sent, the billing<br>
server 34 disconnects from the merchant server 39 in a block 381. The logic for the<br>
billing server component 62' then ends in a block 382.<br>
The logic implemented by the merchant session gateway component 65 to<br>
provide the billing server 34 with access information to the ordered premium content,<br>
is shown in more detail in FIGURE 21. The logic begins in a block 390 and proceeds<br>
to a block 392 where it determines if the direct Internet connection between the<br>
merchant server 39 and the billing server 34 has been established. If not, decision<br>
block 392 is merely repeated until such connection has been established. Once<br>
established, the logic proceeds to another decision block 394 in which the merchant<br>
session gateway component 65 determines if the merchant server 39 has received<br>
from the billing server 34 a transaction I.D. identifying the ordered premium content<br>
and the IP address assigned to the consumer computer 42. The consumer computer's<br>
IP address is logged in the product database 67 of the merchant server 39 and is used<br>
later by the merchant server 39 to verify that the merchant server 39 is transferring<br>
the ordered premium content to a valid IP address, i.e., to the appropriate consumer's<br>
computer.<br>
Returning to decision block 394, if the result is negative, decision block 394<br>
is repeated until such information is received from the billing server 34. In other<br>
words, once an Internet connection is made between the billing server 34 and<br>
merchant server 39, the merchant server 39 waits to receive a transaction I.D. for<br>
premium content from a billing server 34. Once received, the merchant session<br>
gateway component 65 transfers the URL for the ordered premium content, as well as<br>
an access I.D. and a password, to the billing server 34. It will be appreciated that in<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention described herein, each product I.D.<br>
is associated with a URL in the product database 67 of the merchant server 39. As<br>
noted above, the URL provides the location on the Internet of the premium content.<br>
It will be appreciated that the premium content may be located on the merchant<br>
server 39 implementing the present logic or on another merchant server located<br>
elsewhere on the Internet. As also noted above, the access I.D. identifies the IP<br>
session assigned by the merchant server 39 to which the consumer's computer 42 may<br>
have access so as to download the ordered premium content from the merchant<br>
server. Finally, the password is a unique string of characters that the consumer's<br>
computer 42 will eventually return to the merchant server 39 for approval to enter the<br>
premium content site.<br>
After the merchant server 39 transfers the URL, access I.D. and password to<br>
the billing server 34, the merchant session gateway component 65 waits for an<br>
indication from the billing server 34 that the consumer has ended the premium<br>
telephone call. Accordingly, in a decision block 398, the logic determines if the<br>
merchant server 39 has received a request from the billing server 34 to deny access to<br>
the consumer's computer 42. As noted above, when the billing server 34 detects that<br>
the consumer's computer has terminated the PPP connection with the billing server<br>
and disconnected from the premium telephone line, the billing server 34 transfers the<br>
transaction I.D., consumer computer's IP address and the access I.D. originally<br>
assigned by the merchant server, to the merchant server 39 in a request to deny<br>
further access to that consumer. Therefore, until such a request is received, the<br>
decision block 398 is merely repeated. It will be appreciated from the description<br>
above, that while the merchant session gateway component 65 waits for the<br>
consumer's computer 42 to terminate the premium telephone call, the merchant<br>
server 39 will transfer the premium content to the consumer's computer 42 (and such<br>
transfers will be governed by the Web server component 63 of the merchant<br>
server 39) and the consumer will continue to access the premium content while being<br>
billed. Further, as noted above, as the merchant server 39 transfers, and the<br>
consumer's computer 42 downloads, the ordered premium content, the merchant<br>
server 39 uses the consumer IP address stored in mass memory 61 and previously<br>
transferred by the billing server 34 to verify that it is transferring each page of the<br>
ordered premium content to the correct destination, i.e., that the IP address of the<br>
consumer's computer 42 downloading the premium content matches the consumer IP<br>
address the merchant server 39 has stored in its memory.<br>
Once the request to deny access is received, the merchant session gateway<br>
component 65 invalidates the access I.D. and consumer IP address previously given<br>
to the consumer's computer 42 so that the consumer's computer 42 can no longer gain<br>
access from .the assigned IP session with the merchant server 39. Consequently, the<br>
consumer's computer 42 can no longer communicate with the merchant server and<br>
can no longer access the premium content. The logic of the merchant session<br>
gateway component 65 then ends in a block 402.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that once the PPP<br>
connection between the consumer's computer 42 and the billing server 34 using a<br>
premium telephone line has been established, the telephone service provider begins<br>
billing the consumer for the duration of the premium telephone call using methods<br>
well known in the art. Once the consumer's computer terminates the PPP connection<br>
using the premium telephone number, i.e., "hangs-up," billing ceases, just as it would<br>
with any other premium telephone call. The telephone service provider then pays a<br>
service charge to the provider of the billing server 34, and pays the merchant its<br>
portion for providing the premium content.<br>
FIGURES 22A-22B are an overall diagram depicting the actions of the plug-<br>
in component 527consumer's computer 42, the billing server component 62Vbilling<br>
server 34, and merchant session gateway component 65/merchant server 39 in<br>
parallel. Consequently, FIGURE 22A depicts the consumer's computer 42<br>
establishing an Internet connection to the billing server 34. The consumer's<br>
computer 42 then transfers the product I.D. identifying the ordered premium content<br>
to the billing server 34 as well as a merchant I.D., advertised billing rate and<br>
purchaser I.D. In response, the billing server 34 transfers a transaction I.D.<br>
identifying the order back to the consumer's computer 42. The billing server 34 also<br>
transfers the premium telephone number associated with the ordered premium<br>
content and the actual premium rate at which the consumer will be billed for<br>
accessing the premium content. Once the consumer's computer 42 has received the<br>
transaction I.D. and premium telephone number, the consumer's computer 42<br>
disconnects from the Internet 20 and dials the premium telephone number transferred<br>
by the billing server 34 in order to establish a PPP connection with the billing<br>
server 34. Once established, billing for the consumer's time spent accessing the<br>
premium content begins and a consumer's computer 42 transfers the transaction I.D.<br>
back to the billing server 34 so that the billing server component 62' may identify the<br>
order and forward it to the appropriate merchant server 39.<br>
Accordingly, the billing server 34 establishes an Internet connection to the<br>
merchant server 39 and transfers the transaction I.D. and consumer computer's IP<br>
address to the merchant server 39. In response, the merchant server 39 transfers to<br>
the billing server 34 the access information, i.e., an access I.D.. password, and URL,<br>
which will be used by the consumer's computer 42 to locate and access the desired<br>
premium content. In turn, the billing server 34 transfers the access information to the<br>
consumer's computer 42. Once the consumer computer 42 receives the access<br>
information, the consumer's computer 42 is provided an Internet connection and<br>
locates the merchant server 39 and the premium content stored there using the URL.<br>
The consumer computer 42 then transfers the password and access I.D. it has been<br>
given to the merchant server 39. In response, the merchant server 39 transfers the<br>
ordered premium content to the consumer's computer 42. It will be appreciated that<br>
during such time, the consumer will continue to be billed for its time accessing the<br>
premium content because the PPP connection between the consumer's computer 42<br>
and billing server 34 on a premium telephone line is maintained. However, once the<br>
consumer's computer terminates the PPP connection, the billing ends and the billing<br>
server 39 transfers a request to deny access to the premium content to the merchant<br>
server 19 so that the merchant server 19 may deny future access to the premium<br>
content to the consumer's computer 42 (unless, of course, the consumer re-orders the<br>
premium content using the plug-in component 52' or 52", as described above). The<br>
billing sever 34 then terminates it Internet connection with the merchant server 39.<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated<br>
and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the billing<br>
system of the present invention may be used to order products that are not<br>
electronically stored and delivered. Rather, the products are delivered by some other<br>
method, e.g., postal service, express package service, etc. In such cases, instead of<br>
providing the plug-in 52 with an encrypted product and an access key for decrypting<br>
the encrypted product, the consumer is provided with an access key or claim number<br>
that must be presented upon delivery of the product so that the consumer may claim<br>
the product. The billing system of the present invention may also be used to order<br>
products that may be used by the consumer only for a predetermined time period.<br>
For example, the consumer may purchase an hour of computer game time. In such<br>
cases, the consumer is not allowed to begin play of the game until provided an access<br>
key. which is then returned to the computer game provider.<br>
