Method of Manufacturing Electric Resistance Welding Pipe<br>
Having Excellent Characterization of Welded Seam<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
manufacturing a pipe required to have toughness of weld such<br>
as line pipe for oil well, or a pipe required to have strength<br>
of weld such as casing for oil well.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, pipes are roughly classified into welding<br>
pipes and seamless pipes. An electric resistance welding pipe<br>
as one of the welding pipes is manufactured by curling a sheet<br>
by roll forming or the like, and then confronting each edge<br>
and welding. In the welding pipes, toughness and strength of<br>
weld are generally bad compared with those of a mother strip.<br>
In any case of using a pipe, it is a problem to insure toughness<br>
and strength of weld for each application.<br>
For example, since a line pipe for transporting crude<br>
oil or natural gas is often laid in the cold latitudes, low<br>
temperature toughness is essentially concerned. Moreover,<br>
strength is importantly concerned with a casing for protecting<br>
a mining pipe in an oil well for mining crude oil.<br>
Typically, a hot-rolled sheet (strip) to be a mother<br><br>
strip of an electric resistance welding pipe is designed in<br>
composition or subjected to heat treatment in consideration<br>
of properties of the mother strip after pipe manufacturing in<br>
order to secure properties of the mother strip such as toughness<br>
and strength.<br>
However, since characterization of welded seam is<br>
largely dependent on an electric resistance welding method<br>
compared with the composition design or heat treatment of the<br>
mother strip, improvement in welding technique is important.<br>
As a cause of defective electric resistance welding,<br>
oxides called penetrators are given, which are generated on<br>
an edge of a welding sheet material. In many cases, the<br>
penetrators are not discharged from the edge along with melting<br>
steel during electric resistance welding and remained thereon,<br>
and the remained penetrators cause reduction in toughness,<br>
leading to insufficient strength.<br>
Thus, to remove the penetrators from weld, earnest<br>
investigation has been made so far on an active discharging<br>
technique of melting steel from lateral edges of a strip to<br>
be welded in the weld. For example, patent document 1 or patent<br>
document 2 describes an example of investigation on a shape<br>
of each lateral edge of the strip. In the example, it is<br>
intended that the lateral edge of the strip, which is typically<br>
formed in an approximately rectangular shape by slitting or<br>
edge shaving, is processed in shape before electric resistance<br><br>
welding is performed such that the processed shape of the<br>
lateral edge improves discharge of melting steel during welding.<br>
This is summarized as follows.<br>
That is, a basic manufacturing line of the electric<br>
resistance welding pipe is as shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
manufacturing line of the electric resistance welding pipe has<br>
a configuration where a strip 10 is uncoiled from an uncoiler<br>
1; then the strip is reformed to be flat by a leveler 2; then<br>
the strip 10 is gradually rounded by a roll forming machine<br>
4; then right and left, two lateral edges of the rounded strip<br>
10 are welded by electric resistance welding using an electric<br>
resistance welder including an induction heating section 5 and<br>
a squeeze roll (electric resistance welding section) 6 so that<br>
the strip is formed into a pipe 30; then a weld bead portion<br>
of the pipe 30 is cut by a bead cutter 7; then the pipe 30 after<br>
cutting is adjusted in outer diameter by a sizer 8; and then<br>
the pipe is cut out into a predetermined length by a pipe cutter<br>
9. The roll forming machine 4 has a predetermined number of<br>
finpass forming stands 3 that constrain a strip edge that has<br>
been rounded in a last stage to shape it into an approximate<br>
round, the stand 3 including a first stand 3a and a second stand<br>
3b herein.<br>
In the technique described in the patent document 1, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5A showing a cross section diagram and Fig. 5B<br>
showing a partial detail diagram thereof, in the finpass<br><br>
forming first-stand 3a, a part of a lateral edge of the strip<br>
10	formed into the pipe shape is contacted to a fin of a finpass<br>
hole-shape roll so as to shape tapering on a lateral edge to<br>
be an edge at an inner surface side of the pipe as shown in<br>
Fig. 5C, and as shown in Fig. 5D showing a cross section diagram<br>
and Fig. 5E showing a partial detail diagram thereof, in the<br>
finpass forming second-stand 3b, another part of the lateral<br>
edge of the strip 10 is contacted to the fin so as to shape<br>
tapering on a lateral edge to be an edge at an outer surface<br>
side of the pipe as shown in Fig. 5F, and thus an X-groove is<br>
formed. An angle of a fin of each of the finpass forming<br>
first-stand 3a and the finpass forming second-stand 3b is a<br>
typical one angle.<br>
In the technique described in the patent document 2, as<br>
shown in Fig. 6A showing a cross section diagram, an edger roll<br>
11	is arranged at an upstream side of a finpass forming stand,<br>
and the edger roll 11 is used to reduce a lateral edge of the<br>
strip 10 formed into the pipe shape so as to shape tapering<br>
on the lateral edge of the strip 10 as a whole as shown in Fig.<br>
6B, and as shown in Fig. 6C showing a cross section diagram<br>
and Fig. 5D showing a partial detail diagram thereof, in a<br>
finpass forming stand 3, a part of the lateral edge of the strip<br>
10 is contacted to a fin of a finpass hole-shape roll, thereby<br>
a lateral edge to be an edge at an outer surface side of the<br>
6E<br>
pipe is shaped to be a vertical surface as shown in Fig. 6E.<br><br>
Patent documents 3 to 5 describe examples of investigating a<br>
shape of a strip edge. That is, it is intended that a strip<br>
edge, which is typically formed in an approximately rectangular<br>
shape by slitting or edge shaving, is tapered before roll<br>
forming such that the processed edge shape improves discharge<br>
of melting steel during welding.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
However, the inventors investigated the method described<br>
in the patent document 1, as a result, they found that even<br>
if the amount of upset in finpass forming was greatly changed,<br>
it was significantly difficult to contact only a part of the<br>
lateral edge of the strip 10 to the fin of the finpass hole-shape<br>
roll. This is because since the lateral edge of the strip 10<br>
was slightly work-hardened in a previous forming process, the<br>
whole lateral edge of the strip is easily deformed along the<br>
fin so as to perfectly fill the fin portion, consequently a<br>
shape of the fin is printed to the lateral edge of the strip.<br>
As a result, the lateral edge of the strip 10 is not in a desired<br>
shape immediately before electric resistance welding is<br>
performed, and in an extreme case, the lateral edge is in a<br><br>
flat shape having a slope at only one side.<br>
Moreover, the inventors investigated the method<br>
described in the patent document 2, as a result, they confirmed<br>
the following. That is, to shape tapering to the whole lateral<br>
edge of the strip 10 using the edger roll 11 during roll forming<br>
(at the upstream side of the finpass forming stand) , since the<br>
edger roll, of which the diameter is gradually increased from<br>
a pipe outer-surface side to a pipe inner-surface side, needs<br>
to be used for forming as described in the patent document 2,<br>
a lateral edge to be an edge at the pipe inner-surface side<br>
is shaved by the edger roll, which may problematically induce<br>
pads called "whisker". Furthermore, since large reaction<br>
force that opens the pipe-shaped strip 10 outward is exerted<br>
in a cross section direction of the strip 10 to be subjected<br>
to roll forming, pressure between the edger roll 11 and the<br>
lateral edge of the strip 10 is necessarily reduced. As a<br>
result, as in the patent document 1, the strip is hardly<br>
work-hardened through reduction of the lateral edge by the<br>
edger roll, and even if the amount of upset is reduced in<br>
subsequent finpass forming, the strip substantially fills the<br>
fin portion, therefore it is difficult that the lateral edge<br>
of the strip 10 is shaped as described in the patent document<br>
2, consequently the tapering is completely eliminated, and the<br>
edge becomes flat.<br>
The invention was made in the light of the above<br><br>
circumstance, and an object of the invention is to provide a<br>
method of manufacturing an electric resistance welding pipe,<br>
in which a lateral edge shape can be made into an appropriate<br>
shape immediately before electric resistance welding is<br>
performed, thereby melting steel is sufficiently discharged<br>
during electric resistance welding so that penetrators are<br>
securely removed, consequently an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe having excellent characterization of welded seam can be<br>
obtained.<br>
As described before, in the prior art described in the<br>
patent document 1 or 2, a part of the lateral edge of the strip<br>
is pressed against the fin of the finpass hole-shape roll to<br>
shape the tapering to the lateral edge of the strip. However,<br>
according to the investigation, the inventors understood that<br>
even if the finpass hole-shape roll was not wholly filled with<br>
the strip in a circumferential direction, when the strip was<br>
loaded into the finpass hole-shape roll, the lateral edge was<br>
highly pressurized by the fin, so that the fin portion was<br>
perfectly filled with the lateral edge. That is, they<br>
understood that when the strip was loaded into the finpass<br>
hole-shape roll, a lateral edge portion of the strip being<br>
contacted to the fin and a laterally central portion of the<br>
strip (portion of a bottom of the pipe-shaped strip) situated<br>
approximately 180 degrees opposite to the lateral edge portion<br>
were in a beam deflection condition, so that reaction force<br><br>
of the strip that acted to bend the cross section of the<br>
pipe-shaped strip into an arcuate shape was greatly exerted,<br>
consequently even if the strip did not fill the finpass<br>
hole-shape roll, large compression force was exerted on the<br>
lateral edge of the strip in the circumferential direction,<br>
as a result, the lateral edge of the strip was<br>
highly-pressurized by the fin, and consequently a shape of the<br>
fin was directly printed to the lateral edge of the strip.<br>
Thus, the inventors noticed a phenomenon that the lateral<br>
edge of the strip was highly-pressurized by the fin in the<br>
finpass forming, and conceived a method of shaping the<br>
predetermined tapering on the lateral edge of the strip by<br>
actively using the phenomenon. That is, they found that when<br>
the fin was shaped with two or more stages of tapering, even<br>
if the amount of upset in finpass forming was small, the lateral<br>
edge of the strip was able to be shaped with desired tapering,<br>
thereby the lateral edge of the strip was able to be shaped<br>
with appropriate tapering immediately before electric<br>
resistance welding was performed.<br>
Moreover, the patent document 5 discloses various<br>
chamfer shapes that facilitate adjustment of confronting<br>
pressure. However, it does not make any description on a point<br>
of discharging penetrators along with melting steel, and a<br>
point of improving characterization of welded seam<br>
(particularly low temperature toughness) by such penetrator<br><br>
discharging. Therefore, it is completely unclear that which<br>
shape may improve the characterization of welded seam<br>
(particularly low temperature toughness) among the various<br>
chamfer shapes disclosed therein.<br>

has the following features.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described<br>
according to drawings.<br>
A manufacturing line of an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe used in the invention is as shown in the Fig. 1. That<br>
is, the manufacturing line of an electric resistance welding<br>
pipe has a configuration where a strip 10 is uncoiled from an<br>
uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed to be flat by a leveler<br>
2; then the strip 10 is gradually rounded by a roll forming<br>
machine 4; then right and left, two lateral edges of the rounded<br>
strip 10 are welded by electric resistance welding using an<br>
electric resistance welder including an induction heating<br>
section 5 and a squeeze roll (electric resistance welding<br>
13<br><br>
section) 6 so that the strip is formed into a pipe 30; then<br>
a weld bead portion of the pipe 30 is cut by a bead cutter 7;<br>
then the pipe 30 after cutting is adjusted in outer diameter<br>
by a sizer 8; and then the pipe is cut out into a predetermined<br>
length by a pipe cutter 9. The roll forming machine 4 has a<br>
predetermined number of finpass forming stands 3 that constrain<br>
a sheet edge that has been rounded in a last stage to be into<br>
an approximate round shape, the stand 3 including a first stand<br>
3a and a second stand 3b herein.<br>
In the first embodiment, while a fin of the finpass<br>
forming first-stand 3a has typical one-stage tapering, as shown<br>
in Fig. 2A showing a cross section diagram and Fig. 2B showing<br>
a partial detail diagram thereof, a fin of the second-stage<br>
stand 3b has two-stage tapering (second-stage tapering angle<br>
is a, and second-stage slope vertical-length is β) , and such<br>
a shape is printed to right and left, two lateral edges of the<br>
strip 10, thereby as shown in Fig. 2C, right and left, two<br>
lateral edges at a side to be an outer surface side of a pipe<br>
are shaped with the predetermined tapering (a slope angle from<br>
a lateral edge to a surface to be the outer surface of the pipe<br>
is a, and a distance in a thickness direction between a start<br>
position on the lateral edge and the surface to be the outer<br>
surface of the pipe is (3) .<br>
The tapering shaped on the right and left, two lateral<br>
edges of the strip 10 is made such that the slope angle a from<br>
14<br><br>
the lateral edge of the strip 10 to the surface to be the outer<br>
surface of the pipe is 25° to 50°, and the distance β in a<br>
thickness direction of the strip between the tapering start<br>
position on the lateral edge and the surface to be the outer<br>
surface of the pipe is 20% to 40% of strip thickness.<br>
This is because when the slope angle a is less than 25°,<br>
melting steel is insufficiently discharged from the central<br>
portion in thickness of the strip, and penetrators are<br>
defectively remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or<br>
strength after electric resistance welding is finished, and<br>
when the slope angle a is more than 50°, the tapering is<br>
problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe even after<br>
electric resistance welding is finished. Moreover, when the<br>
tapering start distance β is less than 20% of thickness, melting<br>
steel is insufficiently discharged from the central portion<br>
in thickness, so that the penetrators tend to be remained, and<br>
when the tapering start distance P is more than 40% of thickness,<br>
the tapering is problematically remained as a flaw on a product<br>
pipe even after electric resistance welding is finished.<br>
As described above, in the embodiment, the fin shape of<br>
the finpass forming end stand 3b is made to be the shape having<br>
two angles, and the fin shape is printed to the right and left,<br>
two lateral edges of the strip 10, therefore a shape of each<br>
lateral edge of the strip 10 can be shaped with appropriate<br>
tapering immediately before electric resistance welding is<br>
15<br><br>
performed. As a result, the melting steel is sufficiently<br>
discharged during electric resistance welding, and the<br>
penetrators are securely removed, and consequently an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seam can be obtained.<br>
In the above, right and left, two lateral edges at a side<br>
to be an inner circumferential surface side of the pipe can<br>
be also shaped with predetermined tapering by changing a shape<br>
of the two-stage tapering.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, while a fin of<br>
the finpass forming first-stand 3a has typical one-stage<br>
tapering, as shown in Fig. 3A showing a cross section diagram<br>
and Fig. 3B showing a partial detail diagram thereof, a fin<br>
of the second stand 3b has three-stage tapering (first-stage<br>
slope vertical-length is 8, second-stage tapering angle is y,<br>
third-stage tapering angle is a, and third-stage slope<br>
vertical-length is (3) , and such a shape is printed to right<br>
and left, two lateral edges of the strip 10, thereby as shown<br>
in Fig. 3C, right and left, two lateral edges at a side to be<br>
an outer surface side of a pipe are shaped with predetermined<br>
tapering (a slope angle from a lateral edge to a surface to<br>
be the outer surface of the pipe is a, and a distance in a<br>
thickness direction between a start position on the lateral<br>
edge and the surface to be the outer surface of the pipe is<br>
P), and right and left, two lateral edges at a side to be an<br>
16<br><br>
inner surface side of the pipe are shaped with predetermined<br>
tapering (a slope angle from a lateral edge to a surface to<br>
be the inner surface of the pipe is y, and a distance in a<br>
thickness direction between a start position on the lateral<br>
edge and the surface to be the inner surface of the pipe is<br>
φ) . However, when one of angles of the three-stage fin is<br>
larger than an angle of a finpass roll in a vertical direction,<br>
a lateral edge of the strip is shaved by the fin, which may<br>
induce pads called "whisker", resulting in generation of a flaw<br>
during finpass forming, or causing spark in electric resistance<br>
welding. Therefore, the fin angle is preferably not more than<br>
the angle of the finpass roll in the vertical direction.<br>
The tapering shaped on the right and left, two lateral<br>
edges of the strip 10 is made such that the slope angle a from<br>
the lateral edge of the strip 10 to the surface to be the outer<br>
surface of the pipe, and the slope angle γ from the lateral<br>
edge to the surface to be the inner surface of the pipe are<br>
25° to 50° respectively, and the distance β in the thickness<br>
direction of the strip between the tapering start position on<br>
the lateral edge and the surface to be the outer surface of<br>
the pipe, and the distance φ in the vertical direction of the<br>
strip between the tapering start position and the surface to<br>
be the inner surface of the pipe are 20% to 40% of strip thickness<br>
respectively.<br>
This is because when the slope angle a or y is less than<br>
17<br><br>
25°, melting steel is insufficiently discharged from the<br>
central portion in thickness of the strip, and penetrators are<br>
defectively remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or<br>
strength after electric resistance welding is finished, and<br>
when the slope angle a or y is more than 50 degrees, the tapering<br>
is still problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe<br>
even after electric resistance welding is finished. Moreover,<br>
when the tapering start distance β or φ is less than 20% of<br>
thickness, melting steel is insufficiently discharged from the<br>
central portion in thickness, so that the penetrators tend to<br>
be remained, and when the tapering start distance β or φ is<br>
more than 40% of thickness, the tapering is still<br>
problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe after<br>
electric resistance welding is finished.<br>
As described above, in the embodiment, the fin shape of<br>
the finpass forming end stand 3b is made to be the shape having<br>
three angles, and the fin shape is printed to the right and<br>
left, two lateral edges of the strip 10, therefore a shape of<br>
each lateral edge of the strip 10 can be shaped with appropriate<br>
tapering immediately before electric resistance welding is<br>
performed. As a result, the melting steel is sufficiently<br>
discharged during electric resistance welding, and the<br>
penetrators are securely removed, and consequently an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seam can be obtained.<br>
18<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, as shown<br>
in Fig. 4A showing a cross section diagram and Fig. 4B showing<br>
a partial detail diagram thereof, a fin of the finpass forming<br>
first-stand 3a in a former stage has two-stage tapering<br>
(f irst-stage slope vertical-length 8 and second-stage tapering<br>
angle γ), and such a shape is printed to right and left, two<br>
lateral edges of the strip 10, thereby as shown in Fig. 4C,<br>
right and left, two lateral edges at a side to be an inner surface<br>
side of a pipe are shaped with predetermined tapering (a slope<br>
angle from a lateral edge to a surface to be the inner surface<br>
of the pipe is γ, and a distance in a thickness direction between<br>
a start position on the lateral edge and the surface to be the<br>
inner surface of the pipe is φ) . In addition, as shown in Fig.<br>
4D showing a cross section diagram and Fig. 4E showing a partial<br>
detail diagram thereof, a fin of the finpass forming<br>
second-stand 3b in a latter stage has two-stage tapering<br>
(second-stage tapering angle is a and second-stage slope<br>
vertical-length is β) , and such a shape is printed to right<br>
and left, two lateral edges of the strip 10, thereby as shown<br>
in Fig. 4F, right and left, two lateral edges at a side to be<br>
an outer surface side of the pipe are shaped with predetermined<br>
tapering (a slope angle from the lateral edge to a surface to<br>
be the outer surface of the pipe is a, and a distance in a<br>
thickness direction between a start position on the lateral<br>
edge and a surface to be the outer surface of the pipe is β).<br>
19<br><br>
When each lateral edge to be the inner surface of the<br>
pipe are shaped with the tapering by the finpass forming<br>
first-stand 3a, the shaped portion is significantly<br>
work-hardened by high pressure, therefore even if the lateral<br>
edge is further shaped with tapering by the finpass forming<br>
second-stand 3b, the tapering shaped by the first stand 3a is<br>
relatively not crushed. Therefore, the lateral edges of the<br>
strip can be shaped with the predetermined tapering in both<br>
the inner and outer surface sides of the pipe after finpass<br>
forming is finished.<br>
The tapering shaped on the right and left, two lateral<br>
edges of the strip 10 is made such that the slope angle a from<br>
the lateral edge of the strip 10 to the surface to be the outer<br>
surface of the pipe, and the slope angle γ from the lateral<br>
edge to the surface to be the inner surface of the pipe are<br>
25° to 50° respectively, and the distance β in a thickness<br>
direction of the strip between the tapering start position on<br>
the lateral edge and the surface to be the outer surface of<br>
the pipe, and the distance φ in a thickness direction of the<br>
strip between the tapering start position and the surface to<br>
be the inner surface of the pipe are 20% to 40% of strip thickness<br>
respectively.<br>
This is because when the slope angle a or y is less than<br>
25°, melting steel is insufficiently discharged from the<br>
central portion in thickness of the strip, and penetrators are<br>
20<br><br>
defectively remained, resulting in reduction in toughness or<br>
strength after electric resistance welding is finished, and<br>
when the slope angle a or y is more than 50 degrees, the tapering<br>
is still problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe<br>
even after electric resistance welding is finished. Moreover,<br>
when the tapering start distance β or φ is less than 20% of<br>
thickness, the melting steel is insufficiently discharged from<br>
the central portion in thickness, and the penetrators tend to<br>
be remained, and when the tapering start distance (3 or φ is<br>
more than 40% of thickness, the tapering is still<br>
problematically remained as a flaw on a product pipe after<br>
electric resistance welding is finished.<br>
As described above, in the embodiment, finpass is<br>
performed such that the fin shape of the first stand 3a in the<br>
former stage and the fin shape of the second stand 3b in the<br>
latter stage are made to be the shape having two angles<br>
respectively, and each of the fin shapes is printed to the right<br>
and left, two lateral edges of the strip 10, therefore a shape<br>
of the lateral edge of the strip 10 can be shaped with<br>
appropriate tapering immediately before electric resistance<br>
welding is performed. As a result, the melting steel is<br>
sufficiently discharged during electric resistance welding,<br>
and the penetrators are securely removed, and consequently an<br>
electric resistance welding pipe having excellent<br>
characterization of welded seam can be obtained.<br>
21<br><br>
In the first to third embodiments, the reason why the<br>
lateral edges at the pipe outer-surface side and/or the pipe<br>
inner -surface side of the strip are shaped with the tapering<br>
by the finpass forming end stand (second-stand 3b herein) is<br>
because since electric resistance welding is performed<br>
immediately after that, electric resistance welding can be<br>
performed while keeping excellent tapering. However, it is<br>
also acceptable that the lateral edges of the strip are shaped<br>
with tapering by a finpass forming start stand or finpass<br>
forming middle stand, but not shaped with tapering by the<br>
finpass forming end stand. Once the lateral edges of the strip<br>
are shaped with the tapering, the lateral edges are<br>
significantly work-hardened by high pressure, therefore even<br>
if the lateral edges are subjected to finpass forming<br>
thereafter, the tapering is relatively hardly crushed, and<br>
consequently a state where the lateral edges are shaped with<br>
the tapering can be kept even after finpass forming is finished.<br>
Moreover, in the invention, since only the finpass<br>
forming is used as means for shaping the tapering, equipment<br>
such as the edger roll or shaving roll is not necessary,<br>
therefore an exchange of a roll or a shaving stone for them<br>
is not necessary, and consequently an electric resistance<br>
welding pipe having excellent welding quality can be<br>
efficiently manufactured.<br>
Here, in this method of shaping the tapering in terms<br>
22<br><br>
of finpass forming, it is sometimes difficult to improve<br>
toughness or strength of weld after electric resistance welding<br>
is finished.<br>
With investigating the reason for this in detail, in a<br>
stage that a strip edge is heated before pressure welding<br>
(upset) in electric resistance welding, oxides, which are to<br>
be a cause of the penetrators as a welding defect, may be formed<br>
on the strip edge. The oxides float on a surface of melting<br>
steel, which is melted in a stage of melting each strip edge,<br>
and partially discharged along with the melting steel in a stage<br>
of pressure welding. At this time, if the strip edge is shaped<br>
with the tapering, the melting steel is easily discharged, in<br>
addition, the penetrator can be effectively discharged.<br>
However, since the oxides on the strip edge being a source<br>
of the penetrators are increasingly generated with heating of<br>
electric resistance welding, the following case has sometimes<br>
occurred in some welding condition: toughness or strength after<br>
welding cannot be sufficiently improved only by shaping the<br>
tapering on the strip edge.<br>
Thus, the inventors observed the phenomenon of electric<br>
resistance welding in detail again, as a result, they noticed<br>
generation of the oxides being the cause of penetrators. That<br>
is, they investigated not only discharge of penetrators by<br>
shaping the tapering on the strip edge, but also a method of<br>
preventing generation of the oxides being the cause of the<br>
23<br><br>
penetrators.<br>
As a result, the inventors understood that when<br>
non-oxidizing gas was blown to each strip edge under heating<br>
of electric resistance welding (that is, heating for melting<br>
edges to be pressure-welded before pressure welding),<br>
generation of the oxides was able to be suppressed. Here, the<br>
non-oxidizing gas means non-active gas (nitrogen gas, helium<br>
gas, argon gas, neon gas, xenon gas and the like, or mixed gas<br>
formed by mixing at least two of them), deoxidation gas<br>
(hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide gas, methane gas, propane gas<br>
and the like, or mixed gas formed by mixing at least two of<br>
them), or mixed gas formed by mixing the non-active gas and<br>
the deoxidation gas.<br>
That is, in the invention, each strip edge is previously<br>
shaped with tapering before electric resistance welding is<br>
performed, thereby discharge of the penetrator is accelerated,<br>
in addition, the non-oxidizing gas is blown to the strip edge<br>
under heating during electric resistance welding, thereby<br>
generation of the oxides as a cause of the penetrators is<br>
suppressed. This can securely improve toughness or strength<br>
of weld compared with a prior-art level. However, when the<br>
non-oxidizing gas is simply blown, the effect of suppressing<br>
generation of the oxides on the strip edge is reduced more or<br>
less because peripheral air is sucked. Thus, the peripheral<br>
air is preferably prevented from being sucked. To this end,<br>
24<br><br>
the strip edge under heating of electric resistance welding<br>
is preferably enclosed so that the inside of such enclosure<br>
is kept in a non-oxidizing gas atmosphere.<br>
In those kinds of non-oxidizing gas, a gas containing<br>
the deoxidation gas is more preferably used, because the effect<br>
of suppressing generation of the oxides as a cause of the<br>
penetrators is further enhanced, and consequently toughness<br>
or strength of weld can be more significantly improved.<br>
In the point of availability and cost reduction, the<br>
following gas is preferably used as the non-oxidizing gas.<br>
•	In the case of single use of non-active gas: (A) either of<br>
nitrogen gas, helium gas, and argon gas, or mixed gas of at<br>
least two of them.<br>
•	In the case of single use of deoxidation gas: (B) one of<br>
hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas, or mixed gas of the two.<br>
•	In the case of using mixed gas of non-active gas and<br>
deoxidation gas: mixed gas of the above (A) and (B). It is<br>
obvious that particularly when a gas containing hydrogen gas<br>
and/or carbon monoxide gas is used, a thorough safety measure<br>
should be taken.<br>
Moreover, to cope with the problem, the inventors<br>
observed an electric resistance welding phenomenon in detail<br>
again, as a result, they noticed a confronting angle between<br>
two edges in a strip width direction (angle between vertical<br>
surfaces of two edges in a strip width direction) in electric<br>
25<br><br>
resistance welding. That is, they found that the confronting<br>
angle between the vertical surfaces being not shaped with<br>
tapering is also much concerned with effective discharge of<br>
the penetrators along with the melting steel, in addition to<br>
shaping the tapering on each strip edge.<br>
In electric resistance welding, when the confronting<br>
angle between the vertical surfaces of the edges of the strip<br>
(vertical edges of the strip) is changed, a discharge mode of<br>
the melting steel is varied. That is, when the confronting<br>
angle is set so as to be opened to a pipe outer-surface side,<br>
each strip edge shaped with the tapering is behaved such that<br>
a pipe inner-surface side is preferentially heated so that<br>
melting steel is first generated therein, and the melting steel<br>
is gradually pushed out to the pipe outer-surface side as each<br>
strip edge is increasingly confronted during electric<br>
resistance welding. When the confronting angle is set so as<br>
to be opened to the pipe inner-surface side, each strip edge<br>
shaped with the tapering is behaved such that the pipe<br>
outer-surface side is preferentially heated so that melting<br>
steel is first generated therein, and the melting steel is<br>
gradually pushed out to the pipe inner-surface side as each<br>
strip edge is increasingly confronted during electric<br>
resistance welding.<br>
At this time, for example, when it is assumed that the<br>
confronting angle to be opened to the pipe outer-surface side<br>
26<br><br>
is positive, and the confronting angle to be opened to the pipe<br>
inner-surface side is negative, if the confronting angle is<br>
large, more than +1° or less than -1°, since a strip edge at<br>
one side is preferentially melted and thus the amount of melting<br>
steel to be flowed to a strip edge at an opposite side is<br>
significantly increased, the melting steel cannot be<br>
sufficiently discharged within a welding period before<br>
confronting is completed, consequently electric resistance<br>
welding is completed while the melting steel is still confined<br>
within the strip. As a result, penetrators, which aggregate<br>
into the melting steel or onto a surface thereof, are left<br>
within the strip, resulting in significant reduction in<br>
toughness or strength of electric resistance weld. From the<br>
above, the confronting angle of the vertical surfaces between<br>
the edges of the strip in electric resistance welding needs<br>
to be within ±1° (-1° to +1°).<br>
At that time, when each strip edge is previously shaped<br>
with tapering, the melting amount of one edge that is first<br>
melted is decreased by amount corresponding to such decreased<br>
volume, and the edge is melted along the tapering, so that<br>
melting steel is further decreased, therefore the penetrators<br>
can be sufficiently discharged from the electric resistance<br>
weld by both effects of the confronting angle and the tapering,<br>
leading to significant improvement in toughness and strength.<br>
An embodiment of the invention as above is described<br>
27<br><br>
below.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a manufacturing line of an<br>
electric resistance welding pipe used in an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The manufacturing line of the electric resistance<br>
welding pipe has a basic configuration where a sheet (strip)<br>
10 is uncoiled from an uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed<br>
to be flat by a leveler 2; then the strip 10 is gradually rounded<br>
by a roll forming machine 4; then right and left, two lateral<br>
edges of a strip 20 that was rounded into a pipe shape are welded<br>
by electric resistance welding using an electric resistance<br>
welder including an induction heating section 5 and a squeeze<br>
roll (electric resistance welding section) 6 so that the strip<br>
is formed into a pipe 30; then a weld bead portion of the pipe<br>
30 is cut by a bead cutter 7; then the pipe 30 after cutting<br>
is adjusted in outer diameter by a sizer 8; and then the pipe<br>
30 is cut out into a predetermined length by a pipe cutter 9.<br>
In the embodiment, the roll forming machine 4 has a<br>
finpass forming stand 3 including a plurality of stands (for<br>
example, three stands) in a last stage, and as described before,<br>
a fin of each stand is formed into an appropriate shape, thereby<br>
a top side of each strip edge (inner surface side of the pipe)<br>
and/or a bottom side of each strip edge (outer surface side<br>
of the pipe) can be shaped with predetermined tapering.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 2A showing a cross section<br>
diagram and Fig. 2B showing a partial detail diagram thereof,<br>
28<br><br>
an optional stand of the finpass forming stand 3 has a fin shape<br>
of predetermined two-stage tapering (second-stage tapering<br>
angle is a, and second-stage slope vertical-length is β) . Such<br>
a fin shape is printed to lateral edges of the strip 10, thereby<br>
right and left, two lateral edges at the bottom side of the<br>
strip 10 (outer surface side of the pipe) are shaped with the<br>
tapering having a tapering angle of a and a tapering height<br>
of β.<br>
In the above way, the pipe-shaped strip 20, which is<br>
shaped with the tapering having a tapering angle of a and a<br>
tapering height of β at the outer surface side, and shaped with<br>
the tapering having a tapering angle of γ and a tapering height<br>
of 8 at the inner surface side, is set such that a confronting<br>
angle 0 between vertical surfaces of the edges of the strip<br>
is from -1° to +1° for electric resistance welding as shown in<br>
Fig. 9.<br>
Thus, the penetrators can be sufficiently discharged<br>
from the electric resistance weld, consequently an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having highly excellent toughness and<br>
strength can be obtained.<br>
Moreover, to cope with the problem, the inventors<br>
observed an electric resistance welding phenomenon in detail<br>
again, as a result, they noticed an apex angle in V-shape (vee<br>
angle) formed in a longitudinal direction by two edges in a<br>
strip width direction immediately before electric resistance<br>
29<br><br>
welding was performed. That is, they found that the vee angle<br>
is also much concerned with effective discharge of penetrators<br>
along with the melting steel, in addition to shaping the<br>
tapering on each strip edge.<br>
In electric resistance welding, when the vee angle shaped<br>
by each strip edge is changed, a generation/discharge mode of<br>
the melting steel is varied. That is, when the vee angle is<br>
smaller, the strip edge is started to be heated at a point<br>
distant from weld, and as a heating point approaches the weld,<br>
the strip edge is gradually increased in temperature, and<br>
heating is gradually spread from upper and lower parts in<br>
thickness to a central portion in thickness of the strip edge.<br>
While melting steel is gradually generated with progress of<br>
the phenomena, solidification starts before melting steel<br>
generated in the upper part in thickness (pipe outer-surface<br>
side) and the lower part in thickness (pipe inner-surface side)<br>
of the strip edge arrives at the weld, therefore melting steel<br>
in the central portion in thickness is hard to be discharged<br>
to the outside. As a result, penetrators generated with the<br>
molten steel also tend to be remained within the strip, leading<br>
to significant reduction in toughness or strength of electric<br>
resistance weld.<br>
Thus, the inventors earnestly investigated the vee angle,<br>
as a result, they understood that if the vee angle is 2° or<br>
more, the melting steel is excellently discharged, leading to<br>
30<br><br>
improvement in toughness or strength of weld.<br>
However, if the vee angle is excessively increased, weld<br>
is insufficiently heated and thereby temperature of the strip<br>
edge is hardly increased, conseguently a state where each edge<br>
is wholly covered with oxide films, called weld oxides, occurs<br>
rather than generation of melting steel, leading to significant<br>
reduction in toughness or strength of the weld. To cope with<br>
this, the inventors understood that if the vee angle was 8°<br>
or less, the weld oxides were able to be prevented.<br>
At that time, when each strip edge is previously shaped<br>
with tapering, the melting amount of one edge that is first<br>
melted is decreased by amount corresponding to such decreased<br>
volume, and melting proceeds along the tapering, so that<br>
melting steel is further decreased, therefore the penetrators<br>
can be sufficiently discharged from the electric resistance<br>
weld by both effects of the vee angle and the tapering, leading<br>
to significant improvement in toughness and strength.<br>
An embodiment of the invention as above is described<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a manufacturing line of an<br>
electric resistance welding pipe used in an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The manufacturing line of the electric resistance<br>
welding pipe has a basic configuration where a sheet (strip)<br>
10 is uncoiled from an uncoiler 1; then the strip is reformed<br>
to be flat by a leveler 2; then the strip 10 is gradually rounded<br>
31<br><br>
by a roll forming machine 4; then right and left, two lateral<br>
edges of a strip 20 that was rounded into a pipe shape are welded<br>
by electric resistance welding using an electric resistance<br>
welder including an induction heating section 5 and a squeeze<br>
roll (electric resistance welding section) 6 so that the strip<br>
is formed into a pipe 30; then a weld bead portion of the pipe<br>
30 is cut by a bead cutter 7; then the pipe 30 after cutting<br>
is adjusted in outer diameter by a sizer 8; and then the pipe<br>
30 is cut out into a predetermined length by a pipe cutter 9.<br>
In the embodiment, the roll forming machine 4 has a<br>
finpass forming stand 3 including a plurality of stands (for<br>
example, three stands) in a last stage, and as described before,<br>
a fin of each stand is formed into an appropriate shape, thereby<br>
a top side of each strip edge (inner surface side of the pipe)<br>
and/or a bottom side of each strip edge (outer surface side<br>
of the pipe) can be shaped with predetermined tapering.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 2A showing a cross section<br>
diagram and Fig. 2B showing a partial detail diagram thereof,<br>
an optional stand of the finpass forming stand 3 has a fin shape<br>
of predetermined two-stage tapering (second-stage tapering<br>
angle is a, and second-stage slope vertical-length is (3) . Such<br>
a fin shape is printed to lateral edges of the strip 10, thereby,<br>
right and left, two lateral edges at the bottom side of the<br>
strip 10 (outer surface side of the pipe) are shaped with the<br>
tapering having a tapering angle of a and a tapering height<br>
32<br><br>
of β.<br>
In the above way, the pipe-shaped strip 20, which is<br>
shaped with the tapering having a tapering angle of a and a<br>
tapering height of (3 at the outer surface side, and shaped with<br>
the tapering having a tapering angle of γ and a tapering height<br>
of 5 at the inner surface side, is set such that a vee angle<br>
φ is 2° to 8° for electric resistance welding as shown in Fig.<br>
11.<br>
Thus, the penetrators can be sufficiently discharged<br>
from the electric resistance weld, consequently an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having highly excellent toughness and<br>
strength can be obtained.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Hereinafter, example 1 is described.<br>
Here, a strip (steel strip) 1920 mm in width and 19.1<br>
mm in thickness was used to manufacture electric resistance<br>
welding pipes 600 mm in diameter. Test pieces were cut out<br>
from the weld of the manufactured electric resistance welding<br>
pipe, and subjected to Charpy test to evaluate performance of<br>
the pipes. Charpy test pieces were sampled by one for each<br>
of ten different points in a pipe length direction in a manner<br>
that a longitudinal direction of the test piece was parallel<br>
to a pipe circumferential direction, and a longitudinal center<br>
of a notch corresponded to a central position in thickness of<br>
33<br><br>
the weld. The test pieces were formed as JIS5 2 mm-V-notch<br>
impact test pieces, and subjected to an impact test at -46°C,<br>
and Charpy impact values and brittle fracture surface ratios<br>
were measured. A Charpy impact value of 125 J or more, and<br>
a brittle fracture surface ratio of 35% or less were specified<br>
as a performance allowable range respectively.<br>
(Example of the invention 1)<br>
As example of the invention 1, the electric resistance<br>
welding pipe was manufactured according to the first embodiment.<br>
That is, lateral edges of a strip at a side to be a pipe<br>
outer-surface side were shaped with tapering by a finpass<br>
forming end stand of which the fin has two angles (first angle<br>
of the fin is 85° with respect to a perpendicular to a roll<br>
axis). The slope angle a of the tapering was made to be 30°<br>
to a vertical edge of the strip.<br>
(Example of the invention 2)<br>
As example of the invention 2, the electric resistance<br>
welding pipe was manufactured according to the second<br>
embodiment. That is, in two-stand finpass forming, lateral<br>
edges of a strip at a side to be a pipe outer-surface side,<br>
and lateral edges of the strip at a side to be a pipe<br>
inner-surface side were shaped with the tapering by a first<br>
stand of which the fin has three angles (second angle of the<br>
fin is 40° with respect to a perpendicular to a roll axis),<br>
respectively. Either of the slope angle a at the side to be<br>
34<br><br>
the pipe outer-surface side and the slope angle γ at the side<br>
to be the pipe inner-surface side was made to be 25°.<br>
(Example of the invention 3)<br>
As example of the invention 3, the electric resistance<br>
welding pipe was manufactured according to the third embodiment.<br>
That is, in three-stand finpass forming, lateral edges of a<br>
strip at a side to be a pipe inner-surface side were shaped<br>
with tapering by a first stand of which the fin has two angles<br>
(first angle of the fin is 60° with respect to a perpendicular<br>
to a roll axis), and lateral edges of the strip at a side to<br>
be a pipe outer-surface side were shaped with tapering by a<br>
third stand of which the fin has two angles (first angle of<br>
the fin is 85° with respect to a perpendicular to a roll axis) .<br>
The slope angle a at the side to be the pipe outer-surface side<br>
was made to be 30°, and the slope angle y at the side to be the<br>
pipe inner-surface side was made to be 40°.<br>
(Prior art example 1)<br>
As prior art example 1, the electric resistance welding<br>
pipe was manufactured according to the method described in the<br>
patent document 1. That is, in a finpass forming first-stand<br>
of which the fin has one angle, it was attempted that the upset<br>
amount of finpass was adjusted so that lateral edges of a strip<br>
were contacted to the fin over an edge portion corresponding<br>
to approximate half the thickness, thereby lateral edges at<br>
a side to be a pipe inner-surface side were shaped with tapering,<br>
35<br><br>
and in a finpass forming second-stand of which the fin has one<br>
angle, it was aimed that lateral edges of the strip were<br>
intended to be contacted to the fin over the remained edge<br>
portion corresponding to approximate half the thickness so that<br>
lateral edges at a side to be a pipe outer-surface side were<br>
shaped with tapering. The slope angle of the tapering was made<br>
to be 20°.<br>
(Prior art example 2)<br>
As prior art example 2, the electric resistance welding<br>
pipe was manufactured according to the method described in the<br>
patent document 2. That is, it was attempted that an edger<br>
roll was arranged at an upstream side of finpass forming, and<br>
the edger roll was used to reduce lateral edges of a strip,<br>
thereby the lateral edges of the strip were wholly shaped with<br>
tapering, and in a finpass forming stand of which the fin has<br>
one angle, it was aimed that lateral edges of the strip were<br>
intended to be contacted to the fin over an edge portion<br>
corresponding to approximate half the thickness so that lateral<br>
edges at a side to be a pipe outer-surface side were shaped<br>
into vertical surfaces. The slope angle of the tapering was<br>
made to be 20°.<br>
(Prior art example 3)<br>
As prior art example 3, in the manufacturing line shown<br>
in Fig. 1, lateral edges of a strip were previously polished<br>
into a rectangular shape, and a finpass forming stand of which<br>
36<br><br>
the fin has one angle was used to manufacture the electric<br>
resistance welding pipe.<br>
Measurements were made on Charpy impact values and<br>
brittle fracture surface ratios of the weld of the electric<br>
resistance welding pipes manufactured according to the above,<br>
and results of the measurements are shown in Table 1. Moreover,<br>
lateral edges of the strips were cut and sampled immediately<br>
before electric resistance welding was performed, and shapes<br>
of the lateral edges were observed, and results of such<br>
observation are also described.<br>

From Table 1, in the examples of the invention 1 to 3,<br>
the weld has high impact strength and a small brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio, that is, toughness is excellent, and reliability<br>
of products is high. In contrast, in the prior art examples<br>
1 to 3, the weld has low impact strength and a large brittle<br>
fracture surface ratio, that is, toughness is reduced, and<br>
37<br><br>
reliability of products is low. Moreover, when the shapes of<br>
the lateral edges of the strips are compared to each other<br>
immediately before electric resistance welding is performed<br>
after finpass forming, while the desired tapering is kept on<br>
both the lateral edges at the side to be the pipe inner-surface<br>
side, and the lateral edges at the side to be the pipe<br>
outer-surface side in the examples of the invention 1 to 3,<br>
the lateral edges were smoothed during finpass forming, and<br>
the tapering was not kept in both of the prior examples 1 and<br>
2.<br>
Consequently, it was confirmed that an electric<br>
resistance welding pipe having excellent characterization of<br>
welded seam was able to be manufactured according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
Hereinafter, example 2 is described. In the example 2,<br>
a strip formed by a steel strip 1920 mm in width and 19.1 mm<br>
in thickness was passed through a pipe mill as shown in Fig.<br>
1, that is, a pipe mill including an uncoiler 1, a leveler 2,<br>
a roll forming machine 4 (including finpass forming having a<br>
plurality of stands (finpass roll stand) 3), an electric<br>
resistance welder (including a contact tip 50 and squeeze roll<br>
6), bead cutting means 7, a sizer 8, and a pipe cutter 9 so<br>
that a steel pipe 60 mm in outer diameter was manufactured.<br>
In this pipe manufacturing, manufacturing conditions were<br>
38<br><br>
varied as the following four conditions.<br>
(Example of the invention 21)<br>
A pipe outer-diameter side of each strip edge was shaped<br>
with approximately straight tapering (tapering angle a and<br>
tapering depth β were set as values as shown in Table 2) by<br>
a third stand of finpass forming 3 having three stands in all,<br>
and in an embodiment as shown in Fig. 7, argon gas was blown<br>
from gas supply nozzles 60 to edges of a strip 10 under heating<br>
of electric resistance welding (resistance heating from a<br>
contact tip 50) . In Fig. 7, 40 shows an advance direction of<br>
the strip 10 (formed into a pipe 30 after welding), and the<br>
squeeze roll is omitted to be shown.<br>
(Example of the invention 22)<br>
A pipe inner-diameter side of each strip edge was shaped<br>
with approximately straight tapering (tapering angle a and<br>
tapering depth β were set in values as shown in Table 2) by<br>
a first stand of finpass forming 3 having two stands in all,<br>
and a pipe outer-diameter side of the edge was shaped with the<br>
approximately straight tapering by a second stand of the<br>
finpass forming respectively, and in an embodiment as shown<br>
in Fig. 8, edges of a strip 10, which were under heating of<br>
electric resistance welding (resistance heating from a contact<br>
tip 50) while being passed in an advance direction 40, were<br>
enclosed by a gas atmosphere box 13, and the inside of the box<br>
was kept in an atmosphere of 1% carbon dioxide gas and nitrogen<br>
39<br><br>
gas as the remainder. In Fig. 8, 40 shows the advance direction<br>
of the strip 10 (formed into a pipe 30 after welding) , and the<br>
squeeze roll is omitted to be shown.<br>
(Comparative example 21)<br>
Each strip edge was shaped with approximately straight<br>
tapering (tapering angle a and tapering depth β were set as<br>
values as shown in Table 2) at both inner and outer diameter<br>
sides of a pipe by a first stand of finpass forming 3 having<br>
three stands in all, and each strip edge under heating of<br>
electric resistance welding was left to be exposed to the air.<br>
(Prior art example 21)<br>
A shape of each strip edge was kept to be an approximate<br>
rectangular shape (longitudinal edge shape of a rectangle),<br>
and each strip edge under heating of electric resistance<br>
welding was left to be exposed to the air.<br>
Test pieces were cut out from the weld of the steel pipes<br>
manufactured at the above four conditions, and subjected to<br>
Charpy test to evaluate performance of the pipes. As Charpy<br>
test pieces, JIS5 2 mm-V-notch impact test pieces were used,<br>
which were sampled by one for each of ten different points in<br>
a pipe length direction in a manner that a longitudinal<br>
direction of the test piece is taken in a pipe circumferential<br>
direction, and a longitudinal center of a notch is taken at<br>
a central position in thickness of the weld, and an impact test<br>
was performed at a test piece temperature of -46°C, and Charpy<br>
40<br><br>
impact values and brittle fracture surface ratios were measured.<br>
A Charpy impact value of 125 J or more, and a brittle fracture<br>
surface ratio of 35% or less were specified as a performance<br>
allowable range respectively. Results of the measurement are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
From Table 2, in the examples of the invention 21 and<br>
22, the weld has significantly high impact strength (Charpy<br>
impact values) and a small brittle fracture surface ratio, that<br>
is, toughness is excellent, and reliability of products is high.<br>
In contrast, in the comparative example 21 and the prior art<br>
examples 21, the weld has low impact strength (Charpy impact<br>
values) and a large brittle fracture surface ratio, that is,<br>
toughness is reduced, and reliability of products is low.<br>

direction in a manner that a longitudinal direction of the test<br>
piece was parallel to a pipe circumferential direction, and<br>
a longitudinal center of a notch corresponded to a central<br>
