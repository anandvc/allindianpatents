				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br><br>
2<br><br>
The invention relates to a glazing composition and method of preparation thereof and the method of painting using the composition with the regular emulsion in a novel manner to create an aesthetic look on the surface and in particular to the make the designs with different surface patterns to guide a painter in the painting process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is known that at the time of decorating a room, a variety of materials are available to guide and assist the decorator. One common example is to decorate the room with the use of wallpaper. In many cases some do not prefer to use the wallpaper because of the difficulty in pasting the wallpaper and more important is the difficulty in removing the wallpaper when further re-decorating is required.<br>
The alternative of wallpaper is the use of paint particularly because of easy re-decorating by simple re-painting. So, the use of paint for the purpose of decorating can be specially a challenge to the manufacturer of paints considering a scene or a pattern. For example, the popular way to decorate <br><br>
3<br>
the wall is to paint a colourful scene on the wall such as a landscape scene. However, when attempting to paint such a scene on a wall, the decorator must first design the appropriate scene and then paint the scene with appropriate sizes, proportions and colours.<br>
To perform such a task, a professional artist may be engaged for the project This may be expensive and considerable time and effort shall be expended to search &amp; appoint the appropriate artist One alternative to this approach has been suggested in US Patent No. 4,696,400, which relies on the use of a pattern projected on to a wall using a projector. The decorator then paints the wall as per the projected pattern. Such a process is undesirable because of the requirement of expensive projector and need the room to be darkened in order to see the pattern, thereby making it difficult to see when painting. Moreover, if the decorator stands in front of the projector, the image projected by the projector will be blocked. Further, if the projector is moved, the projected image will also move. The use of such a projector is un-desirable not only in view of above but also on the problem encountered to the size of the projected pattern which is dependent directly on the distance of the projector from the wall If the<br><br>
4<br>
room is not large enough, the appropriately sized pattern cannot be produced.<br>
US Patent No. 6,217,336 proposed an exemplary painting kits and methods for their use. In one exemplary embodiment, a painting kit is provided which comprises at least one sheet having a pattern which is adapted to be physically transferred to a painting surface, preferably by applying energy to the sheet The pattern defines regions which are to be painted with different colours.<br>
Preferably the sheet has a front side and the pattern is included on the front side. Further, the pattern is transferable to the painting surface by application of heat to the back side. For example, the pattern may be transferred simply by placing the sheet against a wall and moving a heated iron across the pattern until the pattern is transferred to the wall<br>
The pattern will be included on a plurality of sheet to make transfer of the pattern to the painting surface more manageable. A wide variety of pattern may be incorporated in to the kit<br><br>
5<br>
The said invention further provide and exemplary method for painting a surface. According to the method a pattern is physically transferred from a sheet to a surface to be painted. The surface is then painted with each region being painted with a pre-defined colour and paint<br>
A variety of other ways to heat transfer the pattern onto the painting surface are describe generally in US Patent No. 3,922,435; 4,027,345; 4,038,123; 4,066,810; 4,224,358; 4,294,641; 4,496,618; 5,100,718 &amp; 5,419,944; the complete disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The difficulties in painting onto to the surface with a definite pattern along with combination of colour for creating an aesthetic look can be solved by a simple process of this invention without putting much, effort as described in the prior art<br>
Hence, it would be desirable to provide a more convenient and effective way to allow a desired area to be decorated with the use of glazing liquid in regular emulsion paint It is also desirable to provide a way of paint onto a surface with minimal or no painting experience and with minimal preparation of time &amp; tools.<br><br>
6 OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the invention is to give a better life to the surface with the reduction of maintenance cycle-Further the object of invention is to give an attractive and colourful instead of normal and monotonous looking.<br>
The invention further aims at the glazing latex composition for better life<br>
J span of the paint film when using with a regular emulsion.<br><br>
7 STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
A heterogeneous glazing composition for painting on the surface comprises of a mixture in percentage (w/w) of Diluents (5-55), Wetting agent (0,1-10), Defoamer (0.1-8), Rheology modifier (0.1-1.50)), Polymeric binder (10-99), Coalescing agent (0.1-15), Preservative (0.2-4.50), Thickener (0.2-0.90).<br>
A process for the preparation of glazing composition includes the steps as follows:<br>
a) Taking diluents in a pot/tank and running HSD/CD/Remi at 10-30 rpm and adding raw materials such as wetting agent, defoamer, rheology modifier into it and stirring at the rpm 31-150.<br>
b) Adding coalescing agent preservative and thickener into the product obtained from step (a) and stirring at rpm 200, if required.<br>
a) <br>
8<br>
c) Adding further Acrylic Polymeric Emulsion to the mixture obtained from step (b) and stirring at rpm 600, if required.<br>
d) The above mixture is allowed to mix thoroughly for another 15 minutes to preserve in the prescribed container.<br>
A method of painting on the surface using the glazing composition includes the following steps:<br>
(1) Smoothening the surface as maximum as possible to reduce the undulation in case of new or old painted surface.<br>
(2) Making putty work in case of cement plaster with plaster of paris or asbestos wall but in case of plywood board/wooden wall, pucca putty of the following composition may be applied.<br>
(i) Soaking whiting powder and strain after removing all sandy particles through cloth sieving in water to make thick consistency paste and kept for overnight<br>
(ii) Adding enamel paint (White), varnish (Clear) and mixing thoroughly by a conventional process.<br><br>
9<br>
(iii) Appling the putty produced from step (ii) on the wall and allowing it to complete dry.<br>
(iv) Cutting the surface with sand paper and feeling the surface, if required by conventional process so that the surface is leveled with zero undulation. (3) Reducing the absorption capacity of the wall by the following process of treatment<br>
(i) Applying the composition made of enamel paint white with solvent thinnable cement primer and turpentine oil on the wall by a long hair double bristle brush and followed by a conventional sponge roller.<br>
(ii) Allowing it to dry fully and applying the second coat on the wall with the same composition.<br>
(iii) Rubbing the surface with sand paper and cleaning the same to remove all dusts and dirt<br><br>
10<br>
(4) Applying two coats of any emulsion or any satin finish giving an over coating interval 4-6 hours between the coats to get ready the surface for illusion work.<br>
(5) Painting the glazing latex solution with the regular emulsion on the base coat and some time on the top coat depending upon the requirement of the job.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This is a new concept in the area of paint and the process of painting. Different kinds of designs with surface ornamentation can be developed through this system. This process may develop a multi colour non-metallic and metallic design. Commonly a single colour (non-metallic) is used on the surface which in turn give a monotonous effect in the mind, Aesthetic looks are restricted in the old system of painting. Whereas the new innovative process gives a wide range of choice to the customer by giving aesthetic look on the surface.<br>
This design can be applied on a sand/cement plaster surface in addition to the wall made of plywood, board, wooden walls, asbestos wall etc.<br>
The process of painting requires the preparation of surface which comprises of the following steps:<br>
1) Smoothening the surface as maximum as possible to reduce the undulation in case of new or old painted surface.<br><br>
12<br>
2)	Making putty work in case of cement plaster with plaster of Paris or<br>
asbestos wall but in case of plywood board/wooden wall pucca<br>
putty of the following composition may be applied.<br>
(i) Soaking whiting powder (50 Kg.) and strain after removing all sandy particles through cloth sieving in water to make thick consistency paste and kept for overnight<br>
(ii) Adding 4-5 liters enamel paint (White), 2 liters varnish (Clear) and mixing thoroughly by a conventional process.<br>
(iii) Appling the putty produced from step (ii) on the surface and allowing it to complete dry (duration preferably 48-72 hours).<br>
(iv) Cutting the surface with sand paper (80/100, 100/120) and feeling the surface, if required by conventional process so that the surface is leveled with zero undulation..<br>
3)	Reducing the absorption capacity of the surface by the following<br>
process of treatment<br>
(i) Applying the composition made of enamel paint white (1 liter) with solvent thinnable cement primer (2 liters) and turpentine oil (15-20%) on the surface by a long hair double bristle brush and followed by a conventional sponge roller.<br><br>
13<br>
(ii) Allowing it to dry fully (duration 4-6 hours) and applying the second coat on the surface with the same composition.<br>
(iii) Rubbing the surface with sand paper (No.-120) and cleaning the same to remove all dusts and dirt<br>
4) Applying two coats of any emulsion or any satin finish giving an over coating interval 4-6 hours between the coats to get ready the surface for illusion work.<br>
5) Painting the glazing latex solution with the regular emulsion on the base coat and some time on the top coat depending upon the requirement of the job.<br>
During application of paints on the surface, some time should be provided to make even spread out The design will not appear on the surface after applying the roller if it absorbs and gets set on the surface quickly. So, before putting roller the surface should not be dried and set<br>
The glazing latex solution with the regular emulsion will increase the binding ratio as well as decrease the pigment ratio, resulting its opacity<br><br>
14<br>
going down, keeping the binding property intact; which gives the dual colour effect on the surface.<br>
In case of metallic emulsion finish on the surface, the base colour is formed on mixing the glazing latex solution (80-85%) with the metallic colorant (15-20%). Whereas in the case of top coat the glazing latex solution (20-30%) is mixed with the emulsion paint (1 liter). This will reduce the pigment concentration to a large extent without affecting the binding property. Moreover, this will increase the toughness of the paint film, which ultimately increase the paint film life as well as scrub resistance of the paint film.<br>
Different trials are taken place to achieve the appropriate glazing<br>
compositions.<br>
These compounds are mixed together having synergistic effect, and no<br>
chemical reaction have occurred during the process of mixing.<br><br>
