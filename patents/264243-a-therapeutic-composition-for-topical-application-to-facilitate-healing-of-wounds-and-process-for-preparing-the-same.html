				<td>The present invention relates to a therapeutic composition for topical<br>
application to facilitate healing of wounds and process for preparing the same.<br>
More particularly the subject invention pertains to a therapeutic composition<br>
capable of facilitating healing of wounds and simultaneously preventing bacterial,<br>
fungal and viral infections, comprising (i) source complexes selected from sucralfate,<br>
sucrose octasulphate and sucrose octaacetate, (ii) nitromidazole derivative like<br>
Tinidazole, Ornidazole, Secnidazole and Metronidazole, (iii) a compound<br>
providing free iodine such as povidone iodine, cadexomer iodine and potassium<br>
iodide and (iv) a stabilizer selected from Bronodiol, methyl paraben and/or propyl<br>
paraben and the composition is suitable for topical application.<br>
This invention also encompasses a process for preparing the<br>
above therapeutic composition, and constitutes an improvement in or modification<br>
of the invention described and claimed in the main Patent No.236701<br>
(296/KOL/2005) dated 11.04.2005.<br>
In the aforesaid main Patent there is described and claimed a<br>
therapeutic composition for topical application to facilitate healing of wounds<br>
and prevent bacterial, fungal and viral infections comprising (a) sucralfate,<br>
(b) metronidazole and (c) povidone iodine as active ingredients in suitable non-<br>
aqueous base like propylene glycol, 'PEG-400' and 'PEG-4000' (polyethylene<br>
glycols), characterized in that the said active ingredients are present in the<br>
following amounts in the final composition :<br><br>
The said main Patent also disclosed a process for preparing the<br>
aforesaid therapeutic composition for topical application, which comprises -<br>
(a) mixing povidone-iodine and metronidazole, followed by addition of<br>
sucralfate, and continuing mixing till formation of an emulsion under<br>
anaerobic condition, followed by homogenization ;<br>

the help of a pump and mixer unit;<br>
(d) cooling the mixture, storing in a stainless steel container, filling the<br>
semi-solid mass in suitable container by filling machine and sealing<br>
the same.<br>
It has surprisingly been observed that by substituting "metronidazole"<br>
by Tinidozole", and in certain instances by replacing "povidone-iodine", the subject<br>
invention demonstrates remarkable effects in the treatment of wounds of skin,<br>
such as abrasion of skin, wounds and different types of skin ulcers, apart from<br>
healing of wounds and preventing bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections<br>
generally associated with the wounds.<br>
Previously wound management/treatment was primarily done by<br>
topical application of cream/lotion/powder of anti-biotic/anti-septic preparation<br>
and in majority of instances such treatment did not provide complete healing of<br>
wounds. Present day preparations available in the market are usually on the<br>
basis of a single drug, which takes care only of bacterial infection. Further, if a<br>
portion of a skin tissue has been damaged by an injury or burn or due to other<br>
reasons ( such as chemical or radioactive burn ), it is of utmost importance to<br>
repair and heal the damaged portion expeditiously. The present invention aims<br>
at overcoming the shortcomings and disadvantages of conventional mode of<br>
treatment as narrated above, and is concerned with therapeutic compositions for<br>
treating a wide variety of skin ulcers, particularly suited for medical and veterinary<br>
applications.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic<br>
composition for topical application to facilitate healing of wounds and prevent<br>
bacterial, fungal and viral infections generally associated with wounds.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a composition for treating<br>
wide variety of skin ulcers, and particularly suited for both medical and veterinary<br>
applications.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic<br>
composition for treating a wide variety of skin ulcers and skin ailments and<br>
promoting healing of any open ulcer, and particularly suited for both medical<br>
and veterinary applications.<br>
A still another object of this invention is to provide a composition for<br>
promoting healing of surgical wounds, bites, burns, injury from chemicals,<br>
abrasions, lacerations and malodorous wounds.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic<br>
composition which promotes healing of diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers,<br>
radiotherapy ulcers and chronic ulcerative wounds.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic<br>
composition for treating wide variety of damaged skin conditions like radiation<br>
induced mucositis, proctitis, excoriation of skin tissue, aphthous ulcer, stomatitis,<br>
diaper rash, perianal excoriation, anal fissures, ano-rectal excoriation, solitary<br>
rectal ulcer syndrome and the like.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which<br>
relates to a therapeutic composition suited suited both for medical and veterinary<br>
application a therapeutic composition suited both for medical and veterinary<br>
applications and capable of facilitating healing of wounds and simultaneously<br>
preventing bacterial, fungal and viral infections comprising -<br>
(i) a sucrose complex like sucralfate /sucrose octa acetate /sucrose octa<br>
sulphate,<br>
(ii) a nitroimidazole derivative like tinidazole or ornidazole and<br>
(iii) a compound providing free iodine such as povidone iodine or cadexomer<br>
iodine, in a suitable non-aqueous base like propylene glycol, 'PEG-400'<br>
and 'PEG-4000' (polyethylene glycols), characterized in that the aforesaid<br>
ingredients are present in the following amounts in the final composition -<br>
(i) sucralfate/sucroseoctasulfate/sucroseoctaacetate - 7.0-7.5% w/w,<br>
(ii) nitroimidazole derivative like tinidazole/ornidazole - 0.99 - 1.25% w/w and<br>
(iii) free iodine from Povidone iodine or cadexomer iodine - 5 - 6 % w/w<br>
(providing 0.5 % available iodine)<br>
In the composition as disclosed above, propylene glycol acts as the<br>
humactant and there is also used a stabilizer selected from the group of "Bronopol",<br>
methyl paraben and propyl paraben for enhancing its shelf life. The amount of<br>
stabilizer added to the composition in the course of mixing of different phases<br>
containing constituent ingredients usually around 1% w/w of the final<br>
composition.<br>
The subject invention also pertaining to a process for preparing the<br>
aforementioned composition, which comprises -<br>
(i) preparation of solid phase by mixing of predetermined amounts of different<br>
ingredients;<br>
(ii) homogenization of solid phase in a suitable homogenizer;<br>
(iii) preparation of oil phases by heating propylene glycol, PEG-400 and<br>
PEG-4000 in a stainless steel steem jacketed kettle at a temperature<br>
of around 60°C and transferring the oil phase to a mixing kettle ;<br>
(iv) mixing of solid and oil phases at a temperature of around 70°C with the<br>
help of a pump and mixer with addition of stabilizer for enhancement of<br>
shelf life of the composition ;<br>
(v) cooling the mixture by gradually decreasing the temperature of the jacketed<br>
kettle at a rate consisting with the mixing of the emulsion ;<br>
(vi) storage of finished phase is done in a stainless steel container of suitable<br>
size;<br>

filling machine for being filled in suitable contaners/receptacles/collapsible<br>
tubes followed by proper sealing.<br>
In a further embodiment of the above process, the constituent<br>
ngredients are added/dispersed in oil phases and any undispersed matter is<br>
emoved by passing it through a 40-mesh screen and cooling of the semi-solid<br>
product is carried out in steam-jacketed kettle, the walls of which are so designed<br>
hat they prevent formation of congealed substances.<br>
In another embodiment of the above process, preparation of oil phase<br>
s carried out by mixing "PEG-400" and "PEG-4000" and heating the mixture to a<br>
emperature of 70°C, transferring the mass to a container at 70°C through 40-<br>
nesh screen, preparing slurries of ingredients separately in 'PEG-400', cooling<br>
he container to around 40°C while mixing them under stirring and washing the<br>
esulting thick mass to remove excess iodine, stirring the semi-solid mass under<br>
vacuum, followed by storage and transfer of semi-solid finished product for filling<br>
nto containers, sealing and packing, or for packing into bulk containers.<br>
As discusssed above, the subject composition has been found to be<br>
:xtremely effective in providing immediate relief from pain and long lasting healing<br>
)f ulcer/skin lesions and employs as active principles the following compounds<br>
n predetermined amounts:<br>

Certain test results based on experiments conducted in one of the<br>
leading Medical Colleges in Eastern India clearly establish the unexpectedness/<br>
synergism exhibited by the therapeutic composition of this invention. It will be<br>
clear from the anti-bacterial spectrum of the individual drugs that the composition<br>
of this invention has greater clinical benefits as well as expanded anti-bacterial<br>
activity. Moreover, the subject composition shows anti-inflammatory (by blocking<br>
the inflammatory mediators) as well as regenerative properties (by binding EGF),<br>
and is well-tolerated with no contra- indications or side effects even after prolonged<br>
topical application.<br>
To evaluate the role of the therapeutic composition of the present<br>
invention containing tinidazole, sucralfate and povidone iodine in the healing<br>
process of post surgical and contaminated superficial wounds, studies were<br>
conducted with both indoor and outdoor patients of Department of Surgery at<br>
N.R.S. Medical College &amp; Hospital in Kolkata. Patients receiving systemic (oral or<br>
i.v.) Tinidazole or Ornidazole were excluded from study.<br>
Example 16<br>
30 patients were evaluated with surgical site infections, diabetic ulcers,<br>
ulcers due to peripheral vascular disease and super ficial epithetial breachers by<br>
topical application of the composition of this invention. Another 20 patients with<br>
same condistions were also evaluated with placebo ointments.<br>
All wounds were clinically assessed for general appearance, signs of<br>
infection, degree of exudation, skin maceration, wound size, and local pain. A<br>
culture sensitivity swab was taken before the application of ointment, and 7 and<br>
14 days after the applicant of oinment.<br>
Treatment protocol: Wounds were cleansed with sterile normal saline before<br>
treatment. There were no forceful irrigation techniques and no other cleansing<br>
agents utilized. The same dressing technique was used throughout the study. It<br>
consisted of a non-adherent primary dressing and an absorbent secondary<br>
dressing. Treatment with the subject topical oinment was performed once daily.<br>
RESULTS :Results of the topical application were clinically assessed by general<br>
appearance of the wound, signs of infection, degree of exudation, skin maceration,<br>
wound size, and local pain. Culture swabs were taken from the wound. Out of<br>
the 30 patients, 17 patients showed signs of healthy granulation tissue within<br>
first 7 days, whereas in 9 patients the wounds became clean with diminished<br>
discharge within 14 days. 3 patients showed no improvement within 14 days<br>
and needed further surgical treatment. These 3 patients were suffering from<br>
peripheral vascular disease. 1 patient complain of itching over and around the<br>
wound.<br>
Out of the 20 patients treated with placebo ointment, 8 patients<br>
showed signs of healthy granulation tissue after 7 days, and 13 patients showed<br>
signs of improvements, whereas 7 patients showed no signs of healthy granulation<br>
tissue.<br><br>
EFFICACY OF FORMULATION IN CONTAMINATED WOUND<br>
MANAGEMENT<br>
CONCLUSIONS:<br>
1. TOPICAL APPLICATION OF FORMULATION CONTAINING TINIDAZOLE,<br>
POVIDONE IODINE AND SUCRALFATE SHOWED A DEFINITE ROLE IN<br>
IMPROVING SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS BY CONTROLLING LOCAL<br>
INFECTIONS &amp; AUGMENTING THE PROCESS OF HEALING.<br>
2. THIS TREATMENT IS COST EFFECTIVE IN LONG TERM MANAGEMENT<br>
OF WOUNDS.<br>
3. EFFECTIVE AS ANTIBIOTIC &amp; TISSUE REGENERATIVE OINTMENT<br>
WITHOUT ANY MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS.<br>
From the foregoing discussions and data given hereinbefore it will<br>
be seen that:<br>
(i) the subject therapeutic composition of this invention is well-tolarated and<br>
the constituents drugs do not interfere with the bio availability of each<br>
other;<br>
(ii) no toxic drug interactions are involved with the constituent components ;<br>
(iii) the composition stimulates wounds healing by activating keratinocytes<br>
and fibroblast functions;<br>
(iv) the synergistic combination of the main ingredients effectively shows anti-<br>
microbial action against all possible aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms<br>
present in the wounds ;<br>
(v) the regenerative and anti-inflammatory property of sucralfate accentuates<br>
anti-microbial and anti-viral perperties of the other two drugs by<br>
epithelialization and angiogenesis, and<br>
(vi) strengthening of exterior cell surface and connective tissue cell matrix makes<br>
it extremely difficult for bacteria and virus to penetrate and colonise the<br>
cells and the tissue.<br>
