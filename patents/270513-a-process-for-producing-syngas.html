				<td>TITLE: CATALYTIC PARTIAL OXIDATION REFORMING<br>
INVENTORS: AVINASH MALHOTRA AND DAVID P. MANN<br>
FIELD<br>
The present embodiments generally relate to systems and processes for producing<br>
synthesis gas and products made therefrom. More particularly, present embodiments<br>
relate to systems and processes for producing syngas and products made therefrom by<br>
partial oxidation techniques.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Partial oxidation ("POX") systems typically convert preheated hydrocarbon gas and<br>
oxidant at very high temperatures, e.g. from about 1,000°C (1,832°F) to about 1,300°C<br>
(2,372°F), to a syngas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water.<br>
The hot syngas must then be quenched or cooled, typically to about 200-300°C (392-<br>
572°F) prior to further processing.<br>
Typically, the syngas is used as a rather expensive heat transfer medium to generate steam.<br>
However, the steam production can be far in excess of process requirements and is<br>
therefore exported or simply wasted because there is no use for the steam. In other words,<br>
cooling the syngas means that much of the heat of reaction is lost or wasted.<br>
Maximizing or increasing the hydrogen and carbon monoxide production in an existing<br>
plant is desirable. However, the POX reactor is frequently a capacity-limiting operation<br>
because POX reactors cannot be easily expanded to increase production. There is a need,<br>
therefore, for more energy efficient systems and processes for producing syngas.<br>

separate invention, which for infringement purposes is recognized as including equivalents<br>
to the various elements or limitations specified in the claims. Depending on the context,<br>
all references below to the "invention" may in some cases refer to certain specific<br>
embodiments only. In other cases it will be recognized that references to the "invention"<br>
will refer to subject matter recited in one or more, but not necessarily all, of the claims.<br>
Each of the inventions will now be described in greater detail below, including specific<br>
embodiments, versions and examples, but the inventions are not limited to, these<br>
embodiments, versions or examples, which are included to enable a person having<br>
ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventions, when the information in this patent<br>
is combined with available information and technology.<br>
Systems and processes for producing syngas and products therefrom are provided. In one<br>
or more embodiments, a first hydrocarbon can be partially oxidized in the presence of an<br>
oxidant at conditions sufficient to partially combust a portion of the first hydrocarbon to<br>
provide carbon dioxide, non-combusted hydrocarbon, and heat. In one or more<br>
embodiments, at least a portion of the non-combusted hydrocarbon can be reformed in the<br>
presence of at least a portion of the heat generated in the partial oxidation step and one or<br>
more first catalysts to provide a first syngas. In one or more embodiments, the first syngas<br>
can contain, but is not limited to, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. In one<br>
or more embodiments, heat from the first syngas can be indirectly exchanged with a<br>
second hydrocarbon to reform at least a portion of the second hydrocarbon in the presence<br>
of steam and one or more second catalysts to provide a second syngas. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the second syngas can contain, but is not limited to, hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, and carbon dioxide.<br>
Figure 1 depicts an illustrative system for producing syngas using partial oxidation<br>
techniques, according to one or more embodiments. The system can include one or more<br>
catalytic partial oxidation ("CPOX") reactors 150 and one or more reforming exchangers<br>
200. One or more first catalysts can be disposed within the CPOX reactor 150 in one or<br>
more first catalyst zones or catalyst beds 155, 157 (two are shown). The one or more first<br>
catalyst beds 155, 157 can be, but are not limited to, a fixed bed, fluidized bed, monolith<br>
type bed, or any combination thereof. The one or more catalyst beds 155, 157 can be<br>
supported by any known method, such as screens, support rods/bars, or other suitable<br>
support structures.<br>
At least one of the reforming exchangers 200 can be a shell-and-tube type exchanger. The<br>
reforming exchanger 200 can include one or more tubes 205 at least partially disposed<br>
within the shell of the reforming exchanger 200. One or more second catalysts can be<br>
disposal within the one or more tubes 205 to provide one or more second catalyst zones<br>
210 within the one ore more tubes 205. The one or more second catalysts can be<br>
supported in the one or more tubes 205 by one or more screens 215 or other suitable<br>
support structures.<br>
The one or more tubes 205 can be arranged in any pattern or configuration within the shell<br>
of the reforming exchanger 200. Although not shown, the tubes 205 can include, but are<br>
not limited to, one or more fins, static mixers, rifling, heat conductive packing, turbulence<br>
causing projections, or any combination thereof, disposed on the external surface and/or<br>
the internal surface of the tubes 205. The one or more tubes can be of various types, for<br>
example, straight tubes, bayonet tubes (not shown), U-tubes (not shown), coiled tubes (not<br>
shown), or any combination thereof. In one or more embodiments, two or more tubes 205<br>
can be used which can have the same or different shape, length, and/or diameter or cross-<br>
sectional area The one or more tubes 205 can be disposed in a vertical, horizontal, or any<br>
other angle within the reforming exchanger 200.<br>
The tubes 205 can be supported within the shell of the reforming exchanger 200 by one<br>
or more tube sheets 201. The one or more tube sheets 201 can separate the shell-side of<br>
the reforming exchanger 200 from a first end of the one or more tubes 205 and can prevent<br>
fluid communication between the first end of the one or more tubes 205 and the shell-side<br>
of the reforming exchanger 200. A second end of the one or more tubes 205 can be in<br>
fluid communication with the shell-side of the reforming exchanger 200.<br>
Figure 2 depicts an illustrative cross-sectional top view of the reforming exchanger having<br>
a plurality of tubes, according to one or more embodiments. Figure 2 depicts one or more<br>
second catalyst zones 210 disposed within a plurality of tubes 205. A plurality of tubes is<br>
defined as two or more tubes 205. A heating zone 207 defined by the space between or<br>
around the one or more tubes 205 (see also Figun 1) allows heal to be indirectly<br>
transferred from a heat transfer medium introduced to the shell-side of the reforming<br>
exchanger 200 to the one or more catalyst zones 210.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, the one or more first catalysts in the CPOX reactor 150 and/or<br>
the one or more second catalysts in the reforming exchanger 200 can include, but are not<br>
limited to, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals, chromium, manganese, molybdenum,<br>
tungsten, tin, rhenium, bismuth, indium, phosphorus, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium,<br>
rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, oxides thereof, derivatives thereof,<br>
mixtures thereof, or combinations thereof. The one or more second catalysts in the<br>
reforming exchanger 200 can be the same or different as the one or more first catalysts in<br>
the one or more CPOX reactors 150. The one or more first catalysts disposed in the<br>
CPOX reactor 150, the one or more second catalysts disposed in the reforming exchanger<br>
200, or both can further include one or more catalyst support materials.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the catalyst support materials can be or can include a<br>
refractory oxide. For example, the refractory oxide can be alumina, particularly alpha<br>
alumina; zirconia; titania; hafnia; silica; or mixtures thereof. The catalyst support material<br>
can be or can include rare earth modified refractory metal oxides, where the rare earth may<br>
be any rare earth metal, for example, lanthanum or yttrium; and/or alkali earth metal<br>
modified refractory oxides. The catalyst support material can be categorized as materials<br>
having a substantially stable surface area at reaction conditions, for example, a surface<br>
area that is not substantially altered by reaction conditions or altered in a way that affects<br>
the reaction.<br>
The one or more first catalysts and/or second catalysts ("catalysts") can be in the form of<br>
granules, powder, beads, pills, pellets, flakes, cylinders, spheres, or other shapes. The<br>
catalysts can have a length or size ranging from 50 microns (0.002 in.) to about 1 cm (0.4<br>
in.). In one or more embodiments, the catalysts can have a length or size ranging from<br>
about 0.25 mm (0.01 in.) to about 6,5 mm (0.26 in.) or from about 0.5 mm (0.02 in.) to<br>
about 0.4 mm (0.16 in.).<br>
Additional reaction conditions, catalysts, and CPOX reactor 150 details can be found in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,486,313; 5,720,901; 7,226,548; and 7,261,751 all of which are fully<br>
incorporated by reference herein. Additional reforming process conditions, catalysts, and<br>
reforming exchanger 200 details can be found in U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,011,625; 5,122,299;<br>
5,362,454; 6,855,272; 7,138,001; and 7,220,505 all of which are fully incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
A first hydrocarbon via line 110 and an oxidant via line 140 can be introduced to the one<br>
or more CPOX reactors 150. The first hydrocarbon can be partially oxidized in the<br>
presence of the oxidant and the one or more first catalysts. The partial oxidation can occur<br>
at conditions sufficient to partially combust a portion of the first hydrocarbon to provide<br>
carbon dioxide, non-combusted hydrocarbon, and heat The non-combusted hydrocarbon<br>
can be at least partially reformed, in the presence of at least a portion of the heat generated<br>
in the partial oxidation step and the one or more first catalysts, to provide a first syngas.<br>
The first syngas can include, but is not limited to, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon<br>
dioxide. As the partially combusted first hydrocarbon flows through/across the one or<br>
more first catalyst zones 155, 157, at least a portion of the non-combusted hydrocarbon<br>
can react (i.e. be reformed) to provide the first syngas. In one or more embodiments, the<br>
first hydrocarbon via line 110 can be mixed with steam and/or carbon dioxide via line 115<br>
prior to introducing the first hydrocarbon to the one or more CPOX reactors 150.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, the first hydrocarbon and the oxidant<br>
can be mixed upstream of the CPOX reactor 150 to provide a reactant mixture, which can<br>
then be introduced to the CPOX reactor 150. Although not shown, in one or more<br>
embodiments, steam and/or carbon dioxide via line 115 can be introduced directly to the<br>
one or more CPOX reactors 150 or premixed with the oxidant<br>
The one or more oxidants via line 140 can be introduced to the one or more CPOX<br>
reactors 150 before the first of the one or more first catalyst zones 155, 157. In one or<br>
more embodiments, a portion of the one or more oxidants via line 140 can be introduced,<br>
before each of the one or more first catalyst zones 155, 157, thereby providing inter-<br>
catalyst bed oxidant injection. Inter-catalyst bed oxidant injection can provide<br>
independent regulation and control of the amount of oxidant introduced via line 140 to<br>
each catalyst bed 155, 157. Controlling the amount of oxidant introduced via line 140 to<br>
the one or more catalyst beds 155, 157 can improve reaction rate and temperature<br>
regulation within the one or more first catalyst zones 155, 157.<br>
The CPOX reactor 150 can be operated at a temperature of from about 700°C (1,292°F) to<br>
about 1,500°C (2,732°F) as measured by the temperature of the first syngas as the first<br>
syngas exits the CPOX reactor 150 via line 160. The CPOX reactor 150 can be operated<br>
at a temperature of from about 700°C (1,292°F), about 800°C (1,472°F), or about 900°C<br>
(I,652°F) to about 1,100°C (2,012°F), about 1,200°C (2,192°F), or about 1,300°C<br>
(2,372°F). The CPOX reactor 150 can be operated at a pressure of from about 100 kPa (0<br>
psig) to about 15,000 kPa (2,162 psig), or from about 400 kPa (44 psig) to about 8,500 kPa<br>
(1,219 psig).<br>
A second hydrocarbon via line 180 can be introduced to the one or more reforming<br>
exchangers 200. The second hydrocarbon can be mixed with steam via line 185. In one or<br>
more embodiments, the second hydrocarbon can be mixed with steam and carbon dioxide<br>
via line 185. The second hydrocarbon and steam mixture via line 180, with or without<br>
carbon dioxide, can be introduced to the one or more second catalyst zones 210. For<br>
example, the second hydrocarbon via line 180 can be introduced to the first end of the one<br>
or more second catalyst-containing tubes 205. The second hydrocarbon can be at least<br>
partially reformed by passing the second hydrocarbon through the one or more second<br>
catalyst zones 210 to provide a second syngas. The second syngas can include, but is not<br>
limited to, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The second syngas can exit<br>
the second end of the one or more tubes 205 through the screens 21S and can be mixed<br>
with the first syngas in mixing zone 222 to provide a mixed syngas or syngas product via<br>
line 230.<br>
The first syngas via line 160 can be introduced to the shell-side of the reforming<br>
exchanger 200. The first syngas and second syngas can be mixed in a mixing zone 222 to<br>
provide a mixed syngas. The heat necessary for reforming the second hydrocarbon in the<br>
second catalyst zone 210 can be provided by the mixed syngas as the mixed syngas flows<br>
along/across the one or more tubes 205 through the heating zone 207. Although not<br>
shown the first syngas can pass across or around the outside of the one or more tubes 205<br>
to indirectly transfer heat from the first syngas to the second catalyst zone 210 after which<br>
the first syngas and second syngas can be mixed in the mixing zone 222. The mixed<br>
syngas can be recovered as a syngas product ("syngas") via line 230.<br>
The first hydrocarbon via line 110 and the second hydrocarbon via line 180 can include,<br>
but are not limited to, one or more carbon containing materials. The carbon containing<br>
materials can include, but are not limited to, methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane,<br>
hexane, or any other hydrocarbon containing a total of one (1) to twenty (20) carbon atoms<br>
(C1 to C20), or any mixture thereof. The carbon containing materials can include, but are<br>
not limited to, C1 to C5 hydrocarbons or any mixture thereof. The carbon containing<br>
materials can include, but are not limited to, natural gas, methane, de-sulfurized natural<br>
gas, de-sulfurized methane, mixtures thereof, or any combination thereof. The first<br>
hydrocarbon and the second hydrocarbon can be the same or different carbon containing<br>
materials. The first hydrocarbon, the second hydrocarbon, or both can be substantially<br>
free of contaminants, such as sulfur, mercury, carbon monosulfide, and other<br>
contaminants.<br>
The first hydrocarbon via line 110 and/or the second hydrocarbon via line 180 can contain<br>
about 80% mol dry basis methane or more, or about 90% mol dry basis methane or more,<br>
or about 95% mol dry basis methane or more, or about 97% mol dry basis methane or<br>
more, or about 99% mol dry basis methane or more. The term "dry basis," as used herein,<br>
refers to a feed, product, syngas, or intermediate without water and/or nitrogen.<br>
The first hydrocarbon via line 110 can range from about 10% wt to 90% wt of the total<br>
combined first hydrocarbon and second hydrocarbon ("total feed"). The first hydrocarbon<br>
can range from about 20% wt to about 80% wt of the total feed or from about 30% wt to<br>
about 70% wt of the total feed, or from about 40% wt to about 60% wt of the total feed.<br>
The second hydrocarbon via line 180 can range from about 10% wt to about 90% wt of the<br>
total feed. The second hydrocarbon can range from about 20% wt to about 80% wt of the<br>
total feed, or from about 30% wt to about 70% wt of the total feed, or from about 40% wt<br>
to about 60% wt of the total feed.<br>
The types and amounts of the one or more oxidants introduced via line 140 to the one or<br>
more CPOX reactors 150 can influence the composition and physical properties of the first<br>
syngas via line 160 and the syngas via line 230. The one or more oxidants can include but<br>
are not limited to, air, oxygen, essentially oxygen, oxygen-enriched air, mixtures of<br>
oxygen and air, water, carbon dioxide, mixtures of oxygen and inert gas such as nitrogen<br>
and argon, nitrogen-enriched air, and any mixture thereof. The oxidant can contain about<br>
60% vol oxygen or more, or about 70% vol oxygen or more, or about 80% vol oxygen or<br>
more, or about 90% vol oxygen or more, or about 95% vol oxygen or more, or about 99%<br>
vol oxygen or more. As used herein, the term "essentially oxygen" refers to an oxidant<br>
containing more than 50% vol oxygen. As used herein, the term "oxygen-enriched air"<br>
refers to an oxidant stream containing more than 21% vol oxygen. Oxygen, essentially<br>
oxygen, or oxygen-enriched air can be obtained, for example, from cryogenic distillation,<br>
pressure swing adsorption, membrane separation, or any combination thereof. The one or<br>
more oxidants via line 140 can be nitrogen-free or essentially nitrogen-free. As used<br>
herein, the term "essentially nitrogen-free," refers to an oxidant stream containing about<br>
5% vol nitrogen or less, 4% vol nitrogen or less, 3% vol nitrogen or less, 2% vol nitrogen<br>
or less, or 1% vol nitrogen or less.<br>
The catalytic partial oxidation reaction that can occur in the CPOX reactor 150 can be<br>
promoted (i.e. controlled) by optimizing the concentrations of the one or more carbon<br>
containing materials and molecular oxygen (O2) introduced via line 140. The first<br>
hydrocarbon and oxidant can be adjusted to have, for example, a molar carbon:02 ratio<br>
(C:O2) in the range of from about 1:1 C:O2 to about 10:1 C:O2, or from about 1:1 OO2 to<br>
about 8:1 C:O2, or from about 1:1 C:O2 to about 6:1 C:O2. The molar C:O2 ratio can be in<br>
the range of from about 1.5:1 C:O2 to about 4:1 C:O2, or from about 1.6:1 C:O2 to about<br>
3.5:1 C:O2, or from about 1.6:1 C:O2 to about 2.5:1 C:O2.<br>
In one or more embodiments, steam and/or carbon dioxide can be present in the first<br>
hydrocarbon in line 110. Steam and/or carbon dioxide can be introduced directly to the<br>
CPOX reactor 150 and/or the first hydrocarbon in line 110. The weight ratio of steam to<br>
carbon of the first hydrocarbon via line 110 initially in contact with the first catalyst zone<br>
155 can be from about 0 to about 3 and the weight ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon of the<br>
first hydrocarbon initially in contact with the first catalyst zone 155 can be from about 0 to<br>

205, and/or the syngas product via line 230 that can contain about 30% mol dry basis<br>
hydrogen or more, or about 40% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 50% mol dry<br>
basis hydrogen or more, or about 60% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 70% mol<br>
dry basis hydrogen or more. The oxidant via line 140 can be selected to provide the first<br>
syngas via line 160, the second syngas exiting the one or more tubes 205, and/or the<br>
syngas product via line 230 that can contain about 5% mol dry basis carbon monoxide or<br>
more, or about 10% mol dry basis carbon monoxide or more, or about 15% mol dry basis<br>
carbon monoxide or more, or about 20% mol dry basis carbon monoxide or more, or about<br>
25% mol dry basis carbon monoxide or more, or about 30% mol dry basis carbon<br>
monoxide or more, or about 35% mol dry basis carbon monoxide or more. The oxidant<br>
via line 140 can be selected to provide the first syngas via line 160 and/or the syngas<br>
product via line 230 that can contain about 2% mol dry basis carbon dioxide or more, or<br>
5% mol dry basis carbon dioxide or more, or about 10% mol dry basis carbon dioxide or<br>
more, or about 20% mol dry basis carbon dioxide or more.<br>
The concentration of hydrogen in the first syngas via line 160, second syngas, and/or<br>
syngas product via line 230 can range from a low of about 30% mol dry basis, 40% mol<br>
dry basis, or 50% mol dry basis to a high of about 50% mol dry basis, 60% mol dry basis,<br>
or 70% mol dry basis. The hydrogen concentration in the first syngas via line 160, second<br>

dry basis, to a high of about 10% mol dry basis, 15% mol dry basis, or 25% mol dry basis.<br>
The compositions of the first syngas via line 160, second syngas exiting the one or more<br>
tubes 205, and/or the second syngas product via line 230 can have different concentrations<br>
of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. For example, the first syngas via line<br>
160 can have a hydrogen concentration of about 60% mol dry basis and the syngas product<br>
via line 230 can have a hydrogen concentration of about 70% mol dry basis. The<br>
concentrations of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the first syngas via<br>
line 160 and the syngas product via line 230 can vary over time. Several factors can affect<br>
the concentrations of the first syngas via line 160 and the syngas product via line 230,<br>
which can include, but are not limited to flow rates, hydrocarbon feed composition,<br>
temperatures, pressures, catalyst type, catalyst age, and oxidant.<br>

Figure 3 depicts another illustrative system for producing syngas using partial oxidation<br>
techniques, according to one or more embodiments. The one or more CPOX reactors 150,<br>
first hydrocarbon via line 110, oxidant via line 140, first syngas via line 160, second<br>
hydrocarbon via line 180, and syngas product via line 230 can be as discussed and<br>
described above with reference to Figure 1. The one or more reforming exchangers 200<br>
can be as discussed and described above with reference to Figure 1, however, the internal<br>
configuration of the shell-and-tube type exchanger can be different. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the one or more catalyst-containing tubes 205 can have two or more tube<br>
sheets 201 (two are shown) disposed about the tubes 205. The one or more catalyst-<br>
containing tubes 205 can have at least one tube sheet disposed at or near the first end of<br>
the tubes 205 and at least one tube sheet disposed at or near the second end of the tubes<br>
205 in such a manner that at least a portion of the second catalyst zone 210 can be<br>
positioned between the two tube sheets 201. In this embodiment, both ends of the<br>
catalyst-containing tubes 205 can be separated from (i.e. not in fluid communication with)<br>
the shell-side of the reforming exchanger 200.<br>
The second hydrocarbon via line 180 can be introduced to the first end of the one or more<br>
tubes 205. The second hydrocarbon can be reformed in the second catalyst zone 210<br>
within the one or more tubes 205. The tubes 205 can extend through the heating zone 207,<br>
which can be defined by the space or volume between the two or more tube sheets 201.<br>
The heat for the endothermic reforming reaction of the second hydrocarbon via line 180<br>
can be provided by the heat from the first syngas introduced via line 160 to the heating<br>
zone 207. Rather than mixing the first syngas and the second syngas to provide a syngas<br>
product, as shown in Figure 1, the first syngas can be recovered via line 223 and the<br>
second syngas can be recovered via line 227. In one or more embodiments, at least a<br>
portion of the first syngas via line 223 and at least a portion of the syngas via line 227 can<br>
be mixed to provide the syngas product via line 230. The first syngas via line 223, second<br>
syngas via line 227, or a mixture thereof (i.e. syngas product) via line 230 can contain, but<br>
are not limited to, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, three or more tube sheets 201 can be<br>
installed to provide two or more heating zones 207 within the reforming exchanger 200.<br>
For example, three tube sheets 201 (two are shown) can be installed with the first tube<br>
sheet 201 disposed at or near a first end of the one or more tubes 205, the second tube<br>
sheet 201 disposed at or near the second end of the one or more tubes 205, and the third<br>
tube sheet (not shown) can be disposed between the first tube sheet 201 and second tube<br>
sheet 201 to provide two independent heating zones. In one or more embodiments, the<br>
first syngas via line 160 can be split and at least a portion of the first syngas via line 160<br>
can be introduced to each independent heating zone. In one or more embodiments, the<br>
first syngas via line 160 can be introduced to one of the independent heating zones and a<br>
second heat transfer medium, such as steam, can be introduced to the other independent<br>
heating zone. This arrangement can improve temperature control within the multiple<br>
reaction zones as the amount of heat introduced to a particular heating zone from the first<br>
syngas via line 160 can be independently controlled by controlling the amount of the first<br>
syngas (or other heat transfer medium) introduced to the two or more heating zones.<br>
Figure 4 depicts another illustrative system for producing syngas using partial oxidation<br>
techniques, according to one or more embodiments. The one or more CPOX reactors 150,<br>
one or more reforming exchangers 200, first hydrocarbon via line 110, oxidant via line<br>
140, first syngas via line 160, second hydrocarbon via line 180, second syngas, and syngas<br>
product via line 230 can be as discussed and described above with reference to Figures 1-<br>
3. In one or more embodiments, the system can further include one or more heat<br>
exchangers (two are shown 130, 170). The heat exchangers can be used to preheat the<br>
first hydrocarbon via line 110, second hydrocarbon via line 180 and/or to cool the first<br>
syngas via line 160.<br>
The first hydrocarbon in line 110 can be preheated in one or more heat exchangers 130 by<br>
a beat transfer medium, such as steam, supplied via line 120. The first hydrocarbon in line<br>
110 can be preheated to a temperature of from about 100°C (212°F) to about 900°C<br>
(1,652°F), or from about 100°C (212°F) to about 700°C (1,292°F), or from about 300°C<br>
(572°F) to about 500°C (932°F). For example, the first hydrocarbon in line 110 can be<br>
preheated to a temperature of about 400°C (752°F), about 500°C (932°F), or about 600°C<br>
(1,112°F).<br>
The second hydrocarbon in line 180 can be preheated in one or more heat exchangers 170<br>
using the first syngas in line 160 as a heat transfer medium. In one or more embodiments,<br>
the second hydrocarbon in line 180 can be preheated in heat exchanger 170 by transferring<br>
heat to the second hydrocarbon in line 180 from an externally supplied heat transfer<br>
medium, such as steam. The second hydrocarbon via line 180 can be preheated to a<br>
temperature of from about 100°C (212°F) to about 900°C (1,652°F), or from about 300°C<br>
(212°F) to about 700°C (1,292°F), or from about 450°C (842°F) to about 650°C<br>
(1,202°F). For example, the second hydrocarbon in line 180 can be preheated to a<br>
temperature of about 400°C (752°F), about 500°C (932°F), or about 600°C (1,112°F).<br>
In one or more embodiments, the first syngas in line 160 can be cooled between the CPOX<br>
reactor 150 and the reforming exchanger 200. The first syngas in line 160 can be cooled<br>
by indirect cooling, direct cooling, or both. The first syngas in line 160 can be cooled, for<br>
example, by direct cooling with water, carbon dioxide, or any other suitable cooling<br>
medium introduced via line 165. The first syngas in line 160 can be cooled by non-contact<br>
cooling, for example, by indirectly transferring heat with a heat transfer medium in one or<br>
more heat exchangers, for example heat exchanger 170. Any suitable heat transfer<br>
mediums can be used in the heat exchanger 170, for example, the second hydrocarbon via<br>
line 180, water (not shown), another process feed from within the plant (not shown),<br>
mixtures thereof, or combinations thereof. The first syngas via line 160 can be cooled to<br>
temperature of from about 700°C (1,292°F) to about 1,100°C (2,012°F) or from about<br>
750°C (1,382°F) to about 1,000°C (1,832°F).<br>
The temperature of the first syngas introduced via line 160 to the reforming exchanger 200<br>
can be about 10% to about 300% greater than the temperature of the second hydrocarbon<br>
introduced via line 180 to the reforming exchanger 200. The temperature of the first<br>
syngas introduced via line 160 to the reforming exchanger 200 can be about 30% greater,<br>
about 40% greater, about 50% greater, about 60% greater, or about 70% greater or more<br>
than the temperature of the second hydrocarbon introduced via line 180 to the reforming<br>
exchanger 200.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments the oxidant introduced via line 140 to<br>
the CPOX reactor 150 can be preheated in one or more heat exchangers or mixed with the<br>
first hydrocarbon and heated in heat exchanger 130. The oxidant can be preheated to a<br>
temperature of from about 100°C (212°F) to about 900°C (1,652°F), or from about 100°C<br>
(212°F) to about 700°C (1,292°F), or from about 300°C (572°F) to about 500°C (932°F).<br>
Figure 5 depicts yet another illustrative system for producing syngas using partial<br>
oxidation techniques, according to one or more embodiments. The one or more CPOX<br>
reactors 150, first hydrocarbon via line 110, oxidant via line 140, second hydrocarbon via<br>
line 180, first syngas via line 160, second syngas, and syngas product via line 230 can be<br>
as discussed and described above with reference to Figures 1-4. The one or more<br>
reforming exchangers 200 can be as discussed and described above with reference to<br>
Figure 1, however, the internal configuration of the shell-and-tube type exchanger can be<br>
different. In one or more embodiments, the one or more second catalysts can be disposed<br>
within at least a portion of the shell-side of the reforming exchanger 200 to provide one or<br>
more second catalyst zones 220. The one or more second catalysts in the second catalyst<br>
zone 220 can be supported by a catalyst screen 225, or any other suitable support structure<br>
to provide a mixing zone 222 adjacent the second end of the one or more tubes 205. In<br>
one or more embodiments, the second catalyst can be placed within the shell-side of the<br>
reforming exchanger without a catalyst screen 225, wherein the mixing zone 222 can<br>
contain a portion of the second catalyst .<br>
Figure 6 depicts an illustrative cross-sectional top view of the reforming exchanger having<br>
a plurality of tubes, according to one or more embodiments described. Figure 6 depicts<br>
the second catalyst zone 220 disposed within at least a portion of the shell-side of the<br>
reforming exchanger 200. The second catalyst zone 220 can be disposed about the one or<br>
more catalyst free tubes 205. Heat can be indirectly transferred from a heat transfer<br>
medium which can flow through the tubes 205 to the second catalyst zone 220.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, the first syngas via line 160 can be introduced to the tube-side<br>
of the reforming exchanger 200. The first syngas via line 160 can flow through the one or<br>
more tubes 205. The second hydrocarbon can be introduced via line 180 to the shell-side<br>
of the reforming exchanger 200, which can flow through and/or across the second catalyst<br>
zone 220, wherein the second hydrocarbon can be reformed to provide the second syngas<br>
which can be introduced to the mixing zone 222 through catalyst screens 225. The heat<br>
necessary for reforming the second hydrocarbon can be indirectly transferred from the first<br>
syngas flowing through the one or more tubes 205 to the second catalyst zone 220.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, the first syngas and second syngas can<br>
be mixed outside the reforming exchanger 200 as discussed and described with reference<br>
to Figure 3. In one or more embodiments, the first syngas and the second syngas can be<br>
independently recovered (i.e. no mixing) from the reforming exchanger 200. For example,<br>
the catalyst screen 225 can be replaced by a second tube sheet 201, which can provide<br>
separate and independent flow paths for the first syngas and the second syngas. The<br>
second syngas can be recovered from an exit line in fluid communication with the shell-<br>
side of the reforming exchanger 200 and the first syngas can be recovered from an exit<br>
line in fluid communication with the tube side of the reforming exchanger.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, the first syngas introduced via line 160<br>
can be apportioned differently to different areas throughout the catalyst zone. For<br>
example, two or more sets of independently supplied tubes disposed within and/or through<br>
the second catalyst zone 220 can be introduced with varying amounts of the first syngas<br>
via line 160. For example, 70% of the first syngas via line 160 can be introduced to a first<br>
set of tubes and 30% can be introduced to a second set of tubes, which can provide more<br>
heat in a first portion of the catalyst zone 220 wherein more unreacted second hydrocarbon<br>
via line 180 can be present. The two or more sets of independently supplied tubes<br>
disposed within and/or through the second catalyst zone 220 can be straight, U-form,<br>
spiral wound, and/or bayonet type tubes.<br>
Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, the first syngas via line 160 can be<br>
introduced at either end of the one or more tubes 205 and/or anywhere along the length of<br>
the one or more tubes 205. For example, the first syngas via line 160 can be introduced<br>
directly to the mixing zone 222, and the mixed syngas can flow through the one or more<br>
tubes 205.<br>
Figure 7 depicts an illustrative system for producing syngas and one or more hydrogen<br>
containing products therefrom, according to one or more embodiments. The syngas<br>
product via line 230 can be produced using the one or more embodiments discussed and<br>
described above with reference to Figures 1-6. The system can further include one or<br>
more high temperature shift converters ("HTSC") 350, one or more medium temperature<br>
shift converters ("MTSC) 400, one or more low temperature shift converters ("LTSC")<br>
450, and/or one or more separation systems 500. At least a portion of the syngas via line<br>
230 can be introduced to the one or more HTSCs 350, MTSCs 400, LTSC 450, and/or<br>
separation systems 500. Although not shown, in one or more embodiments, the syngas<br>
can be as discussed and described above with reference to Figure 3. For example, the<br>
syngas product via line 230 can be a syngas product via line 223, a syngas product via line<br>
227, a syngas product via line 230, or combinations thereof, (i.e. the first syngas and/or the<br>
second syngas can be independently processed without mixing or mixing only a portion of<br>
each to provide the syngas via line 230).<br>
Referring again to Figure 7, the HTSC 350, MTSC 400, and LTSC 450 can contain one or<br>
more catalysts. The HTSC 350, MTSC 400, and LTSC 450 can convert carbon monoxide<br>
in the syngas in line 230 to carbon dioxide by reacting the carbon monoxide in the<br>
presence of the catalyst, disposed in the HTSC 350, MTSC 400, and/or LTSC 450, at a<br>
temperature sufficient to oxidize the carbon monoxide. The catalyst disposed in the HTSC<br>
350 can include, but is not limited to, iron oxide, zinc ferrite, magnetite, chromium oxides,<br>
derivatives thereof, or any combination thereof. The HTSC 350 can be operated at a<br>
temperature of from about 325°C (617°F) to about 550°C (1,022°F). The catalyst<br>
disposed in the MTSC 400 can include, but is not limited to, iron oxide, chromium oxide,<br>
derivatives thereof, or any combination thereof. The MTSC 400 can be operated at a<br>
temperature of from about 250°C (482°F) to about 300°C (572°F). The catalyst disposed<br>
in the LTSC 450 can include, but is not limited to, copper, zinc, copper promoted chromia,<br>
derivatives thereof, or any combination thereof. The LTSC 450 can be operated at a<br>
temperature from about 180°C (356°F) to about 220°C (428°F).<br>
The one or more separation systems 500 can selectively separate the syngas introduced via<br>
line 230 to provide a hydrogen product via line 510 and a waste product via line 515. In<br>
one or more embodiments, the one or more separation systems 500 can include, but are not<br>
limited to, membrane separation systems, pressure swing adsorption systems, and/or<br>
cryogenic separation systems. The membrane separation system can include, but is not<br>
limited to, one or more carbon molecular sieves, polymeric membranes, co-polymer<br>
membranes, palladium-alloy membranes, ceramic membranes, perovskite-based<br>
membranes, zeolite based membranes, molecular sieves, or any combination thereof. The<br>
pressure swing adsorption system can include, but is not limited to, one or more adsorbent<br>
materials that are selected to allow the passage of hydrogen through the pressure swing<br>
adsorption system, while impeding the passage of other gases, for example, carbon<br>
monoxide and carbon dioxide. The adsorbent materials can include, but are not limited to,<br>
activated carbon, zeolites, silica gel, selective surface flow membranes, anhydrous calcium<br>
sulfate, lithium chloride, derivatives thereof, mixtures thereof, or combinations thereof.<br>
The cryogenic separation system can separate a mixed gas stream into two or more parts.<br>
The cryogenic separation system can use one or more operation systems, including, but<br>
not limited to, compression, dehydration, separation by cryogenic distillation, and re-<br>
vaporization.<br>
In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the syngas can be introduced via line<br>
230 to the one or more HTSCs 350 to provide an intermediate via line 360. In one or<br>
more embodiments, at least a portion of the intermediate via line 360 can be introduced to<br>
the one or more MTSCs 400, the one or more LTSCs 450, separation systems 500, or any<br>
combination thereof.<br>
In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the syngas can be introduced via line<br>
230 to the one or more MTSCs 400 to provide an intermediate via line 410. In one or<br>
more embodiments, at least a portion of the intermediate via line 410 can be introduced to<br>
the one or more HTSCs 350, the one or more LTSCs 450, separation systems 500, or any<br>
combination thereof.<br>
In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the syngas via line 230 can be<br>
introduced to the one or more LTSCs 450 to provide an intermediate via line 460. In one<br>
or more embodiments, at least a portion of the intermediate via line 460 can be introduced<br>
to the one or more HTSCs 350, the one or more MTSCs 400, separation systems 500, or<br>
any combination thereof.<br>
The syngas provided via line 360 from the HTSC 350, via line 410 from the MTSC,<br>
and/or via line 460 from the LTSC 450 can contain less carbon monoxide than the syngas<br>
introduced via line 230 and/or the other intermediates via lines 360, 410, and/or 460. The<br>
intermediates provided via line 360 from the HTSC 350, via line 410 from the MTSC 400,<br>
and/or via line 460 from the LTSC 450 can contain 5% mol or less dry basis carbon<br>
monoxide, or 3% mol or less dry basis carbon monoxide, or 2% mol dry basis or less<br>
carbon monoxide, or 1% mol or less dry basis carbon monoxide, or 0.5% mol dry basis or<br>
less dry basis carbon monoxide.<br>
The syngas via line 230, intermediate via line 360, intermediate via line 410, and/or<br>
intermediate via line 460, can be apportioned equally or unequally to any one or more of<br>
the following: HTSCs 350, MTSCs 400, LTSCs 450, and/or separation systems 500. For<br>
example, about 75% of the syngas via line 230 can be introduced to the HTSCs 350 and<br>
25% can be introduced to the MTSCs 400. The intermediates via lines 360 and 410 can<br>
then be introduced to the separation system 500 to provide the hydrogen product via line<br>
510 and the waste product via line 515.<br>
In one or more embodiments, syngas can be introduced via line 230 to the one or more<br>
HTSCs 350 to provide the intermediate via line 360. The intermediate via line 360 can be<br>
introduced to the one or more MTSCs 400 to provide an intermediate via line 410. The<br>
intermediate via line 410 can be introduced to the one or more LTSCs 450 to provide an<br>
intermediate via line 460. The intermediate via line 460 can be introduced to the one or<br>
more separation systems 500 to provide the hydrogen product via line 510 and the waste<br>
product via line 515.<br>
The hydrogen product via line 510 can contain about 90% mol dry basis hydrogen or<br>
more, or about 95% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 97% mol dry basis<br>
hydrogen or more, or about 99% mol dry basis hydrogen or more. The hydrogen product<br>
via line 510 can contain about 99.5% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 99.9% mol<br>
dry basis hydrogen or more. The waste product via line 515 can include but is not limited<br>
to, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and inerts.<br>
Figure 8 depicts an illustrative system for producing syngas, hydrogen products, and<br>
ammonia, according to one or more embodiments. The syngas via line 230 can be<br>
produced using the system and processes discussed and described above with reference to<br>
Figures 1-6. The system can further include one or more HTSCs 350, one or more<br>
MTSCs 400, one or more LTSCs 450, which can be as discussed above in reference to<br>
Figure 7. The system can include one or more carbon dioxide removal systems 550. The<br>
system can include one or more driers 650, cryogenic separation units 700, and/or<br>
ammonia synthesis units 750. At least a portion of the syngas via line 230 can be<br>
introduced to the one or more HTSCs 350, the one or more MTSCs 400, the one or more<br>
LTSCs 450, and/or the one or more carbon dioxide removal systems 550. Although not<br>
shown, in one or more embodiments, the syngas can be as discussed and described above<br>
with reference to Figure 3 (i.e. the first syngas and/or the second syngas can be<br>
independently processed downstream without mixing or mixing only a portion of each to<br>
provide the syngas via line 230).<br>
As discussed above in reference to Figure 7, prior to introducing at least a portion of the<br>
syngas via line 230 to the one or more separation systems 500 in Figure 7, at least a<br>
portion of the syngas via line 230 can be apportioned equally or unequally and in any<br>
order or combination to any one or more of the one or more HTSCs 350, the one or more<br>
MTSCs 400, and/or the one or more LTSCs 450 to provide the intermediates via lines 360,<br>
410, and/or 460, respectively, which can be introduced to the one or more carbon dioxide<br>
removal systems 550.<br>
The one or more carbon dioxide removal systems 550 can include one or more physical<br>
separation systems including, but not limited to, membrane type systems and solvent<br>
based systems. For example, the one or more carbon dioxide removal systems 550 can<br>
include, but is not limited to, absorbtion/desorption type, solvent-based systems. The<br>
carbon dioxide removal system 550 can contact the syngas introduced via line 230 and/or<br>
intermediates introduced via lines 410, 460 and/or 510 with one or more absorbents to<br>
remove at least a portion of the carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide selective adsorbents can<br>
include, but are not limited to, monoethanolamine ("MEA"), diethanolamine ("DEA"),<br>
triethanolamie ("TEA"), potassium carbonate, methyldiethanolamine ("MDEA"),<br>
diglycolamine ("DGA"), diisopropanolamine ("DIPA"), derivatives thereof, mixtures<br>
thereof, or any combination thereof. Other suitable adsorbents and techniques can include,<br>
but are not limited to, propylene carbonate physical adsorbent solvent as well as other<br>
alkyl carbonates, dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol of two to twelve glycol units<br>
(Selexol™ process), n-methyl-pyrrolidone, sulfolane, and use of the Sulfinol® Gas<br>
Treatment Process.<br>
The one or more carbon dioxide removal systems 550 can provide a hydrogen product via<br>
line 560 and a carbon dioxide byproduct via line 565. The hydrogen product via line 560<br>
can contain about 90% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 95% mol dry basis<br>
hydrogen or more, or about 97% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 99% mol dry<br>
basis hydrogen or more. The hydrogen product or carbon dioxide lean syngas via line 560<br>
can contain about 10% mol dry basis carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide or less, or 5%<br>
mol dry basis carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide or less, or 3% mol dry basis carbon<br>
monoxide and carbon dioxide or less, or 1% mol dry basis carbon monoxide and carbon<br>
dioxide or less.<br>
The recovered carbon dioxide via line 565 can be used in a fuel recovery process to<br>
enhance the recovery of oil and gas. In an illustrative oil recovery process, carbon dioxide<br>
can be injected and flushed into an area beneath an existing well where "stranded" oil<br>
exists. The water and carbon dioxide removed with the crude oil can then be separated<br>
and recycled.<br>
For ammonia production and other nitrogen containing products that require nitrogen, an<br>
oxidant containing nitrogen can be introduced via line 140 to the CPOX reactor 150 (see<br>
Figure 1). The oxidant introduced via line 140 to the first hydrocarbon in line 110 can be<br>
or include air, nitrogen-enriched air, other nitrogen containing gases, or excess air. The<br>
term "excess air" as used here means that the resulting molar ratio of hydrogen to nitrogen<br>
(following shift conversion) in the syngas can be less than about 3 (the typical<br>
stoichiometric ratio for ammonia syngas make-up). As used herein, the term "nitrogen-<br>
enriched air" refers to an oxidant stream containing 79% vol or more nitrogen. Using air<br>
instead of oxygen or oxygen-enriched air can be economically beneficial where the<br>
nitrogen content and/or hydrogen purity of the syngas is not critical, for example, in fuel<br>
cells, in the hydrotreatment of crude oil or heavy fractions thereof, or in applications<br>
where the nitrogen is inert and the presence thereof does not significantly affect the<br>
economics of the process. Air can be used as a substitute for pure oxygen when economic<br>
or space considerations restrict the use of a conventional air separation unit ("ASU"), such<br>
as when a CPOX reactor 150 and reforming exchanger 200 are used for producing<br>
hydrogen for use on a floating production storage and offtake ("FPSO") facility. If<br>
desired, the air can be supplied by a compressor that can be driven by a gas turbine, and<br>
heat recovered from the gas turbine exhaust can be used, for example, to preheat process<br>
feed streams, generate process steam, or the like.<br>
Using air or excess air as the oxidant can provide a first syngas via line 160, and syngas<br>
via line 230, which can contain, but is not limited to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, and nitrogen. The syngas via line 230 can have a nitrogen content ranging from<br>
20% mol dry basis to about 80% mol dry basis.<br>
At least a portion of the hydrogen product (with or without nitrogen) via line 560 can be<br>
introduced to a methanator 600. The methanator 600 can convert at least a portion of any<br>
residual carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the hydrogen product in line 560 to<br>
methane and water to provide a hydrogen product via line 610 which can be essentially<br>
free (i.e. less than 500 ppmw) of total carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The<br>
methanator 600 can be a catalytic process operating at a temperature sufficient for<br>
converting or reacting at least a portion of the carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide to<br>
methane and water. Suitable methanator catalysts can include, but are not limited to,<br>
nickel, a rare earth promoted nickel, derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof. The<br>
methanator 600 can operate at a temperature of from about 200°C (392°F) to about 400°C<br>
(752°F). The hydrogen product in line 610 can contain about 50 ppm carbon monoxide<br>
and carbon dioxide or less, or 30 ppm carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide or less, or 10<br>
ppm carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide or less. When an oxidant containing nitrogen is<br>
used the hydrogen product via line 610 can contain about 20% mol (excluding water) to<br>
about 80% mol (excluding water) nitrogen.<br>
At least a portion of the hydrogen product via line 610 can be introduced to a drier 650, a<br>
cryogenic separation unit 700, an ammonia synthesis unit 750, or a combination thereof.<br>
The drier 650 can remove water from the hydrogen product to provide a dried hydrogen<br>
product via line 660 and water via line 665. The drier 650 can include, but is not limited<br>
to, one or more molecular sieves, absorbents, adsorbents, flash tank separators,<br>
incinerators, or any combination thereof. Suitable absorbents can include, but are not<br>
limited to, glycol, alkali-earth halide salts, derivatives thereof, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable adsorbents can include but are not limited to, activated alumina, silica gel,<br>
molecular sieves, activated carbon, derivatives thereof, or mixtures thereof. The hydrogen<br>
product via line 660 can contain about 90% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 95%<br>
mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 97% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about<br>
99% mol dry basis hydrogen or more.<br>
In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the hydrogen product via line 610, dried<br>
hydrogen product via line 660, or both can be introduced to a cryogenic separation unit<br>
700 and/or an ammonia synthesis unit 750. The cryogenic separation unit 700 can remove<br>
contaminants such as methane and inerts to provide a purified hydrogen product via line<br>
710. In one or more embodiments, if present in the hydrogen product in lines 610 and/or<br>
dried hydrogen product in line 660, excess nitrogen can be removed to provide a hydrogen<br>
to nitrogen (hydrogen:N2) ratio of approximately 3:1 (or any other desirable ratio) in the<br>
purified hydrogen product via line 710. The contaminants, i.e., waste, removed via line<br>
715 can contain, but are not limited to, methane, nitrogen, water, and inerts can be<br>
recovered via line 715.<br>
The purified hydrogen product in line 710 can contain about 97% mol dry basis hydrogen<br>
or more, or about 99% mol dry basis hydrogen or more, or about 99.5% mol dry basis<br>
hydrogen or more, or about 99.9% dry basis hydrogen or more. The purified hydrogen<br>
product in line 710 (for use, for example, in ammonia synthesis), can contain nitrogen and<br>
can have a hydrogen to nitrogen ratio of about 3:1 (or any other desirable ratio).<br>
In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the hydrogen product via line 560,<br>
hydrogen product via line 610, dried hydrogen product via line 660, purified hydrogen<br>
product via line 710, or any combination thereof, can be supplied as an ammonia synthesis<br>
feed to the ammonia synthesis unit 750 to provide an ammonia product via line 760.<br>
However, optimal feed compositions and therefore, optimal ammonia yield can be<br>
hindered by introducing an ammonia synthesis feed containing excess nitrogen.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the ammonia synthesis unit 750 can include any systems,<br>
devices, and/or combinations thereof suitable for converting or reacting hydrogen and<br>
nitrogen to provide ammonia. While not shown, in one or more embodiments, the<br>

and make-up gas to the reactor system.<br>
The catalytic synthesis reactor can be single or multi-pass converters using a magnetite<br>
and/or platinum group metal catalyst, for example, ruthenium. In one or more<br>
embodiments, the one or more catalytic synthesis reactors can include any reactor intended<br>
to operate at elevated pressures and/or temperatures to convert or react at least a portion of<br>
a feed gas containing nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia. Additional reaction, catalyst,<br>
and catalytic synthesis reactor details, which can be used for producing ammonia can be<br>
found in U.S. Patent Nos.: 7,081,230; 6,171,570; and 6,132,687, each of which are fully<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
