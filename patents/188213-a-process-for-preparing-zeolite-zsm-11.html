THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCIRBES<br>
AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN<br>
WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED: -<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing zeolite ZSM-U using a templating agent comprising at least one 3,5-dimethylpiperidiniuni (3,5-DMP) compound, and to zeolite ZSM-11 in pure phase form.<br>
Zeolite ZSM-11 and methods for making it are known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979, issued January 9, 1973 to Chu, discloses the preparation of ZSM-11 using quaternary cations of a Group S-A element, such as ammonium and phosphonium compounds, as the organic templating agent. It does not, however, disclose the 3,5-DMP compounds of this invention as templating agents. U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,108,881, issued August 22,1978 to Rolhnan et al., teaches the synthesis of ZSM-11 using C7 and C12 alkylenediamines as the organic templating agent.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,894,212, issued January 16, 1990 to McWilliams et al., discloses a method for synthesizing ZSM-U using octylamine as the organic templating agent.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,941,963, issued July 17, 1990 to Valyocsik, discloses a<br>
method for synthesizing ZSM-11 from a	<br><br>
reaction mixture containing a diquaternary ammonium<br><br>
 templatmg agent.<br><br>
      It is alleged that pure ZSM-11 has been synthesized using<br>
     tetrabutylphosphonivmt, tetrabutylammonitrai and<br>
     1,8-diaminooctane (Cg) and 1,9-diaminononane (C,) .  See P. A.<br>
Jacobs and J. A. Martens, Studies in Surface Science and        Catalysis,   33, p. 147-166.<br>
Lok et al., in Zeolites,   3, 282-291 (1983), disclose<br>
  numerous compounds which act as templating agents for the<br>
synthesis of various crystalline materials, including ZSM-  11. This article does not, however, disclose the organic<br>
 templating agent of the present invention for the synthesis<br>
  of ZSM-11.<br>
      U.S. Patent No. 5,213,786, issued May 25, 1993 to Beck<br>
        et al., discloses the synthesis of ZSM-11 using a trimethyl<br>
ammonium cation having the formula CnN+CH3)3 where n is 9,<br>
  10, 11, or 12 as the organic templating agent.  These <br>
trimethylammonium compounds are said to supply the proper<br>
pore-filling and charge density balance to produce ZSM-11 at<br>
     the expense of ZSM-5.<br>
     It has now-been found that ZSM-11 can be prepared using   3,5-DMP compounds as the templating agent and that the       resulting ZSM-11 product is in pure phase form.<br><br>
Accordingly,  the  present   invention   therefore   provides   a process  for<br>
preparing the zeolite ZSM-11 which comprises:<br>
(a) preparing an aqueous solution comprising sources of (1) an alkali metal oxide, alkaline earth metal oxide or mixtures thereof; (2) an oxide selected from the oxides of aluminum, boron, iron, gallium, indium, titanium, or mixtures thereof; (3) an oxide selected from oxides of silicon, germanium or mixtures thereof; and (4) at least one 3,5-dimethylpiperidinium compound as a templating agent having the general formula<br><br>
wherein R1and R2independently represent an alkyl group, either branched orunbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, with the proviso that R1and R2are not both methyl, or R1and R2together comprise a cyclic alkyl ring system, which, including the positively charged nitrogen atom, contains from 4 to 7 atoms, said ring system being unsubstituted or substituted with branched or unbranched alkyl groups, and X is an anion which is not detrimental to the formation of the ZSM-11; said aqueous solution comprises, in terms of mole ratios, the following:<br><br>
YO2/W2O3	15 and greater<br>
OH7Y02	0.1-0.6<br>
Q/YO2	0.01-0.50<br>
M*/Y02	0.01-0.50<br>
H2O/YO2	15-100<br>
Where Y is silicon, germanium or mixtures thereof; W is aluminum, boron, iron, gallium, indium, titanium or mixtures thereof; Q is a 3,5-dimethylpiperidinium compound; and M is an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof<br>
(b)maintaining the aqueous solution under conditions sufficient to form crystals of ZSM-11; and<br>
(c) recovering the crystals of ZSM-11.<br><br>
      The present invention also provides this process further comprising replacing alkali and/or alkaline earth metal cations of the recovered ZSM-11, at least in part, by ion exchange with a cation or mixture of cations selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and hydrogen precursors, rare earth metals, and metals from Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA,<br>
  IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VIB, and VIII of the Periodic Table of<br>
  Elements.<br>
      The present invention also provides a crystalline material   composition, as-synthesized and in the anhydrous state,   whose general formula, in terms of mole ratios, is (from        about 1 to about 50)Q:(from about 0.5 to about 25)   M2: (less than about 6.7)W203: 100 YOj wherein: Q is a<br>
3,5-dimethylpiperidinium compound; M is alkali metal cations and/or alkaline earth metal cations; W is aluminum, boron,   galliiim, indium, iron, titaniiim, or mixtures thereof; and Y        is silicon, germanium, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is also<br>
02<br>
provided the zeolite ZSM-11 having no intergrowth within its<br>
03<br>
crystalline structure of any other crystalline structure.<br>
04<br>
In particular, the zeolite ZSM-11 of this invention has no ne<br>
intergrowth of ZSM-5 crystalline structure.<br>
06<br>
07<br>
The present invention further provides the zeolite ZSM-11<br>
08<br>
having no intergrowth with itscrystalline structure of<br>
09<br>
any other crystalline structure and having the X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern of Table I or Table II below. 11<br>
12<br>
The present invention also provides the zeolite ZSM-11<br>
^^  having a SiO2Al2O3mole ratio of less than 40. 14<br>
Further provided in accordance with this invention is the<br>
zeolite ZSM-11 having a SiO2/Al203 mole ratio of less than 40<br>
17<br>
and having a cyclohexane micropore voliome of at least about<br>
^^  0.08 ml/g. 19<br>
20<br>
Among other factors, the present invention is based on the<br>
21	<br>
discovery that the zeolite ZSM-11 can be made using 3,5-dimethylpiperidiniiim compounds as the organic templating<br>
^^  agent.  It is especially surprising that, by using these<br>
3,5-dimethylpiperidinium compounds as the templating agent, ZSM-11 can be prepared in essentially pure phase form.<br>
^^  Heretofore, it has been difficult to prepare ZSM-11 using<br>
27<br>
conventional templating agents without also crystallizing<br>
28<br>
the closely related zeolite ZSM-5. Also, the present<br>
29<br>
invention permits the synthesis of ZSM-11 with relatively<br>
30<br>
low SiOj/AljOj mole ratios, i.e., on the order of 25-40.  In<br>
31<br>
addition, it has surprisingly been found that the ZSM-11<br>
32	....<br>
prepared in accordance with this invention having a<br><br>
SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio of less than 40 has a high cyclohexane<br>
02<br>
micropore volume, ie., at least about 0.08 ml/g.<br>
03<br>
04<br>

27<br>
alkaline earth metal (M) cations; an oxide of aluminum,<br>
28<br>
boron, iron, gallium, indium, titanium, or mixtures thereof<br>

32<br>
the following ranges:<br><br>
01      Reactants	General	Preferred<br>
02<br>
03	YO2/W2O3	15 and greater	25 and greater<br>
04	OH-/YO2	0.1-0.6	0.15-0.40<br>

07       H2O/YO2	15-100	20-50<br>
08<br>
09<br>
In preparing the zeolite ZSM-11 according to the present<br>
invention, the reactants and the 3,5-DMP templating agent<br>
are dissolved in water and the resulting reaction mixture is<br>
12<br>
maxntained at an elevated temperature untxl crystals are<br>
13<br>
formed.  The temperatures during the hydrothermal<br>
14<br>
crystallization step are typically maintained from about<br>
15<br>
100Â°C to about 250"C, preferably from about 140*'C to about<br>
200*'C.  The crystallization period is typically greater than<br>
17<br>
1 day and generally about 1 to about 40 days.  Preferably<br>
18<br>
the crystallization period is from about 2 to about 20 days.<br>
19<br>
20<br>
The hydrothermal crystallization is usually conducted under<br>
21<br>
pressure and usually in an autoclave so that the reaction<br>
22   .     .     .<br>
mixture is subject to autogenous pressure. The reaction<br>
23<br>
mixture can be stirred during crystallization.<br>
24<br>
25<br>
Once the crystals have formed, the solid product is<br>
26<br>
separated from the reaction mixture by standard mechanical<br>
27<br>
separation techniques, such as filtration.  The crystals are<br>
28<br>
water-washed and then dried, e.g., at 90Â°C to 150Â°C for from<br>
29<br>
8 to 24 hours, to obtain the as-synthesized zeolite<br>
30<br>
crystals.  The drying step can be performed at atmospheric<br>
or subatmospheric pressures.<br><br><br>
01	During the hydrothermal crystallization step, the crystals<br>
02 can be allowed to nucleate spontaneously from the reaction<br>
03	mixture.  The reaction mixture can also be seeded with<br>
04	ZSM-11 crystals both to direct, and accelerate the<br>
05	crystallization, as well as to minimize the formation of any<br>
06	undesired crystalline phases. When seed crystals are used,<br>
07" typically 0.1% to about 10% of the weight of silica used in<br>
08  the reaction mixture are added. 09<br>
10 Due to the unpredictability of the factors which control nucleation and crystallization in the art of crystalline oxide synthesis, not every combination of reagents, reactant<br>
13  ratios, and reaction conditions will result in crystalline products.  Selecting crystallization conditions which are effective for producing crystals may require routine 16  modifications to the reaction mixture or to the reaction conditions, such as temperature, and/or crystallization<br>
18      time.  Making these modifications are well within the<br>
19  capabilities of one skilled in the art. 20<br>
The ZSM-11 product made by the process of this invention has<br>
22	â€¢<br>
an as-synthesized composition comprising, in terms of mole<br>
23<br>
ratios in the anhydrous state, (from about 1 to about 24  50)Q: (from about 0.5 to about 25)M20: (less than about<br>
25<br>
6.7)W203: 100 YO2 where M, Q, W and Y are as defined above. 26<br>
27<br>
The ZSM-11 product was identified by its X-ray diffraction<br>
28<br>
(XRD) pattern.  The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were<br>
29<br>
determined by standard techniques.  The radiation was the<br>
30<br>
K-alpha/doublet of copper.  A scintillation counter<br>
31<br>
spectrometer with a strip-chart pen recorder was used.  The<br>
32<br>
peak heights I and the positions, as a function of 2d where<br>
33<br>
Î¸  is the Bragg angle, were read from the relative<br>
34<br><br>
01   intensities, 100 x I/I0where I0 is the intensity of the<br>
02<br>
Strongest line or peak, and d, the interplanar spacing in<br>
03<br>
Angstroms corresponding to the recorded lines, can be<br>
04<br>
calculated. 05<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern of Table I is representative<br>
07<br>
of a calcined borosilxcate ZSM-11 made in accordance with<br>
08<br>
this invention.  Minor variations in the diffraction pattern<br>
09<br>
can result from variations in the silica-to-alumina or silica-to-boron mole ratio of the particular sample due to<br>
changes in lattice constants.  In addition, sufficiently<br>
12<br>
small crystals will affect the shape and intensity of peaks,<br>
13<br>
leading to significant peak broadening.<br>

29  Calcination can also result in changes in the intensities of<br>
30	the peaks as well as minor shifts in the diffraction<br>
31	pattern.  The zeolite produced by exchanging the metal or<br>
32	Other cations present in the zeolite with various other<br>
33	cations (such as H+or NH4+) yields essentially the same<br>
34	diffraction pattern, although again, there may be minor<br><br>
shifts  in the interplanar spacing and variations  in the<br>
02<br>
relative intensities of the peaks.  Notwithstanding these<br>
03<br>
minor perturbations, the basic crystal lattice remains<br>
04<br>
unchanged by these treatments. 05<br>
06<br>
07<br>
The ZSM-ll of this invention is in pure phase form.  As used<br>
08<br>
herein, the phrase "pure phase form" refers to the fact that<br>
09<br>
the ZSM-ll of this invention is composed of crystals having<br>
only the structure of ZSM-ll, i.e., the crystals contain no other crystal structure as an intergrowth with the ZSM-ll<br>
12		<br>
Structure.  It is believed that, heretofore, although "pure" 13       ZSM-ll has been reported as having been prepared, these<br>
14<br>
materials have actually contained some amount of an 15 intergrowth of another crystal structure, typically ZSM-5.<br>
14  One of the principal advantages of this invention is that it 17      provides ZSM-ll without these intergrowths of other crystal<br>
18<br>
structures. 19<br>
20	It is believed that the peak in Tables I and II above found<br>
21	at about d = 14A demonstrates that the ZSM-ll of this<br>
22	invention is in pure phase form.  This peak is not found in<br>
23	X-ray diffraction patterns of ZSM-ll which contains ZSM-5<br>
24	intergrowth, and does appear in Tables I and II where it<br>
25	would be expected in a calculated X-ray diffraction pattern<br>
26	for pure phase ZSM-ll.  In addition, the intensities of the<br>
27	peaks in Tables I and II above are consistent with the<br>
28<br>
 intensities expected for a pure phase ZSM-ll. 29<br>
30<br>
31  The ZSM-ll of this invention can be prepared having a<br>
32	SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio lower than conventional  ZSM-ll<br>
32<br>
materials.  Thus, the ZSM-ll of this invention can be made 33<br>
34<br><br>
01      with a SiO/Al2O3 mole ratio less than 40, preferably 35 or<br>
02<br>
less, and more preferably about 30.<br>
03<br>
04	. .<br>
One surprising characteristic of the ZSM-11 of this<br>
05<br>
invention which has a SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio below 40 is that<br>
it has a high cyclohexane micropore volume.  Cyclohexane<br>
07<br>
micropore volume is measured by a method based on that<br>
08<br>
described by G. R. Landolt in Anal. Chem., Vol. 43, No.3,<br>
09<br>
613-615, 1971.  The zeolite is dried by heating overnight at<br>
650Â°F in air.  It is then loaded into ampoules, placed in<br>
the adsorption chamber and evacuated to less than one<br>
12<br>
micron.  Following this, the samples are connected to the<br>
13<br>
adsorbate, in this case cyclohexane.  The vapor pressure of<br>
14<br>
the cyclohexane is measured with a pressure transducer.  The<br>
15<br>
samples are at 22Â°C and measurements are usually made at<br>
relative partial pressure (P/PQ) of close to 0.15.  The<br>
17<br>
equilibration process usually takes 3-6 hours.  Once the<br>
18<br>
sample has equilibrated, it is removed from the chamber and<br>
19<br>
reweighed to determine the amount of cyclohexane adsorbed.<br>
20<br>
21<br>
Using the method described above, the ZSM-11 of this<br>
22<br>
invention having a Si02/Al203 mole ratio below 40 has<br>
23<br>
micropore volumes of at least about 0.08 ml/g, preferably at<br>
24<br>
least about 0.09 ml/g, and more preferably at least about<br>
25  0.10 ml/g. 26<br>
27<br>
Typically, the ZSM-11 crystalline material, is thermally<br>
28<br>
treated (calcined) prior to use as a catalyst. Usually, it<br>
29<br>
is desirable to remove the alkali metal cation by ion<br>
30<br>
exchange and replace it with hydrogen, ammonium, or any<br>
31<br>
desired metal ion.  The zeolite can be leached with<br>
32<br>
chelating agents, e.g., EDTA or dilute acid solutions, to<br>
33<br>
increase the silica/aliimina mole ratio.  The zeolite can<br>
34<br><br>
also be steamed; steaming helps stabilize the crystalline<br>
02<br>
lattice to attack from acids.  The zeolite can be used in<br>
03<br>
intimate combination with hydrogenating components, such as<br>
04<br>
tungsten, vanadium molybdenium, rhenium, nickel cobalt,<br>
chromium, manganese, or a noble metal, such as palladium or<br>
platinum, for those applications in which a hydrogenation-<br>
07<br>
dehydrogenation function is desired.  Typical replacing<br>
08<br>
cations can include hydrogen and hydrogen precursors, rare<br>
09<br>
earth metals, and metals from Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB,<br>
10  IIB, IIIB, IVB, VIB, and VIII of the Periodic Table of<br>
Elements.  Of the replacing cations, hydrogen and cations<br>
of metals such as rare earth, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pt, Pd,<br>
13      Ni, Co, Ti, Al, Sn, Ga, In and Fe are particularly<br>
preferred. 15<br>
The ZSM-ll prepared by the present process is useful in<br>
17	hydrocarbon conversion reactions.  Hydrocarbon conversion<br>
18	reactions are chemical and catalytic processes in which<br>
19	carbon containing compounds are changed to different carbon<br>
20	containing compounds.  Examples of hydrocarbon conversion<br>
21	reactions include catalytic cracking, hydrocracking,<br>
22	dewaxing, alkylation, and olefin and aromatics formation<br>
23  reactions. 24<br>
25  The following examples demonstrate but do not limit the<br>
26  present invention. 27<br>

Ion Exchange 04<br>
05  Ion-exchange of the calcined ZSM-11 material of Example 8 is executed using NH4NO3 to convert the zeolite from its Na+ to<br>
its corresponding NH4+ form, and ultimately, the Na+ form.<br>
08<br>
Typically, the same mass of NH4NO3 as zeolite is slurried in<br>
09<br>
water at a mass ratio of 25-50:1 water to zeolite.  The<br>
exchange solution is heated at 95Â°C for 2 hours and then<br>
filtered or decanted. The process can be repeated up to<br>
12<br>
three times.  Following the final exchange, the zeolite is<br>
13<br>
filtered, washed several times with water, and dried.  This<br>
14<br>
NH4-11 form of ZSM-11 can then be converted to the H+ form by<br>
15<br>
calcination as described in Example 8 to 540Â°C.<br>
