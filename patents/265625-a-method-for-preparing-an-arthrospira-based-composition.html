TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Arthrospira-based Compositions and Uses Thereof<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising Arthrospira and the<br>
use of the composition as a biocide and/or therapeutic.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Arthrospira (formerly known as Spirulina) is a cyanobacteria that is grown primarily<br>
for use as a food and/or protein source. Therapeutic uses for Arthrospira have also been<br>
described, including use as an anti-viral agent, anti-cancer agent, reducer of cholesterol,<br>
reducer of diabetes, reducer of hypertension and immunomodulator. See, for example, the<br>
references cited at the Spirulina Source.com website at<br>
http://www.spirulinasource.com/library.html.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an Arthrospira composition for<br>
use as a biocide and/or therapeutic.<br>
Physiologically Stressed Arthrospira has Biocidal Activity<br>
The present inventors have discovered that Arthrospira, when physiologically<br>
stressed, produces at least one type of bioactive agent that is active against fungi, bacteria<br>
and presumably viruses. Arthrospira can be physiologically stressed, for example, by<br>
depriving the organism of nutrients or light, or by dehydrating/drying the organism. A sign<br>
of an Arthrospira filament (trachoma) being "physiologically stressed" is when it enters<br>
an anabiotic state, in which state the filament rounds up and a thick mucoid coating is<br>
produced. The filament and/or thick mucoid coating is believed by the inventors to<br>
contain one or more bioactive agents that protect the organism against predators. One<br>
or more of the bioactives may break down the cell wall or exoskeleton of a predatory<br>
organism. One or more of the bioactive agents may be, for example, a lytic or modifying<br>
agent such as a chitinase, chitosanase or chitin deacetylase, that digests chitin, a chitin<br>
derivative (such as chitosan) or other cell wall polymer having, for example, N-<br>
acetylglucosamine or D-glucosamine as a polymer subunit. Peptidoglycan of Gram-positive<br>
bacteria is one such polymer, comprising N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
composition for digesting or modifying chitin, a chitin derivative or a polymer having<br>
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as a polymer subunit, said composition comprising<br>
physiologically stressed Arthrospira.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	_	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for digesting or modifying chitin, a chitin derivative or a polymer having N-<br>
acetyl-D-glucosamine as a polymer subunit, said method comprising the step of<br>
contacting chitin, chitin derivative or a polymer having N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as a<br>
polymer subunit with a composition comprising physiologically stressed Arthrospira.<br>
The chitin, chitin derivative or polymer can be in any suitable form. The chitin,<br>
chitin derivative or polymer can be in a substantially purified form or can be part of an<br>
organism such the cell wall of a fungus or Gram-positive bacteria, or part of the exoskeleton<br>
of an insect.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
identifying a bioactive agent from Arthrospira, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(I)	combining a composition comprising physiologically stressed Arthrospira with at<br>
least one test substrate modifiable by a bioactive agent from Arthrospira', and<br>
(II)	assaying for modification of the test substrate.<br>
Any suitable type of test substrate can be used. Assaying for modification of the test<br>
substrate can be carried out in any suitable way. High throughput screening, however, is<br>
preferred.<br>
Preferably, the bioactive agent is a chitinase, chitosanase or chitin deacetylase and<br>
the test substrate is chitin, a chitin derivative or a polymer having N-acetyl-D-glucosamine<br>
as a polymer subunit. Preferably, respirometry is used to assay modification (ie.<br>
degradation) of the chitin, chitin derivative or other polymer.<br>
The method can further comprise the step of purifying the bioactive agent.<br>
Purification can be carried out in any suitable way. The method can also comprise the steps<br>
of cloning and expressing the gene/s of the bioactive agent. These steps can be carried out in<br>
any suitable way. For instance, the steps can be as described in Maniatis, et al., Molecular<br>
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982, the entire contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by cross reference.<br>
Use of Physiologically Stressed Arthrospira as a Biocide and/or Therapeutic<br>
Chitin, chitin derivatives and glucosamine containing polymers are found<br>
throughout nature, usually as a component of a cell wall or exoskeleton of, for<br>
instance: algae, fungi, protozoans, ciliates, coelenterates, bryozoans, molluscs,<br>
annelids, arthropods, branchiopods, phoronida, pogonophora, and bacteria (Gram-<br>
positive bacteria and Rhizobia).<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
Hence, physiologically stressed Arthrospira having lytic or modifying activity<br>
against chitin, chitin derivatives and glucosamine containing polymers is potentially<br>
capable of being used as a biocide against a broad range of organisms. "Biocide" as<br>
used herein refers to either the killing of an organism or inhibition of the growth or<br>
replication of an organism (ie. the organism may not actually be killed). It is to be<br>
appreciated that some applications of the biocide will be for therapeutic purposes.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
composition for use as a biocide and/or therapeutic, said composition comprising an<br>
effective amount of physiologically stressed Arthrospira.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method for preventing or treating an infection or infestation of a subject by an<br>
organism, said method comprising the step of administering to the subject an<br>
effective amount of a composition comprising physiologically stressed Arthrospira.<br>
Preferably, the method comprises the step of identifying a subject in need of<br>
such treatment or requiring such prevention.<br>
There is also provided the use of physiologically stressed Arthrospira in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of an infection or<br>
infestation of a subject by an organism.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have found that taking Arthrospira from its growth<br>
environment may be enough for physiological stressing to occur and for inducing expression<br>
of one or more bioactive agents having biocidal activity. That is, steps for physiologically<br>
stressing Arthrospira as taught in the specifications of New Zealand Patents No. 336620 and<br>
336619 need not be carried out and the Arthrospira need not be further processed<br>
(disrupted, explosively decompressed, potentiated, milled, rehydrated in sodium bicarbonate<br>
or freeze dried) in order for there to be biocidal activity.<br>
Furthermore, all commercially available preparations (tablets, capsules and powders)<br>
of Arthrospira that have thus far been tested by the inventors have been found to have<br>
activity against a substrate, and that activity is believed to be indicative of biocidal activity.<br>
Such preparations are usually prepared by harvesting the Arthrospira, washing and drying<br>
the Arthrospira, without a step for specifically stressing the organism. In fact, commercial<br>
growers of Arthrospira tend to minimise stressing of the organism as much as possible as the<br>
thick mucoid coating tends to clog machinery for processing the organism.<br>
For any one or more of the compositions described herein, the Arthrospira can be<br>
any suitable species, or mixture of species or Arthrospira variants including, but not limited<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
to, A. maxima. It is to be pointed out that Arthrospira and Spirulina are two separate genera.<br>
The separation between these two genera has been repeatedly affirmed on the basis of many<br>
characteristics including: helicity and trichome size, cell wall structure and pore pattern, gas<br>
vacuoles, thylakoid pattern, trichome motility and fragmentation, GC content,<br>
oligonucleotide catalogue of 16S rRNA, and mutations in the cpcB-cpcA locus. See, for<br>
instance, J. F. Manen and J. Falquet (2002) "The cpcB-cpcA locus as a tool for the genetic<br>
characterization of the genus Arthrospira (Cyanobacteria): evidence for horizontal transfer".<br>
International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, Vol 52, 861-867; and,<br>
Chapter 1: Morphology, Ultrastructure and Taxonomy of Arthrospira (Spirulina) Maxima<br>
and Arthrospira (Spirulina) Platensis by Luisa Tomaselli, of Spirulina platensis<br>
(Arthrospira)'. Physiology, Cell-biology and Biotechnology. Taylor and Francis. Avigad<br>
Vonshak (Ed) 1997. The compositions described in this specification exclude species of the<br>
Spirulina genus.<br>
The composition can comprise intact Arthrospira filaments, segments of the<br>
filaments, disrupted/lysed segments or extracts/fractions thereof. The composition can<br>
comprise Arthrospira that is alive or that is not alive. Preferably, the composition<br>
comprises disrupted Arthrospira filaments and segments.<br>
The Arthrospira-based composition can be prepared in any suitable way, provided<br>
that the biocidal activity is not compromised. Normally, this would involve the steps of: (I)<br>
growing Arthrospira in any suitable way; (II) harvesting the grown Arthrospira in any<br>
suitable way; and (III) drying the Arthrospira in any suitable way. Optional steps include:<br>
additionally physiologically stressing the Arthrospira in any suitable way; disrupting the<br>
filaments and segments in any suitable way, sterilising the organism in any suitable way,<br>
decolourising the Arthrospira in any suitable way, removing or degrading the chlorophyll in<br>
any suitable way, and milling the dried Arthrospira.<br>
Some of the above steps are described, for example, in the specifications of New<br>
Zealand Patents No. 336620 and 336619, the entire contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein by cross reference. For example, stressing can be carried out at the time of harvest by<br>
either depriving the Arthrospira of essential nutrients (nutrient diminution) or light for a<br>
period sufficient to stress it but not kill it by management of the growing conditions.<br>
Stressing can also be by partial desiccation or by harvesting the Arthrospira and keeping it<br>
alive in damp conditions until stressed but not dead. For example, Arthrospira can be spray<br>
dried to form a fine powder of disrupted cells. Spray drying may take place, for example, at<br>
50-190°C for a few seconds. For example, drying can be carried out in any suitable way,<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	r	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
including by cyclonic drying, heat pump drying, heat tube drying, refractory drying or<br>
thermal drying under about 67°C for short periods of time. For example, filaments can be<br>
disrupted using milling or explosive decompression as described in New Zealand Patents<br>
No. 328013 and No. 328740, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by cross<br>
reference.<br>
The concentration of Arthrospira in the composition can vary depending on the<br>
application, eg. anywhere from about 0.01% to about 100%. The composition can include<br>
any suitable solvent, carrier, base, excipient, filler, binder, plasticiser, emulsifier, stabiliser,<br>
lubricant, buffering agent, emollient, solubilising agent, suspending agent, thickener,<br>
fragrance, colourant and preservative.<br>
Depending on the intended use, the composition can further comprise one or more<br>
actives not derived from Arthrospira, such as antimicrobials (e.g. bactericides or<br>
antifungals), therapeutic agents (e.g. wound healers, steroids) or general nutrients (e.g.<br>
amino acids, vitamins). Such actives are well known in the art.<br>
The composition can be in any suitable form. The composition can be administered<br>
or applied in any suitable way. The composition can be a liquid, gel or solid, or a mixture<br>
thereof. The composition can be a liquid culture of Arthrospira which is applied as a spray.<br>
Alternatively, the composition can be a powder which is evenly distributed over a target<br>
site by shake or puffer application. The infected or infested subject can be dipped<br>
into a bath containing a liquid form of the composition. The composition and method<br>
of application or administration can be as described in the specifications of New<br>
Zealand Patents No. 336620 and 336619.<br>
For therapeutic use, the composition can be administered or applied, for example,<br>
orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally or vaginally.<br>
The composition can be a tablet, solution, aerosol, spray, cream, ointment, lotion, emulsion,<br>
gel or powder. The composition can be in the form of an Arthrospira-impregnated<br>
bandage, dressing, adhesive plaster, suppository, pessary or poultice.<br>
Preferably, the biocide is active against fungi, Gram-positive bacteria,<br>
protozoa, viruses, crustaceans, acari and insects, some of which are addressed in<br>
more detail below.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
preparing an Arthrospira-based composition for use as a biocide and/or therapeutic, said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
(1) physiologically stressing Arthrospira; and<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	^	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
(2) combining the stressed Arthrospira of (1) with a suitable carrier, solvent, base or<br>
excipient.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
preparing an Arthrospira-based composition for use as a biocide and/or therapeutic, said<br>
method comprising the steps:<br>

which the Arthrospira is being grown;<br>
(2)	washing the stressed Arthrospira in order to remove contaminants;<br>
(3)	drying the washed Arthrospira; and<br>
(4)	combining the washed Arthrospira with a suitable carrier, solvent, base or excipient.<br>
Either of the above methods can be used to prepare one or more of the compositions<br>
described herein.<br>
Preferably, the above methods exclude specific steps of explosive decompression<br>
and/or freeze drying the physiologically stressing Arthrospira prior to adding the carrier,<br>
solvent, base or excipient<br>

Any suitable concentration of monographed active can be used and will depend on the<br>
intended use for the composition.<br>
Use of Physiologically Stressed Arthrospira as an Antibacterial<br>
Physiologically stressed Arthrospira has been found by the inventors to be an<br>
effective antibacterial against Gram-positive bacteria. The mode of antibacterial action is not<br>
clearly understood. It is possible that cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria are lysed or<br>
otherwise modified by one or more bioactives from Arthrospira. The cell walls contain<br>
peptidoglycan (comprising N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid) and<br>
peptidoglycan may be digestible by one or more of the bioactives.<br>
According to a twelfth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
composition for use as an antibacterial, said composition comprising an effective<br>
amount of physiologically stressed Arthrospira.<br>
According to a thirteenth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>

made structure, a building, building material, a stream, a lake or wetlands.<br>
Use of Arthrospira as a Therapeutic<br>
When using physiologically stressed Arthrospira as a biocide and/or therapeutic on<br>
skin, the inventors have found that one or more other substituents of Arthrospira interact<br>
synergistically with the one or more bioactive agents to promote healing of the skin. These<br>
other substituents are likely to include: beta-carotene, which provides nourishment to the<br><br>

including vitamins, minerals, trace elements, anti-oxidants, essential oils and carbohydrates.<br>
First, the stressed Arthrospira inhibits or kills the microbe - be it a fungus, bacteria or<br>
virus - and then other substituents of Arthrospira repair the damage caused by the microbe.<br>
The present inventors have found that Arthrospira has therapeutic qualities even<br>
when not physiologically stressed, such as in the treatment of skin conditions and in skin<br>
repair.<br>

BEST MODE AND OTHER MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
By way of illustration only, preferred embodiments of the present invention are<br>
described in detail, with reference to the following series of examples.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of Physiologically Stressed Arthrospira<br>
A culture of Arthrospira maxima (obtainable from Biovite Australia Pty Ltd) was<br>
stressed by nutrient diminution or partial desiccation. The Arthrospira was dewatered<br>
and dried to form an "unprocessed" powder. Dried Arthrospira was then explosively<br>
decompressed (potentiated) using the method described in New Zealand Patents No. 328013<br>
and No. 328740. The Arthrospira was re-hydrated, decolourised, dried and milled to form a<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	^	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
dry "premix powder". The premix powder was then dispersed in a suitable carrier (eg.<br>
commercially available aqueous British Pharmacopoeia cream or water). The premix powder<br>
is referred to as "AMYCOT® premix powder".<br>
Example 2 - Characterisation of Activity of Stressed Arthrospira<br>
The results of respirometry suggest that physiologically stressed Arthrospira is<br>
capable of modifying or lysing substrates comprising chitin, chitosan and/or N-acetyl-D-<br>
glucosamine.<br>
Chitin Substrate<br>
Standard amounts of AMYCOT® premix powder and the unprocessed powder were<br>
separately reacted with four-unit polymer BHD chitin (Sigma, catalogue number C7170) in a<br>
Warburg Respirometer using standard techniques. Each composition was mixed together<br>
with chitin and the quantity of gas evolved was measured. The reaction was monitored for<br>
one-hour following equilibration for 30 minutes. The same composition, but pre-boiled in a<br>
water bath for five minutes, did not produce any gas which suggested that the activity could<br>
be enzymic and could be due to one or more types of denaturable proteins.<br>
The results are plotted in Figure 1. The rate of activity (presumably enzymatic<br>
activity) of unprocessed powder was 694.9 ml/g cellular material/g substrate/hour. The rate<br>
of activity of AMYCOT® premix powder was 729.65 ml/g cellular material /g<br>
substrate/hour.<br>
Respirometry was also used to identify the optimum temperature for the activity.<br>
AMYCOT® premix powder (0.02 g and 0.06 g) was incubated with chitin (0.02 g) at 20°C,<br>
30°C, 33°C and 40°C. AMYCOT® premix powder in a cream based (0.05 g) was also<br>
incubated with chitin (0.02 g) at those temperatures. The results are plotted in Figure 29.<br>
The optimum temperature for the activity in each case was determined to be 33°C.<br>
Respirometry was also used to identify the optimum pH for the activity.<br>
AMYCOT® premix powder (0.02 g) was suspended in buffers of varying pH (60-70%<br>
ethanol, 30-40% water, 0-0.05% phenolphthalein, 0-0.03% bromothymol blue, 0-0.02%<br>
methyl red, sodium salt, 0-0.01% sodium hydroxide and 0-0.01% methyl orange, sodium salt<br>
at pH 5, 7,9 and 11) and was incubated with chitin (0.02 g) at 33°C. The results are plotted<br>
in Figure 30. The optimum pH for activity was determined to be 6.<br>
These results suggest that the bioactive agent or agents should have activity when<br>
topically applied to skin as skin has a similar temperature and pH.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	'	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and Chitosan Substrates<br>
AMYCOT® premix powder (0.02g) was separately incubated with N-acetyl-D-<br>
glucosamine (0.02g, Sigma catalogue number A8625-5G) and chitosan (0.02g, Sigma<br>
catalogue number C3646) substrates in a Warburg Respirometer at 33°C. Each reaction was<br>
monitored for one-hour following equilibration for 30 minutes.<br>
The results for AMYCOT® plus N-acetyl-D-glucosamine are presented in the table<br>
below.<br><br>
These results suggest that physiologically stressed Arthrospira has one or more<br>
bioactive agents that lyse or modify chitin, chitosan and/or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, or<br>
possibly another type of polymer having N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as a polymer subunit. The<br>
bioactive agent could be, for instance, a chitinase, chitosanase or chitin deacetylase.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	l^	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
Example 3 - Antifungal and Antibacterial Activity of Stressed Arthrospira<br>
The biocidal activity of AMYCOT® premix powder was tested in vitro on live fungi<br>
and Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
Live cultures of target pathogens were sourced from the American Type Culture<br>
Collection (ATCC), the Australian Collection of Microorganisms (ACM) and Sullivan<br>
Niccolaides. The cultures that were tested are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
A uniform lawn of each pathogen was grown on a dish containing Potato Dextrose<br>
Agar (PDA) medium. After 3-4 days of incubation, four wells were cut in the PDA medium<br>
with a sterile 8 mm diameter cork borer. Measured amounts of AMYCOT® premix powder<br>
and control creams/powders were placed in each well. The dishes were cultured at<br>
conditions appropriate for the respective pathogen and the dishes were inspected daily.<br>
After 2-4 days two concentric zones around the well were evident:<br>
1.	A smaller transparent circular "clearance" zone around a well. This is an area<br>
where fungi have been destroyed, leaving only residual dry cytoplasmic matter (as seen by<br>
light and electron microscopy).<br>
2.	A larger semitransparent "affected" zone extending from the perimeter of the<br>
clearance zone. The affected zone is recognised by the lesser height of the lawn, its lesser<br>
density and greater transparency compared with unaffected lawn.   This is an area where<br>
fungi cell walls have been largely destroyed, but that some are still present, often as rounded<br>
cytoplasmic spheres (as seen by light and electron microscopy).<br>
Measurement of the zones is taken from the outside perimeter of the well to the<br>
outside perimeter of the zone in each case. This measurement is referred to as the zonal<br>
distance (ZD). The radius of the zones is a non-linear measure of the efficacy of the biocidal<br>
agent/s against the pathogen in vitro.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	K	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
The in vitro control results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows clearance of Canada albicans (ACM 4574) using AMYCOT®,<br>
which is evidence of the efficacy of one or more biocidal agents against the condition thrush.<br>
AMYCOT® premix powder is at the 6 o'clock position and a "human trial cream" having<br>
12.5% w/w AMYCOT® in an aqueous cream is at the 12 o'clock position (ZD of 9 mm).<br>
In the case of the anaerobic acne-causing bacteria Propionibacterium acne, no<br>
clearance was obtained when tested under anaerobic conditions. An explanation for this is<br>
provided in Example 4.<br>
Example 4 - Antibacterial Activity of Stressed Arthrospira on Propionibacterium acne<br>
Respirometry showed that AMYCOT® has antibacterial activity against P. acne.<br>
AMYCOT® premix powder (0.02g) and 5g "human trial cream" comprising 12.5%<br>
w/w AMYCOT® were separately reacted with a broth of the anaerobic acne-causing<br>
organism P. acne (ACM No. 5109) in a Warburg Respirometer in the presence or absence of<br>
oxygen. The results were compared with those of a control comprising P. acne broth devoid<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	'^	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
of AMYCOT®. In the absence of oxygen, no gas was liberated. In the presence of oxygen,<br>
gas was liberated and each composition had antibacterial activity.<br>
The results for AMYCOT® and human trial cream in the presence of oxygen are<br>
plotted in Figure 3. The (presumably enzymatic) rate of AMYCOT® premix powder was<br>
626.00 ml/g cellular material/g substrate/hour. The rate of human trial cream was 12.00 ml/g<br>
cellular material/g substrate/hour.<br>
The results showed that in order for the composition to work as an antibacterial on P.<br>
acne in vivo, the presence of oxygen is required. Therefore, at least one of the biocidal<br>
agents may be an oxidase.<br>
The inventors suspect that one or more of the biocidal agents against fungi may lyse<br>
or modify the cellular wall of fungi. Such an agent may be a chitinase, chitosanase or chitm<br>
deacetylase.<br>
Although P. acne and other Gram-positive bacteria are not believed to have chitin or<br>
chitosan in their cellular walls, it is suspected that one or more biocidal agents lyse or<br>
modify N-acetyl-D-glucosamine/peptidoglycans in the bacterial cell wall.<br>
Example 5 - Different Commercial Sources of Arthrospira have Antifungal Activity<br>
Commercial preparations of dried Arthrospira (powders, tablets and capsules) were<br>
sourced from different suppliers in different jurisdictions and tested for antifungal activity.<br>
The powders are typically prepared by harvesting Arthrospira, washing the harvested<br>
Arthrospira, and drying the washed Arthrospira. Some suppliers mill the Arthrospira whilst<br>
wet. Preparation does not entail the step of specifically stressing Arthrospira post-harvest<br>
such that the Arthrospira enter the anabiotic state. In fact, as mentioned before, commercial<br>
growers of Arthrospira tend to minimise stressing of the organism as much as possible as the<br>
thick mucoid coating tends to clog machinery for processing the organism.<br>
Arthrospira (Spirulina) powders were obtained from the following suppliers:<br>
1.	China Spirulina - Jiangsu Cibainian Nutrition Food Co., Ltd. China<br>
2.	Febico-Far East Biotech Co. Ltd. Taiwan<br>
3.	Life Stream/Earthrise - DIC. California USA<br>
4.	Pacifica - Cyanotech. Hawaii USA<br>
5.	Siam Algae Co. - DIC. Thailand<br>
6.	Spirin -Yunnan Spirin Co. Ltd. China<br>
7.	Synergy - DIC. China<br>
Each powder was mixed in an aqueous cream using 12.5% w/w concentration.  Each<br>
cream was then decolourised. A uniform lawn of T. rubrum was grown on PDA medium in<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	' *%	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
a dish. After 3-4 days of incubation, wells were cut in the PDA medium with a sterile cork<br>
borer. Measured amounts of each cream were placed in a respective well, the dishes were<br>
then incubated for 2-4 days.<br>
Figure 4 shows the antifungal activities of 12.5% w/w Siam Algae Co. (3 o'clock<br>
position), 12.5% w/w Life Stream (6 o'clock position), and 12.5% w/w China Spirulina (9<br>
o'clock position).<br>
The results showed that all commercial powders tested had some antifungal activity.<br>
Respirometry confirmed that all commercial powders tested also had activity (presumably<br>
enzymatic) when incubated with chitin (results not shown).<br>
One powder (Life Stream) was randomly selected for blending with an over-the-counter<br>
aqueous cream at a concentration of 12.5% w/w without further processing and tested for<br>
antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger. The cream produced a clearance of 4 mm, as<br>
seen in Figure 5 at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. This indicated that possibly all<br>
commercial preparations of dried Arthrospira were likely to have some level of antifungal<br>
activity, without requiring an additional stressing step or farther processing step such as<br>
filament disruption.<br>
Example 6 - Activity of Stressed Arthrospira Against Fungal Diseases of Mammals<br>
The antifungal activity of AMYCOT® was tested in vitro against different fungal<br>
diseases of mammals. The following pathogens were sourced from the Department of<br>

●	Trichophyton rubrum<br>
●	Epidermophytonfloccosum<br>
●	Fusarium graminearum<br>
●	Alternaria sp.<br>
●	Malassezia furfur<br>
A uniform lawn of each pathogen was grown on PDA medium. After 1-2 days of<br>
incubation, wells were cut in the PDA medium with a sterile 8 mm diameter cork borer.<br>
Measured amounts of AMYCOT® were placed in each well. The plates were cultured at an<br>
appropriate temperature depending on the pathogen. The welled plates were inspected daily.<br>
The clearance was measured after 2-3 days. Measurement of the zone is taken from the<br>
perimeter of the well to the outside perimeter of the zone.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	'	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
This zone was void of live fungal cells proving efficacy of AMYCOT® against the<br>
target pathogens.<br>

mm of the pathogen T. rubrum.<br>
Figure 9b shows a well of 5% w/w AMYCOT® shampoo produced a clearance of 4<br>
mm of the pathogen C. albicans.<br>
Example 7 - Activity of Stressed Arthrospira Against Fungal Diseases of Plants<br>
The antifungal activity of AMYCOT® was tested in vitro against different fungal<br>
diseases of plants. The following pathogens were sourced from the Department of Primary<br>
Industries, Department of Agriculture, ACM and nurseries:<br>
●	Fusarium graminearum<br>
●	Pithomyces Chartarum<br>
●	Botrytis cinerea<br>
●	Alternaria sp.<br>
A uniform lawn of each pathogen was grown on PDA medium. After 1-2 days of<br>
incubation, wells were cut in the PDA medium with a sterile 8 mm diameter cork borer.<br>
Measured amounts of AMYCOT® were placed in each well. The plates were cultured at an<br>
appropriate temperature depending on the pathogen. The welled plates were inspected daily.<br>
The clearance was measured after 2-3 days. Measurement of the zone was taken<br>
from the perimeter of the well to the outside perimeter of the zone.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	2-®	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
The zone was void of live fungal cells proving efficacy of AMYCOT® against the<br>
target pathogens.<br>
12.5% w/w AMYCOT® cream produced a clearance of 13 mm of the pathogen F<br>
graminearum. F. graminearum is a causal agent of head blight and crown rot in small grain.<br>
Figure 10 shows a well of 12.5% w/w AMYCOT® cream produced a clearance of 10<br>
mm of the pathogen P. chartarum. P. chartarum is a causal agent of facial eczema in sheep<br>
cattle.<br>
12.5% w/w AMYCOT® cream produced a clearance of 8 mm of the pathogen B.<br>
cinerea. B. cinerea is a causal agent of botrytis in fruit.<br>
12.5% w/w AMYCOT® cream produced a clearance of 9 mm of the pathogen<br>
Alternaria sp, the casual agent of leaf spot in fruit.<br>
Example 8 - Testing of AMYCOT® as a Spray on Plant Fungal Pathogens<br>
AMYCOT® in the form of an antifungal spray was tested in vitro against a common<br>
plant pathogen, Botrytis cinerea. 5% w/w AMYCOT® powder was hydrated with water, but<br>
was only sparingly soluble.<br>
A uniform lawn of B. cinerea was grown on PDA medium in a dish. The right-hand<br>
side of the dish was then sprayed with the spray and allowed to sit at room temperature for<br>
24 hours. The left-hand side of the dish was not sprayed. Figure 11 shows that the sprayed<br>
side of the dish had dead fungi. The spray was effective in eliminating botrytis and<br>
inhibiting further sporulation.<br>
Example 9 -In Vitro Antimicrobial Tests with Stressed Arthrospira and Monographed<br>
Actives<br>
The antifungal and antibacterial activities of various over-the-counter fungal and<br>
antibacterial creams (including Lamisil™, Dakta Gold™, Canesten™, Tinaderm™,<br>
Daktarin™, Tripod Labs™, Resolve Tinea™, Resolve Balm™, Resolve Plus™, Clearasil™,<br>
Benzac W™) and AMYCOT® were tested in this and other examples.<br>
In this example, the antifungal and antibacterial activities of various over-the-counter<br>
creams and AMYCOT® were tested by an independent laboratory (ConMac Laboratory<br>
Services) against the target pathogens Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton<br>
floccosum, Trichophyton rubrum andPropionibacterium acne.<br>
The results are shown in Table 6.<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	7-Q\	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
The results show that only AMYCOT® was active against each pathogen. The only<br><br>
Example 10 - In Vitro Tests with Monographed Actives and Combinations with<br>
AMYCOT®<br>
Antifungals such as miconazole, tolnaftate, bifonazole and clotrimazole work by<br>
inhibiting specific protein production, preventing normal functions such as reproduction.<br>
The antifungal terbinafine works by preventing the formation of vital sterols.<br>
The first aim of these in vitro tests was to determine the efficacies of various over-<br>
the-counter creams or their actives as fungal inhibitors and to compare the efficacy of<br>
AMYCOT®. The second aim was to determine the efficacy of AMYCOT® in combination<br>
with one or more of the over-the-counter creams or their actives as fungal inhibitors.<br>
Sabouraud's liquid medium was inoculated with the chosen pathogen. The broths<br>
were then incubated for one week at 28°C. A sterile swab was dipped into a broth of the<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
pathogen, and a PDA medium plate was inoculated by streaking the plate at right angles,<br>
insuring that the plate had an even lawn.<br>
Monographed actives not already in a cream base were mixed with a respective<br>
cream base. A select cream was placed onto a 10 mm diameter filter paper disc and the disc<br>
was placed onto a newly inoculated plate. Up to four different discs were placed on a plate.<br>
The plate was then incubated for 24-48 hours at the appropriate temperature depending on<br>
the pathogen. Photos were then taken at the completion of the 24-48 hours.<br>
The inhibitory test results are shown in Figures 12-21 and in Tables 7-16 below.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/047830	^	PCT/AU2005/001693<br><br><br>
WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
The monographed actives in Figure 21 are in an aqueous cream base as opposed to a<br>
spirit base which is normally used.<br>
In the in vitro tests miconazole and clotrimazole were seen as being the most<br>
effective inhibitors of pathological fungi, (see Figures 12-21). Figures 16 and 17 and Tables<br>
11 and 12 establish that miconazole is an effective fungal inhibitor. AMYCOT® also acts as<br>
an inhibitor, but is only approximately 40% as effective as clotrimazole and miconazole (see<br>
Figures 12-14). Figures 18-21 and Tables 13-16 suggest that the combinations of<br>
AMYCOT® plus miconazole and AMYCOT® plus clotrimazole are the most effective<br>
fungal inhibitors in vitro when compared to terbinafine and tolnaftate.<br>
The third aim of these in vitro tests was to determine the efficacies of various over-<br>
the-counter creams or their actives as fungicides and to compare the efficacy of<br>
AMYCOT®. The fourth aim was to determine the efficacy of AMYCOT® in combination<br>
with monographed actives.<br>
The fungicidal test involved growing a lawn of the pathogen on PDA medium plates<br>
over a 2-3 day period and then exposing the mature pathogen to the antirungals. This was<br>
done by cutting wells into the lawned agar, and removing the agar and filling the wells with<br>
cream.<br>
The fungicidal test results are shown in Figures 22-28 and Tables 17-23 below.<br><br><br>

WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
The monographed actives in Figure 28 are in an aqueous cream base as opposed to a<br>
spirit base which is normally used.<br>
The results support that the present over-the-counter antifungals and monographed<br>
actives are fungi-static agents and not fungicides. Figures 22-28 and Tables 17-23<br>
demonstrate that AMYCOT® is an efficacious fungicide, even when combined with<br>
monographed actives.<br>
The combination of AMYCOT® with either miconazole or clotrimazole did not<br>
greatly reduce the efficacies of either. The combination increased the inhibitory effect (see<br>
Figures 17-21). This created a very effective broad spectrum product.<br>
The combination of AMYCOT® with clotrimazole slightly inhibited the antifungal<br>
activity of AMYCOT® (see Figures 22-28), but the combination of AMYCOT® with<br>
miconazole had no great detrimental effects on the inhibitory or the fungicidal activity of the<br>
combination cream (see Figures 17-26).<br>
The combination cream of AMYCOT® and miconazole was more efficacious as a<br>
broad spectrum product than either due to the inhibitory nature of miconazole and both the<br>
inhibitory and fungicidal activities of AMYCOT®.<br>
The combination cream acted as an inhibitor and then "held its ground", while<br>
clearances achieved with miconazole alone became encroached by regrowth as in the case of<br>
the pathogen T. mentagrophytes (see Figure 20).<br>
It was also found that the combination cream AMYCOT® and 2% miconazole<br>
restricted regrowth of the pathogen after a clearance was made around the wells.<br>
Example 11 - Trials of Arthrospira on Various Skin Conditions<br>
A subject had advanced athlete's foot, with deep lesions between the toes. The<br>
subject reported that itching caused by the fungus stopped within 15 minutes of first<br>
applying 12.5% w/w AMYCOT® cream. Inflammation reduced and in some cases<br>
disappeared completely in 12 hours. The lesions began closing within 24 hours and<br>
completely healed within 4-5 days.<br>
These observations were repeated in the case of acne with subjects recording that the<br>
associated inflammation disappeared and that their skin returned to normal colour and<br>
became soft and pliable like new skin. The pustules also dried out<br>
It is the belief of the inventors that one or more biocidal agents (eg. chitinase,<br>
chitosanase, chitin deacetylase) interact synergistically with other components of<br>
Arthrospira to give rise to the therapeutic effects. The itching in fungal infections is an<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
indication of the release of digestive enzymes or metabolites from the fungi. Once normal<br>
fungal metabolism is disrupted as the cell wall is disrupted, itching ceases.<br>
Similar results were obtained when using the cream for conditions unrelated to<br>
fungus, on dry and cracked heels and elbows, rosacea, eczema, sun damaged skin and<br>
psoriasis. Subjects reported almost immediate relief from itching in dermatitis.<br>
Example 12 - Antifungal Activity of Stressed Arthrospira Using "Unprocessed" Powder<br>
Example 5 supported that commercial preparations of dried Arthrospira were likely<br>
to have some level of antifungal activity without requiring an additional stressing step or<br>
post-harvest processing step such as filament disruption. Example 12 further supports this<br>
finding.<br>
A dried preparation of Arthrospira maxima was sourced from a commercial grower.<br>
The preparation was blended with an over-the-counter aqueous cream at a concentration of<br>
12.5% w/w without further processing, and was tested for antifungal activity against T.<br>
mentagrophytes, T. rubrum and M.fructicola (as described in Example 5).<br>
As seen in Figure 31, the cream produced a clearance against T. mentagrophytes at<br>
the 12,3,6 and 9 o'clock positions.<br>
As seen in Figure 32, the cream produced a clearance against 71 rubrum at the 6<br>
o'clock position.<br>
As seen in Figure 33, the cream produced a clearance against M. fructicola at the 6<br>
o'clock position.<br>
These findings support that post-harvest steps such as explosive decompression, dry<br>
freezing, decolourisation and milling need not be carried out in order to produce Arthrospira<br>
having fungicidal activity.<br>
Example 13 - Antifungal Activity of Arthrospira Not Explosively Decompressed<br>
This example further supports that the post-harvesting step of explosive<br>
decompression (potentiation) is not required in order to produce Arthrospira having<br>
fungicidal activity.<br>
A dry preparation of Arthrospira maxima was sourced from a commercial grower. In<br>
one instance, dried Arthrospira was disrupted by explosive decompression (potentiated)<br>
using the method described in New Zealand Patents No. 328013 and No. 328740. The<br>
Arthrospira was re-hydrated, decolourised, dried and milled to form a dry "premix powder".<br>
The premix powder was then suspended in a suitable carrier (12.5%) and will be referred to<br>
as "potentiated AMYCOT®".<br><br>
WO 2006/047830	2&amp;	PCT/AU2005/001693<br>
In another instance, the preparation excluded the explosive decompression method<br>
described in New Zealand Patents No. 328013 and No. 328740, and this preparation will be<br>
referred to as "original AMYCOT®".<br>
As seen in Figure 34, both "original AMYCOT®" and "potentiated AMYCOT®"<br>
produced almost equal clearances against Alternaria sp. at the 12 and 7 o'clock positions,<br>
respectively. Hence, explosive decompression is not an essential post-harvest step for<br>
producing Arthrospira having fungicidal activity.<br>
It will be further appreciated that many changes can be made to the compositions,<br>
methods of use and preparation exemplified above without departing from the broad ambit<br>
and scope of the invention.<br>
