CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a completion application of copending U.S.<br>
provisional application Serial No.60/178,626, filed January 28, 2000, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to chemiluminescent compounds and<br>
methods of use therefor. More particularly, the present invention<br>
concerns novel stabilized chemiluminescent formulations containing<br>
all the necessary components for chemiluminescence light<br>
generation. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
single or one-part reagent for detecting and quantifying various<br>
biological molecules through chemiluminescence as well as detecting<br>
DNA fragments in DNA sequencing applications and methods of use<br>
therefore.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Radioimmunoassay has provided the most practical approach to<br>
achieve detection of antigens and antibodies in picomolar<br>
concentrations and is, thereforee, widely used in both clinical and<br>
pharmacological laboratories. However, the very success and<br>
widespread use of radioimmunoassays has raised several problems<br>
which include: (1) shelf-life and stability of radiolabeled compounds,<br>
(2) high cost of radioactive waste disposal, and (3) health hazards as<br>
a result of exposure to the use of not only radioactive materials but to<br>
the solvent necessary for liquid-scintillation counting, as well.<br>
Chemiluminescence, i.e. the production of light by chemical<br>
reaction, and bioluminescence, i.e. the light produced by some living<br>
organisms, have been tested as potential replacements for<br>
radioactive labels, not only in competitive and sandwich-type<br>
immunoassays, but also, DNA sequencing and other related<br>
research. Chemiluminescence provides a major advantage over<br>
radioactive labeling because it generates cold light i.e. its generated<br>
light is not caused by vibrations of atoms and / or molecules involved<br>
in the reaction but by direct transformation of chemicals into<br>
electronic energy. Thus, research on the chemiluminescence of<br>
organic compounds is an on-going area of major emphasis.<br>
Parenthetically, chemiluminescence is also advantageous in<br>
detecting and measuring trace elements and pollutants for<br>
environmental control. The best known chemiluminescent reactions<br>
are those which employ either stabilized enzmye triggerable 1,2-<br>
dioxetanes, acridanes, acridinium esters, iuminol, isoluminol and<br>
derivatives thereof or lucigenin, as the chemical agent, reactant or<br>
substrate.<br>
Enzymatic triggerable 1,2-dioxetanes such as those described by<br>
A.P. Schaap, R.S. Handley and B.P. Gin. Tetrahedron Lett.. 935<br>
(1987); A.P. Schaap, T.S. Chen, R.S. Handley, R. DeSilva, and B.P.<br>
Gin, Tetrahedron Lett.. 1159 (1987) as well as in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,707,550 and PCT/US99/20590 are superior in immunoassays and<br>
other related applications compared to presently known peroxidase<br>
substrates such as Iuminol and the like, because these 1,2-dioxetane<br>
substrates are highly sensitive and detect an enzyme concentration<br>
up to 1021'M in solution, as well as on a membrane. Futher,<br>
stabilized 1,2-dioxetane substrates provide high signal, low<br><br>
background, wide dynamic range, rapid results and excellent<br>
reproducibility.<br>
On the other hand, peroxidase is widely distributed in higher<br>
plants and in especially high concentrations in fig sap and<br>
horseradish. It is also found in some animal tissues and in<br>
microorganisms. Because of its wide availability, horseradish<br>
peroxidase(HRP) is widely used in labeling haptens, antibodies,<br>
protein A/G, avidin. streptavidin and DNA for enzyme immunoassays,<br>
immunocytochemistry, immunoblot and DNA detection.<br>
In an assay procedure, HRP is used in lieu of the enzymatic<br>
triggerable dioxetane because detection of enzyme activity takes<br>
advantage of the reactive cooperation between the enzyme and a<br>
highly sensitive chemiluminescent agent. Peroxidase-based<br>
chemiluminescent assays, while demonstrating improved detection<br>
sensitivity, suffer from the lack of reproducibility such that the<br>
obtained data is not always reliable.<br>
According to the prior art, two problems arise in the detection of<br>
peroxidase activity. First, a HRP assay is employed as either a two<br>
component reaction system or a two step reaction process. See,<br>
inter alia U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,598,044; 5,171,668; 5,206,149; 5,552,298;<br>
5,601,977; 5,593,845; 5,670,644; 5,723,295 . The two component<br>
system provides two reagents, one reagent containing an organic<br>
compound for light production such as luminol and the second an<br>
oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide. When the two are mixed<br>
together, peroxidase enzyme detection occurs. However, the<br>
resulting solution, after mixing, is not stable for a long period of time<br>
and due to the instability of the mixed reagent the background is very<br>
high. Indeed, the chemiluminescence of most of the prior art<br>
systems is like a flash or a glow for a short period of time. Further, in<br>
a two-step chemiluminescence reaction process, the first step, i.e.<br>
the peroxidase catalyzed reaction, is done at a lower pH than the<br>
3<br>
second step of the reaction. This causes accumulation of an<br>
intermediate compound which is subsequently induced to produce a<br>
burst of light by raising the pH of the solution. Thus, the multistep<br>
nature of peroxidase-catalyzed luminescent reaction, with rate<br>
limiting steps and competing side reactions, creates several<br>
problems in efficiency and reproducibility when used in the<br>
immunological field. The second problem is the lost activity of the<br>
peroxidase enzyme in buffers. The stock solutions of peroxidase<br>
below 10 ng/ml are not stable, even in the presence of bovine serum<br>
albumin. For example, at 10 pg/ml, activity is lost within one minute,<br>
and even at 1 ng/ml, the solution is stable for not more than two<br>
minutes. See K. Pugnet, A.M. Michelson, and S. Avrameas, Anal.<br>
Biochem. 79477-456 (1977). The same results are observed when<br>
peroxidase is assayed using luminol-hydrogen peroxidase as a<br>
substrate in the presence of N-methylphenothiazine and<br>
phenolindophenol as an enhancer as shown in Fig. 2 of U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,171,668. Furthermore, this reference shows the non-linear<br>
relationship between the concentration of a peroxidase-labeled AFP<br>
antibody and light emission.<br>
In spite of its known deficiencies horseradish peroxidase, as<br>
noted above, is still widely used for assays because it is widely<br>
available and inexpensive to use. Horseradish peroxidase catalyzes<br>
the luminescent oxidation of a wide range of substrates including<br>
cyclic hydrazide, phenol derivatives, acridane derivatives and<br>
components of bioluminescent systems. Other suitable substrates,<br>
also, include: (a) luminol and related compounds, as taught by [ I.<br>
Ewetz, and A. Thore. Anal. Biochem.. 71, 564 (1976), A.D. Pronovost<br>
and A. Baumgarten, Experientia. 38, 304 (1982), H. Arakawa, M.<br>

Schaap, J.Org.Chem.. 63, 930 (1998)]; and (d) luciferins isolated<br>
from Pholas dactlus. and the firefly Photinus pvralis or Cypridina as<br>
disclosed by [K.Puget, A.M. Michelson and S. Avrameas, Anal.<br>
Biochem.. 79, 447 (1977), D. Slawikska, J. Siwinski, W. Pukacki and<br>
K. Polewski, in "Analytical Application of Bioluminescence and<br>
Chemiluminescence" (E. Schram and P. Stanley, eds.), p. 239, State<br>
Publishing and Printing. Westlake Village, California, 1979. T.<br>
Kobayashi, K. Saga, S. Shimizu and T. Goto, Aaric.Biol.Chem.. 46,<br>
1403 (1981)]. These light producing reactions differ widely in their<br>
detection limits, specificity, reagent availability and magnitude and<br>
kinetics of light emission. This, of course, restricts their applicability.<br>
As noted above, peroxidase catalyzed luminescence suffers from<br>
two problems, namely, (1) peroxidase enzyme instability at lower<br>
concentrations in a buffer, and (2) low luminescence efficiency and<br>
high background. The known literature reveals that most of the time,<br>
the second problem, can be compensated for. For example, the prior<br>
art teaches the use of a non-chemiluminescent hydrogen donor, such<br>
as o-phenylenediamine, to activate the luminescent reaction of<br>
pyrogallol. See, inter alia, Ahnstrom and Nilsson Acta.Chim.Scand-<br>
19, 313 (1966).<br>
However, the effect of a non-chemiluminescent donor on<br>
luminescence has been found to be profoundly influenced by<br>
changes in the ratio between the luminescent donor and the non-<br>
luminescent donor. The increase of light emission caused by the<br>
addition of o-phenylenediamine is accompanied by an accelerated<br>
formation of the blue dimer, thus speeding up the rate-limiting step.<br>
At constant pyrogallol concentrations it has been found that the<br>
addition of o-phenylenediamine never causes an increase in the<br>
integrated luminescence yield, although the velocity of the<br>
luminescent process can be accelerated, thus giving a higher<br>
luminescence peak. On the other hand incorporation of p-<br>
phenylenediamine into a peroxidase-purpurogallin-hydrogen<br>
peroxide system results in an eight-fold enhancement of light<br>
emission [M. Halmann, B.Velan, T. Sery and H. Schupper,<br>
Photochem. Photobiochem.. 30, 165 (1979)]. The effect of other<br>
factors such as pH change, deuterated solvent, radical scavengers<br>
and the addition of other enhancers on the enhancement of<br>
chemiluminescence of peroxidase-catalyzed reactions has been<br>
reported in the literature. See, inter alia, LEwetz and A. Thore, Anal.<br>

Patent No. 116454 (1983) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,598,044.<br>
Similarly, numerous assay enhancers have been employed in<br>
conjunction with and in a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction of luminol or<br>
acridanes to increase the intensity and duration of light emission.<br>
These enhancers include benzothiazole derivatives such as 6-<br>
hydroxybenzothiazole derivatives, dehydroluciferin, firefly luciferin,<br>
substituted phenols such as p-iodiophenols, p-phenylphenol or 2-<br>
naphthol, and aromatic amines such as p-phenylenediamine or<br>
tetramethyl benzidine. Other compounds which function as<br>
enhancers for chemiluminescent oxidation of amino-substituted cyclic<br>
acylhydrazide by a peroxidase include N,N-dimethylindoaniline, 2,6-<br>
dichlorophenoline-o-cresol, phenolindophenol, N-methyl-<br>
phenathiazine and a combination of phenolindolphenol and N-<br>
methylphenathiazine as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,668 and<br>
Paul D. Davis, Kelli Feather-Henigan, Kimberiy Hines,<br>
PCT/US97/06422 (1999).<br>
The chemiluminescence enhancing effect of 2-hydroxy-9-fluoro-4-<br>
hydroxy~3-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1 -oxo-2-propenyl]-2H-1 -<br>
benzopyrene-2-one and substituted oxazole derivatives in a<br>
peroxidase-oxidant-luminol or isoluminol system has, also, been<br>
reported. See, U. S. Pat. No. 5,206,149. Similarly, surfactants<br>
including nonionic, cationic and anionic as well as polymeric<br>
compounds are known to affect the light producing efficiency of<br>
peroxidase catalyzed reactions, as reported by L J. Kricka and M.<br>
Deluca, Arch. Biochem. Biophvs.. 217. 674 (1983); T. Goto and H.<br>
Fukatsu, Tet. Letts., 4299 (1969); and K. Sasamoto and Y. Ohkura,<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull.. 39. 411 1991). The major advantage of<br>
enhanced assays is that the intensity of light emission may be<br>
greater than 1000-fold that of the un-enhanced reaction. Also,<br>
conditions can be employed under which light emission is prolonged<br>
and decay is slow.<br>
The full mechanism for the oxidation of cyclic acylhydrazides and<br>
acridanes by the combination of peroxide and peroxidase enzyme<br>
and the light enhancement by enhancers is not known. However,<br>
many compounds reported to increase light emission from<br>
chemiluminescent and bioluminescent systems do not enhance the<br>
peroxidase-catalyzed system under reported conditions, but 6-<br>
hydroxybenzothiazole and phenol derivatives produce dramatic<br>
increases in light intensity, thereby suggesting they operate by a<br>
different mechanism. See, for example, (T. P. Whitehead, G. H. G.<br>

oxidizing agents include hydrogen peroxide, urea hydrogen peroxide,<br>
sodium carbonate hydrogen peroxide or a perborate salt. Other<br>
oxidants or oxidizing agents known to those skilled in the art may be<br>
used herein. The preferred oxidant is either hydrogen peroxide or urea<br>
hydrogen peroxide and mixtures thereof. As noted systems which<br>
produce peroxide in situ can be used such as a D-glucose and glucose<br>
oxidase system as well as a cholesterol-cholesterol oxidase system and<br>
the like.<br>
The stabilizing agent prevents the peroxide compound from<br>
reacting prior to addition of the enzyme or the other molecule to the<br>
composition. The stabilizer or stabilizing agent may be selected from any<br>
of the well known stabilizers including, for example, cyclodextrin, dextrin<br>
sulfate, sugars such as glucose, sucrose and others, nonionic<br>
surfactants, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, as well as those well<br>

pyrophosphates, cytidine nucleotides, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, ethylene-<br>
bis(oxyethyienenitriio) tetraacetic acid, and other related<br>
macromolecules as well as any other compounds capable of stabilizing<br>
the chemiluminescent compound in the formulation and which are<br>
known to the skilled artisan.<br>
The substrate hereof, preferably, has a pH of about pH 5.5 to<br>
about pH12.0. Thus, a buffer is used to bring the substrate within the<br>
useful pH range.<br>
Suitable buffers include for example citrates, acetates, tris,<br>
borates, carbonates and phosphates, aminopropanols and the like, as<br>
well as mixtures thereof. Suitable acids or bases, as needed, can be<br>
used to adjust the pH of the buffer or buffers to bring the final pH of the<br>
system to pH 5.5 to pH 12.0.<br>
As noted above, the present substrate may, also, include a<br>
chemiluminescence enhancer. Generally, the enhancer used herein<br>
comprises an organic compound which is soluble in an organic solvent<br>
or in a buffer and which enhances the luminescent reaction between the<br>
chemiluminescent organic compound, the oxidant and the enzyme or<br>
other biological molecule. Suitable enhancers include, for example,<br>
halogenated phenols, such as p-iodophenol, p-bromophenol, p-<br>
chlorophenol, 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol, 3,4-dichlorophenol, alkylated<br>
phenols, such as 4-methylphenol and, 4-tert-butylphenol, 3-(4-<br>

as p-phenylphenoi phosphate or p-iodophenol phosphate or other<br>
phenolic phosphates having other enzyme cleavable groups, as well as<br>
p-phenylene diamine and tetramethyl benzidine. Other useful<br>
enhancers include fluorescein.such as 5-(n-tetradecanyl) amino<br>
fluorescein and the like. Of course mixtures of enhancers may be used.<br>
Herein, the preferred enhancer is p-phenylphenol.<br>
The solubilizing agent increases the solubility of both the<br>
enhancer, when used, and the organic chemiluminescent compound in<br>
the aqueous buffer solution. When the organic chemiluminescent<br>
compound and enhancer are not water soluble any suitable organic<br>
solvent such as dimethyl sulfbxide, dimethyl formamide, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran and alcohols may be used with the stabilizers as a<br>
solubilizer.<br>
In preparing the present composition, the components are used in<br>
the following amounts:<br>

Example I, a solution B containing luminol and a solution C containing p-<br>
phenylphenol were prepared. Then. 0.6 ml of solution B and 1.0 ml of<br>
solution C was added dropwise with stirring to 100 ml of solution A.<br>
Next, 40 mg of lauryl sulfate was added and stirred for 5-10 minutes.<br>

added to the test tube and the luminescence was recorded at 60<br>
seconds interval to the maximum intensity. In this example background<br>
was 15.1 and signal intensity was 564336. The signal to background<br>
ratio was calculated to be 37373. The glucose oxidase solution was<br>
obtained by diluting 100 mg of the glucose oxidase enzyme in 3 ml of<br>
phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and, then further diluted by taking 100 ml of<br>
the solution and adding it to 1.9 ml of the phosphate buffer.<br>
This procedure was repeated using varying concentrations of<br>
HRP enzyme and was plotted against measured intensity. This is<br>
shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, with Fig. 2B showing the results at lower<br>
concentrations of peroxidase enzyme. Fig. 3 shows linearty of the<br>
results over a small range HRP enzyme concentrations, while Fig. 4A<br>

shows linearty of the results over a small range peroxidase enzyme<br>
concentrations at maximum intensity of light out put.<br>
Example XIV<br>
Using the same solution A as in Example I, a chemiluminescent<br>
formulation was prepared using a solution B of luminol and a solution C<br>
of p-phenylphenol. In preparing the composition 0.6 ml of solution B and<br>
1.0 ml of solution C were added dropwise with stirring to 100 ml of<br>
solution A. Then 40 mg of lauryl sulfate, 400 ml of HRP (10K) and 1.0 ml<br>
of glucose oxidase were added thereto and stirred for about 5 to 10<br>
minutes.<br>
The glucose oxidase was obtained by dissolving 100 mg thereof<br>
in 3 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. A 200 ml sample was transferred<br>
to a test tube and the background was recorded. Thereafter 10 ml of D-<br>
glucose (50 mg in 100 mi of Dl water) was added to the test tube<br>
causing hydrogen peroxide to be generated in-situ. The luminescence<br>
was recorded at 10 second of interval to the maximum intensity, in this<br>
experiment the background was 1.0 and the signal intensity was 3059.<br>
The procedure was repeated using various concentrations of<br>
glucose and was plotted against intensity. The results are shown in Fig.<br>

invention provides a stabilized chemiluminescent formulation which<br>
enables light detection in the presence of peroxide which may be part of<br>
the formulation or which can be generated in-situ. It is to be appreciated<br>
that by using the horseradish peroxidase, alone, or in conjunction with<br>
oxidase enzyme such as glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase and the<br>
like, the presence of glucose, cholesterol, etc., can readily detected in<br>
body fluids such as, blood, serum, saliva, urine and so forth. Similarly,<br>
the composition hereof provides a single stable reagent for detecting<br>
and quantifying various biological molecules, including haptens, antigens<br>
and antibodies by immunoassy; proteins by Western blotting; DNA and<br>
RNA by Southern and Northern blotting respectively, and for detecting<br>
DNA and for DNA sequencing.<br>
As a detection formulation, the composition hereof defines a<br>
substrate. Thus in use, a quantity of known biological molecule such as<br>
polyclonal or monoclonal antibody, antigen, hapten-protein, protein,<br>
DNA, RNA or the like is deposited or coated onto a support. The support<br>
or base is a solid surface which may be of any suitable material such as<br>
glass or plastic. The material may be in the form of a microtiter plate or a<br>
tube, a bead, a membrane or the like. After the coating is applied, the<br>
sample to be tested is then, exposed to the coating, followed thereafter<br>
by further sequencing. This can be illustrated as follows:<br>
Where S is the support, Ab is an antibody, Ag is an antigen, Sec. Ab is a<br>
secondary antibody, E is an enzyme and the substrate is the present<br>
formulation. In the illustration, S-Ab-Ag-Sec.Ab-E defines a probe.<br>
Other useful probes include those which correspond to the following:<br>
S-Ag-Ab-SecAb-E;<br>
S-protein-hapten-Ab-E;<br>
S-protein-Ab-E;<br>
S-DNA-biotin-avidin-E; and<br>
S-RNA-biotin-avidin-E.<br>
It is to be appreciated that and in accordance herewith, and as<br>
noted above, the enzyme E can be horseradish peroxdase in<br>
combination or admixture with glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase or<br>
the like, or may be an other trigger such as cytochrome C, protohemin,<br>
hemoglobin and the like.<br>
Thus, the present invention may be used for, inter alia, labeling<br>
haptens, antibodies, proteins, avidin, streptavidin and DNA and RNA for<br>
enzyme immunoassays, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting and<br>
DNA detection. Also, the present substrate can be used for detecting<br>
cholesterol, or glucose in blood, serum, urine and saliva.<br>
In a commercial embodiment, hereof, the present substrate may<br>
be packaged as a kit including a support, as well as, optionally, with an<br>
antibody, antigen, secondary antibody, etc. in a separate containers.<br>
Having, thus, described the invention what is claimed is:<br>
There is disclosed a method for making a storage stable formulation for use in<br>
chemiluminescent assay and detection procedures which comprises:<br>
(a) mixing together a plurality of compounds consisting essentially of:<br>
(1) from 0.1 mM to 200 mM, of at least one chemiluminescent organic<br>
compound,<br>
(2) from 0.5 mM to 250 mM, of at least one oxidizing agent,<br>
(3) from 0.01% to 40%, by volume, based on the total volume, of at least<br>
one stabilizing agent, and<br>
(4) from 0.1 mM to 10 mM, of at least one buffer, to form a one-part<br>
formulation, the formulation having a pH of from pH 5.5 to pH 12.0;<br>
(b) placing and storing the one-part formulation in an amber bottle, and<br>
wherein is storage stable for an extended period of time.</td>
