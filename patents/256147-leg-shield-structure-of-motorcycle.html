[0008]<br>
For its action, as the clearance extended in a long range from the front side of the cylinder body of the engine to the rear side of the cylinder body is provided between the upper leg shield and the lower leg shield, the clearance can be substantially horizontally formed and after running wind flowing substantially horizonrally enters inside each right and left leg shield, the running wind can easily flow out of the body through the clearance. At this time, hot air in the cylinder body is also easily radiated out of the body via the clearance together with a flow of the running wind.   In addition, as the clearance is formed to be long in a longitudinal direction and a direction of the clearance coincides with a direction of a flow of running wind, airy appearance as the motorcycle is acquired. [0005]<br>
characteristic that clearance is formed to be narrow in the<br><br>
intake system in a side view.<br>
For its action, running wind is ventilated via one clearance by narrowing the clearance in the front of a leg shield, a rider's leg is easily shielded from the front side, running wind is much ventilated via the clearance by widening the clearance in the intermediate part of one leg shield, and a part inside the leg shield is easily maintained by inserting a tool for example inside the leg shield via the clearance. [0010]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 has a characteristic that a rib protruded in a direction of vehicle width is formed at an upper edge of a lower leg shield.<br>
For its action, the rigidity of the lower leg shield is increased by the rib protruded in the direction of vehicle width provided to the upper edge of the lower leg shield.  A flow of running wind inside the leg shield is changed by the rib and the running wind is guided to an engine. [0011]<br>
The invention according ro Claim 4 has a characterisric that a mesh rib is formed at an upper edge of the rear of a lower leg shield to close clearance.<br>
rib and a splash scattered inside the leg shield from a road surface and a front wheel is substantially prevented<br><br>
[0012]<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 has a characteristic that a center cover is provided from one substantial center of a main frame to the downside of a seat and a concave portion is formed on an extended line of clearance in the center cover.<br>
For its action, running wind flowing out of a body from the inside of a leg shield via the clearance easily flows toward the rear of the body through the concave portion. [0013]<br>
The invention according to Claim 6 has a characteristic that a cover is formed at an upper edge of the rear of a lower leg shield to close clearance.<br>
For its action, a splash scattered inside a leg shield from a road surface and a front wheel is substantially prevented from hitting a rider's leg by the cover.<br>
[Effect of the Invention] [0014]<br>
According to the invention disclosed in Claim 1, as the leg shield is divided into the upper leg shield and the lower leg shield vertically in two and the clearence between one upper leg shield and the lower leg shield is<br>
engine to the rear side of the cylinder body, heat<br><br>
