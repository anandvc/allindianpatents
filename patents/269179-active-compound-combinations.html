				<td>Active compound combinations<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising, firstly, known carboxamides and, secondly, insecticidally active compounds, which active compound combinations are highly suitable for controlling unwanted animal pests, such as insects or acarids, and also unwanted phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is already known that certain carboxamides have fungicidal properties: for example   N-[2-(l,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl)phenyl]-5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyI-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide   from   WO 03/010149   und<br>
3-(trifluoromethyl)-N-[2-( 1,3-dimethylbutyl)phenyl]-5-fluoro-1 -methyl- lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide<br>
from DE-A 103 03 589. The activity of these compounds is good; however, at low application rates it is-<br>
sometimes unsatisfactory.	<br>
Furthermore,  it is known that numerous phosphoric esters, carbamates, heterocycles, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf, for example,' US 2,758,115, US 3,309,266, GB 1,181,657, WO 93/22297 A1, WO 93/10083 Al, DE2641 343 Al, EP 347 488 Al, EP 210 487 Al, US 3,264,l77 arid EP 234 045 A2). However, the activity of these compounds is likewise not always satisfactory.<br>

The fact that the active compound combinations are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits a treatment of entire plants (above-ground parts of plants and roots), of propagation stock and seed, and of the soil. The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used for foliar application or else as seed dressings.<br>
The fact that the active compounds which can be' used are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits a treatment of the seed. Accordingly, the active compounds according to the invention can be used as seed dressings.<br>
A large part of the damage to crop plants which is caused by phytopathogenic fungi occurs as early as when the seed is attacked during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, as well as during and immediately after germination of the plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots arid shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable compositions is therefore of particularly great'interest.<br>
The control of phytopathogenic fungi which damage plants post-emergence is carried out primarily by treating the soil and the above-ground parts of plants with crop protection agents. Owing to the concerns regarding a possible impact of crop protection agents on the environment and the health of man and animals, there are efforts to reduce the amount of active compounds applied.<br>
The control of phytopathogenic fungi by treating the seeds of plants has been known for a long time and is subject-matter of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed frequently entails a series<br>
of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop<br>
methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional application<br>
of crop protection agents after sowing or after the emergence of the plants or where additional<br><br>
application is at least reduced. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide maximum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic fungicidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection agents being employed.<br>
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, by treating the seed with a composition according to the invention.<br>
The invention likewise relates to the use of the composition according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the germinating plant from phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with a composition according to the invention so as to afford protection fromphytopathogenic fungi.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that, by virtue of the particular systemic properties of the compositions according to the invention, treatment of the se£d with these compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants'after emergence, from phytopathogenic fungi, In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
Furthermore, it must be considered as advantageous that the mixtures according to the invention can also be employed in particular in transgenic seed.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflowers, beans, coffee,' beet'(for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanuts, vegetables (such as tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and lettuce), lawn and ornamental plants. The treatment of seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye and oats), maize and rice is of particular importance.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the composition according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state which is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between<br>
harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. Thus, for example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried to a moisture content of below 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, has, for example; been-treated with water and then dried again.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that, the amount of the composition according to' the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
The compositions according,to the invention can be applied directly, that is to say without comprising further components and without having been diluted. In general, it is preferable to apply the composition to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and methods for the treatment of seed are known to the skilled Worker and are described, for example, in the following documents: US 4,272,417 A, US 4,245,432 A, US 4,808,430 A, US 5,876,739 A, US 2003/0176428 Al, WO 2002/080675 Al, WO 2002/028186 A2.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention also have a potent strengthening effect in plants. They are therefore suitable for mobilizing'the plants' defences against attack by undesired microorganisms.<br>
Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing)'substances are understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants in such a way that, when subsequently inoculated with undesired microorganisms, the treated plants display a substantial degree of resistance to these microorganisms.<br>
In the present case, undesired microorganisms are' underst6od as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for protecting plants against attack by the abovementioned pathogens within a certain period of time after the treatment.' The period of time within which their protection is effected is generally extended from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the plants have been treated with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compound combinations, at the concentrations required for the controlling of plant diseases, are well tolerated by plants permits the treatment of aerial plant parts, of vegetative propagation material and seed, and of the soil.<br>
In this context, the active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed particularly successfully for controlling cereal diseases such as, for example, against Puccinia species and diseases in viticulture, fruit production and vegetable production such as, for example against Botrytis, Venturia or Alternaria species.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
If appropriate, the active compound combinations according to the invention can also be used in certain concentrations and application rates as herbicides, for influencing plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or .by biptechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-grbund and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which rriay be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compound combinations is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multilayer coating.<br>
In the protection of materials, the active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against attack and destruction by undesired microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, industrial materials are understood as meaning non-live materials which have<br>
been made for use in technology. For example, industrial materials which are to be protected by active compounds according to the invention from microbial modification or destruction can be glues, sizes, paper and board, textiles, leather, timber, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which are capable of being .attacked or destroyed by microorganisms. Parts of production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which can be adversely affected by the multiplication of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned with preference for the purposes of the present invention are glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, timber, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer fluids, especially preferably wood.<br>
Microorganisms which are capable of bringing about a degradation or modification of the industrial materials and which may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active compounds according to the invention are preferably active against fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes) and against slime organisms and algae.<br>
Examples which may be mentioned are microorganism's of the following genera:<br>
Alternaria such as Alternaria teniiis,<br>
Aspergillus such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
Coniophora such as Coniophora puetana,'<br>

Trichoderma such as Trichoderma viride,<br>
Escherichia such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>

In addition, the active compound combinations according to the invention also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic spectrum of action, in particular against dermatophytes and budding fungi, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The enumeration of<br>
these fungi is no restriction whatsoever of the mycotic spectrum which can be controlled and is provided by illustration only.<br>
The active compound combinations can be employed as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are applied in the customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, painting on and the like. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. The seed of the plant can also be treated.<br>
When employing the active compound combinations according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a substantial range, depending on the type of application. In the treatment of plant parts, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For the treatment of seed, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.0-1 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For treating the soil, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
According to the invention, the :plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously with the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges indicated above for the active compounds and mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with compounds or mixtures specifically indicated in the present text.<br>

particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of composition or concentrate employed depends on the species and the abundance of the insects and on the medium. The optimal quantity to be employed can be determined in each case by test series upon application. In general, however, it will suffice to .employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organpchemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C,<br>

The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture or an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced. Aliphatic organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like.<br><br>

Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or plasticiizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent'volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 6.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters such as di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br>

Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes^ cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and parts of plants with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material,' in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multilayer coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, arid parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof, are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in<br><br>
use are treated according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the; substances and compositions which can be. used according to the invention, better plant growth, more developed root system, better resistance of the plant species or plant cultivar, increased shoot growth, increased plant vitality, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, larger fruit, larger plants, greener leaves, earlier flowers, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher concentration of sugar in the fruit, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to' the' invention include all plants which,' in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful 'properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth; increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/6r a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insert's, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b); CrylA(c), CryllA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, 'sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes'which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which<br>
may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), Dvfl® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned also include the varieties sold under the name Glearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars which have these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, and which will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
According to the invention, the plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously with the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The abovementioned preferred ranges for the mixtures also apply for the treatment of these plants. The treatment of plants with the mixtures especially listed in the present text are particularly emphasized.<br>
The good action of the insecticidal. acaricidal and fungicidal active compound combinations according to the invention is demonstrated by the examples below. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their fungicidal action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides, acaricides and fungicides is always present when the insecticidal or fungicidal action of the active compound Combinations exceeds the total of the action of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected insecticidal. acaricidal and fungicidal action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, accbfding to S.R. Colby ("Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 1967,15,20-22):<br>
If<br>
X	is the kill rate expressed in % of the untreated'control when employing active compound A at an<br>
application rate of rh g/h'a or at a concentration of m ppm, <br>
Y         is the kill rate expressed in % of the untreated control when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha or at a concentration of n ppm and<br>
E	is the kill rate expressed in % of the untreated control when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and h 'g/ha or at a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
then  (Formula Removed)  <br>
If the actual insecticidal. acaricidal and fungicidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the kill rate of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the actually observed kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected kill rate (E).<br>
Examples<br>
Example A<br>
Myzus persicae -Test<br>
Solvent:	7    parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier:	2     parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed<br>
with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-<br>
containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Cabbage leaves (Brassica oleracea) which are heavily infested by the green peach aphid (Myzus<br>
persicae) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired<br>
concentration.	,<br>
