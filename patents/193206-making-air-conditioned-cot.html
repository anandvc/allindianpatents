				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An air- conditioned cot comprising a cot and a flexible hood over the oot. The hood provides an enclosed space over the cot. This enclosed space is air conditioned so that a very low capacity air-conditioner is sufficient. The hood will be of thermally insulating flexible material and can be rolled up and down on a support structure on the cot. A safety door that opens automatically when the air-oonditioner stops is provided on the support structure. This is accomplished by using expandable bladders or bellows that expands by the air pressure from the air-oonditioner to close the door. Some areas on the hood and structure are made transparent to have visibility. A tailor made low capacity air-conditioner is connected to the cot using flexible hoses.</td>

				<td>This ivention relates to making air-conditioned cot The purpose of this invention is to provide air-cooditioning at a lower cost the power cost or air-condittoning is the recurriag cost which  makes it unaffrdable to people. The power consumption will be tremeodously hrought down by the use of air-conditioned cot and hereby make it affordable to so many people, lids will have particular utility for patients who require air-cooditioning but cannot afford room air-conditioners. Moreover air-conditioned cot can easily substitute room air conditioners when people are sleeping and thus can function as an energy saving appliance. the method of making the cot is described herein. The cot will be provided with a supporting Glmcture on it A flexible hood will be fixed on the structure in such a manner fbat it can freely roll 17 and down. When it is rolled up an enclosed space will be formed over the cot By connecting a low capacity air-conditioner to this enclosed space through flexible hoses the cot will be made air-conditioned The hood will be of themally insusting material to minimise the heat ingress. There will be a safety door that opens automatically when the air-conditioner stops in order to let in sufficient air for the persons sleeping inside. This is accomplished as follows. The construction of the hood and supporting structure are such that when the hood is rolled 19 it does not cover an opening on one side of the structure. An expandable bladder of  bellows will be fitted in this opening. The air from the blower in the air-conditioner will be connected to this bellow through a flexible hose. When the blower starts running the bladder will get inflated due to the air pressure and it will move up and close the opening. When the blower stops the bladder will deflate and remain at the bottom thereby opening the door. For symmetry, the similar space on the opposite side wilt be closed with transparent material The bottom plank of the cot will be thermally insulated at the bottom side. The construction of the cot is described in detail with reference to the attached drawing.<br><br>
In figure 1, the supporting structure 2, is fixed on the cot 1. The safety door 3,is on one side of the structure. The corresponding space on the opposite side is closed by transparent sheet 5 for symmetiy. In figure 2 and figure 3 the air conditioner is not moning. The expandable bladder 4, remains at the bottom and the safety door 3, remains opoa la figure 2 the air conditioner is running and the bladder moves up due to air pressure and closes the safety door. The flexible hood 5, is in the rolled the position in figure 2 and figure 3. In figure 1, the hood is in rolled down position. When it is rolled down the hood rests in a side ti^ 7, provided on the sides of the cot the suction of the air-conditioner 8, is connected to the cot directly and the discharge through the bladder by flexible hoses 9.<br>
The hood is made of flexible insulating materials to prevent heat ingress. the bottom area 10, of the hood is made transparent to have visibility. the modality of operation is as follows. Initially the cot will be as shown in figure 1. The hood will be in rolled down condition and air conditioner will be off When the cot is to be used the hood will be first rolled up as in figure 2. llien the air-conditioner will be switched oa When the air from the air-conditioner passes through the bladder, it will expand and move up thereby closing the safety door as shown in figure 3. In case the blower in the air-conditioner gets stopped by any chance, the bladder will deflate and move down thereby opening the safety door and go back to the position shown in figure 2.<br>
A sample calculation of the air-conditioning load required for a double cot and a single cot are given on the next sheet It can be seen that load required is only 0.24 and 0.12 tonnes respectively for double and single cots.<br><br><br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the construction disclosed here but also conq[M4se ai^ modification to the assembly or the safety door arrangment, which fells under the scope of this discloBure.<br><br><br>
I daim<br>
l.An air-conditioned cot comprising a cot with thermally insulated<br>
bottom plank, a flexible and thermally insulating hood over  the oot that<br>
can be rolled up and down on support structure on the cot, support<br>
structure for the hood, a low capacity air-conditioner fitted to the cot<br>
through flexible hoses, a safety door which opens automatically when<br>
the air-conditioner stops.<br>
2.Air-conditioned oot as claimed in 1 in which the said hood is made<br>
transparent at the bottom area to ensure visibility and which on rolling<br>
up provides an enclosed space over the cot<br>
3.Air-conditioned cot as claimed in 1 where the said support structure<br>
and hood is so constructed as to have an opening on one side when the<br>
hood is railed 153<br>
4.Air-conditioned cot as daimed in 1 where the safety door camprises<br>
the said opening in daim 3 and a bladder, which expands on air<br>
pressure and contracts when pressure is rdeased, fitted in the said<br>
opening in claim 3<br><br>
5.Air-connditined cot as claimed in 4 were, the said bladder is<br>
connected to a low capacity air-conditioner such that the bladder<br>
expands and doses the door when the air-conditioner is switched on<br>
and opens the door when the ear conditioner stops<br>
6 Air-conditioned oot as claimed in 1 where the said air-conditioner is<br>
tailor made to suit the low capacity<br>
7.An  air-conditioned  oot  substantially  as  herein described with<br>
reference to and illustrated in the attached drawing.<br><br></td>
