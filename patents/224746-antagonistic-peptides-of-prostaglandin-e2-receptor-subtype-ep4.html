				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Antagonistic peptides of prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype<br>
EP4<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to antagonistic peptides of<br>
prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP4. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to peptidic antagonists of prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype<br>
EP4 and their use in the treatment of medical conditions associated with<br>
oligouric nephropathy, bone resorption, abnormal intestinal crypt cell<br>
proliferation or patency of ductus arteriosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Prostaglandins are derived from the oxygenation of<br>
arachidonic acid by prostaglandin (PG) synthases. Prostaglandins mediate a<br>
wide variety of physiological actions, such as vasomotricity, sleepAwaJsejsyde,<br>
intestinal secretion, lipolysis, glomerular filtration, mast cell degranulation,<br>
neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, teuteolysis, myometrial contraction<br>
and labor, inflammation and arthritis, patent ductus arteriosus, cell growth and<br>
differentiation. Prostanoids mediate their actions through binding to distinct<br>
receptors which belong to the super family of rhodopsin-like seven<br>
transmembrane helical receptors. These receptors are coupled to<br>
heterotrimeric G-proteins comprised of a, ÃŸ and ? subunits which, upon<br>
activation, elicit alterations in cell calcium, initiate phosphoinositide hydrolysis,<br>
or promotion or repression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis<br>
(Narumiya, S. et al. 1999; Physiol. Rev. 79:1193-1226.).<br>
[0004] Of the five pharmacologically-distinct prostanoid receptors<br>
PGE2, PGI2, PGD2, PGF2a, and TxA2, four subtypes of PGE2 receptor are<br>
described (Ichikawa, et al. 1996). These are EP1, EP2, EP3, which have<br>
several splice variants, and EP4. Cloned human EP4 (also known as<br>
prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP4) is a 488 amino acid glycoprotein,<br>
linked to Ga, and is involved in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase and<br>
cAMP synthesis (US patents No. 5, 759, 789 and 5,605,814). The EP4<br>
receptor is expressed at high levels in the intestine, but at much lower levels<br>
in the lung, kidney, thymus, uterus and brain (Bastien, Y. et al. 1994; J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 269 (16): 11873-77). The EP4 receptor is involved in fluid filtration in<br>
the kidney, differentiation of monocyte / macrophage precursors into<br>
osteoclasts, proliferation of intestinal crypt cells, and patency of ductus<br>
arteriosus in the mammalian fetus.<br>
[0005] PGE2 is abundantly produced in the kidneys and is involved<br>
in the regulation of renal microcirculation, salt and water transport, and renin<br>
release (Breyer, M. D. et al. 1998; Kidney Int. 54 (Suppl. 67): S88-94). All EP<br>
receptors are regionally distributed in the kidney structures (Morath, R. et al.<br>
1999; J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 10: 1851-60) and are associated with specific<br>
functions. All studies conducted on the distribution of EP receptors in the<br>
kidneys have shown that the EP4 receptor is uniquely expressed in glomeruli<br>
(Breyer, M. D. et al. 1996; Am. J. Physiol. 270: F912-918. Morath, R. et al.<br>
1999; J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 10: 1851-60). However, the presence of this<br>
receptor in other structures of the nephron, such as the collecting duct<br>
(Breyer, M. D. et al. 1998; Kidney Int. 54 (Suppl. 67): S88-94), the media of<br>
renal arteries and vasa recta (Morath, R. et al. 1999; J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 10:<br>
1851-60) has been separately reported. EP4 transcripts have also been found<br>
in juxtaglomerular granule cells, and is consistent with PGE2-induced cAMP<br>
synthesis in these cells. EP4 may therefore also play a role in renin secretion.<br>
[0006] Glomerular prostaglandins are thought to affect filtration<br>
(Schlondoff, D. et al. 1987; Kidney Int. 29:108-19) and renin release. PGE2<br>
increases cAMP levels in isolated glomeruli (Freidlander, G. et al., 1983; Mol.<br>
Cell. Endocrinol. 30: 201-214). It was suggested that the EP4 receptor<br>
coupled to cAMP synthesis, may regulate glomerular filtration (Sugimoto, Y.<br>
et al. 1994; Am. J. Physiol. 266(5 Pt 2):F823-8). Using small molecule<br>
antagonists (Kohno, Y. et al. WO 00/16760) and peptide antagonists (Peri,<br>
K.G. ef al. WO 00/01445), a direct role of the EP4 receptor in modulating<br>
kidney filtration and urine output has been demonstrated.<br>
[0007] Bones undergo continuous remodelling, wherein bone<br>
formation is carried out by osteoblasts and bone resorption is carried out by<br>
osteoclasts. These processes are controlled by several humoral factors such<br>
as parathyroid hormone, estradiol, vitamin D, cytokines, growth factors and<br>
prostaglandins. It has been illustrated that osteoclast induction by interleukin-<br>
1 (IL-1) is inhibited by aspirin-like drugs (Tai, H. et al. 1997). PGE2 analogues<br>
with EP4 receptor agonistic activity (no specific agonists or antagonists to this<br>
receptor exist to date) promote osteoclast formation in co-cultures of mouse<br>
osteoblasts and bone marrow cells. Similar experiments using cells from EP4-<br>
knockout mice resulted in reduced osteoclast formation, suggesting a role of<br>
the EP4 receptor in osteoclastogenesis in mice (Narumiya et al. 1999).<br>
[0008] The ductus arteriosus is a normal large, low resistance,<br>
shunt vessel in fetuses, facilitating the bypass of blood towards the lungs.<br>
Since the fetus does not use its lungs (oxygen is provided through the<br>
mother's placenta), fetal lungs are collapsed and pose a high resistance to<br>
blood flow. Hence, blood flows from the right ventricle through the ductus into<br>
the descending aorta. High levels of circulating prostaglandins, particularly<br>
PGE2, keep the ductus in the foots open. When the infant is bom, the lungs<br>
are inflated, the pulmonary resistance drops, PGE2 levels decrease, the<br>
ductus begins to close, and blood from the pulmonary artery thus enters into<br>
the lungs. The high levels of oxygen in the new born often close the ductus,<br>
in most cases within 24 hours. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is the<br>
condition wherein the ductus doesn't close. In cases of PDA, morbidity and<br>
mortality rates are directly related to the flow volume through the ductus<br>
arteriosus. A large PDA may cause pulmonary hypertension, edema,<br>
recurrent infections, and may lead to congestive heart failure, if left untreated<br>
over long periods. Development of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease<br>
may occur. It is estimated that if left untreated, the mortality rate is 20% by the<br>
age of 20, 42% by the age of 45, and 60% by the age of 60. Females are 2<br>
to 3 times more likely than males to develop PDA.<br>
[0009] PDA can be treated either by drugs such as Indomethacin,<br>
which is a prostaglandin synthesis blocker, or by corrective surgery.<br>
Indomethacin, however, has side effects on renal ischemia and renal<br>
hypofusion, resulting in ischemic renal failure in preterm infants. EP4 is<br>
expressed in fetal pig (Bhattacharya, M. et al. 1999; Circulation 100(16): 1751-<br>
6), fetal lamb (Bouayad, A. et al., 2001; Am. J. Physiol. Heart Cir.cPhysiol.<br>
280(5); H2342-9) and fetal baboon (Smith G. C. et al., 2001; J. Candiovasc.<br>
Pharmacol. 37(6): 697-704) ductus arteriosus. Paradoxically, EP4 knock-out<br>
mice die after birth due to insufficient closure of ductus arteriosus (Nguyen,<br>
M. et al. 1997; Nature, 390: 78-81).<br>
[0010] A selective peptidic antagonist of the EP4 receptor has<br>
been used in the treatment of fetal ductus arteriosus (Peri, K. G. et a/., WO<br>
00/01445 and Wright, D.H. et al. Am. J Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol.<br>
2001; 281 (5):R1343-60).<br>
[0011] Prostaglandins, particularly PGE2, play an important role in<br>
intestinal crypt cell proliferation. In fact, the inducible prostaglandin<br>
synthesizing enzyme COX-2 was shown to be present in intestinal polyps, as<br>
well as in colon tumors (Shattuck-Brandt, R.L. et at., 1999; Mol. Carcinog.<br>
24(3): 177-87). COX-2 selective blockers such as Nimesulide were used to<br>
prevent chemical induction of colon carcinogenesis (Jacoby, R. F. et al. 2000;<br>
Cancer Res. 60(18):5040-4). Recently, the actions of PGE2 have been shown<br>
to be mediated by the EP4 receptor, as deduced from the low incidence of<br>
colon polyps in EP4-/- mice, due to azoxymethane and the efficacy of the EP4<br>
selective antagonist ONO-AE2-227 in reducing aberrant crypt foci in<br>
azoxymethane-treated min mice (Mutoh, M. et al. 2002; Cancer Res. 62(1):<br>
28-32).<br>
[0012] There thus remains a need to develop selective peptide<br>
antagonists of the prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP4, and which are<br>
useful in the treatment and prevention of colon carcinogenesis.<br>
[0013] There also remains a need for methods of treating end-<br>
stage renal disease, acute renal failure and other conditions of renal<br>
insufficiency preventing bone resorption in osteoporosis, in addition to<br>
conditions preventing closing of the ductus (PDA) in the neonates<br>
[0014] There also remains a need for methods of treating medical<br>
conditions such as osteoporosis, dental diseases and other diseases where<br>
bone loss is an integral part of the disease process.<br>
[0015] The present invention seeks to meet these and other needs.<br>
[0016] The present description refers to a number of documents,<br>
the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] Selective peptide antagonists of the prostaglandin E2<br>
receptor subtype EP4 are described. These peptidic antagonists can be used<br>
for making pharmaceutical compositions in order to treat patients diagnosed<br>
with acute or progressive renal failure, osteoporosis, dental disease, and<br>
patent ductus arteriosus or patients at risk of developing such diseases.<br>
[0018] The present invention relates to selective peptidic or<br>

[0022] Additionally, the present invention relates to selective EP4<br>
antagonists useful in the treatment of medical conditions such as<br>
osteoporosis, dental diseases and other diseases where bone loss is an<br>

[0023] Further scope and applicability will become apparent from<br>
the detailed description given hereinafter. It should be understood however,<br>
that this detailed description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, is given by way of illustration only, since various changes and<br>
modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0024] Having thus generally described the invention, reference will<br>
now be made to the accompanying drawings, showing by way of illustration<br>
a preferred embodiment thereof, and in which:<br>
[0025] Figure 1A shows the effects of 213.15 and corresponding<br>
derivatives (see Table 3) on the urine flow rate (expressed as ml of urine / h/<br>
kg body weight) in the rat model of ischemic nephropathy. Figures 1B and 1C<br>
show the effects of 213.15 and corresponding derivatives (see Table 3) on the<br>
average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over a period of 60 minutes (from 20<br>
minutes to 80 minutes following injection of the drug, which was immediately<br>
after the removal of the clamps) in the rat model of ischemic nephropathy;<br>
[0026] Figure 2A shows the dose response of 213.29 on the GFR<br>
in normal beagle dogs. Figure 2B shows the maximal effects of 213.29 on<br>
kidney function parameters in rat, dog and piglet;<br>
[0027] Figure 3 shows the effects of 213.29 on the dilation<br>
produced by PGE2 in porcine lower saphenous venous rings that are pre-<br>
contracted with U46619 (thromboxane A2 mimetic);<br>
[0028] Figure 4A shows the degradation profile of 213.29 in human<br>
serum. The peptide contains two lysines at the carboxy terminus which are<br>
susceptible to serum proteases. The degradation results in peptides lacking<br>
either one carboxyl lysine [213.291] or two carboxyl lysines [213.292]. The<br>
carboxyl leucine residue appears to be completely resistant to degradation by<br>
human serum under the experimental conditions. Figure 4B shows the<br>
bioactivity of 213.29 and its metabolites in a cell based assay. Human EP4<br>
expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated with 100 nM PGE2 in the presence<br>
or absence of 213.29 and its metabolites 213.291 and 213.292. cAMP levels<br>
determined by radioimmunoassay were expressed in pmol/105 cells.<br>
[0029] Figure 5 shows the effects of 213.29 on selective agonist-<br>
stimulated contractile responses of other prostanoid receptors (butaprost-<br>
EP2; 17-phenyl PGE2-EP1; PGF2a-FP; U46619-TP; M&amp;B28767-EP3) in<br>
porcine retinal microvascular contractility assay;<br>
[0030] Figure 6A shows improvements in kidney function as<br>
assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) and<br>
urine output in response to iv bolus (1mg/kg) of 213.29 in the rat renal artery<br>
occlusion (RAO) model. As a control, fenoldopam (0.6 ug/kg bolus, followed<br>
by 0.6 ug/kg/h for the duration of the experiment) was used. Figure 6B shows<br>
blood urea nitrogen (urea) and creatinine levels in response to 213.29 and<br>
fenoldopam in the rat RAO model (kidney function parameters are given in<br>
Figure 6A), (Sham means sham-operated rats as control);<br>
[0031] Figure 7 shows a graphical representation of kidney<br>
histology (erythrocyte extravasation in periglomerular space and tubules<br>
presenting occlusions) in rats that underwent bilateral renal artery clamping<br>
for 1 hour and received qd (once daily)1 mg/kg of 213.29 iv Bolus. The results<br>
show that 213.29 treatment significantly reduced periglomerular erythrocyte<br>
extravasation and tubular occlusion, leading to better recovery of kidney<br>
function in the rat model of ischemic acute renal failure;<br>
[0032] Figure 8. shows improvements in kidney function as<br>
assessed by RPF, GFR, and UV-urine flow rate, obtained with qd (once a<br>
day) and bid (twice a day) administration of 213.29 (1 mg/kg iv bolus) in<br>
animals that underwent bilateral renal artery clamping for 1 hour; and<br>
[0033] Figure 9A shows kidney function parameters on day 5 in a<br>
rat model of acute tubular necrosis (rats injected with cisplatin ip 17.5 mg/kg<br>
on day 1). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow and urine output<br>
in saline (Sal) -treated rats, declined to extremely low levels by day 5;<br>
administration of 213.29 (1 mg/kg) on day 5 improved urinary parameters in<br>
saline-treated rats. However treating rats with 213.29 (5 mg/kg tid), starting<br>
on day 2, nearly normalized all parameters of kidney function by day 5; the<br>
improvement in kidney function correlated with decreases in blood urea<br>
nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Figure. 9B shows a graphical<br>
presentation of kidney histology from cisplatin-treated rats. 213.29 treatment<br>
(5 mg/kg tid) reduced hypertrophic glomeruli as well as the number of<br>
collecting ducts containing occlusions.<br>
[0034] Other objects, advantages and features of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following non-<br>
restrictive description of preferred embodiments with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, which is exemplary and should not be interpreted as<br>
limiting the scope of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0035] In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of<br>
the terms used in the present specification, a number of definitions are<br>
provided below.<br>
[0036] The term "agonist", as used herein, is understood as being<br>
an agent that potentiates at least one aspect of EP4 bioactivity. EP4<br>
bioactivity can be increased for example, by stimulating the wild-type activity<br>
and by stimulating signal transduction, or by enabling the wild type EP4<br>
protein to interact more efficiently with other proteins which are involved in<br>
signal transduction cascades.<br>
[0037] The term "antagonist", as used herein, is understood as<br>
being an agent that inhibits at least one aspect of EP4 bioactivity. An EP4<br>
antagonist can be a compound that inhibits or decreases the interaction<br>
between an EP4 molecule and another molecule, or decreases the synthesis<br>
and expression of an EP4 polypeptide, or inhibits the bioactivity of an EP4<br>
molecule. The antagonist can be a nucleic acid molecule such as a dominant<br>
negative form of EP4, an EP4 antisense molecule, a ribozyme capable of<br>
specifically interacting with EP4 mRNA, or molecules that bind to an EP4<br>
polypeptide (e.g. peptides, peptidomimetics, antibodies, small molecules).<br>
[0038] The term "amino acid", as used herein, is understood as<br>
including both the L and D isomers of the naturally occurring amino acids, as<br>
well as other nonproteinaceous amino acids used in peptide chemistry to<br>
prepare synthetic analogs of peptides. Examples of naturally-occurring amino<br>
acids include, but are not limited to glycine, alanine, valine, leucine,<br>
isoleucine, serine, and threonine. Examples of nonproteinaceous amino acids<br>
include, but are not limited to norleucine, norvaline, cyclohexyl alanine,<br>
biphenyl alanine, homophenyl alanine, naphthyl alanine, pyridyl alanine, and<br>
substituted phenyl alanines (substituted with a or more substituents including<br>
but not limited to alkoxy, halogen and nitro groups). Beta and gamma amino<br>
acids are also within the scope of the term "amino acid". These compounds<br>
are known to persons skilled in the art of peptide chemistry.<br>
[0039] For the purpose of clarity, commonly accepted notations of<br>
amino acids are given below:<br>
[0040] The term "polar amino acid", as used herein, is understood<br>
as referring to any amino acid containing an uncharged side chain that is<br>
relatively soluble in water.<br>
[0041] The term "hydrophobic amino acid", as used herein, is<br>
understood as referring to any amino acid containing an uncharged side chain<br>
that is sparingly soluble in water.<br>
[0042] The term "related amino acid", as used herein, is<br>
understood as referring to an alpha, beta or gamma substituted amino acid,<br>
natural or synthetic in origin, capable of mimicking the functionality of the side<br>
chain (e.g. aromatic, aliphatic, charged, polar, H-donor, H-acceptor).<br>
Examples of substitutions include, but are not limited to those provided in<br>
Tables 1 and 2.<br>
[0043] The terms "biological activity", "bioactivity" or "biological<br>
function", as used interchangeably herein, are understood as referring to a<br>
function that is directly or indirectly performed by an EP4 polypeptide, or by<br>
any fragment thereof. Biological activities of EP4 include, but are not limited<br>
to binding to another molecule, interacting with other proteins, alterations in<br>
signal transduction such as guanine nucleotide binding by Got proteins,<br>
calcium fluxes, cAMP synthesis, inositol phosphate synthesis, internalization<br>
of EP4 polypeptide, associating with other intracellular proteins or coated pits<br>
in the cell membrane. A description of bioassays of the EP4 receptor is<br>
provided below.<br>
[0044] The terms "cells", "host cells" or "recombinant host cells",<br>
as used interchangeably herein, are understood as referring not only to the<br>
particular cell, but to all its progeny. Also understood as being within the<br>
scope of these terms are cells of mammalian, amphibian, fungal, and<br>
bacterial origin.<br>
[0045] The term "modulation", as used herein, is understood as<br>
referring to both upregulation [i.e., activation or stimulation (e.g., by agonizing<br>
or potentiating)] and downregulation [i.e. inhibition or suppression (e.g., by<br>
antagonizing, decreasing or inhibiting)].<br>
[0046] The terms "protein" and "polypeptide", as used<br>
interchangeably herein, are understood as referring to a gene product.<br>
[0047] The term "peptide", as used herein, is understood as<br>
referring to a linear polymer containing at least 2 amino acids and a maximum<br>
of about 50 amino acids. The amino acids can be naturally-occurring, or<br>
synthetically-derived molecules. Examples of such molecules include, but are<br>
not limited to L-amino acids, D-amino acids, and synthetic analogues of<br>
natural amino acids including but not limited to non-proteinaceous amino<br>
acids.<br>
[0048] The term "peptidomimetic", as used herein, is understood<br>

of a peptide. A person skilled in the art uses a variety of methods to derive<br>
peptidomimetics of a particular peptide such as, but not limited to:<br>
substitutions of individual amino acids with synthetic chemical entities, non-<br>
proteinaceous amino acid analogues, deletions and additions of amino<br>
acids, replacing one or more amino acids in the peptide with scaffolds such<br>
as beta turn mimetics, or with known pharmacophores. The objective of<br>
deriving a peptidomimetic is to obtain a superior molecular analogue of the<br>
peptide in terms of potency, efficacy, and which has a smaller size and has a<br>
better pharmacological and toxicological profile than the parent peptide.<br>
[0049]The term "small molecule", as used herein, is understood as referring<br>

EP4 Antagonists<br>
[0077] In the present invention a set of peptides have been<br>
synthesized, based on the sequence of peptide 213.15 (SEQ ID NO: 1). Due<br>
to its poor solubility, the potential of this peptide as a therapeutic agent is<br>
limited. A library of peptides containing various modifications of peptide<br>
213.15 was synthesized, and characterized in terms of serum degradation,<br>
solubility, and pharmacological efficacy and potency in normal animals as well<br>
as in the rat model of acute renal failure. Based on these analyses, several<br>
peptides, more specifically peptides listed as Seq. ID Nos. 2-13, were<br>
identified.<br>
Optimization of EP4 Antagonist 213.15 (SEQ ID NO: 1)<br>
[0078] In order to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the peptidic<br>
lead compounds of the present invention, several modifications of the peptide<br>
were made by substituting one amino acid with a related amino acid or by<br>
adding amino acids to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. Substitutions of<br>
the amino acids of the EP4 peptidic antagonists of the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to a variant wherein at least one amino acid<br>
residue in the polypeptide has been replaced by a different amino acid, either<br>
related by structure or by side chain functionality (aromatic, aliphatic and<br>
positively- or negatively-charged). Such substitutions are preferably made in<br>
accordance with the following description of relations among amino acids.<br>
[0079] Table 1: Examples of related amino acids<br><br>
[0080] As illustrated in Table 2, another group of substitutions of<br>
the peptidic EP4 antagonists of the present invention involves those wherein<br>
at least one amino acid residue has been removed and is substituted by a<br>
different residue, which is inserted in its place.<br>
[0081] Table 2: Relations among amino acids<br><br>
[0082] The three amino acid residues placed between parentheses<br>
in Table 2, play a special role in protein architecture. "Gly" is the only residue<br>
lacking any side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain. This however<br>
tends to promote the formation of a secondary structure other than the alpha-<br>
helical structure. "Pro", because of its geometry, tightly constrains the chain.<br>
It generally tends to promote beta turn-like structures. "Cys" is capable of<br>
participating in disulfide bond formation.<br>
[0083] "Tyr", because of its hydrogen bonding potential, has<br>
significant kinship with "Ser" and Thr".<br>
[0084] Any amino acid component of the EP4 peptidic antagonists<br>
of the present invention can be substituted by its corresponding enantiomer<br>
(the same amino add but of opposite chirality). Therefore, any amino acid<br>
naturally occurring in the L-configuration may be substituted by its<br>
corresponding enantiomer, that is, an amino acid having the D-configuration.<br>
Amino acids of the L-configuration have the same chemical structural type as<br>
the amino acids of the D-configuration, but have opposite chirality. The L- and<br>
D- configuration can also generally be referred to as R- or the S-<br>
configuration. Additional variations include p- and y-amino acids, providing for<br>
a different spatial arrangement of chemical groups.<br>
[0085] In addition to the substitutions outlined above, synthetic<br>
amino acids providing similar side chain functionality can also be introduced<br>
into the peptide. For example, aromatic amino acids may be replaced with D-<br>
or L-naphthylalanine, D- or L-phenylglycine, D- or L-2-thienylalanine, D- or L-<br>
1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-pyrenylalanine, D- or L-3-thienylalanine, D- or L-(2-pyridinyl)-<br>
alanine, D- or L-(3-pyridinyl)-alanine, D- or L-(2-pyrazinyl)-alanine, D- or L-(4-<br>
isopropyl)-phenylglycine, D-(trifluoromethyl)-phenylglycine, D-(trifluoromethyl)-<br>
phenylalanine, D-p-fluorophenylalanine, D- or L-p-biphenylalanine D- or L-p-<br>
methoxybiphenylalanine, D- or L-2-indole(alkyl)alanines, and D- or L-<br>
alkylalanines wherein the alkyl group is selected from the group consisting of<br>
substituted or unsubstituted methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl, butyl, pentyi,<br>
isopropyl, iso-butyl, and iso-pentyl.<br>
[0086] Non-carboxylate amino acids can be made to possess a<br>
negative charge, as provided by phosphono- or sulfated (e.g. -SO3H) amino<br>
acids, which are to be considered as non-limiting examples.<br>
[0087] Other substitutions may include unnatural alkylated amino<br>
acids, made by combining an alkyl group with any natural amino acid. Basic<br>
natural amino acids such as lysine and arginine may be substituted with alkyl<br>
groups at the amine (NH2) functionality. Yet other substitutions include nitrile<br>
derivatives (e.g., containing a CN-moiety in place of the CONH2 functionality)<br>
of asparagine or glutamine, and sulfoxide derivative of methionine. In<br>
addition, any amide linkage in the peptide may be replaced by a<br>
ketomethylene, hydroxyethyl, ethyl/reduced amide, thioamide or reversed<br>
amide moieties, (e.g. (-C=0)-CH2-), (-CHOH)-CHr), (CH2-CH2-), (-C=S)-NH-),<br>
or (-NH-(-C=O) for (-C=O)-NH-)).<br>
[0088] Covalent modifications of the peptides are thus included<br>
within the scope of the present invention. Such modifications may be<br>
introduced into EP4 peptidic antagonists by reacting targeted amino acid<br>
residues of the polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent capable of<br>
reacting with selected side chains or terminal residues of the polypeptide. The<br>
following examples of chemical derivatives are provided by way of illustration<br>
only, and are not meant the limit the scope of the present invention. Cysteinyl<br>
residues may be reacted with alpha-haloacetates (and corresponding<br>
amines), such as 2-chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to provide<br>
carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Histidyl residues may be<br>
derivatized by reaction with compounds such as diethylpyrocarbonate (e.g.,<br>
at pH 5.5-7.0) because this reagent is relatively specific for the histidyl side<br>
chain. p-Bromophenacyl bromide may also be used (e.g., where the reaction<br>
is preferably performed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0). Lysinyl and<br>
amino terminal residues may be reacted with compounds such as succinic or<br>
other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing<br>
alpha-amino-containing residues include compounds such as imidoesters<br>
(e.g. methyl picolinimidate); pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal;<br>
chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea; 2,4<br>
pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.<br>
[0089] Arginyl residues may be modified by reaction with one or<br>
several conventional reagents, such as phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-<br>
cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin, according to known method steps. The<br>
derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed<br>
under alkaline conditions, because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional<br>
group. Furthermore, these reagents may also react with the amine groups of<br>
lysine, as well as with the arginine epsilon-amino group.<br>
[0090] The specific modification of tyrosinyl residues per se is well-<br>
known. Specific and non-limiting examples include the introduction of spectral<br>
labels onto tyrosinyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds<br>
or tetranitromethane. N-acetylimidazol and tetranitromethane may be used to<br>
form O-acetyl tyrosinyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.<br>
[0091] Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) may be<br>
selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R'-N=C=N-R') such as 1-<br>
cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl- (4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-<br>
dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore aspartyl and glutamyl residues<br>
may be converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with<br>
ammonium ions. Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues may be deamidated to<br>
the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues.<br>
[0092] Other modifications of the peptides of the present invention<br>
may include hydroxylation of proline and lysine; phosphorylation of the<br>
hydroxyl group of seryl or threonyl residues; methylation of the alpha-amino<br>
group of lysine, arginine, and histidine; acetylation of the N-terminal amine;<br>
methylation of main chain amide residues (or substitution with N-methyl amino<br>
acids) and, in some instances, amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl groups,<br>
according to methods known in the art.<br>
[0093] Covalent attachment of fatty acids (C6-C18) to the peptides<br>
of the present invention confers additional biological properties such as for<br>
example protease resitance, plasma protein binding, increased plasma half<br>
life, and intracellular penetration.<br>
[0094] The above description of possible modifications of a lead<br>
peptide should not be considered as a limitation to the scope of the<br>
approaches, nor should it be considered as a limitation to the possible<br>
modifications that can be engineered using a lead peptide such as 213.15 as<br>
the template. Due to the complex nature of peptide folding, neither the<br>
receptor-bound conformation of the peptide antagonist, nor the effects of the<br>
modified peptides on EP4 bioactivity can be predicted with absolute certainty.<br>
Hence, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the modified<br>
peptides should be tested in bioassays as described in the present invention<br>
or in those known in the art to the person of ordinary skill, in order to confirm<br>
biological activity. Non-limiting examples of assays include receptor binding<br>
or modulation of ligand binding to the corresponding GPCR. Specific<br>
examples pertaining to GPCRs and more particularly to the EP4 receptor in<br>
terms of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays are known to persons skilled in the<br>
art, and selected examples are depicted in the Figures and are described<br>
below.<br>
EP4 Receptor Bioassavs<br>
[0095] There are many published methods of assaying EP4<br>
bioactivity, using either purified or crude preparations of EP4 (cell-free assays;<br>
see below) from tissues or cells in which EP4 is recombinantly expressed in<br>
heterologous bacterial, fungal or mammalian expression systems.<br>
[0096] Cell-free assays can be used to identify compounds which<br>
are capable of interacting with an EP4 protein, thereby modifying the activity<br>
of the EP4 protein. Such a compound can, for example, modify the structure<br>
of an EP4 protein and thereby affect its activity. Cell-free assays can also be<br>
used to identify compounds which modulate the interaction between an EP4<br>
protein and an EP4 binding partner. An EP4 binding partner is PGE2. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, cell-free assays used for identifying such compounds<br>
consist essentially of a mixture containing a buffered solution, EP4 protein,<br>
EP4 binding partner and a test compound. A test compound can be for<br>
example, a peptide, a peptidomimetic, a small molecule, and a nucleic acid.<br>
For detection purposes, the binding partner can be labeled with a specific<br>
marker such as a radionuclide, with a fluorescent compound or with an<br>
enzyme. The interaction of a test compound with an EP4 protein can then be<br>
detected by determining the level of the marker after an incubation step and<br>
a washing step. A statistically significant change (potentiation or inhibition) in<br>
the interaction of the EP4 and EP4 binding protein in the presence of the test<br>
compound, relative to the interaction in the absence of the test compound,<br>
indicates a potential agonistic effect (mimetic or potentiator) or antagonistic<br>
effect (inhibitor) of EP4 bioactivity for the test compound. Radiolabeled<br>
samples are counted and quantified by scintillation spectrophotometry.<br>
Binding ligands can be conjugated to enzymes such as acetyl choline<br>
esterase and bound EP4-binding partner can be quantified by enzyme assay.<br>
[0097] Cell-free assays can also be used to identify compounds<br>
which interact with an EP4 protein and which modulate an activity of an EP4<br>
protein. Accordingly, in one embodiment, an EP4 protein is contacted with a<br>
test compound, and the bioactivity of the EP4 protein is monitored. The<br>
bioactivity of the EP4 protein in cell-free assays include, but is not limited to<br>
GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis, dissociation of Ga proteins, adenylate cyclase<br>
activation, phospholipase (A2, beta, gamma and D isoforms) activation,<br>
phospholipid hydrolysis and cAMP synthesis. The methods of measuring<br>
these changes in the bioactivity of a GPCR protein are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Cell-Based Assays of EP4 Bioactivitv<br>
[0098] EP4 bioactivity can also be measured using whole bacterial,<br>
fungal, amphibian or mammalian cells (see cell-based assays described<br>
below), in which the EP4 protein is recombinantly expressed as a native<br>
protein or as a fusion protein, (e.g. EP4 conjugated to antibody epitope tags,<br>
green fluorescent protein, Got or p-arrestin). Fusion proteins have certain<br>
advantages over native proteins; fusion proteins can provide direct detection<br>
of EP4 polypeptides or EP4 bioactivity in cells, tissues and organisms.<br>
Epitope (FLAG, HA, polyHIS, c-myc, etc.)-tagged EP4 can be useful in<br>
tracking the protein in cells and tissues by immunochemical staining methods,<br>
and may aid in the isolation of pure or substantially-pure proteins of EP4<br>
through immunoaffinity chromatography. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)<br>
fusion to the EP4 protein can be used to locate and follow the movements of<br>
EP4, such as for example its aggregation or association with other cellular<br>
proteins, intemalization, trafficking, degradation in endocytotic vesicles, in<br>
living or fixed cells. EP4 fusions of GFP and luciferase can be used to study<br>
and monitor dimer and oligomer formation and association with other<br>
signaling molecules. EP4-Ga protein fusions can be used to measure GTP<br>
binding and hydrolysis by the G protein in response to agonists or<br>
antagonists, and these methods, known to persons skilled in the art, are used<br>
to screen and/or test small molecule compound libraries for agonist or<br>
antagonist activity. These examples illustrate, but are not intended to limit the<br>
potential fusion partners and their uses in basic and applied scientific studies.<br>
[0099] Cell based assays can be used for example, to identify<br>
compounds that modulate the bioactivity of the EP4 protein, and the<br>
expression of an EP4 gene or those genes that are induced or suppressed in<br>
response to increased or decreased bioactivity of the EP4 protein.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, a cell capable of producing EP4 is incubated<br>
with a test compound in the presence or absence of a natural or synthetic<br>
agonist/antagonist of EP4, and the bioactivity of EP4 is measured. The<br>
resultant alterations in the bioactivity of EP4 are compared to control EP4<br>
producing cells, which have not been contacted with the test compound.<br>
These measurements are used to assess the potency, affinity and action of<br>
the test compound towards modulating EP4 bioactivity.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
[0100] The present invention provides for both prophylactic and<br>
therapeutic methods of treating a patient diagnosed with reduced urine output<br>
and acute or chronic renal impairment. Administration of a prophylactic agent<br>
can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the EP4<br>
aberrancy, such that the medical condition and its consequences are<br>
prevented or, alternatively, its progression delayed. In general, the<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic methods comprise administering a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of an EP4 antagonist to a subject in need thereof. As<br>
described in the present invention, examples of suitable EP4 antagonists and<br>
derivatives thereof include, but are not limited to peptides, peptidomimetics<br>
and small molecule mimetics.<br>
[0101] Data supporting the therapeutic use of the EP4 antagonists<br>
of the present invention, and derivatives thereof, for the treatment of human<br>
renal insufficiency disorders characterized by reduced urine output, increased<br>
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, was obtained from animal<br>
models of nephropathy. Renal insufficiency in acute renal failure may arise<br>
due to ischemia, secondary to poor renal perfusion or due to nephrotoxic<br>
insults mediated by radiocontrast agents, antineoplastics, antibiotics,<br>
immunosuppressive agents and heavy metals. Two rat models in which renal<br>
insufficiency has been produced by bilateral renal artery occlusion (ischemic<br>
nephropathy) or cisplatin injection (acute tubular necrosis), have been well<br>
characterized and shown to approximate the renal damage suffered by<br>
human patients (see review by Lieberthal, W., Nigam, S.K. (2000); Am. J.<br>
Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 278(1):F1-F12). Both rat models were used to<br>
illustrate the utility of the EP4 antagonists of the present invention, and<br>
derivatives thereof, for improving renal damage as well as kidney function.<br>
Several examples are provided in which the use of the EP4 antagonists of the<br>
present invention, as well as derivatives thereof, showed improved glomerular<br>
filtration, renal blood flow and urine output in rats, dogs and pigs. It is<br>
expected that the pharmacological efficacy of the EP4 antagonists of the<br>
present invention, as illustrated in diverse species (rats, dogs and pigs)<br>
extends to human subjects as well, based on the similarities in receptor<br>
sequences and their tissue distribution.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations of EP4 antagonists<br>
[0102] The toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the EP4 antagonists<br>
of the present invention, such as the LD50 (lethal dose to 50% of the<br>
population) and the ED50 (the therapeutically effective dose in 50% of the<br>
population) can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in<br>
experimental animals. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects<br>
is known as the therapeutic index, and which can be expressed as the<br>
LD50/ED50 ratio. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indexes are<br>
preferred. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of<br>
circulating concentrations that includes the ED50 but with little or no toxicity.<br>
The dosage may vary within this range, depending on the dosage form<br>
employed and the route of administration. A dose may be formulated in<br>
animal models in order to obtain a circulating plasma concentration range that<br>
includes the IC50 (the concentration of the test compound that achieves a 50%<br>
inhibition of the symptoms) as determined in in vitro and ex vivo assays and<br>
in animal studies. Such information can then be used to more accurately<br>
determine useful doses in humans. Plasma levels of EP4 antagonists can be<br>
measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography coupled<br>
with mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS). The effective dose of an EP4 antagonist<br>
could be 0.01 micrograms to 100 mg/kg and is determined by the route of<br>
administration, pharmaceutical preparation and the mode of delivery.<br>
[0103] The present invention is illustrated in further detail by the<br>
following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Chemical synthesis of peptides<br>
[0104] Several peptides, based on the structure of 213.15 (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 1), were synthesized using F-moc chemistry and the solid phase<br>
Merrifield peptide method. The structures of these peptides are listed in Table<br>
3 (SEQ ID NOS: 2-13). The purity of the trifluoroacetate salts of these<br>
peptides was assessed by HPLC and mass spectroscopy. The general<br>
synthesis methods will be better understood by referring to the following<br>
treatises: "Solid phase peptide synthesis". Stewart &amp; Young, W. H. Freeman<br>
Co. San Francisco, 1969; "The proteins". Erikson and Merrifield, Vol. 2. (ed.<br>
Neurath &amp; Hill), Academic Press, New York. 1976. The solubility of the<br>
peptides in water is also listed in Table 3.<br>

in a rat model of ischemic nephropathv<br>
[0105] Bilateral clamping of the renal arteries for 30-60 minutes<br>
results in the reperfusion of the kidneys and associated sequelae such as a<br>
dramatic decrease in glomerular filtration rate, urine output and tubular cell<br>
death. This model reproduces some important consequences of oligouric<br>
renal failure in humans. The efficacy of various 213.15 derivatives in reversing<br>
the renal damage was measured.<br>
Ischemic nephropathy model<br>
[0106] Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized and the<br>
jugular vein was canulated for infusion with the peptide or with saline. In<br>
addition, the carotid artery was canulated to measure the arterial blood<br>
pressure with a pressure transducer (Gould) and to collect blood samples.<br>
The urinary bladder was canulated to collect urine. After catheterization, an<br>
infusion (1.6 ml/hr) of a mixture of [3H] inulin (8 mCi/hr), [14C] aminohippuric<br>
acid (0.8 nCi/hr) and anesthetics (ketamine and xylazine; 9:1 w:w; 0.095<br>
ml/ml) was started. The animals were allowed to stabilize for a further 40<br>
minutes. Two urine samples were collected over 10 minute periods, (from 40<br>
to 50 minutes, and from 50 to 60 minutes) to assess the stability of the basal<br>
GFR. Blood samples were collected at 45 and 55 minutes respectively. The<br>
left and right renal arteries were then clamped for a period of 60 minutes to<br>
induce an acute renal ischemia. After the ischemic period, the animals were<br>
treated with peptides, 213.19-213.30, (1 mg/kg iv bolus) or with saline via the<br>
jugular vein. Blood and urine samples were then collected every 20 minutes<br>
for an additional period of 2 hours. Glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and urine<br>
flow rates, (measured by the [3H] inulin method) as well as renal plasma flow<br>
(measured by the [14C] aminohippuric acid method), were determined at<br>
different times and averaged for a 60 minute (20-80 minutes following the<br>
drug administration) period.<br>
"Capital letters indicate L-amino acids; small letters indicate D-amino acids; bip: D-(4,4) biphenyl<br>
alanine; Bip: L-(4,4)biphenyl alanine.<br>
* Solubility is determined in water.<br>
[0108] The results on the urine flow rate (Figure 1A) and on GFR (Figure 1<br>
B) are expressed as average urine flow rate and average GFR over a 60<br>
minute period starting 20 minutes after the administration of the drugs. The<br>
order of efficacy for urine output was determined to be: 213.15 <br>
213.21; other peptides were of similar efficacy to 213.15. Similarly, 213.19 and<br>
213.21 also showed an increase in GFR. An improvement in GFR was not<br>
observed for the other peptides. Peptides 213.19 and 213.21 were<br>
consistently superior to the other peptides in causing improvements in GFR,<br>
urine flow rate and renal plasma flow.<br>
[0109] Based on the structure of 213.21, four more analogues, 213.27-<br>
213.30, were synthesized and tested in the rat model of renal artery occlusion.<br>
The results of GFR (averaged over 60 minutes and starting 20<br>
minutes after the injection of the drug) are shown in Figure 1C. For<br>
comparison, 213.15 and 213.21 are included in the figure. Both 213.28 and<br>
213.29 increased GFR 4 and 5 fold, comparatively to 213.15, over the course<br>
of a 40 minute period following the unclamping of the renal artery. Of the<br>
compounds tested, 213.28 and 213.29, which are also more soluble (Table<br>
3), are found to be more efficacious than the parent compound, 213.15.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Dose response of 213.29 on kidney function in normal rat dog and<br>
piglet<br>
[0110] The dose response of 213.29 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,10 mg/kg bolus<br>
iv) was tested in anesthetized female Beagle dogs. Following an acclimation<br>
of at least one week, and overnight fasting, each animal was anesthetized<br>
with an iv injection of Thiopental (5 mg/Kg); the anesthesia was continued<br>
under isoflurane. The animal was kept warm and the body temperature<br>
monitored every 15 minutes. A carotid catheter for monitoring the blood<br>
pressure and a urethral catheter for collecting urine were installed. A constant<br>
iv infusion of saline (10 mL/kg/h), containing a total dose of 0.05 mCi of [3H]<br>
inulin and 0.005 mCi of [14C] para-aminohyppuric acid (PAH), sufficient for 5<br>
hours of infusion, was initiated. A urine sample was collected every 10<br>
minutes. In the middle of each 10-minute period, a blood sample was<br>
collected. After 60 minutes of equilibration of the radiolabels, incremental<br>
doses of 213.29 were injected intravenously via the cephalic vein.<br>
[0111] The radioactivity in the blood and urine samples (n=30/dog)<br>
was determined by scintillation spectrometry. The results of the study are<br>
shown in Figure 2A. A dramatic and maximal increase in GFR as well as urine<br>
flow rate was observed at 4 mg/kg of 213.29 in normal dogs. Figure 2B<br>
additionally shows the results of similar studies that were conducted in rats<br>
and piglets. The doses at which maximal responses in GFR, urine flow and<br>
renal plasma flow were observed, are indicated in the inset of Figure 2B (n =<br>
number of animals). The results show that 213.29 causes increased renal<br>
perfusion, elevated GFR, and increased urine output in a species-<br>
independent manner. These results suggest that 213.29 would be effective<br>
in increasing renal perfusion, GFR and urine flow in humans.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Effect of 213.29 on PGE2-induced dilation of porcine lower<br>
saphenous venous rings<br>
Animals<br>
[0112] Yorkshire piglets (2-4 days old) were used in this study,<br>
according to a protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee of the<br>
Research Center of the St.-Justine Hospital. Briefly, animals were<br>
anesthetized with halothane (1.5%) and the lower external saphenous veins<br>
removed and placed in cold Krebs buffer (pH 7.4) having the following<br>
composition (mM): NaCI 120, KCI 4.5, CaCI2 2.5, MgSO4 1.0, NaHCO3 27,<br>
KH2PO4 1.0, glucose 10, to which 1.5 U/ml heparin was added.<br>
Organ bath assay<br>
[0113] The saphenous veins were cleaned of extraneous tissue<br>
and cut into 4 mm rings which were placed in individual jacketed organ baths<br>
(15 ml; Radnoti Glass, Monrovia, CA) containing Krebs buffer and maintained<br>
at 37Â°C. The solution was bubbled with an O2 / CO2 mixture (95/5). In each<br>
experiment, 8 rings were used (4 from each saphenous vein) and were<br>
equilibrated for 60 minutes under 2.0 gr. passive tension with frequent<br>
washing and tension adjustment. The tension was measured by force-<br>
displacement transducers and was recorded on a computerized data<br>
acquisition system using the Work Bench software (both from Kent Scientific,<br>
Litchfield, CT).<br>
Experimental protocol<br>
[0114] The vasodilatory response of the lower external saphenous<br>
veins to PGE2 appears to result from the stimulation of EP2 (30%) and EP4<br>
(70%). The tissues were initially challenged with U46619 (2 x 10-7M)<br>
(thromboxane A2 mimic) which induced a 1.5 to 2.0 gr. increase in tension.<br>
The rings which did not respond were discarded. When the response to<br>
U46619 reached a steady state, agents were added. When no response to<br>
the agents were observed, a period of 30 minutes was allowed to insure<br>
proper distribution of the agents in the tissue. Dose-response curves to PGE2<br>
(10-10 -10-6 M) were then obtained in the presence or absence of each of the<br>
tested drugs.<br>
[0115] The results, which are an average of 2-8 experiments, are<br>
shown in Figure 3. The results are expressed as percent reversal of dilation<br>
produced by 1 uM PGE2 in porcine lower saphenous venous rings<br>
precontacted with 1 uM U46619 (thromboxane A2 mimetic) in the presence<br>
of 1 uM of peptide. 213.29 reversed approximately 50% of the dilatory effect<br>
of PGE2 in this tissue.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Stability of 213.29 in human serum and the biological activity of the<br>
metabolites<br>
[0116] The 213.29 peptide contains L-amino acids which could be<br>
susceptible to the action of serum proteases. In order to characterize the<br>
degradation products of 213.29, aliquots (100 ug) were incubated in human<br>
serum (0.5 ml) for varying periods of time at 37Â°C. The reaction was<br>
quenched with trifluoroacetic acid (0.24 ml; 1M), incubated on ice for 10<br>
minutes following a further addition of TFA (0.25 ml; 0.05%), and centrifuged<br>
to precipitate the flocculates. The supernatants were purified by solid phase<br>
extraction on SepPak Cia cartridges. The peptide was eluted with 80%<br>
acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA and the eluates lyophilized. The peptide was then<br>
redissolved in acetic acid (400 ml of 0.1 N) and subjected to separation by<br>
reverse phase HPLC on C18 columns. The peak containing fractions were<br>
collected and the mass of the peptide fragments determined by MALDI-TOF.<br>
[0117] Figure 4A shows the degradation of 213.29 over time, and<br>
the appearance of one of the metabolic products lacking one carboxyterminal<br>
lysine (213.291) (Figure 4B). The cleavage was rapid with a half life of 
minutes. The second metabolite, 213.292 (Figure 4B) was not observed in the<br>
present experiment, and is slow to appear in the degradation reaction.<br>
[0118] In order to test whether the metabolites also possessed<br>
biological activity, peptides 213.29,213.291 and 213.292 were incubated with<br>
HEK293 cells recombinantly expressing human EP4 receptor, in the presence<br>
of 100 nM PGE2. cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay and<br>
the results are illustrated in Figure 4B. The peptides by themselves did not<br>
elicit stimulation of the receptor, but inhibited PGE2-stimulated cAMP<br>
synthesis by 20-30%.<br>
Example 6<br>
Selectivity of 213.29 antagonism to prostanoid receptor EP4<br>
[0119] In order to demonstrate that 213.29 does not affect the<br>
biological responses of other prostanoid receptors, selective ligands<br>
(butaprost-EP2; 17-phenyl PGE2-EP1; PGF2a-FP; U46619-TP; M&amp;B28767-<br>
EP3) of prostanoid receptors were used in an ex vivo assay of vascular<br>
constriction in porcine retinas which was previously described and validated<br>
(Li, D.Y., Abran, D., Peri, K.G., Varma, D.R., Chemtob, S. (1996); J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 278(1 ):370-7). Since prostanoid receptor densities in<br>
newborn vasculature are minimal, due to down regulation by high levels of<br>
circulating prostaglandins in the perinatal period, the newborn pigs were<br>
treated with a prostagtandin synthase blocker, ibuprofen (30 mg/Kg of<br>
bodyweight/ 8 h for 24 h) to increase the density of the receptors as well as<br>
their vasomotor effects.<br>
Method<br>
[0120] To prepare eyecups, a circular incision was made 3-4 mm<br>
posterior to ora serrata, to remove the interior segment and vitreous body with<br>
minimal handling of the retina. The remaining eyecup was fixed with pins to<br>
a wax base in a 20 ml tissue bath containing 20 ml of Kreb's buffer (pH 7.35-<br>
7.45) and equilibrated with 21% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 Â°C. The<br>
preparations were allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes.<br>
[0121] 213.29 (10 mM) was added 5 minutes prior to the addition<br>
of 0.1 uM of ligands to the bath fluid. The outer vessel diameter was recorded<br>
with a video camera mounted on a dissecting microscope (Zeiss M 400) and<br>
the responses were quantified by a digital image analyzer (Sigma Scan<br>
Software, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). The vascular diameter was<br>
recorded prior to, and 5 minutes following the topical application of the<br>
agonist. Each measurement was repeated three times and showed 
variability. As shown in Figure 5, 213.29 did not affect the contractile or<br>
dilatory responses of receptor selective agonists of prostanoid receptors.<br>
Thus 213.29 appeared to be highly selective to prostanoid receptor EP4.<br>
Example 7<br>
Comparision of 213.29 to Fenoldopam in the improvement of kidney<br>
function in the rat model of ischemic nephropathy<br>
[0122] Fenoldopam is a dopamine receptor subtype 1 agonist, and<br>
has been shown to increase urine output in limited clinical and animal studies<br>
(Singer, I. and Epstein, M. 1998; Am. J. Kidney Dis. 31(5):743-55). The<br>
efficacy of fenoldopam and 213.29, in improving kidney function in the rat<br>
model of ischemic nephropathy (described in Example 2) was compared.<br>
213.29 was given as an iv bolus of 1 mg/kg whereas fenoldopam was given<br>
as an iv bolus of 0.6 ug/kg followed by 0.6 ug/kg/h for the duration of the<br>
experiment. As shown in Figure 6A, both fenoldopam and 213.29 increased<br>
urine output to a similar extent, but only 213.29 was able to improve renal<br>
perfusion and GFR significantly. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum<br>
creatinine levels were measured after 72 hours and as shown in Figure 6B,<br>
both fenoldopam and 213.29 were equally efficacious in reducing BUN and<br>
creatinine levels.<br>
Example 8<br>
Protective effect of 213.29 administration in rats that suffered renal<br>
failure fin the rat model of ischemic nephrooathv)<br>
[0123] The kidneys from the animals used in Example 7 were<br>
collected 24 hours or 72 hours after the unclamping of the renal arteries and<br>
drug dosing. An histological examination of sections was performed.<br>
[0124] As shown in Figure 7, the number of glomeruli showing<br>
periglomerular extravasation was significantly reduced as a result of the<br>
treatment with 213.29. Similarly, the number of collecting ducts containing cell<br>
debris was significantly reduced by 213.29. These results point to the use of<br>
213.29 in improving kidney function as well as in protection from<br>
ultrastructural damage, ensuing from ischemic insults.<br>
Example 9<br>
Effect of ad vs bid administration of 213.29 in rats that suffered renal<br>
failure due to bilateral renal artery clamping<br>
[0125] In order to determiner whether increasing the frequency of<br>
administration of 213.29 has a beneficial effect on kidney function in the rat<br>
RAO-model, 1 mg/kg of 213.29 iv was injected once (qd) or twice (bid) a day<br>
and the kidney function compared on day 1 and day 5. The results obtained<br>
are shown in Figure 8. By day 4, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the renal<br>
plasma flow (RPF) and the urine flow rate (UV) improved to the same extent<br>
with a once a day (qd) or a twice a day (bid) administration. However, these<br>
parameters of kidney function showed a dramatic improvement on day 1<br>
when the drug is administered twice a day rather than once a day. Thus<br>
frequent dosing of 213.29 in conjunction with the pharmacokinetics of the<br>
drug may improve the kidney function in cases of renal insufficiency.<br>
Example 10<br>
Efficacy of 213.29 administration in rats that suffered acute tubular<br>
necrosis and renal failure due to cisplatin.<br>
[0126] Acute tubular necrosis and renal failure are a direct<br>
consequence of the use of radiocontrast agents, neoplastic compounds and<br>
antibiotics. The rat cisplatin-induced acute tubular necrosis model was shown<br>
to reproduce many features of the human disorder [Lieberthal, W., Nigam,<br>
S.K. (2000); Am. J Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 278(1):F1-F12 ].<br>
Cisplatin-induced acute tubular necrosis rat model<br>
[0127] Acute tubular necrosis was induced by injecting 17.5 mg/kg<br>
of cisplatin to Sprague-Dawley male rats on day 1. By day 5, the parameters<br>
of kidney function, namely GFR, RPF and UV, were dramatically reduced to<br>
negligible quantities (Sal [saline] column in Figure 9A). This was followed by<br>
a 50% mortality in cisplatin-treated rats. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and<br>
creatinine levels increased dramatically by day 5 (data not shown).<br>
[0128] In order to determine whether 213.29 could still be useful<br>
in these conditions, kidney function tests were conducted after injecting the<br>
rats with 1 mg/kg iv on day 5. As shown in Figure 9A, GFR, RPF and UV<br>
improved dramatically compared to the saline treated rats. The parameters<br>
of kidney function reached levels seen in normal healthy rats when the<br>
compound was given at 5 mg/kg three times a day (tid) starting on day 2 and<br>
continued till day 5 (Figure 9A). Both blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels<br>
were reduced as expected.<br>
[0129] The obtained results in two rat models of renal insufficiency<br>
(very well validated and accepted in the literature [Lieberthal, W., Nigam, S.K.<br>
(2000); Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 278(1):F1-F12 ] as models that<br>
reproduce important features of human acute renal failure due to ischemia or<br>
nephrotoxins), show that 213.29 and its derivatives improve kidney function<br>
and provide protection from exacerbation of renal damage. These compounds<br>
can therefore be used as therapeutic agents in human cases of acute renal<br>
failure and chronic renal insufficiency.<br>
[0130] Although the present has been described hereinabove by<br>
way of preferred embodiments thereof, it can be modified, without departing<br>
from the spirit and nature of the subject invention as defined in the appended<br>
