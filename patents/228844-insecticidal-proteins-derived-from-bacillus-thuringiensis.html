Novel Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal proteins<br>
The present invention relates to the field of plant pest control, particularly insect control. Provided are new nucleic acid sequences from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains, encoding insecticidal proteins expressed during vegetative growth stages. Particularly, DNA sequences encoding proteins designated as ISP3-1099E, ISP3-327D and ISP3-2245J are provided, which are useful to protect plants from insect damage. Further provided are plants and microorganisms comprising at least one of the new nucleic acid molecules, as well as methods and means for using these nucleic acid sequences for reducing insect damage of plants.<br>
Insect pests cause huge economic losses worldwide in crop production, and farmers face every year the threat of yield losses due to insect infestation. Genetic engineering of insect resistance in agricultural crops has been an attractive approach to reduce costs associated with crop-management and chemical control practices. The first generation of insect resistant crops have been introduced into the market since 1996, based on the expression in plants of proteins isolated from the gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The insecticidal Bt Cry proteins are produced during the sporulation-stage of Bt strains and the proteins accumulate in large cytoplasmic crystals within the bacterium. When taken up by insects, a typical Lepidopteran-toxic Bt Cry protein is solubilized and processed in the insect midgut into an active form of about 60 to 65kDa. The active protein exerts its toxic effect by binding to the midgut epithelial cells, causing pore formation in the cell membrane, which leads to osmotic :ysis of the cells (Gill et al., 1992).<br>
A Bt strain may produce many different toxins. Since the isolation of the first insecticidal crystein prorem encoding gene from Bt in 1981 (Schnepf and Whiteley, 1981) more than 100 Bt Cry toxin encoding genes have been cloned<br><br>
and insect pests have been effectively controlled by expressing Bt derived proteins in agricultural important crop species. However, the use of individual Bt proteins is often limited, as most Bt proteins are mostly only active against a relatively small number of the numerous existing insect pests. Specificity of Bt Cry proteins is thought to be determined by factors such as the activation of the toxin in the insect gut (Haider et al. 1986) and its ability to bind specific receptors (Hofmann et al., 1988).<br>
It is widely recognized that there is a risk that susceptible insect species may develop resistance against Bt Cry toxins. Consequently, active efforts have been made to identify novel insecticidal proteins. One strategy, which has been used, was to screen Bacillus strains for the production of insecticidal proteins during vegetative growth stages, rather than during sporulation stages. Using this approach a number of "vegetative insecticidal proteins" or "VIPs" have been identified.<br>
Estruch et al. (1996). W094/21795, WO96/10083, W098/44137, US 5,877,012, US 6,107,279, US 6.137,033 and US 6,291,156 describe the isolation of vip3A(a), vip3A(b) and vip3A(c) from supernatant fluids of Bt strains AB88. AB424 and AB51. According to the authors these genes encode proteins with insecticidal activity towards a broad range of Lepidopteran insect pests.<br>
W098/18932 and W099/57282 describe a number of nucleotide sequences isolated from Bt strains. These sequences are referred to as mis (mis-1 to mis-8), war and sup. According to the authors the encoded proteins have activity against Lepidopteran or Coieopteran pests.<br>
WO00/09697 describes heat-labile, soluble MIS-type and WAR-type toxins, as<br>
well as smaller (1 to 10kDa) toxins, obtainable from the supernatant of cultures of Bacillus laterosoorus strains, which, according to the authors, have activity against Western Corn Rootworm larvae.<br><br>
WO98/00546-and US 6,274,721 describe the isolation of Bt strains and Bt toxins, which, according to the authors, have activity against Lepidopteran pests.<br>
W099/33991 describes the isolation of Bt strains and Bt toxins, which, according to the authors, have activity against Lepidopteran pests.<br>
Recently, Selvapandiyan et al. (2001) described the isolation of a gene encoding a protein designated as VIP-S. According to the authors the VIP-S protein showed toxicity against a number of Lepidopteran insect species.<br>
Doss et al. (2002) describe the cloning of VIP3V from strain Bt kurstaki.<br>
WO02/078437 describes VIP3 toxins from Bt, such as VIP3A, VIP3B and VIP3A-B hybrid toxins.<br>
Despite the isolation and characterization of a relatively large number of different insecticidal proteins to date, there remains a need for identification, isolation and characterization of new insecticidal proteins. The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, due to the specificity of insecticidal proteins towards particular groups of target pests (host insect spectra), there is a need to clone genes encoding proteins with different spectra of activity, so that for different crops and different geographic regions suitable proteins for combating insect pests are available. The specificity of Bt Cry proteins, for example, is mostly limited. Identification of toxins with specificity towards different target insects remains desirable. Secondly, after prolonged use in one geographic region, insects are known to have the capacity to develop resistance towards chemical insecticides, microbial sprays (for example based on Bt spore-crystal mixtures), and are believed to have the capacity to develop resistance towards plants expressing insecticidal proteins. The development of resistance within insect populations could potentially render existing insecticidal proteins ineffective, providing a nee: -'or novel genes and proteins. Thirdly, for health and<br><br>
environmentalreasons it is desirable to identify proteins with high, specific insecticidal potency and acute bioactivity towards target insect species.<br>
Hereinafter, including the different embodiments described in the claims, more nucleic acid sequences and amino acid sequences isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis strains are described, which are useful to protect plants from insect damage, either by the expression of the nucleic acid sequences within plants under the control of suitable promoters, or by external application of the toxins to the plans. The toxins of the subject invention are distinct from previously described pesticidal toxins.<br>

"Insect-controlling amounts" of a protein, as used herein, refers to an amount of protein which is sufficient to limit damage on a plant, caused by insects (e.g. insect larvae) feeding on such plant, to commercially acceptable levels, e.g. by killing the insects or by inhibiting the insect development, fertility or growth in such a manner that they provide less damage to a plant and plant yield is not significantly adversely affected.<br>
In accordance with this invention, insects susceptible to the new ISP3 proteins of the invention are contacted with this protein in insect-controlling amounts, preferably insecticidal amounts. Preferred target insects for the proteins of this invention are economically damaging insect pests of corn, cotton, rice or soybean plants, particularly in Northern and Southern American countries, Asia and Australia. The term plant, as used herein, encompasses whole plants as well as parts of plants, such as leaves, stems, seeds, flowers or roots. Particularly preferred target insects for the ISP3 proteins of this invention are leptidopteran insect pests, such as Heliothis spp., Helicoverpa spp.t Spodopter; spp., Ostrinia spp., Pectinophora spp, Agrotis spp., Scirphophaga spp., Cnaphalocrocis spp., Sesamia spp, Chilo spp., Anticarsia spp., Pseudoplusia spp., Epinotia spp.. and Rachiplusia spp., preferably Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea, Helicoverpa armigera, Helicoverpa punctera, Ostrinia nubilalit Spodopter;* nugipeda Agrotis ipsilon, Pectinophora gossypielia, Scirphophagt incertuias, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis. Sesamia inferens, Chilo partellus.<br><br>
Anticarsia gemmatalis. Pseudoplusia includens, Epinotia aporema and Rachiplusia nu. The ISP3 proteins of the invention preferably have insecticidal activity against at least one lepidopteran insect species, more preferably against several Lepidopteran insect species.<br>
The terms "ISP3 protein", "ISP3 protein of this invention", "ISP protein", or "ISP protein of this invention", as used herein, refers to any one of the new proteins isolated in accordance with this invention and identified and defined herein as ISP3-1099E. ISP2-327D. or ISP3-2245J protein.<br>
An ISP3 protein, as used herein, can be a protein in the full length size or can be in a truncated form as long as the insecticidal activity is retained, or can be a combination of different proteins or protein domains in a hybrid or fusion protein. An "ISP3 toxin" refers to an insecticidal fragment or portion of an ISP3 protein, particularly the smallest toxic fragment thereof. An 'Vsp gene", "isp3 gene", "isp DNA" or i{isp3 DNA", as used herein, is a DNA sequence encoding an ISP3 protein in accordance with this invention, referring particularly to any of the isp3-1099E, isp3-327D or isp3-2245J DNA sequences defined above.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence, particularly DNA sequence, encoding the ISP3 proteins of this invention can be made synthetically and can be inserted in expression vectors to produce high amounts of ISP3 proteins. The ISP3 proteins can be used to prepare specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a conventional manner (Hofte et al., 1988; Harlow and Lane, 1988).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention antibodies that specifically bind to the ISP3 protein are provided. In particular, monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that bind to ISP3-1099E, ISP3-327D or ISP3-2245J, or to fragments or variants thereof are provided. Included are fragments of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies,<br>
which retain the ability tc bind to the ISP3 protein or fragment against which they were raisec An antibody to an ISP3 protein can be prepared by using the<br><br><br>
Antibodies: A laboratory Manual" (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1998), Tn Liddell and Cryer UA Practical Guide to Monoclonal Antibodies" (Wiley and Sons, 1991). The antibodies can be used to isolate, identify, characterize or purify the ISP3 protein to which it binds. For example, the antibody can be used to detect the ISP3 protein in a sample, by allowing antibody and protein to form an immunocomplex, and detecting the presence of the immunocomplex, for example through ELISA or immunoblots.<br>
In addition, immunoioc cal kits, useful for the detection of ISP3 proteins, protein fragments or epitopes m a sample are provided. Samples may be cells, cell supernatants, cell suspensions, and the like. Such kit comprises an antibody that binds to the ISP3 protein (or fragment thereof) and one or more immunodetection reagents.<br>
The antibodies can also be used to isolate insecticidal proteins with similar activity by for example ELISA (enzyme linked immunoassay) or Western blotting.  Monoclonal antibody lines with desired binding specificity can also be used to clone the DNA for the particular monoclonal antibody.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention PCR primers and/or probes and kits foi detecting the isp3-1099E, isp3-237D or isp3-2245J DNA sequences are provided. PCR primer pairs to amplify isp3 DNA from samples can be synthesized based on SEQ ID No. 1, SEQ ID No. 3 or SEQ ID No. 5, as known in the art (see Dieffenbach and Dveksler (1995) PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, and McPherson at al. (2000) PCR - Basics: From Background to Bench, First Edition, Springer Verlag, Germany). Likewise, DNA fragments of SEQ ID No. 1, SEQ ID No. 3 or SEQ ID No. 5 can be used as hybridization probes. An isp3 detection kit may comprise either isp3 specific primers or isp3 specific probes, and an associated protocol to use the primers or probe to detec: isp3 DNA in a sample. Such a detection ki may, for example be used to determine, whether a plant has been transformed <br><br>
Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, some amino acid be replaced by others without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein. Furthermore, some amino acids can be substituted by other equivalent amino acids without significantly changing, preferably without changing, the insecticidal activity of the protein, at least without changing the insecticidal activity of the protein in a negative way. For example conservative amino acid substitutions within ;ne categories basic (e.g. Arg, His, Lys), acidic (e.g. Asp, Glu). nonpolar (eg Ala. Val.Trp, Leu, lie, Pro, Met, Phe, Trp) or polar (e.g. Gly, Ser. Thr. Tyr, Cys Asn, G!n) fall within the scope of the invention as long as the insecticidal activity of the ISP3 protein is not significantly, preferably not. changed, at least nor changed in a negative way. In addition non-conservative amino acid substitutions fall within the scope of the invention as long as the insecticidal activity of the ISP3 protein is not changed significantly, preferably not, or at least is net changed in a negative way. Variants or equivalents of the DNA sequences of the invention include DNA sequences hybridizing to the isp3 DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 or SEQ ID No. 3 or SEQ ID No. 5 under stringent hybridization conditions and encoding a protein with the same insecticidal characteristics as the protein of this invention, or DNA sequences having a different codon usage compared to the native isp3 genes of this invention but which encode a protein with the same insecticidal activity and with substantially the same, preferably the same, amino acid sequence. The isp3 DNA sequences can be codon-optimized by adapting the codon usage to that most preferred in plant genes, particularly to genes native to the plant genus or species of interest (Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982; Itakura et al., 1977) using available codon usage tables (e.g. more adapted towards expression in cotton, soybean corn or rice). Codon usage tables for various plant species are published for example by Ikemura (1993) and Nakamura et al. (2000).<br>
Also long stretches of AT or GC nucleotides may be removed and suitable<br>
restriction sites-nay ce introduced.<br><br><br>
proteins of the'invention to be expressed in plants cells start with a Met-Asp or Met-Ala dipepttde for optimal translation initiation, requiring the insertion in the isp3 DNA of a codon encoding an Asp or Ala amino acid downstream of the start codon as a new second codon. Alternatively, the fourth nucleotide of SEQ ID No. 1. SEQ ID No. 3 or SEQ ID No. 5 may be replaced by a 'G\ so that the second amino acid (following Met) is Asp. Likewise, the second codon (AAC or AAT, coding for Asn) may be replaced by a codon for Asp (GAT or GAC) or Ale (GCTP GCC, GCA or GCG), or by any other codon starting with a 'GThe DNA sequences may aiso be modified to remove illegitimate splice sites As bacterial genes may contain motifs, which are recognised in other hosts, especially in eukaryotic host such as plants, as 5' or 3' splice sites, transcriptioi in those other hosts may be terminated prematurely, resulting in truncated mRNA. Illegitimate splice sites can be identified by computer based analysis ol the DNA sequences and/or by PCR analysis as known in the art.<br>
Of course, any DNA sequence differing in its codon usage but encoding the same protein or a similar protein with substantially the same insecticidal activit can be constructed, depending on the particular purpose. It has been describe in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems that changing the codon usage to that of the host cell is desired for gene expression in foreign hosts (Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982; Itakura et al., 1977). Codon usage tables are availab in the literature (Wada et al., 1990; Murray et alM 1989) and in the major DNA sequence databases (e.g. EMBL at Heidelberg, Germany) and as described b Nakamura et al (2000). Accordingly, synthetic DNA sequences can be constructed so that the same or substantially the same proteins are produced, is evident that several DNA sequences can be made once the amino acid sequence of the ISP3 proteins of this invention is known. Such other DNA sequences include synthetic or semi-synthetic DNA sequences that have beer changed in order ;o inactivate certain sites in the gene, e.g. by selectively inactivating certain cryptic regulatory or processing elements present in the native sequence as described in PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WO 93/09218, or by adapting tr.e overa.. codon usage to that of a more related ho:<br><br>
organism, preferably that of the host organism in which expression is aesirea. Several techniques for modifying the codon usage to that preferred by the host cells can be found in patent and scientific literature. The exact method of codon usage modification is not critical for this invention as long as most or all of the cryptic regulatory sequences or processing elements have been replaced by other sequences.<br>
Small modifications to a DNA sequence such as described above can be routinely made, i e., by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (Ho et al.,1989, White et al., 1989)   More profound modifications to a DNA sequence can be routinely done by de novo DNA synthesis of a desired coding region using available techniques.<br>
With the term "substantially the same", when referring to the amino acid sequence of an ISP3 protein, is meant to include an amino acid sequence that differs no more than 5 %, preferably no more than 2 %, from the amino acid sequence of the protein compared to; and when referring to toxicity of an ISP3 protein, is meant to include a protein whose mean LC50 value (which is the concentration of protein causing 50% mortality of the test population), calculated from three independent bioassays, carried out using the same bioassay-conditions, differs by no more than a factor 2 from the mean LC50 value obtained for the protein compared to (also calculated from three independent bioassays, carried out using the same bioassay-conditions as for the protein compared to). LC50 values are calculated with Probit analyis, using the program POLO PC (from LeOra Software, 1987, Berkely, California). It is understood, that 95% (or 90%) confidence limits (an associated parameter calculated with Probit analysis) are calculated for the LC50 values of each of the two proteins to be compared in order to determine whether a statistically significant difference in LC50 values exists. In general the toxicity of the two proteins is seen :o be substantially the same, if the confidence limits overlap and substantial different if the confidence limits do not overlap.<br><br>
The term "domain" of a ISP3 toxin (or ISP3 protein) as used herein means any part(s) or domain(s) of the toxin (or ISP3 protein) with a specific structure or function that can be transferred to another protein for providing a new hybrid protein with at least one functional characteristic (e.g., the binding and/or toxicity characteristics) of the ISP3 toxin (or ISP3 protein) of the invention (Ge et al., 1991). Such parts can form an essential feature of the hybrid protein with the binding and/or toxicity characteristics of the ISP3 proteins of this invention. Such a hybrid protein can have an enlarged host range, an improved toxicity and/or can be used in a strategy to prevent insect resistance development (EP 408 403; Visser et a!., 1993). DNA sequences encoding the domains are encompassed by this definition. A hybrid protein or fusion protein is used herein to mean a protein comprised of different protein domains, forming a functional, chimeric protein with the characteristics of the individual domains. Another domain which a hybrid or chimeric protein may, for example, comprise is a stabilising domain. Stabilising domains have for example been described to be present at the C-terminus of VIP3(a) proteins, and are thought to provide stability to the toxic protein in the gut-environment of susceptible insects.<br>
In addition to creating hybrid proteins, the function of specific domains can also be analyzed by the introduction of deletions of all or part of the domain(s) or the introduction of mutations into the domain, and analysis of the resulting effect on toxicity towards insects, protein stability, sensitivity to enzyme proteolysis, temperature changes, binding to DNA/proteins/specific cells, etc..<br>
It is an embodiment of the invention to provide a method of "evolving" a nucleic acid sequence encoding an ISP3 protein, particularly ISP3-1099E or ISP3-327D or ISP32245J, into a new nucleic acid sequence, which encodes a protein having insecticidal activity. The evolved nucleic acid sequence preferably has improved insecticidal activity compared to the non-evolved sequence. The term i      "evolving" as used ~are\n refers to a method of enhanced sequence evolution by recombination c; sequences, as described in US 5,811,238, WO97/20078 and US 6.130 406   ^corporared her;;-:- by reference. Nucleic acid "shuffling" is used herein to indicate in vitro or in vivo recombination between nucleic acid<br><br>
sequences of ji nucleic acid population or pool and can oe carneu uui  MIUWU in the art and as described in US 5,811,238, WO97/20078, US 6,180,406, US 6,117,679, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The method of evolving a nucleic acid sequence encoding an ISP3 protein comprises the following steos:<br>
(a)	providing a population of nucleic acid sequences encoding the amine acid<br>
sequences of SEC ID No. 2 and/or 4 and/or 6, or variants or fragments of the<br>
amino acid sequences of SEQ ID No. 2 and/or 4 and/or 6, wherein said variants<br>
or fragments have a sequence identity of at least 91% to-SEQ ID No. 2 or 4 and<br>
at least 88% to SEQ ID No 6<br>
(b)	shuffling said population of variants or fragments to form recombinant<br>
nucleic acid molecules<br>
(c) selecting or serening for recombinant nucleic acid molecules, which encode<br>
proteins that have insecticidal activity;<br>
repeating steps (a) to (c) with the recombinant nucleic acid molecules selected in step (c) until a -recombinant nucleic acid molecule has been found in step (c). wherein the protein encoded by said nucleic acid molecule has the desired insecticidal propeny.<br>
A non-evolved nucleic acid is a nucleic acid provided as starting material in step (a), while a corresponding evolved nucleic acid as used herein refers to a recombinant nucleic acid obtained in step (d) when carrying out the method using the non-evolved nucleic acid in step (a). Preferred nucleic acids used in step (a) are nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences ISP3-1099E (SEQ ID No. 2) and/or ISP3-327D (SEQ ID No. 4) and/or ISP3-2245J (SEQ ID No. 6) or variants or fragments thereof. The population of nucleic acid molecules and/or variants and/or fragments of nucleic acid molecules in step (a) may comprise the DNA encoding a single ISP3 protein and/or variants and/or fragments of the nucleic acid encoding a single ISP3 protein  <br>
94%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity at the amino acid level to SEQ ID No. 2. Nucleic acid sequences encoding variants of amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 4 are nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences which have at least 91%, preferably at least 92 or 93%, most preferably at least 94%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity at the amino acid level to SEQ ID No. 4. Nucleic acid sequences encoding variants of amino acid sequence SEQ ID No. 6 are nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences which have at least 88%, preferably at least 89 or 90%, most preferably at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 95%. 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity at the amino acid level to SEQ ID No. 6.<br>
An evolved nucleic acid sequence obtained in step (d) preferably encodes a protein with improved insecticidal activity, i.e. the protein has, for example, either higher toxicity than the protein encoded by the non-evolved sequences used in step (a) as starting material, or has activity against a different spectrum of target insects than the non-evolved sequences, or it binds to a different target binding site in a target insect. Selection or screening for the desired higher toxicity and/or different toxicity spectrum (step (c)) can be carried out by performing insect bioassays, comparing insecticidal activity of the proteins encoded by the evolved and non-evolved nucleic acid sequences. Alternative or additional other functional assays may be carried out, depending on the desired insecticidal property. For example, if enhanced binding is a desired property, a binding assay may be carried out prior to carrying out an insect bioassay.<br>
The isp3 DNA sequences of the invention, prepared from total DNA, can be ligated in suitable expression vectors and transformed in a bacterial strain, such as E. coli or a Bt strain, and the clones can then be screened by conventional<br>
colony immunoprobing methods (French et al., 1986) for expression of the toxin<br>
with monoclonal or oolyclonai antibodies raised against the ISP3 proteins.<br><br>
standard methods and standard western-blotting procedures can be carried out), or the bacteria can be tested for their insecticidal activity compared to the control bacteria. The clones can also be analysed for the presence of mRNA encoding ISP3 protein using standard PCR procedures, such as RT-PCR.<br>
The genes encoding the ISP3 proteins of this invention can be sequenced in a conventional manner (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980; Sanger, 1977) to obtain the DNA sequence. Sequence comparisons indicated that the genes are different from previously descrc-ed genes encoding toxins with activity against Lepidoptera.<br>
An insecticidally effeciive part of the DNA sequences, encoding an insecticidally effective portion of the newly identified ISP3 proteins, can be made in a conventional manner after sequence analysis of the gene. The amino acid sequence of the ISP3 proteins can be determined from the DNA sequence of the isolated DNA sequences. By "an insecticidally effective part (or portion or fragment)" of DNA sequences encoding the ISP3 protein, also referred to herein as "truncated gene' or "truncated DNA". is meant a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide which has fewer amino acids than the ISP3 full length protein form but which is insecticidal.<br>
In order to express all or an insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequence encoding an ISP3 protein of this invention in E. colt, in other Bt strains and in plants, suitable restriction sites can be introduced, flanking the DNA sequence. This can be done by site-directed mutagenesis, using well-known procedures (Stanssens et alM 1989; White et al., 1989).   In order to obtain improved expression in plants, the codon usage of the isp3 gene or insecticidally effective isp3 gene part of :his invention can be modified to form an equivalent, modified or artificial gene cr gene cart in accordance with PCT publications WO 91/16432 and WC 93/092*3 and publications EP 0 385 962, EP 0 359  <br>
For obtaining enhanced expression in monocot plants such as corn or nee, an intron, preferably a monocot intron, can also be added to the chimeric gene. For example the insertion of the intron of the maize Adh1 gene into the 5' regulatory region has been shown to enhance expression in maize (Callis et. al., 1987). Likewise, the HSP70 intron, as described in US 5,859,347, may be used to enhance expression. The DNA sequence of the isp3 gene or its insecticidal part can be further changed in a translationally neutral manner, to modify possibly inhibiting DNA seauences present in the gene part by means of site-directed intron insertion and/or by introducing changes to the codon usage, e.g., adapting the codon usage to that most preferred by plants, preferably the specific relevant plant genus (Murray et al., 1989), without changing significantly, preferably without changing, the encoded amino acid sequence.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, it is preferred that the proteins are targeted to intracellular organelles such as plastids, preferably chloroplasts, mitochondria, or are secreted from the cell, potentially optimizing protein stability and/or expression. For this purpose, in one embodiment of this invention, the chimeric genes of the invention comprise a coding region encoding a signal or target peptide, linked to the ISP3 protein coding region of the invention. Particularly preferred peptides to be included in the proteins of this invention are the transit peptides for chloroplast or other plastid targeting, especially duplicated transit peptide regions from plant genes whose gene product is targeted to the plastids, the optimized transit peptide of Capellades et al. (US 5,635,618), the transit peptide of ferredoxin-NADP+oxidoreductase from spinach (Oelmuller et al., 1993), the transit peptide described in Wong et al. (1992) and the targeting peptides in published PCT patent application WO 00/26371. Also preferred are peptides signalling secretion of "a protein linked to such peptide outside the cell, such as the secretion signal of the potato proteinase inhibitor II (Keil et al., 1986), the secretion signal of the alpha-amylase 3 gene cf rice (Sutliff et al.. 1991) and the secretion signal of tobacco PR1 protein (Cor~e!issen et aL 1985).<br><br>
Particularly useful signal peptides in accordance with the invention include the chloroplast transit peptide (e.g., Van Den Broeck et al.,1985), or the optimized chloroplast transit peptide of US 5,510,471 and US 5,635,618 causing transport-of the protein to the chloropiasts, a secretory signal peptide or a peptide targeting the protein to other plastids, mitochondria, the ER, or another organelle. Signal sequences for targeting to intracellular organelles or for secretion outside the plant cell or to the cell wall are found in naturally targeted or secreted proteins, preferably those described by Klosgen et al. (1989), Klosgen and Weii (1991), Neuhaus &amp; Rogers (1998), Bih et al. (1999), Morris et al. (1999), Hesse et al. (1989), Tavladoraki et al. (1998), Terashima et al. (1999), Park et al. (1997), Shcherban et al. (1995), all of which are incorporated herein by reference, particularly the signal peptide sequences from targeted or secreted proteins of corn, cotton, soybean or rice.<br>
fo allow secretion of the ISP3 proteins to the outside of the transformed host :ell, an appropriate secretion signal peptide may be fused to the amino terminal =nd (N-terminal end) of the ISP3 protein. Also, any putative native Bacillus secretion signal peptide can be deleted or can be replaced by an appropriate signal peptide, such as a eukaryotic secretion signal peptide as described above. Particularly, amino acids 1 to 54 of the ISP3 proteins of the invention comprise a putative Bacillus signal peptide. Amino acids 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 50, more preferably 1 to 54 may be removed from the ISP3 proteins or may be eplaced by an appropriate signal peptide, particularly a eukaryotic signal jeptide as described above. Putative signal peptides can be detected using ;omputer based analysis, using programs such as the program Signal Peptide earch (SignalP V1.1 or 2.0), using a matrix for prokaryotic gram-positive ►acteria and a threshold score of less than 0.5, especially a threshold score of i.25 or less (Von Heijne, Gunnar, 1986 and Nielsen et al.,1996).<br>
urthermore, the cinding properties of the ISP3 proteins of the invention can be valuated, using methods known in the art (e.g., Van Rie et al., 1990). to etermine if the :3D3 croters of the irvention bind to sites in the insect gut, uch as the midgut, that are not recognized {or competed for) by other 3t<br><br>
proteins. Insecticidal Bt proteins with different binding sites tor wnicn mere is r competition for binding in relevant susceptible insects are very valuable to replace known Bt proteins to which insects may have developed resistance, 01 to use in combination with insecticidal Bt proteins having a different mode of action to prevent or delay the development of insect resistance against Bt proteins, particularly when expressed in a plant. Because of the characteristic of the newly isolatec Bt toxins, they are extremely useful for transforming plan' e.g. monocots such as corn and rice and dicots such as cotton and soybean, t protect these plants from insect damage. It is expected that the binding properties of the ISP3 proteins of the current invention will be different compared to those of Cry toxins. Such different binding properties can be measured by routine binding assays as described above or in US 6,291,156 and US 6,137,033<br>
Especially for insect resistance management purposes for a specific insect it is preferred to combine an ISP3 protein of this invention with another insect control protein, particularly a Bt Cry protein or a VIP or VIP-like protein, preferably a protein which does not recognise at least one binding site recognised by such ISP3 protein. Preferred insect control proteins to combine with the ISP3 proteins of this invention, particularly for simultaneous expressio in plants, preferably maize, cotton, rice or soybean plants, include the Cry proteins, such as the CrylF protein or hybrids derived from a CrylF protein (e.g., the hybrid Cry1A-Cry1F proteins described in US 6,326,169; US 6,281,016; US 6,218,188, or toxic fragments thereof), the Cry1A-type proteins or toxic fragments thereof, preferably the Cry 1 Ac protein or hybrids derived fro the CrylAc protein (e.g., the hybrid Cry1Ab-Cry1Ac protein described in US 5,880,275) or the Cry1 Ab or Bt2 protein or insecticidal fragments thereof as described in EP451878, the Cry2AeT Cry2Af or Cry2Ag proteins as described i WO02/057664, the Cry proteins as described in WO01/47952, the VIP3Aa protein or a toxic fragment thereof as described in Estruch etal. (1996) and US 6,291,156. insecticdal proteins from Xenorhabdus (as described in WO98/50427), S'.
 <br>
WO98/08932-(e.g., Waterfield et al., 2001; Ffrench-Constant and Bowen, 2000). In one embodiment, such co-expression is easily obtained by transforming a plant already expressing an insect control protein with a ISP3 of this invention, or by crossing plants transformed with the insect control protein and plants transformed with one or more ISP proteins of this invention. For maize, rice, cotton or soybean plants, preferably the ISP3-327D protein or the ISP3-1099E protein or the ISP3-2245J protein is used as first insect control protein and as second insect control protein the CrylAb, CrylAc, Cry2Ae or VIP3Aa proteins or derivatives thereof are used. Methods for obtaining expression of different Bt (or similarly, for other insect control proteins) insecticidal proteins in the same plant in an effort to minimize or prevent resistance development to transgenic insect-resistant plants are described in EP 0 408 403. It is understood that the different proteins can be expressed in the same plant, or each can be expressed in a single plant and then combined in the same plant by crcssing the single plants with one another. For example, in hybrid seed production, each parent plant can express a single protein. Upon crossing the parent plants to produce hybrids, both proteins are combined in the hybrid plant.<br>
It is well known that Bt Cry proteins are expressed as protoxins, which are converted into the toxic core by proteolysis in the insect gut. When combining the ISP3 proteins of the invention with Bt Cry proteins, it is understood that Bt Cry genes either encoding the full protoxin or the toxic core or any intermediate form may be used.<br>
Preferably, for selection purposes but also for increasing the weed control options, the transgenic plants of the invention are also transformed with a DNA encoding a protein conferring resistance to a broad-spectrum herbicide, e.g.,<br>
herbicides based on glufosinate or glyphosate.<br>
The insecticidally effective :sp3 gene part or its equivalent, preferably the isp3 chimeric gene encoding a~ insecticidally effective portion of the ISP3 protein,<br><br>
conventional manner to produce a transformed plant that is insect-resistant. In this regard, a T-DNA vector, containing the insecticidally effective isp3 gene part, in Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be used to transform the plant cell, and .. thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using the procedures described, for example, in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application EPO 242 246 and in Gould et al. (1991). The construction of a T-DNA vector for Agrobacterium mediated plant transformation is well known in the art. The T-DNA vector may be either a binary vector as described in EP 0 120 561 and EP 0 120 515 or a co-integrate vector which can integrate into the Agrobacterium Ti-plasmid by homologous recombination, as described in EP 0 116 718. Preferred T-DNA vectors each contain a promoter operably linked to the insecticidally effective isp3 gene part between T-DNA border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence.  Border sequences are described in Gielen et al. (1984). Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for example in EP 0 223 247), pollen mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 270 356 and WO 85/01856), protoplast transformation as, for example, described in US 4,684,611, plant RNA virus-mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 067 553 and US 4,407,956), liposome-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US 4,536,475), and other methods such as the recently described methods for transforming certain lines of corn (e.g., US 6,140,553; Fromm etal., 1990; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990) and rice (Shimamoto et al., 1989; Datta et al. 1990) and the method for transforming monocots generally (PCT publication WO 92/09696). For cotton transformation, especially preferred is the method described in PCT patent publication WO 00/71733. For rice transformation, reference is made to the methods described in WO92/09696, WO94/00977 and WO95/06722.<br>

Besides transformation of the nuclear genome, also transformation of the plastid genome, preferably chloroplast genome, is included in the invention. Kota et al. (1999) have described a method to over-express a Cry2Aa protein in tobacco chloroplasts.<br>
The resulting transformec plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed plants with the same characteristics or to introduce the insecticidally effective isp3 gene part into other varieties of the same or related plant species. Seeds, which are obtained from the transformed plants, contain the insecticidally effective isp3 gene part as a stable genomic insert. Cells of the transformed plant can be cultured in a conventional manner to produce the insecticidally effective portion of the ISP3 toxin or protein, which can be recovered for use in conventional insecticide compositions against Lepidoptera (US 5,254,799).<br>
The insecticidally effective isp3 gene part is inserted in a plant cell genome so that the inserted gene is downstream (i.e., 3') of, and under the control of, a promoter which can direct the expression of the gene part in the plant cell. This is preferably accomplished by inserting the isp3 chimeric gene in the plant cell genome, particularly in the nuclear or plastid (e.g., chloroplast) genome.<br>
Preferred promoters include: the strong constitutive 35S promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al., 1981), CabbB-S (Franck et al., 1980) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987); the 35S promoter described by Odell et al. (1985), promoters from the ubiqui:;n family (e.g., the maize ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al., 1992. EPC 242 926. see also Cornejo etal., 1993), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al.. 1992). the e^u promoter (Last et al., 1990), Arabidopsis actin promoters .-.!/.- vs :---• .-: -:~-fer -~-zzribed by An et ai. (1996), nee actin promoters sucr as the pr~-noter described by Zhang et al. (1991) anc the<br><br>
promoter desGfibed in US 5,641,876; promoters of the Cassava vein mosaic virus (WO 97/48819, Verdaguer et al. (1998)), the pPLEX series of promoters from Subterranean Clover Stunt Virus (WO 96/06932, particularly the S7 promoter), a alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, e.g., pAdhlS (GenBank accession numbers X04049, X00581),and theTRV promoter and the TR2' promoter (the "TRV promoter" and ,TR2' promoter", respectively) which drive the expression of the 1' and 2' genes, respectively, of the T-DNA (Velten et al., 1984). Alternatively, a promoter can be utilized which is not constitutive but rather is specific for one or more tissues or organs of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or roots) whereby the inserted isp3 gene part is expressed only in cells of the specific tissue(s) or organ(s). For example, the insecticidally effective isp3 gene part could be selectively expressed in the leaves of a plant (e.g., corn, cotton, rice, soybean) by placing the insecticidally effective gene part under the control of a light-inducible promoter such as the promoter of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene of the plant itself or of another plant, such as pea, as disclosed in US 5,254,799. The promoter can, for example, be chosen so that the isp3 gene of the invention is only expressed in those tissues or cells on which the target insect pest feeds so that feeding by the susceptible target insect will result in reduced insect damage to the host plant, compared to plants which do not express the isp3 gene. A Lepidopteran insect pest mainly damaging the roots can thus effectively be controlled by expressing an isp3 gene under a root specific promoter. A promoter preferentially active in roots is described in WO00/29566. A preferred promoter for root preferential expression is the ZRP promoter (and modifications thereof) as described in US 5,633,363. Another alternative is to use a promoter whose expression is inducible, for example a wound-inducible promoter such as e.g. the MPI promoter described by Cordera et al. (1994), which is induced by wounding (such as caused by insect feeding), or a promoter inducible by a chemical, such as dexamethasone as described by Aoyama and Chua (1997) or a promoter inducible by temperature, such as the heat shock promoter described in US 5 447,353. or a promoter inducible by other external stimuli.<br><br>
The insecticidally effective isp3 gene part is inserted into the plant genome so that the inserted gene part is upstream (i.e., 5') of suitable 3' end transcription regulation signals (i.e., transcript formation and polyadenylation signals). This is preferably accomplished by inserting the isp3 chimeric gene in the plant cell genome. Preferred polyadenylation and transcript formation signals include those of the CaMV 35S gene, the nopaline synthase gene (Depicker et al., 1982), the octopine synthase gene (Gielen et al., 1984) and the T-DNA gene 7 (Velten and Scheil. 1985). which act as 3'-untranslated DNA sequences in transformed plant cells.<br>
Introduction of the T-DNA vector into Agrobacterium can be carried out using known methods, such as electroporation or triparental mating.<br>
The insecticidally effective isp3 gene part can optionally be inserted in the plant genome as a hybrid gene (US 5.254,799; Vaeck et al., 1987) under the control of the same promoter as a selectable or scorable marker gene, such as the neo gene (EP 0 242 236) encoding kanamycin resistance, so that the plant expresses a fusion protein which is easily detectable.<br>
Transformation of plant cells can also be used to produce the proteins of the invention in large amounts in plant cell cultures, e.g., to produce a ISP3 protein that can then be applied onto crops after proper formulation. When reference to a transgenic plant cell is made herein, this refers to a plant cell (or also a plant protoplast) as such in isolation or in tissue culture, or to a plant cell (or protoplast) contained in a plant or in a differentiated organ or tissue, and both possibilities are specifically included herein. Hence, a reference to a plant cell in the description or claims is not meant to refer only to isolated cells in culture, but refers to any plant cell, wherever it may be located or in whatever type of plant tissue or organ it may be present.<br>
All or part of the sp3 gene, encoding an anti-Lepidopteran protein, car also be<br>
used to trans'c.—' other ~. croorgar.sms, such as bacteria, such as a 5 thuringicr:&gt;is &gt;;/r :n has .rsecticiaa: activity against Lepidoptera or Cc eoptera<br><br>
Thereby, a transformed Bt strain can be produced which is useful for combating a wide spectrum of Lepidopteran and/or Coleopteran insect pests or for combating additional Lepidopteran insect pests. Transformation of bacteria, such as bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Bacillus or Escherichia, with all or part of the isp3 gene of this invention, incorporated in a suitable cloning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably using conventional electroporation techniques as described in Mahillon et al. (1989) and in PCT Patent publication WO 90/06999.<br>
Transformed Bacillus species strains containing the isp3 gene of this invention can be fermented by conventional methods (Dulmage, 1981; Bernhard and Utz, 1993) to provide high yields of cells. Under appropriate growth conditions which are well understood these strains secrete ISP3 proteins in high yields.<br>
Alternative suitable host microorganisms in which the isp3 genes can be expressed are fungi, algae, or viruses, particularly species which are plant colonising (e.g., (endo)symbiontic) species or insect pathogens.<br>
An insecticidal, particularly anti-Lepidopteran, composition of this invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using the microorganisms transformed with the isp3 gene, or preferably their respective ISP3 proteins or the ISP3 toxin, or an insecticidally effective toxin portion as an active ingredient, together with suitable carriers, diluents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants (e.g., as described by Bernhard and Utz( 1993). This insecticide composition can be formulated as a wettable powder, pellets, granules or dust or as a liquid formulation with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents as a foam, gel, suspension, concentrate, etc.. Examples of compositions comprising insecticidal Bt spores are described in WO96/10083.<br>
A method for compiling insects, particularly Lepidoptera, in accordance with this invention can comprise applying (e.g., spraying), to a locus (area) to be<br>
protected, nw 'ns-.-v z\6al amount of the ISP3 oroteins or compositions comprising the IS-'; proteins or comprising host cells transformed with the tsp3<br><br>
genes of this invention. The locus to be protected can include, for example, tne habitat of the insect pests or growing vegetation (e.g. application to the foliage) or an area where vegetation is to be grown (e.g. application to soil or water). A preferred composition comprises an insecticidal amount of at least one of the ISP3 proteins of the invention, preferentially produced by a bacterial host, and the preferred application of the composition are leaf application, soil application or seed coating.<br>
The term "contacting" is used herein to mean "to bring into physical contact with". Contacting a plant with an insecticidal protein means that the insecticidal protein is brought into contact with cells of the plant, either internally (for example by expression in the plant) or externally (for example by applying compositions comprising the insecticidal protein externally to the plant). It is understood that the term does not indicate the length of time of contact, but comprises any time period of contact (e.g. brief contact, long contact). When referring to a method of protecting a plant against insect damage comprising contacting said plant (or cells or tissues thereof) with an insecticidal protein of the invention, the contact is preferentially long enough and extensive enough (with a high enough amount of protein contacting a large enough number of cells) to prevent or reduce insect damage.<br>

To obtain the ISP3 toxin or protein, cells of the recombinant hosts expressing the ISP3 protein can be grown in a conventional manner on a suitable culture medium. The secreted toxin can be separated and purified from the growth medium. Alternatively, if the proteins are not secreted, the cells can be lysed using conventional means such as enzyme degradation or detergents or the like. The toxin can then be separated and purified by standard techniques sucY as chromatography, extraction, electrophoresis, or the like.<br>
The term "gene" means any DNA or RNA fragment comprising a region (the "transcribed region") which is transcribed into an RNA molecule (e.g., an mRNA) in a cell, operably linked to suitable regulatory regions, e.g., a plant-expressible promoter. A gene may thus comprise several operably linked fragments such as a promc'er a 5' leader sequence, a coding region, and a 3' nontranslated seo.ence  -Uprising s ooiyadenylatior. site A gene<br><br>
endogenous to a particular organism (such as a plant species or a oacienai strain) is a gerre, which is naturally found in that organism in nature. A chimeric gene, when referring to an isp3 DNA of this invention, refers to an isp3 DNA sequence having 5' and/or 3' regulatory sequences different from the naturally-occurring bacterial 5' and/or 3' regulatory sequences, which drive the expression of the isp3 gene in its native host cell.<br>
The term "expression of a gene" refers to the process wherein a DNA or RNA region which is operably linked to appropriate regulatory regions, particularly to a promoter, is transcribed into an RNA which is biologically active i.e., which is either capable of interaction with another nucleic acid or which is capable of being translated into a biologically active polypeptide or protein. A gene is said to encode an RNA when the end product of the expression of the gene is biologically active RNA, such as e.g. an antisense RNA, a ribozyme or a replicative intermeciate. A gene is said to encode a protein when the end product of the expression of the gene is a biologically active protein or polypeptide.<br>
For the purpose of :his invention the "sequence identity" of two related nucleotide or amino acid sequences, expressed as a percentage, refers to the number of positions in the two optimally aligned sequences which have identic; residues (x100) divided by the number of positions compared. A gap, i.e. a position in an alignment where a residue is present in one sequence but not in the other is regarded as a position with non-identical residues. To calculate sequence identity between two sequences for the purpose of this invention, the GAP program, which uses the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm (1970) and which is provided by the Wisconsin Package, Version 10.2, Genetics Compute Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wisconsin 53711. USA, is used. The GAP parameters used are a gap creation penalty = 50 (nucleotides) / 8 (amino acids), a gao extension penalty = 3 (nucleotides) / 2 (amino acids), and a scoring matrix "r.vsgapcna" (nucleotides) or"blosum62" (amino acids).<br><br>
GAP uses the_Needieman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm to align two sequences over their entire length, maximizing the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. The default parameters are a gap creation penalty = 50 (nucleotides) / 8 (proteins) and gap extension penalty = 3 (nucleotides) / 2 (proteins). For nucleotides the default scoring matrix used is "nwsgapdna" and for proteins the default scoring matrix is "blosum62M (Henikoff &amp; Henikoff, 1992).<br>

Samples<br>
Example 1: Characterization of bacterial strains<br>
A bacterial strain, named herein BTS01099E, was isolated from grain dust from Belgium. A further bacterial strain, named herein BTS00327D, was isolated from horse dung from Spain. A further bacterial strain, herein named BTS02245J, was isolated from grain dust from the Philippines.<br>
Each strain was grown overnight on LB agar plates (LB medium with 1.5 % agar added; LB medium:10 g/l trypton, 10 g/l NaCI, 5 g/l yeast extract, pH 7.3) at 28°C. For small scale cultures, 20 ml TB medium (Terrific Broth: 12 g/l tryptone, 24 g/l yeast extract, 3.8 g/l KH2P04, 12.5 g/l K2HP04, 5 ml/l glycerol, pH 7.1) was inoculated and grown for 65 hours at 28°C on a rotating platform having about 70 rotations per minute. After 65 hours, a protease inhibitor mixture was added to the culture. This cocktail has the following ingredients (volumes given are those required to add to one 20 ml culture): 200pl PMSF (100mM), 200^1 of a mixture of benzamidine.HCI (100mM) and epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid (500 mM), 400pl EGTA (0.5M), 40pl antipain (0.5mg/ml) / leupeptin (0.5mg/ml) and 20fjl beta-mercapto ethanol (14M).<br>
The culture medium to which the protease inhibitor mixture had been added, was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. In some cases, the supernatant was concentrated about 4 times using Centriprep YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore Cat. No. 4305).<br>
For long term storage, a loop of sporufated cells was added to 0.5ml of 25% glycerol and after vortexing, stored at -70°C. Sporulated cells were obtained by<br>
growth of the stra - on L3 agar plates until sporulation (as visible under the light microscope).<br><br>
After cultivating on LB agar plates of single cell colonies, microscopiucii <ancuy>K&gt; ui the strain cultures of BTS01099E, BTS00327D and BTS02245J showed the presence of rod-shaped, motile, single, vegetative cells and sporangia containing an ovale spore. Parasporal crystals were detected in cultures of BTS00327D, BTS01099EandBTS02245J.<br>
Based on the rod-like shape, the aerobic growth, and the presence of parasporal crystals, these 3 strains are believed to be B. thuringiensis species strains.<br>
Each strain can be cultivated on conventional standard media, preferably T3 medium (tryptone 3 g/l, tryptose 2 g/l, yeast extract 1.5 g/l, 5 mg MnCI2r 0.05 M Na2HP04.2H20, 0.05 M NaH2PO4.H20t pH 6.8 and 1.5% agar), preferably at 28 X.  For long term storage, it is preferred to mix an equal volume of a spore-crystal suspension with an equal volume of 50% glycerol and store this at -70 °C or lyophilize a spore-crystal suspension. For sporulation, growth on T3 medium is preferred for 72 hours at 28 °C.<br>

Bioassays were performed on neonate larvae of Helicoverpa zea} Heliothis virescens, Ostrinia nubilalis, Spodoptera frugiperda and Agrotis ipsilon.<br>
Cell-free supernatant of bacterial cultures of different Bacillus strains was used in insect bioassays ("surface contamination assay") against various lepidopteran insects.<br>
Strain BTS0109SE, BTS00327D or BTS02245J was grown at 28°C in TB medium. Cell-free culture supernatant was harvested 65 hours after culture initiation, dilutions were made and applied onto the surface of solidified artificial diet (agar 20g. water 1000ml. corn flour 96g, yeast 30g, wheat germs 54g,<br>

One neonate (L1; first instar) insect larvae was placed on each well and 18-20 larvae were used per sample. Dishes were kept at 25±13C and mortality rates (percentage dead versus living larvae) were recorded after 7 days. As a negative control standard diet and TB was used.<br>
Results (shown in Table 1 below) showed that the cell-free supernatants of strains BTS01099E. BTS00327D and BTS02245J showed toxicity towards Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea and Ostrinia nubilalis larvae. In addition, the supernatant of strain BTS02245J also showed toxicity towards Spodoptera frugiperda larvae and the supernatant of BTS00327D showed toxicity towards Agrotis ipsilon larvae.<br>

Cell-free supernatant of strain BTS02245J caused 11 % and 33% mortality of H. virescens larvae, 94% and 50% mortality of H. zea larvae, 50% mortality of O. nubilalis larvae and 78% mortality of S. frugiperda larvae, showing that supernatant of this strain has insecticidal activity, particularly against H, zea and S. frugiperda. Toxicity is likely caused by a protein secreted by this strain into the culture medium.<br>
The cell-free supernatant of strain BTS00327D caused 70% mortality of H. virescens larvae 35:: to 78co mortality of H. zea larvae, 100% mortality of O. nubilalis larvae and 100% mortality of Agrotis ipsilon larvae. Thus, the supernatant of this strain showed strong toxicity to at least four different species of Lepidopteran insects Toxicity is likely to be caused by an insecticidally active protein secreted by this strain into the culture medium.<br>
The cell-free supernatant of strain BTS01099E caused 25% mortality of H. virescens larvae. 10% mortality of H. zea larvae and 46% mortality of O. nubilalis larvae, indicating that the supernatant of this strain has toxic activity against different species of Lepidopteran insects. Toxicity is likely to be caused by an insecticidally active protein secreted by this strain into the culture medium.<br>
Example 3: Cloning of isp3 genes<br>
Cloning of the nucleotide sequence encoding ISP3-1099E from strain BTS01099E<br>
Total DNA of strain BTS01099E was prepared and partially digested with Sau3A. The digested DNA was size fractioned on a sucrose gradient. Fragments ranging from 7kb to 10kb were ligated to cloning vector pUC19l (a derivative of pUC19; Yannisch-Perron et al. 1985), after 8amH1 digestion and treatment of the cloning vector with TsAP (thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase). T-e ligaticr: mixture was then electroporated into E. cc//XL1-Blue  <br>
screened withVDIG labeled probe which was prepared as follows. First, a PCR was performed using as template cells from strain BTS01099E. The resulting amplification product was gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T. The resulting plasmid was used as template in a PCR reaction using DIG- labeled dNTPs and the same primers as in the first PCR reaction. An appropriate amount of this amplification product was used in hybridization reactions.<br>
Following the identification of a positive colony containing a plasmid harboring the full length isp3 gene, the sequence of this gene was determined using the dye terminator labeling method and a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism-377 DNA sequencer. Both the coding and non-coding strand were sequenced.<br>
The sequence of the open reading frame found in the cloned DNA fragment of a positive colony is shown in SEQ ID No. 1 {isp3-1099E). This DNA sequence was found to encode the novel protein shown in SEQ ID No. 2 (ISP3-1099E).<br>
To show that this DNA sequence is the cause of the insecticidal activity observed, the sequence was expressed in a bacterial strain and the supernatant or cell lysate of the recombinant strain was tested for insecticidal activity in insect bioassays.<br>

Both the coding and non-coding strand were sequenced.<br>
The sequence of the open reading frame found in the cloned DNA fragment of a positive colony is shown n SEQ ID No. 3 {isp3-327D). This DNA sequence was found to encode the novel protein shown in SEQ ID No. 4 (ISP3-327D1<br>
To show that this DNA sequence is the cause of the insecticidal activity observed, the sequence //as expressed in a bacterial strain and the supernatant or cell lysate of the recombinant strain was tested for insecticidal activity in insect oioassays.<br>
Cloning of the nucleotide sequence encoding ISP3-2245J from strain BTS02245J<br>
Total DNA of strain BTS02245J was prepared and partially digested with Sau3A. The digested DNA was size fractioned on a sucrose gradient. Fragments ranging from 7kb to 10kb were ligated to cloning vector pUC19l (a derivative of pUC19; Yannisch-Perron et al. 1985), after 8amH1 digestion and treatment of the cloning vector with TsAP (thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase). The ligation mixture was then electroporated into E. co//XL1-Blue cells. Transformants were plated on LB-triacillin plates containing X-gal and IPTG and v.-ne copies were selected to be used in filter hybridization experiments. Recombinant E. co//clones containing the vector were then screened with a 1-iG lace ed probe which v/as prepared as follows.  F '3t. a PCR was perfo""ed us —: as template cei.s from strain BTS02245J.   '~e<br><br>
resulting amplication product was gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T. The resulting plasmid was used as template in a PCR reaction using DIG- labeled dNTPs and the same primers as in the first PCR reaction. An appropriate amount of this amplification product was used in hybridization reactions.<br>
Following the identification of a positive colony containing a plasmid harborin the full length isp3 gene, the sequence of this gene was determined using the dye terminator labeling method and a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism-377 DNA sequencer. Both the coding and non-coding strand were sequenced.<br>
The sequence of the open reading frame found in the cloned DNA fragment of a positive colony is shown in SEQ ID No. 5 (isp3-2245J). This DNA sequence was found to encode the novel protein shown in SEQ ID No. 6 (ISP3-2245J).<br>
To show that this DNA sequence is the cause of the insecticidal activity observed, the sequence was expressed in a bacterial strain and the supernatant or cell lysate of the recombinant strain was tested for insecticidal activity in insect bioassays.<br>
Example 4: Recombinant expression of ISP3 proteins in E. coli<br>
SEQ ID No. 1 {isp3-1099E)t SEQ ID No. 3 {isp3-327D) and SEQ ID No. 5 (isp3-2245J) were subcloned into an expression vector, under control of the cryl Ab promoter, and expressed in E. coli strain WK6. During subcloning, an A/col restriction site was introduced at the ATG start codon, thereby changing the second amino acid of SEQ ID No 2, SEQ ID No 4 and SEQ ID No. 6 from Asparagine (Asn) into Aspartate (Asp).<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis of transformed E. coli cell lysates showed that proteins of<br>
the expected molecular weight (±88kDa) were produced for each of the three genes. As negative controls cell lysate of non-transformed E coli WK6 were<br>
used.<br><br>
Cell lysate of recombinant E. co//cultures, expressing isp3-327D and isp3-1099E, was used in insect bioassays (surface contamination assays) as described in Example 5. The results are summarized in Table 2 below. Plus symbols indicate significant insect mortality over the negative control.<br>

For ISP3-327D protein and ISP3-1099E protein, significant mortality was found in surface contamination assays with Helicoverpa zea% Heliothis virescens, Spodoptera frugiperda and Anticarsia gemmatalis. In addition, undiluted cell lysate of recombinant E. coli expressing ISP3-327D or ISP3-1099E showed significant mortality against Ostrinia nubilalis (50%(gi) mortality for ISP3-327D, 26% (gi) mortality for ISP3-1099E compared to 0% mortality for the control WK6).<br>
Example 5: Recombinant expression of ISP3 proteins in Bt<br><br>
SEQ ID No. ^'sp3-1099E) and SEQ ID No. 5 were subcloned into a shuttle vector and expressed in a crystal minus strain Bt strain (IPS 78/11 or Berliner 1715cry ~). In bioassays, supernatant from the non-transformed Bt strain is used as negative control.<br>
The cell-free culture supernatant from the recombinant Bt strain is tested for toxicity against Lepidopteran insect larvae, particularly against H. virescens, H. zea, H. armigera, 0 nubilalis, S. frugiperda, Agrotis ipsilon, Pectinophora gossypiella and A. gemmatalis, using a surface contamination assay as described above (Example 2) and below (to determine LC50 values).<br>
Supernatant from the recombinant Bt strain is obtained as follows. The Bt strain is grown overnight on LB agar plates containing erythromycin (20 Mg/ml) at 283C. For small scale cultures, 20 ml TB medium containing erythromycin (20 pg/ml) is inoculated and grown for 65 hours at 28°C on a rotating platform having about 70 rotations per minute. After 65 hours, a protease inhibitor mixture is added to the culture. This cocktail has the following ingredients (volumes given are those required to add to one 20 ml culture): 200pl PMSF (100mM), 200pl of a mixture of benzamidine.HCI (100mM) /epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid (500 mM), 400pl EGTA (0.5M), 40pl antipain (0.5 mg/ml) / leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml) and 20[jl beta-mercaptoethanol (14M).<br>
The culture medium to which the protease inhibitor mixture had been added, is then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. In some cases, the supernatant is concentrated about 4 times using centriprep YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Cat. No. 4305).<br>
For Helicoverpa zea and Heliothis virescens the following artificial diet is used in<br>
the surface contamination assay: water 1 liter, agar 20g, soyflour 81g. wheat germ 36g, Wesson salt mix 10g, sucrose 14.7g. Nipagin 1g, sorbic acid 1.1g, Vanderzant vit.mix 9.5g corn oil 5m! Nystatin 0.06g, Aureomycin 0.17g.<br><br>
In the surface_contamination assays for other lepidopteran insects, the Toiiowing artificial diet is"used: water 1 liter, agar, 20g, corn flour 112g, wheatgerm 28g, yeast 30g, sorbic acid 1.2g, Nipagin tg, Aureomycin 0.06gr Nystatin 0.03g, ascorbic acid 4.8g.<br>
The artifical diet is dispensed in wells of Costar 24-multiwell plates and allowed to solidify. 50JJI of diluted supernatant is applied onto the surface of each well (2cm2). One or two neonate (L1: first instar) larvae are placed on each well (depending on the spec es, e.g. fcr 0. nubilalis 2 larvae/well) and around 20 to 24 larvae are used per supernatant dilution, Six to eight supernatant dilutions (the dilution factor is arcund 3), ranging from about 4050 to 0.21 ng/cm2 are tested. Dishes are kept at 25 ±1 JC and mortality rates (percentage dead versus living larvae) are recorced after 7 days. As a negative control standard diet and TB is used. LC50 values and/or LC90 values are calculated with probit analyis using the program POLO PC (from LeOra Software, 1987, Berkeiy, California). The LC50 value is the total supernatant protein concentration when 50% of the tested insect larvae are killed.<br>
The bioassays show that the proteins encoded by the cloned sequences isp3-1099E and isp3-2245J each cause significant insecticidal activity against selected Lepidopteran -sects.<br>
SEQ ID No. 3 {isp3-327D) was subcloned into a shuttle vector and expressed in the crystal minus Bt strain IPS78/11. In bioassays, supernatant from the non-transformed Bt strain was used as negative control.<br>
SDS-page analysis showed that the culture supernatant contained a protein with a molecular weight close to the calculated molecular weight of the ISP3-<br>
327D protein (-38kDa)<br>
Using the surface contamination assay as described in Example 2, the cell-free<br>
showed significant insecticidal activity against Ostn'nia nubilalis (On), Pectinophora gossypiella (Pg) and Helicoverpa zea (Hz)} as shown in Table 3.<br>

Bioassays:<br>
Surface contamination assays, as described above, using concentrated supernatant after 26hrs culture in TB and following addition of protease inhibitor coctail. Heliothis artificial diet (as above) was used for H. zea and littoralis artificial diet for 0. nubilalis and P. gossypiella. For H. zea and O. nubilalis 48 well Costar plates, 25pl/well (1cm2), 18 wells with one L1 larva per well, were used. For P. gossypiella 24 well Costar plates, 50pl/well (2cm2) and 12 wells with two L1 larvae per well were used. Dvv artificial diet (as above) was used for Dvv in 24 well plates, 50pl/well (2cm2), 6 wells with 4 L1/well.<br>
The bioassay showed that the protein encoded by the cloned sequence isp3-327D has significant insecticidal activity against selected Lepidopteran insects.<br>
Example 6: further characterisation of ISP3-327D<br>
Supernatant from the crystal minus Bt strain IPS78/11 expressing SEQ ID No. 3 {isp3-327D) was used to test trypsin digestability of ISP3-327D protein and toxicity of the resulting fragments. Trypsin treatment of supernatant of the transformed IPS78/11 culture resulted in two major bands of about 65kDa and about 23kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis.<br>
Both trypsin treated supernatant (4 hours treatment; reaction was stopped with PMSF of a final cc^ertration of 0 ImM) and non-trypsin treated supernatant were used in surface contamination assays against Helicoverpa zea. The<br><br>
surface contamination assay was penormea on heiiotnis rooa in to niuu.»w.. plates (25pl/well; 1cm2). Six supernatant dilutions were tested. Per dilution 18 wells and one L1 larva per well were used. Mortality was scored after incubation at25°±1 °C after 7 days.<br>
LC50 values for the untreated and trypsin treated ISP3-327D protein showed overlapping 90% confidence intervals, showing that the trypsin treated protein retains toxic activity against H. zea.<br>
Example 7: Rice insect bioassays of recombinant ISP3 proteins<br>
The sequences for isp3-1099E (SEQ ID No. 1), isp3-327D (SEQ ID NO.3) and isp3-2245J (SEQ ID No. 5) were expressed in E. coli as described above.<br>
Cell lysates of recombinant E. coli were tested in insect bioassays for activity against four Lepidopteran rice pests. Five to six doses per protein were tested.<br>
(a) Yellow Stem Borer {Scirphophaga incertulas) bioassay: Yellow Stem Borer adults were collected from rice fields. Eggs laid by the adults were collected and kept in Petri dishes for hatching at 30°C. The newly hatched larvae were used in the bioassays.<br>
Rice stalk sheath of 6 cm were used. Six centimeter long segments of the leaf sheaths were cut from freshly excised rice stalks of the susceptible variety TN1. The inner most part of the segment, along with one sheath cover, were separately dipped into the different protein doses for 30 seconds. The treated stalk sheath was immobilized vertically on 2 cm agar gel in specimen tubes (7cm long; 2.5 cm diameter). 10-15 neonate larvae of Yellow Stem Borer were added to each treated stalk and tubes were sealed and incubated for five days. After 5 days, the numbers of surviving and of dead larvae were counted.<br>
(b) Leaffolder {Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) bioassay:<br>
Insects were directed from rice fields in northern India. Insect larvae were<br>
house. Emerging adults were confined in<br><br>
oviposition chamber and oviposited plants were kept in water trays for larval hatching. One day old larvae were used in bioassays.<br>
Bioassays were conducted in cylindrical chambers, using freshly excised leaves from rice plants at tillering stage. An 8 cm long leaf lamina was excised from the central whorl of the rice tiller. The leaf lamina was placed in the chamber and the different protein dosages applied. After 30 minutes, five to ten larvae were added per leaf. At least three leaves were used per protein dose. Five days after incubation, the number of dead and surviving larvae was counted.<br>
(c) Pink Stem Borer (Sesamia inferens) bioassay:<br>
Insects were collected from rice fields in northern India and reared on rice plants.<br>
Bioassays were conducted in glass vials (7.5cm x 2.5cm diameter) using an artificial diet made of dry bean powder, brewers yeast, sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, methyl paraben, agar and water. The diet was dispensed into the vials up to 2cm depth. At least three vials were prepared per protein dose. 40pl of test dose was spread uniformly onto the surface of the diet in each vial and left to dry for one hour. Ten to fifteen first instar larvae of Pink Stem Borer were added per vial. After seven days the number of dead and surviving larvae was counted.<br>
(d)	Corn Spotted Stem Boter (Chilo partellus) bioassays:<br>
Insects were maintained on artificial diet made up of red bean powder, brewers yeast, sorbic acid, sorghum leaf powder, ascorbic acid, methyl para-hydroxy benzoic acid, vitamins, wheat germ oil, Wesson salt mixture, agar, formaldehyde and water. Neonate larvae from these cultures were used in the bioassays. The bioassays were performed as described for Pink Stem Borer {Sesamia inferens).<br>
(e)	Results of rice insect bioassays<br>
The results of the insect bioassays, summarized in table 4 below, showed that ISP3-327D and IS^3-^:99E v/ere highly iox\z to four Leptidopteran rice pests, namely Yellow Stem Borer (Scirphophaga mcertulas), Leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). Pink Stem Borer (Sesamia inferens) and Corn<br><br>
Spotted StemlB'orer (Chilo partellus). Further, ISP3-2245J protein showed significant toxicity towards three lepidopteran rice pests, namely Yellow Stem Borer (Scirphophaga incertulas), Leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and Pink Stem Borer (Sesamia inferens), while no toxicity of ISP3-2245J protein against Corn Spotted Stem Borer {Chilo partellus) was detected.<br>

Example 8: Production of ISP3 proteins in transformed plants<br>
Plant expression vectors are constructed comprising a plant-expressible promoter, operably linked to a DNA sequence encoding either ISP3-1099E. ISP3-327D or ISP3-2245J (or a toxic fragment or variant thereof), and a 3' polyadenylation signal. A leader sequence, such as that from the chlorophyl a/b binding protein gene from Petunia (Harpster et al. 1988), is inserted 5' of the isp3 DNA. Preferably, codon-usage of isp3-1099E, isp3-327D and isp3-2245J is adapted to that of the host plant (e.g. corn, cotton or rice), for example as described in W094/24264.<br>
The promoters used to drive the isp3 genes are selected from the constitutive promoters CaMV 35S (Hull and Howell, 1987), maize ubiquitin promoter, rice actin promoter and Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus promoter. As 3' transcript<br>
termination and colyaderylation signal the 3'35S, 3'nos (Depicker et al. 1982). 3'ocs or 3'gene7 are used. For Agrobactenum mediated transformation, the<br>
expression casse-te is "erted into a T-DN- vector, between the right and left<br>
borclui vjanc:'<br><br>
Transformation of corn {/.ea mays), cotton {(Bossypium mrsuwm ui uuzoyvium barbadense) and rice (Oryza sativa) plants.<br>
Corn cells are stably transformed by Agrobacten'um mediated transformation as described in US 6,140,553, incorporated herein by reference. Cotton cells are stably transformed by Agrobacterium mediated transformation as described in WO 00/71733, incorporated herein by reference. Rice cells are stably transformed as described in WO92/09696.<br>
Transformed cells and plantlets are regenerated as described in the above references. For constructs additionally comprising a selectable marker gene, such as a herbicide resistance gene, for example 2mEPSPS (EPO 508 909 and EP 0 507 698 incorporated by reference) conferring resistance to glyphosate or the bar or PAT gene conferring resistance to glufosinate ammonium (EP 0 242 236 and EP 0 242 246 incorporated by reference) transformed cells are grown on selection media containing the selective agent, so that most of the selected regenerants are transformed.<br>
From the regenerants transformants expressing the isp3 gene are selected by ELISA, Southern blot, Northern blot and/or PCR analysis. Transformation events, particularly single copy events, are then selected for insecticidal activity towards Lepidopteran insect pests (using bioassays). Chimeric isp3-1099E, isp3-327D or isp3-2245Jgene-containing progeny plants show improved resistance to lepidopteran insects compared to non-transformed control plants. Particularly plants with high levels of insect tolerance express a high level of ISP3 protein and isp3 mRNA.<br>
Transformants are further selected for agronomic characteristics (normal phenotype, yield, plant architecture, etc.). Following seed increases, field trials<br>
of transformed corr cotton or rice plants are carried out in different regions where susceptible r.sect pests are present, demonstrating that plants expressing ISP3 p-.:e:rs have an increased insect tolerance under field conditions in different en;ironments. Particularly, following infestation (artificial<br><br>
or natural) of The field by insect pests, yield losses of the transrormea piams are reduced compared to non-transformed control plants.<br>
To generate plants with broad insecticidal activity, the ISP3 expressing events are crossed to each other and to other transgenic plants, expressing insecticidal proteins with a different, preferably complementary, insecticidal spectrum. Progeny of the crosses are assayed for insecticidal activity using bioassays for a range of different insect pests. Plants with insecticidal activity against the desired insect range are generated in this way.<br>
This invention is not limited to the above corn, cotton, soybean or rice plants, transformation methods, vector constructs (promoters, 3'ends, etc.) or the particular ISP3 crotems or DNA sequences used. The invention includes variants or equivalents of the ISP3 proteins retaining insecticidal activity.<br>
