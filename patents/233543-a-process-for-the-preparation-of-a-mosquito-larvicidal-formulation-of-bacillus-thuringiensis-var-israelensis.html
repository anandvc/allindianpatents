				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a mosquito larvicidal -formulation of bacillus thuringiensia var. israelensis.<br>
Bacillus thuringi ensis var. israel ensis is a known bacterial strain and processes for the preparation thereof are known in the art. However, such known processes  produced the aforesaid bacterial strain which<br>
*<br>
did     not     possess     suitable   level      of     activity     against mosqui to   1 arvae.<br>
An  ob:iect   of   this  invention   is  tD  propose     an improved     process     far      the preparation     of     a     mosquito larvicidal      formulation   of   bacillus     thuringi ensis     var, Israel ensis       having       suitable     level        of        larvicidal<br>
activity-<br>
A further ofoiect of this invention is to propose a process for preparing a slow-release floating formulation of bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis to serve as a moire efficient agent for destroying mosquito larvae.<br>
At the outset of the description follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However,  such  a particular form is only  an  exemplary<br>
embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching o-f the invention and not intended to be taken restrictivety.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process -for the preparation of a mosquito larvicidal formulation from bacillus thuringiensis ver israelensis comprising preparing an inoculum from a seed of bacillus thuringiensis ver. israelensis in at leant three stages, subjecting said inoculum to the step of fermentation, harvesting the cell mass obtained from said fermentation, spray drying and formulating said cell mass, said formulation/mixture being subjection to the step of extrusion, curing and drying to obtain bacillus thuringiensis ver . israelensis having mosquito larvicidal properties.<br>
In accordance with this invention comprises in subjecting a seed of bacillus thuringiensis ver. israelensis bacterial strain to the step o-f population growth. Preferably but without implying any limitations thereto, the step o-f population growth is effected in three stages.   In  the first stage the  seed  of -said<br><br>
bacterial strain is suspended in a medium at a pH 7.0-7.5 for a period of 6-8 hour to obtain a culture. fhe culture is transferred to fresh nutrient media having constituents similar to the medium of the first stage in atleast a further two stages for each a period of 6—8 hour to obtain an inoculum. The inoculum so obtained is subjected to the step of fermentation in a nutrient medium containing soyaflour, peanut oil and sterile water at a pH of 7.0—7.2 and for a period so as to obtain a cell mass, The said cell mass is harvested by precipitating with hydrochloric acid. The supernatant is discarded and the precipitated cell mass is then spray-dried and formulated.<br>
The step of formulation consists in a first step of mixing cell mass with sodium alginate, said mixture is diluted with water, extruded as granules into calcium chloride solution and said granules allowed to cure. The granules are then dried and packed in perforated sachets with polystyrene beads.<br>
ft process for the preparation of a mosquito larvicidal formulation of bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis according to a ' preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings whereins —<br>
Fig.l      shows the flow chart of the process.<br>
The process proposed by the present invention and as shown in the flow of chart of fig.l comprises transferring the seed/spores of the strain, obtained from the lyophiiized seed lot, into a test tuba having 8-12ml of seed medium and sterile water maintained at a pH between 7.0-7,5 to allow the growth at a temperature of 29 to 32°C for 6-8 hr. at the shaking speed of 225-275 r,p.m. to obtain a culture.<br>
The seed medium comprises 8-8—1.27. peptone, 0.8-1.27. yeast extract, 0,3-0.77. glucose, 0.8-1.27. salt Solution and sterile water having pH 7-7.5. The salt solution comprises 1.37. calcium chloride, 17. magnesium chloride, 0.287. manganese sulfate, 0.5% zinc sulfate, 0.01% ferrous sulfate, 0.01% copper sulfate, 0.037. sodium chloride in 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid.<br>
The grown culture so obtained is transferred into a conical flask having 80-I20mi preferably 100ml of seed medium as herein described above and sterile water at a pH 7.0—7.5 to grow the culture at 28~32°C for 6-8 hour and at a stiring/shaking speed of 225-275 r.p.m. preferably 250 r.p.m.<br>
Again the grown culture so obtained is transferred   into another  conical flask  having  1Q00—<br><br>
2200ml preferably 2080ml of seed medium as mentioned hereinabove and sterile water at a pH 7-7.5 so as to all the growth of the culture at a temperature 28-32°C -for 6-8  hr.   at   225-275  r.p.m.   stiring/shaking  speed.<br>
The grown culture so obtained is then transferred into a tomenter/bioreactor having. 55-65 litre o-f production medium containing, 2.5% soyaflour or 1.57. Jaggery, 0.57. yeast extract, 0.01% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.05% magnesium sulfate, 0.3% sodium chloride 0.01% ferrous sulfate, 0.5% peptone or 0.5% corn steep liquor and 1% salt solution and 0.1% peanut oil and sterile water at a pH of 7—7.5 to allow the culture growth at a temperature 28-32°C for 24-30 hr.   at   200-250 r.p.m-   and with  30-50% dissolved oxygen.<br>
The growth up ceilmass so obtained is then harvested from the above culture either by continuous centrifugation at 25000-30000 r.p.m. or by precipitation with 5 N hydrochloric acid or 0.8% potassium aluminium sulfate. The cellmass is resuapended with sterile water at the ratio of 2s 100 and is then spray dried with inlet temperature at 170-200°C and outlet temperature 70-80°C. The dried cellmass is mixed with 3~8% solution of sodium alginate in water in the ratio of l:l weight/volume. The     mixture     is  then  diluted  three  times     with     sterile<br>
water.	the pH   is   adjusted     to  6-5-7.       Ihe     mixture     ia<br>
then extruded into granules in 0.2 M calcium chloride solution and is subjected to the step of curing for 3—6 hr. The cured granules are dried at a temperature 30— 40°C for 24-28 hr and the dried granules so obtained are then packed in perforated sachets aiongwith polystyrene bends  at  the ratio  of   100:1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
