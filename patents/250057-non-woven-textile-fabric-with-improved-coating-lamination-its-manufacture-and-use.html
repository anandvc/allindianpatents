Non-woven textile fabric with improved coating/lamination, its manufacture<br>
and use.<br>
The following invention relates to non-woven textile fabric, which are especially suitable for us as in-lays or lining material, and which exemplify themselves through improved characteristics of application technology and through improved processability, The following invention also relates to their manufacture and application as in-lays for textiles.<br>
It  known that for in-laySor lining material different thermo-plasts can be applied as adfiesive medium for the hot-bonding/thermo-pasting.     Customarily,  co-<br>
characteristics of lining materials are known from the state-of-the-art of Technology.<br>
The Patent Document US-A-3,893,883 describes non-woven textile fabrics coated with hot-melt adhesives, in which as the hot-melt adhesive a compound made of a chosen polyethylene and a terpene resin is used.<br><br>
In Patent Document EP-A-110,454 lining materials with improved adhesive property and withstandability, under chemical washing processes are described, which are characterized through the application of chosen polyethylene with very narrow distribution of the molecular weight, higher density and chosen Melt-Flow-Index (MFI).<br>
For the purpose of improvement in changes of holding and adhesive coefficients within a broad processing scope and for presenting a uniformly fixing conditions for a large number of upper material, the non-woven textile fabrics are already developed with at least two superposed grid shaped coatings from hot-stamping adhesives of diverse qualities of adhesiveness. Such non-woven fabrics are described in the Patent Document DE-A-22 142 236 and DE-A-23 51 405. In the earlier known non-woven fabrics, already adhesives made of different polymers were used. This well known "double dot/point process" has proven itself since years in the actual manufacturing practice for the manufacture and practice of inlays and lining materials.<br>
Necessitated through the different molecular structure of the polymers, these differ themselves in their physical and chemical properties such as for instance, melt point, viscosity and stability against solvents such as suds and chemical detergents. In this context, however these parameters play a decisive role in the selection of the polymers for the application area of the lining.<br>
Therefore for instance in the area of linings for shirts where the washing conditions up to 95°C must be retained, typically polyethylene of higher density (hereinafter referred to as "HDPE") is applied as the hot stamping adhesive. This polymer has a higher melting range for instance from about 130°C and a lower MFI-value (melt index or melt flow index) of 10-20 g/10 minutes (190°C / 2,16 kg load). In this context what is disadvantageous is through the higher melting range and higher viscosity (corresponding to a lower MFI-value) of the polymer,<br><br>
fixing temperatures larger than 140°C are necessary. Furthermore for achieving an adequate adhesive effect, very large quantity of HOPE are required.<br>
Specially for application in highly wash-resistant and for very high conditions with regard to dry applications, the melt adhesive polymers which are today available in the market are not adequately suitable.<br>
Copolyamide, copolyester, polyethylene of lower density (LDPE) in melt range of 100 to 125°C with MFI-values of 2-70 g/10 minutes (140X/2,16 load) result in no acceptable adhesion strength coefficient after several handlings for necessary care of the fabric.<br>
Even HOPE in melting range of about 130°C and a lower MFI-value of 2-20g/10 minutes (190°C/2,16 kg load), for this application with high volumes of course result in adequately good adhesion strength but for the drying processes for instance in tunnel finisher, blister development and delamination of the pasted/laminated layers occur. The high mechanical stress through the severely moved, hot air and the steam addition result in extreme stresses for the lamination layer applied.<br>
Proceeding from this state-of-the-art of technology, the objective of the following invention is to make available non-woven textile fabric equipped with pressure sensitive adhesives, which can be processed without any problem using the customarily available fixing presses, and which demonstrate a very good wash withstandability up to 95°C and are also capable of withstanding extreme drying conditions under large number of cycles.<br>
The objective of the following invention is in providing non-woven textile fabrics equipped with hot sealing adhesives, which during their processing under the conditions of standardized tests for heavy requirement of wash withstandability with subsequent high drying conditions do not have the known disadvantages of<br><br>
the state-of-the-art of technology, withstand washing cycles of minimum 50 cycles and in so doing do not suffer under the known disadvantages such as "colour pickup" and loss of adhesiveness.<br>
The following invention relates to a textile non-woven fabric with a coating of two layers lying one over the other made of thermoplastics hot-seating adhesive of different composition, where the second hot sealing adhesive applied on the first hot sealing adhesive has a melting point greater than 135°C and a melt-flow-index (MFI)-value of 50 to 250 g/10 mins (190X72,16 kg).<br>
Advantageously the non-woven textile fabric with a coating of hot sealing adhesive is one in which the hot sealing adhesive applied for the creation of the second layer has the melting point &gt; 145°C and a MFI value of 50 to 200 g/10 minutes (190°C/2,16 kg).<br>
Especially desirable is a textile non-woven fabric in which the hot sealing adhesive applied for the purpose of creating the second layer has a melting point &gt; 150°C and a MFI value of 50 to 150 g/mins (190°C, 2,16 kg).<br>
Further, preferred is a textile non-woven fabric with a coating of hot sealing adhesive in which the second hot sealing adhesive is one based on the basis of polyolefin, polyurethane, polyester or polyamide.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric is further one in which the second hot sealing adhesive is an adhesive made on the basis of a polyurethane.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric is ideally that in which the second hot sealing adhesive is on the basis of a polypropylene which contains a co-polyester with melting point &gt; 145°C and MFI &gt; 60g/10 min (190°C/2,16 kg) in the ratio of 2-98 weight percentage.<br><br>
Especially ideal is a textile non-woven fabric in which the second hot sealing adhesive is on the basis of polypropylene which contains a co-polyester with a melting point of &gt;160°C and a MFI &gt; 140g/10 mins (190X72,16 kg) in the ratio of 2-98 weight percentage.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric is more ideally one in which the first hot sealing adhesive is made on the basis of a cross-linking or a thermoplastic polymers.<br>
Especially preferred is a textile non-woven fabric in which the first hot sealing adhesive possesses a MFI of &gt; 10g710 mins (190X72,16 kg).<br>
More ideally a textile non-woven fabric is one in which the first hot sealing adhesive possesses a MFI in the range from &gt; 20 g710 mins (190X72,16 kg) to 200 g710 mins (190X72,16 kg).<br>
The textile non-woven fabric is advantageously one in which the first hot sealing adhesive is one based on a polyolefin, polyamide and/or a polyester.<br>
An especially advantageous textile non-woven fabric is one in which the first hot sealing adhesive is based on a polypropylene.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric is ideally one in which the ratio of the mass of the first and second hot sealing adhesive is 2:1 to 1:3.<br>
Also high melting co-polyester and co-polyamide with melting point &gt; 145°C and a MFI of &gt; 60g710 mins (190X72,16 kg) could be applied for the second layer.<br><br>
Surprisingly it was found that through application of pressure sensitive adhesives with chosen melting viscosities and in combination with the well known double point process for applying the hot sealing adhesive, an interlining/lining could be represented with a hot sealing adhesive based on polyolefins, in which the temperatures above 155°C on upper materials could be well fixed, and which even thereafter could withstand minimum 25 over 50 cycles the test conditions according to ISO 15797:2004 "Industrial Wash and Finishing Processes for Testing of Work Wear/Uniform " and/or Washing Conditions up to 95X, as well as show no "colour pickup" in application.<br>
Further it was surprisingly observed that despite comparably higher MFI values the polymers applied no puncture of the hot sealed adhesive through the upper materials and reverse latching during sandwich fixing between the layers could be found.<br>
Further it was found with surprise that the polymers described above could already record very good test results and higher cycle numbers than standard polymers in single layer application with the use of localized pressure of the dispersion paste or through application of the polymers with the use of engraving rollers (powder point process).<br>
The invention based textile non woven fabric modified with pressure-sensitive adhesives can be manufactured based on all surface-creating techniques. Examples for this are weaving, laying, knitting, circular knitting or wet or dry fleece manufacturing processes.<br>
Under the definition "textile non-woven fabric", under the framework of this description, the following are to be included: Fabric, knitted fabric, circular knitted fabric or especially fleece material.<br><br>
Typically, the invention-based textile no-woven fabrics, especially the fleece materials have a surface weight of 10 to 500 g/m^.<br>
Especially preferred textile non-woven fabrics with surface weights of 30 to 200 g/m^ come to be applied.<br>
The invention-based textile non-woven fabric could be fixed or compacted in methods that are already known especially through mechanical or hydrodynamic needles, through melting of binding fibres available in the non-woven textile fabric, through thermo-mechanical fixing or through application of binding materials.<br>
After the manufacture of the textile non-woven fabrics, they are equipped with two layers of different hot sealing adhesives using methods which are already known, preferably though in accordance with the "double point process".<br>
Adhesives preferably based on polyolefin with the ranges defined above of the melting indices (MFI values) are used as the hot sealing adhesives.<br>
Under the framework of this description, with regard to the melting index, the MFI value is to be understood as the value ascertained according to DIN 53735:1980-10oraslSO1133.<br>
The definition polyolefin encompasses, besides alpha olefins, preferably also propylene or ethylene, derived homo polymers and also copolymers, which contain, besides structural units derived from one alpha olefins, also other structural units of ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons, for instance, additional alpha olefins and/or vinyl aromates such as styrol.<br><br>
Examples for the alpha olefins are ethylene, Prop-1-en, But-1-en, Pent-1-en, Hex-1-en, Oct-1-en, Dec-1.en.<br>
All types of known polyolefins can be applied. Examples for this are polyolefins, manufactured according to Ziegler-Natta Processes or under application of Metallocen-Catalyzers.<br>
Examples for preferably used polyolefins are polyethylene, polypropylene or copolymers derived from ethylene and propylene. Further examples are copolymers derived from ethylenes or from propylenes with additional alpha olefins of higher carbon number, such as But-1-en, Pent-1-en, Hex-1-en, Oct-1-en or Dec-1-en.<br>
One or both the layers of hot sealing adhesives could contain also a modified polyolefin, besides the respective polyolefin (compound). Under this, what is to be understood is a copolymer which is derived from at least one alpha olefin, and an ethylenically unsaturated acid or its unhydride or an ethylenically unsaturated epoxide combination or a compound of two or more of these co-monomers. In this context, the modification can take place in any optional manner for instance as copolymerization of alpha-olefin monomers together with selected co-monomers and/or as grafting of selected polar co-monomers to a poly-olefin.<br>
Examples of alpha olefins or other oleofenically unsaturated hydrocarbons which have been used for manufacture of this group of co-polymers individually or in combination with one another, were already counted above in the description of the manufacture of homo or copolymers, derived from one or several alpha olefins.<br><br>
Ideally, one would place in the group of modified polyolefins, polypropylene or especially polyethylene or copolymers derived from ethylenes and acrylic acids and/or methacrylic acid esters, especially alkyl esters.<br>
The invention-based heat sealing adhesive can contain in addition also other auxiliary materials which are customary. These are added depending upon the desired profile of the characteristics and the methodology of application and processing of the hot sealing adhesives. Examples for such additives are emulgators, thickeners, pigments and processing auxiliaries.<br>
The material characteristics of the bottom layer on the coated/laminated textile non-woven fabric are to be purposefully so selected that they possess lesser thermoplastic flow under the conditions of the hot sealed adhesive coating than the upper layer lying over it. This is possible to be achieved as per the invention through application of hot sealing adhesives with the indicated ranges for the melt index corresponding to the melt viscosity of the hot sealing coat.<br>
The hot sealing adhesives are applied in form of a regular or ideally irregular specimen on the surface of the non-woven textile fabric. The coating patterns can be linear, cross or spiral shaped or can be designed in any other regular or irregularly arranged screen form. Ideally the hot sealing adhesives are applied in the form of dot patterns, which are preferably irregular.<br>
In a preferred design form, the bottom layer lying directly beneath the non-woven fabric contains 90 to 100 weight percentage of polypropylene and 0 to 10 weight percentage of polyethylene of high density (HOPE) and the upper layer lying on the bottom layer contains a polypropylene having identical or a higher melt flow than the polymer applied in the lower or bottom layer.<br><br>
In yet another preferred design form, the bottom layer applied on a non-woven fabric consists of a paste, which was applied in the form of an irregular dot pattern on the non-woven fabric, and the upper layer above it consist of a powder or a powder compound which was applied on the non-woven fabric. On the spots on which the paste is found, the powder compound is held firmly while at the other spots of the surface of the non-woven fabric they allow themselves to be easily removed.<br>
The ratio of the weight/mass of the invention-based first and secondary hot sealing adhesives can fluctuate within a large range and moves typically in the range of 5:1 and 1:5, ideally in the range of 2:1 and 1:3.<br>
The invention relates also to a process for the manufacture of the textile non-woven fabric described above. The process covers the following steps:<br>
a)	manufacture of a textile non-woven fabric through a textile surface creation technique in a manner that is in itself well-known<br>
b)	applying of a layer of a first hot sealing adhesive in form of a regular or irregular specimen on the textile non-woven fabric again in a manner that in itself is known<br>
c)	applying a layer of a second hot sealing adhesive on the non-woven fabric so that a layer from the second hot sealing adhesive gets created over the layer of the first hot sealing adhesive in a manner which in itself is known<br>
In this context the first and the second hot sealing adhesives are used as per the definitions given above.<br><br>
With regard to the process, it relates to a modified double point/dot process, which is characterized through the application of selected hot sealing adhesives.<br>
The manufacture of the invention based hot sealing adhesive can happen in different ways.<br>
Examples for this are the grinding of the component with subsequent powder mixing, the mixing of the components in granulate form with subsequent grinding as well as the mixing of the components by means of extrusions followed by the final grinding.<br>
The application of the hot sealing adhesive can be done similarly according to different processes.<br>
For instance, in a first step a paste of the first hot sealing adhesive can be applied on the textile non-woven fabric in the form of a regular or ideally irregular specimen. The application can happen in this context through screen.printing or placement through a structured roller. In a second step, a powder can then be sprayed from the second hot sealing adhesive on the textile non-woven fabric, which remains stuck on the first hot sealing adhesive to the paste. From the rest of the spots of the surface of the textile non-woven fabric the powder can be removed through suction. In a subsequent thermal treatment, the first and second hot sealing adhesives are fixed as layers lying one over the other.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric modified as per the invention allows itself to be used as inlay or lining material. The invention relates also to the use for these purposes especially as stiffening inlay and/or as lining material subjected to very high stresses and requirements in the healthcare industry.<br><br>
Especially the invention-based textile non-woven fabrics are suitable for use as stiffening inlay or reinforcement inlay of collars and cuffs of professional uniforms.<br>
The invention-based modified textile non-woven fabrics can be pasted into a textile surface to be reinforced using an already known method.<br>
The following examples explain the invention without limiting it to these alone.<br>
Example 1<br>
100% polyester ("PES") fleece material basis with 100 g/m2 surface weight was coated as per the double dot / point process which in itself is known. In this context, for the bottom point a paste was used which was made of the customary auxiliary materials such as emulgator, thickener and process auxiliary materials. This paste includes as polymer material a HOPE with a melting point of 130°C and a MFI value of 10 (g/10 mins under 190°C under a load of 2,16 kg). A polyurethane powder with a melting range of 145-155°C and a MFI value of &gt; 200 (g/10 mins under 190°C/load of 2,16 kg) was applied as spray powder for the upper point.<br>
In the coating/lamination process, 12 g bottom point paste was applied and covered with 25 g of spray powder.<br>
The inlay manufactured in this manner could be fixed under temperatures of 175°C against diverse upper material with a very good adhesion and was resistant against a 95°C wash.<br><br>
The adhesion strength obtained was after the fixing (175720 s/bar - gygli shirt press) under 21,6n/5cm after 10 times of QS'^C wash and drying under 17,4 N/5cm.<br>
After fixing with 30 s fixing time, the adhesion strength was 30,7N/5cm after 10 times of 95°C wash and drying under 17,4N/5cm.<br>
This inlay fixed as above with 25s under identical press adjustment withstood 28 cycles of an industry wash without any bubble with subsequent drying each time in the tunnel finisher.<br>
Example 2<br>
A fabric made of 100% cotton pre-treated and equipped for application as shirt lining with 130 g/m^ surface weight was coated as per double point dot process. For the bottom point, a paste composed of the customary auxiliary materials such as emulgator, thickener and process auxiliary materials was used. The paste contained as polymer components a polypropylene with a melting point of 160°C and a MFI value of 50 (g/10 min under 190°C and 2,16 kg load). A polypropylene with a melting point of 160°C and a MFI value of greater than 150 (g/10 min under 190°C and 2,16 kg load) was used as spray powder. In the coating process, 10 g bottom point paste was applied and with 19 g spray powder covered.<br>
The sheet manufactured in such a manner could be fixed under temperatures of 180°C against different upper materials with very good adhesion and was resistant against a 95°C wash.<br><br>
The adhesion strength achieved after the fixation (180°C/20s/2bar - Gygli Shirt Press) was 23,5 N/5 cm, after ten times of 95°C wash and drying under 21,2N/5cm. After fixing with a fixing time of 30 seconds, the adhesion strength was 25,7 N/5cm after ten times of 95°C wash and drying it was 22,5N/5cm. This inlay fixed as above with 25 seconds under identical press settings withstood more than 50 cycles of an industry wash with subsequent drying respectively in tunnel finisher without development of any bubbles.<br><br><br><br>

In a second step, a powder of a second hot sealing adhesive is sprinkled on the textile non-woven fabric, which remains stuck at the spots of the first hot sealing adhesive to the paste, and from the rest of the spots of the surface of the textile non-woven fabric the powder is removed through suction and that in a subsequent thermal treatment, the first and second hot sealing adhesives are fixed as layers lying one over the other.<br>
16.	Use of the textile non-woven fabric according to one of the claims 1 to 13 as lining material and/or as inlay material for requirements with very high quality-care specifications.<br>
17.	Use of the textile non-woven fabric according to claims 13 as stiffening<br>
inserts of reinforcement linings of collars and cuffs of industrial uniforms.<br><br><br>
summary<br>
The invention relates to a textile non-woven fabric with a coating made of two layers lying one over the other of thermoplastic, hot sealing adhesives of different compositions where the second hot sealing adhesive applied on the first hot sealing adhesive has a melting point greater than 135°C and a melt flow index (MFI) value of 50 to 250 g/10 minutes (190°C/2,16 kg).<br>
The invention relates to a process for manufacture of textile non-woven fabric consisting of the following steps:<br>
a)	manufacture of a textile non-woven fabric through a textile surface creation technique<br>
b)	applying of a layer of a first hot sealing adhesive on the textile non-woven fabric<br>
c)	applying a layer of a second hot sealing adhesive on the non-woven fabric so that<br>
d)	a layer from the second hot sealing adhesive gets created over the layer of the first hot sealing adhesive, where as second hot sealing adhesive, one with a melting point of greater than 135°C and a melt flow index (MFI) value of 50 to 250 g/10 mins (190°C/2,16 kg) is applied.<br>
The textile non-woven fabric allows itself to be used as lining or inter-lining or inlay material where very high quality-care requirements are specified.<br></td>
