				<td>MICROPOROUS FILTER MEDIUM, FILTER SYSTEM<br>
COMPRISING IT AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME<br>
The present invention is directed to filter media having<br>
microbiological interception capability, filtration systems containing such<br>
filter media, and methods of making and using same.<br>
Modern consumer water filters often provide "health claims" including<br>
reduction of particulates, heavy metals, toxic organic chemicals, and select<br>
microbiological threats. These filtration systems have been able to intercept<br>
microorganisms such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia using roughly 1.0<br>
micron structures. However, in order to provide microbiological interception<br>
of even smaller microbiological threats such as viruses, a filter medium<br>
having a sub-micron microporous structure is required. Prior art filtration<br>
systems often attempt to achieve broad microbiological interception using<br>
filter media with insufficiently small pore size and with poor physical<br>
integrity. The balance between the necessary pore structure required for<br>
successful microbiological interception and satisfactory filter performance has<br>
not been achieved.<br>

on at least a portion of the microporous structure, and wherein a biologically<br>
active metal is caused to precipitate with at least a portion of the counter ion<br>
associated with the cationic material, wherein a microbiologically<br>
contaminated influent flowing through the housing and contacting the filter<br>
medium has at least about 4 log reduction in microbiological contaminants in<br>
an effluent flowing from the housing.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a process of<br>

structure having a mean flow path of less than about 2 microns.<br>
In still yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a<br>

cationic material having a high charge density and a molecular weight greater<br>
than about 5000 Daltons in combination with a biologically active metal.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of<br>

active particles and having a mean flow path of less than about 2 microns;<br>
and a microbiological interception enhancing agent comprising a cationic<br>
material having a medium to high charge density and a molecular weight<br>

The Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medium<br>
A filter medium of the present invention has a microporous structure<br>
that provides microbiological interception capability using a combination of<br>
an appropriate pore structure and a chemical treatment. The microporous<br>
structure comprises an array of active particles that have a specific pore<br>
structure, as well as adsorbent and/or absorbent properties. The array can be<br><br>
a solid composite block, a monolith, a ceramic candle, a flat-sheet composite<br>
of bonded or immobilized particles formed into a coherent medium using a<br>
binder or supporting fibers, and the like. These particle arrays can be made<br>
through processes known in the art such as, for example, extrusion, molding,<br>
or slip casting. The chemical treatment process used to treat the surface of<br>
the microporous structure utilizes a synergistic interaction between a cationic<br>
material and a biologically active metal, that when combined, provide broad-<br>
spectrum reduction of microbiological contaminants on contact. The charge<br>
provided by the cationic material to the filter medium aids in electro-kinetic<br>
interception of microbiological contaminants, while the tight pore structure<br>
provides a short diffusion path and, therefore, rapid diffusion kinetics of<br>
microbiological contaminants in a flowing fluid to a surface of the<br>
microporous structure. The microporous structure also provides<br>
supplemental direct mechanical interception of microbiological<br>
contaminants. Due to the dominant role of diffusion for the interception of<br>
extremely small particles, there is a direct correlation between the log<br>
reduction value of viral particles and the contact time of the influent within<br>
the filter medium, rather than a dependence upon the thickness of the filter<br>
medium.<br>
Characteristics of the Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter<br>
Medium<br>
In order to provide full microbiological interception capability, the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present invention<br>
has a mean flow path of less than about 2 microns, and more preferably less<br>
than or equal to about 1 micron, if the mean flow path is greater than about<br>
2 microns, then the diffusion efficiency of viral particles rapidly declines and<br>
efficient biological interception fails. The volume of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium of the present invention compared to<br><br>
the flow rate of fluid through the filter medium must be sufficient to provide a<br>
contact time adequate for the contaminants to diffuse to a surface of the filter<br>
medium.	To provide enhanced electro-kinetic interception of<br>
microorganisms, of which the majority are negatively charged, at least a<br>
portion of the microporous structure is coated with a cationic material to<br>
produce a positive charge on at least a portion of such microporous structure.<br>
The cationic material is of sufficient molecular size to prevent fouling of the<br>
micro-pores and mezo-pores of the active particles.<br>
Natural organic matter (NOM), such as polyanionic acids, i.e., humic<br>
acid or fulvic acid, that can reduce or remove the charge on the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium, is preferably prevented<br>
from contacting the charged microporous structure through the use of an<br>
adsorbent prefilter that substantially removes the NOM. It is possible to<br>
incorporate the NOM removing material directly into the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium, thereby eliminating the need for a<br>
separate adsorbent prefilter. Also, depending on the type of active particles<br>
used, the upstream portion of the microbiological interception enhanced<br>
filter medium itself can naturally reduce or remove NOM as well and prevent<br>
a loss of performance of the downstream portions of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium.<br>
When used in the context of a gravity-flow water filtration system, it is<br>
preferable that the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium be<br>
made with hydrophilic materials or treated with a wetting agent to provide<br>
good, spontaneous wettability. Alternatively, in other applications, the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium can be treated to<br>
provide either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristic as needed. It is<br>
possible that the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium can<br>
have both positively and negatively charged and uncharged regions, and/or<br><br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. For example, the negatively charged<br>
regions can be used to enhance the interception of less common positively<br>
charged contaminants and uncharged hydrophobic regions can be used to<br>
provide enhanced interception of contaminants that are attracted to<br>
hydrophobic surfaces.<br>
The Active Particles<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium having<br>
enhanced microbiological interception capabilities of the present invention<br>
comprises an array of adsorbent and/or absorbent active particles having a<br>
particle size distribution of 80 x 325 mesh with about 20% to about 24% pan<br>
(particles smaller than -325 mesh). The active particles can include, but are<br>
not limited to, activated carbon, activated alumina, zeolites, diatomaceous<br>
earth, silicates, aluminosilicates, titanates, bone char, calcium<br>
hydroxyapatite, manganese oxides, iron oxides, magnesia, perlite, talc,<br>
polymeric particulates, clay, iodated resins, ion exchange resins, ceramics,<br>
super absorbent polymers (SAPs), and combinations thereof. A<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium having requisite<br>
properties can be obtained by combining one or more of these active<br>
particles.<br>
One preferred microporous structure comprises active particles of<br>
activated carbon that naturally resist fouling by NOM and is efficient at<br>
adsorbing the potentially interfering NOM in peripheral regions of the<br>
microporous structure while protecting inner regions. Preferably, the<br>
activated carbon is acid washed bituminous coal-based activated carbon.<br>
Commercially available activated carbon suitable for use in the present<br>
invention can be obtained from Calgon Carbon Corporation of Pittsburgh,<br>
Pennsylvania, under the trade designation TOG-NDS or from California<br>
Carbon Company of Wilmington, California, under the trade designation <br>
1240ALC. Most preferably, the active particles are comprised of acid washed<br>
bituminous coal-based activated carbon from Calgon Carbon Corporation,<br>
having a particle size distribution as follows: about 3% to about 7%,<br>
preferably about 5%, 80 mesh size particles; about 12% to about 18%,<br>
preferably about 15% 100 mesh; about 44% to about 50%, preferably 47%<br>
200 mesh; about 8% to about 14%, preferably about 11% 325 mesh; and<br>
about 20% to about 24% pan, preferably about 22% pan.<br>
The Microbiological Interception Enhancing Agent<br>
The active particles of the microporous structure are chemically<br>
treated with a microbiological interception enhancing agent capable of<br>
creating a positive charge on the surface of the active particles. The chemical<br>
treatment produces a strong positive charge upon the treated surfaces as<br>
measured using streaming potential analysis and this positive charge is<br>
retained at pH values below 10. A cationic metal complex is formed on at<br>
least a portion of the surface of the active particles by treating the active<br>
particles with a cationic material. The cationic material may be a small<br>
charged molecule or a linear or branched polymer having positively charged<br>
atoms along the length of the polymer chain.<br>
if the cationic material is a polymer, the charge density is preferably<br>
greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 20 Angstroms, preferably<br>
greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 10 Angstroms, and more<br>
preferably greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 5 Angstroms of<br>
molecular length. The higher the charge density on the cationic material, the<br>
higher the concentration of the counter ion associated therewith. A high<br>
concentration of an appropriate counter ion can be used to drive the<br>
precipitation of a metal complex. The high charge density of the cationic<br>
polymer provides the ability to adsorb and significantly reverse the normal<br>
negative charge of active particles such as carbon. The cationic material<br><br>
should consistently provide a highly positively charged surface to the<br>
microporous structure as determined by a streaming or zeta potential<br>
analyzer, whether in a high or low pH environment.<br>
The use of a polymer of sufficiently high molecular weight allows<br>
treatment of the surfaces of the active particles without serious attendant<br>
impact upon the adsorptive capabilities of the mezo-pores and micro-pores of<br>
the active particles. The cationic material can have a molecular weight<br>
greater than or equal to about 5000 Daltons, preferably greater than or equal<br>
to 100,000 Dalton, more preferably greater than or equal to about 400,000<br>
Daltons, and can be greater than or equal to about 5,000,000 Daltons.<br>
The cationic material includes, but is not limited to, quaternized<br>
amines, quaternized amides, quaternary ammonium salts, quaternized<br>
imides, benzalkonium compounds, biguanides, cationic aminosilicon<br>
compounds,, cationic cellulose derivatives, cationic starches, quaternized<br>
polyglycol amine condensates, quaternized collagen polypeptides, cationic<br>
chitin derivatives, cationic guar gum, colloids such as cationic melamine-<br>
formaldehyde acid colloids, inorganic treated silica colloids, polyamide-<br>
epichlorohydrin resin, cationic acrylamides, polymers and copolymers<br>
thereof, combinations thereof, and the like. Charged molecules useful for<br>
this application can be small molecules with a single charged unit and<br>
capable of being attached to at least a portion of the microporous structure.<br>
The cationic material preferably has one or more counter ions associated<br>
therewith which, when exposed to a biologically active metal salt solution,<br>
cause preferential precipitation of the metal in proximity to the cationic<br>
surface to form a cationic metal precipitate complex.<br>
Exemplary of amines may be pyrroles, epichlorohydrin derived<br>
amines, polymers thereof, and the like. Exemplary of amides may be those<br>
polyamides disclosed in International Patent Application No. WO 01/07090,<br><br>
and the like. Exemplary of quaternary ammonium salts may be<br>
homopolymers of diallyl dimethyl ammonium halide, epichlorohydrin<br>
derived polyquaternary amine polymers, quaternary ammonium salts derived<br>
from diamines and dihalides such as those disclosed in United States Patent<br>
Nos. 2,261,002, 2,271,378, 2,388,614, and 2,454,547, all of which are<br>
incorporated by reference, and in International Patent Application No. WO<br>
97/23594,	also	incorporated	by	reference,<br>
polyhexamethylenedimethylammonium bromide, and the like. The cationic<br>
material may be chemically bonded, adsorbed, or crosslinked to itself and/or<br>
to the active particles.<br>
Furthermore, other materials suitable for use as the cationic material<br>
include BIOSHIELD® available from BioShield Technologies, Inc., Norcross,<br>
Georgia. BIOSHIELD® is an organosilane product including approximately<br>
5% by weight octadecylaminodimethyltrimethoxysilylpropyl ammonium<br>
chloride and less than 3% chloropropyltrimethoxysilane. Another material<br>
that may be used is SURFACINE®, available from Surfacine Development<br>
Company LLC, Tyngsboro, Massachusetts. SURFACINE® comprises a three-<br>
dimensional	polymeric network obtained by	reacting<br>
poly(hexamethylenebiguanide) (PHMB) with 4,4'-methlyene-bis-N,N-<br>
dilycidylaniline (MBGDA), a crosslinking agent, to covalently bond the<br>
PHMB to a polymeric surface. Silver, in the form of silver iodide, is<br>
introduced into the network, and is trapped as submicron-sized particles.<br>
The combination is an effective biocide, which may be used in the present<br>
invention. Depending upon the active particles, the MBGDA may or may<br>
not crosslink the PHMB to the microporous structure.<br>
The cationic material is exposed to a biologically active metal salt<br>
solution such that the metal complex precipitates onto at least a portion of<br>
the surface of at least some of the active particles. For this purpose, the<br><br>
metals that are biologically active are preferred. Such biologically active<br>
metals include, but are not limited to, silver, copper, zinc, cadmium,<br>
mercury, antimony, gold, aluminum, platinum, palladium, and combinations<br>
thereof. The most preferred biologically active metals are silver and copper.<br>
The biologically active metal salt solution is preferably selected such that the<br>
metal and the counter ion of the cationic material are substantially insoluble<br>
in an aqueous environment to drive precipitation of the metal complex.<br>
Preferably, the metal is present in an amount of about 0.01 % to about 2.0%<br>
by weight of the total composition.<br>
A particularly useful microbiological interception enhancing agent is a<br>
silver-amine-halide complex. The cationic amine is preferably a<br>
homopolymer of diallyl dimethyl ammonium halide having a molecular<br>
weight of about 400,000 Daltons or other quaternary ammonium salts having<br>
a similar charge density and molecular weight. A homopolymer of diallyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium chloride useful in the present invention is commercially<br>
available from Nalco Chemical Company of Naperville, Illinois, under the<br>
tradename MERQUAT® 100. The chloride counter ion may be replaced with<br>
a bromide or iodide counter ion. When contacted with a silver nitrate<br>
solution, the silver-amine-halide complex precipitates on at least a portion of<br>
the active particles of the microporous structure of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium.<br>
Where the active particles comprise activated carbon, the cationic<br>
material preferably has a high charge density and a sufficiently high<br>
molecular weight to create a strong attraction and high coordination energy<br>
with the negatively charged surface groups of activated carbon. Also, the<br>
enhanced interception using the charged surface of the activated carbon, in<br>
the presence of a colloid of a biologically active metal, is supplemented by<br>
the hydrophobic adsorption mechanism of the activated carbon. This<br><br>
hydrophobic mechanism is generally resistant to the impact of fouling by<br>
NOM, and is actually more effective under conditions of high ionic strength.<br>
Untreated portions of the carbon surface, with their oxygen-rich chemistry,<br>
tend to have a negative charge that can continue to adsorb positively charged<br>
particles. The combination of positive, negative, and hydrophobic surfaces<br>
presents a nearly insurmountable barrier for small particles to navigate. After<br>
treating the carbon with the microbiological interception enhancing agent,<br>
the presence of the biologically active metal and its associated counter ion on<br>
the active particles can be detected using X-ray fluorescence.<br>
Method Of Making The Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter<br>
Medium<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the<br>
present invention can be made in accordance with processes known to one<br>
of skill in the art. Such processes include extrusion, molding, slip casting,<br>
immobilizing the active particles on a substrate, and the like. Exemplary<br>
processes are disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,019,311, and<br>
5,792,513.<br>
The active particles are treated with the cationic material using means<br>
known to one of skill in the art such as, for example, spray coating.<br>
Preferably, the active particles are coated with about 0.5% to about 3% by<br>
weight, and more preferably about 1 % by weight of the total weight of the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. Once the cationic<br>
material is coated onto at least a portion of the active particles, the particles<br>
are exposed to the biologically active metal salt. A solution of the metal salt<br>
is infiltrated into the particles to cause precipitation of the biologically active<br>
metal on at least a portion of the surface of the active particles. The<br>
precipitation process accurately deposits the majority of the metal colloid<br><br>
directly adjacent to the cationic coating because the counter-ion associated<br>
with this coating reacts with the applied metal salt to form the colloidal<br>
particles. The metal salt can be sprayed onto the treated particles or<br>
otherwise applied using methods known to one of skill in the art. Solutions<br>
of the cationic material and the metal salt are preferably made with nearly<br>
ion-free water so that the counter-ions associated with the cationic material<br>
are drawn tightly against the cationic surface of the treated active particles<br>
and to eliminate unwanted ions that may cause uncontrolled precipitation of<br>
the biologically active metal into sites remote from the cationic surface.<br>
Excess moisture is then removed from the particles, generally with<br>
heating or under vacuum, to a desired moisture content. Preferably, the<br>
moisture content should be less than about 10%, and more preferably less<br>
than about 5%, if the particles are to be subsequently extruded or molded<br>
using a thermoplastic binder.<br>
Once the microbiological interception enhancing agent is coated on<br>
to at least a portion of the active particles, the active particles are ground to<br>
the desired size and potentially mixed with the binder material to form a<br>
homogenous mixture prior to immobilizing the active particles into a desired<br>
final form having the required microporous structure. The binder is chosen<br>
such that the melting point of the binder material is sufficiently lower than<br>
the melting point of the active particles so that the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium can be heated to activate the binder<br>
material, while the microporous structure does not melt and thereby lose<br>
porosity. The binder particles are preferably sufficiently evenly distributed<br>
throughout the active particles such that later, upon conversion to the<br>
microporous structure, the binder particles will entrap or bond to<br>
substantially all the active particles.<br><br>
Binder materials useful in the present invention in coalescing the<br>
active particles into the microporous structure can potentially include any<br>
thermoplastic or thermoset material known in the art in either fiber, powder<br>
or particulate form. Useful binder materials can include materials such as,<br>
but not limited polyolefins, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl<br>
ethers, polyvinyl sulfates, polyvinyl phosphates, polyvinyl amines,<br>

polyarylates, phenol-formaldehyde resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins,<br>
formaldehyde-ureas, ethyl-vinyl acetate copolymers, co-polymers and block<br>
interpolymers thereof, and combinations thereof. Variations of the above<br>
materials and other useful polymers include the substitution of groups such<br>
as hydroxyl, halogen, lower alkyl groups, lower alkoxy groups, monocyclic<br>
aryl groups, and the like.<br>
A more detailed list of binders which can be useful in the present<br>
invention include end-capped polyacetals, such as poly(oxymethylene) or<br>
polyformaldehyde, poly(trichloroacetaldehyde), poly(n-valeraldehyde),<br>
poly(acetaldehyde), and poly(propionaldehyde); acrylic polymers, such as<br>
polyacrylamide, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(ethyl<br>
acrylate), and poly(methyl methacrylate); fluorocarbon polymers, such as<br>
poly(tetrafluoroethylene), perfluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymers,<br>
ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymers, poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene),<br>
ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, polyvinylidene fluoride), and<br>
polyvinyl fluoride); polyamides, such as poly(6-aminocaproic acid) or poly(e-<br>
caprolactam), poly(hexamethylene adipamide), poly(hexamethylene<br>
sebacamide), and poly(11-aminoundecanoic acid); polyaramides, such as<br>
poly(imino-1,3-phenyleneiminoisophthaloyl)	or	poly(m-phenylene<br>
isophthalamide); parylenes, such as poly-2-xylylene, and poly(chloro-1-<br><br>
xylylene); polyaryl ethers, such as poly(oxy-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene) or<br>
poly(p-phenylene oxide); polyaryl sulfones, such as poly(oxy-1,4-<br>
phenylenesulfonyl-1,4-phenyleneoxy-1,4-phenyl-eneisopropylide ne-1,4-<br>
phenylene), and poly(sulfonyl-1,4-phenylene-oxy-1,4-phenylenesulfonyl4,4'-<br>
biphenylene); polycarbonates, such as poly-(bisphenol A) or<br>
poly(carbonyldioxy-1,4-phenyleneisopropylidene-1,4-phenylene); polyesters,<br>
such as polyethylene terephthalate), poly(tetramethylene terephthalate), and<br>
poly(cyclohexyl-ene-1,4-dimethylene terephthalate) or poly(oxymethylene-<br>
1,4-cyciohexylenemethyleneoxyterephthaloyl); polyaryl sulfides, such as<br>
poly(p-phenylene sulfide) or poly(thio-1,4-phenylene); polyimides, such as<br>
poly(pyromeHitimido-1,4-phenylene); polyolefins, such as polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(l-pentene), poly(2-<br>
pentene), poly(3-methyl-1-pentene), and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene); vinyl<br>
polymers, such as polyvinyl acetate), poly(vinylidene chloride), and<br>
polyvinyl chloride); diene polymers, such as 1,2-poIy-1,3-butadiene, 1,4-<br>
poiy-1,3-butadiene, polyisoprene, and polychloroprene; polystyrenes; and<br>
copolymers of the foregoing, such as acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene (ABS)<br>
copolymers. Polyolefins that can be useful include polyethylene, linear low<br>
density polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(1-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(1-<br>
pentene), poly(2-pentene), poly(3-methyl-1-pentene), poly(4-methyl-1-<br>
pentene), and the like.<br>
Other potentially applicable materials include polymers such as<br>
polystyrenes and acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers, styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymers, and other non-crystalline or amorphous polymers and structures.<br>
Preferred binder materials include polyethylene, poly(ethylene vinyl<br>
acetate), and nylons. Especially preferred as a binder is grade FN 510<br>
microfine polyethylene commercially available from Equistar Chemicals, L.P.,<br>
Tuscola, Illinois, under the trade designation MICROTHENE® F.<br><br>
The binder can have an average particle size of about 0.1 micron to<br>
about 250 microns, preferably about 1 micron to about 100 microns, and<br>
more preferably about 5 microns to about 20 microns. It is preferable that<br>
the binder material have a softening point that is significantly lower than a<br>
softening point of the active particles so that the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium can be heated to activate the binder material, while<br>
the microporous structure does not melt and thereby lose porosity.<br>
The amount of binder material used is dependent upon how the<br>
microporous structure is formed whether by extrusion, molding, or other<br>
processes. For example, when the active particles are extruded or molded<br>
into a solid composite block, the binder material is preferably present in an<br>
amount of about 15% to about 22% by weight, and more preferably about<br>
17% to about 19% by weight of the microbiological interception enhanced<br>
filter medium. When the active particles are immobilized on a substrate such<br>
as, for example, a nonwoven material, the binder material is preferably<br>
present in an amount of about 5% to about 20%, and preferably about 9% to<br>
about 15% by weight of the total composition.<br>
One or more additives either in a particulate, fiber, whisker, or<br>
powder form may also be mixed with the active particles to aid in adsorption<br>
or absorption of other contaminants or participate in the formation of the<br>
microporous structure and interception of microbiological contaminants.<br>
Useful additives may include, but are not limited to, metallic particles,<br>
activated alumina, activated carbon, silica, polymeric powders and fibers,<br>
glass beads or fibers, cellulose fibers, ion-exchange resins, engineered resins,<br>
ceramics, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, activated bauxite, fuller's earth,<br>
calcium sulfate, other adsorbent or absorbent materials, or combinations<br>
thereof. The additives can also be chemically treated to impart<br>
microbiological interception capabilities depending upon the particular<br><br>
application. Such additives are preferably present in a sufficient amount such<br>
that the fluid flow in the resultant microbiological interception enhanced<br>
filter medium is not substantially impeded when used in filtration<br>
applications. The amount of additives is dependent upon the particular use<br>
of the filtration system.<br>
Alternatively, the final microporous structure can be formed by slip<br>
casting or wet-forming the particles or fibers or such mixtures and<br>
subsequently causing binders or particles to sinter the ingredients together.<br>
In some cases, the particles can form their own binder as in bi-component<br>
fibers or low melting point resins. In some cases, the binder can be water<br>
soluble or cross-linkable resins or salts that when allowed to dry, or heated,<br>
or allowed to react, form the required bonds. Chemical binders can also be<br>
used as well as precipitated binders such as certain phosphate salts.<br>
Filtration Systems Utilizing The Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter<br>
Medium<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the<br>
present invention can be easily incorporated into prior art filtration systems<br>
that utilize particulate filtration medium immobilized as a solid composite<br>
blocks, flat, spiral or pleated sheets, monoliths, or candles. Preferably, a<br>
particulate prefilter is used in conjunction with the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium, positioned upstream from the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium, to remove as many<br>
particulate contaminants from the influent as possible prior to the influent<br>
contacting the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the present<br>
invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Porometry studies were performed with an Automated Capillary Flow<br>
Porometer available from Porous Materials, Inc., Ithaca, New York.<br>
Parameters determined, using standard procedures published by the<br>
equipment manufacturer, include mean flow pore size and gas (air)<br>
permeability. The flow of air was assayed at variable pressure on both the<br>
dry and wel: microbiological interception enhanced filter medium.<br>
Bacterial challenges of the microbiological interception enhanced<br>
filter media were performed using suspensions of Escherichia coli of the<br>
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) No. 11775 to evaluate the<br>
response to a bacterial challenge. The response to viral challenges was<br>
evaluated using MS2 Bacteriophage ATTC No. 15597-Bi. Other<br>
microorganisms tested include Brevundimonas diminuta ATCC No. 4335,<br>
Bacillus subtilis, also known as BC, ATCC No. 9375. The Standard<br>
Operating Procedures of the ATCC were used for propagation of the<br>
bacterium and bacteriophage, and standard microbiological procedures, as<br>
well known in the art, were used for preparing and quantifying the<br>
microorganisms in both the influent and effluent of filters challenged with<br>
suspensions of the microorganisms.<br>
Individual filters were tested in duplicate with each microorganism<br>
under a modified version of the NSF International Standard 53 cyst reduction<br>
test protocol. This protocol is designed to assess the performance of filters<br>
during an accelerated exposure to fine particulates to simulate accumulation<br>
of dirt. Filters were flushed with reverse osmosis/deionized (RO/DI) water<br>
and calibrated to an initial flow rate of 0.5 to 1.0 gallon/minute (gpm). The<br>
mean flow path of the filter media all were about 0.9 microns to 1.1 microns.<br><br>
During testing, initial samples were drawn from both the influent and<br>
effluent sampling ports during the startup system flushing period to ensure<br>
that there was no background interference from an improperly disinfected<br>
test apparatus. The filter was then challenged with suspensions of the<br>
microorganisms, with samples being taken following a minimum 2L<br>
challenge solution, ensuring passage of the challenge water through the<br>
entire test stand prior to sampling.<br>
All influent and effluent samples were serially diluted, as required,<br>
and plated in triplicate. In certain cases, carbon blocks of a given design<br>
were tested at several flow rates to ascertain their response to changing flow<br>
rate.<br>
Activated carbon block filters having enhanced microbiological<br>
interception capability were prepared as follows. Twenty (20) pounds of<br>
12x40 mesh acid-washed bituminous-coal-based activated carbon, obtained<br>
from Calgon Carbon Company, was gently mixed with a solution of 3%<br>
MERQUAT® 100 in de-ionized water to thoroughly coat the carbon particles<br>
and ensure that the MERQUAT® 100 had adsorbed onto at least a portion of<br>
the carbon particles. Thereafter, a solution of silver nitrate, 70 g crystalline<br>
silver nitrate in 1.0 L de-ionized water, was added to the MERQUAT® treated<br>
carbon to allow precipitation of the silver on at least a portion of the surface<br>
of the carbon particles in the form of silver chloride colloid. The treated<br>
carbon particles were dried at 135°C until there was less than 5% moisture<br>
present in the carbon particles. Drying times varied between about 3 to<br>
about 5 hours. The dried carbon was ground in a double-roll grinder to 80 x<br>
325 mesh size with approximately 14% by weight -325 mesh pan, and was<br>
mixed with FN510, a low density polyethylene binder material, at<br>
approximately 17% by weight. The mixture was extruded under suitable<br>
heat, pressure and temperature conditions, as described in U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
5,019,311. Resulting carbon block filters of various sizes were used to<br>
construct water filter systems by applying suitable end caps using a hot melt<br>
resin, as is well known in the art.<br>
The filters were assayed for microbiological interception performance<br>
under initial clean conditions and then at intervals following dirt<br>
accumulation where the flow was reduced by 25%, 50% and 75% in<br>
comparison to the flow rate measured on the original, clean filter.<br>
To achieve the required reduction in flow, "nominal" test dust<br>
challenge water was utilized. Nominal test dust is a silicate powder with<br>
particles roughly 0 to 5.0 microns in diameter and having 96% by weight of<br>
the particles in this range and 20% to 40% of the particles greater than 2.5<br>
microns. When the required flow reduction has been accomplished, the<br>
nominal test dust challenge was curtailed and the filter flushed with 4.0 L of<br>
reverse osmosis/deionized (RO/DI) water to remove any residual test dust<br>
from the influent and effluent lines. The filter is then challenged with the<br>
suspensions of the microorganisms, as described above.<br>
The efficacy of the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium of the present invention is shown in Tables I and II below.<br><br><br><br><br>
The microbiological interception enhanced activated carbon block<br>
filter medium of the present invention provides greater than 8 log reduction<br>
of larger organisms such as B. diminuta, E.coli and B. subtilis. In fact,<br>
interception of these organisms was beyond the sensitivity of the test protocol<br>
in all cases. The results for MS2 penetration show no apparent correlation<br>
between wall thickness and levels of interception. This indicates that a<br>
traditional mechanical interception mechanism is not responsible for MS2<br><br>
interception. However, there is a direct relationship between the log<br>
interception and the empty bed contact time (EBCT) of the filter. Fig. 1<br>
shows a substantially linear relationship between the initial, clean filter log<br>
MS2 reduction and the EBCT of the filter indicating a diffusive interception<br>
mechanism with a requirement of approximately 6 seconds EBCT in order to<br>
achieve effective reduction of this bacteriophage in a microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium having a mean flow path of about 0.9 to<br>
about 1.1 microns. For this reason, larger filters operating at lower flow rates<br>
perform more efficiently than small filters operating at elevated flow rates.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly described, in<br>
conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many<br>
alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that<br>
the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and<br>
variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.<br><br>
