				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to products comprising a macrocyclic lactone and an amidine, which products are suitable for controlling parasites, in particular ectoparasites, on animals.<br>
Macrocyclic lactones are, in particular in veterinary medicine, known as agents having both excellent endoparasiticidal action and, within certain limits, also ectoparasiticidal action.<br>
Amidines, such as, for example, amitraz.or cymiazole, are likewise already known as insecticides/acaricides.<br>
However, when used against ectoparasites, the active compounds of these two classes of substances have, when, applied externally, certain disadvantages, such as insufficient activity or side-effects. It would be desirable to have virtually 100% activity at a dosage which is as low as possible, to reduce side-effects.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that, when macrocyclic lactones and amidines are used in . combination, the ectoparasiticidal action is, in an unexpected manner, enhanced compared to the single preparations. It is thus possible to achieve good ectoparasiticidal activity at low dosages. In addition, in the case of a combined use, the compatibility is improved significantly.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to products comprising a macrocyclic lactone and an amidine.<br>
For the purpose, of this invention, macrocyclic lactones are in particular avermectins, 22,23-dihydroavermectins B1 (ivermectins) or milbemycins.<br>
Avermectins were isolated as microbial metabolites from the microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis (US-Pat. 4 310 519) and may essentially occur as a mixture comprising the eight components A1a, A1b, A2a, A2b, B1a, B1b, B2a and B2b (I- Putter et al. Experentia 37 (1981) p. 963, Birkhauser Verlag (Switzerland)). In addition, the synthetic derivatives, in<br>
particular 22,23-dihydroavermectin BI (ivermectin), are also of interest (US-Pat.<br>
4199 569). It is also possible to isolate milbemycin B-41D from Streptomyces<br>
hygroscopicus by fermentation (cf. "Milbemycin: Discovery and Development" I. Junya et<br>
al. Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. 45 (1993), pp. 1-98; JP-Pat. 8 378 549; GB 1 390 336).<br>
The use of avermectins, 22,23-dihydroavermectins BI (ivermectins) and milbemycins<br>
from the class of the macrocyclic lactones as endoparasiticides has been known for,a long<br>
time and is the subject of numerous patent applications and review articles (for example<br>
biological actions in: "Ivermectin and Abamectin" W. C. Campbell, Ed., Springer Verlag,<br>
New York, N. Y., 1989; "Avermectins and Milbemycins Part n" H. G. Davies et al. Chem.<br>
Soc. Rev. 20 (1991) pp. 271-339; chemical modifications in: G. Lukacs et al. (Eds.),<br>
Springer-Verlag, New York, (1990), Chapter 3; Cydectin™ [moxidectin and derivatives]:<br>
G. T. Carter et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. (1987), pp. 402-404); EP 423 445-Al).<br>
The use of doramectin (Pfizer) as an endoparasiticide is also known (cf. "Doramectin - a<br>
potent novel endectozide" A. C. Goudie et al. Vet. Parasitol. 49 (1993), pp. 5-15).<br>
The avermectins are compounds or compound mixtures of lactone macrolides of the<br>
general formula (I )<br>
( I )<br>
in which<br>
the radicals R1 to R4 are as defined in Table 1 below and X may represent a single or<br>
double bond between the €22- and C23-position (-C22R1-X-C23R2-).<br>
In the case of a double bond, there are no substituents (R1, R2) on the C22- and Oppositions.<br>
(Table Removed) 22,23-dihydroavermectin BI is ivermectin BI;<br>
sec-Bu = secondary butyl; iso-Pr = isopropyl; Chx = cyclohexyl; -Me = methyl<br>
The avermectins and 22,23-dihydroavermectins B (ivermectins) of the general formula (I)<br>
are generally employed as mixtures. Of particular interest is here the product abamectin<br>
which comprises essentially the avermectins BI and their hydrogenation products, the<br>
22,23-dihydroavermectins BI (ivermectin).<br>
The compounds of the macrocyclic lactones having an isopropyl radical in the exposition,<br>
which compounds are referred to by "b", do not necessarily have to be separated from the<br>
"a" compounds having a sec-butyl group in the C25-position. It is generally the mixture of<br>
both substances comprising  80% by weight of sec-butyl derivative (Bu) and  20% by<br>
weight of isopropyl derivative (Bib) which is isolated and which can be used according to<br>
the invention. Moreover, the substiruents in the C- and Cas-positions of the stereoisomers<br>
may be located either in the a- or in the p-position on the ring system, i.e. above or below<br>
the molecular plane. In each case, all stereoisomers fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
Milbemycins have the same macrolide ring structure as avermectins or 22,23-dihydroavermectins<br>
BI (ivermectins) but do not carry any substituent (i.e. they lack the<br>
oleandrose disaccharide fragment) in position 13 (R5 = hydrogen).<br>
Milbemycins from the class of the macrocyclic lactones which may be mentioned by way<br>
of example are the compounds of the general formula (II)<br>
(H)<br>
in which<br>
the radicals R1 to R5 are as defined in Table 2 below:<br>
(Table Removed) From among the compounds of the formulae (I) and (II), the following macrocyclic<br>
lactones are of particular interest according to the invention:<br>
avermectin Bia/B]b (or abamectin)<br>
22,23-dihydroavermectin Bia/Bib (or ivermectinBia/Bib)<br>
doramectin<br>
moxidectin<br>
In the literature, a 4:1 mixture of avermectin Bia and avermectin Bib is referred to as<br>
abamectin. According to the invention, abamectin is used with very particular preference.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, amidines are to be understood as amidine compounds<br>
having an arthropodicidal action. This is a class well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Typical amidines are cymiazole<br>
For the purpose of the invention, the active compounds are, if applicable, understood to<br>
include their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and prodrugs.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for controlling parasites, in<br>
particular ectoparasites, such as arthropods, preferably insects and arachnids, encountered<br>
in animal husbandry and livestock breeding, in productive livestock, breeding stock and<br>
pets. They are active against all or some stages of development of the pests and against<br>
resistant and normally sensitive species of the pests.<br>
By controlling the animal pests, it is intended to prevent diseases and their transmission,<br>
mortality and decreasing performance (for example in the production of meat, milk, hides,<br>
eggs), so that more economical and simpler animal keeping is possible, or so that in certain<br>
areas animal keeping is possible at all, by using the active compounds.<br>
The pests include:<br>
from the order of the Anoplura, for example, Haematopinus spp., Linognathus spp.,<br>
Solenopotes spp.,<br>
from the order of the Diptera, for example, Haematobia spp.,<br>
from the order of the Metastigmata, for example, Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus spp.,<br>
Boophilus spp., Amblyomma spp., Haemophysalis spp., Dermacentor spp., Ixodes spp.,<br>
Argas spp., Omithodorus spp., Otobius spp.,<br>
from the order of the Mesostigmata, for example, Dermanyssus spp., Omithonyssus spp.,<br>
Pneumonyssus spp.,<br>
from the order of the Prostigmata, for example, Demodex spp.,<br>
from the order of the Astigmata, for example, Psoroptes spp., Chorioptes spp., Otodectes<br>
spp., Sarcoptes spp., Notoedres spp., Knemidocoptes spp., Neoknemidocoptex spp.<br>
The products according to the invention are preferably employed against Boophilus spp., in<br>
particular Boophilus microplus.<br>

the macrocyclic lactone, preferred customary daily doses are in the range from 0.05 to<br>
5 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 3 mg/kg; for the amidine, customary daily doses are<br>
preferably in the range from 1 to 30 mg/kg, particularly preferably from 5 to 15 mg/kg.<br>
Particular preference according to the invention is given to pour-on or spot-on formulations.<br>
Such formulations comprise the macrocyclic lactone in amounts of from 0.01 to 10%<br>
by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1% by weight.<br>

between 10 and 98% by weight, preferably between 30 and 95% by weight.<br>
In addition, the preferred spot-on or pour-on formulations may comprise customary<br>
pharmaceutical additives and auxiliaries. Preference is given to adding, for stabilizing the<br>
active compounds, basic substances, such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide or<br>
triethanolamine, usually in concentrations of from 0.1 to 3% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 2% by weight.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the solvents used for the compositions according to<br>
the invention are mixtures of an alkanol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example ethanol<br>
or, in particular, isopropanol, with an aliphatic fatty acid ester, in particular a fatty acid<br>
ester of an aliphatic d-4-alcohol unit with a Ci2-i8-fatty acid, for example ethyl oleate,<br>
isopropyl myristate or isopropyl palmitate, and paraffin oil, in particular low-viscosity<br>
paraffin oil. With particular preference, the mixtures comprise these three components in<br>
each case in the same proportions by weight. As already indicated above, it is<br>
advantageous, if appropriate, to add a base such as triethanolamine to this solvent mixture.<br>
Spot-on or pour-on formulations can also be formulated as emulsion concentrates. In this<br>
case, a higher concentration of the active compounds is dissolved in a solvent together with<br>
a dispersant. The user adds a certain amount of this concentrate to water, resulting,<br>
spontaneously or after shaking, in the formation of an emulsion. The solvents used can be<br>
the substances mentioned above, and the dispersants used can be the ionic and non-ionic<br>
emulsifiers likewise mentioned above.<br>
Combined use means that the amidines and macrocyclic lactones can be used either<br>
separately or successively. In this case, the amidines and macrocyclic lactones are each<br>
formulated as separate medicaments. Simultaneous use is also feasible; according to the<br>
invention, amidine and macrocyclic lactone are preferably formulated together in a<br>
composition.<br>
Suitable examples of formulations of the active compound combination to be used<br>
according to the invention are given below; this does not limit the invention in any way:<br>

Biological example<br>
In vivo test on cattle with Boophilus microplus<br>
Prior to the start of the experiment, cattle were kept in individual stables for two weeks.<br>
After the adaptation phase, each cattle was, on days -24, -21, -19, -17, -14, -12, -10, -7, -5,<br>
-3 and -1, infested with 5000 larvae (0.25 g) of Boophilus microplus (collected in the field)<br>
of an age of 7 to 21 days. Day zero was the treatment day. On days -3 to day 51 after the<br>
treatment, ticks which had sucked themselves full were collected.<br>
Based on the average number of collected Boophilus microplus females collected on days<br>
-3, -2 and -1, the animals were grouped and divided into blocks, the number of which<br>
corresponded to the number of test groups. Within the blocks, the cattle were assigned on a<br>
random basis to the individual test groups.<br>

The efficacy in percent for each treatment was calculated using the formula below:<br>
Ta x Cb<br>
Efficacy in percent = 1- x 100<br>
Tb x Ca<br>
where:<br>
Ta = average number of ticks collected from the treated animals after the treatment;<br>
Tb = average number of ticks collected from the treated animals during the three days<br>
prior to the treatment;<br>
Ca = average number of ticks collected from the control animals in the phase after the<br>
treatment;<br>
Cb = average number of ticks collected from the control animals in the three days prior to<br>
the treatment.<br>
