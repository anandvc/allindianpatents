COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br><br>
[See Section 10 , RULE 13]<br><br>
Applicant:<br>
ESSILOR INTERNATIONAL COMPAGNIE GENERALE d'OPTIQUE, of 147 rue de Paris, F-94227 Charenton Cedex, France,<br>
The   following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature   of the invention    and    the    manner   in   which    it   is    to    be    performed:-<br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   process   for   making   a   cast polyurethane resin article.<br>
The present invention relates to polymerizable compositions for making polymerized thio containing resins, and in particular- fast curing compositions at room temperature as well as to a polymerization process for making such thio containing resins and especially a room temperature polymerization process.<br>
The polymerizable compositions and the polymerization process of the invention are particularly useful for making optical articles such as lenses, prisms, optical fibers, filters or for making different types of substrates, such as information recording substrates.<br>
The polymerizable compositions and the polymerization process of the invention are also specifically suited for making various coatings and in particular coatings for optical applications.<br>
(2) DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Plastic materials are widely used in the optical field and<br>
particularly in the opthalmic field for their lightness, high impact<br>
resistance and tintable capability by immersion in a bath containing an<br>
organic dye.	'<br>
Optically transparent plastic materials having a high refractive index nD = 1.6 or even higher have been developped recently which renders it possible to manufacture optical articles such as lenses of lower thickness for an equivalent corrective power (optical power).<br>
A class of such materials is comprised of polytfiioureuiane<br><br>
resins.<br>
Polythiourethane resins for making optical lenses are described in US-A-4/775,233-In this document, the polythiourethane resins are polymerized from polymerizable compositions comprising a polyisocyanate and a polythiol in the presence of a polymerization catalyst. The catalysts are tin complexes such as dibutyl tin dilaurate and the polymerization is a thermal polymerization.<br>
Document_JP-02166158A discloses a process for making polyurethane resin moulding which comprises adding in polyether polyol a thiocyanate salt such as ammonium thiocyanate or sodium thiocyanate, a crosslinking agent, catalysts and other additives and thereafter mixing with denatured diphenylmethane diisocyanate, filling into a reactant tank and injecting into a mould with heating. The catalysts are comprised of a dipropyleneglycol solution of triemylamine and dibutylene tin dilaurate.<br>
Another class of useful materials comprises the resins obtained by polymerization of a composition of polymerizable monomers including one or more polymerizable episulfide compounds.<br>
Episulfide compounds and their polymerization are disclosed m EP-A-761 655 and EP-A-785 194<br>
Unfortunately, the polymerization of these polymerizable compositions needs a long thermal cycle, generally between 8 hours to several days in order to obtain fully polymerized articles without striation or strain.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus,   the   aim   of   the   present   invention   is   to   provide polymerizable compositions for making thio containing resins which are    thermally    polymerizable    and    even    polymerizable at room temperature in a short time cycle.<br>
The invention also concerns' a polymerization process for making thio containing resins which necessitates shorter time cycle than the prior art processes.<br>
The invention further concerns optical articles such as lenses made of the thio containing resins resulting from the polymerization of the polymerizable compositions.<br><br>
It has now been discovered that, by using an effective amount of a salt of a specific class of salts as part of the catalyst or preferably as the sole catalyst in polymerizable compositions for making tbio containing resins, it was possible to use very short polymerization cycles while still obtaining a polymerized resin which is optically transparent and free of striations and having good mechanical, scratch and heat resistance properties.<br>

Polythiol monomers usually represent 30 to 70%, preferably 40 to 60% of the total weight of the polymenzable monomers present in the compositions.<br><br>
In general, the molar ratio of" NCO/SH ranges between 0.8 and 1.2.<br>
The preferred episulfide compounds for use in these compositions of the invention are those described in the above cited European patent applications EP-A-761 665 and 785 194. These episulfide compounds have two or more moieties of formula:<br><br>
at least one of these moities being an episulfide group.<br>
The polymerizable compositions of the invention may include up to 100% by weight of one or more of the episulfide compounds or the polymerizable compositions may comprise one or more episulfide compounds and one or more copolymerizable monomers.<br>
Among the preferred copolymerizable monomers are the polythiol monomers described above.<br>
For the composition containing the episulfide compound, the reactivity increases with the cation size of the salt (K salts are more reactive than sodium salts which are more reactive than lithium salts).<br>
The polymerizable compositions of the present invention preferably comprise a solvent promoting the dissolution of the salt<br>
catalyst within the polythiol monomer.<br>
Any polar organic solvent can be used such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurane or dioxane. However, to'avoid bubble generation, it is preferred to use a reactive solvent containing a hydroxyl function and most preferably a hydroxyl containing solvent further including one double bond capable of reacting with the thiol functions and one hydrogen labile function capable of reacting with the iso(thio)cyanate functions. Suitable solvents are methanol, emanol, acetone, acetonitrile and 3-methyl-2-butene-lol.<br>
The amount of solvent is generally kept below 2% by weight, based on the total"weight of the polymerizable monomers present, and preferably between 0 and 0.5% by weight, to avoid haze and bubbling.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, and necessarily when compositions include an episulfide monomer and ammonium salt as catalayst,   the  polymerizable  compositions  according to  the  present<br><br>
invention further include at least one electro-donor compound. The electro-donor compounds are preferably selected from the group consisting of acetonitrile compounds, amide compounds, sulfones, sulfoxides, trialkylphosphites, triarylphosphites, nitro compounds, ethyleneglycol ethers, crown ethers and kryptates. <br>
Examples of acetonitrile compounds are N=C-CH2-C=N and<br>
  in which<br>
R is an alkyl group, preferably a C1-C6 alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl.<br>
The amide compounds may be primary, secondary or tertiary<br>
amide compounds.<br>
The     trialkylphosphites     and     triarylphophites     may     be<br>
represented by formula:<br><br>
in which R, R', R'" are either an alkyl group, preferably a C1-C6 alkyl group or an aryl group such as a phenyl group. Preferred are trialkylphosphites, for example (C2H50)3P.<br>
Electro-donor compounds may also be selected from crown ethers and kryptates.<br>
These cyclic molecules are usually chosen to exhibit a good compromise between the heteroatom or metal size and the "cage" size, i.e. between the number of heteroatoms and the size of the cycle.<br>
The preferred crownethers and kryptates may be represented by the following formulae:<br><br><br>
wherein X1 represents O, S or NH, X1 is an integer from 3 to 6, preferably from 3 to 4,<br>
X-, X3 and X4 represent O or S, n9, n3, n4, y?, y3, y4 are 2 or 3, and x2, x3, x4, are 2 or 3.<br>
Among the preferred crown ethers and kryptates there may be cited the following compounds:<br><br>
I i<br><br><br>
The electro-donor compounds are present, based on the total weight of the polymerizable monomers in amounts ranging from 0 to 5% by weight, preferably 0 to 1% by weight.<br>
Preferred electro-donor compounds are crown-ethers, kryptates, trialkylphosphites and acetonitrile compounds.<br>
Some acetonitrile compounds may be used both as solvant and electro-donor compound.<br>
In general, electro-donor compounds stabilize the cation of the catalyst. They contribute to disociation of the anion/cation pair and thus increase the reactivity of the anion in the polymerization medium, and consequently the polymerization reaction.<br>
These electro-donor compounds are especially effective when the polymerizable composition includes an episulfide (which has a realtively low reactivity) and lower reactive diiols such as:<br><br><br>
The polymerizable compositions according to the invention may also include additives which are conventionally employed in polymerizable compositions intended for moulding optical articles, in particular ophthalmic lenses, in conventional proportions, namely inhibitors, dyes, UV absorbers, perfumes, deodorants, antioxidants, antiyellowing agents and release agents.<br>
The perfumes allow the odour of the compositions to be masked, in particular during surfacing or routering operations.<br>
In particular, usual UV absorbers such as those commercialized under the tradenames UV 5411®, UV 9®, Tinuvin400®, Tinuvin P® and Tinuvin 312® may be used in amounts generally up to 0.4% by weight of the total polymerizable monomers weight.<br>
Also, the compositions of the invention preferably comprise a release agent in an amount up to 0.1% by weight of the total polymerizable monomers weight.<br>
Among the release agents there may be cited mono and<br>
dialkyl phosphates, silicones, fluorinated hydrocarbon, fatty acids and<br>
ammonium salts. The preferred release agents are mono and dialkyl<br>
phosphates and mixtures thereof. Such release agents are disclosed<br>
inter alia in document US-A-4,662,376, US-A-4,975,328 and EP-<br>
271 839.	 <br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, polymerizable composition of the present invention is in the form of a two component polymerizable composition, i.e. a composition which is formulated as two separate components which are mixed together just before use.<br>
In that preferred two component embodiment, die composition comprises a first separate component or premix which contains the totality of the polyiso(thio)cyanate monomer, possibly, part or the totality of the polythiol monomer, and optionally the UV absorber and the mold release agent, and a second separate component or premix which comprises the thiocyanate salt catalyst, possibly part or the totality of the polythiol monomer, and optionally the solvent and the crown ether or kryptate.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred two component embodiment of the composition of the present invention, the first premix comprises:<br>
-	40-100 parts by weight of the polyiso(thio)cyanate<br>
monomer,<br>
-	0-60 parts by weight of the polythiol monomer;<br>
-	0-0.3 parts by weight of a UV absorber; and<br>
-	0-0.2 parts by weight of an internal mold release agent; and the second premix comprises<br>
-	0-100 parts by weight of the polythiol monomer;<br>
-	0-1 part by weight of solvent;<br>
-	0.001 to 0.01 part by weight of the salt catalyst; and<br>
-	0-5 parts by weight of an electro-donor compound.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are very reactive at room temperature, and a gel can be obtained within a polymerization time of 1 to 60 minutes, but in order to obtain striation free moulded articles, it is preferable to use a short gel time between 1 to 5 minutes.<br>
Therefore, the invention also concerns a process for making cast optical article, such as lenses, without a pot life issue, by mixing the required amounts of each of the ingredients of a composition according to the invention as described above, just before casting, and in particular in the form of a two component composition.<br>
Thus, the invention also concerns a process for making a cast polyurethane resin article, in particular an optical article such as a lens, which comprises:<br>
-	preparing a first premix containing the totality of the<br>
polyiso(thio)cyanate monomer and, possibly, port or the totality of the<br>
polythiol monomer, and optionally a UV absorber and a mold release<br>
agent;<br>
-	preparing a second premix containing the salt catalyst and, possibly, part or the totality of the polytihiol monomer, and optionally a solvent and an electro-donor compound;<br>
-	mixing the first premix and the second premix at room temperature in appropriate quantities;<br>
-	filling a mold with the mixed quantities of first and second<br><br>
premix   and  maintaining   at  room   temperature  until   a  hard   gel   is formed; and, thereafter<br>
-	curing the filled mold in an oven at an elevated temperature until complete polymerization; and<br>
-	removing the cast article from the mold.<br>
Generally, the weight ratio of the first premix to the second premix ranges from 2 to 10, preferably 4 to 10.<br>
The mixing, which can be a mechanical or ultrasonic mixing, is generally effected at room temperature for a duration ranging from 10 to 180 seconds.<br>
Gel formation inside the mold is effected at room temperature and has a duration ranging from 1 to 60 minutes, preferably 1 minute to less than 15 minutes and is generally about 10 minutes, although shorter gel time of 1 to 5 minutes may still be preferable.<br>
Curing at elevated temperature in an oven, for example an air oven, is generally effected at a temperature ranging from 50 to 150°C preferably 100 to 130°C and lasts usually for 2 to 4 hours.<br>
For example, the required amounts of premix 1 and premix 2 are filled inside two syringes' The syringe filing has been carried out with an electrical device or pneumatic device. By this way, the exact amounts of premix 1 and 2 can be easily adjusted and fixed for precise delivery.<br>
The two premixes are then added inside a small reactor chamber and then mixed by magnetic or mechanical stirrer for less titan 2 minutes. However, time of mixing usually ranges from 10 to 180 seconds. Static mixers, small reactor with magnetic bar or mechanical mixers, or screw mixers may be used. A slight vacuum may be used for bubbles removal if necessary.<br>
After mixing, the monomer is then dispensed from the reactor, using pressurized inert gas to fill the mold assembly. The mold assembly is conventional and consists of a two part mold in glass, metal or plastic, with a sealing gasket and a pressure clip to maintain sealing.<br>
Before being exposed to the thermal cycle to achieve full polymerization, the filled mold assembly stays at room temperature<br><br>
until hard gel formation, generally less than 15 minutes.<br>
Then gasket is removed and filled assembly is cured in air oven at 120°C for at least 2 hours.<br>
A static mixer can be used instead of small reactor, however the striations are greater. By implementing the rotation of the static element, the mixing becomes very similar to a screw system and generally the result in terms of striation is very good.<br>
Mixing by an ultrasonic system has also been used. In this case an adequate dosage (time intensity) resulting to a good compromise between kinetic acceleration, bubbles generation and mixing efficiency must be set-up.<br>
Thereafter the lenses can be tinted, coated to improve the scratch resistance, and an antireflective treatment can also be added.<br>
The present invention also concerns a cast polyurethane resin article and in particular an optical article such as a lens made of a composition according to the invention fully polymerized.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present jnvention. In these examples, unless otherwise stated, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
The performances of compositions and lenses were evaluated by the following procedure.<br>
-	Gel time was measured by the time needed by exothermic process to reach 50°C in a 50g sample. Time given in the tables is in minutes.<br>
-	Striation control on 6.00 bases lenses or vial samples with high intensity light box. + = no striation (optical quality); -M-= medium (very light striations acceptable for optical use); +++ = strong; ++++ = very strong.<br>
-	Aspect was evaluated by visual observation<br>
-	"Water white" means transparency  of optical quality.<br>

EXAMPLES 42.-44<br>
In the three following examples, two premixes were used in different ratios.<br>
Premix 1 was made by mixing in the proportions indicated in table 2, xylylene diisocyanate, pentaerythrytol tetramercapt6-propionate and UV 5411® in a flask.<br>
In another flask, premix 2 was prepared by mixing the rest of the pentaerythritol tetramercaptopropionate, 3-methyl 2-butene-l-ol and lidiium thyocyanate in the indicated proportions.<br>
By means of a syringe pump, the right amount of each premixes was dispensed inside a reactor. The mixing took one minute and by pressure, the formulation is transferred inside a mould assembly. After 10 minutes at room temperature, a gel was formed and gasket was removed. The assembly was cured at 120°C for 2 hours.<br>

EXAMPLE 45<br>
premix formulation as in example 38 was prepared but instead of using a mechanical stirred reactor, a static mixer is used.<br>
In term of striation, the result is not as good as the mechanical stirring.<br>
EXAMPLE 46<br>
To improve upon the result obtained in example 41, the internal elements of the static mixer were connected to a motor. In this case, the mixing device acts like a screw mixer, the result is very good and only minor striations are obtained (note +).<br>
