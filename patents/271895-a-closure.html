CLOSURE AND CONTAINER HAVING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a closure and a container having the same, and more<br>
particularly, to a closure and a container having the same, wherein the closure can be<br>
opened or closed through an up/down operation to hermetically keep contents at a<br>
pressure equal to, above or below the atmospheric pressure.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A container for storing beverages, powder or other contents is generally provided<br>
with a closure that requires to have a variety of functions depending on uses of the<br>
storing container or the stored contents.<br>
[3]	For example, since the internal pressure of a carbonated beverage container should be<br>
maintained at a pressure equal to or greater than the atmospheric pressure, it is<br>
important to maintain the airtightness of the closure during distribution of the<br>
container.<br>
[4]	In case of a container with large capacity, it is preferred that a closure be configured<br>
to be hermetically re-closed conveniently after opening the closure so that after the<br>
contents of the container arc used, the remainder of the contents can be stored without<br>
being deteriorated. For example, a cork closure has excellent airtightness but has a<br>
problem in that it is not easy to open the cork closure.<br>
[5]	Further, in case of a screw top that has been widely used in a conventional beverage<br>
container, it is inconvenient to use the screw top since the screw top should be rotated.<br>
Specifically, since children are too inexperienced in rotating the screw top to be<br>
opened/closed, it is very inconvenient for children to use the screw top.<br>
[6]	Particularly, the screw top should be strongly fastened in order to prevent contents<br>
from leaking out. In this case, however, it is difficult to re-open the screw top. On the<br>
contrary, if the screw top is closed only to the extent that the screw top can be easily<br>
operated, the contents of the container may leak out.<br>
[7]	In order to solve the above problems, the inventor proposed conveniently usable<br>
closure structures in Korean Patent No. 10-575259 (issued on April 24, 2006) and<br>
Korean Utility Model Registration No. 20-385497 (issued on May 21, 2005). Since<br>
these closures arc opened or closed in a one-touch manner, there is an advantage in that<br>
they can be more conveniently used as compared with a screw top.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[8]	The present invention is to improve the structures of conventional closures. Ac-<br><br>
cordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a closure which has air-<br>
tightness capable of sufficiently sealing contents even though the contents are stored in<br>
a container while being under a predetermined pressure, can be conveniently used, and<br>
is configured such that after initial opening of the closure, other users can easily<br>
recognize the opening of the closure, and a container having the closure.<br>

having a vertically movable annular body for surrounding an outer peripheral surface<br>
of the locking unit and including a push projection formed to protrude from an inner<br>
peripheral surface of the body and to be positioned below the locking unit, and a<br>
support projection formed to protrude at a position above die push projection to<br>
support the outer peripheral surface of the locking unit.<br>
[ 10]	According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a closure<br>
comprising: a sealing unit for surrounding a mouth of a container to ensure air-<br>
tightness; a locking unit having a plurality of locking projections hingedly connected<br>
inward to and along a lower end of the scaling unit so that the locking projections can<br>
be fixedly caught by a locking flange of the container, and a plurality of lever<br>
projections formed to protrude on an outer peripheral surface of the locking unit that is<br>
opposite to the locking projections; and a cover unit having a vertically movable<br>
annular body for surrounding the outer peripheral surface of the locking unit and<br>
including a push projection formed to protrude from an inner peripheral surface of the<br>
body and to be positioned below the lever projections.<br>
[11]	According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a container<br>
comprising: a container body having a locking flange protruding from an outer<br>
peripheral surface of a mouth of the container; and a closure fitted around the mouth<br>
while surrounding the mouth to ensure airtightness, wherein the closure comprises a<br>
sealing unit for surrounding the mouth of the container to ensure airtightness; a locking<br>
unit having a plurality of locking projections hingedly connected inward to and along a<br>
lower end of the sealing unit so that the locking projections can be fixedly caught by a<br>
locking flange of the container; and a cover unit having a vertically movable annular<br>
body for surrounding an outer peripheral surface of the locking unit and including a<br>
push projection formed to protrude from an inner peripheral surface of the body and to<br>
be positioned below the locking unit, and a support projection formed to protrude at a<br><br>
position above the push projection to support the outer peripheral surface of the<br>
locking unit.<br>
[12]	According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
container comprising: a container body having a locking flange protruding from an<br>
outer peripheral surface of a mouth of the container; and a closure fitted around the<br>
mouth while surrounding the mouth to ensure airtightness, wherein the closure<br>
comprises a sealing unit for surrounding the mouth of the container to ensure air-<br>
tightness; a locking unit having a plurality of locking projections hingedly connected<br>
inward to and along a lower end of the scaling unit so that the locking projections can<br>
be fixedly caught by a locking flange of the container, and a plurality of lever<br>
projections formed to protrude on an outer peripheral surface of the locking unit that is<br>
opposite to the locking projections; and a cover unit having a vertically movable<br>
annular body for surrounding the outer peripheral surface of the locking unit and<br>
including a push projection formed to protrude from an inner peripheral surface of the<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[22]	Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with<br><br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[23]	Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a container has a container body 200 provided with a<br>
mouth 210 at an upper portion thereof. An annular locking flange 211 is formed to<br>
protrude from an outer peripheral surface of the mouth 210. A lower surface of the<br>
locking flange 211 is perpendicular to the outer peripheral surface of the mouth 210<br>
while an upper surface of the locking flange 211 has a smoothly-curved surface.<br>
[24]	A closure includes a sealing unit 110, a locking unit 120, and a cover unit 130.<br>
[25]	The sealing unit 110 includes a circular top portion 111 and a skirt 112 to be inserted<br>
into the mouth 210 of the container.<br>
[26]	A scaling rib 113 that comes into close contact with the mouth 210 may be formed to<br>
protrude from a lower surface of the top portion 111 of the sealing unit 110. When the<br>
closure is closed, the sealing rib 113 is brought into close contact with the mouth 210<br>
of the container and then elastically deformed to increase airtightness of the closure.<br>
[27]	A lower end of the sealing unit 110 is provided with the locking unit 120 for fixing<br>
the closure to the container.<br>
[28]	Specifically, the locking unit 120 includes locking projections 121, which are fixedly<br>
caught by the locking flange 211 of the container, and lever projections 122 for<br>
releasing the fixed state of the locking projections 121.<br>
[29]	The locking projections 121 are hingedly connected inward to and along the lower<br>
end of the sealing unit 110. Accordingly, when the closure is inserted into the mouth of<br>
the container, the locking projections 121 are caught by the locking flange 211 of the<br>
container so that the closure can be fixed thereto.<br>
[30]	A plurality of lever projections 122 are formed on an outer peripheral surface of the<br>
locking unit 120 which is opposite to the locking projections 121.<br>
[31 ]	That is, the locking unit 120 is provided with the locking projections 121 at the inside<br>
thereof and the lever projections 122 at the outside thereof. Accordingly, when the<br>
lever projections 122 formed at the outside of the locking unit 120 are pressed, the<br>
locking projections 121 formed at the inside of the locking unit 120 are moved outward<br>
with respect to hinge portion 121a, so that the locking projections 121 are released<br>
from the locking flange 211, thereby opening the closure.<br>
[32]	The operation of the lever projections 122 is substantially achieved by manipulating<br>
the cover unit 130 that will be described later.<br>
[33]	Meanwhile, the sealing unit 110 and the locking unit 120 may be formed integrally<br>
with each other out of a resin by means of injection molding. However, the sealing unit<br>
110 and the locking unit 120 may be separately manufactured and then assembled.<br>
[34]	The cover unit 130 has an annular body 131 and includes a push projection 132<br>
formed to protrude from an inner peripheral surface of the body 131 and to be<br>
positioned below the lever projections 122.<br><br>
[35]	Thecovcrunit 130 is positioned onto the outer peripheral surface of locking unit 120<br>
so that the cover unit 130 can be moved upward and downward. Meanwhile, when the<br>
cover unit 130 is moved upward with respect to the locking unit 120, the push<br>
projection 132 of the cover unit 130 pushes the lever projections 122 upward. Ac-<br>
cordingly, the lever projections 122 arc pivoted so that the locking projections 121<br>
formed inside of the locking unit 120 arc released from the locking flange 211, thereby<br>
opening the closure.<br>
[36]	Meanwhile, Fig. 3 is a view showing a variant of the scaling unit of the closure<br>
according to the present invention. Although there is no additional lever projection on<br>
an outer peripheral surface of the sealing unit 110, the cover unit 130 may cause the<br>
sealing unit 110 to be operated in the same manner.<br>
[37]	That is, since the push projection 132 is formed at a lower end of the cover unit 130<br>
so as to be positioned below a lower end of the locking unit 120, the push projection<br>
132 pushes the lower end of the locking unit 120 upward when the cover unit 130 is<br>
moved upward, so that the locking projections 121 of the locking unit 120 are released<br>
from the locking flange 211 to open the closure, although there is no additional lever<br>
projection on the outer peripheral surface of the sealing unit 110.<br>
[38]	Reference numeral 134 designates a support projection formed above an upper end of<br>
the push projection 132 so as to protrude from the inner peripheral surface of the cover<br>
unit 130 and to support the outer peripheral surface of the locking unit 120. The<br>
support projection 134 prevents the locking projections 121 from being moved<br>
outward due to the internal pressure of the container when the closure is closed.<br>
Meanwhile, since the support projection 134 is moved upward when the closure is<br>
opened, the support projection 134 docs not interfere with the outward movement of<br>
the locking projections 121.<br>
[39]	Although the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 is substantially identical with that shown<br>
in Figs. 1 and 2 in view of their operations, they are different from each other only in<br>
that the push projection of the cover unit pushes the lower end of the locking unit<br>
directly or pushes the locking projections of the locking unit to open the closure<br>
depending on whether there are the lever projections formed on the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the scaling unit.<br>
[40]	Referring back to Figs. 1 and 2, it is preferred that a holding protrusion 133 be<br>
formed to protrude outward from an outer peripheral surface of the cover unit 130 in<br>
the present invention, thereby allowing the closure to be conveniently used upon<br>
opening of the closure.<br>
[41]	For example, when the thumb is used to press down the upper portion of the sealing<br>
unit 110 and the remaining fingers except the thumb are used to grasp the annularly<br>
protruding holding protrusion 133 of cover unit 130, the closure is opened according to<br><br>
the operations described above. Accordingly, the closure can be easily opened with one<br>
hand.<br>
[42]	Meanwhile, if a user excessively presses down the sealing unit 110 in the process of<br>
opening the closure by pressing down the scaling unit 110 with the cover unit 130<br>
grasped by the user, the cover unit 130 may be separated from the sealing unit 110. In<br>
order to prevent this accidental separation, it is preferred that the closure be further<br>
provided with a means for limiting a maximum operation range between the sealing<br>
unit 110 and the cover unit 130 upon opening of the closure.<br>
[43]	For example, referring to Figs. 4 and 5, first stoppers 115 arc formed to protrude<br>
from an outer peripheral surface of the skirt 112 of the scaling unit 110 while second<br>
stoppers 136 are formed to protrude from the inner peripheral surface of the cover unit<br>
130.<br>
[44]	Accordingly, the first stoppers 115 of the sealing unit 110 and the second stoppers<br>
136 of the cover unit 130 are engaged with each other before a deviation from the<br>
maximum operation range occurs when the user excessively presses down the sealing<br>
unit 110 in the process of opening the closure, thereby preventing the separation of the<br>
cover unit 130 from the scaling unit 110.<br>
[45]	As another example, the sealing unit and the cover unit may be provided with a<br>
stopper projection and a groove, respectively, so that the cover unit cannot be<br>
separated from the sealing unit during the operation thereof.<br>
[46]	That is, the cover unit is provided with the groove while the sealing unit is provided<br>
with the stopper projection which is to be inserted into the groove. When the scaling<br>
unit is operated, the stopper projection is moved along the groove. The maximum<br>
operation range of the sealing unit upon opening of the closure may be determined<br>
according to the length of the groove along which the stopper projection is guided.<br>
[47]	Preferably, the present invention is characterized in that the support projection 134 is<br>
formed to protrude from the inner peripheral surface of the body 131 of the cover unit<br>
130 at a position above the push projection 132 so as to support the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the locking unit 120.<br>
[48]	The support projection 134 prevents the locking projections 121 of the locking unit<br>
120 from being moved outward in a state where the locking projections 121 have been<br>
caught by the locking flange 211 of the container. Accordingly, the contents of the<br>
container are prevented from leaking out in a state where the closure is closed, thereby<br>
improving the airtightness of the closure.<br>
[49]	Next, the present invention is characterized in that the cover unit is further provided<br>
with a band portion which is formed to be broken if a relative positional change<br>
exceeding a predetermined range occurs between the sealing unit and the cover unit.<br>
The band portion of the sealing unit is broken when the closure is initially opened, so<br><br>
that a user can recognize that the closure has been opened by checking the breakage of<br>
the band portion.<br>
[50]	The band portion in the present invention may be provided by a variety of means.<br>
That is, when the closure of the present invention is opened, the relative positional<br>
change occurs between the cover unit and the sealing unit (or the locking unit). Ac-<br>
cordingly, it is possible to provide the band portion which is to be broken by the<br>
positional change occurring between the cover unit and the sealing unit (or locking<br>
unit) upon opening of the closure.<br>
[51]	Specifically, referring to Fig. 1, a tip 114 that is directed downward is formed at an<br>
edge of the sealing unit 110, while a band 135 having an appropriate thickness is<br>
formed at a position on the cover unit 130 corresponding to the tip 114. The band 135<br>
is broken by the tip 114 when the closure is initially used. Accordingly, the user can<br>
recognize whether the container has already been opened and used by checking<br>
whether the band is broken.<br>
[52]	Fig. 6 is an exploded perspective view showing the closure according to the present<br>
invention, which also illustrates an assembly process of the closure of which<br>
components arc substantially separately manufactured.<br>
[53]	The sealing unit 110 and the locking unit 120 may be integrally formed by means of<br>
injection molding as describe above or may be separately manufactured and then<br>
assembled. Meanwhile, in this embodiment, the sealing unit 110 and the locking unit<br>
120 will be described as being integrally formed by means of injection molding.<br>
[54]	First, the scaling unit 110 and the locking unit 120 arc injection-molded in a single-<br>
piece. The cover unit 130 is also injection-molded through another additional process<br>
and then assembled with the locking unit by fitting the cover unit 130 around the<br>
locking unit 120.<br>
[55]	To do this, the cover unit 130 and the locking unit 120 are located at upper and lower<br>
positions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 and then assembled by fitting the cover unit<br>
130 around the locking unit 120. At this time, since the tip 114 protrudes downward,<br>
the tip 114 is inserted while a smooth curved portion of the tip pushes the band 135, so<br>
that the band 135 is not broken in the assembly process.<br>
[56]	However, since the scaling unit 110 is pressed down with the cover unit 130 grasped<br>
by a user when the closure is used, such a process causes the tip 114 to be inserted into<br>
a hole of the band 135, so that the band 135 is broken and the scaling unit 110 is<br>
moved downward.<br>
[57]	That is, when the closure is initially opened, the band 135 is broken while the sealing<br>
unit 110 is moved downward. Thus, the user can confirm whether a container has been<br>
already opened, by checking whether the band is broken.<br>
[58]	Next, Figs. 7 and 8 arc views showing a closure according to another embodiment of<br><br>
the present invention. Fig. 7 shows a closed state of the closure, and Fig. 8 shows an<br>
opened state of the closure.<br>
[59]	Referring to Figs. 7 and 8, the closure according to the other embodiment of the<br>
present invention is characterized in that an upper portion of a cover unit 140 is<br>
radially cut out and an inner leading end thereof is directed to an upper surface of a<br>
sealing unit.<br>
[60]	Since the sealing unit and a locking unit in this embodiment are identical with those<br>
in the previous embodiment described above, the difference between their cover units<br>
will be mainly described below. Like reference numerals will be used to designate the<br>
sealing unit and the locking unit.<br>
[61 ]	The cover unit 140 includes an annular body 141 that surrounds the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the locking unit 120 and can be moved upward and downward, and a push<br>
projection 142 that is formed at a lower end of the body 141 so as to push the lower<br>
end of the locking unit 120 or the lever projections of the locking unit 120, which are<br>
identical with those in the previous embodiment.<br>
[62]	Meanwhile, the upper portion of the cover unit 140 is designed to be at a higher level<br>
than the top portion 111 of the sealing unit 110 and to have an upper edge that is<br>
radially cut out. Further, the inner leading end of the upper portion of the cover unit<br>
140 is inclined to be directed to the top portion 111 of the sealing unit.<br>
[63]	Further, the upper portion of the cover unit 140 may be provided with a holding<br>
protrusion portion 143 protruding outward.<br>
[64]	When a user presses the cover unit 140 in a laterally inward direction to open the<br>
closure, the inner leading end of the upper portion of the cover unit 140 is rotated<br>
inward to press down the top portion 111 of the scaling unit 110, so that the cover unit<br>
140 is moved upward. Accordingly, as the cover unit 140 is moved upward, the push<br>
projection 142 provided at the lower end of the cover unit 140 pushes the locking unit<br>
120 upward to open the closure, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[65]	Meanwhile, Fig. 8 also shows another embodiment of the band portion that can be<br>
used to recognize whether the initial opening of the closure has been made, wherein<br>
the locking projections 121 are moved outward in order to open the closure and a<br>
circular band 144 with a certain thickness formed at the lower end of the cover unit<br>
140 is then broken. Accordingly, the user can recognize whether the closure has<br>
already been opened, by checking whether the circular band 144 formed at the lower<br>
end of the cover unit 140 is broken.<br>
[66]	Next, a container according to the present invention is characterized in that an inner<br>
peripheral surface of a mouth of a container body has a cylindrical shape, an upper end<br>
of the inner peripheral surface is provided with an inclined surface connected thereto<br>
via an inflection edge to achieve an increase in the inner diameter of the mouth, and a<br><br>
lower surface of a sealing unit of a closure for the container is further provided with a<br>
sealing rib that is formed to protrude in an annular shape and to extend to below the<br>
inflection edge of the inner peripheral surface of the mouth of the container body so as<br>
to be brought into close contact with and fixed to the inner peripheral surface.<br>
[67]	Accordingly, as described above, the sealing rib is provided to improve airtightness<br>
of the closure, wherein if the internal pressure of the container becomes equal to or<br>
greater than a predetermined pressure, the sealing rib allows a gas in the container to<br>
be naturally exhausted, if necessary, so that the pressure in the container can be<br>
prevented from being raised above the predetermined pressure.<br>
[68]	Specifically, referring to Figs. 9 and 10, Fig. 9 shows a state before pressure is<br>
exerted in the container and Fig. 10 shows another state where excessive pressure is<br>
exerted in the container.<br>
[69]	Referring to Fig. 9, an inner peripheral surface of a mouth 310 of a container body<br>
300 has a generally cylindrical shape, and an upper end of the inner peripheral surface<br>
is provided with an inclined surface 312 at a predetermined angle 6, which is<br>
connected thereto via an inflection edge to achieve an increase in the inner diameter of<br>
the mouth.<br>
[70]	The inclined surface formed in the inner peripheral surface of the mouth 310 of the<br>
container body 300 may be a curved surface.<br>
[711	Meanwhile, an annular sealing rib 420 is formed to protrude from a lower surface of<br>
a sealing unit 410 of a closure 400.<br>
[72]	Specifically, the scaling rib 420 has a shape which corresponds to that of the inner<br>
peripheral surface of the mouth 310 of the container body 300. That is, the sealing rib<br>
420 includes a first rib member 421 having an inclination identical with that of the<br>
inclined surface 312 formed at the mouth 310 of the container body 300, and a second<br>
rib member 422 having an outer diameter identical with that of the mouth 310 of the<br>
container body 300.<br>
[73]	When the closure 400 having the sealing rib 420 is fitted around and fixed to the<br>
container body 300, the sealing rib 420 is press-fitted around the mouth 310 of the<br>
container body 300 to achieve airtightness.<br>
[74]	Then, referring to Fig. 10, if an internal pressure equal to or greater than a pre-<br>
determined pressure is produced in the container, the sealing unit 410 of the closure is<br>
elastically deformed to be upward convex due to the internal pressure, and the scaling<br>
rib 420 formed at the lower portion of the scaling unit 410 is moved upward and simul-<br>
taneously spaced apart from a wall surface of the mouth 310 of the container, resulting<br>
in a gap created between the sealing rib 420 and the wall surface of the mouth 310 so<br>
that a gas in the container can be exhausted to the outside through the gap.<br>
[751	If the internal pressure in the container is decreased after the gas in the container is<br><br>
exhausted to the outside, the scaling unit 410 of the closure is returned to its original<br>
state and the sealing rib 420 is simultaneously moved downward and then brought into<br>
close contact with the wall surface of the mouth 310 to achieve airtightness.<br><br>
