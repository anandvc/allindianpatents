Description<br>
FLANGE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a flange; and more particularly, to a flange for<br>
connecting shafts or pipes facing one another.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A flange is generally welded along the circumference of the end of a pipe to<br>
connect pipes, valves and shafts together.<br>
[3]	FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view showing a conventional flange. As shown<br>
FIG.l, the conventional flanges 100 and 200 are welded on the ends of pipes 300 that<br>
face one another. A plurality of holes 110 and 210 is formed to receive bolts 120 on the<br>
conventional flanges 100 and 200 to be near to the edge of the conventional flanges<br>
100 and 200 at regular intervals. Therefore, the pipes 300 are connected through<br>
fastening the two flanges 100 and 200 by tightening the bolts 120 and the nuts 220<br>
through the holes 110 and 210.<br>
[4]	As described above, the conventional flanges 100 and 200 includes holes 110 and<br>
210 formed to be near to the edge thereof for receiving the bolts and the nuts. The con-<br>
ventional flanges 100 and 200 are jointed tighter by tightening the bolts 120 and the<br>
nuts 220 through the holes 110 and 210 so as to connect the two pipes. The tightly<br>
sealed conventional flanges 100 and 200 prevent the connected pipes from being<br>
leaked although a predetermined pressure is created in the connected pipes.<br>
[5]	That is, the conventional flanges 100 and 200 must be formed to have a wide edge<br>
to form holes 110 and 210 to receive the bolts 120 and the nuts 220. Therefore, the<br>
flanges 100 and 200 must be manufactured larger to include the wider edges and it<br>
increases the manufacturing cost thereof.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[6]	It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a flange for connecting<br>
pipes which has an improved structure requiring a low manufacturing cost.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[7]	In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is a flange for<br>
connecting pipes including: a fixing flange and a connecting flange each including a<br>
pipe receiving hole having a diameter correspondent to an external diameter of pipes to<br>
connect at the center, wherein a plurality of bolt facing grooves is formed on an<br>
external edge and a nut fixing groove is formed near to each of the bolt facing grooves;<br>
and a joint fastening member for joining the fixing flange and the connecting flange<br><br><br>
external edge and a nut fixing groove is formed near to each of the bolt lacing grooves;<br>
and a joint fastening member for joining the fixing flange and the connecting flange<br>
with being faced one another, wherein the joint fastening member includes: a screw<br>
bolt faced to the bolt facing grooves formed on the fixing flange and the connecting<br>
flange and having both ends with screw threads formed in same direction; and fixing<br>
nuts screwed to the screw threads formed on the both ends of the screw bolt and<br>
having a joint protrusion formed the inside thereof to be corresponded to the nut fixing<br>
grooves.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[8]		As described above, the fixing flange and the connecting flange are pressed and<br>
jointed together by screwing the fixing nut on the both ends of the screw bolt adhered<br>
on the bolt facing grooves formed on the fixing flange and the connecting flange until<br>
the joint protrusion of the fixing nut is inserted into the nut fixing groove formed on<br>
the fixing flange and the connecting flange. The bolt facing groove holds the screw<br>
bolts adhered to the flange not to be shaken although the vibration generated by a<br>
driving machine or a moving fluid is transmitted to the flange along the pipes. The nut<br>
fixing groove enables the fixing nut to pressurize a pair of flanges facing one another<br>
with a greater force by holding the joint protrusion of the fixing nut being screwed on<br>
the screw bolt. Therefore, the nut fixing groove holds the fixing nut and the screw bolt<br>
to continuously pressurize and joint the flangesand not to be separated from the<br>
flanges although the vibration is constantly generated. Since the jointing force of the<br>
flanges lacing one another depends on the nut fixing groove, the nut fixing groove<br>
allows the flanges to have a smaller circumference. As a result, a manufacturing cost<br>
of the flange is reduced.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[9]		Other objects and aspects of the invention Will become apparent from the following<br>
	description of the embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, which<br>
	is set forth hereinafter.<br>
[10]		FIGS. 2,3 and 4 are an exploded perspective view, a perspective view and a cross<br>
sectional view of a flange for connecting pipes according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[11]		As shown, the flange according to the present embodiment includes a fixing flange<br>
10 and a connecting flange 20 for connecting pipes 40 that face one another. The<br>
fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 include pipe receiving holes 1 i and 21,<br><br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/073242	PCT/KR2005/004612<br>
fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 are welded with the pipes 40.<br>
[18]	The fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 includes a plurality of bolt facing<br>
grooves 12 and 22 formed on external edges thereof, and nut fixing grooves 13 and 23<br>
formed near to the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22. Joint fastening members 30 are faced<br>
to the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22 and the nut fixing grooves 13 and 23.<br>
[19]	As described above, the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 includes the<br>
	pipe receiving holes 11 and 21 to connect the pipes 40. These pipe receiving holes 11<br>
	and 21 are formed at the center of the corresponding flanges 10 and 20 by penetrating<br>
	the center of the corresponding flanges 10 and 20, and the pipe receiving holes 11 and<br>
	21 have a diameter corresponding to the external diameter of the pipes 40. The ends of<br>
	the pipes 40 are inserted into the pipe receiving holes 40, and the flanges 10 and 20 are<br>
	welded with the pipes 40 so as the pipes 40 are connected by fastening the fixing<br>
	flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 together.<br>
[20]	The plurality of bolt facing grooves 12 and 22 are formed at the external edge of the<br>
fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange at regular intervals to be matched, corre-<br>
spondently.<br>
[21]	Also, the nut fixing grooves 13 and 23 are formed to be near and parallel to the bolt<br>
facing grooves 12 and 22 on the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20.<br>
[22]	Therefore, the pipes 40 are connected by installing the joint fastening members 30<br>
on the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22 and the nut fixing grooves 13 and 23 which are<br>
formed at the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20.<br>
[23]	That is, the jointing fastening member 30 joins the fixing flange 10 and the<br>
connecting flange 20 which are welded with the pipes 40.<br>
[24]	As shown in FIG. 5, the joint fastening member 30 includes a screw bolt 31 faced<br>
on the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22 formed on the fixing flange 10 and the connecting<br>
flange 20; and fixing nuts 32 fixed at the nut fixing groove 13 and 23 with being<br>
screwed on the both ends of the screw bolt 31 for pressurizing the flanges 10 and 20<br>
together so as to firmly fastening the flanges 10 and 20 together.<br>
[25]	The screw bolt 31 is a bolt faced at the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22 of the fixing<br>
flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 which are sealed together with faced one<br>
another. Screw thread is formed on both ends of the screw bolt 31 in a same direction.<br>
[26]	Therefore, if the fixing nut 32 is screwed to screw bolt 31 by rotating the fixing nut<br>
32 in an opposite direction after the screw bolt 31 is faced on the bolt facing groove 12<br>
and 22, the fixing nut 32 is caught on the nut fixing grooves 13 and 23. As a result, the<br>
fixing nut 32 is firmly screwed with the screw bolt 31 and the flanges 10 and 20 being<br>
tightly jointed.<br>
[27]	The fixing nut 32 is a nut screwed at the screw thread formed on the both ends of<br>
the screw bolt 31. The screw thread is formed on the inside surface of the hollow of the<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/073242	PCT/KR2005/004612<br>
fixing unit 32 to be correspondent to the screw thread formed on the screw bolt 31 so<br>
that the fixing nut 32 is screwed to the both ends of the screw bolt 31.<br>
[28]	The fixing nut 32 includes a joint protrusion 33. The joint protrusion 33 is formed<br>
on the inside surface of the fixing nut 32 and is projected internally. The joint<br>
protrusion 33 is inserted into the nut fixing grooves 13 and 22 formed on the fixing<br>
flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 when the fixing nut 32 is screwed at the screw<br>
bolt 31.<br>
[29]	Therefore, the joint protrusion 33 guides the fixing nut 32 to be inserted into the nut<br>
fixing grooves 13 and 23 when the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20 are<br>
jointed together. Therefore, the joint protrusion 33 enhances the jointing force thereof.<br>
[30]	Hereinafter, a method of installing the flange for connecting pipes according to the<br>
present embodiment will be described with reference FIGS. 2 and 5.<br>
[31]	In order to connect the pipes 40, the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20<br>
are joined together to match the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22, correspondently. Then,<br>
the outer surface of the screw bolt 31 is faced on the bolt facing grooves 12 and 22.<br>
[32]	After the outer surface of the screw bolt 31 is faced on the bolt facing grooves 12<br>
and 22 formed on the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20, the fixing nuts 32<br>
are screwed at the both ends of the screw bolt 31. That is, the fixing nuts 32 are rotated<br>
in the opposite direction. As a result, the fixing nuts 32 are screwed in the inner<br>
direction of the screw bolt 31.<br>
[33]	Then, the joint protrusion 33 of the fixing nut 32 is guided into the nut fixing<br>
grooves 13 and 23 formed at the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20. As a<br>
result, the fixing nut 32 firmly joins the fixing flange 10 and the connecting flange 20<br>
by being guided through the joint protrusion 33.<br>
[34]	While the present invention has been described with respect to certain preferred em-<br>
bodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modi-<br>
fications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in<br>
the following claims.<br><br>
