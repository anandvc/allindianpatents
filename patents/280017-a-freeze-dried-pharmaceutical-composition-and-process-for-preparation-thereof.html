3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be formed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to freeze dried, micelle-forming surfactant free pharmaceutical formulation of anidulafungin along with a suitable solubilizing agent and acidifying agent for parenteral administration. The pharmaceutical formulation provides sufficient solubilisation and stabilization of anidulafungin thus improving the shelf life and reduces the likelihood of precipitation during storage. The invention further relates to a process of preparation thereof. <br>
<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Invasive fungal infections are a major and growing cause of morbidity and mortality in immune compromised patients  such as patients with HIV/AIDS infection, those with hematologic malignancies (eg, leukemia, lymphoma), those with solid tumors, or among  patients undergoing solid-organ, bone marrow, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or who have been exposed to high-dose corticosteroids. The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections has also changed substantially. Although Candida species still cause the majority of fungal infections among all compromised hosts, in many tertiary care institutions that care for transplant recipients or patients with hematologic malignancies, Aspergillus is also found to cause of morbidity and mortality in patients.<br>
<br>
Conventional agents, such as amphotericin B and the azole antifungals, present tolerability issues. Renal toxicity is a major concern with amphotericin B, while drug-drug interactions, hepato toxicity, and skin rashes are the primary concerns with the azole medications.<br>
<br>
Recently, a new class of antifungals, the echinocandins, has been developed. These agents interfere with cell wall biosynthesis by non-competitive inhibition of 1, 3-d-glucan Synthase, an enzyme present in fungi but absent in mammalian cells (Walsh et al., 2000; Ernst, 2001). They are used to treat a variety of fungal infections, including invasive infections due to either Candida or Aspergillus. These antifungals have shown clinical efficacy and a more favourable adverse-event (AE) profile compared with those of conventional antifungal agents. <br>
<br>
Anidulafungin is a semi synthetic lipopetide in the echinocandin class of antifungal drugs, which is administered intravenously to treat mucosal and invasive fungal infections. (Jose A. Vazquez, MD, Clinical Therapeutics/Volume 27, Number 6, 2005). Chemically, Anidulafungin is N-[(3S,6S,9S,11R,15S,18S,20R,21R,24S,25S,26S)-6-[(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-11,20,21,25-tetrahydroxy-3,15-bis[(1R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-26-methyl-2,5,8,14,17,23-hexaoxo-1,4,7,13,16,22-hexaaza tricycle [22.3.0.09,13] heptacosan-18-yl]- 4-{4-[4-(-(pentyloxy)phenyl]phenyl}benzamide)(Fig 1)is insoluble in water with a pKa of 9.46. The solubility of Anidulafungin decreases further strongly when the pH is below 4.<br>
 <br>
Fig 1<br>
Anidulafungin is marketed as lyophilized product for intravenous infusion by Pfizer under the trade name Eraxis. Anidulafungin is indicated for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, candidemia, and other invasive candida infections including intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis. Currently available formulations in lyophilized vial contain micelle-forming surfactant which does not provide a freeze-dried product with desirable characteristics due to the sensitivity of surfactant against freeze drying. The presence of the surfactant causes the freeze-dried cake to "collapse" resulting in a residue at the bottom of the vial instead of a well-formed cake. The residue is generally less stable, difficult to reconstitute, and non-reproducible. (Carpenter et al., Pharm. Res., 14 (8), 969-975, 1977 to 1997, Physicians" Desk Reference 50"' edition, Medical Economics Co. NJ (1996)).<br>
<br>
Further, Anidulafungin is sensitive to chemical degradation which limits the shelf-life of solutions in water and being insoluble in water is extremely dangerous to administer in parenteral state. <br>
<br>
Cyclodextrins and their derivatives are known generally to improve the dissolution rate of drugs and find applications in pharmaceutical delivery systems. As a "host" for "guest" drug molecules, the complexes show increased aqueous solubility for pharmaceuticals with intrinsically low aqueous solubility resulting in the improved bioavailability of the drug. The use of cyclodextrin for increasing the solubility of azole antifungals are known, however, the prior art is silent on use of cyclodextrin for increasing the solubility of Anidulafungin.<br>
<br>
In view of the poor solubility of Anidulafungin and the other shortcomings in preparing the lyophilized product for parenteral administration as mentioned above, the present inventors felt a need to provide a more stable Anidulafungin injectable formulation  which is surfactant free, enhances the bioavailability of the drug, increases shelf life and is patient compliant. <br>
<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In accordance with above, the present invention provide freeze dried, micelle-forming surfactant free pharmaceutical formulation of anidulafungin  or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof along with a suitable solubilizing agent and acidifying agent for parenteral administration. <br>
<br>
The solubility of Anidulafungin is increased by adding solubilizing agents selected from modified cyclodextrin derivatives such as hydroxypropylbetadex, sulfobutyl ether betacyclodextrin sodium, Tris buffer Hydrochloride salt and the like.<br>
<br>
The solubilizing agent is present in an amount in the ratio of 1:20 to 1:100, preferably 1:62, more preferably 1:44 by weight of the active. <br>
<br>
The pH of the formulation is maintained in the range of 3 to 7, preferably between 4 to 6, more preferably between 4.0and 5.5 using acidifying agents selected from organic acids such as succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid or inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid.<br>
<br>
In an aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of anidulafungin, solubilizing agent and an acidifying agent is freeze dried and is provided as a drug concentrate.<br>
<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for increasing solubility of anidulafungin in an aqueous solution.<br>
<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The invention will now be described in detail in connection with certain preferred and optional embodiments, so that various aspects thereof may be fully understood and appreciated.<br>
<br>
Anidulafungin is an uncrystalline powder with a pKa of 9.46 and is insoluble in water. The solubility of Anidulafungin decreases further strongly when the pH is below 4. However, it is observed by the current inventors that it is possible to provide stable pharmaceutically acceptable composition/formulation for parenteral administration or intravenous infusion comprising of Anidulafungin as the active using a suitable solubilizer and maintaining appropriate pH of the formulation. <br>
<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention relates to freeze dried, micelle forming surfactant free pharmaceutical composition for parenteral administration comprising;<br>
i.	Anidulafungin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
ii.	a pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizing agent, and <br>
iii.	an acidifying substance.<br>
<br>
Anidulafungin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is present in the composition in an amount from 1mgto 100 mg/vial; more preferably 50mg/vial and 100mg/vial.<br>
<br>
The solubility of Anidulafungin is increased using a suitable solubilizing agent whereAnidulafungin can be maintained in a dissolved state in the aqueous solution thereby preventing crystallization or crystalline growth of Anidulafungin.  The solubilizing agent is selected from modified cyclodextrin derivatives such as hydroxypropylbetadex, sulfobutyl ether betacyclodextrin sodium, Tris buffer Hydrochloride salt and the like.<br>
<br>
The solubilizing agent is present in an amount in the ratio of 1:20 to 1:100, preferably 1:62, more preferably 1:44 by weight of the active. <br>
<br>
The pH of the formulation is maintained in the range of 3 to 7, preferably between 4 to 6, more preferably between 4.0 and 5.5 using acidifying agent selected from organic acid such as succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid or inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid. <br>
<br>
Such composition after freeze drying is chemically and physically stable over an extended period of time and is suitable for intended pharmaceutical use after reconstitution with water for injection, sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection which is represented in the examples below.<br>
<br>
The aqueous intravenous composition of the invention may also comprise a physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable compound effective to render the aqueous intravenous composition isotonic, i.e. to have an osmotic pressure corresponding to that of a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride. Typical examples of such compounds are chloride salts such as NaCl and saccharide such as sorbitol, mannitol and dextrose/glucose. The preparation of isotonic solutions is well known for one skilled in the art. The diluents suitable for the purpose of present invention include 5% Dextrose, 5% Glucose, Ringers solution, Lactated Ringers solution, saline solution and half normal saline.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of increasing solubility of Anidulafungin in an aqueous solution comprising the step of combining Anidulafungin aqueous solution with a solubilising agent and an acidifying agent. Alternately, adding solublizing agent and an acidifying agent to the aqueous solution of Anidulafungin. The solubilizing agent being the pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizing agent selected from modified cyclodextrin derivatives such as hydroxypropylbetadex, sulfobutyl ether betacyclodextrin sodium, Tris buffer Hydrochloride salt and the like;  preferably Hydroxypropylbetadex. The  acidifying agent is selected from organic acid such as succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid or inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, preferably tartaric acid or 0.1N hydrochloric acid. Depending on final desired concentration of Anidulafungin, the pH of aqueous composition is fixed such that the drug is sufficiently solubilized to achieve the desired concentration before reconstitution with suitable vehicle/solvent.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of increasing solubility of Anidulafungin in an aqueous solution comprising, adding 22% solution of Hydroxypropylbetadex as solubilizing agent and 0.1 N solution of hydrochloric acid as acidifying agent to the aqueous solution of Anidulafungin.<br>
<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a process for preparation of pharmaceutical composition, in particular for intravenous infusion, comprising Anidulafungin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as the active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizing agent, acceptable acidifying agent. Accordingly, Anidulafungin or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof initially is solubilized in an aqueous solution containing solubilizing agent, preferably in the ratio 1:44 followed by addition of acidifying agent, preferably 0.1 N Hydrochloric acid  to adjust pH of solution to an acceptable level of range between 4.0– 5.5 followed by filtration from 0.22 micron filter paper. The filtrate is then freeze dried to render it sterile and filling 10 ml quantity of filter solution in sterile glass container of 20 ml vial size.<br>
<br>
The formulation of the current invention is meant for administration via the IV route, the selection of the above ingredients is done keeping in mind their compatibilities and stability during the rigorous process for lyophilization and also in terms of safety for use in patients as an intravenous injectable which is isotonic with blood tonicity.<br>
<br>
Moreover, for intravenous pharmaceutical aqueous solution to be administrable to a patient, the active ingredient of the composition needs to be dissolved sufficiently in the composition i.e. be free from visible particles.  To achieve this, freeze dried/lyophilized powder is used to obtain clear colourless solution, free from visible particles.<br>
<br>
Freeze drying process involves cooling of product at suitable temperature not less than -50°C, raising temperature to 0°C at suitable pressure of 200 mtorr to 100 mtorr in 45 hours, then at 75 mtorr, further raising temperature to +15°C in 22 hrs.<br>
<br>
The freeze dried Anidulafungin when reconstituted with 15 ml of suitable vehicle containfinal drug concentrate of 3.33 mg/ml.<br>
<br>
In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention described herein is freeze dried composition, which may also be prepared by dissolving Anidulafungin first in aqueous vehicle containing solubilizing agent then adjusting pH to desired range using acidifying agent.<br>
<br>
Developing freeze drying process for such a low soluble active ingredient needs special care and it is an art in its own way because of low concentration of solute (about 0.5%) and maximum amount of aqueous vehicle e.g. water for injection.  The freeze dried drug may be diluted with suitable diluent before administration as IV injection. The final concentration of solution may be reduced to further desired level using 5% Dextrose infusion prior to administration to a patient.<br>
<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing an infection caused by a fungus or a parasite in an animal in need thereof which comprises administering to said animal an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the instant invention. <br>
<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of anidulafungin parenteral formulation for treating or preventing an infection caused by a fungus or a parasite in an animal in need thereof.<br>
<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are administered to a patient according to a dosing regimen. It should be understood that the specific dosing regimen for any particular patient will depend on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, specific disease being treated, and the severity of the condition among other factors and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
Other features and embodiments of the invention will become apparent by the following examples which are given for illustration of the invention rather than limiting its intended scope. Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
<br>
Experimental: <br>
Several different trials were conducted and tested before narrowing down to the present formulation. Some of these trials are discussed in brief below to emphasize the inventiveness of the current invention.<br>
Example: 1<br>
Anidulafungin (active) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt was added to an aqueous solution containing pre-decided quantity of Kollidon PF 12 and stirred for some time. Solution was further sonicated. The solution was divided in to 4 equal parts. <br>
<br>
To part one drop by drop 5% citric acid solution was added but Anidulafungin did not dissolve in it and remained as undissolved particles.<br>
<br>
To second part drop by drop 5% Tartaric acid solution was added but Anidulafungin did not dissolve in it and remained as undissolved particles.<br>
<br>
To third part drop by drop 5% Acetic acid solution was added but Anidulafungin did not dissolve in it and remained as undissolved particles.<br>
<br>
To fourth part drop by drop 1% Hydrochloric acid solution was added but Anidulafungin did not dissolve in it and remained as undissolved particles.<br>
<br>
Since product showed undissolved particles, no further testing was done.<br>
<br>
Example: 2<br>
In another trial, Anidulafungin (active) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt was added to an aqueous solution containing pre-decided quantity of Kollidon PF 12 and stirred for some time. Solution was further sonicated. To this solution 1% sodium hydroxide solution was added drop wise but the resulting clear solution changed color and assay of active went down and out of specifications when measured by spectrophotometer.<br>
Assay: 15.75%<br>
<br>
Example: 3<br>
To a 2% solution of Tris buffer hydrochloride salt in water, calculated quantity of Anidulafungin was added, Suspension was sonicated.<br>
It was divided into two parts.<br>
To part one drop by drop 0.1N Hydrochloric acid solution was added to observe if Anidulafungin dissolved. Only, minor quantity of Anidulafungin remained as undissolved particles.<br>
<br>
To Second part drop by drop 1N sodium hydroxide solution was added which dissolved Anidulafungin  at pH 10 but it rendered solution colored and assay of active went down to 10% measured on spectrophotometer.<br>
<br>
Example: 4<br>
In Anidulafungin plus water, 1 -50 times (weight of Anidulafungin) powder of Disodium phosphate was added but the active remained partially insoluble and rendered the solution coloured. <br>
So no assay was done.<br>
<br>
Example: 5<br>
In Anidulafungin plus water, 1-20% Tris buffer was added drop wise but the active remained insoluble.<br>
So no assay was done.<br>
<br>
Example: 6<br>
In Anidulafungin plus water, 1% Trisodium citrate solution was added drop wise but the active remained insoluble.<br>
So no assay was done.<br>
<br>
Example: 7<br>
In Anidulafungin plus water, 1-2% kollidon PF 12 solution was added drop wise but the active remained insoluble.<br>
So no assay was done.<br>
<br>
Example: 8<br>
Like -wise other pre-formulation trials were checked with organic alkaline agent like either mono ethanolamine or triethanolamine and it was observed that the products were either getting solubilized partly or forming colored solution or assay was getting reduced to 10 to 15%. <br>
<br>
Example 9: <br>
Suitable trial was done using micelle forming surfactant like Polysorbate 80 to dissolve active product Anidulafungin in aqueous base along with suitable acidifying agent like tartaric acid and isotonic agent like mannitol, to check and compare solubility and stability of liquid preparation. Accordingly following process was followed:<br>
