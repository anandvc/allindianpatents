				<td>SCROLL MACHINE WITH CONTINUOUS CAPACITY MODULATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to scroll compressors and more<br>
specifically to continuous capacity modulation systems of the delayed suction type for<br>
such compressors.<br>
Utility summer peak demand limit control has historically been the driving<br>
demand behind the need for load shedding for refrigeration compressors. The<br>
traditional method used for load shedding has been to have the room thermostat<br>
perform an on/off duty cycle of the air conditioning system in the order of every 15<br>
minutes. The disadvantages to this method are that the control and communication<br>
hardware cost to implement this system is higher than the savings from demand-side<br>
management, and the comfort provided by the system is diminished with long off cycles.<br>
Another approach that utilities are using is variable speed air conditioning systems that<br>
can modulate capacity and power continuously down to about 75% 30% of capacity.<br>
However, not only are variable speed inverters expensive, they also reduce power<br>
supply quality through harmonics thus defeating the utilities original interest. A two-step<br>
compressor using a two-speed or a reversing motor is another option but these systems<br>
have limited capability because the motor has to be shut down for 1-2 minutes between<br>
speed changes to assure reliability. One possibility to accomplish this load shedding<br>
is to utilize a capacity modulated compressor.<br>
A wide variety of systems have been developed in order to accomplish capacity<br>
modulation for refrigerant compressors, most of which delay the initial sealing point of<br>
the moving fluid pockets defined by the scroll members. In one form, such systems<br><br>
commonly employ a pair of vent passages communicating between suction pressure<br>
and the outermost pair of moving fluid pockets. Typically these passages open into the<br>
moving fluid pockets at a position within 360Â° of the sealing point of the outer ends of<br>
the wraps. Some systems employ a separate valve member for each of these vent<br>
passages. The valve members are intended to be operated simultaneously so as to<br>
ensure a pressure balance between the two fluid pockets. Other systems employ<br>
additional passages to place the two vent passages in fluid communication thereby<br>
enabling use of a single valve to control capacity modulation.<br>
Most recently a capacity modulation system for scroll compressors of the<br>
delayed suction type has been developed in which a valving ring is movably supported<br>
on the non-orbiting scroll member. An actuating piston is provided which operates to<br>
rotate the valving ring relative to the non-orbiting scroll member to thereby selectively<br>
open and close one or more vent passages which communicate with selective ones of<br>
the moving fluid pockets to thereby vent the pockets to suction. A scroll-type<br>
compressor incorporating this type of capacity modulation system is disclosed in United<br>
States Letters Patent No. 5,678,985 and 6.123,517, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated by reference. In these capacity modulation systems, the actuating piston<br>
is operated by fluid pressure controlled by a solenoid valve. In one version of this<br>
design, me solenoid valve and fluid pressure supply and vent lines are positioned<br>
externally of the compressor shell. In another version of this design, the solenoid valve<br>
is positioned externally of the compressor shell but the fluid pressure supply and vent<br>
lines are positioned internally of the compressor shell.<br>
The object of this invention is to solve the dilemma between demand limit control<br>
and the comfort and reliability of the system. The above discussed capacity modulated<br>
systems provide a two-step scroll compressor that can be unloaded to operate at<br>
approximately 65% of capacity using a solenoid mechanism. This solenoid mechanism<br>
can be activated by the room thermostat directly or it can be activated by a system<br><br>
control module. The low-capacity state, while being referred to as approximately 65%,<br>
can actually be designed to be a different percentage if desired. The solenoid is<br>
capable of being "switched on the fly" reliably thus offering continuous capacity control<br>
between the low-capacity (i.e., 65%) and full capacity (100%) by pulse width modulation<br>
control thereby providing a good balance between peak demand reduction and comfort.<br>
The control solution of the present invention consists of a two-step compressor<br>
with its integral unloading solenoid and a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) control module<br>
with software logic which controls the duty-cycle of the solenoid based on an external<br>
utility communication signal, a thermostat signal and the outdoor ambient temperature.<br>
The duty-cycle can also be controlled based on a load sensor which can be either a<br>
temperature, a pressure, a voltage sensor or a current sensor located within the A/C<br>
system which provides an indication of the max-load operating condition of the<br>
compressor. The compressor motor remains energized continuously during the duty<br>
cycling of the solenoid. Additionally, the evaporator and condensor fan speeds can also<br>
be reduced accordingly in proportion to the compressor duty cycle to maximize comfort<br>
and system sufficiency.<br>
Additional advantages and features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the subsequent description and the appended claims taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description nf the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate like<br>
or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1, a<br>
hermatic refrigeration compressor of the scroll type indicated generally at 10<br>
incorporating a continuous capacity modulation system in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
Compressor 10 is generally of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,767,293<br>
issued August 30, 1988 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application<br>
the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Compressor 10 includes<br>
a hermetically sealed outer shell 12 within which is disposed orbiting and non-orbiting<br>
scroll members 14 and 16 each of which include upstanding interleaved spiral wraps 18<br>
and 20 which define moving fluid pockets 22, 24 which progressively decrease in size<br>
as they move inwardly from the outer periphery of the scroll members 14 and 16.<br>
A main bearing housing 26 is provided which is supported by outer shell 12 and<br>
which in turn movably supports orbiting scroll member 14 for relative orbital movement<br>
with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 16. Non-orbiting scroll member 16 is<br>
supported by and secured to main bearing housing 26 for limited axial movement with<br>
respect thereto in a suitable manner such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,407,335<br>
issued April 18,1995 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
A drive shaft 28 is rotatably supported by main bearing housing 26 and includes<br>
an eccentric pin 30 at the upper end thereof drivingly connected to orbiting scroll<br>
member 14. A motor rotor 32 is secured to the lower end of drive shaft 28 and<br>
cooperates with a stator 34 supported by outer shell 12 to rotatably drive shaft 28.<br>
Outer shell 12 includes a muffler plate 36 which divides the interior thereof into<br>
a first lower chamber 38 at substantially suction pressure and an upper chamber 40 at<br>
discharge pressure. A suction inlet 42 is provided opening into lower chamber 38 for<br><br>
supplying refrigerant for compression and a discharge outlet 44 is provided from<br>
discharge chamber 40 to direct compressed refrigerant to the refrigeration system.<br>
As thus far described, scroll compressor 12 is typical of such scroll-type<br>
refrigeration compressors. In operation, suction gas directed to lower chamber 38 via<br>
suction inlet 42 is drawn into the moving fluid pockets 22 and 24 as orbiting scroll<br>
member 14 orbits with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 16. As the moving fluid<br>
pockets 22 and 24 move inwardly, this suction gas is compressed and subsequently<br>
discharged into discharge chamber 40 via a center discharge passage 46 in non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 16 and discharge opening 48 in muffler plate 36. Compressed refrigerant<br>
is then supplied to the refrigeration system via discharge outlet 44.<br>
In selecting a refrigeration compressor for a particular application, one would<br>
normally choose a compressor having sufficient capacity to provide adequate refrigerant<br>
flow for the most adverse operating conditions to be anticipated for that application and<br>
may select a slightly larger capacity to provide an extra margin of safety. However,<br>
such "worst case" adverse conditions are rarely encountered during actual operation<br>
and thus this excess capacity of the compressor results in operation of the compressor<br>
under lightly loaded conditions for a high percentage of its operating time. Such<br>
operation results in reducing overall operating efficiency of the system. Accordingly, in<br>
order to improve the overall operating efficiency under generally encountered operating<br>
conditions while still enabling the refrigeration compressor to accommodate the "worst<br>
case" operating conditions, compressor 10 is provided with a continuous capacity<br>
modulation system. The continuous capacity modulation system allows the compressor<br>
to meet the limit controls and load shedding that have been demanded by the utility<br>
summer peak requirements.<br>
The continuous capacity modulation system includes an annular valving ring 50<br>
movably mounted on non-orbiting scroll member 16, an actuating assembly 52<br><br>
supported within shell 12 and a control system 54 for controlling operation of the<br>
actuating assembly.<br>
As best seen with reference to Figures 2 and 5 through 7, valving ring 50<br>
comprises a generally circularly shaped main body portion 56 having a pair of<br>
substantially diametrically opposed radially inwardly extending protrusions 58 and 60<br>
provided thereon of substantially identical predetermined axial and circumferential<br>
dimensions. Suitable substantially identical circumferentially extending guide surfaces<br>
62, 64 and 66, 68 are provided adjacent axially opposite sides of protrusions 58 and 60,<br>
respectively. Additionally, two pairs of substantially identical circumferentially extending<br>
axially spaced guide surfaces 70, 72 and 74, 76 are provided on main body 56 being<br>
positioned in substantially diametrically opposed relationship to each other and spaced<br>
circumferentially approximately 90Â° from respective protrusions 58 and 60. As shown,<br>
guide surfaces 72 and 74 project radially inwardly slightly from main body 56 as do<br>
guide surfaces 62 and 66. Preferably, guide surfaces 72, 74 and 62, 66 are all axially<br>
aligned and lie along the periphery of a circle of a radius slightly less than the radius of<br>
main body 56. Similarly, guide surfaces 70 and 76 project radially inwardly slightly from<br>
main body 56 as do guide surfaces 64 and 68 with which they are preferably axially<br>
aligned. Also surfaces 70, 76 and 64, 68 lie along the periphery of a circle of a radius<br>
slightly less than the radius of main body 56 and preferably substantially equal to the<br>
radius of the circle along which surfaces 72, 74 and 62, 66 lie. Main body 56 also<br>
includes a circumferentially extending stepped portion 78 which includes an axially<br>
extending circumferentially facing stop surface 79 at one end. Step portion 78 is<br>
positioned between protrusion 60 and guide surfaces 70, 72. A pin member 80 is also<br>
provided extending axially upwardly adjacent one end of stepped portion 78. Valving<br>
ring 50 may be fabricated from a suitable metal such as aluminum or alternatively may<br>
be formed from a suitable polymeric composition and pin 80 may be either pressed into<br>
a suitable opening provided therein or integrally formed therewith.<br><br>
As previously mentioned, valving ring 50 is designed to be movably mounted on<br>
non-orbiting scroll member 16. In order to accommodate valving ring 50, non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 16 includes a radially outwardly facing cylindrical sidewall portion 82<br>
thereon having an annular groove 84 formed therein adjacent the upper end thereof.<br>
In order to enable valving ring 50 to be assembled to non-orbiting scroll member 16, a<br>
pair of diametrically opposed substantially identical radially inwardly extending notches<br>
86 and 88 are provided in non-orbiting scroll member 16 each opening into groove 84<br>
as best seen with reference to Figure 3. Notches 86 and 88 have a circumferentially<br>
extending dimension slightly larger than the circumferential extent of protrusions 58 and<br>
60 on valving ring 50.<br>
Groove 84 is sized to movably accommodate protrusions 58 and 60 when<br>
valving ring is assembled thereto and notches 86 and 88 are sized to enable protrusions<br>
58 and 60 to be moved into groove 84. Additionally, cylindrical portion 82 will have a<br>
diameter such that guide surfaces 62,64,66,68,70, 72, 74 and 76 will slidingly support<br>
rotary movement of valving ring 50 with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 16.<br>
Non-orbiting scroll member 16 also includes a pair of generally diametrically<br>
opposed radially extending passages 90 and 92 opening into the inner surface of groove<br>
84 and extending generally radially inwardly through the end plate of non-orbiting scroll<br>
member 16. An axially extending passage 94 places the inner end of passage 90 in<br>
fluid communication with moving fluid pocket 22 while a second axially extending<br>
passage 96 places the inner end of passage 92 in fluid communication with moving fluid<br>
pocket 24. Preferably, passages 94 and 96 will be oval in shape so as to maximize the<br>
size of the opening thereof without having a width greater than the width of the wrap of<br>
the orbiting scroll member 14. Passage 94 is positioned adjacent an inner sidewall<br>
surface of scroll wrap 20 and passage 96 is positioned adjacent an outer sidewall<br>
surface of wrap 20. Alternatively passages 94 and 96 may be round if desired however<br><br>
the diameter thereof should be such that the opening does not extend to the radially<br>
inner side of the orbiting scroll member 14 as it passes thereover.<br>
As best seen with reference to Figure 9, actuating assembly 52 includes a piston<br>
and cylinder assembly 98 and a return spring assembly 99. Piston and cylinder<br>
assembly 98 includes a housing 100 having a bore defining a cylinder 104 extending<br>
inwardly from one end thereof and within which a piston 106 is movably disposed. An<br>
outer end 107 of piston 106 projects axially outwardly from one end of housing 100 and<br>
includes an elongated or oval-shaped opening 108 therein adapted to receive pin 80<br>
forming a part of valving ring 50. Elongated or oval opening 108 is designed to<br>
accommodate the arcuate movement of pin 80 relative to the linear movement of piston<br>
end 107 during operation. A depending portion 110 of housing 100 has secured thereto<br>
a suitably sized mounting flange 112 which is adapted to enable housing 100 to be<br>
secured to a suitable flange member 114 by bolts 116. Flange 114 is in turn suitably<br>
supported within outer shell 12 such as by bearing housing 26.<br>
A passage 118 is provided in depending portion 110 extending upwardly from<br>
the lower end thereof and opening into a laterally extending passage 120 which in turn<br>
opens into the inner end of cylinder 104. A second laterally extending passage 124<br>
provided in depending portion 110 opens outwardly through the sidewall thereof and<br>
communicates at its inner end with passage 118. A second relatively small laterally<br>
extending passage 128 extends from fluid passage 118 in the opposite direction of fluid<br>
passage 120 and opens outwardly through an end wall 130 of housing 100.<br>
A pin member 132 is provided upstanding from housing 100 to which is<br>
connected one end of a return spring 134 the other end of which is connected to an<br>
extended portion of pin 80. Return spring 134 will be of such a length and strength as<br>
to urge ring 50 and piston 106 into the position shown in Figure 9 when cylinder 104 is<br>
fully vented via passage 128.<br><br>
As best seen with reference to Figures 10 and 12, control system 54 includes<br>
a valve body 136 having a radially outwardly extending flange 137 including a conical<br>
surface 138 on one side thereof. Valve body 136 is inserted into an opening 140 in<br>
outer shell 12 and positioned with conical surface 138 abutting the peripheral edge of<br>
opening 140 and then welded to shell 12 with cylindrical portion 300 projecting outwardly<br>
therefrom. Cylindrical portion 300 of vaive body includes an enlarged diameter threaded<br>
bore 302 extending axially inwardly and opening into a recessed area 154.<br>
Valve body 136 includes a housing 142 having a first passage 144 extending<br>
downwardly from a substantially flat upper surface 146 and intersecting a second<br>
laterally extending passage 148 which opens outwardly into the area of opening 140 in<br>
shell 12. A third passage 150 also extends downwardly from surface 146 and intersects<br>
a fourth laterally extending passage 152 which also opens outwardly into a recessed<br>
area 154 provided in the end portion of body 136.<br>
A manifold 156 is sealingly secured to surface 146 by means of suitable<br>
fasteners and includes fittings for connection of one end of each of fluid lines 160 and<br>
162 so as to place them in sealed fluid communication with respective passages 150<br>
and 144.<br>
A solenoid coil assembly 164 is designed to be sealingly secured to valve body<br>
136 and includes an elongated tubular member 304 having a threaded fitting 306<br>
sealingly secured to the open end thereof. Threaded fitting 306 is adapted to be<br>
threadedly received within bore 302 and sealed thereto by means of O-ring 308. A<br>
plunger 168 is movably disposed within tubular member 304 and is biased outwardly<br>
therefrom by spring 174 which bears against closed end 308 of tubular member 304.<br>
A valve member 176 is provided on the outer end of plunger 168 and cooperates with<br>
valve seat 178 to selectively close off passage 148. A solenoid coil 172 is positioned<br>
on tubular member 304 and secured thereto by means of nut 310 threaded on the outer<br>
end of tubular member 304.<br><br>
In order to supply pressurized fluid to actuating assembly 52, an axially<br>
extending passage 179 extends downwardly from discharge port 46 and connects to a<br>
generally radially extending passage 180 in non-orbiting scroll member 16. Passage<br>
180 extends radially and opens outwardly through the circumferential sidewall of<br>
non-orbiting scroll 16 as best seen with reference to Figure 11. The other end of fluid<br>
line 160 is sealingly connected to passage 180 whereby a supply of compressed fluid<br>
may be supplied from discharge port 46 to valve body 136. A circumferentially<br>
elongated opening 182 is provided in valving ring 50 suitably positioned so as to enable<br>
fluid line 160 to pass therethrough while accommodating the rotational movement of ring<br>
50 with respect to non-orbiting scroll member 16.<br>
In order to supply pressurized fluid from valve body 136 to actuating piston and<br>
cylinder assembly 98, fluid line 162 extends from valve body 136 and is connected to<br>
passage 124 provided in depending portion 110 of housing 100.<br>
Valving ring 50 may be easily assembled to non-orbiting scroll member 16 by<br>
merely aligning protrusions 58 and 60 with respective notches 86 and 88 and moving<br>
protrusions 58 and 60 into annular groove 84. Thereafter valving ring 50 is rotated into<br>
the desired position with the axially upper and lower surfaces of protrusions 58 and 60<br>
cooperating with guide surfaces 62, 64, 66, 68. 70, 72, 74 and 76 to movably support<br>
valving ring 50 on non-orbiting scroll member 50. Thereafter, housing 100 of actuating<br>
assembly 52 may be positioned on mounting flange 114 with piston end 107 receiving<br>
pin 80. One end of spring 134 may then be connected to pin 132. Thereafter, the other<br>
end of spring 134 may be connected to pin 80 thus completing the assembly process.<br>
While non-orbiting scroll member 16 is typically secured to main bearing housing<br>
26 by suitable bolts 184 prior to assembly of valving ring 50, it may in some cases be<br>
preferable to assemble this continuous capacity modulation component to non-orbiting<br>
scroll member 16 prior to assembly of non-orbiting scroll member 16 to main bearing<br>
housing 26. This may be easily accomplished by merely providing a plurality of suitably<br><br>
positioned arcuate cutouts 186 along the periphery of valving ring 50 as shown in Figure<br>
4. These cutouts will afford access to securing bolts 184 with valving ring assembled<br>
to non-orbiting scroll member 16.<br>
In operation, when system operating conditions as sensed by one or more<br>
sensors 188 indicate that full capacity of compressor is required, an indoor unit control<br>
module 190 will operate in response to a signal from sensors 188 to energize solenoid<br>
coil 172 of solenoid assembly 164 thereby causing plunger 168 to be moved out of<br>
engagement with valve seat 178 thereby placing passages 148 and 152 in fluid<br>
communication. Pressurized fluid at substantially discharge pressure will then be<br>
allowed to flow from discharge port 46 to cylinder 104 via passages 179,180, fluid line<br>
160, passages 150,152,148,144, fluid line 162 and passages 124,118 and 120. This<br>
fluid pressure will then cause piston 106 to move outwardly with respect to cylinder 104<br>
thereby rotating valving ring so as to move protrusions 58 and 60 into sealing overlying<br>
relationship to passages 90 and 92. This will then prevent suction gas drawn into the<br>
moving fluid pockets defined by interengaging scroll members 14 and 16 from being<br>
exhausted or vented through passages 90 and 92.<br>
When the load conditions change to the point that the full capacity of compressor<br>
10 is not required, sensors 188 will provide a signal indicative thereof to controller 190<br>
which in turn will deenergize coil 172 of solenoid assembly 164. Plunger 168 will then<br>
move outwardly from tubular member 304 under the biasing action of spring 174<br>
thereby moving valve 176 into sealing engagement with seat 178 thus closing of<br>
passage 148 and the flow of pressurized fluid therethrough. It is noted that recess 154<br>
will be in continuous fluid communication with discharge port 46 and hence continuously<br>
subject to discharge pressure. This discharge pressure will aid in biasing valve 176 into<br>
fluid tight sealing engagement with valve seat 178 as well as retaining same in such<br>
relationship.<br><br>
The pressurized gas contained in cylinder 104 will bleed back into chamber 38<br>
via vent passage 128 thereby enabling spring 134 to rotate valving ring 50 back to a<br>
position in which passages 90 and 92 are no longer closed off by protrusions 58 and 60.<br>
Spring 134 will also move piston 106 inwardly with respect to cylinder 104. In this<br>
position a portion of the suction gas being drawn into the moving fluid pockets defined<br>
by the interengaging scroll members 14 and 16 will be exhausted or vented through<br>
passages 90 and 92 until such time as the moving fluid pockets have moved out of<br>
communication with ports 94 and 96 thus reducing the volume of the suction gas being<br>
compressed and hence the capacity of the compressor. It should be noted that by<br>
arranging the modulation system such that compressor 10 is normally in a reduced<br>
capacity mode of operation (i.e., solenoid coil is deenergized and hence no fluid<br>
pressure is being supplied to the actuating piston cylinder assembly), this system offers<br>
*<br>
the advantage that the compressor will be started in a reduced capacity mode thus<br>
requiring a lower starting torque. This enables use of a less costly lower starting torque<br>
motor if desired.<br>
It should be noted that the speed with which the valving ring may be moved<br>
between the modulated position of Figure 1 and the unmodulated position of Figure 2<br>
will be directly related to the relative size of vent passage 128 and the supply lines. In<br>
other words, because passage 128 is continuously open to chamber 38 which is at<br>
suction pressure, when coil 172 of solenoid assembly 164 is energized a portion of the<br>
pressurized fluid flowing from discharge port 46 will be continuously vented to suction<br>
pressure. The volume of this fluid will be controlled by the relative sizing of passage<br>
128. However, as passage 128 is reduced in size, the time required to vent cylinder<br>
104 will increase thus increasing the time required to switch from reduced capacity to<br>
full capacity.<br>
While the above embodiment has been described utilizing a passage 128<br>
provided in housing 100 to vent actuating pressure from cylinder 104 to thereby enable<br><br>
compressor 10 to return to reduced capacity, it is also possible to delete passage 128<br>
and incorporate a vent passage in the valve body 136 in place thereof. Such an<br>
embodiment is shown in Figures 13 and 14. Figure 13 shows a modified valve body<br>
136' incorporating a vent passage 192 which will operate to continuously vent passage<br>
144' to suction pressure and hence allow cylinder 104 to vent to suction via line 162.<br>
Figure 14 in turn shows a modified piston and cylinder assembly 98' in which vent<br>
passage 128 has been deleted. The operation and function of valve body 136' and<br>
piston cylinder assembly 98' will otherwise be substantially identical to that disclosed<br>
above. Accordingly, corresponding portions of valve bodies 136 and 136' piston and<br>
cylinder assemblies 98 and 98' are substantially identical and have each been indicated<br>
by the same reference numbers primed.<br>
While the above embodiments provide efficient relatively low cost arrangements<br>
for capacity modulation, it is also possible to utilize a three way solenoid valve in which<br>
the venting of cylinder 104 is also controlled by valving. Such an arrangement is<br>
illustrated and will be described with reference to Figure 15. In this embodiment, valve<br>
body 194 is secured to shell 12 in the same manner as described above and includes<br>
an elongated central bore 196 within which is movably disposed a spool valve 198.<br>
Spool valve 198 extends outwardly through shell 12 into solenoid coil 200 and is<br>
adapted to be moved longitudinally outwardly from valve body 194 upon energization<br>
of solenoid coil 200. A coil spring 202 operates to bias spool valve 198 into valve body<br>
194 when coil 200 is not energized.<br>
Spool valve 198 includes an elongated axially extending central passage 204 the<br>
inner end of which is plugged via plug 206. Three groups of generally radially extending<br>
axially spaced passages 208, 210, 212 are provided each group consisting of one or<br>
more such passages which extend outwardly from central passage 204 with each group<br>
opening into axially spaced annular grooves 214, 216 and 218 respectively. Valve body<br>
194 in turn is provided with a first high pressure supply passage 220 which opens into<br><br>
bore 196 and is adapted to be connected to fluid line 160 to supply compressed fluid to<br>
valve body 194. A second passage 222 in valve body also opens into bore 196 and is<br>
adapted to be connected to fluid line 162 at its outer end to place bore 196 in fluid<br>
communication with cylinder 104. A vent passage 224 is also provided in valve body<br>
194 having one end opening into bore 196 with the other end opening into lower<br>
chamber 38 of shell 12.<br>
In operation, when solenoid coil is deenergized, spool valve 198 will be in a<br>
position such that annular groove 214 will be in open communication with passage 222<br>
and annular groove 218 will be in open communication with vent passage 224 thereby<br>
continuously venting cylinder 104. At this time, spool valve 198 will be positioned such<br>
that annular seals 226 and 228 will lie on axially opposite sides of passage 220 thereby<br>
preventing flow of compressed fluid from discharge port 46. When it is desired to<br>
actuate the capacity modulation system to increase the capacity of compressor 10,<br>
solenoid coil 200 will be energized thereby causing spool valve 198 to move outwardly<br>
from valve body 194. This will result in annular groove 218 moving out of fluid<br>
communication with vent passage 224 while annular groove 216 is moved into open<br>
communication with high pressure supply passage 220. As passage 222 will remain in<br>
fluid communication with annular groove 214 pressurized fluid from passage 220 will be<br>
supplied to cylinder 104 via passages 210 and 208 in spool valve 198. Additional<br>
suitable axially spaced annular seals will also be provided on spool valve 198 to ensure<br>
a sealing relationship between spool valve 198 and bore 196.<br>
The continuous capacity modulation system of the present invention is well<br>
suited to enable testing thereof before final welding of the outer shell. In order to<br>
accomplish this test, it is only necessary to provide a supply of pressurized fluid to the<br>
discharge port 46 and appropriate actuating power to the solenoid coil. Cycling of the<br>
solenoid coil will then operate to effect the necessary rotary movement of valving ring<br>
thereby providing assurance that all the internal operating components have been<br><br>
properly assembled. The pressurized fluid may be supplied either by operating the<br>
compressor to generate same or from an appropriate external source.<br>
Referring now to Figure 16, the control architecture 400 for the present invention<br>
is illustrated. Architecture 400 comprises a thermostat 402, indoor unit control module<br>
190, an indoor evaporator coil 404, an outdoor unit 406, temperature sensors 188 and<br>
variable speed blowers 410 and 412. Blower 412 is associated with indoor evaporator<br>
coil 404 and blower 410 is associated with a condensor coil 414 in outdoor unit 406. As<br>
shown in Figure 16, architecture 400 includes one temperature sensor 188 which<br>
monitors the temperature of the liquid refrigerant within the refrigerant line extending<br>
between outdoor unit 406 and indoor coil 404 and one temperature sensor 188 which<br>
monitors the temperature of outdoor ambient air. Either one or both of these sensors<br>
can be utilized by control module 190.<br>
Thermostat 402 is the device which controls the temperature in the room or<br>
building. Thermostat 402 is capable of receiving a utility unload signal 416 indication<br>
that a load shedding cycle is required. Utility unload signal 416 is optional and when<br>
present, thermostat 402 will send this signal to control module 190 for the<br>
commencement of the load shedding cycle. In addition to or instead of signal 416,<br>
control module 190 can be programmed to begin the load shedding cycle when any of<br>
sensors 188 read in excess of a predetermined temperature.<br>
Indoor coil 404 is part of a typical refrigeration circuit which includes scroll<br>
compressor 12 which is located within outdoor unit 406. A pair of refrigerant lines 418<br>
and 420 extend between indoor coil 404 and scroll compressor 12 of outdoor unit 406.<br>
Line 418 is a liquid delivery line which delivers liquid refrigerant to indoor coil 404 and<br>
line 420 is a suction refrigerant line which delivers refrigerant from indoor coil 404. One<br>
of sensors 188 monitors the temperature of the refrigerant within line 418.<br>
Outdoor unit 406 comprises scroll compressor 12, condenser 414 and blower<br>
410 associated with condensor 414.<br><br>
Control module 190 operates scroll compressor 12 at its maximum capacity until<br>
it receives a signal to begin load shedding. This signal can come from utility unload<br>
signal 416, it can come from outdoor ambient sensor 188 when the outdoor temperature<br>
exceeds a pre-selected temperature, preferably 100Â°F or this signal can come from<br>
liquid line sensor 188 when the temperature of liquid within line 418 exceeds a projected<br>
temperature, preferably 105Â°F.<br>
When the load shedding signal is received, control module 190 switches variable<br>
speed blower 412 to a lower speed, preferably 70% air flow and signals scroll<br>
compressor 12 to pulse between its full capacity (100%) and its reduced capacity,<br>
preferably 65%, through a communication line 424. In addition to reducing the speed<br>
for evaporator blower 412, the condenser fan speed for variable speed blower 410 can<br>
also be reduced accordingly in proportion to the compressor duty cycle to maximize<br>
comfort and system efficiency if desired. It has been found that by utilizing a 45% duty<br>
cycle at 40 second cycle time (i.e., 18 seconds on and 22 seconds off) provides<br>
approximately a 20% system capacity and power reduction. While the above preferred<br>
system has been described with a compressor which cycles between 100% and 65%,<br>
the compressor can cycle between other capacities if desired. For example, a<br>
compressor designed with both vapor injection and delayed suction capacity modulation<br>
can be designed to function at 120% with vapor injection, at 100% without vapor<br>
injection and 65% with delayed suction capacity modulation. Control module 190 can,<br>
be programmed to cycle continuously between any of these capacities. Also, while the<br>
above system has been described with sensors 188 which monitor refrigerant<br>
temperature and outdoor ambient temperature, other sensors which are capable of<br>
determining the max-load operating condition of the system can be utilized. These<br>
include, but are not limited to, load sensors 430 which monitor pressure, load sensors<br>
432 which monitor voltage, load sensors 434 which monitor electrical current,<br>
condensing coil midpoint temperature sensor 436 or temperature sensors 438 which<br><br>
monitor the temperature of the motor winding of compressor 12 within the air<br>
conditioning system.<br>
Additional options available for control module 190 would be to utilize an<br>
adaptive strategy with variable cycle times such as 10-30 seconds based on room<br>
thermostat error versus set point and/or possibly outdoor ambient. This adaptive<br>
method would balance more effectively comfort versus peak demand reduction and<br>
optimum solenoid cycling life. With the advent of the Internet-based communication, it<br>
is now possible to easily receive the utility signal by Internet. Thus, several houses or<br>
appliances within one house can be synchronized out-of-phase to achieve overall utility-<br>
site demand loading without any noticeable comfort degradation in each house or in the<br>
individual house.<br>
While it will be apparent that the preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
disclosed are well calculated to provide the advantages and features above stated, it<br>
will be appreciated that the invention is susceptible to modification, variation and change<br>
without departing from the proper scope or fair meaning of the subjoined claims.<br><br>
