REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATION<br>
The entire subject matter of U.S. Provisional application serial number 60/421,781 filed October 29, 2002 and entitled DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLED EXPRESSION OF GASES FROM MEDICAL FLUIDS DELIVERY SYSTEMS is incorporated by reference. The applicant claims priority benefit under Title 35, United States Code, Section 119(e) of U.S. Provisional application serial number 60/421,781 filed October 29, 2002 and entitled DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLED EXPRESSION OF GASES FROM MEDICAL FLUIDS DELIVERY SYSTEMS.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to medical or other devices for delivering medical or biological liquids by injection or other form such as, for example, syringes and catheters.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
There has been, in recent years, increasing concern of the safe handling of biological and medical materials. The syringe is a ubiquitous delivery device used in the delivery of such materials and, despite a number of developments over the years, their use poses a significant risk both to the medical professionals using them and the patients receiving treatments.<br>
Prior to the administration (injection) of fluids into the human body, it is clinically necessary to remove most or all of the air from the delivery device. Excessive amounts of air   injected   into   the   body   can   result   in   an   air   embolism    that<br>
1<br><br>
can lead to severe complications and even death of the patient. An air embolism is caused by the entry of a bolus of air into the vascular system. The embolism is propelled into the heart, creating an intracardiac air lock at the pulmonic valve and preventing the injection of blood from the right side of the heart.<br>
Clinicians have developed techniques to purge unwanted air from a delivery device prior to use.   For example, a syringe containing an infusate sample, is prepared by removing the typical protective female LUER cap from the male LUER end of the syringe, thus exposing the latter to the environment.  The clinician points the syringe upward and taps it to dislodge bubbles from its inner wall so that they coalesce into a single bubble near the tip. With a gauze pad positioned at the exposed end of the syringe, the clinician then dispenses the syringe plunger to express the bubble.<br>
The clinician must then monitor the progression of the meniscus (formed at the liquid-gas interface), and stop depressing the plunger just as the meniscus reaches the end of the syringe. In the event that the plunger is not stopped in time, a volume of infusate will be displaced from the syringe into the gauze pad. If the gas purge is performed on a syringe with a needle, the latter acts as a nozzle to create a stream of fluid that can, in some cases, shoot several feet. For many fluids to be infused, the expelled volume poses little clinical risk to patients or health cart; staff. However, certain fluids such as blood and chemotherapy agents can pose a serious biohazard contamination risk for patients and staff.<br>
The present invention aims to improve the method by which gas is removed from a syringe or other delivery device.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the figures la and lb, a syringe assembly is shown at 10 for controlling the removal of gaseous materials therefrom.   In this case, the assembly includes a syringe 12 having an elongate container 14 with a plunger 16 slidably and sealingly engaged thereiin to form a fluid material receiving cavity 20. The container 14 has a first outlet 22, for attaching therewith a needle (not shown) or other dispensing unit, and for delivering fluid materials from within the cavity 20 to the needle. For example, the first outlet 22 may include a LUER (a trade name) type fitting.<br>
Also provided is a gaseous material collection housing 30 having an outer wall 30a forming an inner material receiving chamber 32 with a necked region 34 to provide a first inlet 36 to couple with the first outlet 22. Located adjacent the necked region is a first valve portion 40 for controlling the passage of the gaseous material through the first inlet and into the chamber 32. In this case, the first valve portion is a valve plate 42 sealingly anchored within the housing adjacent the inlet by way of annular seal 44. As shown in figure lb, the valve plate 42 is provided with a slit 46 to form a bi-directional "two-way" valve.  Alternatively, the first valve portion may include a valve member 48 which is spring-biased against the outer wall 30a by way of a spring 50 anchored to a support member 52, as shown in dashed lines in figure la, to form a unidirectional, or "one-way", valve. The valve may be formed from a number of materials as will be understood by those of skill in the art to be suitable for medical applications, such as silicone rubber, polyurethane, and the like. The valve may also be provided in other forms, such as ball or "duck bill" type check valves .<br>
The housing 30 is also provided with a second outlet 60 having a second outlet valve portion 62 for selectively<br>
permitting the exit of gas from chamber 32 to a region outside the housing while retaining non-gaseous materials<br>
12<br><br>
within the chamber 32.  Preferably, the second valve portion 62 includes a aydroplihobic filter media layer sealingly anchored with the housing adjacent the outlet, by way of a seal as shown at 62a. In this case, the hydrophobic filter media may also be anti-bacterial with a pore size of 0.2 microns, though other pore sizes and features may also be used!  The hydrophobic medial layer has a first surface 62b facing the chamber 32 and a second surface 62c opposite the first surface 62b.<br>
The housing may also include a cowling or external housing portion shown in dashed lines at 64 which is adjacent the second surface 62c, for providing a shield for the exterior of the second valve portion 62, The cowling may have one or more perforations to provide gaseous materials to exit therefrom. The perforations may be in the form of a matrix or other arrangement of relatively small passages or, alternatively, one or more relatively larger passages as shown at 64a.<br>
The syringe assembly 10 may be provided to the user as a package including both the syringe 12 and the material collection housing 30 or be packaged and sold separately.<br>
The syringe assembly 10 may be used in the following manner. First, the syringe 12 is equipped with a needle at the first outlet 22 to penetrate a fluid material source, such as for example a patient, a fluid bearing vial, or a supply channel in a fluid material treatment device such as that disclosed in PCT application serial number PCT/CA00/0107S filed September 15,2000 entitled APPARATUS AM) PROCESS FOE. CONDITIONING MAMMALIAN BLOOD (the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). The plunger 16 is then partially retracted, causing the cavity 20 to expand, reducing the pressure therein and consequently drawing fluid materials therein. It is not uncommon, at this stage, to find that the fluid materials now in the cavity include a<br>
The first outlet 22 is then withdrawn from communication with the fluid material source, the needle is removed and the first outlet 22 is then coupled to the first inlet 36 of the material collection housing 30. The syringe 12 is then inverted and tapped or otherwise manipulated to cause the gaseous material constituent to gather at the Srst outlet<br>
22, it now being at the highest elevation of the cavity 20. The plunger 16 is then depressed into the container 14 to a<br>
13<br><br>
sufficient degree to cause the gaseous material and an amount, such as for example a residual amount, of other fluid materials from within the cavity 20 to transfer into the first inlet 36 of the housing 30, via the valve 42 and finally into the chamber 32, until such time as the cavity 20 is safely void of all or substantially all gaseous constituents.<br>
The housing 30 may then be removed from the syringe 12 and disposed in the usual manner consistent with the disposal of other medical waste. In this case, the first and second valves prevent emission of any of the residual fluid materials removed from the chamber 32 in the previous step. A needle or other delivery device (such as an IV delivery system) may then be attached to the first outlet 22 and the fluid material administered in a normal fashion by further depressing of the plunger 16.<br>
The housing 30 has the advantage that the cavity 20 can be sized to provide sufficient volume capacity to receive the residual fluid material while the second valve portion 62 is capable of emitting the gaseous constituent to the exterior, if need be, for example, to accommodate additional volume capacity in the chamber 32 for the residual fluid material,<br>
Thus, the assembly 10 is believed to provide a substantial improvement in the safe handling of medical and/or biological materials. The residual material collection housing 30 may, if desired, be configured to function as a cap when not in operation. The second valve portion 62 provides means for gaseous materials to escape the housing 30 and the first valve portion, in this case the first valve plate 42, can be configured to aid, for example, in collapsing bubbles from the fluid materials, such as blood.<br>
The cowling 64 protects the filter media (if exposed on the exterior side of the second valve portion) from damage due to contact with foreign objects. The cowling 64 also prevents the user from direct contact with the filter media, an advantage feature should a minute amount of blood or other materials appear there following use. The housing may also be used with medical dispensing systems other than syringes, such as IV units and the like.<br>
Another syringe assembly is shown at 80 in figures 3a and 3b. In this case, the syringe assembly 80 has an elongate<br>
container 82 with a plunger 84 slidably and sealingly engaged therewith to form a fluid material receiving cavity 86.<br>
14<br><br>
The container has, at its lower end as viewed in figure 3a, an outlet 88 which, similarly to the earlier embodiment, may include a LUER (a trade name) type fitting for attaching a needle or other supply conduit therewith and for permitting the delivery of fluid materials from within the container to the needle.<br>
The syringe assembly 80 has a transfer means for selectively permitting the passage of gas constituents within from the cavity 86 to a region outside the cavity. In thus embodiment, the transfer means is integrated in the plunger 84 which has at least one passage, in this case several passages 89, which extend from an inner face 90 of the plunger to an outer face 92 thereof. A hydrophobic filter layer 94 extends across the outer face 92 in order to prevent non-gaseous materials to escape from the cavity passage.<br>
The syringe assembly 80 may be used in the following manner. First, the assembly 80 is equipped with a needle or some other source of fluid material, such as a supply channel in a fluid material treatment device, as described above.  The plunger 84 is then partially withdrawn from the container, causing the cavity 86 to expand, reducing the pressure therein and consequently drawing fluid materials therein. In this case, the hydrophobic filter layer 94 may be arranged to prevent or minimize the ingress of gas into the cavity through the plunger 84.<br>
In this case, the plunger is a movable member which, through its movement raises the pressure in the chamber 86. The same function may be applied to oilier devices having a movable pressure generating member. The filtering action of the hydrophobic filter, via the passages 89, may be replaced by other openings. As a further alternative, the filter 94 may be integrally formed with the pressure generating member, in which case the passages may be incorporated into the filter material, for example to increase the surface area of the filter to improve or increase the rate at which gaseous materials are discharged.<br>
The outlet of the syringe is then fitted with an administration tool such as a needle or other supply conduit and the syringe is oriented to bring any gaseous materials therein against the inner face 90. Dispensing can then continue by depressing the plunger in. the normal manner while the gases are simultaneously emitted through the plunger 84 and the hydrophobic filter layer under the pressure exerted by the displacement of the plunger 84.<br>
15<br><br>
The assemblies 10 and 80 are particularly adapted for blood and a preferred embodiment of the syringe assembly provides a cavity capable of dispensing 10 cc of blood. Blood presents special handing constraints and the materials issed in flie assemblies, particularly in the treatment of blood as disclosed in PCT application serial number PCT/CAOO/01078 filed September 15,2000 and entitled APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR CONDITIONING MAMMALIAN BLOOD, as well as U.S. Patent 6,136,308 to Tremblay filed October 24,2000 and entitled TREATMENT OF STRESS AND' PRECONDITIONING AGAINST STRESS, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  Accordingly, the components used to make assemblies 10 and 80 are selected from materials which are compatible with blood and the so-formed assemblies are beneficial in that they prevent the blood collected from a patient prior to blood treatment, or blood collected following its treatment, from being contaminated by foreign bodies or materials, or from contaminating foreign bodies or materials, or a clinical environment.<br>
Figures 4 to 11 illustrate another syringe assembly 100 having a syringe device 102, having a syringe cavity 102a, and a cap 104. The cap 104 has a body portion 106 which is an adapted LUBR activated "reflux valve", such as those found available from VALUE PLASTICS, INC. under Part Number VPS5401036SN, and manufactured by Burron OEM. hi mis case, the body portion has one end with a LUER fitting shown at 108 and a distal end 110 to which a hydrophobic filter membrane 112 is ultrasonicaUy welded, thereby covering an aperture at the distal end.<br>
In this case, the hydrophobic filter membrane 112 may be wetting or non-wetting. The latter is preferred and is available from W.R. GORE under Part Number 267353S85-0, or from other sources such as HLTERTEK of Hebron, IL, This filter media is permeable to gaseous materials and, being hydrophobic, is substantially impermeable to liquids. Moreover, given that the filter is non-wetting, it also repels contact with liquids and<br>
Referring to figure 6, the body portion 106 includes a valve 120 having an expanded valve chamber 122 containing &amp; yalve plate 124 supported in a closed position by an anchor post 126.  The body portion has an inlet passage 128 and an actuator block 130 is slidable within the inlet passage from a lower position as viewed in figure 6 to an upper position as viewed in figure 7. In the upper position, sn upwardly directed peripheral wall 130a on the slide block<br>
16<br><br>
130 engages the lower surface of the valve plate 124 and forces it into a tortilla-like orientation against the anchor post 126.<br>
The syringe 102 has a projection 140 which is dimensioned to fit within the Met passage 128 to engage the block 130 and unseat the valve plate 124. This allows fluid to pass bi-directionally through the LUER fitting and then thereafter to disengage the block 130 thereby releasing it from the valve plate 124, allowing the latter to lie flat once again in its closed position as shown in figure 6.<br>
The body also includes an elongate chamber 144 above the valve chamber 122 as viewed in figure 6. The elongate chamber is substantially transparent and functions as a sight glass to enable the clinician to view an advancing meniscus during the purging process, as will be described. If desired, the elongate chamber may be provided with indicator markings to record the amount of materials contained in the chamber or, alternatively, be provided with an optically magnified region to aid the clinician to view the meniscus, as shown at 150 in figure 7. The clinician may also use the presence of the meniscus in the sight glass element as an early signal to stop depressing the plunger.<br>
The internal form of the elongate chamber 144 providing sight glass lumen may be optimized (smaller, larger, tapered, or otherwise formed in a non-uniform manner) as shown, for example, in figures 6a, 6b and 6c, to provide various levels of feedback to the clinician. For example, the cross section of the lumen may be varied (tapered) along the longitudinal axis of the lumen in order to increase or decrease the meniscus velocity as the sight glass fills with infusate. The external form and walls of the sight glass may also be optimized to create lens like features, to aid the clinician in visualizing the infusate within the sight glass. For example, the sight glass "walls may be formed in a manner to provide an optical magnifying function which would minimize infusate loses. Alternatively, marks or gradient lines may be added to the sight glass. Alternatively, mechanical features may be added to the device to provide better grip for handling, such as by way of the formations shown in phantom at 122a in figure 6.<br>
The length and diameter of the elongate chamber 144 may be chosen according to the viscosity of the materials, its desired capacity and the degree of control that the clinician wishes to have on the advancing meniscus. For<br>
17<br><br>
example, the longer the chamber, the longer the period of time the clinician has to gauge when to halt the purging step.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophobic filter media is of the "non-wetting" variety. However, there may be circumstances where a "wetting" type filter is useful, in which case provisions may he made to deal with wetting filters which become occluded with liquids following a gas purging exercise. Once the wetting filter is occluded with liquids, its ability to allow for continued selective gas transfer is reduced. Nonetheless, there are cases where wettable filters may be successfully used, by having an extra air input port in the chamber as generally shown in dashed lines at 160 in figure 6 which is in fluid communication with the chamber 144. In this case, the air input port 160 has a passage 162 and a one way valve member shown schematically at 164 which is movable in the passage to permit air into the chamber 144,  This extra air input port 160 allows the clinician to draw air into the chamber 144 and, consequently, into the cavity 102a of the syringe 102. This can be useful when the clinician wishes to draw some of the expressed liqu id materials from the chamber back into the syringe cavity, where too much liquid was expressed during the first purging attempt. In this case, though the wettable filter may be occluded with liquids and its permeability to air severely curtailed as a result. The extra air input port 160 thus permits extra air to be drawn into the chamber if needed.<br>
Thus, the cap is capable of gas purging a syringe or other delivery devices commonly used to deliver liquid infusions to the human body, that is while the delivery device remains safely capped, by tilting the distal tip of a syringe upwards to collect the air in close proximity to the filter media, as is shown by figure 7.  The clinician then depresses the plunger to expel collected gas, as shown successively by figures 8, 9 and 10. As the liquid level reaches the hydrophobic filter media, the plunger force required to generate adequate pressure to pass liquid through the hydrophobic filter media is sufficiently higii to signal the clinician to stop depressing the plunger.<br>
If the clinician desires to re-purge the syringe, the non-wetting version of the filter media will allow the clinician to<br>
pull back on the plunger in order draw more air into the syringe and re-purge at will. Using this method and<br>
18<br><br>
device, the clinician can quickly purge the entrapped gas without the concern of fluid escape and consequent contamination. Upon delivery of the infusate, the syringe can be re-capped with the purging cap in order to prevent<br>
utnnterided discbarge of residual iarusate within the syringe.<br>
The syringe 100 is also useful to "defoam" infusates, such as blood which can in certain circumstances arrive ia the syringe cavity with many small bubbles to give the infusate the apparent consistency of foam. The hydrophobia filter media thus enables the clinician, ia some cases, to exert relatively nigh pressures on the blood in the cavity, that are sufficient to collapse the bubbles. This can be done by dispensing sufficient infusate from fee cavity into the chamber so teat the chamber is full. Continued dispensing will cause the small bubbles to collapse and the gas, neighbouring the hydrophoMc filter media, to pass therethrough,<br>
la another aspect of the invention, once the foam buoyantly rises to flie top of the syringe, depression of fee plunger drives the body of foam into the hydrophobia filter membrane. As compression is applied to the body of foam, the individual bubbles breakdown, thus de-foaming the infusate.<br>
The cap 106 may thus be used as a syringe cap. When gas purging is needed, the assembly may be pointed upward and entrapped gas may be safely expelled without removing the cap. Once the gas has been purged, the syringe may bs prepared for administering the medical materials therein by removing the cap as shown in figure -11. The cap 106 can thus be removed without spilling its contents, smce the LUER activated valve 120 will automatically close when the projection 140 is removed from the passage, thus disengaging the actuator block 130 from the valve plate 124.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates a syringe assembly at 120 having an elongate container 122 with a plunger 124 slidably and sealingly engaged therein to form a fluid material receiving cavity 126, the container further comprising a first outlet 128 for dispensing fluid materials ftom the cavity under the action of the plunger 124. A gaseous material collection housing 130 with a chamber 132 is provided with a first inlet 134 which is coupled with the first outlet 128. Located in the passage is a sealing portion at 136 for establishing a seal between the first outlet 128 and the<br>
first inlet 134 minimizing leakage during the transfer of the gaseous material through the first inlet 134. The<br>
19<br><br>
chamber 132 has a second outlet 138 and a valve portion 140 controls the passage of gaseous material from the chamber 132 through the second outlet 138 to a legion outside the housing 130 while retaining non-gaseous materials within the chamber 132.<br>
In this case, as with an earlier embodiment, the chamber 132 provides a passage 142 for the receipt of gaseous materials from the syringe cavity 126. As with an earlier embodiment, the chamber 132 has at least a portion which is relatively narrow and may, in some cases (for example where the housing is transparent) aid in detecting the passage of the meniscus through the chamber 132.   As with an earlier embodiment, the chamber is also provided with an additional opening 144. The opening 144 is provided with a valve portion 146 which controls the passage of fluids through the opening 144 which may be used to permit either the entry or exit of fluids or air into or out of the chamber 132, In this particular case, the opening 144 is used for the delivery of a fluid blood sample to the chamber 132 and further to the syringe assembly 120 as will be described. To that end, the opening 144 may be coupled with an external fluids dispensing or delivery device or receptacle, shown schematically at 148 through a suitable fluid coupling therewith.<br>
Meanwhile the syringe assembly 120 is separable from the housing 130 to allow the first outlet 128 to be coupled with the same or other receptacle, collection or delivery device, shown at 12a.<br>
Referring to figure 12b, the valve portion 140 includes a hydrophobic media layer 152 as above described, which is held between a seat portion 154 of the housing 130 and a cap member 156 retained thereon. The cap member 156 has a free annular edge region 156a with an inner annular surface 156b whose diameter approximates that of an outer diameter of the complementary outer annular surface 154a on the seat portion 154 to provide a firm fit there between. The cap member 156 has a relatively wide first cap portion 158 and a relatively narrow second cap portion 160. Both portions collectively contain a duck bill valve member 162 therein. The duckbill valve member 162 has an annular flange 164 which is, in its operative position, pressed between an inner sealing surface 158a of the first cap portion 158 and an opposing surface 166a on a spacer member 166, which itself lies adjacent the hydrophobic media layer 152,   So positioned, the annular fliinge 164 is biased away from its natural flared orientation as shown<br>
in dashed lines to an urged position against the surface 158a.<br>
20<br><br>
As its name suggests, the duck bill valve member 162 has a pair of duck bill shaped valve flaps 167 whose free ends 167a, 167b are normally in contact with one another in a closed position.  The valve flaps 167 are operable to separate when the pressure within the chamber exceeds a first pressure level (referred to herein below as the fiist "cracking pressure"). Similarly, the annular flange 164 is operable to separate from the inner sealing surface 158a when the pressure within the chamber 132 is reduced to a sufficient degree to exceed a second pressure level (referred to herein below as the second "cracking pressure").<br>
In a first phase of operation, the valve portion 146 remains closed. The syringe assembly 120 is oriented to dTaw any gaseous constituents in the sample to a region adjacent the syringe outlet 128. Then the plunger 124 is depressed to cause a portion of the fluid material in the cavity 126 to be transferred through the passage 142 into the chamber 132 and a gaseous constituent (if one exists) in the fluid material to pass through the hydrophobic media layer 152 and into the inner region of the duck bill valve member 162. When the sufficient first cracking pressure has been generated by the plunger in the cavity 126 (and hence the chamber 132), the valve flaps 167a, 167b on the duck bill valve member 162 are separated to relieve the pressure, causing the expression of the gaseous constituent downstream of the hydrophobic media layer 152 and within the duck bill valve member 162 (as well as a transfer of other gaseous constituents from the chamber 132 through the hydrophobic media layer 152) and then through an outlet 168 in the cap member 156, following path. A as shown in figure 12b.<br>
Referring once again to the valve portion 140, the second portion 160 of the cap 156 provides a number of passages 180 for drawing atmospheric air into the chamber 132 and through a momentarily broken seal between the annular member 164 and the surface 158a, along path B, as will be described. This can be useful in cases where the gas purging function may need to be repeated to rid the syringe cavity of lingering gas bubbles, for instance.<br>
Referring now to the valve portion 146, it includes a valve element 170 which is biased against a valve seat 172 under the biasing action of a spring 174 and which is operated by the mechanical interconnection of the second valve portion with a complementary valve actuating member 178 on a mating fitting on the device 148.  The valve<br>
portion 146 is operable to be opened when the collection housing 130 is interconnected with the device 148 to<br>
21<br><br>
receive the blood sample therefrom, as can thus occur by drawing the plunger 124 rearwardly in the elongate container 122 to reduce the pressure in the cavity 126 or by pressurizing the device 148 to force the blood sample therefrom.<br>
In this case, when the collection housing 130 is interconnected with the device 148 and the plunger 124 is displaced to draw the blood sample into the cavity 126, it is preferable that the second cracking pressure exceed the pressure differential across the annular flange 164 (that is: between the atmospheric pressure on the exterior of the duckbill valve and the relatively low pressure in the chamber) during the drawing of blood into the cavity 126, thereby to avoid air from entering the chamber (and hence the cavity 126) along path B, to result in an added gaseous constituent in the cavity 126 along with the blood sample. If desired, the outlet 138 may be provided with a removable searing layer 139 (shown in figure 12b) to be present when the blood sample is being drawn into the cavity 126 to disable both paths A and B, for example to inhibit air from entering the cavity 126 when the blood sample is being drawn therein. Thereafter, the sealing layer 139 may be removed to permit gas to be expressed through the outlet 138.<br>
The second valve portion 146 is then closed when the collection housing 130 is disconnected from the device 148 thus returning the valve element 170 to its sealed position against the valve seat 172. The sample within the syringe cavity may then be purged of its gaseous constituents in the manner described.<br>
If, during the gas purging process, some stubborn gas bubbles remain in the sample, for instance, the plunger may be retracted to form a lower pressure in the cavity 126 and thus in the chamber 132, until the lower pressure in the chamber 132 exceeds a second cracking pressure limit defined by the annular flange 164 (which will depend, of coirrse, on such things as the dimensions of the duck bill valve member 162, its material specifications and the like) to draw ah" back into the cavity 126 which may be useful to dislodge the stubborn bubbles, for instance. The second cracking pressure necessary to access pathB should be significantly lower than the pressure needed to overcome the spring force on the valve member 170 to ensure mat any atmospheric air entering the chamber 134 (and thus the syringe cavity 126) does so via path B, via the annular flange 164 and through the hydrophobic media layer.<br>
22<br><br>
Thus, one or more of the embodiments described herein:<br>
1.	Minimizes risk of biohazard contamination by providing the ability to purge gas from the delivery device<br>
by eliminating unintended discharge of infusate during purging operation.<br>
2.	Minimizes risk of biohazard contamination by keeping the delivery device safely capped until<br>
administration is required.<br>
3.	Minimizes risk of infusate contamination by keeping the delivery device safely capped until administration<br>
is required.<br>
4.	Minimizes risk of male LUER tip contamination, thus patient contamination, of the delivery device by<br>
keeping it safely capped until administration, is required.<br>
5.	Minimizes impact to accepted clinical protocols for gas purging. "When used to purge, the device is<br>
orientation sensitive emulating current practice. When used as a cap, the device is not orientation sensitive<br>
similar to current caps. Its use is relatively simple and intuitive.<br><br>
6.	Provides visual feedback to clinician signalling completion of purge operation.<br>
7.	Provides tactile feedback to clinician signalling completion of purge operation by means of a hydrophobic<br>
filter membrane that allows the passage of gas but not liquid.<br>
8.	Can be used to de-foam infusates without the need for vigorous mechanical input.<br>

arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be<br>
23<br><br>
accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.<br>
For example, several embodiments incorporate a lock LUER fitting to couple the delivery device with, needles, IV lines or the like.
