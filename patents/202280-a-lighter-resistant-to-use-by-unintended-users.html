CHILD RESISTANT LIGHTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a lighter that employs an ignition system which presents increased difficulty of operation by unintended users, and more particularly, relates to a piezoelectric lighter with such a system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Disposable gas lighters are available in a variety of forms. One common element of disposable lighters is an actuator pad or lever used to initiate the flow of fuel. An actuator pad is operated in conjunction with a spark producing mechanism so that the flow of fuel is ignited soon after it commences. For example, lighters employing conventional spark wheels require a user to rotate a toothed spark wheel against a flint in order to generate a spark. The user then depresses the actuator pad, to release gas and produce a flame.<br>
Another means of ignition for disposable lighters employs a piezoelectric mechanism. In this type of ignition mechanism, a piezoelectric element, such as a crystal, is<br>
struck by a plexor in order to produce an electric spark. The spark is conducted to a location near the opening of the valve to ignite the gaseous fuel. The actuator pad, upon<br>
forced depression by a user, commences both the flow of the fuel and the ignition process.<br>
An example of such a piezoelectric ignition mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,262,697, entitled "Piezoelectric Mechanism For Gas Lighters."<br>
As with spark wheel ignition mechanisms, measures have been introduced to<br>
increase the difficulty of activation to prevent unintended activation of piezoelectric<br>
mechanisms or activation by unintended users (e.g., children younger than five years of<br>
age). One typical method is to incorporate a separate latch member disposed under the<br>
actuator pad, which inhibits depression of the actuator pad. Examples of such mechanisms<br>
are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,435,719, 5,584,682, and 5,636,979.<br>
There remains, however, a need in the art for improved mechanisms which<br>
increase the difficulty of operation unintentionally or by unintended users, and at the same<br>
time are user-friendly for intentional operation and intended user.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention a lighter resistant to use by unintended users is disclosed. The lighter comprises a lighter body or housing having a fuel compartment, a valve for supplying fuel from the fuel compartment, an actuator, an ignition mechanism, and a latch member. The actuator is mounted for movement with respect to the lighter body. The ignition mechanism includes an actuation axis, and movement of the actuator from a first position to an actuation position along the actuation axis. This movement of the actuator causes the ignition mechanism to ignite the fuel. The latch member is pivotally coupled to the actuator. When the latch member is in an inoperative position, a portion of the latch member is aligned with a portion of the lighter body so that movement of the actuator along the actuation axis is limited. Upon pivoting the latch member to an operative position, the portion of the latch member is unaligned with the portion of the lighter body, which permits movement of the actuator from the first position to the actuation position to actuate the ignition mechanism to ignite the fuel.<br>
In another embodiment, the latch member is disposed on a rearward portion of the actuator.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the actuator further includes an internal wall that defines a longitudinally extending channel adapted to receive the latch member. In one embodiment, the lighter includes a configuration which prevents removal of the latch member from the actuator channel. This retention, in one embodiment, is provided by a pair of arms extending from the actuator into the channel. In another embodiment, the retention is provided by a projection on the actuator that contacts a projection on the latch member.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the actuator and the latch member have cam surfaces for pivotally coupling the latch member to the actuator. According to another embodiment, the latch member and actuator are pivotally coupled by a pin. In another embodiment, the latch member and actuator cooperate to prevent the latch member from over-pivoting. In another embodiment, the lighter further includes a biasing element disposed between a latch member body portion and the actuator for biasing the latch member into the inoperative position. The biasing element is a spring integrally formed with the latch member, a coil spring separate from the latch member or a metal leaf spring coupled to the latch member.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the housing further includes a blocking surface. The latch member is pivotally or slidably coupled to the actuator and the latch member includes a finger actuation portion and a body portion with a blocking or free end. When the latch member is in a first position, the blocking end of the body portion of the latch member is aligned with the blocking surface of the housing to prevent actuation of the lighter by limiting the movement of the actuator along the actuation axis. When the latch member is pivotally coupled to the actuator, moving the finger actuation portion of the latch member in a first direction causes the blocking end of the body portion to move in a second direction substantially opposite the first direction. This also causes the blocking end of the latch member to become unaligned with the blocking surface of the housing. This unalignment is the intermediate or unlocked position. This permits movement of the actuator from the first position to the actuation position to actuate the lighter. In one embodiment, during the movement of the latch toward the intermediate position, the finger actuation portion moves in the first direction, which-is substantially forward, and the blocking end moves in the second direction which is substantially rearward. During the movement of a slidable latch member toward the intermediate position, the finger actuation portion and the blocking end move in substantially the same direction.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the lighter further includes a biasing element for biasing the latch member into the first position.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, movement of the latch member toward the intermediate position is caused by a portion of the pulp of a user's finger that contacts the finger actuation portion.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the latch member further includes a body portion with an upper cam surface and a separate cam member. The cam member has the finger actuation portion on the upper surface and a lower cam surface. The cam member is slidably coupled to the body portion such that the lower cam surface contacts the upper cam surface during actuation of the latch member. In accordance with one aspect of this embodiment, in the first position the finger actuation portion is positioned above an outer surface of the actuator and in the intermediate position the finger actuation portion is disposed below the outer surface of the actuator. In accordance with another aspect of this<br><br>
embodiment, the finger actuation portion is below the outer surface of the actuator in the first and intermediate positions.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a lighter comprises a housing, a valve, an actuator and a biased latch member coupled to the actuator. In the first position, the latch member prevents movement of the actuator from the first position to the actuation position. In the intermediate position, the latch member permits movement of the actuator from the first position to the actuation position to ignite fuel. A user contacts the latch member with a pulp portion of the user's finger to cause movement of the latch member from the first position to the intermediate position and movement of the actuator from the first position to the actuation position. Upon the user releasing the latch member, the latch member is biased into the first position. The latch member is slidably coupled to the actuator. In another embodiment, the latch member is pivotally coupled to the actuator. In yet another embodiment, the latch member can be slidably or pivotally coupled to a side wall of the actuator.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers are used to designate like parts, and as shown in Figure 1, a lighter 5 having an actuation inhibiting mechanism formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention is shown. Lighter 5 has a longitudinal or actuation axis L, a body portion or housing 6, a depressible valve actuator 7, a latch member 8 and a wind shield 9. Additionally, a piezoelectric ignition mechanism 10 is provided within lighter 5, as may be seen in, for example, the cross-sectional view of Figure 2.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, the ignition system of lighter 5 includes a piezoelectric ignition mechanism 10. The present invention is not limited to a particular type of ignition mechanism and various types of piezoelectric mechanisms and non-<br><br>
piezoelectric mechanisms can be used. One suitable piezoelectric ignition mechanism 1036 for lighter 1005 is disclosed in U.S. patent No. 5,262,697, entitled "Piezoelectric Mechanism For Gas Lighters" which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Another suitable type of ignition mechanism includes a spark-wheel and flint. Other recommended types of ignition mechanisms include a spark-wheel and flint or a roll and press. An example of a roll and press ignition mechanism that can be used is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,468,144 issued to Iwahori. The disclosed mechanism includes an actuator and a rotary body coupled thereto, and pressing the actuator causes the rotary body to contact a flint and create a spark.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, further details of the piezoelectric ignition mechanism 10 of lighter 5 die depicted, and the piezoelectric ignition mechanism is shown in the rest or normal configuration in Figure 2. The piezoelectric mechanism comprises an outer telescope member 12, and inner telescopic member 14. Return spring 16 is positioned between the outer member 12 and the inner member 14 to maintain a separation denoted by X between the two members. Piezoelectric mechanism 10 is disposed in a chamber 20 located in the body portion 6 of the lighter, and is isolated from the fuel source, e.g., compressed hydrocarbon gas.<br>
As also shown in Figures 4 and 5, piezoelectric mechanism 10 comprises anvil member 22, piezoelectric element 24 and impact pad 26. Plexor 28, shown in phantom, in Figure 5 and also in Figures 8 and 9, is guided within inner telescopic member 14. Plexor 28 is resiliency biased toward impact pad 26 by impact spring 30, which is also disposed in inner member 14. Outer member 12 also has end member 32 affixed thereon.<br>
As shown in Figures 6-9, plexor 28 has two lugs 34 formed on opposite sides thereof. Lugs 34 are received in longitudinal slots 36, which are defined on opposite sides of inner member 14 as shown in Figure 6. Longitudinal slots 36 guide the displacement of plexor 28, limiting it to the longitudinal direction. Each longitudinal slot 36 has retaining notch 38. Lugs 34 are configured and dimensioned to protrude beyond slots 36 and into windows 40, which are defined on opposite sides of outer member 12 as shown in Figures 2 and 7. Window 40 also has an upper ramp surface 42 and lower ramp surface 44. Thus, the displacement and movement of lugs 34 is controlled by slots 36, notches 38 and ramp surfaces 42 and 44.<br><br>
In the normal or rest configuration shown in Figures 4-6, lugs 34 of plexor 28 are being held in notches 38 of longitudinal slots 36 on the inner member 14, and plexor 28 is retained at a predetermined distance X' away from impact pad 26. Plexor 28 is being resiliency pushed toward impact pad 26 by impact spring 30 as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The bottom end of impact spring 30 abuts against ledge 46 of end member 32. The bottom end of impact spring 30 is also received by boss 48 to assist in the positioning of impact<br>
spring 30.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, end member 32 also has hooks 54 disposed on opposite sides thereof. Hooks 54 engage with openings 58 on outer telescopic member 12 to retain end member 32 in outer member 12.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 5, piezoelectric member 24 is one element in an electrical circuit comprising first electrode 64, anvil 22, piezoelectric member 24, impact pad 26, cam member 66, valve actuator 68, valve system 70 and second electrode 72. After the plexor 28 strikes impact pad 26, which transfers the impact energy to the piezoelectric element 24, an electrical potential difference is created across piezoelectric element 24. The potential difference across piezoelectric element 24 is conducted through this circuit, and creates substantially the same potential difference between first electrode 64 and second electrode 72. This potential difference is sufficient to discharge a spark across the air gap between the two electrodes. In other words, the two electrodes act similar to a capacitor with an air dielectric disposed there between. Any electrically conductive material may be utilized to make the components of this circuit. A person of ordinary skill in the art may select suitable materials for the various components in this circuit.<br>
When the actuator 7 is depressed, as discussed below, to create the spark, cam member 66 is also depressed, and acts on valve actuator 68. Valve actuator 68 is pivoted such that when cam member 66 pushes one end of actuator downward, the other end is moved upward thereby lifting valve system 70 to release fuel gas. The released gas is then ignited by the spark discharged between electrodes 64 and 72.<br>
Valve system 70 controls the release of fuel from the fuel supply. In a preferred embodiment as shown generally in Figure 2, the fuel supply is compressed hydrocarbon gas and valve system 70 is a normally open valve, forced closed by the pressure of a spring member 74. In this embodiment, valve actuator 68 acts on valve system 70 to lift valve stem 76 upward to release the compressed hydrocarbon.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 10, the actuator 7 comprises a top wall with a top surface 80, a spaced lower surface 82, and a side wall 84 joining these surfaces. The top surface 80 is divided into a lower surface portion 80a and an elevated, upper surface portion 80b separated by an upstanding ledge member 80c.<br>
The lower surface 82 of the actuator defines an opening to a chamber 83. The chamber 83 is defined by the top wall, bottom surface, and side wall, and includes a partially, longitudinally extending cavity 83a and a transversely extending portion 83b. The cavity 83a receives the piezoelectric mechanism 10. The transversely extending portion 83b receives the first electrode 64.<br>
The side wall 84 includes a projection 86 and an overhang 88. The projection 86 extends reanvardly from the back side of the side wall 84 adjacent the top surface 80. The overhang 88 extends reanvardly and downwardly from the back side of the side wall 84 along the side wall. The overhang 88 has a bottom cam surface 90.<br>
The latch member 8 comprises a finger actuation portion 92, a rim member 94, and a body portion 96. The finger actuation portion 92 when assembled overlies the upper portion 80b of the top surface of the actuator 7, as shown in Figure 2. The rim member 94 extends downwardly from the front of the finger actuation portion 92 of the latch member. The body portion 96 extends downwardly from the back of the finger actuation portion 92 of the latch member.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the front surface of the body portion 96 defines a channel 98 (shown in phantom) adjacent the finger portion 92. The channel 98 is defined so that when assembled, the projection 86 on the actuator 7 is received within the channel 98 to limit the side-to-side movement of the latch member 8 with respect to the actuator 7.<br>
The body portion 96 further includes a pivot member 100 extending from the front surface thereof below the channel 98, The pivot member 100 includes an upper cam surface 102 that cooperates with the bottom cam surface 90 of the actuator 7 to allow the latch member 8 to pivot with respect to the actuator 7. The geometfy of the overhang 88 is such that the latch member 8 is pivotally coupled to the actuator. Pivotally coupled as used in the specification and appended claims means that the latch member is coupled to the actuator in a manner that allows the latch member to pivot with respect to the actuator.<br>
As shown in Figures 1,2 and 3, the lighter body 6 further includes a blocking surface 104 which extends inwardly from the back wall of the lighter body. When the latch<br><br>
member 8 in an inoperative position, the lower surface of the body portion 96 engages the blocking surface 104 of the lighter body. Thus, depression of the latch member 8 and the actuator 7 along the actuation axis L is arrested, and the interaction between the latch member, actuator, and lighter body prevents inadvertent lighting of the lighter.<br>
The lighter 5 may further include a biasing element 106, such as a coil spring, disposed between the back side wall 84 of the actuator 7 and the body portion 96 of the latch member 8. The coil spring biases the latch member 8 into the inoperative position.<br>
In order to generate a spark, the latch member 8 must be in an operative, unlocked, intermediate position (as shown in Figure 3). A user pulls rearwardly on the latch member finger portion 92 as illustrated by the arrow in Figure 3, and causes the upper cam surface 102 to cooperate with the bottom cam surface 90 and the latch member 8 pivots rearwardly. Although the latch member and actuator are pivotally coupled, cooperation between the rim member 94 and the ledge 80c prevents over-pivoting of the latch member, as best shown in Figure 3. As the latch member 8 pivots, the coil spring 106 is compressed. Also, the body portion 96 of the latch member 8 moves out of alignment with the blocking surface 104. Thus, the lighter is in an operative or intermediate position.<br>
In the operative position, a user may depress the latch member 8 causing the latch member 8 and actuator 7 to move downwardly along the actuation axis to the actuation position. This movement depresses or pushes inner telescopic member 14 downward and into outer telescopic member 12 thereby compressing return spring 16 and impact spring 30. As the inner telescopic member is being pushed downward, tugs 34 of the plexor 28 slide downward until each reaches the top of ramp surface 44.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the continuing depression of inner telescopic member 14 compresses impact spring 30 and pushes lugs 34 of plexor 28 downward along ramp surface 44 until tugs 34 are released from notches 38. After tugs 34 are released, plexor 28 is immediately driven by compressed impact spring 30 toward impact pad 26 and strikes impact pad 26 to transfer the energy stored in the impact spring 30 to piezoelectric element 24, to thereby excite piezoelectric element 24 to create an electrical potential across same.<br>
Turning to Figures 2 and 6, after the impact pad 26 has been struck by plexor 28, the user simply releases the actuator 7, thereby allowing the compressed return spring 16 to once again separate the inner and outer telescopic members from each other, until ramp surfaces 42 align with notches 38. Due to the generally upward slope of ramp surfaces 42,<br><br>
tugs 34 of plexor 28 are pushed by impact spring 30 along ramp surfaces 42 until tugs 34 are deposited into notches 38, such that tugs 34 and plexor 28 are retained in notches 38. This is the rest or normal configuration depicted in Figures 2, 4 and 5.<br>
Once the latch member 8 and the actuator 7 are released, the coil spring 106 biases the latch member 8 back into alignment with the blocking surface 104 so that the lighter is again in the inoperative position.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates another embodiment of the actuation inhibiting mechanism 200. Back side wall 204 of the actuator 202 includes two spaced overhangs 206 and 208 which are separated by a slot 210. Each overhang 206 and 208 defines aligned laterally extending bores 212 and 214, respectively.<br>
The latch member 216 includes a pivot member 218 dimensioned to fit within the slot 210. The pivot member 218 also defines a laterally extending bore 220. Once assembled, the bores 212 and 214 of the overhangs 206 and 208 and the bore 220 of the pivot member 218 are aligned and a pin 219 is inserted there through. Thus, the latch member 216 and the actuator 202 are pivotally coupled. As discussed above, the lighter is in an inoperative position, when a portion of the latch member interferes with a portion of the lighter body. The pivotal coupling of the latch member 216 to the actuator 202 via the bores and pin allows the latch member to be moved between the inoperative and the operative states.<br>
In Figures 12 and 13 the actuator 302 includes a top wall with a top surface 304, a bottom surface 306, and a side wall 308 joining the top wall and bottom surface. The top wall, bottom surface, and the side wall form a chamber 310 within the actuator.<br>
As best shown in Figure 13, the actuator 302 further includes an internal wall 313 that divides the chamber 310 into a longitudinally extending channel 3 10a and a cavity 3 10b. The channel 310a extends through the top surface 304 of the actuator. The cavity 310b receives the piezoelectric mechanism 10 (as shown in Figure 2). The cavity 310b has a transversely extending portion 310c which receives the first electrode 64 (as shown in Figure 2).<br>
The internal wall 313 has at least one overhang 314 that extends downwardly into the channel 3 10a. Each overhang 314 includes a bottom cam surface 316. The back side wall 308 further includes a slot 317.<br><br>
The latch member 322 includes a finger actuation portion 324 and a body portion 326 extending downwardly therefrom. The finger actuation portion 324 includes a top surface shaped and configured to provide increased friction with the user's finger to facilitate movement thereof by the user. Illustratively, this may be accomplished by forming one or more ridges 325 on the top surface of the finger actuation portion.<br>
The body portion 326 includes a first or front pivot member 328 and a second or rear pivot member 329. The front pivot member 328 extends from the front surface of the body portion 326, and the rear pivot member 329 extends from the rear surface of the body portion 326. The pivot member 328 includes an upper cam surface 330 that cooperates with the bottom cam surface 316 of the actuator overhang. The pivot member 329 includes a rear cam surface 331 that cooperates with the inner surface of the actuator back side wall 308. The body portion 326 of the latch member 322 further includes an integrally formed biasing element 332 that extends from the front surface downwardly.<br>
In an assembled position, as shown in Figure 13, the body portion 326 of the latch member 322 extends through the channel 310a so that the bottom cam surface 316 and the upper cam surfaces 330 cooperate to pivotally couple the actuator 302 and the latch member 322. In an inoperative position, similarly to that discussed above, the blocking surface 320 of the lighter body prevents the latch member 322 and the actuator 302 from being moved downwardly. The biasing element 332 contacts the internal wall 313 and biases the latch member 322 into the inoperative position.<br>
By pivoting the finger portion 324 of the latch member 322 rearwardly, as designated by the arrow, the bottom portion of the latch member 322 pivots out of alignment with the blocking surface 320. This is due to the engagement of the cam surfaces 316 and 330 and the cam surface 331 with the wall 308. The upper portion of the channel 310a is flared to allow the upper portion of the latch member 322 to pivot rearwardly. Once this movement occurs, the lighter is in an operative or intermediate position, and the actuator can be depressed. Interaction between the latch member body portion 326 and the actuator top surface 304 surrounding the channel 3 10a prevents over-pivoting of the latch member.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, the latch member 422 shown is similar to the latch member 322 of Figures 12 and 13, however, the latch member 422 has a body portion 426 that uses a separate coil spring biasing element 432. The spring 432 cooperates with the<br><br>
actuator internal wall 413, as discussed above, to bias the latch member 422 in the inoperative position. In another embodiment, the biasing element can be a metal leaf spring coupled to the body portion of the latch member.<br>
Referring to Figures 15 and 15A, the latch member 522 and the actuator 502 shown are similar to the latch member 322 and actuator 302 of Figures 12 and 13; however, the latch member 522 has a body portion 526 that includes a transversely extending cylindrical portion 528 extending from the front surface of the body portion 526.<br>
The cylindrical portion 528 has an upper surface 530. The actuator 502 includes the side wall 508 and the channel 510a. The side wall 508 is configured to include a pair of arms 540 that extend inwardly into the channel 510a. Each arm 540 has a cutout 542 in the lower surface.<br>
Turning to Figures 15A and 16, when the latch member 522 is installed into the actuator 502 the cylindrical portion 528 is disposed below the arms 540 so that the upper surface 542 contacts the cutouts 542. This pivotally couples the actuator 502 to the latch member 522 and prevents the latch member 522 from being easily removed.<br>
Referring to Figures 17 and 18, the latch member 622 and the actuator 602 shown are similar to the latch member 322 and actuator 302 of Figures 12 and 13. The latch member 622 has a body portion 626 that includes a first or front pivot member 628 and a second or rear pivot member 629. The front pivot member 628 extends from the front surface of the body portion 626, and the rear pivot member 629 extends from the rear surface of the body portion 626. The front pivot member 628 includes an upper cam surface 630. In this embodiment, the pivot member 628 extends across the entire body portion 626; however, in another embodiment two spaced pivot members can be used.<br>
The rear pivot member 629 includes a central, arcuate rear cam surface 631 that increases in width to a maximum then tapers longitudinally along the body portion 626, The pivot member 629 further includes two flat platforms 650 that extend from the body portion 626 on either side of the rear cam surface 631.<br>
The actuator 602 includes the internal wall 613 that defines the channel 6lua. The internal wall 613 has two spaced overhangs 614 defining a gap there between. Each overhang 61 1 extends downwardly into the channel 610a, and includes a bottom cam surface 616. The gap between the overhangs 614 allow the spring 632 to pass there between<br><br>
during insertion of the latch member 622 into the actuator 602 without overstressing the spring.<br>
The back side wall 608 further includes two projections 655 that extend into the channel 610a. Each projection 655 includes a flat bottom surface 656. The projections 655 are spaced apart so that when the latch member 622 is installed in the actuator 602 the flat bottom surfaces 656 are aligned with the flat platforms 650 on the latch member. Thus, preventing the easy removal of the latch member 622 from the actuator 602. The cam surface 631 extends between the platforms 655 so that the cam surface 631 can contact the internal wall 608. Once installed, the cam surface 630 cooperates with the bottom cam surface 616 of the actuator overhang 614. The cooperation between the cam surfaces 630 and 616 and the cam surface 631 and the internal wall 608 allows the latch member 602 to pivot with respect to the actuator 602, as discussed above.<br>
In another embodiment, the overhangs of the actuator, and the latch member's front pivot member can include bores. A pin can be disposed there through, as discussed earlier with respect to Figure 11 50 that the pin and bores pivotally couple the latch member to the actuator.<br>
Referring to Figure 17A, the actuator 702 shown is similar to the actuator 602 of Figures 17 and 18, however, the actuator includes two overhangs 714 extending from the internal wall 713. The overhangs 714 include cam surfaces 716. The overhangs 714 are oriented so that upon installation of the latch member 622 (as shown in Figure 17) into the actuator 702, the overhangs 714 are below the pivot member 628 of the latch member 622.<br>
As shown in Figure 19, a lighter 1005 having an actuation inhibiting mechanism formed in accordance with the principles of the present invention is shown. For reference, the lighter 1005 has a longitudinal or actuation axis L, a first transverse axis Tl perpendicular to axis L, a second transverse axis T2 that is perpendicular to both the longitudinal and first transverse axis. The lighter 1005 further includes a housing or body portion 1006, a wind shield 1007, a depressible actuator 1008, and a latch member 1009. Referring to Figures 20 and 21, the housing 1006 further includes an outer wall 1010, a plurality of inner walls, such as inner wall 1012, for defining an opening 1014 at the top of the housing, a plurality of support members 1016, and a plurality of chambers discussed below. The upper surface 1012a of the inner wall 1012 acts as a blocking surface.<br><br>
The opening 1014 receives the actuator 1008 and latch member 1009. The actuator 1008 and housing 1006 are configured so that the actuator 1008 slides along the longitudinal axis L with respect to the housing 1006. The support members 1016 extend upwardly from the outer wall 1010, and are spaced apart. Each support member 1016 defines an opening 1018 there through adapted to receive a guide 1020. The guide 1020 includes two spaced, parallel side walls 1022 that are joined together by a central wall 1023. A space 1024 is defined between the front ends of the side walls 1022. The rear ends of each of the side walls 1022 include a transversely extending wall portion 1025 that defines a longitudinally extending slot 1026. The central wall 1023 of the guide defines a slot 1027, The outer surface of each of the side walls 1022 includes an outwardly extending projection 1028. The projections 1028 are sized to fit within the openings 1018 on support members 1016. The housing, actuator, guide, and latch member may be made with plastic material. However, the latch member can also be metal. It is recommended that the latch is formed of die-cast zinc or aluminum. However, the present invention is not limited to these types of metals.<br>
When the lighter is assembled, the guide 1020 is disposed between the<br>
support members 1016, and the support members 1016 flex outward to accommodate the<br>
&gt;<br>
guide 1020, Once the projections 1028 are aligned with the openings 1018, the support members 1016 return to their vertical, initial position. The interaction between the projections 1028 and the openings 1018 allow the guide 1020 to be retained within the housing 1006.<br>
The first chamber 1030 receives a biasing element 1032. In this embodiment, the biasing element 1032 is a metal leaf spring with one end coupled, e.g., embedded, to the housing 1006 and a movable opposite end. The second chamber 1034 (partially shown) receives a piezoelectric ignition mechanism 1036, The third chamber 1038 (partially shown) contains a fuel supply (not shown).<br>
The wind shield 1007 includes a top wall 1039 and U-shaped side wall 1040 extends downwardly from the top wall. The side wall 1040 includes two inwardly extending tabs 1044. The tabs 1044 are spaced apart on opposite sides of the wind shield. When the wind shield 1007 is connected to the housing 1012, the tabs 1044 are disposed in the openings 1018. The tabs 1044 secure the wind shield 1007 to the housing 1006.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 21, the ignition system of lighter 1005 includes piezoelectric ignition mechanism 1036 which is represented schematically. The present invention is not limited to a particular type of ignition mechanism and various types of piezoelectric mechanisms and nonpiezoelectric mechanisms can be used, as discussed above.<br>
Piezoelectric mechanism 1036 is one element in an electrical circuit including, among other components, first electrode 1046, cam member 1048, valve actuator 1050, valve system 1052 and second electrode 1054. The piezoelectric mechanism functions as discussed above to create a spark between first electrode 1046 and second electrode 1054.<br>
When the actuator 1008 is depressed to create the spark, cam member 1048 is also depressed, and acts on valve actuator 1050. Valve actuator 1050 is pivoted such that when cam member 1048 pushes one end of valve actuator 1050 downward, the other end is moved upward thereby lifting valve system 1052 to release fuel gas. The released gas is then ignited by the spark discharged between electrodes 1046 and 1054.<br>
Valve system 1052 controls the release of fuel from the fuel supply. In a preferred embodiment, the fuel supply is compressed hydrocarbon gas and valve system 1052 normally has an open valve that is forced closed by the pressure of a spring member 1056. In this embodiment, valve actuator 1050 acts on valve system 1052 to lift valve stem 1058 upward to release the compressed hydrocarbon gas.<br>
Referring to Figures 20-22, the actuator 1008 comprises a top wall 1059 having a top surface 1060, spaced parallel side walls 1062, front wall 1064, intermediate wall 1066, and rear walls 1068. The walls 1062,1064, 1066, and 1068 are joined to the top wall 1059. Walls 1062,1064,1066 and top wall 1059 define a chamber 1070 forreceiving the piezoelectric mechanism 1036. The intermediate wall 1066, rear walls 1068 and top wall 1059 define a cutout 1072 for receiving the latch member 1009. Inner wall 1066 also defines a cutout 1074. The actuator front wall 1064 includes a projection 1076 with a T-shaped cross-sectional shape and the front wall defines a bore 1078 for receiving the first electrode 1046. The electrode 1046 extends through the bore 1078 and contacts the piezoelectric mechanism 1036.<br>
The actuator 1008 further includes transversely spaced, longitudinally extending ribs 1078. Each rib 1078 is disposed within the cutout 1072, and each rib 1078 is<br><br>
adjacent to an associated rear wall 1068. Each rib 1078 at the lower end defines a pin receiving cutout 1080. The pin receiving cutout 1080 opens rearwardly. The actuator 1008 further includes a longitudinally extending contoured surface 1082 between ribs 1078.<br>
When the actuator 1008 is assembled to the housing 1006 and guide 1020, the projection 1076 is disposed within the guide slot 1026 so that the actuator can slide along longitudinal axis L with respect to the guide. When the actuator 1008 is slidably connected to the guide 1020, the electrode 1046 (shown in Figure 21) is disposed within slot 1027. The top wall 1039 of the wind shield 1007 retains the actuator within the lighter.<br>
Referring to Figures 23 and 24, the latch member 1009 comprises a first end 1084, a spaced second end 1086, a first or body portion 1088, and a second portion 1090. If the latch member is plastic, the portion 1090 is integrally molded with the portion 1088. The portion 1088 extends longitudinally from the first end 1084 to the second end 1086. The portion 1088 includes inner surfaces 1092 and 1094, a spaced outer surface 1096, and two side surfaces 1098. The inner surface 1092 is slanted and extends downwardly from the first end 1084. The inner surface 1094 is angularly offset from the inner surface 1092. The inner surface 1094 extends from surface 1092 to the second end 1086. The inner surface 1094 includes an outwardly extending ledge 1100. Each side surface 1098 includes a transversely extending pin 1102. The portion 1088 further includes a lower surface or blocking end or free end 1106 at the second end 1086 of the latch member.   The term "free end" means a surface of the latch member that contacts the blocking surface 1012a (as shown in Figure 21) in the first position to prevent actuation. In another embodiment, the latch member can include a projection with a free end 1106a (shown in phantom in Figure 24) that extends from the inner surface 1094 of the latch member. In the first position, the free end 1106a contacts the blocking surface 1012a (as shown in Figure 21) to prevent actuation.<br>
The second portion 1090 extends from the first end 1084 of the latch member 1009 to about the ledge 1100. The portion 1090 includes a first section or finger actuation portion 1108 that extends from the first end 1084. The finger actuation portion 1108 includes a top surface 1108a, a curved surface 1108b, and a slanted surface 1108c. The second section or medial portion 1110 extends from the slanted surface 1108c and is substantially parallel to the inner surface 1094 of the body portion. The second section 1110 ends in two transversely spaced projections 1112 that extend on either side of the body<br><br>
portion 1088. The medial portion 1110 further includes an angled surface 1118 that is disposed between the projections 1112. The latch member 1009 is shaped to complement the cutout 1072 (as best shown in Figure 22) and contoured surface 1082 of the actuator.<br>
Referring to Figures 20, 22 and 24, when the latch 1009 is assembled within the lighter, the latch 1009 is disposed within the cutout 1072 and the pins 1102 are received within the cutouts 1080 of the actuator. The latch member 1009 can pivot with respect to the housing 1006 and actuator 1008. The angled surface 1118 and the cutout 1074 allow clearance for spring 1032 when the actuator is depressed.<br>
As shown in Figure 21, when the latch member 1009 is in a first position, which is a locked or inoperative position, the biasing element 1032 acts on the outer surface 1096 of the body portion 1088. The biasing element 1032 forces the lower end 1086 of the body portion forward so that the blocking or free end 1106 of the body portion is aligned with the blocking surface 1012a of the housing inner wall 1012. Thus, depression of the actuator 1008 along the actuation axis L is arrested, and inadvertent actuation of the lighter is prevented. The ledge 1100 cooperates with the intermediate wall 1066 of the actuator<br>
1008	to help prevent over rotation of the latch member 1009 by the biasing element 1032.<br>
The latch 1009 and actuator 1008 are configured so that the latch surface 1092 is spaced<br>
from the actuator surface 1082 at the first end 1084 in the first or locked position. Thus, the<br>
surfaces 1082 and 1092 define a gap gl between the latch and actuator at the end 1084 in<br>
the first or locked position.<br>
Referring to Figure 25, in order to release gas and generate a spark, the latch member 1009 is moved to an intermediate position, which is an unlocked or operative position, as shown. A user contacts the finger actuation portion 1108 of the latch member<br>
1009	moving in a direction illustrated by the arrow A. It is preferred that the finger 1120 of<br>
the user contacts the finger actuation portion 1108. A portion 1122 of the pulp of the finger<br>
1120 comes in contact with the finger actuation portion 1108. This pennits the unlocking of<br>
latch 1009. The direction of the user's finger movement forms an angle a with a horizontal<br>
plane H. Angle a is between 0° and less than about 90° from the horizontal plane H. More<br>
preferably, a is between about 20° to about 40° from the horizontal plane H. Most<br>
preferably, a is about 30° from horizontal.   Referring to Figure 26, the user's finger moves<br>
the first end 1084 of the latch member 1009 in a first direction, as indicated by the arrow B.<br>
The first direction is substantially forward, which is toward the valve system 1052. This<br><br>
direction is also generally along the direction T2. This causes the latch member 1009 to pivot about the axis P via the pins 1102 and moves latch member 1009 closing gap gl (as shown in Figure 21). As the latch member 1009 pivots, the second end 1086 of the latch member 1009 moves in a second direction, as indicated by arrow C, that is opposite the first direction of arrow B. The second direction is substantially rearward, which is away from the valve system 1052. The second direction is also generally along the direction T2. Also, the outer surface 1096 of the body portion 1088 compresses the biasing element 1032.<br>
With the lighter in the intermediate position (as shown in Figures 25 and 26), a user may depress the actuator 1008 with their finger 1120 (as shown in Figure 25) along the longitudinal axis causing the latch member 1009 and actuator 1008 to move downwardly along the actuation axis L toward the actuation position. This movement releases fuel gas and compresses the piezoelectric mechanism 1036, thereby actuating the lighter.<br>
After ignition, the user simply releases the actuator 1008, thereby allowing a spring (not shown) within the piezoelectric to raise the actuator. Once the latch member 1009 is released, the biasing element 1032 biases the second end 1086 of the latch member 1009 fonvard until the blocking or free end 1106 is again aligned with the blocking surface 1012a, so that the lighter is again in the inoperative position.<br>
Referring to Figure 27, a lighter 1205 in accordance to another embodiment is shown. The housing 1006 of the lighter has been modified so that in the inoperative position there is a second gap g2 defined between the latch member 1009 and the blocking surface 1212a of the housing inner wall 1212. The second gap g2 is dimensioned so that with the latch member 1009 in the first position the user can partially move or depress the actuator 1008 along the longitudinal axis L. The blocking end 1206 of the latch member 1009 comes into contact with the blocking surface 1212a before the piezoelectric element 1036 is compressed sufficiently to create a spark. In this way, actuation of the lighter may be prevented by preventing spark generation. In another embodiment, this type of prevention can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the latch member instead of the housing inner wall.<br>
Referring to Figure 28, a lighter 1305 of another embodiment is illustrated. The lighter 1305 is substantially similar to the lighter 1205 shown in Figure 27, except that it has an additional rotation limiting mechanism to prevent the over-rotation of the latch<br><br>
1309, in addition to the ledge 1100. The rotation limiting mechanism includes a ledge 1310 dependent from the actuator 1308, which is sized and dimensioned to be received in cavity 1312 defined on the top portion of latch 1309. Cavity 1312 is sized so that ledge 1310 may freely move there within when latch 1309 is moved to the intermediate position. Alternatively, latch 1309 may pivot relative to actuator 1308 without transversely extending pins 1302 being rotatably received in the pin receiving cutouts, such as members 1080 illustrated in Figure 22. Actuator 1308 and latch 1309 may have corresponding contacting cam surfaces that roll relative to each other to produce pivotal movement by the latch. Such contacting cam surfaces are fully described and illustrated above with reference to Figures 1-3,10, and 12-18.<br>
Turning to Figures 29-31, a lighter 1405 in accordance to another embodiment is shown. The lighter 1405 includes a housing 1406, an actuator 1408 and a latch member 1409. The housing 1406 has an outer wall 1410 with an upper or blocking surface 1412a. The actuator 1408 includes a top wall 1413 with a top surface 1413a, a front wall 1414, an intermediate wall 1415, two rear walls 1416 and two side walls 1417. Walls 1413,1414, 1415, and 1417 define a chamber for receiving a piezoelectric unit, as discussed above. Walls 1413, 1415 and 1416 define a cavity 1418. The cavity 1418 receives the latch member 1409. The intermediate wall 1415 defines a bore 1419. Rear walls 1416 further define slots 1420 extending along the second transverse axis T2.<br>
The latch member 1409 includes an outer surface 1421, an opposed inner surface 1422, a finger actuation portion 1424, a shoulder 1426, and an extension 1428. The inner surface 1422 of the latch member 1409 defines a bore 1430. As best seen in Figure 29, the latch member 1409 further includes projections 1431 that are slidably received in the slots 1420 of the actuator 1408 so that the latch member may slide relative to the actuator.<br>
The lighter 1405 further includes a biasing element 1432, which in this embodiment is a coil spring. Referring to Figure 30, which illustrates the lighter in the first position, the biasing element 1432 is disposed between the actuator 1408 and the latch member 1409 in the bores 1419 and 1430, respectively. The biasing element 1432 forces the latch member 1409 rearward so that the latch member is biased into the first or inoperative position. In this first position, a first gap gl is defined between the actuator and the latch member and a second gap g2 is defined between the latch member shoulder 1426<br><br>
and the blocking surface 1412a. In the first position, the shoulder 1426 of the latch member is aligned with the blocking surface 1412a.<br>
The second gap g2 is dimensioned so that when the latch member 1409 is in the inoperative position the user may partially move or depress the actuator 1408 along the longitudinal axis. The shoulder 1426 or blocking end of the latch member 1409 comes into contact with the blocking surface 1412a before the piezoelectric (not shown) is compressed sufficiently to create a spark. In this way, actuation is prevented by preventing spark creation. Alternatively, gap g2 may be reduced such that basically no movement of the actuator is allowed in the inoperative position.<br>
Referring to Figure 30, a portion of the pulp of user's finger (not shown) contacts the finger actuation portion 1424 of the latch member 1409, and moves the latch member in a first direction A along the axis T2. As the latch member slides relative to the actuator the first gap gl decreases. Consequently, the shoulder 1426 of the latch member moves out of alignment with the blocking surface 1412a so that the lighter is in the intermediate, unlocked or operative position, and compresses the biasing element 1432. Referring to Figure 31, with the latch member in the intermediate position, a user may depress the actuator 1408 with his or her finger along the longitudinal axis L causing the latch member 1409 and actuator 1408 to move downwardly along the axis L to the actuated position. This movement releases gas and compresses the piezoelectric mechanism to create a spark to cause actuation of the lighter.<br>
Referring to Figures 32-34, a lighter 1505 in accordance to another embodiment is shown. The lighter 1505 includes a housing 1506, an actuator 1508 and a latch member 1509. The housing 1506 includes an outer wall 1510 with a spaced inner wall 1512. The inner wall 1512 has an upper or blocking surface 1512a.<br>
The actuator 1508 includes atop wall 1513 with atop surface 1513a, front and intermediate walls (not shown), two side walls 1517a and 1517b joined by a curved rear wall section 1518 (set apart by the phantom line 1518a). The top wall, intermediate wall, rear wall and the side walls define a chamber 1519 for receiving a piezoelectric unit 1036, as discussed above. The side wall 1517a defines a cutout 1520. The cutout 1520 includes ribs with pin cutouts, as shown in the actuator embodiment illustrated in Figure 22. The cutout 1520 receives the latch member 1509. The latch member 1509 includes a finger actuation portion 1522, a free end or blocking end 1524, and pins 1526 extending<br><br>
substantially parallel the axis T2 (as shown in Figure 32). The pins 1526 are received in the pin cutouts (not shown) in the actuator so that the latch member is pivotally coupled to the actuator. In another embodiment, the latch member 1509 can be located at another position on the side walls of the actuator 1508.<br>
The lighter 1505 further includes a biasing element 1528 which in this embodiment is a leaf spring. Referring to Figure 33, the biasing element 1528 is disposed between the housing outer wall 1510 and the latch member 1509. The biasing element 1528 forces the latch member 1509 into the first or inoperative position. In the first position, the blocking end 1524 of the latch member is aligned with the blocking surface 1512a. If the actuator is depressed, the blocking end 1524 contacts the blocking surface 1512a, before the piezoelectric 1036 is compressed sufficiently to create a spark.<br>
Referring to Figure 34, a portion of the pulp of user's finger 1530 (shown in phantom) contacts the finger actuation portion 1522 of the latch member 1509, and moves the finger actuation portion 1522 of the latch member 1509 in a first direction, as indicated by the arrow B. The first direction is substantially inward. This direction is also generally along the direction of Tl (as shown in Figure 32). This causes the latch member 1509 to pivot about the axis P via the pins 1526 and causes blocking end 1524 to move in a second direction, as indicated by arrow C. The second direction is substantially opposite to first direction. In this position, the blocking end 1524 moves out of alignment with blocking surface 1512a into the intermediate or unlocking or operative position. The lighter 1505 operates similarly to the first embodiment discussed with reference to Figures 19, 21, and 25.<br>
Referring to Figure 35, a lighter 1605 of another embodiment is shown. The lighter 1605 includes a housing 1606, an actuator 1608 and a latch member 1609. The housing is similar to that shown in Figure 30; however, the blocking surface 1610 (shown in phantom) is disposed on a side wall of the housing. The latch member 1609 is slidably coupled to a side wall 1612 actuator 1608 via the projections 1614 of the latch member and the notches 1616 of the actuator. The lighter 1605 operates similarly to that discussed with reference to Figures 29-31 except the latch is on the side rather than the rear of the actuator.<br>
Referring to Figures 36-37, a lighter 1705 in accordance to another embodiment is illustrated. The lighter 1705 is substantially similar to the lighter 1205 shown in Figure 27, except that it has an additional feature, Le^ the cavity 1710 is defined<br><br>
to extend through the top surface 1715 of the actuator 1720. As a result, the latch member 1725 has a finger actuation portion 1730 with a top surface that is substantially level with the top surface 1715 of the actuator in the inoperative position (as shown in Figure 36). In the first position, the finger actuation portion 1730 extends rearwardly and is spaced rearwardly from the rear surface 1732 of the actuator. As shown in Figure 37, in the intermediate position, the free end 1735 of the latch member is unaligned with the blocking surface 1740, and optionally the finger actuation portion 1730 is disposed within the cavity 1710 such that finger actuation portion 1730 is spaced inwardly from the rear surface 1732 by a predetermined distance designated "d". The cavity 1710 and latch member 1725 are configured so that the pulp of an intended adult user's finger may depress the finger actuation portion the distance "d" into the intermediate position, but it is more difficult for the finger of an unintended user to depress the finger actuation portion sufficiently to reach the intermediate position. In another embodiment, the latch member 1705 can be positioned on the side of the actuator. From the intermediate position illustrated in Figure 37, the intended user may move actuator 1720 along longitudinal axis L toward the actuation position.<br>
Referring to Figures 38-39, a lighter 1805 in accordance with another embodiment is illustrated. The lighter 1805 has an actuator 1810 which includes an outer surface 1812, an internal cavity 1815, and an opening, such as a bore or a slot 1820, defined through the actuator. The bore 1820 is in communication with the cavity 1815 and can have various cross-sectional shapes, such as square, round, rectangular, polygonal, etc.<br>
The latch member 1825 includes a body portion 1826 and a separate cam member 1832 slidably engaged therewith. The body portion 1826 is pivotally coupled to the actuator 1810 in the same manner described above. The body portion 1826 includes upper cam surface portions 1830a, 1830b, and 1830c. The surface portion 1830a is the uppermost portion, surface portion 1830c is the lowermost portion, and the substantially vertical surface portion 1830b extends there between. The body portion 1826 further includes a free end 1835 opposite the cam surface portions 1830a-c.<br>
The cam member 1832 includes a ledge 1834, a finger actuation portion 1840 and a lower cam surface 1845 spaced from the finger actuation portion 1840. Ledge 1834 helps prevent the cam member 1832 from exiting bore 1820. The lower cam surface<br><br>
is preferably partially cylindrical, hemispherical or conical. However, the lower cam surface is not limited to these shapes.<br>
As shown in Figure 38, in the first or inoperative position the finger actuation portion 1840 of the latch member extends above the outer surface 1812 of the actuator. Furthermore, the cam surface 1845 is disposed on the cam surface portion 1830a, and the free end 1835 of the latch member is aligned with the blocking surface 1846.<br>
When an intended user engages the finger actuation portion 1840 with the pulp of his or her finger, and depresses the cam member 1832 in a downward direction A, the cam surface 1845 contacts and slides along the cam surface portions 1830a-c. The actuation axis of the cam member 1840 is designated X. The actuation axis X is at an angle P to the longitudinal axis L. It is preferred that the angle p is greater than 0° and less than about 90°from the axis L. More preferably, p is between about 15° to about 35° from the axis L. In the embodiment shown in Figures 38 and 39, the angle p is about 25° from the axis L.<br>
During depression of the cam member 1832, referring to Figure 39, when the finger actuation portion 1840 is pushed below the outer surface 1812 of the actuator, the upper end 1850 of the body portion 1826 of latch 1825 pivots in the direction of the arrow B and the lower end 1855 of the body portion pivots in the opposite direction of the arrow C. As a result, the latch member 1825 is in the intermediate position (as shown in Figure 39). In the intermediate position, the top surface of finger actuation portion 1840 may be pushed inwardly by the pulp of the intended adult user's finger within bore 1820 by a predetermined distance "d". Bore 1820 and cam member 1832 are configured so that the pulp of the intended adult user can push the finger actuation portion into bore 1820. Then movement in the downward direction by the finger will cause the actuator to move along the actuation axis L and ignite the lighter. When the actuator 1810 and latch member 1825 are released, the spring in the piezoelectric (not shown) returns the actuator to the first position, and the spring 1860 biases the latch member into the first or inoperative position. Although the cam member is shown extending from the rear of the actuator, it can also be positioned to extend from the side of the actuator.<br>
Referring to Figures 40 and 41, another embodiment of a lighter 1905 is illustrated. The lighter 1905 is substantially similar to the lighter 1805 shown in Figure 39, except that the angle p is shown to be substantially 0°. In other words, the actuator 1910<br><br>
r<br>
includes a cavity 1915, and opening, such as a bore or slot 1920, where the bore is disposed through the top wall 1923 of the actuator. As a result, the actuation axis X of the cam member 1925 is substantially parallel to the axis L. The cam member 1925 includes a circumferentially extending ledge 1930 between the lower cam surface 1935 and the finger actuation portion 1940. The ledge 1930 helps prevent the cam member from exiting the bore 1920.<br>
The body portion 1950 includes an upper cam surface portions 1955a and 1955b which are angularly offset from one another. In the first or inoperative position, the cam member 1925 is in contact with the cam surface portion 1955b. When the cam member 1925 is depressed in the direction A, the lower cam surface 1935 moves along the cam surface portion 1955b to the cam surface portion 1955a and causes the body portion 1950 to pivot into the intermediate or operative position (as shown in Figure 41) allowing the movement of actuator 1910 along the axis L to the actuation position. As shown in Figure 41, in the intermediate position, the top surface of finger actuation portion 1940 may be pushed inwardly by the pulp of the intended adult user's finger within bore 1920 by a predetermined distance "d". Bore 1920 and cam member 1925 are sized and dimensioned such that the pulp of the intended adult user can push the finger actuation portion 1940 into bore 1920- In another embodiment, the cam member can be positioned to extend through the top wall of the actuator at any other locations on the top wall.<br>
Referring to Figures 42-43, another embodiment of a lighter 2805 is illustrated. The lighter 2805 is substantially similar to the lighter 1805 shown in Figure 38. Actuator 2810 includes an outer surface 2812, an internal cavity 2815 and an opening, such as bore or slot 2820, is defined through the actuator. The bore 2820 is in communication with the cavity 281.<br>
The latch member 2825 includes a body portion 2826 and a separate cam member 2832 slidably engaged therewith. The body portion 2826 is pivotally coupled to the actuator 2810 in the same manner described above. The body portion 2826 includes upper cam surface portions 2830a, 2830b, and 2830c. The surface portion 2830a is the uppermost portion, surface portion 2830c is the lowermost portion, and the substantially vertical surface portion 2830b extends there between. The body portion further includes a free end 2835 opposite the cam surface portions 2830a-c.<br><br>
The cam member 2832 includes a ledge 2835, a finger actuation portion 2840 with an upper surface 2842, and a lower cam surface 2845 spaced from the finger actuation portion 2840. The ledge 2835 prevents the cam member from exiting bore 2820. As shown in Figure 42, in the first or inoperative position the cam member 2832 of the latch member extends below the outer surface 2812 of the actuator so that the upper surface 2842 is spaced a first distance Dl beneath the outer surface 2812. Furthermore, the cam surface 2845 is disposed on the cam surface portion 2830a, and the free end 2835 of the latch member is aligned with the blocking surface 2846.<br>
When an intended user engages the finger actuation portion 2840 with the pulp of his or her finger, and depresses the cam member 2832 in a downward direction A, the cam surface 2845 contacts and slides along the cam surface portions 2830a-c. The actuation axis of the cam member 2840 is designated X. The actuation axis X is similarly defined as discussed above with respect to Figures 38-39.<br>
During depression of the cam member 2832, referring to Figure 43, the top surface 2842 of the finger actuation portion 2840 may be pushed inwardly by the pulp of the intended adult user's finger within bore 2820 a second distance D2 beneath the outer surface 2812 of the actuator. The upper end 2850 of the body portion pivots in the direction of the arrow B and the lower end 2855 of the body portion pivots in the opposite direction of the arrow C. As a result, the latch member 2825 is in the intermediate position (as shown in Figure 42). Bore 2820 and cam member 2832 are configured so that the pulp of the intended adult user can push the finger actuation portion deeper into bore 2820 than in the first position. In the intermediate position, the second distance D2 is greater than the first distance Dl.<br>
Then movement in the downward direction by the finger will cause the actuator to move along the actuation axis L and ignite the lighter. When the actuator 2810 and latch member 2825 are released, the spring in the piezoelectric (not shown) returns the actuator to the first position, and the spring 2860 biases the latch member into the first or inoperative position. Although the cam member is shown extending from the rear of the actuator, it can also be positioned to extend from the side of the actuator.<br>
In all of the embodiments shown in Figures 19-43 above, the finger can make uninterrupted contact with the finger actuation portion of the latch member from movement of the latch member from the first or inoperative position to the operative or<br><br>
intermediate position and movement of the actuator from the first position to an actuation position. In the intermediate position, the latch member is unaligned with the blocking surface on the lighter body, and the actuator is in its first position and can be moved to the actuation positioned. Furthermore, also applicable to all embodiments the latch member is actuatable by a portion of the pulp of the fingers of intended adult users.<br>
While it is apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well calculated to fulfill the objects above stated, it will be appreciated that modifications and embodiments may be devised by those skilled in the art. One such modification includes changing the biasing element to another element that biases the latch member into the inoperative position. For example, resilient material, such as foam can be used, a metal coil spring, a plastic spring leg integrally formed with the latch member, or the like can also be used. Another modification includes pivotally coupling the latch member to the actuator in a number of ways including using pivot members with cam surfaces, overhangs with cam surfaces, and bores cooperating with pins as disclosed above with reference to Figures 1-3 and 10-18. The embodiments above can also be modified so that some features of one embodiment are used with the features of another embodiment. In addition, the latch member can include cutouts and the actuator can include pins for allowing pivoting of the latch member. Other pivotal connections, such as projections with cam surfaces can also be used. Furthermore, the actuator and the housing can be configured so that the actuator slides along the longitudinal axis L within the housing without the guide of the embodiment shown in Figure 20 above. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and embodiments as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
