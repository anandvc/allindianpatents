				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a lens for steering the exit direction of an<br>
electromagnetic wave which is incident upon the lens, said lens comprising a main body<br>
of a ferroelectric material with at least a first main surface and a first transformer which<br>
is adjacent to said first main surface of said ferroelectric body. The lens additionally<br>
comprises means for creating a first DC-field in a first direction in the main body, and<br>
the incident electromagnetic wave will enter and exit the lens through the transformer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ferroelectric materials have a dielectric constant which can be altered if a DC-field is<br>
induced in the material. This property has been used to manufacture lenses of<br>
ferroelectric materials for electrical steering of electromagnetic beams, such as an<br>
antenna beam, the beam being the "output" from the lens of an electromagnetic field<br>
which has been incident upon the lens.<br>
A lens which is made from a ferroelectric materials and which is used for electrically<br>
steering the exit direction of a beam which is incident upon the lens and exits the lens is<br>
known from IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, pp 458-468, volume 47,<br>
no 3 1999, "Voltage-Controlled Ferroelectric Lens Phased Arrays".<br>
A drawback of the device discussed in this article is the complexity of the design and the<br>
price. The device uses a multitude of traditional waveguides filled with ferroelectric<br>
materials and input/output matching sections which would increase the cost of the<br>
device.<br>
Another ferroelectric beam-steering lens is known from 33rd EuMC WS6 proceedings,<br>
pp 79-82. Drawbacks of the device disclosed in this paper seem to be a very high<br>
charging time constant, as well as quite a high voltage (in the order of magnitude of<br>
20kV) needed to drive the lens. Additionally, the fabrication of a large area ferroelectric<br>
plates (lens) as disclosed in this paper is complicated - it is hard to fabricate the large<br>
size (&gt;5x5cm2) plates of the design with acceptable densification and uniformity.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is thus a need for a ferroelectric lens for steering the output direction of an incident<br>
electromagnetic beam which is less expensive and less complex to manufacture than<br>
those known at present. In addition, such a new lens should also need lower driving<br>
voltages than lenses which are known at present.<br>
These needs are addressed by the present invention in that it discloses a lens for steering<br>
the exit direction of an electromagnetic wave which is incident upon the lens, the lens<br>
comprising a main body of a ferroelectric material with at least a first main surface, also<br>
comprising a first transformer which is adjacent to said first main surface of said<br>
ferroelectric body.<br>
The electromagnetic wave will enter and exit the lens through the transformer, with the<br>
lens additionally comprising means for creating a first DC-field in a first direction in the<br>
main body.<br>
According to the invention, the lens's main body of ferroelectric material comprises a<br>
plurality of discrete slabs of the ferroelectric material, each slab in said plurality also<br>
comprising a first and a second electrode of an electrically conducting material. Also, the<br>
means for creating a DC-field can create a gradient DC-field in said first direction, using<br>
the first and second electrodes in the plurality of slabs, by means of which the dielectric<br>
constant in the main body will also be a gradient in said first direction, thus enabling<br>
steering of the exiting electromagnetic wave, and offer design flexibility with low<br>
expenses.<br>
Thus, by means of the invention, a beam-steering lens made from a ferroelectric material<br>
is obtained which will be less expensive to produce than previously known such lenses,<br>
and, as will become apparent from the more detailed description, will also require much<br>
lower control voltages than previously known such lenses.<br>
Suitably, the means for creating a DC-field are adapted to create said first DC-field in a<br>
first direction which is essentially parallel to said first main surface of the main body.<br>
3<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the lens additionally comprises a second<br>
transformer, and the main body of ferroelectric material has a second main surface, with<br>
each of the first and second transformers being arranged adjacent to one of the main<br>
surfaces of the main body, so that the electromagnetic wave will enter the lens through<br>
one of the transformers and exit through the other of the transformers.<br>

EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig 1 illustrates some of the basic principles of a lens 100 according to the invention. As<br>
shown in the drawing, the invention comprises a lens 100 which in turn comprises a<br>
body 110 of a ferroelectric material. One property of a ferroelectric material is that the<br>
dielectric constant, 8, of the material can be changed by subjecting the material to a DC-<br>
field.<br>
4<br><br>
As illustrated schematically in fig 1, the lens of the invention comprises means 140 for<br>
creating a DC-field to be applied to the body 110 of ferroelectric material. If the DC-field<br>
which is created over or in the ferroelectric body is not constant, but is instead a gradient<br>
in at least one direction, the dielectric constant, 8, of the ferroelectric body will vary<br>
according to the gradient of the DC-field.<br>
An application of the ability to change the dielectric constant of the body of ferroelectric<br>
material is shown in fig 1: a plane electromagnetic wave 150 is incident upon a first main<br>
surface of the body 110, the incident direction being normal to the first main surface. The<br>
wave enters the body 110 through the first main surface, and exits through a second main<br>
surface of the body.<br>
According to the invention, the DC-means 140 are used to create a DC-field in a first<br>
direction in the body 110, the direction shown in fig 1 being indicated by an arrow and<br>
being parallel to one edge of the body which is shown as having an essentially square or<br>
rectangular shape. The direction of the DC-field created by the DC-means is in the<br>
direction denoted as "x" in a coordinate system shown in fig 1, the x-axis coinciding<br>
with said edge of the essentially square body. As mentioned, the DC-field created in the<br>
lens 100 of the invention is a gradient, thus in this case a DC-gradient is created along<br>
the x-direction of the lens.<br>
A result of the gradient DC-field is also shown in fig 1: the plane electromagnetic wave<br>
150 which enters the ferroelectric body 110 through the first main surface of the<br>
ferroelectric body 110 at an incident angle which is normal to the first main surface exits<br>
the lens through the second main surface of the body at a direction which deviates an<br>
angle  from the normal.<br>
The fact that the exit direction of an incident wave can be changed by means of imposing<br>
a gradient DC-field upon the ferroelectric body means that a lens according to the<br>
invention can be used as a beam steering device. The device 100 shown in fig 1 only<br>
5<br><br>
serves to illustrate the basic principle behind the invention, the description will now<br>
show the invention in closer detail.<br>
Fig 2 shows a lens 200 of the invention in a cross-section along the dotted line II-II in fig<br>
1: as with the lens 100 of fig 1, the lens 200 in fig 2 comprises a body 210 of a<br>
ferroelectric material, which will be described in more detail later. The body 210 also<br>
exhibits a first main surface 207.<br>
In addition, which was not shown in fig 1, the lens 200 of fig 2 comprises a matching<br>
transformer 220 which is arranged adjacent to the first main surface 207 of the<br>
ferroelectric body 210. The function of the transformer 220 is to facilitate the entry and<br>
exit of an electromagnetic wave between the lens and the ambient atmosphere, which<br>
will be described in more detail later.<br>
Thus, there should suitably also be a transformer where a wave will exit the lens. This<br>
can be accomplished by letting the transformer 220 surround the lens at both the<br>
intended entry and exit surfaces for the wave, i.e. by letting the first transformer be in<br>
one solid contiguous piece, or, as shown in fig 2, by letting the lens 200 of the invention<br>
comprise a second transformer 222 in addition to the first transformer 220, the second<br>
transformer being arranged adjacent to the intended exit surface of the electromagnetic<br>
wave, i.e. adjacent to a second main surface 208 of the body 210.<br>
As shown in fig 2, the ferroelectric body 210 is suitably shaped as a rectangular box, so<br>
that the first 207 and second 208 main surfaces of the body 210 become two opposing<br>
main surfaces of the box.<br>
Also, according to the invention, as shown in fig 2, the ferroelectric body 210 comprises<br>
a plurality of discrete slabs 210I-210N AS shown in fig 2, the slabs 210I-210N are<br>
stacked adjacent to each other, in this example on top of each other, to form the<br>
ferroelectric body 210.<br>
6<br><br>
Thus, a plane electromagnetic wave 240 which is incident upon the lens 200 in a<br>
direction normal to the first main surface 207 of the body of ferroelectric material 210<br>
will enter the lens through the first transformer 220 and the first main surface 207 and<br>
exit the body 210 through the second main surface 208 and the second transformer 222.<br>
As illustrated in fig 2, and as explained previously, the direction of the exiting wave 250<br>
can be controlled by means of introducing an electrical field in the body 210 so that an<br>
electrical gradient is formed, suitably having a maximum at an "end slab" 2101 or 210N<br>
and a corresponding minimum at another "end slab".<br>
Accordingly, the lens of the invention comprises means (DC+, GND) for introducing a<br>
first DC-field in a first direction in the main body. This will now be described in more<br>
detail with reference to fig 3.<br>
Fig 3 shows the lens 200 from fig 2 in a cross-sectional front view along the dashed line<br>
III-III shown in fig 2. Fig 3 clearly shows the composition of the body 210, with a<br>
plurality of slabs, the slabs in this particular case being elongated box-like structures<br>
arranged as a matrix in rows and columns, so that each slab, as shown on the drawing,<br>
can be seen as an element in a two-dimensional matrix, 21011-210NN.<br>
The matrix is of course only one suitable form for the ferroelectric body 210, as is the<br>
elongated box-like shape of the individual slabs, many other forms of slabs and<br>
ferroelectric bodies can be realized within the scope of the invention. For example, in<br>
this particular embodiment, each row, i.e. elements 21011-210IN etc. can be one<br>
contiguous slab, so that the body 210 instead comprises a plurality of "boards" arranged<br>
on top of each other.<br>
As mentioned previously, the lens of the invention also comprises means for creating a<br>
DC-field gradient in the lens. These means can be seen more clearly in fig 3, and in this<br>
example comprise a first set of "ground lines" 370 and a second set of DC-lines 380.<br>
7<br><br>
As can be seen, the ground lines 370 are connected to a common ground point GND, and<br>
the DC-lines are connected to a DC-power supply "V". Before the means for creating the<br>
DC-field are described further, the individual elements, the "slabs" of the ferroelectric<br>
body 210 will now be described in more detail, with the aid of fig 4.<br>
Fig 4 shows one of the slabs 210Xx of the matrix shown in fig 3. As can be seen from fig<br>
4, the slab is rectangular and box-like, with a width w, a height h and a length l. It is the<br>
two surfaces (front and rear "face" of the slab) defined by the width w and the height h<br>
which form the first and second main surfaces 207, 208, of the body 210 of ferroelectric<br>
material.<br>
According to the invention, the slabs in the matrix, as shown in fig 3, comprise a first<br>
and a second electrode of an electrically conducting material, such as, for example, Ag,<br>
Au, Pt or Pd. With the slabs having the shape shown in fig 4, the electrodes are suitably<br>
arranged on a top 403 and bottom surface of the slab. Thus, with the coordinate system<br>
shown at the bottom right of fig 4, two slabs which are arranged adjacent to each other in<br>
the x-direction will have mechanical and galvanic contact between the top electrode of<br>
one slab and the bottom electrode of the other slab. Due to the electrodes, each individual<br>
slab 21011-210NN can be seen as an elementary TEM-waveguide.<br>
Returning now to fig 3 and the means for creating a DC-field, as mentioned above, these<br>
means comprise a first set of ground lines 370 and a second set of DC-lines 380.<br>
Let's consider the slabs in the "rightmost" column, i.e. slabs 210IN, 2102N---210NN. Slab<br>
210IN is arranged so that its bottom electrode is in contact with the top electrode of the<br>
slab immediately below it, i.e. slab 2102N This is the principle adhered to with all of the<br>
slabs (except, for natural reasons, the uppermost and lowermost of the slabs) in any<br>
specific column: the bottom electrode of each slab is in contact with the top electrode of<br>
the slab immediately below it.<br>
A number of connection points are thus created at the intersection between two slabs,<br>
where each connection point comprises the bottom electrode of one slab and the top<br>
8<br><br>
electrode of the next slab immediately below. If the two electrodes do not extend to the<br>
sides of the slabs so that the connection points can not be accessed at the sides, an extra<br>
conductor can be introduced to facilitate electrical access to the meeting points of the two<br>
electrodes.<br>
Thus, at the intersections or connection points between two slabs, it will be possible to<br>
establish a potential by connecting the connecting point to a DC-feed. This is what is<br>
done in the embodiment of fig 3: there is a first potential line 370 connected to ground,<br>
and a second potential line 380 connected to a DC-supply. By means of these two<br>
potential lines, the gradient field in the ferroelectric body 210 is created, in the following<br>
manner: the second potential line 380 is connected to a DC-supply, and comprises a<br>
number of voltage dividers, in this case resistors.<br>
Fig 3 shows seven resistors, so let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that VDC=7 Volts.<br>
Needless to say, the number of resistors and the amplitude of the DC-voltage are merely<br>
examples, the number of resistors and the DC-amplitude can be varied as necessary,<br>
according to the application.<br>
Using VDC=7V, there will then be a voltage of 1 V across each resistor, with the voltage<br>
between any one resistor and ground being shown next to the resistors, said voltage to<br>
ground varying as a gradient from 0 to 7 volts.<br>
With the exception of the first slab, i.e. slab 210IN, the electrode on one side (top/bottom)<br>
of each slab will be connected to a point in the ground line 370, and the electrode on the<br>
other side (bottom/top) of the same slab will be connected to a point in the second<br>
potential line 380.<br>
Thus, one of the electrodes in each slab will be connected to ground, and the other<br>
electrode will be connected to the potential line supplied by the DC-feed.<br>
In order to create the desired DC-gradient over the slabs, starting from the slab which<br>
will be the lowest potential in the DC-gradient, and going in the direction of the desired<br>
9<br><br>
gradient, each slab is connected to a point in the second potential line 380 which has a<br>
higher potential than the point in the next slab which is connected to the second potential<br>
line 380.<br>
In order to facilitate the understanding of this, fig 3 shows the voltage on each side of<br>
each resistor in the second potential line 380.<br>
In order to further facilitate the understanding of this principle, the table below shows,<br>
for the slabs in the rightmost column, column N, the potential between the point in the<br>
slab which is connected to the DC-line and ground. Since there are 16 rows shown in the<br>
drawing, which is of course merely an example, the slab at the bottom right hand corner<br>
will here be denoted 210I6,N-<br><br>
Slab	Voltage<br>
2101,N	0<br>
2102,N	0<br>
2103,N	1<br>
2104,N	1<br>
2105,N	2<br>
2106,N	2<br>
2107,N	3<br>
2108,N	3<br>

21014,N	6<br>

21016,N	7<br>
10<br><br>
Thus, there is a DC-gradient created over the body 210 of ferroelectric material, the<br>
gradient being indicated by the arrow G in fig 3. The DC- gradient in turn creates a<br>
gradient in the dielectric constant s in the body, the s decreasing in the same direction as<br>
the DC-voltage increases, i.e. the higher DC-field biasing, the lower the 8 of the<br>
ferroelectric material.<br>
Since it is possible to control the gradient by means of controlling the potential line 380,<br>
it will now be realized that this control can also be used to control the output direction <br>
of the exiting electromagnetic wave 250 which was shown and described in connection<br>
with fig 2. Thus, by using the DC-means shown in figs 2 and 3 and described above, it<br>
will be possible to control the exit direction of the electromagnetic wave in the "x"-<br>
direction, with reference to the coordinate system shown in fig 3.<br>
Another important principle of the invention will also have emerged from the description<br>
of the DC-means or biasing means: the DC-field which is created in a lens of the<br>
invention will be essentially parallel to the E-field of the incident electromagnetic wave<br>
shown in fig 2. This allows for greater tuning precision than in previously known<br>
designs, where the two E-fields (biasing field and incident wave field) have often been<br>
more or less orthogonal to each other.<br>
Fig 5 shows a different embodiment 500 of the invention, by means of which the<br>
direction of the exiting electromagnetic beam can be controlled in both the x- and the y-<br>
direction, with renewed reference to the coordinate system shown in fig 3 and also in fig<br>
5.<br>
As with the previous embodiments, the embodiment 500 is based on a body of<br>
ferroelectric material 510. The lens 500 comprises one or several matching transformers<br>
at the main surfaces of the body, which is in similarity to the embodiment shown and<br>
explained in conjunction with figs 2-4, for which reason the transformers will not be<br>
described again here.<br>
11<br><br>
The ferroelectric body 510 is also comprised of a plurality of slabs, 51011-510NN, which<br>
in the drawing are shown as rectangular box-like structures arranged as a matrix with N<br>
rows and N columns. One of the slabs used in the embodiment 500 is shown in more<br>
detail in fig 6.<br>
As with the slabs of the previous embodiment, the slab 510xx shown in fig 6 comprises<br>
a first and a second electrode, in the example arranged on a top 603 and a bottom surface<br>
of the slab. In further similarity to the slabs of fig 3 and 4, the slab 510xx is rectangular<br>
and box-like, with a width w, a height h and a length l. The two surfaces (the front and<br>
rear "face" of the slab) defined by the width w and the height h of the slab form first and<br>
second main surfaces 507, 508, of the body 510 of ferroelectric material.<br>
However, as opposed to the previously shown slabs, the slab or TEM-waveguide 510xx<br>
of the embodiment 500 has a two-layered structure, shown in fig 6, and composed as<br>
follows:<br>
A first layer 605 of ferroelectric material is arranged on top of a second layer 606 of a<br>
ferroelectric material, suitably but not necessarily the same kind of ferroelectric material.<br>
Between these two layers 605, 606, there is arranged a layer of conducting material,<br>
which is suitably a material with a high resistivity, for reasons which will become clear<br>
later on in this description. As with the slabs shown earlier, the slab 510xx can be seen as<br>
an elementary TEM-waveguide, and comprises a first and a second electrode of a<br>
conducting material with low resistivity, the first electrode 603 in this example being<br>
arranged on a "top" surface of the slab, and the second electrode 604 being arranged on<br>
the opposing bottom surface of the slab.<br>
Thus, as shown in fig 5, in addition to the connection points of the arrangement shown in<br>
figs 2 and 3, additional or intermediate connection points are created in between the<br>
connection points shown previously, the additional connection points being access points<br>
to the layer of high resistivity, which can be seen as a third electrode in each slab.<br>
12<br><br>
As show in fig 5, in addition to the ground means 570 and first means for creating a DC-<br>
gradient 580, the lens 500 comprises second means 590 for creating a DC-gradient in a<br>
second direction in the ferroelectric body 510. Suitably, as will be explained below, the<br>
direction of the second gradient is perpendicular to the direction of the first gradient<br>
created by the first means 580, but other directions are possible within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
As shown in fig 5, the second means 590 for creating a gradient also comprises a DC-<br>
supply (V1) connected to a number of voltage dividers, in this case resistors.<br>
As can be seen in fig 5, the third electrodes 607 are connected to both of the voltage<br>
supplies V1, V2, the connections being made to one voltage supply V1 on a first main<br>
edge 501 of the body 510, and to the other voltage supply V2 on an opposing second<br>
main edge 502 of the body 510. In addition, the connections are made so that a first (in<br>
the "x"-direction) of the third electrodes 607 is connected to a first side of a first voltage<br>
divider in each of the two networks 580, 590, and the next (in the "x"-direction) of the<br>
third electrodes is connected to the second side of the first voltage divider, as well as<br>
being connected to a first side of the second voltage divider.<br>
The next after that of the third electrodes is then connected to the second side of the<br>
second voltage divider. In short, the principle which will now have been realized is that<br>
one voltage divider from each of the DC-supplies, V1, V2, will connect two adjacent third<br>
electrodes.<br>
The connection points which are created at the intersections between the slabs of the<br>
body 510 are also utilized in this embodiment, in this case by being connected to a<br>
grounding network or ground lines 570.<br>
Using the principle described in connection to figs 2-4, it will be realized that a DC-<br>
gradient can be created in the x-direction in the embodiment 500 as well, using either the<br>
voltage supply V2 or V1. Also, the reason for using a material with a high resistivity in<br>
the third electrode will also be realized: if there is a voltage difference between the DC-<br>
13<br><br>
supplies V1 and V2 and the connection between them is not an ideal conductor, there will<br>
be an essentially linear voltage drop in the y-direction, by means of which a DC-gradient<br>
is created in that direction as well, by means of a voltage difference V1-V2.<br>
Thus, by means of controlling the two voltage supplies V1 and V2, the dielectrical<br>
constant 8 of the board can be made to vary as a gradient in both the x- and the y-<br>
directions, by means of which the exit direction of the incident electromagnetic wave can<br>
be controlled in both directions, which was the desired result of the embodiment 500.<br>
It should be mentioned here that in the ferroelectric body 510, in similarity to the<br>
ferroelectric body 210, the elements of one column, e.g. elements 51011-510IN, can be<br>
one contiguous slab instead of discrete elements, i.e. the body 510 can consist of<br>
"boards" stacked on top of each, and other.<br>
The embodiments shown above and in the appended drawings are merely examples to<br>
facilitate the understanding of the invention, it will be realized that many variations are<br>
possible, both when it comes to the structure of the TEM-waveguides ("slabs") and when<br>
it comes to the means for creating the DC-gradient field.<br>
One example of an alternative embodiment 700 is shown in fig 7: the ferroelectric lens<br>
700 comprises a ferroelectric body 710, with a matching transformer 720, 722, adjacent<br>
to each of two main surfaces 707, 708, of the ferroelectric body 710.<br>
However, as an alternative, the lens 700 has a concave first main surface 707 and a plane<br>
second main surface 708, with the respective matching transformers 720, 722, having<br>
corresponding shapes. This shape of the components of the lens make it possible to, for<br>
example, shape the beam form and/or beam width of the output beam.<br>
Some examples of materials and dimensions for a lens according to the invention will<br>
also be given. It should be pointed out that although these materials and examples are<br>
suitable for a lens according to the invention, these are examples only, and should not be<br>
seen as restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
14<br><br>
As an example of a suitable material for the ferroelectric slabs of the ferroelectric body,<br>
mention can be made of BaxSq _xTiO3, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.<br>
When it comes to choosing materials for the matching transformers, any material with a<br>
suitable dielectric constant may be chosen, i.e. the following formula should be adhered<br>
to:<br><br><br><br>
Regarding the dimensions, in other words w, h, 1, of the "slabs" or TEM-waveguides in<br>
the body of ferroelectric material, the following can be said: the width w may be<br>
determined, for example, by ease of fabrication. In other words, the smaller the width w<br>
of the waveguides is, the higher the yield will be, if the waveguides are produced as parts<br>
of a larger block.<br>
As for the height h, or that dimension which will be the height when the waveguides are<br>
arranged in the lens as shown above, the height h should be less than the half of the<br>
intended operating wavelength of the lens. Hence, we can talk about a specific height<br>
only in connection with a specific frequency. If, for example, the lens is to be designed to<br>
work at lOGHz using ferroelectric with e=200m we then have:<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the general formula for the height h of the slabs is:<br><br>
where c is the speed of light, f is the intended operating frequency (centre frequency) of<br>
the lens, and ferr is the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric material used.<br>
15<br><br>
An example of a suitable height h of a slab is in the are of 0.5-1 mm. This is merely an<br>
example of a suitable value, and is in no way restrictive for the invention.<br>
With suitable ferroelectric materials, a typical value of the control voltage would be<br>
l0V/m in the direction in which the voltage is applied. Thus, in the case of a slab with h<br>
= lmm, the control voltage would be lkV.<br>
The length 1 of the slabs is defined by, among other things, the required range of the<br>
scanning angle of the lens. A typical value for 1 would be in the range of approximately<br>
10-20mm.<br>
Regarding the matching transformers, their depth, i.e. the dimension which is<br>
perpendicular to the main surfaces of the body of ferroelectric material, the depth of the<br>
transformers should be a quarter-wavelength of the intended operating frequency. For the<br>
frequency l0GHz and dielectric constant of ferroelectric e=200, and using equation (1)<br>
above for the dielectric constant of the transformer, we would thus have a transformer<br>
depth dTRANs:<br><br>
As an example of a suitable material for the high resistivity film, mention may be made<br>
of LaMnO3/SrTiO3.<br>
Fig 8b shows a variation 820 of the waveguides shown above: in fig 8a, as background,<br>
the slab described above is shown, i.e. a rectangular box-like shape 810 of ferroelectric<br>
material, with two electrodes, one each on opposing surfaces of the box. In fig 8b, the<br>
waveguide is instead formed as a multilayer structure 820, i.e. it has alternating layers of<br>
ferroelectric material and conductors. Thus, in addition to the top and bottom electrodes<br>
shown previously, the waveguide 820 alternatingly has intermediate electrodes or<br>
electrode layers 821, and intermediate ferroelectric layers 822.<br>
16<br><br>
Figs 9a and 9b show versions 910 and 920 of a lens according to the invention seen from<br>
the same perspective as in fig 2 above, i.e. a cross sectional view from the side. As<br>
shown in figs 9a and 9b, the waveguides of the ferroelectric body 921, 922 can be of<br>
different lengths, the dimension / described previously. In addition, figs 9a and 9b show<br>
alternative versions 911, 921, of the transformers used with the body of ferroelectric<br>
material: since the waveguides of figs 9a and 9b are of different lengths, the main<br>
surfaces of the bodies of ferroelectric material are not smooth. However, the transformers<br>
911,921, are adapted to this, i.e. the s of the transformer for each waveguide is<br>
determined by (1), and the thickness of the transformer for each waveguide is /4.<br>
Additionally, the surface of the transformers 911,921, which is intended to face<br>
outwards from the lens 910, 920 is smooth, but in the case of fig 9a, the lens 910<br>
comprises two transformer parts 91 l1, 9112, one arranged adjacent to each main surface<br>
of the body of ferroelectric material 912, and which both have a straight outer edge<br>
which is arranged to coincide with a main direction of extension of the body 912 of<br>
ferroelectric material.<br>
In the case of fig 9b, the lens 920 comprises also two transformer parts 92l1 9212, one<br>
arranged adjacent to each main surface of the body of ferroelectric material 912.<br>
However, the outer edge of these transformer parts is convex, giving the resulting lens an<br>
essentially oval shape.<br>
In fig 10, a lens 1000 of the invention is shown in the same perspective as in figs 3 and 5,<br>
i.e. a cross sectional view showing one of the main surfaces of the lens, as well as the<br>
transformers 1001, 1002. Fig 10 intends to show a practical detail which may be of use<br>
when manufacturing a lens of the invention: as described previously, the lens 1000<br>
comprises a plurality of electrodes 1005 and connections between the electrodes and<br>
means for creating DC-voltages as shown in, for example, figs 3 and 5. In order to<br>
prevent interference and short circuits between the different connections to the DC-<br>
voltage, a special isolating layer 1003, 1004, may need to be arranged on one or both<br>
sides of the main surface of the ferroelectric body, if that is where the connections<br>
between the DC-means and the electrodes are made. Thus, the connections will be<br>
17<br><br>
"embedded" in the isolating layer 1003, 1004, and isolated from each other. The material<br>
for the isolating layer may be chosen from among any of a number of well-known<br>
isolating materials.<br>
Fig lla shows another embodiment 1100 of a lens according to the invention, seen in the<br>
same perspective as the lens in figs 3, 5 or 10: in the same manner as the lenses described<br>
hitherto, the lens 1100 comprises a number of TEM-waveguides made of a ferroelectric<br>
body, and arranged so that they together form a body of ferroelectric material. For the<br>
sake of clarity, the transformers and DC-means are not shown in fig 11, since they can be<br>
the same as those shown previously.<br>
The main difference between the embodiment 1100 and those shown previously is the<br>
following: the TEM-waveguides of the lens 1100 are equipped with a first and a second<br>
electrode, but not on those sides which will face the waveguides in the rows below and,<br>
where applicable, above. Instead, the waveguides of the lens 1100 have a first and a<br>
second electrode on those sides which face neighbouring waveguides in the same row.<br>
This is illustrated using two adjacent waveguides 1102 and 1104 in the lens 1100. Thus,<br>
the waveguide 1102 has a first 1101 and a second 1103 electrode on each of said sides,<br>
and shares the second electrode 1103 with the waveguide 1106 which is immediately<br>
adjacent to it on that side.<br>
As can be seen in fig 11a, the waveguides are arranged so that the electrodes of the<br>
waveguides in one row do not risk coming into contact with the electrodes of the<br>
waveguides in the adjacent rows. Suitably, this is done as shown in fig lla: the rows<br>
11001-11007 are alternatingly displaced a distance A with respect to the immediately<br>
adjacent rows, so that the electrodes of the waveguides in one row will not risk coming<br>
into contact with the electrodes of the waveguides in the surrounding rows.<br>
One benefit of the embodiment of fig 11a is that each waveguide can be addressed<br>
individually, as opposed to the previously shown embodiments. Thus, for example, the<br>
electrodes  1101  and  1103 will be used to address waveguide  1102, etc. In this<br>
18<br><br>
embodiment, the DC-biasing network is suitably arranged in the plane of the main<br>
surface of the ferroelectric body.<br>
Naturally, an embodiment where each waveguide can b addressed individually will<br>
naturally allow for greater flexibility when it comes to shaping the gradient in the<br>
ferroelectric body.<br>
Fig 11b shows an alternative embodiment 1105 of the lens shown in fig 11a. The<br>
waveguides of fig 11b are similar to those in fig 1 la, the main difference is that they are<br>
not arranged in rows with equal numbers of waveguides, thus giving the main surface of<br>
the ferroelectric body a slightly oval shape.<br>
The embodiment shown in fig 11 is one where each waveguide can be addressed<br>
individually, but where the gradient(s) can only be created in one direction. Fig 12 shows<br>
an embodiment where this is improved upon: in the lens 1200, which is shown in the<br>
same perspective as that in fig 11, there is a plurality of waveguides, in this case 64<br>
waveguides, arranged in regular rows and columns to form an a 8*8 matrix. A plurality<br>
of these waveguides, in the present example all of them, have a first, a second, a third,<br>
and a fourth electrode.<br>
In the example shown, the waveguides are rectangular and box-like, with a basic<br>
structure similar to that shown in fig 4. The waveguides used in the lens 1200 have their<br>
electrodes arranged so that there is one electrode on each of those sides of the "box" or<br>
"slab" which do not contribute in forming either of the main surfaces of the lens 1200.<br>
Thus, each waveguide (apart from those situated in the outer rows) will have one<br>
electrode in common with one of the other waveguides which surround it on each side.<br>
As an example, consider waveguide 1200n: this waveguide has four electrodes, one on<br>
each of said sides. The waveguide 1200n has one electrode on one side in common with<br>
the neighbouring waveguide in the "y"-direction, using the same coordinate system as<br>
previously, i.e. waveguide 120012.<br>
19<br><br>
Additionally, waveguide 120011 also has one of its electrodes in common with the<br>
neighbouring waveguide 120021 in the "x"-direction. Since waveguide 120011 is arranged<br>
in the upper left hand corner of the matrix, and thus has no neighbours in two directions,<br>
two of the electrodes will not be shared with any of the other waveguides but the<br>
principle will have been realized.<br>
With the embodiment shown in fig 12, each waveguide can thus be addressed<br>
individually, and be controlled to have an individual DC-voltage in two directions, which<br>
leads to an antenna or lens which can have beam steering in two directions.<br>
As mentioned in conjunction with the embodiments shown in figs 3 and 5, a great<br>
advantage of the invention is that the E-field of the incident wave will be essentially<br>
parallel to the E-field of the biasing network. With the embodiment of fig 12, even<br>
greater flexibility regarding the E-field of the incident electromagnetic wave can be<br>
allowed, since the E-field of the biasing network can be controlled with a greater degree<br>
of flexibility, thus allowing the E-field of the incident wave to have basically any<br>
polarization.<br>
Also, it should be pointed out that the embodiment shown in fig 12, it will be possible to<br>
create "local gradients" within the lens, i.e. areas within the lens with different<br>
dielectrical constants, s.<br>
Finally, fig 13a shows the same basic concept as that in fig 12, but also illustrates how<br>
the electrodes may be designed: until now, the electrodes have been shown as basically<br>
flat. This is one embodiment, but as shown in fig 13 a, they may also be circular in their<br>
cross-sectional shape.<br>
Fig 13b shows one of the individual waveguides of fig 13 a.<br>
The invention is not limited to the examples of embodiments shown above, but may be<br>
varied freely within the scope of the appended claims. Thus, the waveguides may be<br>
given any number of cross sectional shapes, as is well known in waveguide technology.<br>
20<br><br>
For example, cross sectional shapes which could be possible are round, oval, hexagonal,<br>
etc.<br>
Also, the waveguides of the invention can be used within other applications. For<br>
example, the waveguides could be used as phase shifters in hybrid integrated circuits.<br>
