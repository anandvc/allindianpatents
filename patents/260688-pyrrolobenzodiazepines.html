				<td>PYROLOBENZODIAZEPINES<br>
The present, invent ion relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), and in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepines useful in the synthesis of dirneric compounds.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu.  The first FED antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al . , J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)}.  S:i nee then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been report-fid, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., Chem. Rev. 1994, 433-465 (1994)).  Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., J. Antibiotics, 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamyc-in (Konishi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 37, 200-206 (1984)),<br>
DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al. , --Chem. Brit.,<br>
. 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., Tetrahedron, 48, 751-758<br>
(1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., J. Antibiotics, 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et aj, J. Antibiotics, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, J. Org. Chem., 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102) (Hara, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., J. Antibiotics, 25, 437-444 (1972)).  PBDs are of the general structure:<br>
(Figure Remove) They differ in me number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring.  In the B-ring there is either an imine (N=0), a carbinolamine(NH-CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH-CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral Clla position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring.  This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In Antibiotics III.  Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-.11 (1975); Hurley and Needhair.-VanDevanter, Ace. Chem. Res., 19, 230-237 (1906)).  Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.<br>
The present  inventors  have previously disclosed,   in WO  00/12508, dimeric  cytotcxic  PBD  compounds   substituted  at  the  C2  position, for  example:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
The synthesis of these compounds was achieved by formation of the dimeric backbone comprising the assembled A and C rings linked through the A ring by the diether linking chain.  The N10 position was then protected with an Alloc group before a ring closure reaction to form the B ring and subsequent deprotection to give the product.  The key stage in this synthesis is described as the<br>
ring closure to form the B ring which occurs after the linking of r;he two A rings with the diether chain.<br>
Using this route, to synthesise a number of dinners having the same monomer groups but different bridging groups require the synthesis of each compound from scratch, i.e. the synthesis route is not .ible to readJ.ly produce a diverse collection of PBD dimers, where the diversity is in the dirtier bridge.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>

Carbamate-based nitrogen protecting groups<br>
Carbamate-based nitrogen protecting groups are well known in the<br>
art, and have the following structure:<br>
R'10-CK , 0<br>
wherein R'10 is R as defined above.  A large number of suitable groups are described on pages 503 to 549 of Greene, T.W. and Wuts, G.M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred protecting groups include Alloc, Troc, Fmoc, CBz, Teoc, BOG, Doc, Hoc, TcBOC, 1-Adoc and 2-Adoc.<br>
Also suitable for use in the present invention are nitrogen protecting group which can be removed in vivo (e.g. enzymatically, using light) as described in WO 00/12507, which is incorporated herein by reference-.  Examples of these protecting groups include:<br>
(Figure Remove)Oxygen protecting groups are well known in the art.  A large number of suitable groups are described on pages 23 to 200 of Greene, T.W. and Wuts, G.M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Classes of particular interest include silyl ethers, methyl ethers, alkyl ethers, benzyl ethers, esters, benzoates, carbonates, and sulfonates.<br>
Preferred oxygen protecting groups include TBS, THP for the Cll oxygen atom, and benzyl ether for the C7 or C8 oxygen atom (where present).<br>
As mentioned above the oxygen protecting group R14 should be orthogonal to the oxygen protecting group R11.  Protecting groups which are orthogonal to one another may each be removed using reagents or conditions which do not remove the other protecting qroup.<br>
It may also be preferred that any protecting groups used during i.he synthesis and use of compounds of formula I are orthogonal to one another.  However, it is often not necessary, but may be desirable, for the carbamate-based nitrogen protecting group and R11 to be orthogona.l to one another, depending on whether the compound of formula Ilia or Illb is to be used with the nitrogen protecting group in place.<br>

Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enaritiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forrns; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R~, S-, and rneso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and 1-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal-and anticlinal-forms; a- and (3-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "dsomeric forms").<br>
Preferably compounds of the present invention have the following stereochemistry at the Cll position:<br>
(Figure Remove)Note t.hat, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are structura] (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the; connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space) .  For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCI-U, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural i.'jomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH.  Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.  However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. C^ alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxypheriyl ) .<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto--, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitio.<br>
(Figure Remove)Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions.  For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H (D) , and 3H (T) ; C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; 0 may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 1B0; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such :i someric forms, including (wholly or partiaJly) racern.ic end other mixtures thereof.  Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms cire either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods '.aught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, et al, , J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977).<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.  Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Alt3.  Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH/} and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NH3R+, NH2R2*, NHR3+, NR4+) .  Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, djethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylarnine, et.hylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamjne, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.  An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)/.<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g. ~NH2 may be -NH3+) , then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion.  Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acrid.--,: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.<br>
Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutaraic, glycolic, hydroxymaJeic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesu.! fonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluener.ulfonic, and valeric.  Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
A particular salt form of interest can be formed from compounds of formula Ilia and Illb, where R10 and R15 form an imine bond, by reacting said compound with a bisulphite salt to form a bisulphite derivative of the PBD. These compounds can be represented as:<br>
(Figure Remove)M arid M' are independently monovalent pharmaceutically acceptable cations, or together form a divalent pharmaceutically acceptable cation, and the other groups are as previously defined.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound.  The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute- (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a rii-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
Solvates of particular relevance to the present invention are those where the solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety, which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol (RhOH, where RB is an ether substituent as described above) :<br>
(Figure Remove)These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms 01 the PBD.  The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found, as well as the nature of the moiety itself.<br>
In general any nucleophilic solvent is capable of forming such solvat.es as illustrated above for hydroxylic solvents.  Other nucleophilic solvents include thiols and amines.<br>
These soivates may be isolated in solid form, for example, by lyophilisation .<br>
Gen e ra ]<br>
The syrithes: r- of PBD compounds is extensively discussed in WO 00/12508, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As discussed in that patent application, a key step in a preferred route to PBDs is a cyclisation to produce the B-ring, involving generation of an aldehyde (or functional equivalent thereof) at what will be the ]l-position, and attack thereon by the Pro-NlO-nitrogen:<br>
(Figure Remove)wherein the substituents are as defined in the second aspect of the invention and R12 and R13 are either OR" and RA respectively or RA and OR1" repectively i.e. the protected hydroxyl group may be at either the C7 or C8 position with the other position being RA.  The "masked aldehyde" -CPQ may be an acetal or thioacetal, in which case the cyclisation involves unmasking.  Alternatively, it may be an alcohol -CHOH, in which case the reaction involves oxidation, e.g. by means of TPAP, TEMPO or DMSO (Swern oxidation).<br>
The masked aldehyde compound can be produced by condensing a corresponding 2,4-substituted pyrrolidine with a 2-nitrobenzoic acid: (Figure Remove)<br><br>
The n.itro group can then be reduced to -NH2 and protected by reaction with a suitable agent, e.g. a chloroformate, which provides the removable nitrogen protecting group in the compound of formula IV.<br>
A process Involving the oxidation-cyclization procedure is illustrated in scheme 1 (an alternative type of cyclisation will be described later with reference to scheme 2).<br><br>
(Figure Remove)Exposure of the alcohol (B) (in which the Pro-NlO-nitrogen is generally protected as carbamate) to tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TFAP) /N-methylrnorpholine N-oxide (NMO) over A4 sieves results in oxidation accompanied by spontaneous B-ring closure to afford the desired product IV.  The TPAP/NMO oxidation procedure .is found to be particularly convenient for small scale reactions while the use of DMSO-based oxidation methods, particularly Swern oxidation, proves superior for larger scale work (e.g. &gt; 1 g) .  A particularly preferred oxidising agent is (diacetoxyiodoibenzene (1.1 eq) and TEMPO (0.1 eq) dissolved in CH2C12.<br>
The uncyclized alcohol (B) may be prepared by the reaction of a nitrogen protection reagent of formula D, which is preferably a chlorofurinate or acid chloride, to a solution of the amino alcohol C, generally in solution, generally in the presence of a base such as pyridine (preferably 2 equivalents) at a moderate temperature (e.g. at. 0°C).  Under these conditions little or no 0-acylation is usually observed.<br>
The key amino alcohol C may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro compound E, by choosing a method which will leave the rest: of the molecule intact.  Treatment of E with tin (II) chloride in a suitable solvent, e.g. refluxing methanol, generally affords, after the removal of the tin salts, the desired product in high yield.<br>
Exposure of E to hydrazine/Raney nickel avoids the production of tin salts and may result in a higher yield of C, although this method is less compatible with the range of possible C and A-ring substituents.  For instance, if there is  C-ring unsaturation (either in the ring itself, or in R2 or R3), this technique may be unsuitable.<br>
The nit.ro compound ot formula E may be prepared by coupling the appropriate o- ru trohenzoyl chloride to a compound of formula F, e.g. in the presence of K.2CG3 at -25 °C under a N2 atmosphere. Compounds of formula F can be readily prepared, for example by o!l efination of the ketone derived from L-trans-hydroxy proline. The ketone intermediate can also be exploited by conversion to the enol triflate for use in palladium mediated coupling reactions.<br>
The o-nitrobenzoyl chloride is synthesised from the o-nitrobenzoic acid (or alky.I. ester after hydrolysis) of formula G, which itself is prepared from the vanillic acid (or alkyl ester) derivative H. Many of these are commercially available and some are disclosed in Althuls, T.H. and Hess, H.J., J. Medicinal Chem., 20(1), 146-266 (1977).<br>
(Figure Remove) the final or penultimate step was an oxidative cyclisation.  An alternative, using thioacetal coupling, is shown in scheme 2.  Mercury-mediated unmasking causes cyclisation to the protected PBD compound IV.<br>
The thioacetal compound may be prepared as shown in scheme 2:  the thioacetal protected C-ring [prepared via a literature method: Langley, D.R. &amp; Thurston, D.E., J. Organic Chemistry, 52, 91-97 (1987)] is coupled to the o-nitrobenzoic acid (or alkyl ester after hydrolysis) (G) using a literature procedure.  The resulting nitro compound cannot be reduced by hydrogenation, because of the<br>
thioaceta] group,, so the tin (II) chloride method is used to afford the amine.  Thir, as then N-protected, e.g., by reaction with a r:hloroiormate or acid chloride, such as 2,2,2-Lr:i chl or oe thy .Lchlor ;.; formate .<br>
Acetal-containing C-rings can be used as an alternative in this type of route with deprotection involving other methods, including the use of acidic conditions.<br>
Alternative routes to PBDs<br>
Alternative methods of synthesising N10 protected PBDs are<br>
disclosed jn co-pending application PCT/GB2004/003873 (filed 10<br>
September 2004) which claims priority from GB0321295.8 (filed 11<br>
September 2003), which describes the use of isocyanate<br>
i intermediates,<br>
Formation of compounds Ilia and Illb (Scheme 3}<br>
(Figure Remove)Formation of the protected compound Illb dimer from compound Ib is illustrated, however, protected compound Ilia is formed in an analogous manner with compound la as the starting material.<br>
The PBD dimer compound Ilia or Illb may be synthesized by dimerisation of compounds of formula la or Ib respectively following deprotection of the OH group at either the C7 or C8 position.  The synthesis route illustrated in scheme 3 shows compounds when the dimer linkage is of the formula -0-(CH2) n~0-.<br>
The protected dimer Ilia or Illb may be formed from compounds of formula la or Ib respectively through reaction with a disubscitut.eti linking chain.  The linking chain is preferably of the genera.1. form Y-R"-Y' where R" is as previously defined and Y and Y' are gioupt which can be reacted with an alcohol to form an ether linkage;.  Y and Y' are preferably independently selected from 1, Br, 01, OH, mesylate or tosylate.  In a preferred aspect, Y and Y' are the same.  In a preferred aspect Y and Y' are both i.odo- groups<br>
Where Y and/or Y' j.s 1, Br, Cl, mesylate or tosylate, the Y-R"-Y' reactant is coupled to the compound of formula la or Ib by a simple elimination reaction with Y and Y' as leaving groups.  For example where che linking chain is -O-CHj-CHg-CHj-O-, the compound of formula la or Ib is reacted with 1,3-diiodopropane in the presence of K2C03.  Generally, where the linking chain is a straight chain alkyl ether of the form -0-(CH2) n-0-, the compound of formula la or Ib is preferably reacted with the corresponding I, n-diiodoalkane.<br>
Where Y and/or Y' is OH, the Y-R"-Y' reactant is coupled to the compound of formula la or Ib under Mitsunobu conditions.<br>
It .is important that the OH protecting group at Cll in formula la or Ib is orthogonal to the OH protecting group at C7 and/or C8. This allows the 07 and/or C8 protection to be removed to give the free alcohol to allow dimerisation whilst the Cll OH group remains protected arid therefore unreactive under the dimerisation conditions.<br>
Following dimerisation, the inline bond in the compound of formula Illb-prot can be deprotected by standard methods to yield the unprotected compound Illb (which may be in its carbinolamine or carboinolamine ether form , depending on the solvents used).  For example if R10 is Alloc, then the deprotection is carried using palladium to remove the N10 protecting group, followed by the<br>
elimination of water.  If R10 is Troc, then the deprotection is carried out  a Cd/Pb couple to yield the compound of formula Illb.<br>
Compound Ilia may be formed in an analogous manner via deprotection ol t:he protected inline.<br>
If the nitrogen protecting group (R10) is such that the desired end product still contains it, e.g. if it is removable in vivo, then the Cll deprotected forms of compounds of formula Ilia or Illb may he synthesised by removal of the oxygen protecting groups under suitable cond.ii.donr, to leave the R10 group in unaffected.<br>
The above de.seribed methods are suited to the synthesis of dimers where both the PBD monomers have the same substituent pattern. One method of synthesising a dimer where the substituent pattern of the two PBO monomers is not the same involves protecting one end of the compound Y-R"-Y' (or using an already protected compound) , coupling a PBD monomer to the unprotected end, deprotect: ing the other end and coupling a different PBD monomer to the free end.  This route is shown in scheme 4.<br>
(Figure Remove)Where YProt, is a protected version, or precursor to If Y' is protected then the protecting group used should be orthogonal to those on the rest of the molecule, in particular, R10 and R11.  One example of this route, would be to have Y as -OH and YProt as -0-benzyl. The first monomer could be joined by Mitsunobu coupling, the benzyl hydroxy deprotected, and then the free hydroxy coupled :o the second monomer by a further Mitsunobu reaction.<br>
Compound of formula Ja or Ib<br><br>
(Figure Remove)Following cyclisatJon to form the B-ring, the Cll-alcohol IV is then preferably protected, by conventional means to provide II. For example, if P.11 .is THP, the protection can take place by reacting IV with dihydropyran (DHP) and catalytic p-toluene sulfonic acid.  Cleavage of the C7 or CB-protecting group from II then provider, the corresponding C7 or C8 alcohol.  For example, where the C7 or C8 protecting group (R12 or R13) is a benzyl ether, th.i s deprotection may be performed by reaction with H2 catalysed by palladium on carbon.<br>
This protection at the Cll position and deprotection of the C7 or C8 alcohol allows subsequent reaction of selectively the C7 or C8 alcohol position, for example to form the dimer compound Ilia or Illb leaving the Cll position unaffected.<br>

Example 27 - Determination of DMA Cross-Linking ability and in vitro Cytotoxicity<br>
(a) DNA Cross-linking<br>
The extent; of DNA cross-linking induced by each PBD dimer was determined using the electrophoretic assay method of Hartley, et al. (Hartley, 0. A., Berardini, M. D., and Souhami, R. L. (1991) Ana] . Diochem. '19j, 131-134) based on the principle that, follow.i ng complete denaturation of linear pBR322 DNA (-4,300 bp) to the sing]e-stranded (SS) form, an interstrand cross-link results in renaturation to double-stranded (DS) in a neutral gel.<br>
Closed-circular DMA was linearized with Hindlll, then dephosphoryiated and finally 5'-singly end-labelled using [y32P]-ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Reactions containing 30-40 ng of DNA and the test, compound were carried out in aqueous TEOA (25 rnM triethanolanune, 3 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) buffer at 37°C in a final volume of 50 }d for 2 hours. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of stop solution (0.6 M NaOAc, 20 mM EDTA, 100 ug/ml tRNA) followed by precipitation with ethanol. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet dried by lyophilization. Samples were re-suspended in 10 u.1 of strand separation buffer (30% DMSO, 1 mM EDTA, 0.04% bromophenol blue and 0.04% xylene cylanol) and denatured by heating to 90°C for 2.5 miri, followed by immersion in an ice/water bath. Control non-denatured samples were re-suspended in 10 ul of non-denaturing buffer solution '(0.6% sucrose, 0.04% bromophenol blue in aqueous TAB buffer 140 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.1]) and loaded directly onto the gel for comparison.<br>
Electrophoresis was carried out for 14-16 h at 40 V using a 0.8% submerged agarose gel (20 * 25 x 0.5 cm) in TAB buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum for 2 hour at 80°C onto one layer each of<br>
Whatman 3MM and DE81 filter papers using a BioRad 583 gel dryer. Ante-radiographs were obtained after exposure of Hyperfilm-MP film (Amersham pic, O.K.) to the dried gel for either 4 hour with a screen (or over night, without a screen, to obtain a sharper image). Film bands were quantitated using a BioRad GS-670 imaging laser densitometer. Percentage cross-linking was calculated by measuring the total DNA in each lane (summed density for the double-stranded [DS] and single-stranded [SS] bands) relative to the amount of cross-linked DNA (density of DS band alone). A dose-response curve was derived by plotting drug concentration against the determined percentage level of cross-linked DNA which was then analysed to determine the concentration of test compound that results in 50% cross-linked plasmid DNA (XL50) .<br>
(b) In vitro cytoxicity<br>
(i)_K562 cells K562 human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells were maintained in RPM1<br>
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02 and were incubated with a specified dose of drug for 1 hour or 96 hours at 37°C in the dark. The incubation was terminated by centrifugation (5 min, 300 g) and the cells were washed once with drug-free medium. Following the appropriate drug treatment, the cells were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates (lO0 cells per well, 8 wells per sample).  Plates were then kept in the dark at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02. The assay is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a yellow soluble tetrazoliurn salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2tf-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Aldrich-Sigma), to an insoluble purple formaean precipitate, following incubation of the plates for 4 days (to allow control cells to increase in number by approximately 10 fold) , 20 uL of MTT solution (5 mg/raL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well and the plates further incubated for 5 hours. The plates were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 g and the bulk of the medium pipetted from the cell pellet leaving 10-20 uL per well.  DMSO (200 uL) was<br>
added to each well and the samples agitated to ensure complete mixing. The optica] density was then read at a wavelength of 550 nm on a Titertek Multiscan ELISA plate reader, and a dose-response curve was constructed.  For each curve, an IC50 value was read as the dost required to reduce the final optical density to 50% of the control value.<br>
(ii) NCI 60 cell screen<br>
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, Maryland, USA has available an in vitro cytotoxicity screen which consists of approximately 60 human tumour cell lines against which compounds are tested at a minimum of five concentrations each differing 10-fold.  A 48 hour continuous exposure protocol is used, where cell viability or growth is estimated with an SRB protein assay.<br>
The test compounds were evaluated against approximately 60 human tumour cell lines.  The NCI screening procedures were described in detail by Monks and co-workers (Monks, A et a 1. , Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 1991, 83, 757).  Briefly, cell suspensions were diluted according to the particular cell type and the expected target cell density (5000-40,000 cells per well based on cell growth characteristics), and added by pipette (100 uL) into 96-well microtitre plates.  The cells were allowed a preincubation period of 24 hours at 37°C for stabilisation. Dilutions at twice the intended test concentration were added at time zero in 100 uL aliquots to the wells.  The test compounds were evaluated at five 10-fold dilutions (10"", 10's, 10~6, 10"7 and 10'"8 uM) .  The test compounds were incubated for 48 hours in 5% C02 atmosphere and 100% humidity.  The cells were then assayed using the sulphorhodamine B assay.  A plate reader was used to read the optical densities and a microcomputer processed the readings into GIio values (in Moles), which is the dosage required to limit cell growth to 50%.(Table Remove)<br><br><br><br><br>
