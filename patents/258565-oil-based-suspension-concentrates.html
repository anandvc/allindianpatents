				<td>Oil-based suspension concentrates<br>
The present invention relates to new, oil-based suspension concentrates of active agrochemical substances, to a process for producing these formulations and to their use for applying the active substances comprised.<br>
Numerous water-free suspension concentrates of active agrochemical substances have already been disclosed. For instance EP-A 0 789 999 describes formulations of this type which in addition to active substance and oil comprise a mixture of different surfactants - including some which serve as penetrants - and also a hydrophobicized aluminophyllosilicate thickener. The stability of these preparations is good. A disadvantage, however, is the mandatory presence of a thickener, since it makes production more complex. Moreover, the thickener absorbs in each case some of the added amount of penetrant,'which is therefore unavailable for its proper function.<br>
From US-A 6 165 940, moreover, non-aqueous suspension concentrates are already known in which besides active agrochemical substance, penetrant and surfactant or surfactant mixture there is an organic solvent, suitable solvents of this type including liquid paraffin or vegetable oil esters. The biological activity and/or crop tolerance and/or the stability of the spray liquors preparable from these formulations by dilution with water is, however, not always sufficient.<br>
DE-A10129855 describes further oil-based suspension concentrates comprising active agrochemical substances, penetrants and surfactants.<br>
The penetrants described in the abovementioned patent applications are "open" alkanol alkoxylates.<br>
New oil-based suspension concentrates have now been found which are composed of at least one room-temperature-solid active agrochemical substance, at least one "closed" penetrant,at least one vegetable oil or mineral oil,<br>
at least one nonionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants and/or inert filler materials.<br>
Additionally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be produced by mixing<br>
at least one room-temperature-solid active agrochemical substance,<br>
at least one "closed" penetrant,<br>
at least one vegetable oil or mineral oil,<br>
at least one nonionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
optionally one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants and/or inert filler materials<br>
with one another and optionally subsequently grinding the resultant suspension.<br>
Finally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are highly suitable for applying the active agrochemical substances comprised to plants and/or their habitat.<br>
It is to be considered extremely surprising that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention exhibit a very good stability despite containing no thickener. Also unexpected is the fact that they display a better biological activity and/or crop tolerance than the existing formulations most similar in composition. Surprisingly, moreover, in terms of their activity, the oil-based suspension concentrates of theBCS 03-3105 Foreign Countries<br>
invention also surpass similar preparations • which besides the other components contain either only penetrant or only vegetable oil. No such synergistic effect was foreseeable from the above-described prior art.<br>
Furthermore, it is very surprising that the "closed" penetrants display a better biological activity than the corresponding "open" penetrants.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are also notable for a series of advantages. For instance, their production is less complex than the preparation of corresponding formulations in which thickeners are present. A further advantage is that, when the concentrates of the invention are diluted with water, there is neither significant creaming nor disruptive flocculation, which is frequently the case with existing preparations of this kind. Finally, the formulations of the invention promote the biological activity of the active components comprised, so that in comparison to conventional preparations either a higher activity is obtained or less active substance is needed.<br>
Solid, active agrochemical substances in the present context are all substances which are usual in the treatment of plants and whose melting point is above 20°C.

The amount of the individual components can be varied within a relatively wide range in the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention. Thus the concentrationsof active agrochemical substance are generally between 5% and '30%, preferably between 10% and 25% by weight,of "closed" penetrant are generally between 5% and 30%, preferably between 15% and 25% by weight,of vegetable oil or mineral oil are generally between 20% and 55%, preferably between 25% and 50% by weight,of surfactants are generally between 2.5% and 30%, preferably between 5.0% and 25% by weight, and of additives are generally between 0% and 25%, preferably between 0% and 20% by weight.The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are produced by mixing the components with one another in the respectively desired proportions. The order in which the constituents are combined with one another is arbitrary. Appropriately the solid components are used in a finely ground state. It is, however, also possible to subject the suspension which results after the constituents have been combined first to a coarse grinding and then to a fine grinding, so that the mean particle size is below 20 |-im. Preferred suspension concentrates are those in which the solid particles have a mean size between 1 and 10 μm.<br>
The temperatures when carrying out the process of the invention can be varied within a certain range. The work is carried out generally at temperatures between 10°C and 60°C, preferably between 15°C and 40°C. Equipment suitable for carrying out the process of the invention includes customary mixing and grinding apparatus which is used for producing agrochemical formulations.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention constitute formulations which remain stable even following prolonged storage at elevated temperatures or in the cold, since no crystal growth is observed. By dilution with water they can beconverted into homogeneous spray liquids/ These spray liquids are applied by customary methods, i.e., for example, by spraying, pouring or injecting.The application rate of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular active agrochemical substances and by their amount in the formulations.<br>
With the aid of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention it is possible to deliver active agrochemical substances to plants and/or their habitat in a particularly advantageous way. The active agrochemical substances included develop a better biological activity (in particular a better agrochemical activity and/or better -crop tolerance) than in the case of application in the form of the corresponding conventional formulations.<br>
In accordance with the invention it is possible to treat all plants and plant parts. By plants here are meant all plants and plant populations, such as desirable and unwanted wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and gene-technological methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. By plant parts are to be meant all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, an exemplary listing embracing leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubersnd rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and also vegetative and generative propagation material, examples being seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and plant parts in accordance with the invention with the suspension concentrates is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area in accordance with the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, squirting, evaporating, atomizing, or brush application<br>
and, in the case of propagation material, especially seeds, additionally by single or multiple coating.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and their parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. In one preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant varieties, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and also parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment transgenic plants and plant varieties, which have been obtained by gene-technological methods in combination where appropriate with conventional methods (genetic modified organisms), and parts thereof, are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been elucidated above.<br>
With particular preference, plants of the plant varieties that are in each case available commercially or in use are treated in accordance with the invention. By plant varieties are meant plants having novel properties (traits) which have been bred by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be varieties, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition) the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive (synergistic) effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or extensions in the spectrum of action and/or an increase in the effect of the substances and compositions that can be used in accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low' temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water content or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvesting yields, greater quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher storage capacity and/or processing capability of the harvested products are possible that go beyond the effects that were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic (i.e., obtained by gene technology) plants or plant varieties for treatment in accordance with the invention include all plants which by virtue of the gene-technological modification received genetic material which endows these<br>
plants with particularly advantageous, valuable traits. Examples of such -traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water content or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvesting yields, greater quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher storage capacity and/or processing capability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a heightened defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to particular active herbicidal substances. Examples of transgenic plants include the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape, beet, sugar cane and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), particular emphasis being given to maize, soya, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits given particular emphasis are the heightened defence of the plants against insects, by means of toxins which form in the plants, particularly those generated in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations thereof) ("Bt plants" below). Further traits given particular emphasis are the increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses as a result of Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and also resistance genes, and proteins and toxins expressed accordingly. Further traits given particular emphasis include the increased tolerance of the plants to certain active herbicidal substances, examples being imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (e.g. "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in each case may also occur in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples that may be mentioned of "Bt plants" include maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (e.g. maize, cotton, soya), KnockOut® (e.g. maize), StarLink® (e.g. maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples that may be mentioned of herbicide-tolerant plants include maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, e.g. maize, cotton, soya), Liberty Link® (tolerance<br>
to phosphinotricin, e.g. oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, e.g. maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (bred conventionally for herbicide tolerance) that may be mentioned also include the varieties (e.g. maize) sold under the name Clearfield®. It will be appreciated that these remarks also apply to plant varieties to be developed in the future or to appear on the market in the future and possessing these genetic traits or genetic traits developed in the future.<br>
The plants recited can be treated with particular advantage with the suspension concentrates of the invention. The ranges of preference indicated above for the suspension concentrates also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis may be given to the treatment of plants with the suspension concentrates recited specifically in the present text.<br>

Example I<br>
Test description: penetrants at the level of the cuticle<br>
Additives which act as penetrants at the level of the cuticle may be referred to below as accelerator additives (cf. Schonherr and Baur, 1994, Pesticide Science 42, 185-208). The feature of accelerator additives is their ability to penetrate from the aqueous spray liquor and/or from the spray covering into the cuticle and thereby to increase the mobility of active substances in the cuticle. Other additives such as polyethylene glycol, in contrast, act only in the spray covering (via the liquid phase) or act only as wetting agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, for example.<br>
This test determines the influence of additives on the penetration properties of other substances at the level of the cuticle. The mobility of the test substance in the cuticle is -measured with and without an additive, by way of a desorption method. The method is published in detail in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science, 51, 131-152) and only the principles and any deviations are described below. As a test substance with the function of a tracer a selection was made here of a radiolabelled weak organic acid. Plant material used comprised the enzymatically isolated leaf cuticles of the top face of peach leaves from outdoor trees. The cuticles were installed in specially manufactured stainless steel diffusion cells. The tracer, in a citrate buffer at a pH of 3 in the dissolved state, was applied to the side originally' facing the inside of the leaf. This inner side readily takes up the small radioactive amount of the tracer in the undissociated acid form. Subsequently this inner side was covered and maintained at 100% atmospheric humidity. The morphological outer side of the leaf cuticle, normally exposed to the air, was then contacted with a buffer (pH 7), with the receptor solution, and the desorption was started. The penetrated acid form of the test substance is dissociated by the receptor and the desorption follows first-order kinetics. The desorption constant is proportional to the mobility of the tracer in the cuticle.<br>
After at least 2 times for determining this constant, the desorption is then continued with a buffer which additionally includes the test additive. Depending on the property of the additive there is then sorption of the additive in the cuticle and, depending on its activity as a plasticizer for the cuticle, there is an increase in the mobility of the tracer within the cuticle. This is manifested in an increased desorption constant, and the ratio of the slopes with additive to that without additive describes the effect of the additive to act as a penetrant at the level of the cuticle. The comparison of the average effect of different additives shows their effectiveness at acting as cuticle plasticizers.<br>
Result:<br>
Effect of closed (methylated) and open (non-methylated) additives on the mobility of active substance (here, a weak organic acid) in the cuticle. Additives used were a methylated or non-methylated isotridecyl-(6) ethoxylate and the abovementioned penetrants Ie-1 and Ie-2 and also their open forms le'-l and Ie'-2.<br>
Additive	Average effect      SE (standard error)<br>
Isotridecyl-(6) ethoxylate, open	42.3	9.3<br>
Isotridecyl-(6) ethoxylate, closed	78.9	21.5<br>
Ie'-l,open	9.0	1.8<br>
Ie-1 (= closed)	78.4	26.1 (additive from Example 2)<br>
Ie'-2, open	45.1	14.3<br>
Ie-2, (= closed)	89.1	19.1 (additive from Example 1)'<br>
Example II<br>
Penetration test<br>
This test measures the penetration of active substances through enzymatically isolated cuticles of apple leaves.The leaves used are cut in the fully developed state from apple trees of the Golden Delicious variety. The cuticles are isolated as follows:<br>
first of all, leaf discs labelled on the underside with dye and formed by punching were filled by means of vacuum infiltration with a pectinase solution (0.2% to 2% strength) buffered to a pH of between 3 and 4,<br>
then sodium azide was added and the leaf discs thus treated were left to stand until the original leaf structure broke down and the non-cellular cuticle underwent detachment.<br>
Thereafter only those cuticles from the top leaf sides that were free from stomata and hairs were used. They were washed a number of times in alternation with water and with a buffer solution, pH 7. The clean cuticles obtained were, finally, applied to Teflon plaques, smoothed with a gentle jet of air, and dried.<br>
In the next step the cuticular membranes obtained in this way were place in stainless steel diffusion cells (= transport chambers) for the purpose of membrane transport investigations. For these investigations the cuticles were placed centrally using tweezers on the edges of the diffusion cells, which were coated with silicone grease, and sealed with a ring, which was likewise greased. The arrangement is chosen so that the morphological outer face of the cuticles is directed outwards, in other words to the air, while the original inner side is facing the interior of the diffusion cell. The diffusion cells are filled with water or with a mixture of water and solvent.<br>
Penetration is determined by applying lOμl of a spray liquor, containing 0.1 g/1 active substance, of the formulations indicated below, to the outer face of each cuticle<br>
Mains water is used in each of the spray liquors.<br>
After the spray liquors have been applied' the water is evaporated in each-case and then the chambers are inverted and placed in thermostated troughs, with air of a defined humidity and temperature being blown onto the outer face of the cuticle in each case. The penetration which begins therefore takes place at a relative atmospheric humidity of 60% and a set temperature of 20°C. At regular intervals, samples are taken using a syringe and the amount of penetrated active substance is measured.<br>
The results of the experiment are apparent from the tables. The figures shown are averages of 5 measurements.<br>
