DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The levels of isoleucine analogue of valine were analyzed by GC. The levels of Isoleucine analogue in valsartan were analyzed by HPLC.<br>
The presence of impurities in valsartan may pose a problem for formulation in that impurities often affect the safety and shelf  life of a formulation. The present invention provides a method for ameliorating the effect of a single impurity present in formulations of valsartan by reducing the amount of the impurity during synthesis. The impurity, the isoleucine analogue of L-valine, has not been disclosed in the literature and has the following structure:<br><br>
Two samples of  Valsartan were prepared by the described procedure (examples 1-3) of the present invention from Valine Methyl ester of different suppliers. The sample from supplier A contained 0.131% as area percentage GC of isoleucine methyl ester and the sample from supplier B (Kony Pharma China) contained 0.07% as area percentage GC of the ester by GC as area percentage (for method see analytical part). The Valsartan prepared from valine methyl ester of supplier A contained 0.13% as area percentage HPLC of isoleucine analogue and valsartan prepared from supplier B contained 0.07 % as area percentage HPLC of the isoleucine analogue (for HPLC method see analytical part). These results are in good correlation with GC data of the starting Valine Methyl Esters, suggesting that the isoleucine impurity present in the starting material would also be present in the final product in the same ratio.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing valsartan having a low level of the isoleucine analogue as an impurity by checking for the impurity in the starting material and choosing starting material which has a low level of the impurity. See e.g. WO/03070246, incorporated herein by reference, in one embodiment, a sample of VLS-07 having a level of the impurity of NMT about 0.1% as area<br>
percentage GC, more preferably NMT about 0.07% is chosen. The relative retention time (RRT) of the isoleucine analogue of VLS-07 compared to VLS-02 is 1.2. Instead of choosing VLS-07, other batches of intermediates such as VLS-04 and VLS-05 may be tested for the amount of the impurity, and the batches discarded if the requisite amount of impurity is not met.<br>
If the requisite amount of impurity is not met, it may be possible to purify the starting material or intermediates by techniques such as crystallization. See e.g. WO/03070246.<br>
The method of the present invention may be applied to any synthesis method known in the art, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,578. In a preferred embodiment illustrated in the present invention, the synthesis of valsartan is carried out by reacting a 5-(4'bromomemylbiphenyl-2-yl)-lH-tetrazole with an L-valine derivative substantially free of its isoleucine analogue. The L-valine derivative may be any suitable derivative, including but not limited to addition salts, ethers and esters of L-valine. Preferred esters include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl (including t-butyl), benzyl and aryl esters. A most preferred ester is a C1 to C4 alkyl ester, particularly methyl or t-butyl ester.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent. Examples of preferred organic solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMA), toluene, hexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), diethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), benzene, m-xylene, ethyl acetate, o-xylene, tetralins, formals, glymes and mixtures thereof. Other hydrocarbons useful in the practice of the present invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan.<br>
The synthesis of valsartan of the present invention may include the step of reacting a 5-(4'bromomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-lH-tetrazole with an L-valine derivative. A preferred 5-(4'bromomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-lH-tetrazole is 5-(4'bromomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole (VLS-02). A preferred L-valine derivative is L-valine methyl ester (VLS-07). The step is carried out in an organic solvent reaction system. To the organic solvent is added an amount of a basic material. The basic material may be a carbonate salt of an alkali metal or an organic base. Preferred salts of alkali metals include<br>
sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Preferred organic bases include triethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethylamine and diethylamine. As described above the organic solvent is preferably selected from DMF, DMA, toluene, hexane, DME, diethoxymethane, THF, benzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, ethyl acetate, tetralins, fomials, glymes and mixtures thereof. A most preferred organic solvent is acetonitrile. The reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of a catalyst. Preferred solvents for use with a phase transfer catalyst are toluene and ethyl acetate. VLS-07 is added to the solvent/b ase mixture. VLS-02 is added, preferentially in three separate portions, to the reaction mixture, and the resulting reaction mixture is heated with agitation for a reaction time of between 1 to 6 hours.<br>
After the reaction time, the reaction system is cooled, and the solvent is removed to yield the crude residue of N-valine methyl ester 5-(4'methylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole reaction product (VLS-04). Typically the solvent is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure.<br>
In addition to bromine in VLS-02, other leaving groups may be utilized, including other halogens such as chlorine, or sulfonates. The acylating agent used may also include other leaving groups.<br>
In a second step of the synthetic method of the present invention, the N-valine methyl ester 5-(4'methylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole reaction product (VLS-04) is reacted with an acylating agent to form a valsartan precursor such as (S)-N-(l-carboxymethoxy-2-methyl-prop-l-yl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'-(l-trityl-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)bi phenyl-4-yl methyl]-amine (VLS-05). Crude residue produced in the synthetic step described above is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent. The organic solvent preferably contains an amount of an organic basic material. Preferred organic basic materials include triethylamine and tributylamine. Preferred organic solvents include toluene, DMA, DMF, hexane and acetonitrile. A most preferred organic solvent is dry toluene. To the resulting solution is added an acylating agent. Preferably the acylating agent is valeroyl chloride. The resulting mixture is agitated at room temperature for a period of from about 12 to about 24 hours. Preferably the reaction mixture is agitated for a period of about 20 hours. The time of the acylation reaction can be conveniently monitored using thin layer<br><br>
chromatography. Following completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is neutralized with a molar excess of base, preferably aqueous NaHCO3, and the resulting two-phase reaction system is separated. The organic phase is washed and dried, and the reaction product, (S )-N-(l -carboxymethoxy-2-methyl-prop-1 -yl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'-(l -trityl-1 H-tefrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yI methyl]-amine, (VLS-05), separated out. The separation may be carried out by any known method, but is Typically carried out by evaporation under reduced pressure. The reaction product may be purified by, for example, chromatographic means, prior to further use in the synthesis.<br>
In a third step of the synthetic method of the present invention the protecting groups., e.g., the trityl group attached to the tetrazole ring and the L-valine substituent (such as the methyl ester group of L-valine methyl ester (VLS-07)), can be cleaved to produce valsartan (VLS-00), or an analogue thereof. Crude residue produced in the synthetic step described above is dissolved in a suitable water-miscible solvent. A solvent is water miscible if it is miscible with water at least in any proportion from 80:20 to 20:80 (weight basis). Preferred water-miscible solvents include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane and C1 to C4 alcohols. Acetone is a most preferred water-miscible solvent. The resulting solution is acidified and agitated at a temperature of from about 0°C to about 40°C. Most preferably the temperature is about room temperature. The time of the cleavage reaction can be conveniently monitored using thin layer chromatography. An aqueous solution of a basic material is added and the water-miscible solvent is evaporated, preferably at reduced pressure. Suitable basic materials include potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and sodium hydroxide. The trityl alcohol formed is separated and the liquid phase is acidified by addition of a suitable acid to a pH of about 3. Preferred acids include mineral acids, hydrogen sulfate, trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, hydrobrormic acid and acetic acid. A most preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. The resulting suspension is extracted with ethyl acetate and the crude product, for example, (S)-N-(l-carboxymethoxy-2-methyl-prop-l-yl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl methyl]-amine, (VLS-06), recovered by, for example, evaporation under reduced pressure. The resulting product is dissolved in an organic solvent. Preferred organic solvents include organic alcohols, acetone and acetonitrile. A most preferred solvent is acetone. The resulting solution is cooled to a temperature of between about -10°C and about 45°C. Preferably the resulting solution is cooled to a<br><br>
temperature of between about 0°C and about 4°C. The acid Is neutralized with a molar excess of base, preferably aqueous KOH, and the water-miscible solvent is evaporated, preferably at reduced pressure. The time of the cleavage reaction can be conveniently monitored using thin layer chromatography or HPLC monitoring. The solution is extracted with ethyl acetate and acidified by addition of a suitable acid to a pH of about 3. Preferred acids include mineral acids, hydrogen sulfate, trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, hydrobromic acid and acetic acid. A most preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. The resulting suspension is cooled and the product recovered by, for example, filtration. If desired, the isolated product can be washed with water, and dried, preferably at reduced pressure.<br>
Some of the steps of the present invention may be carried out in one pot, as illustrated in the examples.<br>
The valsartan synthesized may be obtained as various polymorphic forms in the sold state. Such forms are disclosed in U.S. Appl. No. 60/455,286, Filed on March 17, 2003, entitled "Polymorphs of Valsartan and Processes for their Preparation", which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Crude valsartan may be crystallized from organic solvents such as dichloromethane, diethyl ether or ethyl acetate. In a preferred embodiment, valsartan is crystallized from ethyl acetate. When crude material is crystallized out of ethyl acetate, the dry material may contain about 2.7% ethyl acetate by weight after conventional drying. The present invention provides for removing residual organic solvent such as ethyl acetate from the crude material. The crude valsartan, either wet or dry, preferably wet, containing residual solvent is triturated in water, in order to remove the residual solvent to acceptable levels (according to the ICH guidelines the level is limited to less than about 5000 ppm). In one embodiment, after trituration in water, the level of the residual solvent is 3600 ppm. Preferably the trituration is performed from about 4 to about 50 °C, more preferably from about 25 to about 40°C. Preferably, the trituration is carried out for about 30 minutes to about 60 hours, more preferably from about 3 to about 20 hours.<br>
Another manner to remove residual solvent, particularly ethyl acetate, is by performing a solvent exchange by contacting the solvate with humid gas in a fluidized bed apparatus. As used herein, the term "humid" refers to a relative humidity of at least 30%, more preferably at least about 50% and most preferably at least about 80%. A suitable fluidized bed apparatus is Retsch TG-100.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations/compositions of the present invention contain crystalline valsartan, such as one of those disclosed in U.S. Appl. No. 60/455,286, Filed on March 17, 2003, entitled "Polymorphs of Valsartan and Processes for their Preparation", or valsartan purely amorphous, optionally in mixture with other fomi(s) of valsartan. The<br>
valsartan prepared by the processes of the present invention are ideal for pharmaceutical<br>
/ formulation since they are substantially free of the isoleucine analogue as an impurity. In<br>
addition to the active ingredient(s), the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may contain one or more excipients. Excipients are added to the composition for a variety of purposes.<br>
Diluents increase the bulk of a solid pharmaceutical composition, and may make a pharmaceutical dosage form containing the composition easier for the patient and care giver to handle. Diluents for solid compositions include, for example, microcrystalline. cellulose (e.g. Avicel®), microfine cellulose, lactose, starch, pregelatinized starch, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sugar, dextrates, dextrin: dextrose, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, tribasic calcium phosphate, kaolin, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, maltodextrin, mannitol, polymethacrylates (e.g. Eudragit®), potassium chloride, powdered cellulose, sodium chloride, sorbitol and talc.<br>
Solid pharmaceutical compositions that are compacted into a dosage form, such as a tablet, may include excipients whose functions include helping to bind the active ingredient and other excipients together after compression. Binders for solid pharmaceutical compositions include acacia, alginic acid, carbomer (e.g. carbopol), carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethyl cellulose, gelatin, guar gum, hydrogenated vegetable oil, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose (e.g. Klucel®), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (e.g. Methocel®), liquid glucose, magnesium aluminum<br>
silicate, maltodextrin, methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, povidone (e.g. Kollidon®, Plasdone®), pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate and starch.<br>
The dissolution rate of a compacted solid pharmaceutical composition in the patient's stomach may be increased by the addition of a disintegrant to the composition. Disintegrants include alginic acid, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium (e.g. Ac-Di-Sol , Primellose ), colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone (e.g. Kollidon®, Polyplasdone®), guar gum, magnesium aluminum silicate, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin potassium, powdered cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium alginate, sodium starch glycolate (e.g. Explotab®) and starch.<br>

When a dosage form such as a tablet is made by the compaction of a powdered composition, the composition is subjected to pressure from a punch and dye. Some excipients and active ingredients have a tendency to adhere to the surfaces of the punch and dye, which can cause the product to have pitting and other surface irregularities. A lubricant can be added to the composition to reduce adhesion and ease the release of the product from the dye. Lubricants include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mineral oil, polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate, stearic acid, talc and zinc stearate.<br>
Flavoring agents and flavor enhancers make the dosage form more palatable to the patient. Common flavoring agents and flavor enhancers for pharmaceutical products that may be included in the composition of the present invention include maltol, vanillin, ethyl vanillin, menthol, citric acid, fumaric acid, ethyl maltol and tartaric acid.<br>
Solid and liquid compositions may also be dyed using any pharmaceutically acceptable colorant to improve their appearance and/or facilitate patient identification of the product and unit dosage level.<br>
In liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, valsartan and any other solid excipients are dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier such as water, vegetable oil, alcohol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerin.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions may contain emulsifying agents to disperse uniformly throughout the composition an active ingredient or other excipient that is not soluble in the liquid carrier. Emulsifying agents that may be useful in liquid compositions of the present invention include, for example, gelatin, egg yolk, casein, cholesterol, acacia, tragacanth, chondrus, pectin, methyl cellulose, carbomer, cetostearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also contain a viscosity enhancing agent to improve the mouth-feel of the product and/or coat the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Such agents include acacia, alginic acid bentonite, carbomer, carboxymethylcellulose calcium or sodium, cetostearyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, ethylcellulose, gelatin guar gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, maltodextrin, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, propylene carbonate, propylene glycol alginate, sodium alginate, sodium starch glycolate, starch tragacanth and xanthan gum.<br>
Sweetening agents such as sorbitol, saccharin, sodium saccharin, sucrose, aspartame, fructose, mannitol and invert sugar may be added to improve the taste.<br>
Preservatives and chelating agents such as alcohol, sodium benzoate, butylated hydroxy toluene, butylated hydroxyanisole and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid may be added at levels safe for ingestion to improve storage stability.<br>
According to the present invention, a liquid composition may also contain a buffer such as guconic acid, lactic acid, citric acid or acetic acid, sodium guconate, sodium<br>
lactate, sodium citrate or sodium acetate. Selection of excipients and the amounts used may be readily determined by the formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and reference works in the field.<br>
The solid compositions of the present invention include powders, granulates, aggregates and compacted compositions. The dosages include dosages suitable for oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable administration in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most preferred route of the present invention is oral. The dosages may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
Dosage forms include solid dosage forms like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and losenges, as well as liquid syrups, suspensions and elixirs.<br>
The dosage form of the present invention may be a capsule containing the composition, preferably a powdered or granulated solid composition of the invention, within either a hard or soft shell. The shell may be made from gelatin and optionally contain a plasticizer such as glycerin and sorbitol, and an opacifying agent or colorant.<br>
The active ingredient and excipients may be formulated into compositions and dosage forms according to methods known in the art.<br>
A composition for tableting or capsule filling may be prepared by wet granulation, hi wet granulation, some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid, typically water, that causes the powders to clump into granules. The granulate is screened and/or milled, dried and then screened and/or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tableted, or other excipients may be added prior to tableting, such as a glidant and/or a lubricant.<br>
A tableting composition may be prepared conventionally by dry blending. For example, the blended composition of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a<br>
slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The .compacted granules may subsequently be compressed into a tablet.<br>
As an alternative to dry granulation, a blended composition may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited for direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose, spray dried lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.<br>
A capsule filling of the present invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting, however, they are not subjected to a final tableting step.<br>
The solid compositions of the present invention include powders, granulates, aggregates and compacted compositions. The dosages include dosages suitable for oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most, preferred route of the present invention is oral. The dosages can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
The active ingredient and excipients may be formulated into compositions and dosage forms according to methods known in the art. The solid oral dosage forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,485,745 and 6,395,728 may be used as a guidance. The dosages and formulation of DIOVAN may also be used for guidance.

Preparation of Valsartan Example 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
VLS-02 (30.0 g, 54.0 mmol) was added in one portion to the suspension of L-Valine methyl ester (free base, VLS-07, 10.6 g, 81.0 mmol, 1.5 eq) and K2CO3 (59.5g, 4.3 mol, 8 eq) in dry Acetonitrile (200 mL) preheated to 50-60 °C. The reaction was stirred for 2-3 h at 70 °C under Argon, cooled to 0 °C and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 36.0 g of crude VLS-04 as sticky yellow oil that was used in the next step without any purification.<br>
Example 2<br>
To solution of VLS-04 (36.0 g, 54 mmol) and Triethylamine (16.4 g, 22.5 mL, 162 mmol, 3.0 eq) in dry Toluene (200 mL) Valeroyl chloride (16.3 g, 16.0mL, 0.135 mmol, 2.5 eq) was slowly added under Argon keeping the reaction temperature below 35°C. The resulted mixture was stirred for 10 h at room temperature and quenched with 10, % aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (100 mL). After stirring of 1 h at room temperature, the two-phase mixture was separated, the organic phase washed with 10% aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (50 mL) and brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to give 44.0 g (near quant) of crude VLS-05 as yellow semisolid.<br>
Example 3<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
VLS-05 (15.0 g, 21.7 mmol) was dissolved in Acetone (90 mL), H2SO4 (98%, 3.5 mL, ~3 eq) in Water (20 mL) was slowly added and the resulted cloud solution was stirred for 5 h at room temperature (TLC or HPLC monitoring). A solution of NaOH (5.2 g, 130.2 mmol, 6 eq) in Water (10 mL) was slowly added, the resulted suspension was stirred for 12 h at room temperature and Acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure. The precipitate (TPM) was filtered and washed with Water (20 mL); the combined aqueous filtrate washed twice with total 50 mL of EtOAc and slowly acidified to pH 2.5 with 3N aqueous H2SO4 The resulted suspension was extracted twice with EtOAc (total 120 mL), the combined orgam'cs were washed with brine and concentrated to 50 mL volume under reduced pressure. This solution was cooled down to 0-4 °C, stirred for 2 h and filtered to give 7.2 g of crude VLS-00 as a white solid. The crude was recrystallized from EtOAc afforded about 6.5 g of Valsartan as white powder.<br>
Example 4<br>
Two samples of VLS-07 were tested for the level of isoleucine impurity by gas chromatography. One sample showed an impurity of 0.07%, another sample 0.30%. The sample with 0.07% was selected for preparation of valsartan according to examples 1-3.<br>
Example 5<br>
