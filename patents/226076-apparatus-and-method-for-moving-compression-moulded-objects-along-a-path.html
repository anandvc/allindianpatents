				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns apparatus and method for moving compression moulded objects along a path, in particular for removing caps made of plastic material from a mould in which they have been formed by means of compression moulding.<br>
US 5807592 discloses an apparatus for producing caps provided with a plurality of moulds, each mould comprising a die in which a preset amount of plastic material in a fluid or semifluid state is fed, and further comprising a punch which interacts with the die so as to shape the plastic material in the fluid or semifluid state according to the desired shape of the cap.<br>
When the moulds are opened, a cap remains associated to each punch, the cap being associated to the respective punch near a hollow portion of said cap arranged for engaging with the neck of a bottle.<br>
The caps thus obtained are subsequently removed from the relative punches so as to fall, under the action of gravity, on an underlying circular plate of a transferring carousel. Here a star-disc, provided with arms that radially protrude from the body of the disc, directs the caps towards an exit area through a path along which the caps are guided by respective side guides.<br>
A drawback of the apparatus disclosed in US 5807592 is that the caps falling on the circular plate of the transferring carousel can bounce and subsequently arrange themselves in an undesired position. The possibly bad-positioned caps may prevent the following caps from moving towards the exit area. When this happens, it is necessary to stop the apparatus and to manually remove the caps from the obstruction zone, which implies a loss of productivity.<br>
Another drawback of the apparatus disclosed above is that said apparatus is suitable only for handling caps having a flat surface on a portion of said caps opposite to the hollow<br><br><br>
portion which  engages the bottle neck. In fact the apparatus<br>
according to US 5807592 is so configured that each cap faces<br>
the circular plate of the transferring carousel along the<br>
surface that is opposite to the above mentioned hollow portion.<br>
In order that the cap may rest on the circular plata thereby<br>
achieving a sufficient stable position, the surface that is<br>
opposite to the above mentioned hallow portion must have a flat<br>
geometry- If said surface is not flat, the. cap may swing in<br>
relation-to the circular plate and reach an undesired position.<br>
A further drawback of the apparatus according, to OS 5807592 is<br>
due to its quits complicated structura from the constructional<br>
and  operative point  of view,  since  the  above mentioned<br>
apparatus requires a relatively high number of mechanical<br>
parts, such as for example the star-disc and the guides, which<br>
have to be machined and mounted with great precision in order<br>
to work properly.<br>
These parts are subjected to breakage or deformation, particularly if one or more non properly positioned caps prevent tha following caps from moving towards the exit area, and in the transferring carousel piles of caps are created which escort anomalous stresses on the surrounding mechanical components,<br>
Moreover, the star-disc and the guides constitute bulky parts that make difficult to manually remove the caps from the apparatus when the path towards the exit area is obstructed. Another drawback of the apparatus described above is that it may handle only caps having an axial dimension above a lower limit. If the axial dimension of the caps is smaller than said lower limit, the star-disc acting on the aide surface of the caps may collide with mechanical parts, for example guiding parts, protruding upwards from the circular plate or from the exit area.<br>
US 5776388 discloses an apparatus for forming articles from a starch-based composition- The apparatus comprises a plurality of interconnected heated moulds, such of which, includes a male mould and a female mould. The formed articles are removed from female mould by removing means comprising a rotating drum having a plurality of rotating arms. The rotating arms are attached to vacuum suction cups configured to remove formed articles from female mould and transfer them onto a conveyor belt,<br>
US 586529Z discloses an apparatus for blow molding- bottles, comprising a wheel carrying a plurality of moulds and a picker device for removing the bottles from the respective moulds. The picker device comprises a vacuum conveyor made up of a plenum and a moving plastic chain with attached buckets for receiving the bottles.<br>
CH 294509 discloses an apparatus for manufacturing lipsticks, comprising a first wheel carrying a plurality of moulds in which the lipsticks are formed. A second wheel holds a plurality of supports by means of suction. After each lipstick has been formed, it is transferred onto a corresponding support. To this end, a couple of jaws reach a closed position above the first wheel, thereby defining a conduit for the lipstick. The latter, pushed by an air blast, is removed from the mould and conveyed onto the support. JP 06-271057 discloses a rotary table having a plurality of work positions in a circumferential direction. A box to be printed is put in a work position of the rotary table by a box supply mechanism and is kept adherent to the rotary table by means of suction. The rotary table supplies the box to a pad type printer. After being printed, the box is removed from the rotary table.<br>
US 3798422 discloses a ticket reader which has a rotatable turret and a vacuum system for moving tickets between different stations, one or more of the stations being adapted to provide tickets, one o£ the stations including a reader<br>
for reading- the tickets, and a plurality of the stations being adapted to receive the tickets after they have been read and interpreted.<br>
EP 0218563 discloses an apparatus for transferring pieces of material, particularly lids, between two mutually movable handling means. The apparatus comprises a lid collector provided with a suction-blow mechanism having three arms, which deposits the lid on a suction means on an intermittently rotating first conveyor, The lid is kept on the first conveyor by suction action and is successively moved to a position for leaving the lid to a projection plunge provided on the underside of a second conveyor and having a suction means for holding the lid.<br>
An object of the invention is to improve the apparatuses and the methods for removing objects from forming means in which said objects have been formed.<br>
A further object of the invention is to reduce the risk of obstructing the path directed towards the exit area of a machine for forming objects.<br>
A still further object is to obtain an apparatus and a method allowing objects having a complicated shape to be handled, for example caps having a non-flat surface on a portion of said caps opposite to the hollow portion which engages the bottle neck.<br>
Another object is to simplify the structure of the apparatuses for forming objects, thereby reducing the number of required mechanical parts and consequently improving construction, mounting, maintenance and operation of such apparatuses.<br>
A further object of the invention is to obtain an apparatus which may process also objects having a very small axial dimension, and in particular low caps.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, the present invention there is provided an apparatus comprising forming means for compression molding of objects, moving means arranged for moving said objects along a path extending from said forming means to an exit zone, and further comprising passage means through which an operating fluid is conveyable, characterized in that said passage means passes through a plate portion of said moving wheel means and leads out on said moving wheel means in an intended collecting region of said objects for keeping said objects adherent to said plate portion at least along a present portion of said path.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, the present invention there is also provided a method comprising compression molding objects moving said objects along a path extending to an exit zone by using moving wheel means, characterized in that during said moving said objects are kept adherent to a plate portion of said moving wheel means by an operating fluid conveyed through passage means passing through said plate portion at least along a preset portion of said path.<br>
The operating fluid, acting on the objects at least in a preset portion of the path directed towards the exit area, simplifies the movement of the objects along said path.<br>
In particularly, the operating fluid allows bounces of the objects coming from the forming means to be avoided, thus _<br>
prgventing the objects from reaching an undeslred position on the moving means and causing dangerous obstructions. Thu3, it is pc3giJble to obtain a method and an apparatus having high productivity.<br>
The operating, fluid further enables objects having a complicated shape to be processed,  for • exsaple a .non-flat<br>
5hape-<br>
Finally, owing to the operating fluid it is possible to avoid complex mechanical moving devices, such as tie star-disc or the guides disclosed, in OS 5807SS2. This improves production, operating and maintenance of the appaxatos according the invention.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided Apparatus for moving compression moulded objects along a path comprising forming means for compression moulding of objects, moving wheel means for moving said objects along a path extending from sai'd forming means to an exit zone, said apparatus comprising passage -means passes through a plate portion of said moving wheel means and lead out on said moving wheel means in an intended collecting region of said objects for keeping said objects adherent to said plate portion at least along a preset portion of said path.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided Method for moving compression moulded objects along a path comprising compression moulding objects, moving said objects along a path extending to an exit zone by using moving wheel means, characterized in that during said moving said objects are kept adherent to a plate portion of said moving wheel means by an operating fluid conveyed through passage means passing through said plate portion, at least along a preset portion of said path.<br>
The invention will be better disclossd ana carried out with reference  to  the accompanying drawings,  that  show  some-exemplifying and not limiting embodiments thereof, in which; Figure 1 is a schematic and interrupted front view of an apparatus for producing caps according to the invention; Figure 2 is a top view of moving means of tho apparatus shown in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is an enlarged and interrupted cross-section taken along the plane III- XII of Figure 2;<br>
Figure 4 is a detail of a cross-section as the ona in Figure 3, concerning the production of an alternative version of caps; Figure 5 is a view as the one in Figure 1,     showing an alternative  version  of  the  apparatus  according  to  the invention ;<br>
Figure G is an enlarged and interrupted top view of the apparatus of Figure 5( showing moving means;<br>
Figure 7 is an enlarged and interrupted cross-section along the plane VII-VII of Figure 6.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, an apparatus 1 is shown for producing objects made of plastic material/ for example caps 2 for bottles, by means of compression moulding- the apparatus l comprises forming means 3 provided with a plurality of moulds 4<br><br>
that may rotate about a vertical axis along a circumference Cl, as indicated by the arrow Fl of Figure 2. Each mould 4 comprises a. die 5 provided with a cavity that is shaped according to the external geometry of the cap 2 to be obtained, and a punch .arranged above the die 5 and reproducing the internal geometry of the cap 2.<br>
Along the path of each mould 4 along the circumference Cl, it is possible to identify a mould feeding step in which a preset amount of plastic material in a fluid or semi fluid state is fed in each  die 5, a forming and stabilizing step for forming and stabilizing the cap 2 in the mould 4, and an unloading step in which the just formed cap 2 is extracted from the mould 4. During the forming and stabilizing step, the die 5 and the<br><br>
punch are arranged in a closed configuration in which they mutually cooperate for shaping the plastic material according to the desired geometry of the cap 2. On the contrary, in the mould feeding step and in the unloading step the die 5 and the punch are arranged in an open configuration, -in which they are<br>
at a certain mutual distance so as to allow the plastic<br><br>
material to be introduced into the mould 4 and the just formed<br>
cap 2 to be removed from the mould 4.<br>
In particular, the mould feeding step and the unloading step<br>
occur substantially simultaneously because,  while the just<br>
formed cap 2 is removed from the punch, a dose of plastic<br>
material in a fluid or semi fluid state is fed into the<br>
underlying die 5. This takes place when the mould is in the<br>
first position P indicated in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
At the end of the forming step, the cap 2 is removed from the<br>
punch, for example by exerting an extraction pressure, and<br>
delivered to moving means arranged for moving each cap 2<br>
towards an exit area of the apparatus 1.<br>
The moving means comprises a transferring wheel 6 which may<br>
rotate about a first vertical axis Z, and on which each cap 2<br>
falls from the above punch, under the effect of gravity.<br>
As shown in detail in Figure 3, the transferring wheel 6 comprises a ring 7 , suitable for receiving the end surface of the caps 2 that is opposite to the hollow portion of said caps in which the bottle neck has to be inserted. The ring 7 is fixed to a circular plate 8 that is in turn connected, by means of a lid 9, to the -end of a shaft 10 extending along the first axis Z. The shaft 10 is rotatably supported by bearings 11 and it is rotated by means of a gear 12, which is in turn operated by means of a further gear 13 that is rotated by means of a belt 14, as shown in Figure 1.<br>
At the lower surface of the circular plate 8 a plurality of<br>
cups 15 is fixed. Each cup 15 can comprise, for example, a<br>
member having a U-shaped section taken along a plane<br>
orthogonal to the first axis Z. The cup 15 -can have any other<br>
different shape that is suitable for receiving the plastic<br>
material which will form the caps 2.	<br>
The cups 15 rotate together with the circular plate 8 and define a circular path along which they, interact with an extruder, not shown, provided with an upwards directed mouth from which plastic material in a fluid or semifluid state exits. When a cup 15 passes above the extruder, it takes away, from the latter a prefixed amount of plastic material which, due to its pasty consistency, adheres to the walls of the cup 15. When the cup 15, during its movement along the circular path around the first axis Z, reaches the first position P above an empty die 5, a compressed air blast detaches the plastic  material from the above mentioned cup and causes . the plastic material to fall in the underlying die 5.  The compressed air is sent to each cup by means of a passage 16 obtained in the circular plate 8 and communicating with the external environment by means of a plurality of further passages 17 obtained in an upper portion of the cup 15. First suction means is associated to the transferring wheel 6, said first suction means comprising a plurality of radial<br>
conduits 18 obtained in the thickness of the circular plate 8, and communicating with the external environment by means of respective through . holes 19 vertically extending through the circular plate 8 and the ring 7. On the upper surface of the ring 7, at each through hole 19, a . spot-facing 20 can be provided, said spot-facing being arranged for receiving the end surface of a cap 2 that is opposite to the hollow portion of the same cap.<br>
The radial conduits 18 may be selectively connected to a vacuum pump, not shown, by means of a distributor 22, that is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The distributor 22 has an annular shape and is provided with a slot 23 extending along the distributor 22 for an angular extension that is slightly greater than 90°. The<br>
distributor 22 is fixed to the lower surface of an annular<br>
element 24 housed in. a groove 25 obtained in a further annular<br>
element 26. The latter is arranged in a fixed position on the apparatus 1 and supports the external rings of two further bearings 27, on which the lid 9 is mounted. Thus the lid 9, fixed to the shaft 10 by means of a spline 28, may rotate in relation to the annular element 24, to the further annular element 26 and to the distributor 22, thereby dragging in rotation the circular plate 8 and the ring 7.<br>
A pneumatic connector 21, connected to the annular element 24 and to the further annular element 26, enables the distributor 22 to be connected to the vacuum pump.<br>
When the circular plate 8 and the ring 7, which is fixed to said circular plate, rotate about the first axis Z in the direction of the arrow F2 shown in Figure 2, the distributor 22 connects the radial conduits 18 to the vacuum pump along a suction section A, which is hatched in Figure 2 and has an angular length slightly greater than 90°. In particular, each radial conduit 18 is connected to the vacuum pump just before the relative spot-facing 20 reaches the first position P, and it is isolated from this pump near a second position Q in which<br>
the transferring wheel 6 interacts with an evacuation wheel 29 arranged for transporting the caps 2 towards an exit area of the apparatus 1.<br>
When, in the first position P, a cap 2 which has been removed from the relative punch  falls under gravity onto the transferring wheel 6, said cap is kept adherent to the ring 7 near the respective spot-facing 20, owing to the suction acting along the section A.<br>
The cap 2, firmly associated to the ring 7 by means of suction is moved together with the transferring wheel 6 for an angular distance of about 90o, until said cap reaches the second position Q in which it is collected by. the evacuation wheel 29. The latter may rotate about a second axis .Y, parallel to the first axis Z and therefore vertical, in a rotation direction opposite to the rotation direction, of the transferring wheel 6, as indicated by the arrow F3 of Figure 2. The evacuation wheel 29 is arranged at the upper end of a vertical support 34 fixed<br>
to a frame of the apparatus 1. A non-shown shaft extends inside the vertical support 34, said shaft enabling the evacuation<br>
wheel 29 to rotate owing to known driving means. The driving<br><br>
means that actuates the evacuation wheel 29 may also move the<br>
belt 14, by means of which movement is transmitted to the transferring wheel 6.<br>
The evacuation wheel 29 comprises a star-disc 30 provided with a plurality of radial arms 31, each radial arm being provided with a front edge 32 arranged for interacting with a cap 2 in order to remove said cap from the transferring wheel 6 and<br>
direct said cap along an arc-shaped transfer plane 33.       <br>
The evacuation wheel 29 interacts with the transferring wheel 6<br>
near the second position Q, in which the suction section A on the transferring wheel 6 ends. In such position, the cap 2 is merely resting on the ring 7, no additional force maintaining the cap 2 in contact with the above mentioned ring. The corresponding radial arm 31 of the star-disc 30 may therefore<br>
dimensions and/or shapes without requiring size poxes to be replaced. In fact, suction occurring over the spot-facings 20 enables caps 2 having different sizes to . be kept adherent to the transferring wheel 6. This allows the re-equipment time of the apparatus 1 to be reduced, said re-equipment time being necessary for enabling such apparatus to pass from production of caps 2 of a specific dimensional range to production of caps 2 of a further dimensional range.<br>
As shown in detail, in Figure 4, the apparatus according to the indention is suitable for handling objects, for example caps, having a quite complex shape. In the case in point. it is shown a cap 2 having a convex surface 138 delimiting the cap 2 in its end portion that is opposite to the hollow portion suitable for engaging with the bottle neck.<br>
The cap 2 can be easily kept adherent to the transferring wheel 6 by means of the first suction, means, by merely providing the ring 7 with a plurality of Beats 50 having a shape corresponding to the geometry of the cap 2. The seats 50 communicate with the radial conduits 18 through the holes 19 and can be provided with respective spot-facing 20. When the cap. 2 is removed from the punch, said cap falls onto a seat 50 and shapingly engages with said seat, owing to suction exerted through the radial conduits 18, the cap 2 is prevented from leaving the seat 50.<br>
With reference to Figures 5 to 7, an alternative embodiment of the apparatus 1 is shown, said alternative embodiment differing from the embodiment of Figures 1 to 3 for the structure of the evacuation wheel 29. The forming means 3 and the transferring wheel 6 have a structure similar to that previously described. The evacuation wheel 29 according to Figures 5 to 7 comprises a disc 38 fixed to a further lid 39 coupled to a further shaft 40 by means of a further spline 41. The further shaft 40 extends along the second axis Y inside the vertical support 34 and it is operated by known driving means.<br>
Second suction means is associated with the evacuation wheel 29, said second suction means comprising a plurality of further radial conduits 42 obtained in the thickness of the disc 38 and ending at further through holes 43 arranged in exit areas on the. lower surface of the disc. 38. Around each further through hole 43 a further spet-fusing 44 can be -provided, said further spot-facing 44 being obtained on the lower surface of the disc 38.<br>
The further ± radial conduits 42 can be connected to a suction source through a further distributor 45 comprising a body having an annular shape that is positioned under the disc 38. The further distributor 45 is provided with a further through slot 46 extending along an angle of about 120° and is fixed to a support member 47 mounted around the further shaft 40, with interposition of a bushing 48. The support member 47 is further connected to a plate 49 fixed to the vertical support 34. Therefore, when the disc 38 rotates the further distributor 45 remains in a fixed position on the apparatus 1.<br>
Each exit area arranged around the further through hole 43 of the disc 38 communicates with the suction source along a portion of the path around the second axis Y that corresponds to a further suction section A', hatched in Figure 6. More in particular, by means of the further distributor 45 each exit area is connected to the suction source when the evacuation wheel 29 interacts with the transferring wheel 6 in the second position Q, and is isolated from the suction source in a third position R in which the exit area is over the belt conveyor 35.<br>
In operation, in the second position Q each cap 2, initially<br><br>
arranged on the transferring wheel 6, is collected by the<br>
evacuation wheel 29 by means of suction exerted through the further through holes 43. The cap 2, which is no more retained on the transferring wheel 6 by suction because suction ends near the second position Q, adheres to the lower surface of the disc 38 at the end surface of the cap arranged for engaging<br>
with-the bottle neck and is moved together with such disc until it reaches the third position R. In . this position suction through the further conduits 42 ends and the cap  2 stops adhering to the disc 38, thereby falling by gravity on the underlying belt conveyor. 35. <br>
The dise 38 provided with second suction means may replace the star-disc 30, which allows the structure of the evacuation wheel 29 to be significantly simplified. In fact, it is no more necessary to provide a plurality of radial arms having large overall dimensions and causing a complicated access to the evacuation wheel 29. Furthermore, pneumatically transporting the caps 2 enables the risks of damaging" the caps 2 during transport to be reduced. On the other hand, such risks are quite high in case of transport by means of mechanical elements pushing the caps 2 along the desired path.<br>
Owing to the second suction means, the evacuation wheel 29 further allows caps 2 having different dimensions and/or shape<br>
to be transported, without replacing size parts.<br>
Furthermore the evacuation wheel 29 is suitable for processing caps 2 having also irregular shapes, in particular caps delimited by a non-flat . surface on the portion of said caps opposite to the hollow portion arranged for engaging with the bottle neck.<br>
Owing to the second suction means the apparatus 1 may furthermore handle very low caps, i.e. . caps having a particularly small axial dimension that cannot be processed by the known star-discs. In fact, the evacuating wheel 29 associated with the second suction means is not provided with mechanical parts which, while acting on the side surface of the caps 2, could bump against other parts of the apparatus. The second suction means allows the evacuating wheel 29 to act only on the hollow portion of the caps 2, thereby preventing any collision against adjacent parts. It is to be noted that the evacuation wheel 29 provided with<br>
the second suction means can be used also in combination with a transferring wheel 6 of the known type, i.e. without first suction means. The apparatus 1 disclosed above can be used not only for<br>
processing caps 2, but also for processing other kinds, of objects, for example cups, items provided with an axial symmetry, or in general articles that can be obtained by molding.<br><br><br><br><br>
