Description<br>
Method and automation system for monitoring at least one<br>
installation component in a technical installation<br>
Today, technical installations are normally monitored and/or<br>
controlled using what are known as automation systems. By way<br>
of example, a technical installation may be an installation for<br>
carrying out a process-engineering process or an industrial<br>
production process or else may be an installation for<br>
generating or distributing electrical power. Such technical<br>
installations usually have various installation components<br>
whose correct interaction ensures that the technical<br>
installation operates in the desired fashion. To be able to<br>
control and/or monitor the technical installation, automation<br>
systems are provided which use sensors to capture the state of<br>
the individual components in a technical installation and<br>
usually transfer it to a superordinate control center. From<br>
there, regulatory and control action can be taken on the<br>
technical installation by sending commands to actuators in the<br>
automation system, which then act directly on the technical<br>
installation.<br>
It is known practice for the sensors used in the automation<br>
system also to be image capture equipment. Thus, by way of<br>
example, German laid-open specification DE 44 02 779 A1<br>
discloses an observation system with a video camera in which<br>
image data recorded by means of a video camera are digitized<br>
and are transferred to a particular, previously stipulated<br>
control centre.<br><br>
In addition, US patent specification US 5,805,813 discloses a<br>
method for monitoring installation components in a technical<br>
installation in the form of a substation in a power<br>
distribution network, in which a camera is used to capture<br>
visual displays, for example, from measuring and monitoring<br>
equipment on an installation component. The image data captured<br>
in this manner are then evaluated by means of a computer system<br>
such that automatic image recognition is used to recognize the<br>
position of the respective measuring equipment and to compare<br>
it with appropriate prescribed threshold values. If a threshold<br>
value is exceeded then an alarm signal is generated and is<br>
transferred to a particular control room, for example.<br>
However, image recognition as used in the method described is<br>
relatively involved and can be achieved only with a high level<br>
of computer power. In addition, the operating personnel at the<br>
control centre has no way of checking the correctness of the<br>
results of the image recognition.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method and<br>
an automation system for monitoring at least one installation<br>
component in a technical installation in which image data from<br>
the installation components can be accessed comparatively<br>
flexibly.<br>
The invention achieves this object by means of a method for<br>
monitoring at least one installation component in a technical<br>
installation using an automation system which controls and/or<br>
monitors the technical installation, in which at least one<br>
image capture device generates image data from the at least one<br>
installation component, the captured image data are transferred<br>
to<br><br>
a server data processing device and are stored there, the<br>
stored image data are transmitted to a client data processing<br>
device, and the transmitted image data are displayed as an<br>
image by means of a display apparatus on the client data<br>
processing device. The fundamental advantage of the inventive<br>
solution is that a client data processing device can be used to<br>
access the captured image data from the installation component<br>
from almost any desired location. A fixed association with a<br>
control center to which the image data are transferred is no<br>
longer necessary. The reason for this is that the captured<br>
image data are first of all stored on a server data processing<br>
device, which is usually arranged in the vicinity of the image<br>
capture device, and are held there for retrieval by the client<br>
data processing device. The client data processing device may<br>
be connected to the server data processing device by means of<br>
an arbitrary communication link, but particularly by means of a<br>
communication network. By way of example, such a network may be<br>
either what is known as a "Local Area Network" (LAN) , a "Wide<br>
Area Network" (WAN) or else an intranet or the internet. This<br>
means that the server data processing device can be accessed<br>
from almost any site, that is to say flexibly. The data<br>
transfer can take place by wire or wirelessly, for example by<br>
radio or by infrared radiation.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the inventive method, the<br>
image data stored on the server data processing device are<br>
retrieved by virtue of the client data processing device<br>
sending an electronic request to the server data processing<br>
device, and the image data stored on the<br><br>
server data processing device are transferred to the client<br>
data processing device in response to the electronic request.<br>
In this way, the requisite image data are not transferred<br>
continuously but rather only upon retrieval by the client<br>
processing device. This allows the transferred volume of data<br>
and hence the loading of the communication link by the transfer<br>
of the image data to be kept relatively small, since the image<br>
data are transferred only upon special request by the client<br>
data processing device.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the inventive method,<br>
the image capture device captures the image data as frames at<br>
prescribed intervals of time. Such an image capture device may<br>
be a comparatively inexpensive digital camera, also called a<br>
"webcam". . The webcam delivers respective frames at settable<br>
intervals of time and transfers them, for example in JPEG<br>
format, to the server data processing device.<br>
Alternatively, the image capture device can also capture the<br>
image data as continuous images. In this way, continuous images<br>
can be captured particularly advantageously using a video<br>
camera, for example. In the case of this alternative, the<br>
volume of image data transferred to the server data processing<br>
device is naturally greater than in the case of frame capture.<br>
Furthermore, in another advantageous embodiment of the<br>
inventive method, the client data processing device displays a<br>
schematic representation of the technical installation, with<br>
individual installation components<br><br>
having respective associated component representations in the<br>
displayed schematic representation, and with the respective<br>
component representations having selectable links, and<br>
selection of a link is followed by the image data from that<br>
installation component which is associated with the relevant<br>
component representation being transferred to the client data<br>
processing device. In this way, when there are a plurality of<br>
installation components monitored by means of image capture<br>
devices, the volume of image data transferred from the server<br>
data processing device to the client data processing device can<br>
be reduced because only the image data associated with a<br>
selected installation component are transferred. It is<br>
therefore not necessary for the image data from all<br>
installation components to be constantly sent to the client<br>
data processing device, but rather only the image data from the<br>
selected installation component.<br>
In addition, in another advantageous embodiment of the<br>
inventive method, an alteration to a state of an installation<br>
component automatically prompts the image data associated with<br>
this installation component to be transferred to the client<br>
data processing device and to be displayed there as an image.<br>
In this way, when there is a fault in an installation<br>
component, for example, the relevant image data can be<br>
automatically transferred to the client data processing device<br>
for display. This allows the operating personnel on the client<br>
data processing device to be informed very quickly.<br>
In this connection, there may also be provision that, when a<br>
Request-Respond communication protocol, particularly the HTTP<br>
protocol, is used, an alteration to a<br><br>
state of an installation component prompts the image data<br>
associated with this installation component to be stored on the<br>
server data processing device first of all, and these stored<br>
data are automatically transferred to the client data<br>
processing device when image data are next retrieved by the<br>
client data processing device. Since what are known as "Request<br>
Respond" communication protocols allow data to be transferred<br>
from the server data processing device to the client data<br>
processing device only upon request by the client data<br>
processing device, in this case the generated image data are<br>
first of all buffer-stored on the server data processing device<br>
and are transferred to the client data processing device upon<br>
the next request. The client data processing device can<br>
retrieve image data from the server data processing device at<br>
prescribed regular or else irregular intervals of time, for<br>
example, so as always to have the most up-to-date stock of data<br>
possible.<br>
The aforementioned object is also achieved by an automation<br>
system for monitoring and/or controlling a technical<br>
installation, having an image capture device for generating<br>
image data from at least one installation component in the<br>
technical installation, where the automation system has a<br>
server data processing device on which the generated image data<br>
are stored, and a client data processing device which is used<br>
to retrieve the image data stored on the server data processing<br>
device for the purpose of display on the client data processing<br>
device. In such an automation system, the server-client<br>
architecture of the system allows the server data processing<br>
device to be accessed from almost any location.<br><br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the inventive automation<br>
system, the image capture device is designed for frame capture.<br>
Alternatively, provision may also be made for the image capture<br>
device to be designed for capturing continuous images.<br>
To explain the invention further, the drawing shows an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a method and of an automation system<br>
for monitoring at least one installation component in a<br>
technical installation, where<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of an automation<br>
system for monitoring installation components in a<br>
power distribution installation, and<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of a screen display<br>
shown on a client data processing device in the<br>
automation system.<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a technical installation in the<br>
form of a power distribution installation, for example for a<br>
switchpanel, of which only a transformer 1 is shown by way of<br>
representation in figure 1. Apart from the transformer 1 shown,<br>
said switchpanel may also contain circuit breakers, control and<br>
protection equipment, capacitors and other installation<br>
components, for example, which are not shown here for reasons<br>
of clarity, however. The switchpanel also has image capture<br>
devices, for example in the form of cameras, arranged on it, of<br>
which the image capture devices 2a to 2d are shown here by way<br>
of example. As is intended to be indicated by the dashed<br><br>
lines, the switchpanel may not hold just the four image capture<br>
devices shown, but rather any number thereof. The image capture<br>
device 2a is trained on the transformer 1, while the other<br>
image capture devices 2b to 2d may be trained on other<br>
installation components, not shown in the figure.<br>
The image capture devices 2a to 2d are connected to a server<br>
data processing device 4 by means of data lines 3. Instead of<br>
wired data lines 3, the image capture devices 2a to 2d can also<br>
communicate with the server data processing device 4 by means<br>
of wireless communication links. The server data processing<br>
device 4 is connected to a network 5, for example an intranet<br>
or the internet. The network 5 can be accessed using client<br>
data processing devices 6a and 6b, of which a laptop and a<br>
desktop PC are shown here by way of example. The client data<br>
processing devices 6a an 6b may be connected to the network by<br>
means of wired or wireless communication links. Apart from the<br>
client data processing devices 6a and 6b shown, other<br>
equipment, for example what are known as PDAs ("Personal<br>
Digital Assistants") or mobile telephones, which is accordingly<br>
set up as a client data processing device may also be used. In<br>
this case, it is also possible for the client data processing<br>
devices used to be parts of a central control room.<br>
The image capture devices 2a to 2d, the server data processing<br>
device 4, the network 5 and the client data processing devices<br>
6a and 6b are parts of an automation system which, besides the<br><br>
parts shown in figure 1, may also have other components, such<br>
as further sensors and measuring equipment, control and<br>
protection equipment and also actuators for performing control<br>
and regulation actions in the switchpanel. The automation<br>
system can, in principle, be used to take control and<br>
monitoring action on the technical installation; the visual<br>
monitoring of the installation components using the image<br>
capture devices 2a to 2d is just one subfunction of the<br>
automation system. Normally, such an automation system will be<br>
controlled by means of a special piece of automation software.<br>
The text below will describe the method for monitoring the<br>
installation components of the switchpanel, which is carried<br>
out using the parts of the automation system which are shown in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
The image capture device 2a records an image of the transformer<br>
1 and transfers it in the form of image data to the server data<br>
processing device 4 by means of the data line 3. The server<br>
data processing device 4 stores these image data. If required,<br>
the image data can also be stored on the server data processing<br>
device 4 in compressed form in order to save storage space on<br>
the server data processing device. This can be done using known<br>
image data compression formats, such as JPEG.<br>
Similarly, the other image capture devices 2b to 2d which are<br>
present in the switchpanel are used to record images of other<br>
installation components in the switchpanel, and corresponding<br>
image data are transferred to the server data processing device<br>
4 and are stored there.<br><br>
The image data stored on the server data processing device 4<br>
can now be transferred to the client data processing devices 6a<br>
and 6b via the communication network 5. The client data<br>
processing devices 6a and 6b can now be used to convert the<br>
image data into appropriate image displays and to display them<br>
on display devices, usually monitors. Figure 1 therefore shows<br>
an image of the transformer 1 monitored by the image capture<br>
device 2a, generated from the transferred image data, purely in<br>
eye-catching form on the monitors of the client data processing<br>
devices 6a and 6b.<br>
By way of example, the image capture devices 2a and 2d may be<br>
image capture devices for capturing frames at defined intervals<br>
of time. By way of example, image data from the relevant<br>
installation components may thus be recorded every 10 seconds<br>
and stored on the server data processing device 4. In that<br>
case, the client data processing devices 6a and 6b show a<br>
discontinuous image display which is updated every 10 seconds,<br>
for example.<br>
Alternatively, the image capture devices 2a to 2d may also<br>
continuously capture image data from the installation<br>
components, so that what is happening on the switchpanel,<br>
"life" so to speak, can thus be observed continuously on the<br>
client data processing devices 6a and 6b.<br>
In both cases, provision may be made for older image data on<br>
the server data processing device 4 to be<br><br>
deleted again after a certain time in order to create storage<br>
space for freshly recorded image data.<br>
The image monitoring of the technical installation allows the<br>
operating personnel to observe what is happening on the<br>
switchpanel very conveniently on the client data processing<br>
devices 6a and 6b and to recognize certain fault situations<br>
quickly, for example. It is therefore possible for mechanical<br>
damage to the transformer 1 to be recognized quickly using the<br>
image of the transformer displayed on the client data<br>
processing devices 6a and 6b, for example.<br>
Normally, however, it will not be necessary to transfer all the<br>
image data stored on the server data processing device 4 to the<br>
client data processing devices 6a and 6b constantly. By way of<br>
example, provision may. be made for a client data processing<br>
device to use an electronic request sent to the server data<br>
processing device 4 via the network 5 to request the stored<br>
image data and for the stored image data to be transferred from<br>
the server data processing device 4 to the relevant client data<br>
processing device in response to this request. In addition,<br>
provision may also be made for the electronic request to be<br>
used to transfer only the image data from a selected<br>
installation component or from a few selected installation<br>
components from the server data processing device 4 to the<br>
relevant client data processing device.<br>
To this end, by way of example, the display devices on the<br>
client data processing devices 6a and 6b can be used to show a<br>
schematic representation - for example a block diagram - of the<br>
technical installation. In this context, the schematic<br><br>
representation comprises individual component representations<br>
(e.g. symbols for switches, transformers, etc.), these<br>
component representations being associated with respective<br>
corresponding real installation components in the technical<br>
installation. By selecting one of the component representations<br>
displayed, for example by means of a mouse click on the client<br>
data processing device, it is possible to activate a link which<br>
prompts the server data processing device 4 to transfer<br>
precisely the image data corresponding to the selected<br>
component representation to the respective client data<br>
processing device.<br>
This is explained in more detail in figure 2 . This is because<br>
figure 2 shows a possible view of a screen representation of<br>
the automation software by way of example. Normally, the<br>
automation software will be installed on the server data<br>
processing device and will be executed there, so that the<br>
client data processing device mainly needs to have a web<br>
browser installed on it which is used to access the automation<br>
software. However, it is also conceivable for the automation<br>
software to be installed on the client data processing device<br>
itself and to be executed thereon. In this case, no web browser<br>
is required. In the example which follows, however, the former<br>
case will be assumed.<br>
In figure 2, it is possible to see a browser window 11, which<br>
may be a window in Microsoft Internet Explorer™ or a window in<br>
Netscape Navigator™, for example. A browser is an interface<br>
which a user of a client data processing device can use to<br>
access a server data processing device.<br><br>
The browser window 11 also has a plurality of individual<br>
windows, for example a settings window 12 "Settings", a tools<br>
window 13 "Tools" and a control window 14 "Control". For the<br>
sake of simplicity, the settings and tools windows 12 and 13<br>
are shown empty in figure 2. This is where it is possible to<br>
provide settings options and tools options for controlling the<br>
automation software, for example. The control window 14 can be<br>
used to select various parts of a technical installation, which<br>
is monitored using the automation system, from a structured<br>
tree representation, as is also known from Microsoft Windows<br>
Explorer™, for example.<br>
By way of example, a specific technical installation<br>
(substation 3) associated with a superordinate installation<br>
(station 1) is selected in the control window 14. In turn, a<br>
specific section (unit 2) of the specific technical<br>
installation (substation 3) has been selected and is marked by<br>
means of a frame in the control window 14.<br>
This section (unit 2) of the technical installation is shown in<br>
detail in an overview window 15. In a schematic representation<br>
of what is known as a "single line diagram", it is possible to<br>
see two busbars which are connected to one another by means of<br>
transformers and circuit breakers arranged on the outgoing<br>
connections of the transformers. In the single line diagram,<br>
the installation components in the relevant section of the<br>
technical installation are shown using component<br>
representations, for example the transformers are shown in the<br>
form of transformer symbols 16, while the component<br>
representation for circuit breakers is displayed in the form of<br>
switch symbols 17 in the overview window 15.<br><br>
Normally, states of the individual installation components can<br>
be displayed in such an overview window, e.g. the position of a<br>
circuit breaker can be shown. In addition, it is also possible<br>
to perform control actions directly in the overview window, for<br>
example in order to open or close a circuit breaker.<br>
Furthermore, visual monitoring of the installation components<br>
using the described method is possible. To this end, the<br>
component representations have associated links such that when<br>
the component representations are selected, for example by<br>
clicking with a mouse, a corresponding electronic request is<br>
generated which is sent from the respective client data<br>
processing device to the server data processing device 4 via<br>
the network 5. This electronic request prompts the server data<br>
processing device 4 to transmit the image data from the<br>
installation components associated with the selected component<br>
representation to the requesting client data processing device.<br>
In the case in figure 2, the component representation 17 of a<br>
circuit breaker (Circuit Breaker 3) has been selected, which<br>
uses an electronic request to prompt the server data processing<br>
device 4 to transmit the image data from the relevant circuit<br>
breaker to the client data processing device. The transmitted<br>
image data are displayed as an image in an image window 18. In<br>
the image window 18, it is therefore possible to see three<br>
switch poles of the circuit breaker associated with the<br>
component representations 17.<br>
By clicking on other component representations, it is similarly<br>
possible to retrieve the respective relevant image data from<br>
the server data processing device. In this way, all the image<br>
data are not constantly displayed as images on the client data<br>
processing device.<br><br>
In addition, the automation system shown in figure 1 may have<br>
provision for an alteration to an installation component to<br>
prompt the relevant image data to be automatically sent from<br>
the server data processing device 4 to the client data<br>
processing devices 6a and 6b and to be shown there. By way of<br>
example, such an alteration to an installation component can be<br>
made using image recognition which automatically recognizes<br>
alterations to the installation component in question. By way<br>
of example, this allows mechanical deformations in monitored<br>
installation components to be recognized. An image of the<br>
relevant installation component can then be automatically<br>
displayed to the operating personnel on the client data<br>
processing devices 6a, 6b, possibly in conjunction with an<br>
appropriate warning report.<br>
Alternatively, the automation system can also recognize, by way<br>
of example, that a control action has been initiated on a<br>
particular installation component or that an installation<br>
component has a fault. By way of example, this can be<br>
recognized from currents in relevant installation components,<br>
detected by the automation system using current transformers.<br>
The relevant image data from the relevant installation<br>
component are then automatically retrieved from the server data<br>
processing device 4 and transferred to the client data<br>
processing devices 6a and 6b.<br>
When a "Request-Respond" communication protocol, for example<br>
the HTTP internet protocol, is used, the image data<br>
automatically captured from the relevant installation component<br>
are first of all stored on the server data processing device 4<br>
and are transferred to the client data processing devices 6a<br>
and 6b when they next retrieve them.<br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1. A method for monitoring at least one installation component in a<br>
technical installation using an automation system which controls<br>
and/or monitors the technical installation, in which<br>
at least one image capture device generates image data from the at<br>
least one installation component;<br>
the captured image data are transferred to a server data processing<br>
device and are stored there;<br>
the stored image data are transmitted to a client data processing<br>
device having a display device;<br>
characterized in that<br>
the client data processing device displays a schematic representation,<br>
with individual installation components having respective associated<br>
component representations in the displayed schematic representation,<br>
and with the respective component representations having selectable<br>
links, and in that<br>
selection of a link is followed by the image data from that installation<br>
component which is associated with the relevant component<br>
representation being transferred to the client data processing device.<br><br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein :<br>
the image data stored on the server data processing device are<br>
retrieved by virtue of the client data processing device sending an<br>
electronic request to the server data processing device, and wherein<br>
the image data stored on the server data processing device are<br>
transferred to the client data processing device in response to the<br>
electronic request.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the image capture<br>
device captures the image data as frames at prescribed intervals of<br>
time.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2.<br>
wherein the image capture device captures the image data as<br>
continuous images.<br>
5.	The method as claimed one of the preceding claims, wherein an<br>
alternation to a state of an installation component automatically<br>
prompts the image data associated with this installation component to<br>
be transferred to the client data processing device and to be displayed<br>
there as an image.<br><br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein when a Request-Respond<br>
communication protocol, particularly the HTTP protocol, is used, an<br>
alteration to a state of an installation component prompts the image<br>
data associated with this installation component to be stored on the<br>
server data processing device first of all, and wherein the stored data<br>
are automatically transferred to the client data processing device when<br>
image data are next retrieved by the client data processing device.<br>
7.	An automation system for monitoring and/or controlling a technical<br>
installation, comprising :<br>
an image capture device for generating image data from at least one<br>
installation component in the technical installation, the automation<br>
system having a server data processing device on which the<br>
generated image data are stored; and<br>
a client data processing device having a display device, wherein<br>
the client data processing device displays a schematic representation,<br>
with individual installation components having respective associated<br>
component representations in the displayed schematic representation,<br>
and with the respective component representations having selectable<br>
links, and in that<br><br>
selection of a link is followed by the image data from that installation<br>
component which is associated with the relevant component<br>
representation being transferred to the client data processing device.<br>
8.	The automation system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the image<br>
capture device is configured for frame capture.<br>
9.	The automation system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the image<br>
capture device is configured for capturing continuous images.<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring at least one installation<br>
component in a technical installation using an automation system which controls<br>
and/or monitors the technical installation, in which at least one image capture<br>
device generates image data from the at least one installation component; the<br>
captured image data are transferred to a server data processing device and are<br>
stored there; the stored image data are transmitted to a client data processing<br>
device having a display device; the client data processing device displays a<br>
schematic representation, with individual installation components having<br>
respective associated component representations in the displayed schematic<br>
representation, and with the respective component representations having<br>
selectable links, and in that selection of a link is followed by the image data from<br>
that installation component which is associated with the relevant component<br>
representation being transferred to the client data processing device.<br></td>
