This invention relates to a tea stall mounted on a vehicle.<br>
This invention proposes a tea stall which can be moved about from location to location for doing business especially by small merchants, unemployed persons and the like who may not have the resources to rent or own shops in buildings.<br>
The tea stall proposed herein has provision for carrying all necessary utensils for dispensing tea and other beverages (hot or cold) and for supplying solid food, such as, packed lunches and snacks. The expression "tea" in this specification includes other beverages (hot or cold) as well, such, as coffee, milk, and soft drinks.<br>
The said invention ensures that the vehicle can be parked stably while<br>
doing business and that business can be transacted easily and effortlessly.<br>
or own sin.'ti:, u- i   ■,<br>
The tea stall can be demounted from the vehicle whenever the former is not in use and taken away for storage, servicing and maintenance of the vehicle from time to time.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description given hereunder.<br>
The tea stall mounted on a vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a box mounted on the vehicle behind the rider's seat, the box being provided with a lid, the lid being extensible to provide a table top; a wheeled stand provided for the box, said stand being detachably fixed to the box; a canopy structure with canopy for being raised and lowered<br><br>
over the box; a hood within the box for being seated on the rear wheel of the vehicle; a collapsible umbrella attached to the box.<br>
The tea stall mounted on a vehicle will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the invention proposed herein.<br>
The box is mounted on the vehicle behind rider's seat (Figure 1). The box 01 has a lid 02. Two stays 03 are provided in the box with pivots 04 and registers 05 (Figure 4). There is a hood 06 in the box which sits on the rear wheel on assembly (Figure 1). The shape of the hood allows the accessory to be mounted around the rear wheel (top of the wheel as well as sides will have useful volume for loading). The box has guides 07 for stand 08. The box also has guides 17 for canopy 09. It has a mounting bracket 10 for umbrella (Figure 5).<br>
The box has registers 11 for holding flasks. Also it has holes 12 for mounting attachments(Figure 3).<br>
The embodiment has a stand 08 with four legs 13 (Figure 1). Each leg has a wheel 14. The four legs are connected by three tubular members 15.<br>
Four pins 25 are provided on the box for locking the stand in extended condition during parking as well as in the closed condition during movement of the vehicle.<br><br>
Also the embodiment has a canopy 09 (Figure 2) which has canopy structure 18 and two telescopic columns 19. It has two screws 20. The canopy is covered by flexible vinyl sheet 21.<br>
Brackets 22 are provided on top of the box. Lock 23 is provided in the lid 02. Hooks 24 and fixing cross pins 25 are provided at the bottom of the box 01.<br>
The embodiment is mounted on two wheeled motor vehicles and also bicycles (Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10). Three or four wheeled motor vehicles including those for the handicapped can be utilized for the purpose. Two, three or four wheeled manually powered vehicles can also be used.<br>
The embodiment is mounted on to a two wheeled vehicle. The assembly of the embodiment while the vehicle is in motion is shown in Figure 7.<br>
The embodiment functions as a compact mobile kiosk. The items for sale are kept on top of the box 01 and held securely to prevent falling off<br>
The flasks for dispensing tea are securely held in recesses 11. A wire basket 26 is secured on to the top of box 01 using brackets 22 and fasteners. Snacks and bottles containing snacks are kept in the wire basket for display and easy accessibility. Cups, plates, saleable items are stowed in the box by opening the lid provided at rear of the box. These items are kept under lock 23 which is fixed to the lid 02.<br>
For doing business, the vendor stops the vehicle and puts the vehicle on stand 08. The stand 08 is dropped from the box 01 after releasing from<br><br>
the hooks 24 provided on left and right side of the vehicle. The stand 08 is. held in dropped condition by fixing cross pins 25, All the four legs 13 drop simultaneously as they are connected by three tubular members 15. Also the stand 08 is stowed partially in the box by lifting up and engaging cross pins 25. The stand 08 will be in lifted condition while the vehicle is motion.<br>
The canopy structure 18 is in closed condition sitting on the top of the box. For doing business it will be moved up using the two telescopic columns 19. The canopy is kept at extended position using two screws 20 and two cross pins 16. To lower the canopy on to the box, the screws and cross pins are removed and the telescopic column is pushed in to the box. The canopy seves to protect the box from the sun. A collapsible umbrella fixed to the box provides shade as well as protection from sun and rain.<br>
When doing business, the vendor extends the top area which fiinctions as table top by opening the lid and rotating it to horizontal condition to match the top surface of the box. It is kept in that condition by using two stays 03 and two registers 05.<br>
The sides of the box and canopy provide space for exhibiting commercial<br>
Cl 0':J&gt; jJiii ,  .ii C  ....... .	 .     -<br>
brands and slogans.<br>
The vendor fills the cans with tea. He loads the cans and snacks on to the box, carries to different places and parks the vehicle where there are potential customers. He conducts his business and moves to new locations or home after selling his tea and snacks.<br>
(■"'"'■Hi'  ::.<br><br>
Currently the mobile vending business is done using head loads, push carts and cycles. This method of doing business does not create good ambience and convenience to customers and vendors. This does not provide an aesthetic feel to the customers in visual and hygienic sense. Also, this manner of merchandising does not provide means to communicate brands of the tea or identity of seller.<br>
This invention provides a mobile kiosk for moving around and reaching customers wherever they are. Instead of customers usually coming to a stall for refreshments, the stall comes to the customer.This provides an elegant solution where the seller need not invest and incur costs involved in renting a shop.<br>
The embodiment is compact enough for doing business on the vehicle or off the vehicle by using the stand.<br>
The embodiment has it's own brand identity and cannot be mistaken for some other device or equipment. This will provide very good recognition for the vendor who is operating in the field and for the corporate entity which is manufacturing and distributing tea leaves.<br>
As the embodiment is on the move, it is a good bill board for the corporate sphere.<br>
The food grade stainless steel material used for the top of box and lid provides hygienic surfaces for food and drinks. A wire basket is secured on to the top of the box for snacks and bottles for display and easy accessibility.<br><br>
The embodiment can be easily operated, used and maintained by the<br>
seller.<br>
The canopy can be raised and lowered with minimum effort on telescopic<br>
columns. Also the stand can be lowered or stowed away easily. When the<br>
vehicle is stationary, the design of stand provides very good stability.<br>
Also the vehicle can be moved for a short distance with the stand on<br>
using the wheels attached to the stand.<br>
The seller can avail vehicle loan schemes/ micro loans with low monthly<br>
payments as the equipment is mounted on vehicle. This will provide<br>
!'he einhotiiiricsi',  . )^ • ,	■ .■   ■<br>
means for earning to the unemployed.<br>
^!.:■!iC!■<br>
It will be appreciated that this invention is not confined to the embodiment described and illustrated, by way of example, but that various other embodiments are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
