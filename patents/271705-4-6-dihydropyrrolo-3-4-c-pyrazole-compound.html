				<td>CARBONYLAMINO PYRROLOPYRAZOLES. POTENT KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/753,349 filed December 21, 2005 and 60/864,932 filed November 8,2006, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to novel chemical compounds and methods. More particularly, the invention provides novel carbonylamino pyrrolopyrazole compounds and their analogs, having protein kinase activity, and methods of synthesizing and using such compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of specific tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues in proteins. Typically, such phosphorylation can dramatically change the function of the protein and thus protein kinases can be pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival. The mechanism of these cellular processes provides a basis for targeting protein kinases to treat disease conditions resulting from or involving disorder of these cellular processes. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, cancer and diabetes.<br>
Protein kinases can be broken into two types, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). Both PTKs and STKs can be receptor protein kinases or non-receptor protein kinases. PAK is a family of non-receptor STKs. The p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases plays important roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphogenesis (Daniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999); Sells et al., Trends Cell. Biol. 7:162-167 (1997)). PAK proteins were initially identified by their interaction with the active small GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac, and their homology, to yeast kinase Ste20 (Manser et al., Nature 367: 40-46 (1994)). In addition to mediating the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion by Cdc42 and Rac (Daniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999)), it was determined that some PAK proteins protect cells from apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276: 14414-14419 (2001); Rudel et al., Science 276:1571-1574 (1997); Schurmann et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 20: 453-461 (2000)); modulate mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (Bagrodia et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 27995-27998 (1995); Brown et al., Curr. Biol. 6: 598-605 (1996); Chaudhary et al., Curr. Biol. 10: 551-554 (2000); Frost et al., EMBO J. 16: 6426-6438 (1997); King et al., Nature 396: 180-183 (1998); Sun et al., Curr. Biol. 10: 281-284 (2000)); mediate T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling (Yablonski et<br>
al., EMBO J. 17: 5647-5657 (1998)); and respond to DNA damage (Roig et al., J. Biol. Chem. 27'4: 31119-31122 (1999)). Through these diverse functions, PAK proteins regulate cell proliferation and migration.<br>
The full-length PAK4 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,013,500 and have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AF005046 (mRNA) and AAD01210 (amino acid). Modulation of human PAK4 activity is reported to result in alterations in cellular processes affecting cell growth and adhesion. For example, overexpression of PAK4 in fibroblasts leads to morphological changes that are characteristic of oncogenic transformation through induction of anchorage-independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:14414-14419 (2001); Qu et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 21: 3523-2533 (2001)). More recently, it was also shown that: PAK4 is frequently overexpressed in human tumor cell lines of various tissue origins; expression of an active PAK4 mutant has transforming potential, leading to anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cell line; and a kinase-inactive PAK4 efficiently blocks transformation by activated Ras and inhibits anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. These data strongly implicate PAK4 in oncogenic transformation and suggest that PAK4 activation is required for Ras-driven, anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cells. (Smeal, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 277, 550-558 (2002)) In vivo efficacy in mice with implanted tumor of a compound that inhibits the PAK4 kinase domain is shown in the current application.<br>
PAK4 therefore appears to us to be an attractive target for developing therapeutic agents effective for treating disorders involving abnormal cell growth, especially cancer.<br>

Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification and claims have the meanings discussed below. Variables defined in this section, such as R, X, n and the like, are for reference within this section only, and are not meant to have the save meaning as may be used outside of this definitions section. Further, many of the groups defined herein can be optionally substituted. The listing in this definitions section of typical substituents is exemplary and is not intended to limit the substituents defined elsewhere within this specification and claims.<br>
As used herein, the symbol [	] when incorporated into the chemical<br>
structure of a substituent means that the atom to which [	] is attached is the point of<br>
attachment of that substitutent to some position on another molecule.  For example, X in<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
the hypothetical molecule CH3CHrX might be defined as X isIn which case,<br>
the placement of [	] attached to the arbitrarily numbered position C-1, means that<br>
C-1 of the phenyl ring is attached to the methylene carbon.<br>
The symbols  and  when used together in a single molecule without further indication otherwise, for example, chemical name or accompanying description, merely indicate relative stereochemistry of trans or cis where applicable.   The symbol<br>
and the symbol used together or separately, in combination with an indication of them representing the absolute stereochemistry, for example, an indication of "S" or "R in the corresponding chemical structure or the accompanying chemical name, indicate the absolute stereochemistry of the corresponding chiral center.<br>
When a diradical is referred as, for example, -O-CH2- or -(C1-C3 alkylene)-NH-, it is understood that each end of the diradical can equally connect to another moiety.  For<br>
example, if K is defined as A-L-B, and L is a diradical selected from -O-CH2- and -(C1-C3 alkylene)-, it is understood that K is therefore selected from A-O-CH2-B, A-CH2-O-B, and A-(C1-C3 alkylene)-B. A and B herein refer to different organic moieties.<br>

For example, "heterocyclyl group optionally substituted with an alkyl group" means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the heterocyclyl group<br>
is substituted with an alkyl group and situations where the heterocyclyl group is not substituted with the alkyl group.<br>
When a group is "optionally substituted" or "optionally further substituted" by some substituents, it means the hydrogen atoms of this group, except when the group itself is a hydrogen, where permissible, is substituted by some substituents. For example, such definition of a group "R is H, C1-C3 alkyl and phenyl, and R Is optionally further substituted by 1-3 groups selected from -F, oxo and C1-C3 perfluoroalkyl'', it is intended that R is 1) H (when R is H, R cannot be further substituted); 2) C1-C3 alkyl optionally further substituted by 1-3 groups selected from -F, oxo and C1-C3 perfluoroalkyl; and 3) phenyl optionally further substituted by 1-3 groups selected from -F and C1-C3 perfluoroalkyl. Optional substitution of oxo does not apply when R is phenyl because no single atom of the phenyl group possess two hydrogen atoms to be substituted by oxo, i.e. =0 bond.<br>
A "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a mixture of one or more of the compounds described herein, or physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components, such as physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.<br>

Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the parent compound. Such salts include:<br>
(1)	acid addition salts, which can be obtained by reaction of the free base of the parent compound with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid and the like, or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, (D) or (L) malic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid and the like; or<br>

or   coordinates   with   an   organic   base   such   as   ethanolamine,   diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like.<br>
"PK" refers to receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RTKs), non-receptor or "cellular" tyrosine kinase (CTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs).<br>
"Modulation" or "modulating" refers to the alteration of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs. In particular, modulating refers to the activation of the catalytic activity of RTKs,, CTKs and STKs, preferably the activation or inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, depending on the concentration of the compound or salt to which the RTK, CTK or STK is exposed or, more preferably, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.<br>
"Catalytic activity" refers to the rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine under the influence, direct or indirect, of RTKs and/or CTKs or the phosphorylation of serine and threonine under the influence, direct or indirect, of STKs.<br>
"Contacting" refers to bringing a compound of the present teachings and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PK, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such "contacting" can be accomplished "in vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PK of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC50 of the compound, can be determined before use of compounds in vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted. For cells outside the organism, multiple methods exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to get the PKs in contact with the compounds including, but not limited to, direct cell microinjection and numerous transmembrane carrier techniques.<br>
"In vitro" refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium.<br>
"In vivo" refers to procedures performed within a living organism such as, without limitation, a mouse, rat or rabbit<br>
"PK related disorder," "PK driven disorder," and "abnormal PK activity" all refer to a condition characterized by inappropriate, i.e., under or, more commonly, over, PK catalytic activity, where the particular PK can be an RTK, a CTK or an STK. Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PK expression in cells which normally do not express PKs, (2) increased PK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PK refers to<br>
either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PK or production of a level of PK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PK activity decreases.<br>
"Treat", "treating" and "treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.<br>
"Organism" refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for example, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has at least one of the following effects:<br>
(1)	reducing the size of the tumor,<br>
(2)	inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis;<br>
(3)	inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and<br>
(4)	relieving  to some  extent (or,  preferably,  eliminating)  one  or more symptoms associated with the cancer.<br>
"Monitoring" means observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PK. The observed or detected effect can be a change in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PK or a change in the interaction of a PK with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art. The effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.<br>
"Cell phenotype" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and<br>
nutrient uptake and use.  Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techniques well-known in the art.<br>
"Natural binding partner" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PK in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PK-medlated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PK can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PK to mediate signal transduction.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Compounds of formulas I, II, III and Ilia can be made following the synthetic routes in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2. In Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 and the descriptions following, "BOC", "Boc" or "boc" means N-tert-butoxycarbonyl, DCM means CH2CI2, DIPEA (also known as Hunig's base) means diisopropyl ethyl amine, DMA means dimethyl amine, "DMP means dimethyl formamide, "DMSO" means dimethylsulfoxide, Et means -CH2CH3, "MTBE" means methyl t-butyl ether, NMP means 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, TEA means triethyl amine, TFA means trifluoro acetic acid, THF means tetrahydrofuran. While schemes 1 and 2 and the description refer to compound I, schemes 1 and 2 and the description are equally applicable to compounds II, III and IlIa.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of the intermediate l(a) used to make compounds of formula I. The amino group of the substituted amino acid l(a) is alkylated to give compound l(b). This can typically be done by treating compound l(a) with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. An activated electrophilic double bond moiety is a commonly used alkylating reagent. A typical reaction condition of alkylating 1(a) with an activated electrophilic double bond moiety is to treat 1(a) with the activated double bond moiety in the presence of a strong base. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound 1(b). The amino group of compound 1(b) is then protected with a boc group to give compound 1(c). This can typically be done by treating compound 1(b) with Boc agent in the presence of a base. A typical condition is to treat compound 1(b) with (Boc)2O in the presence of Me4NOH in MeCN as a solvent. The carboxylic acid group of compound 1(c) is then converted into a methyl ester of compound 1(d). A typical condition of converting the carboxylic acid group into the methyl ester group is to treat 1(c) with methyl iodide in DMF in the presence of a base. Compound 1(d) then undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to give compound 1(e). This can typically be done by treating compound 1(d) with a strong base in an aprotic solvent. A typical condition is to treat compound 1(d) with t-BuOK in toluene. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound 1(e). Compound 1(e) then undergoes a 2+3 cyclization with a hydrazine moiety to form compound 1(f). A typical condition of the cyclization is to reflux compound 1(e) with hydrazine and acetic acid in EtOH. The free base pyrazole nitrogen of compound 1(f) is then acylated to give compound 1(g). A typical condition of the acylation is to treat compound 1(f) with chloro ethyl carbonate in THF.<br>
More detailed synthetic conditions to compound 1(g) of Scheme 1 can be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171357 and PCT Publication WO 02/12242, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates two routes through which compounds of formula I can be made from intermediate 1(g). In the first route of Scheme 2, compound 1(g) undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R1 electrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that an amine functionality carries out. A typical acylation reaction condition is to treat compound 1(g) with an acylating agent such as R1-COCI, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DIPEA, in a solvent such as dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred at between 0°C and room temperature for 12 hours. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound  1(h). The Boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen of compound  1(h) is then<br>
removed to give compound 1(1). This can typically be done by treating 1(h) with a strong acid. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound 1(h) with 4N HCI in dioxane and DCM. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound l(i). The pyrrole NH of compound 1(1) is then acylated to give chloroformate l(j). This can typically be done using phosgene, triphosgene, or some equivalent. A typical reaction condition is to treat l(i) with 2 equivalents of triphosgene in DCM at 0°C for four hours. Subsequent miid basic workup with saturated NaHCO3 and purification gives compound l(j). Compound l(j) is then treated with an R1 nucieophile moiety. The nucieophile can be an alcohol, amine or one of many other functionalities that can react with the chloroformate l(j)- A typical reaction involves treating l(j) with a nucieophile such as 1.5 equivalents of an alcohol in the presence of 2 equivalents of base such as K2CO3 in a solvent such as DME. The reaction is heated to 80°C for eight hours and the solvent removed. Alternatively, l(J) can be treated with 1.5 equivalents of an amine in the presence of 1 equivalent of base such as DIPEA in a solvent such as THF. Subsequent work up in a protic solvent such as methanol in the presence of base such as TEA followed by purification give compound of formula I.<br>
Alternatively, compound l(i) can then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R4 electrophile give compound l(k). The nucleophilic reaction carried out for this transformation can be an alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination. An acylation reaction of l(l) to give l(k) is carried out by treating compound l(i) with an acylating reagent in the presence of base. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound l(i) with excess of base, such as DIPEA in DCM and adding the resulting solution to an isocyanate at 0°C. The reaction is stirred for 2 hours and subsequent aqueous workup gives compound l(k). The ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound l(k) is removed to give compound of formula I. This can typically be done by treating compound l(k) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux compound l(k) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound of formula I.<br>
In the second route of Scheme 2, the Boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen is removed to give compound l(l). The can typically be carried out by treating compound l(g) with a strong acid. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound 1(g) with 4N HCI in dioxane and DCM. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound 1(1). Compound 1(1) can then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R4 electrophile give compound l(m). Because the -NH2 group attached to the pyrazole in compound 1(1) is less reactive than the pyrrole nitrogen of 1(1), the transformation of 1(1) to l(m) can be carried out without protecting the pyrazole -NH2 group of compound 1(1). The nucleophilic reaction carried out for this transformation can be an alkylation, acylation, sulfonyiation, reductive amination.<br>
Relative mild reaction conditions are preferred to achieve the reaction selectivity. An acylation reaction of 1(1) to give l(m) is canied out by treating compound 1(1) with an acylating reagent in the presence of base. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound 1(1) with excess of base, such as DIPEA in DCM and adding the resulting solution to an isocyanate at 0°C. The reaction mixture is held at 0°C for about two hours and subsequent aqueous workup gives compound l(m).<br>
Compound l(m) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R1 electrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that an amine functionality carries out. A typical acylation reaction condition is to treat compound l(m) with an acylating agent such as R1-NCO in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DIPEA in a solvent such as dichloromethane for 2 hours. Alternatively, l(m) can be treated with an acylating agent such as R1-COOR, where R is an activating group such as p-nitrophenyl, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DIPEA, in a solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound l(n). The ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound l(n) is removed typically with a base to give the free base compound I. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound l(n) with TEA in a protic solvent such as methanol followed by purification to give compound of formula I.<br>
Alternatively, the ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound l(m) is removed to give the free base compound l(o). This can typically be done by treating compound l(m) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux compound l(m) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound l(o). Compound l(o) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R1 electrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that amine functionality carries out. A typical acylation reaction condition is to treat compound l(o) with an acylating agent such as R1-COCI, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DIPEA in a solvent such as dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred for four hours and subsequent aqueous workup and purification gives compound of formula I.<br>

It is understood when a particular salt of a free base compound B or a particular salt of an free acid compound A is disclosed in the current invention, the corresponding free base compound B or free acid compound A is also within the contemplation of the current invention. Treating the salt of free base compound B with small amount of aqueous K2CO3 followed by extraction of the aqueous solution with large amount of organic solvent usually affords free base compound B in good yield. If the free base compound B is extremely water soluble, it is recommended appropriate organic solvent be used to dissolve the salt followed by adding solid K2CO3. Subsequent filtration or chromatography usually affords free base compound B. Free acid compound A can be obtained from its salt following similar methods.<br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminum, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.<br>
For a review on suitable salts, see "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use" by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the inventive compounds can be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the compound and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non-ionized.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol.

Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include hydrates and solvates wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Also included within the scope of the Invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are polymorphs, prodrugs, and isomers (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) of the inventive compounds<br>
Derivatives of compounds of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves but can, when administered to a patient, be converted into the inventive compounds, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in 'Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and 'Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design', Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the Invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the Inventive compounds with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs" by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:<br>
(i) where the compound contains a carboxylic acid functionality (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C8)alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R # H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with (C1-C10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found In the aforementioned references.<br>
Finally, certain inventive compounds may themselves act as prodrugs of other of the inventive compounds.<br>
Compounds of the invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. A single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the inventive compounds, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the countenon is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.<br>
Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>

The invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, wherein one or more atoms is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually<br>
found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125l, nitrogen, such as 13N and 15N, oxygen, such as 150, 170 and 180, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulfur, such as 35S. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, 3H, and carbon-14, 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of Incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as i1C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, do-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products, or mixtures thereof.

Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may include one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; or encapsulated.<br>
The formulation of tablets is discussed in detail in "Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1", by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., N.Y., 1980 (ISBN 0-8247-6918-X), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles can be found in Verma et al, Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14 (2001).

Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, Intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.<br>
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile nonaqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilization, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of the invention used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and PGLA microspheres. <br>

Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.<br>
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate.

Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and nonbiodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.<br>
Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release. <br>
Other Technologies<br>
Compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both Inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer.  Most commonly<br>
used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Dosage<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day. <br>
Kit-of-Parts<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention includes two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.<br>
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically includes directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid. <br>

Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant PAK4 Kinase domain (PAK4 KD): The cDNA coding for PAK4 was amplified from the EST clone (#12) (purchased from Research Genetics) by using PCR. P33 (ACATATG TCC CATGAGCAGT TCCGGGCTGC CCTGCAGCT) and P34 (CTCA TGGGTGCTTC AGCAGCTCGG CTGCCGTGGC) were used as the 5' primer and 3' primer in PCR respectively. The PCR amplified product was cloned into Topo vector (Invitrogen Inc.), and verified by DNA sequencing. PAK4 KD was then subcloned into expression plasmid pET28a(+), pET24a(+), or pGST4.5. The recombinant plasmids containing PAK4 KD was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for recombinant protein expression. The production of PAK4 KD was induced at 27"C by the addition of IPTG into the cells. The cells were then harvested and lyzed for protein purification. Ni-NTA column (pET28a(+), pET24a(+)) and glutathione column (pGST4.5) were used for the purification. The purified protein was then subjected to thrombin to cleave the N-terminal tags that were inherited from the expression plasmids, and thus gave the PAK4 KD that were used for the KI assay of this invention.<br>
PAK4 kinase domain enzymatic assay conditions: the enzymatic activity of PAK4 KD was measured by its ability to catalyze the transfer of a phosphate residue from a nucleoside triphosphate to an amino acid side chain of a commercially available peptide (amino acid sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM). The conversion of ATP to ADP accompanies the catalytic reaction. The PAK4 KD catalyzed production of ADP from ATP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH through the activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The conversion of NADH to NAD+ is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (e340 = 6.22 cm-1mM-1) using a Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 190 in conjunction with the Biomec FX. Typical reaction solutions contain 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mM NADH, 10 mM MgCI2, 1 mM DTT, 0.4mM peptide (EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) 0.04 mM ATP, 1 units/mL PK, 1 units/mL LDH, 0.01% Tween 20 in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assays are initiated with the addition of 25nM PAK4 KD. The PAK KD Ki of each compound of the invention (the inhibitor) was calculated based on multiple of Percent Inhibition numbers of the inhibitor at different inhibitor concentrations. The peptide (amino sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) was purchased from American Peptide Company. NADH, MgCI2, HEPES, DTT, ATP and PK/LDH were purchased from Sigma. Tween 20 was purchased from Calbiochem.<br>
A sandwich ELISA method was used to measure the PAK4 kinase activity in whole cells.      The level of PAK4-dependent phosphorylation of GEF-H1b can be<br>
determined by monitoring the binding of a phosphospecific antibody to GEF-H1b. A modified HEK 293 cell line is used in the bioassay and it has been engineered to overexpress both GEF-H1b and the kinase domain (KD) of PAK4. The KD of PAK4 is inducible in this cell line by tetracycline (Trex system, Invitrogen). The name of this cell line has been designated TR-293-KDG. To establish a phosphorylation event on GEF-H1, cells are induced with doxycycline to express the PAK4 KD. Negative control wells do not receive induction. Candidate substance effect is measured as the ability to block this phosphorylation event.<br>
ELISA plate was prepared by pre-coating the plates with a capture antibody (a-HA-tag mouse monoclonal anitibody), blocked with BSA, and washed in 0.1% tween 20 in tris-buffered saline (TBST). Tissue culture plates (precoated with poly-D-lysine) were seeded with TR-293-KDG cells. The TR-293-KDG Cells were induced to express the PAK4 KD with doxycycline overnight and subsequently &amp; concomitantly treated with candidate substances or diluent for an additional 3-hour, continuous exposure. Cells were then lysed with a modified RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The fresh whole cell lysates were then added to the ELISA plate for 2-hours. Between all subsequent steps plates were washed 4 times with TBST. Detection antibody (recognizing the phospho-specific eptitope on GEF-H1b) was added for 1 hour, followed by addition of an enzyme linked goat α-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 minutes. Color development of the enzyme-linked antibody was performed with a peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Moss, Inc.) with absorbance at 405nM read with a spectrophotometer after 30 minute incubation. EC50 values were calculated by sigmoid curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis.<br>

The details are provided in the following paragraphs.<br>
Material and preparation: The HCT116 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Bethesda, MD). Cells were grown as monolayers in McCoy's media each supplemented with 10% FBS (each from Life Technologies, Inc., Bethesda,<br>
MD) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Tumor cells for implantation into athymic mice were harvested near confluence by incubation with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Cells were pelleted at 450Xg for 5-10 minutes and the cell pellets were re-suspended in serum-free McCoy's medium supplemented with 50% matrigel. Tumor cells (1 x 106 cells/animal) were implanted s.c. into the hindflank region of each mouse on day 0 and allowed to grow to the designated size prior to the administration of compound for each experiment.<br>
Tumor growth inhibition: Treatment was initiated when tumors were approximately 200 mm3 in size. Compound of Example 2 or vehicle (methyl cellulose, MC) was administered as an oral gavage daily or every other day at 10 mL/kg. Tumors were measured using Vernier calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated utilizing the formula length X width2 X 0.4. Tumor volume was measured on the indicated days, with the median tumor volume indicated for each group of 12 animals; median ± SEM. At the end of the study, the maximum percent tumor growth inhibition was calculated as 100 X (tumor volumeflnal - tumor volumeintial) for Compound if Example 2-treated group/ (tumor volumefinal - tumor volumeinitial) for vehicle group on day 39 and tumor growth delay was calculated as median tumor volumetreated - median tumor volumecontrol when median tumor volume reached 1250 mm3.<br>
Tumor growth delay: Treatment with Compound of Example 2 began on day 11 when tumors reached a volume of ~200 mm3 and continued for 28 days until the control tumors reached evaluation size (1250 mm3). Tumor measurement continued until treated tumors reached evaluation size (1250 mm3) in order to assess tumor growth delay. Compound of Example 2 was administered to tumor-bearing mice by oral gavage as a solution in MC in 10 mL/kg volume and compared with vehicle alone administered in the same volume. Oral administration of Compound of Example 2 at 50 mg/kg/day or 75 mg/kg every other day was demonstrated to result in statistically significant tumor growth inhibition (p = 0.05) of 50% or 37%, respectively compared with vehicle-treated controls (Figure 1). In addition, a tumor growth delay of 12.2 or 9.8 days was observed at the 50 mg/kg/day or 75 mg/kg every other day dose levels, respectively (Figure 1). Mice administered Compound of Example 2 throughout the 28 day treatment cycle generally appeared healthy and continued to gain weight.<br>
