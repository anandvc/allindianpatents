[0030]<br>
A piston 48 slidably fitted inside the cylinder bore<br>
35	is linked with the crankshaft 34 via a connecting rod 49. A camshaft 50 is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 37, and an intake valve and an exhaust valve (respectively not shown) provided to the cylinder head 37 are opened and closed by the camshaft 50. A cam chain or timing chain 52 is drivably housed in a chain passage 51 provided to the right case half 40 of the crankcase 21, the cylinder block<br>

Hereby, the torque of the crankshaft 34 is transmirted to the camshaft 50 at speed reducing ratio of 1/2. [0031]<br>
An intake system 59 is connected to a side wall of an upper part of the cylinder head 37, and is provided with an intake pipe 55, a throttle body 57, and an air cleaner 58. A downstream end of the intake pipe 55 curved backward from the cylinder head 37 is connected to a side wall of an upper part of the cylinder head 37 and a fuel injection valve 56 is attached to the intake pipe 55. An upstream end of the intake pipe 55 is connected to the throttle body 57 arranged on the upside of the engine main unit 33, the throttle body 57 is connected to the air cleaner 58 (see Fig. 1) arranged on the upside of the transmission case 22, and a throttle valve 60 for controlling the quantity of intake air is openably arranged in the throttle body 57. [0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the transmission case 22 is configured by a case main body 61 integrated with the left case half 39 of the crankcase 21 in the engine main unit 33 and extended backward, a left cover 62 connected to the case main body 61 from the left, and a right cover 53 fastened to the rear of the case main body 61 from the right.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
The transmission M is configured by a belt type continuously variable transmission 64 that continuously shifts the torque of the crankshaft 34 and a speed reducing gear train 66 provided between an axle 65 of the rear wheel WR and the belt type continuously variable transmission 64. The belt type continuously variable transmission 64 is housed in a transmission chamber 67 formed between the case main body 61 and the left cover 62 in the transmission case 22 and the speed reducing gear train 66 is housed in a gear chamber 68 formed between the case main body 61 and the right cover 63 in the transmission case 22. [0034]<br>
The belt type continuously variable transmission 64 is provided with a driving pulley 70 provided to a left end of the crankshaft 34 in the transmission chamber 67, a driven pulley 71 arranged in the rear of the transmission chamber 67 and an endless V belt 72 wound onto the driving pulley 70 and onto the driven pulley 71. [0035]<br>
The driving pulley 70 is provided with a pulley half 73 on the fixed side fixed to the crankshaft 34 and a pulley half 74 on the movable side that can approach and can be separated from the pulley half 73 on the fixed side and the pulley half 74 on the movable side is pressed in a direction in which the pulley half on the movable side approaches the pulley half 73 on the fixed side by a centrifugal weight 75 moved on the outside in a radial<br><br>
direction as the number of revolutions of the crankshaft 34<br>
increases.<br>
[0036]<br>
An output shaft 76 having a parallel axis to the crankshaft 34 is rotatably supported by the case main body 61 and the right cover 63 in the rear of the transmission case 22, the driven pulley 71 is provided with a pulley half 77 on the fixed side supported relatively rotatably by the output shaft 76 and a pulley half 78 on the movable side that can approach and can be separated from the pulley half 77 on the fixed side, and the pulley half 78 on the movable side is pressed toward the pulley half 77 on the fixed side by a spring 79.  A clutch 80 for starting is provided between the pulley half 77 on the fixed side and the output shaft 76. [0037]<br>
The output shaft 76, an intermediate shaft 81 parallel to the output shaft 76 and the axle 65 are rotatably supported by the rear of the case main body 61 and the right cover 63 in the transmission case 22, the speed reducing gear train 66 is provided between the output shaft 76 and the axle 65 via the intermediate shaft 81, and the rear wheel WR is provided to a right end of the axle 65 protruded on the right side piercing the right cover 63, [0038]<br>
Therefore, the torque of the crankshaft 34 is transmitted to the driving pulley 70 and is transmitted from the driving pulley 70 to the rear wheel WR via the V<br><br>
belt 72, the driven pulley 71, the clutch 80 for starting<br>
and the speed reducing gear train 66.<br>
[0039]<br>
When the engine E is driven at low speed, centrifugal force that acts on the centrifugal weight 75 of the driving pulley 70 is small, therefore, groove width between the pulley half 77 on the fixed side and the pulley half 78 on the movable side is reduced by the spring 79 of the driven pulley 71, and the gear ratio is at a low level.  When the number of revolutions of the crankshaft 34 is increased from this condition, centrifugal force that acts on the centrifugal weight 75 increases, groove width between the pulley half 73 on the fixed side and the pulley half 74 on the movable side respectively of the driving pulley 70 decreases, and as the groove width between the pulley half 77 on the fixed side and the pulley half 78 on the movable side respectively of the driven pulley 71 is accordingly increased, the gear ratio continuously changes from the low level to a top level, [0040]<br>
A kick shaft 83 having a parallel axis to the crankshaft 34 is rotatably supported by the case main body 61 and a left cover 62 in an intermediate part in a longitudinal direction of the transmission case 22 and a kick pedal 84 is fixed to an end protruded from the left cover 62 of the kick shaft 83,  In addition, a return spring 85 is provided between the kick shaft 83 and the case main body 61.<br><br>
[0041]<br>
In the meantime, a fitting member 87 coaxially opposite to a fitted member 86 provided to the end of the crankshaft 34 is supported by the left cover 62 of the transmission case 22 so that the fitting member can be rotated coaxially with the crankshaft 34 and can be moved in an axial direction of the crankshaft, and a speed increasing gear train 8B is provided between the kick shaft 83 and the fitting member 87.  The rotation of the kick shaft 83 is increased by the speed increasing gear train 88 according to stepping on the kick pedal 84 and is transmitted to the fitting member 87, the fitting member 87 is forward rotated until it is fitted to the fitted member 8 6, and thereby, rotating motive power for starting is transmitted to the crankshaft 34. [0042]<br>
Plural vanes 89 for taking cooling air in the transmission chamber 67 by the rotation of the pulley half 73 on the fixed side are fixed to an outside face of the pulley half 73 on the fixed side of the driving pulley 70 and an outside air intake duct 90 for taking cooling air in the transmission chamber 67 from the outside by the rotation of the vanes 89 together with the pulley half 73 on the fixed side is attached to the front of the left cover 62 of the transmission case 22. A reed valve 91 for taking air for ventilation in the crankcase 21 is attached to the left side of the cylinder block 36 in the engine main unit 33.<br><br>

Further, a connecting pipe 154 for connecting a rubber hose is provided to the water supply pipe 137 and is<br><br>
connected to a reservoir (not shown) open to the atmosphere and arranged separately from the radiator 96.  When cooling water in the radiator 96 is turned high temperature and is expanded, extra cooling water flows into the reservoir and when the cooling water in the radiator 96 is turned low temperature, the cooling water is returned from the reservoir into the radiator 96.  Air accumulated in the water supply pipe 137 is exhausted into the reservoir by the above-mentioned flow of cooling water between the radiator 96 and the reservoir,  That is^ when the engine E is operated, air bleeding from the cooling system is also performed satisfactorily. [0064]<br>
In such a cooling system, when the warming up of the engine E is completed, cooling water discharged from the water pump 126 driven by the camshaft 50 is supplied to the water jacket 125 in the engine main unit 33 through the fourth conduit 150 and after the cooling water cools the engine E while it passes the water jacket 125, it is supplied to the upper tank 100 of the radiator 96 via the first conduit 141. The cooling water the temperature of which lowers while it flows from the upper tank 100 into the lower tank 101 via the cooling core 102 and passes the radiator 96 is returned to the suction opening 135 of the water pump 126 via the third conduit 149 and the thermostat 127.  In the meantime, when the engine E is in warming up and the temperature of cooling water is low, the thermostat 127 is operated to circulate the cooling water without<br><br>
passing the radiator 96, the cooling water flows from the water jacket 125 into the water pump 126 via the second conduit 146 and the thermostat 127 without passing the radiator 96, and the temperature promptly rises. [0065]<br>
As shown in Figs, 3 and 5, a position regulator 99a that blocks the turning to a released position of the cap 138 is integrated with the radiator cover 99 with the position regulator covering the cap 138.

Next, to explain the action of this embodiment, the radiator 96 is arranged on the side of the crankcase 21, the cooling fan 97 that sucks cooling wind to pass the cooling water in the radiator 96 is attached to one end of the crankshaft 34 and is arranged inside the radiator 96, the shroud 98 that is provided with the exhaust port lOB in the lower part and covers the cooling fan 97 from the side is provided between the radiator 96 and the supporting case 4Ga in the right case half 40 of the crankcase 21, and the current plate 122 for preventing cooling wind from the cooling fan 97 from flowing on the side of the crankcase 21 in the part corresponding to the exhaust port 108 is fixed not to the side of the exhaust port 108 and the cooling fan 97 but to the side of the crankcase 21, [0067]<br>
Therefore, as cooling wind sucked by the cooling fan<br><br>
97 and passing the radiator 96 is prevented from flowing from the cooling fan 97 to the side of the crankcase 21 in the vicinity of the exhaust port 108 of the shroud 98 by the current plate 122 and smoothly flows into the exhaust port 108, the cooling efficiency of the radiator 96 can be enhanced. [0068]<br>
As the current plate 122 is attached to the shroud 98 and the shroud 98 to which the current plate 122 is attached can be attached to the crankcase 21, the current plate 122 never obstructs when the cooling fan 97 is attached to the crankshaft 34, compared with a case that the current plate 122 is attached to the crankcase 21 and ease of assembly can be enhanced. [0069]<br>
In addition, as the current plate 122 is formed in the shape of the circular arc along the rotational locus of the outermost end in the radial direction of the cooling fan 97 in the side view^ a flow of cooling wind from the cooling fan 97 to the side of the crankcase 21 can be more effectively blocked. [0070]<br>
Further, as the generator 95 is arranged between the cooling fan 97 and the crankcase 21 and the turned part 122a extended from the inner end of the current plate 122 to the side of the crankcase 21 is integrated with the current plate 122 arranged outside the generator 95, cooling wind can more smoothly flow on the side of the<br><br>
exhaust port 108 without causing turbulence in a small quantity of cooling wind that flows between the generator 95 and the current plate 122 by making the turned part 122a opposite to the periphery of the generator 95. [0071]<br>

[0072]<br>
Therefore, air in the water jacket 125 is led on the side of the radiator 96 via the first conduit 141, no conduit dedicated to air bleeding is required, interference between the first conduit 141 and the supporting shaft 43 can be avoided, the number of parts is reduced, and a conduit layout around the radiator 96 can be simplified. [0073]<br>
In addition, as the supporting shaft 43 is arranged at the back of the front end of the radiator 96, the inclination of the first conduit 141 is inhibited and the length of the first conduit 141 can be reduced.<br><br>

[0075]<br>
Besides, as the inlet pipe 139 is provided to the upper tank 100 of the radiator 96 with the inlet pipe having an axis extending in the longitudinal direction of the body frame F and located on the upside of the supporting shaft 43 in the side view, an overhang in front of the inlet pipe 139 from the radiator 96 is inhibited and the whole radiator 96 can be compacted. [0076]<br>
Besides, as the thermostat 127 provided with the thermostat case 134 the axis of which is inclined so that the upside is located more outside is arranged in front of the radiator 96, the water jacket-side connecting pipe 145 for connecting the second conduit 146 for leading cooling water from the water jacket 125 is protruded inward and<br><br>
