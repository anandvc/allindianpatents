[0001)	This apphcation claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/424,410, filed November 6,2002, and US- Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial No, 60/430,861, filed December 4, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002)	The present invention relates to transgenic mauocot plants which axe<br>
transformed with a nucleic acid encoding an enzyme in die trehalose biosynthetic<br>
pathway to increase tolerance to low temperature stress, water stress, and salt stress.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The explosive increase in world population, along with the continuing<br>
deterioration of arable land, scarcity of fresh water, and increasing environmental stress pose serious threats to global agricultural production and food security. Despite focused efforts to improve major crops for resistance to abiotic stresses such as drought, excessive salinity, and low temperature by traditional breeding,, success has been limited (Boyer, J, S., "Plant Productivity and Environment," Science, 218:443-448 (1982)), This lade of desirable progress is attributable to the fact that tolerance to abiotic stress is a complex trait that is influenced by coordinated and differential expression of a network of genes. Fortunately, it is now possibleto use transgenic approaches to improve abiotic stress tolerance in agriculturally importanttrops with far fewer target traits than had been anticipated (Zhang et d., "Engineering Salt-Tolerant Brassica Plants: Characterization of Yield and Seed Oil Quality in Transgenic Plants wife Increased Vacuolar Sodium Accunulation," Proc, Natl Acad. Set. USA, 98:12832-12836 (2001)).<br>
[0004]	Abiotic stresses can directly or indirectly affect (he physiological status<br>
of an organism by altering its metabolism, growth, and development A common response of organisms to drought, salinity, and low-cmperature stresses is the accumulation of sugars and other compatible solutes (Hare et aL, 'Dissecting the<br><br>
Roles of Osmolyte Accumulation During Stress "Plant Cell Environ., 21:535-553<br>
(1998)). These compounds serve as osmoprotectants and, in some cases, stabilize<br>
biomolecuks under stress conditions (Hire et aL, "Dissecting the Roles of Osmolyte<br>
Accumulation During Stress," Plant Cell Environ., 21:535-553 (1998); Yancey et aL,<br>
'living with Water Stress: Evolution of Osmolyte Systems,* Science, 217:1214-1222<br>
(1982))- One such compound is trehalose, anonredudng disaccharide of glucose,<br>
which plays an important physiological role as an abiotic stress protectant in a huge<br>
number of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, and invertebrates (Crowe et aL,<br>
"Anhydrobiosis3w^wnw. Rev. Physiol, 54:579-599 (1992))- Trehalose has been shown<br>
to stabilize dehydrated enzymes, proteins, and lipid membranes efficiently, as well as<br>
protect biological structures from damage during desiccation. In the plant kingdom,<br>
most species do not seem to accumulate detectable amounts of trehalose, with the<br>
notable exception of the highly desiccation-tolerant "resurrection plants" (Wingler,<br>
"The Function of Trehalose Biosynthesis in Plants," PhytocJiermstry‚Äù 60:437-440<br>
(2002)). The recent discovery of homologous genes for trehalose biosynthesis in<br>
Selagimlla lepidophytta, Arabidopsis thaliana, and several crop plants suggests that<br>
the ability to synthesize trehalose may be widely distributed in the plant kingdom<br>
(Goddijn et aL, "Trehalose Metabolism in Plants," Trends Plant ScL9 4:315-319<br>
(1999))- A putative plant gene for trehalose-6*phosphate synthase (TPS)can<br>
complement a &amp;tpsl mutant yeast strain, suggesting that the plant and yeast gene<br>
products are functionally similar (Zentella et aL, "A Selaginella lepidophytta<br>
Tiehalose-6-Phosphate Synthase Complements Growth and Stress-Tolerance Defects<br>
in a Yeast tpsJ Mutant," Plant Physiol, 119:1473-1482 (1999)).<br>
[0005]	In bacteria and yeast, trehalose is synthesized in a two-step process:<br>
trehalose-6-phosphate is first formed fiom UDP-glucoseand gjtocose-6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by TPS. Trehalose-6-phosphaieis then converted to trehalose by trehalos--6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) (Goddijn et aL, "Trehalose Metabolism in Plants,'1 Trends Plant Set, 4:315-319 (1999)). Metabolic engineering for enhanced accumulation of trehalose in plants has been the recent focus of attentionin some model dicot plants (Holmstrom et aL, "Drought Tolerance in Tobacco," Nature, 379:683-684 (1996); Goddijn et aL, 'Inhibition of Trehalase Activity Enhances Trehalose Accumulation in Transgenic Plants, Plant Pjysiol, 113:181-190 (1997);<br><br>
Romero et aL, "Expression of the Yeast Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Transgenic Tobacco Plants: Pleiotropic Phenotypes Include Draught Tolerance," Plants 201293-297 (1997); Pilon-Smits et aL, "Trehalose-Producing Transgenic Tobacco Plants Show Improved Growth Performance Under Drought Stress," J. Plant Physiol? 152:525-532 (1998)). However, in these previous studies, constitutive ova-expression of TPS and/or TPP genes from yeast at Escherichia coli in tobacco or potato plants resulted in undesirable pleiotiopic effects, including stunted growth and altered metabolism under normal growth conditions (Goddijn et aL, "Inhibition of Trehalase Activity Enhances Trehalose Accumulation in Transgenic Plants," Plant Physiol, 113:181-190 (1997); Romero et aL, "Expression of the Yeast Itehalosc-6-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Transgenic Tobacco Plants: Pleiotiopic Phenotypes Include Drought Tolerance," Plants 201:293-297 (1997); Pilon-Smits et aL, 'Trehalose-Producing Transgenic Tobacco Plants Show Improved Growth Performance Under Drougit Stress," 1 Plant Physiol, 152:525-532 (1998)). The present invention is directed to producing transgenic monocot plants with improved low temperature stress, water stress, and salt stress tolerance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The present invention relates to a transgenic monocot plant transformed<br>
with a nucleic acid encoding an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis, under the control of an inducible promoter, that confers low temperature, salt, and water stress tolerance to a monocot plant<br>
[0007]	The present invention further relates to a monocot plant cell or<br>
protoplast transformed with a nucleic acid encoding an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis, under control of an inducible promoter, that confers low temperature, salt, and water stress tolerance to a monocot plant regenerated from a monocot plant cell or protoplast<br>
[0008]	The present invention also relates to a method of conferring tolerance<br>
to low temperature, salt, and water stress to a monocot plant by transforming a monocot plant cell or protoplast with a nucleic add encoding an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis, under control of an inducible promoter, under conditions effective to<br><br>
impart low temperature, salt and water stress tolerance to monocot plants regenerated from the monocot plant cell or protoplast<br>
[0009)	Another aspect of the present invention further relates to a method of<br>
increasing tolerance of monocot plant to low temperature, salt, or water stress conditions by increasing the levels of an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis in the monocot plant<br>
[0010]	The present invention also relates to a transgenic monocot plant<br>
transformed wife a plasmid feat confers low temperature, salt, and water stress<br>
tolerance to the monocot plant where fee plasmid comprises a first nucleic acid<br>
encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, a first inducible promoter, fee promoter<br>
located 5' to fee first nucleic add and controlling expression of fee first nucleic acid,<br>
and a first termination sequence located 3' to the first nucleic acid.<br>
[0011]	Considering fee importance of rice as a major crop, developing new.<br>
cultivars wife enhanced abiotic stress tolerance would undoubtedly have an enormous<br>
impact on global food production. It was decided to improve abiotic stress tolerance<br>
by transfbnningrice wife a irehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase (TPSP) fusion<br>
gene feat includes fee coding regions of the ¬£. coli ot&amp;A and otsB genes (encoding<br>
IPS and TPP, respectively) (Seo et aL, "Characterization of a Bifunctional Enzyme<br>
Fusion of Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthetase and Trehalose-6-Phosphafce Phosphatase<br>
of Escherichia coli? Appl Environ, Microbiol, 66:2484-2490(2000))- Ibis approach<br>
has fee dual advantages of necessitating only a single transformation event and<br>
producing a higher net catalytic efficiency for trehalose formation (Seo ct at,<br>
"Characterization of a Bifunctional Enzyme Fusion of Trehalose-6-Phosphate<br>
Synthetase and Trehalose-6-Phosphate Phosphatase of Escherichia coli," Appl<br>
Environ. Microbiol, 66:2484-2490(2000)), Because indica ricevarieties represent<br>
80% of rice grown worldwide, fee economically valuable indica rice Pusa Basmati-1<br>
(PB-1) was chosen to transform, even though transformation and regeneration are<br>
more difficultfean in  japonica ricevarieties. Therefore, whatever has been<br>
accomplished wife an indica rice works equally well wife japonica rice variety.<br>
[0012]	It was shown feat engineering trehalose overproduction in rice can be<br>
achieved by stress-inducible or tissue-specific expression of bifunctional TPSP fusion enzyme without any detrimental effect on plant growth or grain yield.During abiotic<br><br>
stress, transgenicplants accumulated increased amounts of trehalose and showed high levels of tolerance to salt, drought, and low-temperature stresses, as compared with the nontransfoimed plant These results demonstrate the potential use of the transgenic approach in developing newrice cultivars with increased abiotic stress tolerance and enhanced riceproductivity.<br>
[0013]	The present invention allows the production of monocot plants with<br>
increased tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress and water stress (drought). In particular, increased tolerance in response to low temperature, salt, and water stress can be achieved by the activation of trehalose biosynthesis under the control of an inducible promoter.<br>

[0034]	In a preferred embodiment, the expression cassette comprising the<br>

could be RNA or DNA and which is preferably cDNA, encoding a molecule that<br>
increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress in monocot<br>
plants. The nucleic acid can be biologically isolated or synthetic and encodes for an<br>
enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. la the following Examples, a key enzyme for<br>
biosynthesis, trebalose-6-phosphate synthase (IPS), is encoded by the otsA gene of R<br>

[0036]	Transformation of plant cells can be accomplished by using a plasmid.<br>
The plasmid is used to introduce the nucleic add that increases tolerance to salt stress<br>
and drought stress in plants into the plant cell. Accordingly, a plasmid preferably<br>
includes a DNA molecule that increases tolerance to salt stress and drought stress in<br>
plants inserted into a unique restriction endomiclease cleavage site. Heterologous<br>
DNA, as used herein, refers to DNA not normally present in the particular host cell<br>
transformed by the plasmid. DNA is inserted into the vector using standard cloning<br>
procedures readily known in the ait This generally involves the use of restriction<br>
enzymes and DNA ligases, as described by Sambrook et aL, Molecular Cloning; A<br>
Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, New York, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The<br>
resulting plasmid, which includes a nucleic acid that, increases tolerance to salt stress<br>
and drought stress in plants can then be used to transform a host cell, such as an<br>
Agrobacterium and/or a plant cell. (See generally, Plant Molecular Biology Manual,<br>
2d Edition, Gelvin et al., Eds,, Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, Netherlands<br>
(1994), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).<br>
[00371	For plant transformation, the plasmid preferably also includes a<br>
selectable marker for plant transformation. Commonly used plant selectable markers include the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene, the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase gene (bar), the 5-enolpyrovylshndmate-3-phosphatesynthase-gene<br><br>
(EPSPS), neomycin 3'-0-phosphotransferase gene (npt H), or acetolactate synthase<br>
gene (ALS), Monnation on these selectable markers can be found in "Markers for<br>

ID a preferred embodiment, the plasmid includes the phosphmothricin acetyl<br>
transferase gene (bar) in a selection cassette as a selectable marker lor plant<br>

[0038]	hi a preferred embodiment, the plasmid is designated pSB109-TPSP or<br>
pSB-RTSP, each of which includes an otsA and ots B fusion gene.<br>
[0039]	For plant transformation, the plasmid also preferably includes a nucleic<br>
acid molecule encoding a 3' terminator such as that from the 3* non-coding region of<br>
genes encoding a proteinase inhibitor, actin 1, or nopaline synthase (nos). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the plasmid includes a nucleic add molecule encoding the 3'<br>
non-coding region of the proteinase inhibitor II gene (pinII) as a 3' terminator for the<br>
expression cassette comprising the inducible promoter and the nucleic acid encoding<br>
an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. Preferably, the plasmid includes a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding 3' non-coding region of the nopaline synthase gene (nos) as a 3'<br>
terminator for the selection cassette for plant transformation<br>
[0040]	Other suitable plasmids for use in the subject invention can be<br>
constructed. For example, genes encoding a nucleic acid that increases trehalose biosynthesis and that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress in monocot plants other than the otsA gene or the otsB gene of E. coli could be ligated into the parent plasmid SB109-TPSP or SB-RTSP after  use of restriction enzymes to remove the otsA gene, the ots B-gene, or the ots AlotsB fusion gene. Other minimal promoters could replace the rice actin 1 gene promoter present in plasmid SB109-TPSP or the rbcS gene promoter in plasmid SB-RTSP- Alternatively, other plasmids in general containing genes encoding a nucleic acid that increases trehalose biosynthesis and that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress in monocot plants under the control of a suitable minimal promoter, with suitable selectable markers, can be readily constructed using techniques well known in the art<br><br>
[0041]	Having identified the plasmid, one technique of transforming monocot<br>
plant cells with a nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress in plants is by contacting the plant cell with an inoculum of an Agrobacterium bacteria transformed with the plasmid comprising the nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress in monocot plants. Generally, this procedure involves inoculating the plant cells with a suspension of the transformed bacteria and incubating the cells for 48 to 72 hours on regeneration medium without antibiotics at 25-28¬∞C.<br>
[0042]	Bacteria from the genus Agrobacterium can be utilized to transform<br>
plant cells. Suitable species include Agrobacterium tumefaeiens and Agrobacterium<br>
rhizogenes. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (e.g., strains LBA4404 or EHA105) is<br>
particularly useful due to its well-known ability to transform plants.<br>
[0043]	In inoculating the cells of plants with Agrobacterium according to the<br>
subject invention, the bacteria must be transformed with a vector, whidi indudes a gene encoding for an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis.<br>
[0044]	Plasmids, suitable for incorporation mAgrobacterium, whidi indude a<br>
nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, sail stress, and water<br>
stress in plants, contain an origin of replication for replication in the bacterium<br>
Escherichia co% an origin of replication for replication in the bacterium<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, T-DNA right border sequences for transfer of genes to<br>
plants, and marker genes for selection of transformed plant-cells. Particularly<br>
preferred is the vector pBI121, whidi contains a low-copy RK2 origin of replication,<br>
the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptH) marker gene with a nopaline synthase (NOS)<br>
promoter and a NOS 3' polyadenylation signal. T-DNA plasmid vector pBI121 is<br>
available fee Clontech Laboratories, 4030 Fabian Way, Palo Alto, California 94303.<br>
A nucleic add that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water<br>
stress in monocot plants is inserted into die vector to replace the beta-glucuronidase<br>
(GUS) gene.<br>
[0045]	Typically, Agrobacterium spp. are transformed with a plasmid by direct<br>
uptake of plasmid DNA after chemical and beat treatment, as described by Holsters ct al, "Transaction and Transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, "Mol Gen. Genet, 163:18 1-187 (1978), whidi is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety;<br><br>

ScL USA, 77:7347-7351 (1981)s which is hereby incorporated, by reference in its entirety; or by direct conjugation transfer from Escherichia coli to Agrobacterium as described by Simon et aL, "A Broad Host Range Mobilization System for in vivo Genetic Engineering: Transposon Mutagenesis in Gram-Negative Bacteria," Biotechnology, 1:784-791 (1982), which is hereby incoiporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0046]	Another method for introduction of a containing nucleic acid encoding<br>
an enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis into a plant cell is by transformation of the plant<br>
cell nucleus, such as by particle bombardment. As used throughout this application,<br>
particle bombardment (also known as Holistic transformation) of the host cell can be<br>
accomplished in one of several-ways. The first involves propelling inert or<br>
biologically active particles at cells. This technique is disclosed in U,S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,945,050,5,036,006, and 5,100,792, all to Sauford et aL, which are benfcy<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Generally, this procedure involves propelling<br>
inert or biologically active particles at the cells under conditions effective to penetrate<br>
the outer surface of the cell and to be incorporated within the interior thereol When<br>
inert particles are utilized, the plasmid can be introduced into the cell  by coating the<br>
particles with the plasmid containing the heterologous DNA, Alternatively, fee target<br>
cell can be surrounded by die plasmid so that the plasmid is carried into the cell by the<br>
wake of the particle. Biologically active particles (e.g., dried bacterial cells containing<br>
the plasmid and heterologous DNA) can also be propelled into plant cells.<br>
[0047]	A further method for introduction of the plasmid into a plant cell is by<br>
transformation of plant cell protoplasts (stable or transient). Plant protoplasts are enclosed only by a plasma membrane and will therefore take up macromolecules like heterologous DNA. These engineered protoplasts can be capable of regenerating whole plants. Suitable methods for introducing heterologous DNA into plant cell<br><br>
protoplasts include electroporation and polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation As<br>
used throughout this application, dectroporation is a transformation method in which,<br>
generally, a high concentration of DNA (containing heterologous DNA) is added to a<br>
suspension of host cell protoplasts and the mixture shocked with an electrical field of<br>
200 to 600 V/crru Following electroporation, transformed cells are identified by<br>
growth on appropriate medium containing a selective agent<br>
[0048]	As used throughout this application, transformation encompasses stable<br>
transformation in which the plasmid is integrated into the plant chromosomes.<br>
[0049]	In the Examples which follow, rice has been transformed using the<br>
Agrobacterium method as described in Hiei et aL, "Efficient Transformation of Rice<br>
(Oryza sativa L.) Mediated by Agrobaeteritm and Sequence Analysis of the<br>
Boundaries of the T-DNA," The Plant Journal, 6:271 -282 (1994), which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety- biolistic transformation. Other methods of<br>
transformation have also been used to successfully transform rice plants, including the<br>
protoplast method (for a review, see Cab et al, "Regeneration of Herbicide Resistant<br>
Transgenic Rice Plants Following Microprqjectile-Mediated Transformation of<br>
Suspension Culture Cells," Plant CellRep., 11:586-591 (1992), which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirely), and the biolistic transformation method<br>
(disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,945,050,5,036,006, and 5,100,792, all to Sanford et<br>
aL, which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Biolistic<br>
transformation has been used successfully to transform wheat (for a review, see<br>
Weeks et aL, "Rapid Production of Multiple Independent Lines of Fertile Transgenic<br>
Wheat (Triticum aestivum)," Plant Physiol, 102:1077-1084 (1993), which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety). Biolistic transformation has also been vsed<br>
to successfully transform maize (for a review, see Macfeey et al, "Transgenic Maize,<br>
In Transgenic Plants, Rung et aL, Eds., vol. 2, pp- 21-33 (1993), whick is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety) and wheat (see Patent No. 5,405,765 to Vasil<br>
et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety),<br>
[0050]	Once a monocot plant cell or protoplast is transformed in accordance<br>
with the present invention, it is regenerated to form a transgenic monocot plant Generally, regeneration is accomplished by culturing transformed cells or protoplasts on medium containing the appropriate growth regulators and nutrients to allow-for the<br><br>
initiation of shoot mexistems. Appropriate antibiotics are added to the regeneration<br>
medium to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium or other contaminants and to select<br>
for the development of transformed cells or protoplasts. Following shoot initiation,<br>
shoots are allowed to develop in tissue culture and are screened for marker gene<br>
activity.<br>
[0051]	In suitable transformation methods, the monocot plant cell to be<br>
transformed can be in vitro or in vivo, ie. the monocot plant cell can be located in a<br>
monocot plant<br>
[0052]	The present invention also relates to a transgenic monocot plant<br>
transformed with a nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt<br>
stress, and water stress operably linked to an inducible promoter.<br>
[0053]	The invention also provides seed produced by the transgenic monocot<br>
plant. The invention is also directed to seed, which upon germination, produces the<br>
transgenic monocot plant<br>
[0054]	Also encompassed by the present invention are transgenic monocot<br>
plants transformed with fragments of the nucleic acids that increase tolerance to low<br>
temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress of the present invention. Suitable<br>
fragments capable of conferring low temperature stress, salt stress or water stress<br>
tolerance to monocot plants can be constructed by using appropriate restriction sites.<br>
A fragment refers to a continuous portion of the nucleic add that increases tolerance<br>
to salt stress and drought stress that is less than the entire molecule,<br>
[0055]	Non-essential nucleotides could be placed at the 5' and/or 3f ends of the<br>
fragments (or the foil length nucleic acids that increase tolerance to salt stress and<br>
drought stress) without affecting the functional properties of the fragment or molecule<br>
(Ie. in increasing water stress or salt stress tolerance). For example, the nucleic add<br>
that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress may be<br>
conjugated to a signal (or leader) sequence at the N-tenninal end-(for example) of the<br>
nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water<br>
stress which co-translationally or post-ttanslationally directs transfer of the nucleic<br>
add that increases tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water steess.<br>
The nudeotide sequence may also be altered so that the nndeic add that increases<br><br>
tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress is conjugated to a<br>
linker or other sequence for ease of synthesis, -purification, or identification.<br>
[0056]	The transgenic cereal plant cell or protoplast or plant can also be<br>
transformed with a nucleic acid encoding a selectable marker, such as the for gene, to allow for detection of transfoimants9 and with a nucleic add encoding the cauliflower mosaic vims 35S promoter to control expression of the bar gene. Other selectable maricers include genes encoding EPSPS, npffi, or ALS. Other promoters include those from genes encoding actin 1, rbcS, ubiquitin, and PINU These additional nucleic add sequences can also be prdvided by the plasmid encoding a gene that imparts tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress and its promoter. Where appropriate, the various nucleic acids could also be provided by transformation with multiple plasmids.<br>
[00571	While the nucleic acid that increases tolerance to low temperature<br>
stress, salt stress, and water stress referred to herein encodes, for example, a gene that imparts tolerance to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress, nucleotide identity to previously sequenced to low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress genes is not required. As should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, various nucleotide substitutions are possible which are silent mutations (i.e. the amino acid encoded by the particular codon does not change). It is also possible to substitute a. nucleotide which alters the amino acid encoded by a particular codon, where the amino acid substituted is a conservative substitution (i.e. amino add "homology" is conserved). It is also possible to have minor nucleotide and/or amino acid additions, deletions, and/or substitutions in the low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress gene nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences which have minimal influence on the properties, secondary structure, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the encoded low temperature stress, salt stress, and water stress -gene. These variants are encompassed by the present invention.<br><br>

The bomogenate was clarified by sentriiugation at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4¬∞C. The procedure for immmioblotting was essentially the same as described (Xu et aL, 'Expression of a Late Embtyogenesis Abundant Protein Gene, HVA1, from Barley Confers Tolerance to Water Deficit and Salt Stress in Transgenic Rice/1 Plant Physiol 110:249-257 (1996), which is hereby ncoiporated by reference in its entirety). The anti-TPSP protein polyclonal antibody vas used at a 1:1,500 dilution for Western blot analysis, using an alkaline phosphatase :olor reaction for detection of the protein, as per the manufacturer's instruction (Bio-lad).<br>

Example 9 ‚Äî Transgenic Rice Plants with Enhanced Trehalose Levels Are Phenotypically Normal and Fertile<br>
[0066]	Twoplasmid constructs, pSB109-TPSP (Fig. 1 A,c) and pSB-RTSP<br>
(Fig. 1B, C), each containing the TPSP fusion gene, were introducedinto indica rice cells of PB-1 by Agrobacterwm-mediated gene transfer (HIE  et at, 'Efficient<br>

In the plasmid construct pSB109-TPSP, an ABA and stress-indudble promoter (Su et aL, TDehydration-Stiess-Regulated Transgene Expression in Stably Transformed Rice Plants," Plant Physiol, 117:913- 922 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) drives the fusion gene for cytosolic expression. In the other plasmid, pSB-RTSP, the light-regulated promoter (Kyozuka et al., Tight-Regulated and Cell-Specific Expression of Tomato rbcS-gusA and Rice rbcS-gusA Fusion Genes in Transgenic Rice,"plant Physiol, 102:991-1000 (1993)? which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) of the Rubisco small submit geoe, rbcS, from Oryza safiva with a transit peptide drives the fusion gene for chloropIast targeting in the leaf mesopbyll cells. A large number of putative transgenic PB-1 plants (T0 generation) were regenerated (Table 1); these plants included 28 A-lines (ABA-indudble promoter) and 76 R-lines. (fbcS promoter).<br>

Integration of the TPSP transgene was confirmed by DNA-blot hybridization analysis (Fig. 1D and E). Based on the T~DNA junction fragment analysis, =40% of the<br><br>
transgenic plants transformed with either of the plasmids harbor a single copy, and 35' 45% of plants harbor two or three copies of the transgene.<br>
[0067]	Most of the 90 independent primary transformants (To) that contained a<br>
low copy number of the transgene showed a normal phenotype and were completely fertile. In contrast to previous reports that used constitutive promoters driving individual TPS and/or TPP genes, the use of stress-inducible or tissue-specific promoters in this work appears to minimize the negative effects of the transgene on plant growth. The To plants were self-pollinated to obtain segregating Ti progeny for genetic and HPLC analysis. Forty-five transgenic lines showed a segregation pattern of 3:1 for the basta-herbicide resistance marker gene, HPLC analysis of leaf extracts showed that transgenic lines had a trehalose content that was between three times and eight times that of the nontransgenic plants (17 ¬± 5 jig of trehalose per g of fresh weight)- The identity of trehalose in the plant tissue extracts was confirmed by incubating samples in porcine trehalase followed by chromatographic analysis of the monosaccharide products (Figure 6), Physiological experiments were conducted for abiotic stress tolerance on homozygous plants through the T4 generation, because gene silencing has been reported to occur in the T3 generation, even though T2 and Ti generation plants were not silenced (Iyer et aL, Transgene Silencing in Monocots," Plant Mol Biol, 43:323-346 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The results JSnom many independent transgenic lines were consistent for salt-and drought-stress tolerance in each generation, except in few transgenic lines which had multiple copies of the transgene.<br>
Example 10- Transgenic Rice Plants Are Salt Tolerant and Maintain Balanced Mineral Nutrition<br>
[0068]	The T4 transgenic plants with either one or two copies of the transgene<br>
showed markedly enhanced salt tolerance during and subsequent to 4 weeks of 100 mM NaCl treatment under hydroponic growth conditions. Six independent transgenic plant lines (three A-lines and three R-iines) were analyzed in detail. For clarity of presentation, results from two representative transgenic lines (R80 and A05) are shown (Figure 2); results for the other four lines were very similar to the two lines presented After prolonged exposure to salt stress, almost all of the transgenic plants<br><br>
survived and displayed vigorous root and shoot growth. In contrast, all of the<br>
nontransfonned stressed (NTS) plants were either dead ornearly dead because of<br>
severe salt damage to the leaves and concomitant loss of chlorophyll Transgenic<br>
plants developed longer and itrickerioots than NTS plants after salt stress (Figure 2<br>
A). Salt stress severely inhibited the growth of shoot and roots ofNTS plants, as<br>
indicated by their lower dry weights compared with NTC plants. Shoot and root dry<br>
weights of both the transgenic lines (Figure 2 B) approached those of NTC plants,<br>
and, after removal of salt stress, the transgenic plants were able to grow, flower, and<br>
set normal viable seeds. To determine whether the TPSP gene product was present in<br>
the salt-stressed .plants, total protein was isolated from the leaf samples for Western<br>
blot analysis. Immnnoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against the<br>
fusion protein showed the presence of a protein with the expected apparent molecular<br>
mass of 88 fcDa only in the transgenic plants (Figure 2 Q,<br>
[0069]	To assess how trehalose accumulation in transgenic rice affected plant<br>
mineral nutrition during salt stress, shoot and root mineral content for the six independent transgenic lines and two nontransgenie lines were determined by using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (Table 2).<br>
Table 2. Plant mineral nutrient content (sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron ions) in shoots and roots of transgenic lines (R22, R38, R80 A05, A07, and A27) and nontransfonned control lines with or without salt stress<br>

After continuous salt stress (100 mM NaQ) for 4 weeks, NTS plants showed a very large increase in Na+ content in both shoots and roots compared with NTC5 whereas the increase in the shoots of all of-die transgenic plants was much smaller (Figure 2 D). The Na+ content of transgenic plant shoots was only 30-35% of the NTS plants after salt stress. The observed differences in shoot Na+ content between transgenic and NTS plants could be caused in part by a growth dilution because of the much fester growth rate of the transgenic plants under salt stress. Alternatively, trehalosemigbt have played a direct or indirect role in maintaining ion selectivity and, thus, facilitating cellular Na+ exclusion. This possibility is consistent with the report that in salt-stressed rice seedlings, the accumulation of Na+ in leaf tissues was not prevented by exogenous proline, hi contrast, treatment with exogenous trehalose significantly reduced the salt-induced accumulation of Na+ in the leaves Garaa et ah, "Effects of<br><br>
OsmoprotectantsUponNaQ StoixsmKke" Plant Physiol, 115:159-169 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety),<br>
[0070)	Transgenic lines R80 and A05 maintained shoot to root K* homeostasis<br>
both under nonstress and salt-stress conditions (Table2), After salt stress, the levels of<br>
shoot and root K* content in transgenic plants was similar to the nonstressed controls,<br>
while a fourfold decrease in root K+ in the NTS plants was seen (Figure 2 ¬£). Thus,<br>
the transgenic plants were able to maintain a higher level of selectivity for K* over<br>
Na+ uptake in the roots and Na1" exclusion from the shoots compared with the NTS<br>
plants. The maintenance of the Na"VK* ratio in both shoot and roots of transgenic<br>
plants (Figure 2 F) correlated with nearly normal plant growth and may be the basis<br>
for minimizing Na+ toxicity under salt stress. It is generally accepted that the<br>
maintenance of Na+/K^ homeostasis is an important aspect of salt tolerance (Rus et<br>
al., "AtHKTl is a Salt Tolerance Determinant that Controls Na+ Entry into Plant<br>
Roots," Proa Natl Acad ScL USA, 98:14150-14155 (2001) and Epstein, "Plant<br>
Biology: How Calcium Enhances Plant Salt Tolerance," Science, 280:1906-1907<br>
(1998), which are hereby incoiporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
[0071]	Several other changes in plant mineral status that may have played<br>
indirect roles in stress tolerance were seen in the transgenic lines compared with the NTCs. It was found that salt stress led to a significant increase in root and shoot Ca2* content in the NTS lines, whereas in the transgenic lines, this Na-mediated increase in Ca2+ content was only observed in the shoots and not the roots (Table 2)* This rise in Ca2* maybe caused by alterations in die ion selectivity of die transporters at high concentrations of Na* (Epstein, "Plant Biology: How Calcium Enhances Plant Salt Tolerance," Science, 280:1906-1907 (1998), whidi is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Significantly higher levels of shoot Fe ion content were also found in the transgenic lines compared with the NTCs (T Ale 2). It has been we31 documented that Fe, Cu, and Zn ions are essential for the function of critical antioxidant enzymes such as the superoxide dismutases that play a role in scavenging reactive oxygen species during a number of abiotic stresses (Epstein, 'Plant Biology: How Calcium Enhances Plant Sak Tolerance," Science, 280:1906-1907 (1998), Alscher et aL, 'Hole of Superoxide Dismutases^SODs) in Controlling Oxidative Stress in Plants, V. Etp. Bot., 53:1331-1341 -(2002), which we here  Koiporated<br><br>
by reference in their entirety), in general, the relationship between salt stress and plant mineral content is complex, and the links between elevated trehalose content and improved mineral status during salt stress are not known.<br>
Exampleill- Transgenic Rice Plants are Water Stress Tolerant<br>
[0072]	To study drought tolerance, 5-week-old nontransformed and transgenic<br>
seedlings grown in soil were subjected to two cycles stress. After the drought treatments, all IS plants of each line showed wilting and drought-induced rolling of the young leaves. Nontransgenic plants exhibited rolling of leaves within 48 h of the stress as compared with considerably fewer visual symptoms in transgenic plants during the same timeperiod, After two cycles of 100 h of drought stress and subsequent watering for 3 weeks, the growth of both the transgenic lines, R80 and A05 (Figure 3 5), were almost identical to nonstressed control plant {Figure 3 A). In contrast, the growth of the drougbt-stressed NTS was severely inhibited (Figure 3 J?).<br>
Example 12- Transgenic Rice Plants Produced Increased Amounts of Trehalose and Other Soluble Carbohydrates<br>
[0073)	To evaluate whether trehalose accumulation in plants might act as a<br>
positive regulator of stress tolerance, the levels of trehalose and other soluble carbohydrates were measured (Table 3).<br><br>
Table 3. Levels of trehalose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and total soluble carbohydrate content hi shoots of nontransformed (NT) and six transgenic rice lines (R22, R38, R80 A05, AG7, and A27) grown under no stress, salt-stressed (100 mM NaCl for 4 weeks), or drought-stressed (after first 100-hr drought stress cycle) conditions<br><br>
Means ¬± SD (n = 3) are presented. Soluble carbohydrate content data is presented as mg/g shoot fresh weight, except in the case of trehalose, where it is presented as jig/g fresh weight<br><br>
A low but significant amount of trehalose was detected in the shoots (17 jig/g fresh weight) of NTC plants; fheselevels increased significantly under salt or drought stresses. The transgenic plants grown under control conditions exhibited trehalose levels comparable with the NTS plants (Figure 4). After salt stress, the transgenic lines (R80 and A05) showed 2.5-3 times higher sboot trehalose levels compared with NTS plants, whereas after drought stress, trehalose levels in the transgenic lines increased 3- to 9-fold (Figure 4). Despite the similarities in tolerance levels exhibited by transgenic plants engineered to increase trehalose synthesis in either the cytosol or chloroplast, R-lines showed considerable protection at much lower trehalose concentrations during drought stress (Table 3), In general, there was no obvious relationship between trehalose accumulation and stress tolerance among the transgenic lines evaluated On the other hand, the difference in trehalose levels between the transgenic and nontransgenic lines clearly correlates with increased tolerance to abiotic stress.<br>
Example 13- Transgenic Rice Plants Show Improved Photosystem II Function<br>
[0074]	During many different abiotic stresses, a reduction in photosynthesis<br>
and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species are thought to be a major contributor to decreased plant performance and photooxidative damage. The effects of increased trehalose accumulation on photosynthesis during drought stress were assessed by determination of the quantum yield of PS H photochemistry (—Ñ psi —Ñ by using in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence techniques (Saijo et aL, "Over-Expression of a Single Ca2+-Dependent Protein Kinase Confers Both Cold and Salt/Drought Tolerance on Rice Plants/9 Plant J.9 23:319-327 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). —Ñ psi is a measure of the pbotosyn&amp;etic performance of the plantunder ambient light conditios. After the first cycle of 100 b of drought stress, the quautum yield of PS II photochemistry inKTS plants decreased by ¬´68%, whereas the activity of the two best-perfbiming transgenic lines (R80 and A05) only decreased by 29-37% compared with the nonstressed -controls (Figure 3 Q. Similarly, drought-induced decreases in the fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm, which is a measure of accumulated photo-oxidatrve damaged PS % woe considerably smaBer in the<br><br>
transgenic lines than in the NTS plants (Figure 3 D). In other independent experiments, similarresults were obtained for both low-temperature stress (Figure 7) and salt stress, indicating the common role that maintenance of photosynthetic capacity plays in tolerance to thesestresaes.<br>
Example 14- Transgenic Rice Plants Have Increased Capacity Under<br>
Nonstress Conditions<br>
[0075]	Improved photosynthesis under abiotic stress conditions is known to<br>
limit photo-oxidatxve damage and permit continued growth(Oweas, "Processing of Excitation Energy by Anterma Pigments‚ÄùinPhotosynthesis and the Environment, Baker, e&amp;, Kluwer, Dordrecht The Netherlands, pp. 1-23 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) and is clearly suggested by the data in Figure 3. Under the same conditions, transgenic plants exhibited soluble carbohydrate levels that were ==20% higher than those of corresponding NTC plants, including subtle changes in levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose (Table 3). Both of fhese results are consistent with the suggestion that trehalose may be involved in sugar sensing and modulating carbon metabolism (Goddijn et aLs "Trehalose Metabolism in Plants/* Tr&amp;ub Plant Sti.s 4:315-319 (1999), Theveleh and Hohmacn, Trehalose Synthase: Guard to the Gate of Glycolysis in Yeast?" Trends Biochem. Sci., 30:3-10 (199S), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). The ability of trehalose to modulatephotosynthetic capacity has been demonstrated recently (Paul et al., "Enhancing Photosynthesis with Sugar Signals," Trends Plant Sci., 6:197-200 (2001), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) in transgenic tobacco plants expressing E. coli trehalose biosyntheticgenes. Plants with enhanced IPS expression exhibited a higherphotosynthesis per unit of leaf area than nontransgenic controls, whereas those over-expressing TPP showed diminished rates of photosynthesis. These data lead them to conclude that it is trehalose-6-P and not trehalose that is modulating photosynthetic capacity (Paul et aL, 'Enhancing Photosynthesis with Sugar Signals," Trends Plant Sci., 6:197-200 (2001), whkfc is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety).<br>
[0076]	Figure 5 shows the light intensity dependence of PS <br>
Reflection<br>
transport rates, as determined by  measurements {Saijo et aL, "Over-Expression of<br><br>
a Single Ca2+-Dependent Protein Kinase Confers Both Cold and Salt/Drought Tolerance on Rice Plants," Plant J. 23319-327 (2000), which is hereby incoiporated by reference in its entirety) for nontransgenic rice and transgenic lines R80 and A05 measured under control (nonstress) conditions. Although the differences in photosynthesis are small at limiting li^ht intensities, at light saturation, the rates of photosynthesis in the transgenicplants are 5-15% higher than in the NTCs. At light saturation, photosynthetic rate is limited by the capacity of the daik reactions, in particular, the Calvin cycle and triose phosphate utilization in the cytoplasm (Owens, "Processing of Excitation Energy by Antenna Pigments," in Photosynthesis and the Environment, Baker, ed., Khiwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp. 1-23 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Together with the observed higher levels of soluble carbohydrate under both stress and nonstress conditions (Table 3), the elevated levels of light-saturated photosynthesis in the transgenic plants supports the suggestion that in plants, trehalose a<br>
and, thus, the expression of genes associated with carbon metabolism (Paul et al., "Enhancing Photosynthesis with Sugar Signals" Trends Pima Scu9 6:197-200 (2001), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The presence of a higher capacity for photosynthesis before stress provides a larger sink for the products of photosynthesis during stress, thus limiting the extent of excess-light-induced photooxidatxve damage and accounting, in part, for the more vigorous growth of the transgenic lines during stress. Interestingly, the higher efficiency of trehalose synthesis by the TPSP fusion gene product (Seo et al., "Characterization of i Bifunctional Enzyme Fusion of Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthetase and Trehalose^ Phosphate Phosphatase of Escherichia coli? AppL Environ. Microbiol, 66*2484-2490 (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) would suggest that trehalose, rather than trehalose-6-P is leading the enhanced capacity for photosynthesis.<br>
Example 15 - Productioii of Transgenic Wheat Plants<br>
[0077]	Immature embryos were isolated from greenhouse-grown wheat<br>
(Triticum aestiwm L.) cv. Bob White spring wheat variety and precultured-for 1-4<br><br>
days in the dark on modified MS medium before bombardment, as reported by Weeks et aLs "Rapid Production of Multiple Independent lines of Fertile Transgenic Wheat (Triticum aestivum), Plant Physiol 102:1077-1084 (1993), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Preparation of gold particles and coating with plasmid DNA was carried out based on the mainrfacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Osmotic treatment of target tissue before and after bombardment was performed. Bombarded tissue was placed on the same culture medium supplemented with 5 mg l"1 bialaphos (a gift from Dr. H. Anzai, Medji Seika Kaisha, Japan) for 4 weeks at 25¬∞C in the dark Bialaphos-resistant caffi were transferred to regeneration medium (MS medium containing 2% sucrose, 0*15 mg l"1 thidiazuron and 1 mg 1"J bialaphos) for 2-3 weeks at 25¬∞C under a 16 h photoperiod (66 mol m-2 s-1). After -2 weeks, regenerated shoots were transferred to Magenta9 boxes (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) containing rooting medium (half-strength MS medium and 2 mg l1 bialaphos) for 2-4 weeks at 25¬∞C under the above light conditions.<br>
[0078]	Plantlets were transferred from rooting medium to greenhouse potting<br>
mix (Sunshine mix number 1; Fison's, Canada) and were covered with beakers for the first few days after transplantation to prevent desiccation. Greenhouse day/night temperatures were 25+2/19¬∞C under a 16 h photoperiod wife supplemental lights to provide 150 junol m s light intensity. Herbicide resistance of primary transfonnants and progeny was tested by a leaf painting assay and/or spraying with a 1000-fold dilution of the commercial herbicide Glufosinate 200‚Ñ¢ (AgrEvo, NJ, USA) containing 20% ammonium glufosinate.<br>
Example 16- Detecting the Presence of SB109-TPSP and Bar Genes in Transformed Wheat Plants<br>

pSB 109-TPSP (that contains ABA stress-inducible promoter driving TPSP fusion gene) were successfully regenerated, Gne-monfiwrtd plants that were transferal to pots in the greenhouse were tested for phosphmofhricixhbased herbicide-resistance by painting the leaves using 05% Basta‚Ñ¢-(Hoedist-Roussd:( Agri-Vet Company, Somervflle, NJ). The leaves remained green in 57% transgenic plants and showed<br><br>
Basta-heihicide resistance, but in sensitive and non-transgenic control plants the leaves tamed yellow. Integration of TPSP gene was confirmed by PCR analysis. Two sets of primers were designed from the TPSP gene (TPS1/TPS2, TPP1/TPP2) for PCR analysis of the genomic DNA. Out of the 20 plant DNA samples analyzed using either of the primer pahs, 9 plants showed the expected PCR product, confirming the presence of the transgene. Interestingly, most of the primary transfonnants appears to be phenotypically normal, unlike the other reports in dicots where multiple pheaotypic alterations/pleiotropic effects were observed when trehalose gene(s) were expressed constitutively. This may be because of the regulated expression of trehalose biosynthetic gene in wheat<br>
Example 17- Transgenic Wheat Plants are Salt-Stress Tolerant<br>
[0080]	Transgenic plants that harbor die TPSP gene were analyzed for salt<br>
tolerance. Leaf segments of 0.5 cm long were cut from transgenic and non-transgenic<br>
plants and floated on different solutions of NaCl (200, 400, and 800 mM) with the<br>
upper surface of the discs in contact with the solution and kept under continuous<br>
white light for 72 hours. The leaf segments were then rinsed with distilled water and<br>
extracted with DMF (N¬ª N'-dimethyl formamide) by grinding with 1 ml of DMF with<br>
a pestle and mortar. The homogenate and washing solution (1 ml) with the solvent<br>
were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellet was then vortexed with 05<br>
ml of solvent and the pooled supernatants were adjusted to a final volume of 3 mL<br>
Ihe absorption (A) of die leaf extract at 664 nm and 647 nm was measured with a<br>
spectrophotometer. Chl-a, Chl-b, and Chl-a+Chl-b concentrations (pg/ml) were<br>
calculated by the following equations: Chl-a -12.00 A-664 minus 3.11 A*647, Chl4)<br>
- 20.78 A-664 minus 438 A-647, andCfcl-a + Oil* ¬´17.67 A-647 + 7.12 A-664.<br>
[0081]	Ihe results showed that leaf segments from the plants expressing the<br>
TPSP gene showed tolerance to NaCl with little or no significant bleadung, whereas that from the wild type showed extensive bleaching. Next, chlorophyll was isolated from control samples without-salt treatment and samples after 72 hours of NaCl treatment Chlorophyll content in plants in the absence of salt treatment was determined and set at 100. TTie results showed dwtmnon4ransgmic control i^airis,<br><br>
the chlorophyll content was decreased by ^^proximately 15% at 400 mM salt, and approximately 25% at 800 mM Nad In contrast, in the case oitransgenic lines, after salt stress the chlorophyll content was almost as high as that without salt stress.<br>
Example 18- Transgenic Wheat Plants are Water-Stress Tolerant<br>
[00S2J	A test for water-stress tolerance was earned out by measuring the<br>
electrolyte conductivity of fixe solution after soaking the leaf samples. Leaf segments<br>
were excised from plants. Duplicate samples (5 mg each) from each of two nan*<br>
transgenic plants and each of four transgenic plants woe excised from the plants. The<br>
leaf samples wore placed on dry filter paper in 9-cm diameter Petri dishes and allowed<br>
to dry inside of a Laminar Flow Hood. Six bonis later, the samples were transferred<br>
to different test-tubes that contained 2 ml distilled water. The test-tubes wore<br>
subjected to vacuum three times at five-minute intervals at 60 psi to remove air<br>
bubbles adhered to the surface of leaves. The tubes then were shaken at 300 rpm for 2<br>
hours in a slanted position After shaking, the conductivity of the solution was<br>
measured using a conductivity meter (VWR International, West Chester, PA).<br>
[0083J	These results showed that the electrical conductivity of-solutions used<br>
to soak leaves from non-transgenic plants was 5,4 leaf, whereas that from<br>
different transgenic lines was between 3,100 and 3,700 o/mg leaf These results<br>
indicated that leaves from transgenic plants are less damaged by drying. In other<br>
words, leaves from transgenic plants are more tolerant to water stress.<br>
