				<td>Process for preparing a stabilized polyester<br>
The present invention discloses a process for the preparation of a stabilized polyester that is<br>
low in	of aldehydes which comprises reacting one or more diacids with one or<br>
more diols in an esterification process, and/or one or more diesters with one or more diols in a transesterification process in the presence of an effective amount of a stabilizer selected /from the group consisting o1 (a) a polyhydric alcohol; (b) a phosphinic acid; (c) a stericaliy hindered amine; or (d) a polyacrylamide. Such polyesters, for example PET, when extrusion compounded exhibit a lower residual acetaldehyde content than does PET alone when simi¬larly treated. The invention pertains to any polyester used in the manufacture of bottles or containers which in turn are used to store consumer materials, especially food, pharmaceuti¬cals, beverages and most especially water.<br>
A low amount of contaminants (e.g. aldehydes) in polyester water bottles is beneficial for im¬proved taste or flavor in bottled water or other bottled beverages in said containers. The re¬duction in the amount of acetaldehyde in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly benefi¬cial in this respect. Acetaldehyde is known as a decomposition product of polyesters such as PET. The acetaldehyde imparts an undesirable taste or flavor to bottled water stored in poly¬ethylene terephthalate bottles. It has been a long sought objective of the industry to reduce the level of acetaldehyde which migrates out of the PET bottle walls into the water or other beverage stored therein. A number of engineering or design changes to extruders, injection molding machines for preforms and bottle making machinery have been made to minimize formation of acetaldehyde when PET is processed. Modification to the PET composition itself have been made to lower its melting point or its melt viscosity in order to allow less severe thermal or mechanical damage when PET is processed into preforms or bottles.<br>
U.S. 5,235,027 teaches the preparation of a modified copolyethylene terephthalate for pro¬cessing by extrusion blow molding with a low acetaldehyde content in the presence of a tri¬or tetrahydroxyalkane.<br>
WO-A-00/73379 discloses a process for preparing a stabilized polyester that is low in the generation ot aldehydes by reacting one or more diacids with one or more diois in an este¬rification process, and/or one or more diesters with one or more diols in a transesterification process, and adding a phosphorus-containing stabilizer to a polyester between the end of<br><br>
the melt phase and prior to subsequent secondary melting of the polyester in processing to the final article such as a bottle, characterized in that the stabilizer comprises one or more tri(phenyl) phosphites, wherein each phenyl group independently contains at least one sub¬stituted ortho position and, optionally mixed with one or more phenolic antioxidants.<br>
These known processes for preparing polyesters do not satisfy in every respect the high re¬quirements which a polyester is required to meet, especially with regard to aldehyde content of the polyester after extrusion to an end-use article like a bottle for mineral water, color pro¬perties and transparency. As a result there continues to be a need for an improved process for the preparation of polyesters.<br>
The instant invention pertains therefore to a a process for the preparation of a stabilized polyester that is low in the generation of aldehydes which comprises reacting one or more diacids with one or more diols in an esterification process, and/or one or more diesters with one or more diols in a transesterification process in the presence of an effective amount of a stabilizer selected from the group consisting of<br>

Most preferably, the diol is ethylene glycol or 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to the diacids mentioned above, various diesters may be used. For example, diesters that correspond in respect of their acid moiety to the aforementioned diacids may be used. Suitable diesters therefore also include the aliphatic and the aromatic kind. Very suitable diesters are for example the CrC4alkyl esters of terephthalic acid, iso-phthalic acid, o-phthalic acid or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably, the esterification and transesterification processes are carried out in the pre¬sence of a catalyst.<br>
Catalysts of interest for the esterification process are for example antimony or germanium compounds, e.g. antimony(lll)oxide (Sb203) or germanium dioxide (Ge02). Of interest are also titanium catalysts as disclosed for example in DE-A-19 513 056 or titanium based catalysts in combination with cobalt and phosphorous based compounds as disclosed for example in DE-A-19 518 943.<br>
Catalysts of interest for the transesterification process are for example titanium compounds, e.g. titanium(IV)butoxide.<br>
The catalysts are preferably used in the preparation of polyesters in an amount of 0.005 to 0.035 % by weight of the total amount of reactants.<br><br>
Polyesters may be produced in a conventional batch process, wherein the product of the transesterification or esterification is formed in one vessel and then transferred to a second vessel for polymerization. The second vessel is agitated and the polymerization reaction is continued until the power used by the agitator reaches a level indicating that the polyester melt has achieved the desired intrinsic viscosity and therefore, the desired molecular weight. For example, in the preparation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the esterification or transesterification is typically conducted at an elevated temperature between for example 200 to 350°C to produce a polyester having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.3 to 0.8 dl/g, commonly about 0.6 to 0.75 dl/g (determined by ASTM D-4603-86 at 30°C in a mixture of 60 % by weight of phenol and 40 % by weight of tetrachloroethane).<br>
Alternatively, these steps may also be carried out in a continuous process. For example, the continuous process disclosed in WO-A-97/44376 is conducted by combining the diol with the diacid or diester at a temperature of about 240 to 290°C and at a pressure of from about 30 to 600 kPa for about 1 to 5 hours to yield low molecular weight oligomers and water. In ge¬neral, a continuous feed of reactants is used employing a molar ratio of diol to diacid or di¬ester of from about 1.0 to 1.6. The water or alcohol so produced is removed as the reaction proceeds.<br>
In the second stage of the continuous process, which is a polycondensation stage generally conducted in a series of 2 or more vessels, the oligomers are agitated at a temperature of about 240 to 305°C for about 1 to 4 hours in the presence of a polymerization catalyst to form the polyester melt.<br>
Typically, the polycondensation reaction begins in a first vessel operated at a pressure range of from about 0 to 10 kPa. Diol produced in the polycondensation is removed from the poly¬ester melt using an applied vacuum. The polyester melt is typically agitated to allow the diol to escape from the polyester melt.<br>
As the polyester melt is fed into successive vessels, the molecular weight and thus the intrin¬sic viscosity of the polyester melt increases. The temperature of each vessel is generally increased and the pressure decreased to allow greater polymerization in each successive vessel. The final vessel is generally operated at a pressure of from about 0 to 5.5 kPa. Each of the polymerization vessels communicates with a flash vessel. The retention time in the<br><br>
polymerization vessels and the feed ratio of the reactants into the continuous process are determined in part based on the target molecular weight of the polyester.<br>
The polymerization catalyst employed in the continuous process is generally added prior to, at the start of, or during the polymerization stage.<br>
When the polymerization process is completed, the resulting polyester, which is still in the form of a melt, is generally filtered and the typically extruded and pelletized before being worked up into specific polyester articles or injection molded in a preform or coating into an item such as a bottle. Such steps are also typically labeled as "polyester processing" but refer of course to later working of the finished polyester rather than to the chemical pro¬cessing steps used to form the polyester in the first place.<br>
For example, polyester melt may be extruded into polyester sheets, filaments, pellets, chips or similar particles (so-called primary extrusion step). Preferably, the polyester melt is ex¬truded shortly or immediately after exiting the polycondensation stage, whereupon it is quenched, for example in a water trough or alternative cooling unit. The formation of pellets or chips is particularly convenient for storage, transport and handling purposes.<br>
The pellets of chips may be subjected to solid state polymerization (SSP), for example, to raise the intrinsic viscosity to 0.7 to 1.2 dl/g, preferably to about 0.83 dl/g.<br>
In order to produce the final polyester articles, in the form of bottles, filaments, sheets, mol¬ded articles and the like, the pellets or chips are re-melted and re-extruded or injection mol¬ded. The extrusion and injection molding conditions are conventional. For example, the poly¬ester may be extruded at a temperature in the range of 240 to 315°C<br>

The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Analytical procedures:<br>
Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.): 1 g of polymer is dissolved in 100 g of a 1:1 mixture of phenol and dichlorobenzene. The viscosity of this solution is measured at 30°C in an Ubelode-Viscosi-meter and recalculated to the instrinsic viscosity.<br><br>
"9'n Acetaldehvde Analysis: The concentration of acetaldehyde in PET is quantitatively deter¬mined using a thermal desorption GC-MS method adapted from B. Nijassen et al., Pack¬aging Technology and Science, 9, 175 (1996); S. Yong Lee, SPE ANTEC 1997, pp 857-861; and M. Dong et al., J. Chromatographic Science, 18, 242 (1980). A general example follows below:<br>
The PET samples are analyzed, in duplicate, by weighing 250 mg of powdered PET pellets (cryogenically pulverized) in a 5 ml crimp sealed headspace vial. The sample vial is heated at 120°C for one hour in a Tekmar model 5000 static headspace analyzer. The headspace gas (5 cc) is then transferred via a heated transfer line to a Fisons MD-800 GC-MS system for SIR detection of the acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde is detected by monitoring its frag¬ment ions of 29 and 44 m/e. The Total Ion Current (TIC) of the GC-MS is also monitored in the retention time region of 4-8 minutes. The presence of acetaldehyde in the samples is confirmed by three different detectors. By using a known acetaldehyde value for PET, the ration of peak areas for the known PET resin and for the experimental PET resins are com¬pared and the amount of acetaldehyde in the experimental PET can be obtained. Alternative¬ly a commercially available standard of acetaldehyde in water (approx. 1 ppm) may be used to establish calibration of the GC-MS.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
1621.3 g of ethylene glycol, 3338.5 g of terephthalic acid, 66.8 g of isophthalic acid, 1.36 g of antimony trioxide are mixed within a metal container with a stabilizer in an amount as indicated in Table 1. The mixture is transferred into a 10 liter reactor (stainless steel) fitted with stirrer, refluxing unit and an outlet-die at the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is pressurized with nitrogen up to 6 bars. The monomer mixture is heated from room tempera¬ture to 250°C within 30 minutes. A water/ethylene glycol mixture is distilled off for 3.5 hours. The temperature is increased consecutively to 280°C. Within the next 5 hours the pressure is continuously reduced to further distill off water and ethylene glycol. Then polyester product is extruded through the bottom die, cooled to room temperature in a water bath and pelle-tized to yield clear polyethylene terephthalate (PET) granules. From these granules the acetaldehyde content in ppm [Total Ion Current method (TIC)] and the Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) in dl/g was measured. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>

The polycondensation in the melt as described above is followed by a solid state polycon-densation (SSP) for further increasing the molecular weight by monitoring the instrinsic vis¬cosity. Furthermore, this process decreases the content of acetaldehyde.<br>
The following description illustrates the general technical procedure: 2.5 kg of polyethylene terephthalate according to Examples 1 a is placed at room temperature into a vacuum tumb¬ling dryer. During continuous tumbling of the polyethylene terephthalate under a vacuum of 0.06 mbar the following temperature protocol is followed: a) 1 hour at 120°C, b) 1 hour at 160°C, c) 1 hour at 190°C, and d) 5 hours at 220°C. The obtained product revealed an intrin¬sic viscosity value of 0.82 dl/g and a content of acetaldehyde of 0.85 ppm. Additionally all polyethylene terephthalate samples according to Examples 1b - 1q were treated similar un¬der solid state polycondensation condition. The target intrinsic viscosity value of 0.80 +/-0.02 is achieved by adjusting the solid state polycondensation processing conditions like for example time and temperature. The content of acetaldehyde after solid state polyconden¬sation of Examples 1 b -1 q is proven to be below 1 ppm in all samples.<br>
Examples 1a, 1b, 1d, 11, 1o and 1q which were treated under solid state polycondensation condition were additionally melt extruded in a Leistritz 18 mm co-rotating, intermeshing twin screw extruder at a temperature range of 280 - 284°C. From these extruded polyethylene terephthalate samples the content of acetaldehyde is measured. The results which are sum¬marized in the last column of Table 1 clearly reveal that a significant reduction of the rebuil¬ding of acetaldehyde during extrusion is observed in Examples 1b, 1d, 11, 1o and 1q accor¬ding to the invention which contain a stabilizer in comparison to Example 1a which does not contain a stabilizer.<br><br><br><br>
