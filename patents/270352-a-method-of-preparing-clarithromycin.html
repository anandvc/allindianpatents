1.  ' A METHOD OF PREPARING CLARITHROMYCIN '<br><br>

1.  (A)  Zhejiang Huayi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.<br>
    (B)  CHINESE<br>
    (C)  No.15 Shuangfeng Rd., Yinan industrial Park, Yiwu, 322002,China.<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
	The present application claims the benefit of Chinese Patent Application No. 200910098150.x, filed on April 30, 2009, which is hereby incorproated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of Technology<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of preparing an organic compound, specifically a method of preparing clarithromycin.<br>
Background<br>
Clarithromycin (structural formula I), also known as methyl-erythromycin, is a macrolide antibiotic obtained from methylation of 6-position hydroxyl group of erythromycin. It exhibits excellent anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, mycoplasma and chlamydia. Its activity is 2-4 times stronger than erythromycin. However, its toxicity is only about half (½) to one twentyfourth (1/24) of the toxicity of erythromycin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(I)<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,331,803 discloses a method of making clarithromycin by protecting the hydroxyl group at 2’-position and the dimethylamine group at 3’-position of erythromycin A, conudcting methylation of 6-position hydroxyl group of erythromycin A, and removing the protective groups from erythromycin. Because the hydroxyl group at the 11, 12, and 4’ positions of erythromycin A can be easily methylated in a methylation reaction, many by-products are produced. It makes purification of the product difficult and affects the quality and the yield of the product.<br>
In order to effectively methylate hydroxyl groups at the 6-positions, EP0272110 discloses a method of preparing clarithromycin. First, erythromycin A 9-oxime is etherified with an acid catalysis to protect the hydroxyl group at the 9-position. Next, the hydroxyl groups at the 2’-position and 4’’-position are silylanized to be protected. Then, the hydroxymethylation reaction is conducted at the 6-positions. Finally, hydrolyzation is conducted to remove the protecting groups at the 2’-position, the 4’’-position and the 9-position to obtain clarithromycin. This technological route is long and the yield is not high. Morever, because macrolide antibiotic is not stable to acid, when an acid catalysis is used to protect the hydroxyl group at the 9-position, erythromycin A 9-oxime is easily destroyed, thereby the yield is reduced. The total yield is about 50% (according to erythromycin A 9-oxime).<br>
Summary of The Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a synthesis method of clarithromycin which has a simple process, a high yield, low cost, less pollution, high quality and is suitable for the commercial manufacturing. To solve the technical problems mentioned above, the present invention adopts the following technical solution:<br>
Erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt (formula II) is etherified directly, then sequentially goes through the silanization, methylation and hydrolysis reactions. The reaction route is as follows:<br><br>
        (II)                                (III)<br>
                     (I)<br>
(IV)<br>
wherein: R1 is the protective group of the etherification reaction and R1 can be 1-ethoxy-1-methylethyl, 1-methoxyl-1-methylethyl, 2-ethoxypropyl or 1-ethoxycyclohexyl, etc.; R2 is trimethylchlorosilane.<br>
The present invention comprises the following steps:<br>
1. Erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt is dissolved in an oganic solvent. An etherifying agent is added until the reaction completes. Then, a silanizing agent is added into the reaction and erythromycin A 9-oxime silanization derivatives (III) are obtained. The oganic solvent herein can be haloalkanes, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methylbenzene, C6 to C10 lower paraffin hydrocarbon, ethyl acetate, acetone,etc., preferably dichloromethane. The etherifying agent can be 2-ethoxypropene, 2-methoxypropene, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, 1,1-dimethoxy-Cyclohexane, preferably 2-ethoxypropene. The temperature of the etherification can be -20°C to 80°C, preferably the room temperature. The dosage of the etherifying agent is equivalent to 1-20 times of erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt, preferably 6 times. The silanizing agent can be trimethylchlorosilane, hexamethyldisilazane, preferably trimethylchlorosilane. The dosage of the silanizing agent is equivalent to 1-2 times of erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt. The temperature of the silanization can be -10°C to 50°C, preferably the room temperature.<br>
2. The next step is to methylate the silanization derivatives from the previous step. After the reaction completes, water is added to obtain methide (IV). The methylating agent can be halomethane, the dosage of which is equivalent to 1-5 times of silanization derivatives. The alkali can be selected from sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, the dosage of which is equivalent to 1-5 times of silanization derivatives. The methylation solvent can adopt the mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and tetrahydrofuran. The reaction temperature is -10 to 30oC.<br>
3. Hydrolysis reaction of the methide from the last step removes the protective groups and obtain clarithromycin (I). Ethanol can be the solvent of the hydrolysis reaction. Formic acid and sodium bisulfite can be used as a reductant in a reflux reaction.<br>
Erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt used as the starting material of the present invention can be prepared in an usual processes (such as J.Antibio.1991,44(3), 313-330).<br>
Comparing the prior technology adopting erythromycin A 9-oxime in the etherification, the present invention uses erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt to achieve the etherification. The present invention has following advantages:<br>
1. The present invention leaves out a reaction step of the transformation from erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt to erythromycin A 9-oxime, which simplifies the production process. In addition, there is no need to conduct the unit operations, such as neutralization reaction of alkali, extraction, water-washing, centrifugal and drying and so on.<br>
2. In the present invention, reducing the reaction step saves the materials required for the step (usually dichloromethane, ammonia and methanol), thereby the cost of final product clarithromycin can be reduced.<br>
3. Because of reducing the one reaction step and centrifugal process, the exhaust and the pollution are decreased. <br>
4. There is no need to add acid catalyst in the etherification. Therefore, the etherification reaction is stable and the acidity destruction is avoided. <br>
5. The present invetion uses erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate as the raw material to operate etherification directly, then sequentially performs silicon alkylation, methylation and hydrolysis reactions to obtain clarithromycin. Compared with the method of using erythromycin A 9-oxime as the raw material, the yield of the preesnt invention is higher. The total yield is above 60% (accounting in erythromycin A 9-oxime thiocyanate salt), and the product quality of the present invention is better.<br>
