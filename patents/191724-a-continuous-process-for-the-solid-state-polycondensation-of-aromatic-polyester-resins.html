continuous The   present   invention   relates   to   a/process   for   the   solid<br>
state  polycondensation  of  polyester  resins.<br>
The aromatic polyester resins, particularly three of them, the polyethyleneterephthalate (PET)  the copolymers of the terephthalic acid with minor proportions of isophthalic acid and polybuthyleneterephthalate find wide application both in  the  fibres  and  the  films  area,   or  as  molding  material.<br>
While for fibres and films the intrinsic viscosity of the resin is in general between 0.6-0.75 dl/g, for the molding material are necessary higher values, which with difficulty are directly obtainable by the polycondensation process of the  resin.<br>
The  intrinsic  viscosity  is  increased  to  the  required  values (in  general  higher  than  0.75  dl/g)  by means  of  SSP processes of  the  resin,   at  a  temperature  in  general  between  190°  and 230°C.<br>
The starting resin used for the SSP process is in the amor¬phous state; it is necessary to take it to a sufficient de¬gree of crystallinity before it is submitted to the SSP pro¬cess.<br>
The crystallisation is necessary in order to avoid polymer chips stocking in the polycondensation reactor that is in general feigned by a vertical moving bed where the polymer filled from the top is passed through by an inert gas stream which removes the volatile residual products of the polycon¬densation  reaction   (ethylene  glycol  and  acetaldehyde  in  the<br><br>
case  or  poiyetnyienecerepntnaiace; .<br>
The products removal of the polycondensation reaction is a fundamental requisite for the development of the same re¬action.<br>
Various reactions occur during the polycondensation. The main reaction, that leads to the increase of the PET mole¬cular  weight  is  the  removal  of  ethylene  glycol:<br>
PET - COO - CH2 - CH2 - OH+HO - CH2 - CH2 - OCO - PET<br>
PET - COO - CHj - CH2 - OOC - PET+HO - CHj - CHj - OH<br>
Other reactions lead to the esterifications of carboxylic end-groups  and  to  the  formation  of  acetaldehyde.<br>
The polycondensation and esterification reactions are rever¬sible while the reactions leading to the acetaldehyde for¬mation  are   irreversible  and  of  various  type.<br>
They include the degradation reaction of the polymeric chain with the formation of a vinylester end-group, which reacting with an OH end-group eliminates acetaldehyde; the reaction of the vinylester group with a COOH end group with formation of an anhydride group and acetaldehyde removal; the degrada¬tion reaction of hydroxyethylic end groups with acetaldehyde formation.<br>
The acetaldehyde removal from the polymer at levels lower than few ppm is a fundamental requisite in the case of PET for the production of items for food uses, such as mineral water  bottles.<br><br>
As already indicated, the residual products of the from  the  crystallisation  stage.<br>
The polycondensation reaction is in general carried out in a tubular reactor with moving bed, wherein the polymer enters from the top and comes out from the bottom and an inert  gas   stream  is  passed  over  the  polymer.<br>
In US patent No. 4 064 122 there are described process of this type, where the granular polymer is crystallized up to a degree of density of at least 1.3 90 g/cm’, operating in crystallizers with forced movement at a temperature between 220° and 260°C and effecting then the polycondensation re¬action in a reactor with moving bed, operating at tempera¬tures equal or lower than those used in the crystallization step. The temperature in the crystallization step is in general between 23 0° and 24 5°C and the process is carried out till to obtain crystallinity values corresponding to 1.403-1.415 g/cm’ density. A temperature between 230° and 245°C is used in the polycondensation step to obtain an optimal value of the reaction speed combined with a low degree of polymer degradation. An inert gas, preferably nitrogen, is used to remove the residual products formed in the polycondensation stage. The gas is recycled after by¬products  purification.<br>
The polymer undergoes hydrolysis decompositions when the water  content  exceeds  that  one  above  indicated.<br>
The reaction speed is influenced negatively, when the glycol content  exceeds   the  above  indicated  one.<br><br>
High contents of oxygen and acetaldehyde cause discoloring in the shaped article and high contents of acetaldehyde are not  allowed  in  the  shaped  articles  for  food  use.<br>
To limit the purification costs of the gas recycling and the energy costs for the maintenance of the gaseous flow, the ration by weight between the gas rate of flow per hour and the rate of flow per hour of the polymer leaving the reactor has to be maintained between 0.7:1 and 3:1 preferably between  1:1  and  2:1.<br>
By using values  lower  than  0.7   (0.5  and  0.3  in  the  examples) and  operating  in  the  conditions  set  forth  in  US  patent  No. 4   064   112  patent   (crystallization  temperature  235°C  and  po¬lycondensation   temperature   230°C)   the   intrinsic   viscosity of  the  polymer  does  not  increase  significantly.<br>
By using ratios lower than 0.7, there is an increase of the temperature  difference  through  the  reactor  section.<br>
US patent No. 4 161 578, describes a solid state crystalli-zation/polycondensation process where the polymer in chips is crystallized in an equipment with forced movement, acting at temperatures between 180° and 235°C till to obtain a crystallinity degree corresponding to at least 1.385 g/cm’ of density and subsequently fed to a polycondensation moving bed reactor, where the polymer is heated to temperatures higher  than  those  used  in  the  crystallization  step.<br>
Nitrogen is circulated in the polycondensation reactor in countercurrent with the polymer feed with a ratio by weight between  the  rates  of  flow  comprised  from  0.7  to  3.5  kg  Nj/kg<br>
PET.<br><br>
It has been unexpectedly found that even using ratios R bet¬ween the rate of flow per hour by weight of inert gas fed to the polycondensation reactor and the rate of flow per hour by weight of the polymer coming out of the reactor lower than those considered till now as limit values, below which interesting results could not be obtained, it is pos¬sible to effectively remove the by-products of the polycon¬densation  reaction,   thus  obtaining  high  reaction  kinetics.<br>
It has furthermore been unexpectedly found that the exother¬mic heat of the reaction decreases using low R ratios; this allows to better control the thermal profile in the SSP reactor  and  to  improve  also  the  plant  operability.<br>
The usable R ratio is lower than 0.6 and preferably com¬prised  between  0.2   and  0.5.<br>
The use of such low ratios allows considerable energy sav¬ings   in  the  gas  blowing  operation.<br>
In the invention process the polycondensation reaction is carried out at temperatures between about 190° and 23 0°C, preferably  between  210°   and  220°C.<br>
The polymer to subject to the SSP reaction has a crystalli-nity degree comprised in general between 4 0 and 50% by weight  and  it  is  fed  as  chips.<br>
Preferably, the crystalline organization of the polymer is such that the pre-melting peak appearing in the DSC curve is shifted toward temperatures higher than those used in the reaction.<br>
Results  of   this   type  are  obtainable  by  operating,   for  ex-<br><br>
ample, according to the crystallization process described in the Applicant's Italian application No. MI94A002355 whose description  is  herewith  incorporated  by  reference.<br>
In the process described in the application, the chips of the amorphous polymer are at first submitted to a crystalli¬zation process carried out in a fluidized bed and then to crystallization processes in two mechanical mixers, the first working at a temperature between 10° and 30°C higher than that of the fluidized bed and the second one at a tem¬perature  corresponding  to that  used  in the next  SSP  reactor.<br>
The inert gas stream coming out from the SSP reactor is sub¬mitted to purification processes for the removal of the or¬ganic  products  impurities  therein  present.<br>
The process is described in W095/02446 application whose description  is  herewith  incorporated  by  reference.<br>
The average residence times in the SSP reactor are such as to obtain an increase of the polymer intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.1 dl/g; they are in general comprised between 5 and  20   hours.<br>
The kinetics of the intrinsic viscosity increase can be considerably increased if the polymer is blended in the mol¬ten state, in a step previous to that of crystallization, with a polyfunctional compound containing two or more groups capable of reacting with condensation or addition reaction with  the  OH  and  COOH  end  groups  of  the  polyester.<br>
The pyromellitic anhydride, and in general the dianhydrides of tetracarboxylic aromatic or aliphatic acids are examples of  such  compounds.<br><br>
These compounds are used in a quantity comprised in general between  0.1  and  2%  by  weight  on  the  polymer.<br>
The pyromellitic anhydride is the preferred compound. The use of these compounds is described in the European patent 422 282 and in US patents No. 5 243 020, 5 334 669 and 5 338 8 08 whose description is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
The polyester resins used in the crystallization process of the invention comprise the polycondensation products of C1-C20 diols such as ethylene glycol butylene glycol, 1,4 cy-clohexandimethyol with aromatic bicarboxylic acids, such as terephthalic acid, 2,6 naphthalene bicarboxylic acid or their reactive derivatives such as the lower alkyl esters such  as   for  example,   diethyl  terephthalate.<br>
Polyethyleneterephthalate  is  the  preferred  resin.<br>
Besides the terephthalic units also units deriving from other bicarboxylic acids such as the isophthalic acid and the naphthalendicarboxylic acids can be present in a quan¬tity  of  about   0.5-20%  by  weight.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a continuous process for the solid state polycondensation of aromatic polyester resins such as herein described, where the resin is fed from the top of a moving bed reactor and discharged from bottom; an inert gas is circulated counter-or equicurrent with the resin and the temperature in the reactor is kept between 180° and 230°C, with resin average residence times enough to obtain an increase of polymer intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.1 dl/g, characterized by the fact that the ratio R by weight between the gas rate of flow per hour and the rate of flow per hour of the polymer discharged from reactor is lower than 0.6.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate but not to limit the invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A polycondensation test in the solid state was carried out in a continuous reactor with moving bed and with a rate of flow of solid of 50 kg/h.<br>
The used resin is a copolyethyleneterephthalate containing a percentage by weight of isophthalic acid of 2.2%.<br><br>
The starting intrinsic viscosity was 0.60 dl/g and the ace-taldehyde  content  of  35  ppm,<br>
A polymer with a final intrinsic viscosity of 0.80 dl/g was produced keeping constant the average temperature of the re¬actor and changing only the inert gas quantity fed (nitro¬gen)    (changing  therefore  the  R  ratio).<br>
The  average  residence  time  was  12  hours.<br>
The fed nitrogen contained less than 10 ppm of organic compounds  expressed  as  methane  equivalent.<br>
The  obtained  results  are  shown  in  Table  1.<br>
Example  2<br>
By using the same reactor, the same polymer and the same inert gas, as in example 1, some tests were carried out using different temperatures of inert gas. The obtained results  are  shown  in  Table  2.<br>
Comparative  Example  1<br>
The test of example 1 was repeated using an R ratio of 1, keeping constant the average chips temperature at 210.1°C and  the  residence  time  at  12h.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the obtained polymer was of 0.80 dl/g.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
