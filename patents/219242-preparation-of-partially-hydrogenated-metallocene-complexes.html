Preparation of partially hydrogenated rac-ansa-metallocene complexes<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic ansa-metaliocene complexes, to the complexes themselves and derivatives thereof and to their use as catalysts or as a constituent of catalysts for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds or as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis.<br>
Apart from stereospecific olefin polymerization, enantioselective organic synthesis is increasingly offering interesting possible uses for chiral metallocene complexes of metals of transition groups III - VI of the Period Table of the Elements. The applications mentioned generally require the use of a metallocene complex in its racemic form, i.e. without meso compounds. In the case of the diastereomer mixture (rac and meso form) usually obtained in metallocene syntheses of the prior art, the meso form has to be separated off. There have therefore been attempts in the past to develop racemoselective syntheses of ansa-metallocenes, and corresponding synthetic routes of a general nature are described, for example, in WO 99/15538 and in DE 10030638. The racemoselective synthesis of ansa-metallocenes proceeds via the intermediate of an ansa-metallocene bisphenoxide or an ansa-metallocene biphenoxide.<br>
Hydrogenated metallocenes such as ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride and di-methylsilanediylbis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride are known from J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1996), 118, 2105, J. Mol. Katal. A. Chem. (1995), 102, 59, EPA 0643079 and JPA 07292019. They are suitable for the preparation of polyolefins such as isotactic polypropylene, copolymers and elastomers. In addition, a series of further, hydrogenated metallocenes are also known, cf. EPA 0581754, JPA 07041521. Hydrogentated and partically hydrogenated metallocenes have likewise been described as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of olefins, cf., for example, EPA 0344887, EPA 0185918 and EPA 0537686. Hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated metallocenes have a different three-dimensional structure and different polymerization properties compared to their unsaturated analogues, and this altered structure and properties leads to advantageous effects and possible uses in particular applications.<br>
In the prior art, the preparation of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated ansa-metallocenes, in particular those having partially hydrogenated indenyl systems as ligands, is usually carried out via preparation of the bisindenyl-zirconocene dichlorides, their isolation and subsequent hydro-genation, followed by isolation of the hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated product by crystallization (cf., for example, EP 839 822 and references cited therein). This synthetic route has a number of disadvantages:<br>
The synthesis of the ansa-metallocene dichloride complexes is normally carried out via the general route using zirconium tetrachloride as metal source: here, the ansa-ligand is dissolved in tolu-<br><br>
ene, deprotonated by means of strong bases and then reacted with zirconium tetrachloride to give the corresponding ansa-metallocene dichloride (plus two equivalents of lithium chloride). The ansa-metallocene dichloride, which mostly precipitates during its formation, is separated off from the lithium chloride by known methods and the complex is, if appropriate, purified further by crystallization.<br>
This "classical" reaction route has two significant problems. Apart from the desired racemate, virtually equivalent quantities of the mirror-symmetric meso diastereomer are formed in most cases. In addition, the yields of rac/meso mixture achieved using this strategy are relatively low (in the order of from about 30 to 40%). However, when the ansa-metallocene dichlorides are to be employed as catalysts for the polymerization of substituted olefins, only the racemates can be used (as mentioned above). In terms of the ansa-metallocene dichloride synthesis, this requires an often laborious and disadvantageous rac/meso separation or even destruction of the meso complex. As a result of this, the final yield of pure rac-ansa-metallocene dichloride is usually not more than 15-20%.<br>
Further disadvantages are associated with the efficiency of the synthesis. As described above, the ansa-metallocene dichloride has to be separated from the lithium chloride which is formed simultaneously. This step is often relatively difficult, since the separation of the sparingly soluble (particularly in toluene) ansa-metallocene dichloride from the likewise virtually insoluble (in toluene) lithium chloride requires large amounts of solvent and therefore limits the productivity and sfficiency of the synthetic route.<br>
Furthermore, owing to the low solubility of the ansa-metallocene dichloride in hydrocarbon solvents, the concentrations of the complex in the hydrogenation reaction of this complex are relatively low in most cases. This also restricts the productivity and efficiency of the overall synthetic Foute.<br>
For this reason, partially hydrogenated ansa-metallocenes have hitherto only been obtainable if Dften considerable losses in yield and uneconomical synthesis conditions are accepted.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art and provide a simple and cost-effective but at the same time highly effective process for preparing hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated, racemic metallocene complexes which are virtually free of meso isomer (NMR measurement accuracy). A particular object of the present invention is to find a race--noselective synthetic route to hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated metallocene compters which leads in a simple and inexpensive manner to end products which can be isolated in Dure form. A further object is to find hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic metallocene complexes which can either be used directly as catalysts, primarily for olefin polymerization, or be jsed after modification, for example after substitution of an "auxiliary ligand", as or in catalysts,<br><br>
primarily for olefin polymerization, or which can be used as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process defined in the claims, the resulting hy-drogenated or partially hyrogenated, racemic metaliocene complexes (VI) and their use as catalysts or in catalysts for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds or as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis.<br>
The terms "meso form", "racemate" and thus also "enantiomers" in the context of metaliocene<br>
complexes are known and defined, for example, in Rheingold et al., Organometallics 11 (1992), p.<br>
1869-1876.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "virtually meso-free" means that more than<br>
80%, preferably at least 90%, of a compound are present in the form of the racemate, particularly<br>
preferably at least 95%.<br>
In the present context, the term "hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated" means that at least one pair or a plurality of pairs of the unsaturated carbon atoms, i.e. sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, present in the ligand system prior to the hydrogenation step are hydrogenated, i.e., are present after the hydrogenation in hydrogen-saturated form, namely as sp3-hybridized carbon atoms.<br>
The process of the present invention for preparing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic ansa-metallocene complexes comprises the following seps: reacting bridged or unbridged transition metal-aromatic complexes of the formula I<br><br><br>
n	is an integer from 1 to 4 and corresponds to the valence of M minus 2,<br>
R1 to R8       are identical or different and are each hydrogen, halogen, C1-C2o-alkyll 3- to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alkyl group as substituent, Cer-C-is-aryl, alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, where adjacent radicals from R2 to R7 may also form saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated cyclic groups having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, Si(R9)3, -OR10, -SR10, -N(R10)2, -P(R10)2, and all the abovementioned radicals may be fully or partially substituted by<br><br><br><br><br><br>
and the substituents and indices have the following meanings:<br>
R13, R13',      R14, R14' are identical or different and are each hydrogen, halogen, C1-C20-alkyl, 3-to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alkyl group as substitu-ent, C6-C15-aryl, alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, -OR10, -SR10, -N(R10)2, -P(R10)2 or Si(R9)3,<br>
Z	is a -[Q(R15)(R16)]q- group, where<br>
Q	may be identical or different and are each silicon, germanium, tin or carbon,<br>
R15, R16       are each hydrogen, C1-C10-alkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl or C6-Ci5-aryl, and<br>
q	is 1,2, 3 or 4;<br>
R17-R20,        R17,-R20' are identical or different and are each hydrogen, C1-C20alkyl, 3-to 8-<br>
membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alkyl group as substituent, C6-C-is-aryl or arylalkyl, where adjacent radicals may together form cyclic groups having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, or Si(R11)3, and<br>
M2	is an alkali metal ion or alkaline earth methal ion, and<br>
p	is 1 when M2 is an alkaline earth metal ion and is 2 when M2 is an alkali metal ion;<br>
and heating the resulting reacton mixture to a temperature in the range from minus 78Â°C to 250Â°C, with or without addition of free radicals or free radical formers, to give a complex of the formula III<br><br><br>
It has surprisingly been found that the racemoselective synthesis of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated metallocene complexes can be achieved successfully when transition metal complexes of the formula I are prepared, preferably without isolation of intermediates, from corresponding bridged biphenoxide-type or unbridged bisphenoxide-type ligands by reaction with transition metal halides in a manner known per se, these complexes are reacted with cyclopentadie-nyl derivatives of the formula II to give biphenoxide- or bisphenoxide-substituted metallocenes having aromatic bisindenyl ligands, or heteroatom-containing analogues thereof, of the formula III which are subsequently catalytically hydrogenated in the reaction mixture. It has been found that this reaction route leads racemoselectively and in high yields to the corresponding hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic biphenoxide- or bisphenoxide-substituted ansa-metallocenes. In this way, a yield-reducing, complicated diastereomer separation is avoided.<br>
The hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic biphenoxide- or bisphenoxide-substituted ansa-metallocenes can be used as catalysts either directly or after conversion into the corresponding partially hydrogenated ansa-metallocene dichloride complexes by replacement of the phenoxide ligands. Since the biphenoxide- or bisphenoxide-substituted ansa-metallocenes are, in contrast to the corresponding hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated ansa-metallocene dichloride complexes, relatively readily soluble in organic solvents, separating them from LiCI or other salts or the hydrogenation catalyst is considerably simpler. Furthermore, the synthesis can be carried out in highly concentrated solutions, which further improves the economics of this reaction route.<br><br><br>
M	is titanium, zirconium, hafnium, in particular zirconium; and<br>
X	are identical or different and are each fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, preferably<br>
chlorine, or C1-C6-alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, i-butyl, preferably tert-butyl, or alkoxide -OR9 or amide -N(R9)2 where R9 are identical or different and are each preferably C1-C10-alky!, C6-C15-aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, fluo-roalkyl orfluoroaryl each having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl radical, for example methyl, ethyl, i-propyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, naphthyl, p-tolyl, benzyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluorphenyl.<br><br>
v The substituents R1 to R8 are identical or different and are each preferably hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, C1-C20-alkyl, -OR10, -SR10, -N(R10)2, -P(R10)2 or Si(R9)3, where R9 and R10 are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C6-C15-aryl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, alkylaryl.<br>
Furthermore, the substituents R1 to R8 may each be 3- to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a CrCio-alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl or propyl as substituent Examples of such cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, preferably cyclohexyl, norbornyl. In particular embodiments, R1 to R8 may also be C6-C15-aryl such as phenyl or naphthyl or alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. p-tolyl; arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, e.g. benzyl, neophyl; or triorganosilyl such as Si(R9)3) where R9 are identical or different and are each CrC2cralkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, C6-C15-aryi, for example trimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl. The radicals mentioned can of course also be partially or fully substituted by heteroatoms, for example by S-, N-, 0- or halogen-containing structural elements. Examples of such substituted radicals R1 to R8 are the trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluo-ropropyl, heptafluoroisopropyl and pentafluorophenyl groups.<br>
Preferred substituents R1 and R8 for bridging Y and R1, R', R" and R8 for nonbridging Y are, independently of one another, C1-C10-alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, i-butyl, tert-butyl, preferably simply methyl. Particular preference is given to all substituents R1, R', R" and R8 for nonbridging Y being identical and each being methyl and the substituents R1 and R8 in the case of bridging Y being identical and each being tert-butyl groups.<br>
In preferred embodiments, R1, R', R" and R8 for nonbridging Y are all methyl, particulary preferably with Y1 being -0-, i.e. 2 molecules of 2,6-dimethylphenol are used as ligands in formula (IV). In addition, the use of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol is also preferred according to the present invention.<br>
The substituents R3 and R6 can be varied within a wide range to alter the solubility of the metal-locene complexes (III) and (VI) resulting from the process of the present invention and, according to the present invention, are identical or different and are each hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, preferably chlorine, alkoxide -OR10, thiolate -SR10, amine -N(R10)2, -P(R10)2 or Si(R9)3, where R9 and R10 are identical or different and are each C1-C10-alkyl, C3-C10-cycloalkyl, in particular 3- to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl or propyl as substituent. Examples of such cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, preferably cyclohexyl, norbornyl. Furthermore, R9 and R10 may also be halogen-substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl radicals, for example trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, heptafluoro-propyl or heptafluoroisopropyl.<br><br>
A person skilled in the art will choose alkyl, cycloalkyl or aromatic substituents R3 and R6 to increase the solubility of the metallocene complexes in nonpolar solvents and will choose polar substituents R3 and R6, for example halogen, alkoxide, thiolate, amine and the like, to reduce the solubility of the complexes in nonpolar solvents.<br>
In the latter case, R3 and R6 are preferably halogens such as chlorine or bromine, alkoxides -OR10, thiolates -SR10 or amines -N(R10)2l where R10 is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl.<br>
Very particular preference is given to R10 being methyl. R3 and R6 in formula (I) are particularly preferably chlorine, bromine, methoxy, ethoxy, isopropyloxy, tert-butyloxy, cyclopropyloxy or cy-clohexyloxy.<br>
Variation of the substituents R3 and R6 over a wide range does not have an adverse effect on the racemoselectivity of the synthesis, so that appropriate choice of the substituents, taking account of the chosen reaction conditions, enables the yield of the synthesis to be increased and improved in a targeted manner.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, phenoxides, biphenoxides or bisphenoxides (or their analogous derivatives) are all compounds of the formula IV and their analogous derivatives claimed according to the present invention, i.e. both those particular compounds and ligands having this basic structure and other elements or groups as defined for Y1 in place of the phenol oxygen in the position Y1.<br>
Apart from the abovementioned bridges Y and Y1, preferred bridges in particular embodiments of the invention are methylene -CH2-, -S-, -0-, -C(CH3)2-; very particular preference is given to the bridges Y1 being identical and each being oxygen -0-. Furthermore, particular preference is given to biphenoxides in which m is zero and both Y1 are oxygen.<br>
When Y is nonbridging and represents two radicals R' and RM, these are preferably defined as for R1 to R8, including the radicals indicated as preferred there. Furthermore, R', R" together with adjacent radicals R4, R5 can form saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated cyclic groups having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms.<br>
Suitable deprotonating agents for the deprotonation of (IV) are, for example, n-butyllithium, tert-butyllithium, sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide, Grignard reagents derived from magnesium, magnesium compounds such as di-n-butylmagnesium, (n,s)-dibutylmagnesium or other suitable alkyl compounds of alkaline earth metals or alkali metals.<br><br>
The bridged or unbridged transition metal complexes of the formula (I) are subsequently reacted with cyclopentadienyl derivatives of the formula (II):<br><br>
where the substituents and indices are as defined above, using methods which are generally known to those skilled in the art.<br>
As cyclopentadienyl derivatives of the formula (II), preference is given to using those in which<br><br>
and in which M2 is an alkali metal ion or an alkaline earth metal ion, in particular Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba, where p = 1 in the case of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and p = 2 in the case of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, with the radicals R17 to R20 and R17 to R20' being as defined above.<br><br>
A well suited procedure has been found to be the following, which is generally carried out in the temperature range from -78 to 110Â°C, preferably initially at about 20Â°C, and in which the reaction may, if necessary, be completed by boiling under reflux.<br>
The compounds of the formula (IV) are firstly deprotonated in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, for example toluene or tetrahydrofuran (THF), by means of, for example, sodium hydride or n-butyllithium and the transition metal compound, for example the halide such as titanium tetrachloride, zirconium tetrachloride or hafnium tetrachloride, is subsequently added, advantageously in the form of the bis-THF adduct or the DME adduct of the formula (V). As an alternative, the deprotonated compound of the formula (IV) can be added to a solution of the transition metal compound. After the reaction is complete, the product (I) can generally be obtained by crystallization after salts have been separated off. However, preference is given to using the reaction mixture which has been freed of salts for the further procedure without isolation of (I).<br>
The bridged or unbridged transition metal complexes (I) generally still contain from 1 to 4 equivalents of the Lewis base which is generally introduced via the synthetic route. Examples of such Lewis bases are ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) and also amines such as TMEDA. However, it is also possible to obtain the transition metal complexes (II) free of Lewis bases, for example by drying under reduced pressure or by choosing other solvents in the synthesis. Such measures are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The transition metal complexes of the formula (I) are reacted as described above with cyclopen-tadienyl derivatives of the formula (II), with or without subsequent heating of the reaction mixture obtained and in the presence or absence of free radicals or free radical formers, as described below.<br>
Preference is given to using transition metal complexes (I) in which M is zirconium and the radicals R1 to R8 have the above-described preferred meanings and in which Y1 are each oxygen. Very well suited complexes are dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethylphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethyl-4-chlorophenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethyl-4-bromophenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethyl-4-methoxyphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethyl-4-ethoxyphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,6-dimethyl-4-tert-butoxyphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenoxide), dichiorozirconium bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxide), dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-3,3'-dimethoxy-l.l'-bi-2-phenoxide, dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyI-5,5'-diethoxy-1,1'-bi-2-phenoxide, dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-3,3'-dipropyloxy-l.l'-bi^-phenoxide, dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-3,3'-dimethylthio-l.l'-bi2-phenoxide, dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-3,3'-diethylthio-l.l'-bisphenoxide, dichiorozirconium 3,3'-di-tert-butyl-3,3'-dipropylthio-l.l'-bi-2-phenoxide, their solvent adducts and the zirconium bisphenoxide and zirconium biphenoxide compounds mentioned in the examples.<br><br>
The reaction according to the present invention of compounds of the formula (I) with cyclopenta-dienyl derivatives of the formula (II) in the process of the present invention leads initially in a known manner to the transition metal complexes of the formula (III)<br><br>
where all substituents are as defined above, including the preferred substituents.<br>
In a further process step, the complexes of the formula (III) are at least partially hydrogenated in the presence of a suitable catalyst to give hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic ansa-metallocene complexes of the formula (VI):<br><br><br><br>
where:<br>
R13, R13',      R14, R14' are identical or different and are each hydrogen, halogen,C1-C20-alkyl, 3-to 8-membered cycloalkyl which may in turn bear a C1-C10-alky! group as substitu-ent, C6-C15-aryl, alkylaryl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, arylalkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the aryl part, -OR10, -SR10, -N(R10)2, -P(R10)2 or Si(R9)3, and<br>
Z	is a -[Q(R15)(R16)]q- group, where<br><br><br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out in the presence of a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst, preferably a heterogeneous catalyst Suitable catalysts are Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Os and also nik-kel, Raney nickel, their oxides, salts or complexes, mixtures thereof, if desired on suitable catalyst supports. Particular preference is given to carrying out the hydrogenation in the presence of heterogeneous palladium catalysts, in particular palladium on carbon or activated carbon.<br>
Further examples of hydrogenation catalysts which are suitable for the purposes of the present invention are palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on aluminum oxide, palladium black, palladium sponge, platinum oxide, platinum black, platinum sponge, platinum dioxide, etc.<br><br>
Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are in principle those compounds or elements which do not hy-drogenate or only partly hydrogenate the solvent under the hydrogenation conditions employed.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is preferably carried out in the temperature range from 0Â°C to 150Â°C, in particular in the range from 15Â°C to 100Â°C. The solvents used in the reaction are suitable hy-drogenation-stable solvents, particularly preferably halogen-free solvents. Solvents which are suitable for this purpose are aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene (as an isomer mixture), o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, mesitylene, tetralin, anisole, cumene, 1,2-diethylbenzene, 1,3-diethylbenzene, 1,4-diethylbenzene, 1-ethyl-2-methyIbenzene, 1-ethyl-3-methylbenzene, 1-ethyl-4-methylbenzene. Preference is given to anisole, toluene, benzene, xylenes (as a mixture or pure substances) and tetralin.<br>
Further suitable solvents are aromatic or aliphatic ethers such as anisole, ethyl phenyl ether, iso-propyl phenyl ether, diethyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dimethoxyethane (DME). It is also possible to use esters of aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids as solvents, for example ethyl acetate and propyl butyrate.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to use halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane. However, preference is given to using nonhalogenated solvents since the use of halogenated solvents in relatively large quantities is only possible when strict safety and environmental regulations are adhered to. In addition, only hydrogenation catalysts having a low activity, e.g. platinum black or platinum dioxide, can be used in chlorinated solvents if haiogenation reactions are to be avoided. The haiogenation reactions lead to decomposition of the product and to corrosion problems in the apparatuses used.<br>
The heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation in the process of the present invention is generally carried out in appropriate pressure vessels, i.e. autoclaves, which are pressurized with hydrogen gas (H2). Suitable hydrogen pressures are in the range up to 100 bar, preferably up to 30 bar, particularly preferably up to 20 bar.<br>
The racemic metallocene complexes of the formula (VI) which have been hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated according to the present invention can be used either directly as catalysts or as constituents of catalysts for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds or as reagents or catalysts in stereoselective synthesis, or can generally be modified further.<br>
In particular, one or both of the phenoxide ligands or the single biphenoxide ligand in the complex (VI) can, for example, be replaced by substitution before further use. Suitable substitution methods are reaction of the racemic metallocene complexes of the formula (VI) with SOCI2, silicon tetrachloride, methylaluminum dichloride, dimethylaluminum chloride, aluminum trichloride, dial-kylaluminum chlorides, aluminum sesquichlorides, particularly preferably ethylaluminum dichlori-<br><br>
de, or a Br&amp;nsted acid such as hydrogen halide, i.e. HF, HBr, HI, preferably HCi, which is generally used as such or as a solution in water or an organic solvent such as diethyl ether or THF. Well-suited solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ortho-, meta- or para-xylene or isopropylbenzene (cumene), ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether or dimethoxyethane (DME), amines such as diisopropylamine, tetramethylethanediamine (TMEDA) or pyridine.<br>
Also suitable are Lewis-base-containing solvent mixtures comprising hydrocarbons and ethers or amines or both, for example mixtures of toluene and THF, toluene and DME or toluene and TMEDA, with the Lewis base generally being present in an amount of 0.01-50 mol%, preferably 0.1-10 mol%, based on the solvent mixture. Particularly useful substitution reagents are carboxy-iic acid halides such as acetyl chloride, phenylacetyl chloride, 2-thiophenacetyl chloride, trichlo-roacetyl chloride, trimethylacetyl chloride, O-acetylmandelyl chloride, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic chloride, 2,6-pyridinecarboxylic chloride, tert-butylacetyl chloride, chloroacetyl chloride, 4-chlo-rophenylacetyl chloride, dichloroacetyl chloride, 3-methoxyphenylacetyl chloride, acetyl bromide, bromoacetyl bromide, acetyl fluoride, benzoyl fluoride, with these generally being used in the abo-vementioned solvents or as such.<br><br><br><br><br>
In the substitution reactions, the components are usually used in a stoichiometric ratio, which depends on whether a monosubstituted or disubstituted product is to be obtained.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, rac-ethanediylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)2irconium dichloride is prepared in the process of the present invention by reacting a dihalozirconium bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxide) compound or a dihalozirconium bis(2,6-dimethylphenoxide) compound or a dihalozirconium bis(214-di-tert-butyiphenoxide) compound with ethane-1,2-diylbisindenyldilithium to form ethanediylbis(indenyl)zirconium bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxide) or ethanediylbis(indenyl)zirconium bis(2,4-dimethylphenoxide) or ethanediylbis(indenyl)zirconium bts(2,4-di-tert-butylphenoxide) which is subsequently hydrogenated to ethanediylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxide) or ethanediylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium bis(2,4-dimethylphenoxide) or ethanediylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenoxide), and subsequently replacing the phenoxide groups.<br>
The process of the present invention makes it possible to obtain the rac form of the metallocene complexes (III), and also the hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated complexes (VI) obtainable therefrom and the corresponding dihalides (Via) obtainable there- from and analogous compounds, very selectively.<br>
The hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated, racemic metallocene complexes (VI) and downstream compounds can be obtained selectively and in high yields by the present novel process. Furthermore, the process of the present invention makes it possible for the solubility of the resulting products to be controlled in a simple fashion by selection of suitable substituents on the phenoxide or biphenoxide ligands, which makes isolation of the products easier and increases the yields of the synthesis. The good solubility of the complexes (III) to be hydrogenated in nonpolar solvents also makes it possible to work in concentrated solutions, which significantly improves the economics and efficiency of the synthesis described compared to the processes of the prior art.<br>
A further significant advantage is that the process of the present invention can be carried out ra-cemoselectively in a single-vessel process. For the purposes of the present invention, a single-vessel process means that no intermediates are isolated after the individual process steps. The further reaction can be carried out directly using the reaction product mixture from the preceding step.<br>
The hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated racemic metallocene complexes obtained according to the present invention, in particular those of the formula (VI) or their above-described derivatives of the formula (Via) which are obtainable, for example, by replacement of the (bi)phenoxide ligands, can be used as catalysts or in catalyst systems for the polymerization of olefinically unsaturated compounds such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, styrene. They are<br><br>
particularly advantageous in the steroselective polymerization of prochiral, olcfmically unsaturated compounds such as propylene, styrene. Suitable catalysts or catalyst systems in which the racemic metallocene complexes obtainable according to the present invention can function as "mctallocenc component" are usually obtained by means of compounds which form metallocenium ions, for example as described in HP-A-0 700 935, page 7, line 34, to page 8, line 21, and the formulae (IV) and (V) therein. Further compounds capable of forming metallocenium ions are alurmnoxanes (RAIO)n such as methylalummoxane, or else boron activators.<br>
The racemic mctallocenc complexes obtained according to the present invention, in particular those of the formula (VI) or their above-described derivatives of the formula (Via) which can be obtained by, for example, replacement of the (bi)phenoxide ligands, can also be used as reagents or as catalysts or in catalyst systems in stereoselective synthesis, in particular stereoselective organic synthesis. Examples which may be mentioned arc the stereoselective reduction or stereoselective alkylation of C  C double bonds or CO- and C N double bonds.<br>
RAC used herein means racemic and ANSA mctallocenc arc mctalloccnes in which two cyclopentadienyl Hgands are connected via a bridge (ansa means handle).<br><br>
