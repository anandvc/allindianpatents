				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of embedded system and particularly to multi-functional peripheral (MFP). More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system to delete mail attachments.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The patent publication GB2377135A describes an email manager program for automatic deletion of attachments of emails using predefined rules. The predefined rules can include age of the email, the size of the email, etc. Further, the predefined rules can be customized by the user. However, the publication describes the email manager for wireless information devices like smart phones, communicators, etc.<br>
The patent publication WO2001084764A2 discloses a concept of dynamically removing attachments from received messages. However, the publication focuses on handheld computers and cell phones to describe the concept, rather than on an MFP. Moreover, the publication mentions about filtering of text and attachments, rather than permanent deletion of attachments from a mailbox.<br>
The concept of deleting attachments of received emails from the mailbox, while retaining the contents of the emails, has been disclosed in the patent publication GB2377135A. The publication also discloses the concept of allowing a user to set<br><br>
conditions for automatic deletion of attachments based on age/size of the attachments. However, the publication specifically describes the concept for wireless information devices.<br>
The patent publication WO2001084764A2 also discloses a concept of setting policies for receiving messages on handheld devices. However, the attachments are deleted from the messages before the messages are received on the devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
MFPs have mail box which stores the Mail. The Mail sometimes has attachments which uses a lot of memory. The attachments become obsolete after sometime. For E.g. the attachment of a document which has a different version of document (latest) in some other mail. In this case the older document becomes obsolete. Hence it can be deleted but the Mail contents needs to be maintained.<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a method for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox. Another object of the invention is to provide a system for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox.<br><br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	marking the attachments by a user for deletion;<br>
(b)	retaining the contents of the email to be deleted; and<br>
(c)	removing the marked attachment.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing an option of automatic deletion of emails based on user set conditions;<br>
(b)	scanning the mailbox for attachments to be removed on the set conditions when a new mail arrives and the mail box is running out of memory space;<br>
where the contents of the email to be deleted is retained.<br>
The user set conditions involves age of the email and getting a new email containing the latest version of the attachment.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox comprising:<br>
(a) means for marking the attachments by a user for deletion; and<br><br>
(b) means for removing the marked attachment retaining the contents of the email to be deleted.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox comprising:<br>
(a)	means providing an option of automatic deletion of emails based on user set conditions; and<br>
(b)	means for scanning the mailbox for attachments to be removed on the set conditions when a new mail arrives and the mail box is running out of memory space<br>
where the contents of the email to be deleted is retained.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to<br><br>
provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to the field of Multi Functional Peripherals (MFPs). More specifically, the invention proposes a method for deleting attachments in emails present in the mailbox of the MFP to free up memory space of the mailbox. According to the method, the contents of the emails are retained, while the attachments can be marked by a user for deletion. Further, the user can also be provided with an option of automatic deletion of emails based on certain conditions like age of the email, getting a new email containing the latest version of the attachment, etc.<br>
MFPs have mail box which stores the Mail. The Mail sometimes has attachments which uses a lot of memory. The attachments become obsolete after sometime. For E.g. the attachment of a document which has a different version of document(latest) in some other mail. In this case the older document becomes obsolete. Hence it can be deleted but the Mail contents needs to be maintained.<br>
MFPs have Mail Box that can store Mails and Mails with attachments. If the user feels the attachment is obsolete then he can mark for deletion of the attachment. In this case attachment is removed and space occupied by the attached is<br><br>
released  to free  memory.  Also the  user can  have  the  options set as -"automatically remove obsolete documents".<br>
When a new mail comes and the Mail Box is running out of space then the mailbox will be scanned for obsolete documents, and the older ones can be removed. Also the user has an option only to delete the attachments and maintain the Mail contents.<br>
The user can configure the MFP to do the above in a customized way.<br>
One of the ways to remove obsolete attached documents can be to check for same name of attachment and delete older one. The user can configure that this can be applied only for some particular address, or for a particular group, etc. As the conditions for obsolete attachments varies from one user to other user this is user customized.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
In addition to the advantages evident from the description above, the following additional advantages are also present:<br>
1.	Dynamic Memory allocation for reception of a new mail by clearing the obsolete attachments.<br>
2.	Memory Save.<br><br>
it will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
