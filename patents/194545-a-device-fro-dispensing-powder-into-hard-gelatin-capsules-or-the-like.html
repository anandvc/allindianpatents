				<td>Device for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like<br>
Description<br>
The invention is based on a device for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like in accordÂ¬ance with the preamble of Claim 1. A device of this kind is known from DE 23 46 070 Al. The known device has pins for altering the volume of powder compacts, which pins penetrate into bores of a metering disc which revolves in steps. With the aid of first rams of a filling disc, the powder compacts are pushed into the metering disc, and the projecting portions, corresponding to the penetration depth of the pins, of the powder compacts are sheared off when the filling disc rotates further. In order to transfer the powder compacts into the provided capsule lower parts by means of second rams, the pins are first withdrawn from the bores of the metering disc. It may happen, with certain types of powder, when using the device, which otherwise operates satisfactorily, that due to the sheared-off powder compacts, the powder in the filling disc is not of the desired homogeneity.<br>
Furthermore, a complex design and accurate production of the device are necessary, since the pins have to withdraw from and then penetrate back into the bores of the metering disc prior to each transferral of the powder compacts onto the capsule lower parts, and for operating reasons only a small gap is permissible between the pins and the bores in the metering disc.<br>
The object of the invention is to reduce the inhomogeneities of the powder in the filling disc when operating a device of the generic type and simultaneously to achieve a design of the device which is as simple as<br><br>
possible.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the characterizing features of claim 1.<br>
Further advantages and advantageous refinements of the device according to the invention for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like result from the subclaims and the description. A more simple transferral and undamaged powder compacts during pushing into the capsule lower parts are achieved due to the fact that the top sides of the sleeves end flush with the bottom of the metering disc, so that the powder compacts do not have to be pushed over a projection during transfer. Futhermore, it is particularly advantageous to provide setting means which interact with the metering disc in order to alter the volume of the compacts. In this case, irrespective of the volume set, there is no need to adjust the receiving wheel which accommodates the capsule lower parts.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like, having a metering disc which revolves in steps about a vertical axis of rotation and by means of side walls forms a storage chamber for the powder, the bottom of which metering disc has first bores which receives the powder and in which the powder is formed into compacts by means of plugging rams, having means for ejecting the compacts into capsule lower parts provided beneath the metering disc, and having means for altering the volume of the compacts, characterized in that the means for altering the volume comprise a disc-like element which revolves synchronously with the metering disc, is located between the metering disc and the provided capsule lower parts and has second bores, which are aligned with the first bores in the metering disc, in that a variable distance can be set<br><br>
between the metering disc and the element in the direction of the axis of rotation, and in that in each case one sleeve is located in the first and second bores, which are respectively aligned with respect to one another, which sleeve penetrates at least partially into the said bores and is able to bridge the distance between the first and second bores.<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is explained in more detail in the following description. Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section of a device for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like, and Figures 2 and 3 show a longitudinal section of part of the device in accordance with Figure 1 at two end positions of the spaced disc.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
The device 10 illustrated in Figure 1 for dispensing powder into hard gelatin capsules or the like has an essentially pot-shaped metering disc 11 which revolves in steps about an axis of rotation 1 and has a hub region 12 arranged in the axis of rotation 1 and a circumferential side wall 13 formed on the circumference of the metering disc 11. The open, top end side of the metering disc 11 is covered by a lid 14 which is attached to two columns 16. The columns 16 are arranged on table 17.<br><br>
which supports the device 10. A storage chamber the powder is formed by the bottom 18 of the metering disc 11, the underside of the lid 14 and the side wall 13 and the hub region 14. In order to refill the powder into the storage chamber 19, the lid 14 has a centrally arranged opening 21. A plurality of groups of first bores 22, into which the sleeves 23 are fixedly inserted, are formed in the bottom 18 of the metering disc 11, The upper end sides of the sleeves 23 end flush with the bottom 18 of the metering disc 11. The sleeves 23 project at least partially into second bores 24 of a spacer disc 27 arranged parallel to the planar underside 26 of the metering disc 11, The spacer disc 27 and the- metering disc 11 are connected to one another in a rotationally fixed manner by means of a peg 25 arranged in the bottom 18 in the region of the side wall 13. The sleeves 23 and the second bores 24 form volumes 30 which serve to form ppwder compacts (not shown) by means of plugging rams in plugging stations, which rams are known per se, are arranged in the storage chamber 19, are not shown'in the drawing and can be moved up and down.<br>
The spacer disc 27 is connected to a shaft stub 29 in a rotationally fixed manner by means of a screw connection 28. The shaft stub 29 is mounted rotatably by means of two bearing bodies 31 in a receptacle 32 formed in the table 17. At the end opposite to the spacer disc 27, the shaft stub 29 is connected to a driving wheel 33, which is coupled for example to a drive (not shown}, for example a stepper motor or servomotor.<br>
On that end side of the shaft stub 29 which is opposite to the driving wheel 33, a further bore 34, into which a cylindrical intermediate piece 35 is inserted, is formed aligned with the axis of rotation 1. The interÂ¬mediate piece 35 is fixed axially in the shaft stub 29 by means of a screw 36. The intermediate piece 35 penetrates through the spacer disc 27 and projects into a bore 37 which is formed centrally in the hub region 12 of the metering disc 11 and serves to guide the metering disc 11 axially on the intermediate piece 35.<br><br>
A hole 38, through which a setting screw 39 connected to the hub region 12 and the metering disc 11 projecta, is provided in the base of the bore 37. The setting screw 39 engages in a threaded bore 40 formed in the shaft piece 35. By means of the setting screw 39, the distance a between the underside 26 of the metering disc 11 and the top side 41 of the spacer disc 27 can be altered continuously between two limit positions. In one limit position (Figure 2), the metering disc 11 bears against the spacer disc 27, and the distance a is zero. Consequently, the volumes formed by the sleeves 23 and the second bores 24 for the compacts adopt a minimum. In the other end position (Figure 3), in which the distance a is such that the sleeves 23 project only a little way into the second bores 24, the volumes 3 0 adopt their maximum.<br>
The device 10 is completed by the plugging stations, which have already been mentioned, are not shown, are arranged in the storage chamber 19 and are connected to the columns 16, for pressing the powder into the volumes 30, a powder deflector 42 arranged in the storage chamber 19, a transfer station (likewise not shown) for transferring the formed compacts into provided capsule lower parts, and a receiving wheel 43 arranged beneath the spacer disc 27.<br>
The receiving wheel 43, the axis of rotation of which is aligned parallel with the axis of rotation 1 of the metering disc 11, has a number of capsule receptacles 44 for the capsule lower parts which corresponds to the number of the second bores 24, the capsule receptacles 44 being arranged aligned with the second bores 24. In that region of the underside 26 of the spacer disc 27 which is not covered by the receiving wheel 43, there is arranged a pressure ring 45 which serves as a mating bearing for the plugging rams, is at least congruent with the second bores 24 and is at as small a distance as possible from the spacer disc 27.<br>
The mode of operation of the device 10 is known per se, and is therefore explained only briefly: the<br><br>
metering disc 11 which rotates in a stepwise manner stops in each case in the regions of the plugging stations, where powder is pressed into the volumes 30 formed by the sleeves 23 and the second bores 24 by means of the plugging rams. This process is repeated at each of a total of, for example, four plugging stations, so that compacts made of powder are formed in the volumes 3 0, which compacts are transferred into the capsule lower parts provided in the capsule receptacles 44 of the receiving wheel 43. During the further rotation of the receiving wheel 43, the capsule lower parts are closed by the capsule upper parts in a closure station.<br>
The possible volume of the compacts, which corresponds to the size of the capsule lower parts or capsules, can be set by means of the distance a between the axially stationary metering disc 11 and the spacer disc 27, using the setting screw 39.<br><br><br>
