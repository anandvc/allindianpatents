Detailed Deseription of the Invention<br>
The common client IM software is firstly described before the solution provided by embodiments of the present invention is described. For instance. Figure 1 illustates an interface of common client IM software. The interface mainly includes a main interface and an active window. The main interface is a main display interface of the client IM software and includes one or more tabs. When a certain tab is clicked by a user via a mouse, contents of the clicked tab are displayed; while contents of the other tabs are hidden except their titles. As illustrated in Figure I, contents of tab 3 are displayed, while contents of the other tabs are hidden. Each tab corresponds to a category of chat objects; for instance, conlent.s of corresponding labs "good friend", "family", "group" and "blacklist" are lists of contact persons of corresponding categories. When a contact person {usually represented in a mode of an icon and characters) in contents of a currently di.sp!ayed tab is clicked by the user, an active window by which the user chats with the contact person is popped up. The user can input chat information in the active window and send the chat information to the<br><br>
contact person; and can also see chat information sent from the contact person via the aclive window. The user can also define new tabs by itself in oidei' to sort the contact persons more finely. Locations of the main interface and the active window shown in Figure I are merely examples, the main interface and Ihe active window may be shown at any locations of the client display interface.<br>
Current client [M software not only provides basic chat functions, bu( also provides other functions, such as file transfer, music broadcast and advertisement push, which are also realized on the basis of the interface shown in Figure I.<br>
In order to create an interface similar to that shown in Figure I on the basis of the web page, an embodiment of the present invention mainly adopts Hypertext Marker Language (HTML) and browser javascript technologies, and uses HTML div elements (i.e. divs) to simulate the tabs of the main interface and the aclive window.<br>
Div elements are elements used to provide the contents of HTML block-level with a structure and background. All the contents between the start flag <div> and end flag </div> of the Div form a corresponding tab of the main interface. Characteristics of elements contained in the div are controlled by attributes of tab divs or by formatting the HTML block-level with a style sheet. For convenience, the div used to simulate a tab is called a tab div, and the div used to simulate the aclive window is called an active window div hereinafter. The active window div provides a corresponding interface on which chat contents are input by the user or chat contents sent from other clients are displayed.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present application, a method for simulating an Instant Messaging, IM, client interface on the basis of a web page includes:<br>
simulating a tab of a main interface and an active window of client IM software with divs of Hypertext Marker Language, HTML; detecting an action of an input device; and performing operations to the tab of the main interface and / or the active window of the client IM software according to the delected action of the input device. Where a div for simulating the tab is a tab div, a div for simulating the active window is an active window div, labs of the main interface simulated by tab divs are ari'anged one by one according to a sequence, active windows simulated by active window divs are arranged to be overlapped with each other, and each active window div conesponds to a lab div.<br><br>
Picferably, the input device may be a mouse, and the action is a mouse action; or the input device may a keyboard, and the action is a keyboard action. There may be other input device besides the mouse and the keyboard. Preferably, the iequence is a sequence from the top down or from the left to the right. In the following embodiments, the mouss is taken as an example to explain the implementation of the solution of the present application.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention illustrates the switch between active windows. As shown in Figure 2, the left side shows the main interface formed by multiple tabs simulated by tab divs. Each tab corresponds lo a div layer. The tabs are arranged one by one from the top down according to a manner similar to that of the tabs in the main interface in Figure 1. The tabs can also be arranged in other manners according to the use habit of the user, such as be arranged one by one from the left to the right. The tabs include two categories. The first category includes currently displayed tabs, titles and contents of which are displayed on the main interface, Other tabs which do not belong to the first category belong to the second category, i.e. tabs which are not shown currently. Only titles of the lab.s of the second category are displayed, and their contents are hidden. The right side of Figure 2 shows the active windows formed by multiple overlapped active window divs. Each active window div may have the same size, shape and location, and correspond to a tab div respectively. If the user clicks a tab div in the main interface with the mouse, the display attribute of the active window div corresponding to the clicked tab div is set as "displayed", while the display auribuics of Llic olhci iicUvc window divs arc set as "hidden". Con.sequent]y, although the active windows are formed by multiple overlapped active window divs, only the active window div of which the display attribute is set as "displayed" can he seen, so that the switch between tab pages are realized. The process of the switch between the active windows according to this embodiment is illustrated in Figure 3, which is described below.<br>
Block 301: Mouse action is detected. If it is detected that a tab of the main interface is clicked by a key of a mouse such as a left key, Block 302 is performed; otherwise, Block 301 is performed again.<br>
Block 302: A tab div corresponding to the tab clicked by the left key of the mouse is determined. The attribute of an active window div corresponding to the tab<br><br>
div is set as "displayed", while the attributes of the other active window divs are set as •'hidden".<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, adding a tab page is realized. Because each lab conespond.s to a tab div, in order to add a lab of the main interface on the left side of Figure 2, it is only necessary to dynamically add a div layer in a div container of the original lab page by operating a DOM element with javascript and to add a corresponding div layer functioning as an active window. The process of adding the tab page according to this embodiment is illustrated in Figure 4, which is described below.<br>
Block 401: Mouse action is delected. If it is detected that a tab of the main interface is clicked by the key of a mouse such as a right key, Block 402 is performed; otherwise, Block 401 is performed again.<br>
Block 402: A menu such as a right key menu is displayed, which at least includes an option for adding a tab. If the option for adding a tab is selected by a mouse action. Block 403 is performed; otherwise, the current process is terminated.<br>
Block 403: A DOM element is operated with the javascript, a tab div is added and a corresponding div layer acting as an active window div is added.<br>
Block 404: The newly added tab div is named according to the u.ser's input.<br>
In a thirdcmbodiment of the present invention, the display and turning of a tab is realized. A model is created by a Model View Controller (MVC) technology. Each time a tab is added or removed, the lab is added into a model or removed from a model firstly, and (hen the model is drawn via a display control module. The MVC is a macroscopical design mode proposed to obtain a better system structure; the "Model" represents a mode] layer of the system, the "View" is a display layer of the model, and the "Controller" is in charge of controlling the workflow of the program. The use of the MVC can make the arrangement of the system clearer, which can reduce coupling of each part of the system.<br>
In this embodiment, the model is in the form of a queue, in which a tab may be added or removed. In order to prevent user's misoperation or resource abuse, the maximum number of the tabs may be set. Certainly, the number of the tabs may not be limited.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 5, two pointers, a View_start pointer and a View_end pointer, are used to indicate a view to he displayed in the model, i.e. elements in the view. In order to turn a page, it is merely required to make Vicwstart pointer and View_end pointer respectively point to the start and the end of display contents corresponding to a tab to be displayed, i.e. the display contents of a tab div corresponding to the tab of the main interface. Thus, in the view, the contents of the tab of the main interface are displayed under the title of the lab of the main interface, while only titles of the other tabs are displayed. Therefore, the effect of turning a tab is achieved.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present application, an apparatus for simulating an Instant Messaging, IM, client interface on the basis of a web page includes: an input device action detection module, a main interface simulation module and an active window simulation module. The input device action detection module is adapted to detect an action of an input device; the main interface simulation module is adapted to simulate a tab of a main interface of client IM software with a tab div, perform operalion.s !o the simulated tab of the main interface according to the action of the input device detected by the input device action detection moduie, where tabs of the main interface simulated by tab divs are arranged one by one according to a sequence; and the active window simulation module is adapted to simulate an active window of the client IM software with an active window div, and perforin operations 10 the .simulated active window according to the action of the input device detected by the input device action dctection module; wherein active windows simulated by active window divs arc arranged to be overlapped with each other, and each active window div corresponds to a tab div of the main interface simulation module.<br>
