THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AN IMPROVED FLUID DISPENSER DEVICE"<br>
VALOIS   S.A.,   of Boite  postale  G,   Le   Prieure,   F-27110  Le Neubourg, France,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
"The present invention relates to a fluid dispenser device, and more particularly to an improved fluid inhaler.<br>
^	In certain types of fluid dispenser device, and in<br>
particular devices of the aerosol type, including a metering valve adapted to dispense a substance contained in a reservoir by means of a propellant gas, the unit formed by the metering valve and by the reservoir is<br>
JXJ  generally assembled into a body which incorporates a<br>
mouthpiece or a nasal applicator, and which facilitates handling of the device.  In certain cases, said body may also include an inhalation-driven trigger device which co-ordinates actuation of the metering valve with<br>
LB""  inhalation of patient.  In this type of device, the problem arises of compensating for manufacturing tolerance, at the body, at the reservoir, or at the metering valve, in order to avoid poor-quality assembly which could prevent the valve from operating reliably.<br>
2v      More particularly, in a device including an inhalation-driven actuating system, the unit formed by the reservoir and by the metering valve must be assembled into the body very accurately so as to enable the inhalation-driven actuating system to co-operate reliably with the said<br>
$#"  metering valve.  One way of compensating for<br>
manufacturing tolerances is to act on the travel stroke of the valve member, but that is not acceptable when the metered quantities or "doses" to be dispensed must be accurately reproducible.  In addition, assembly in which<br>
30/" a certain amount of clearance exists between the various components can also prevent the device from operating safely and reliably, which is not acceptable.<br>
£<br>
Document US-5 904 139 discloses cone-on-cone snug interfitting between a bottom portion of the body that is provided with the mouthpiece, and the top portion of the body that contains the reservoir.  The depth of the interfitting can be varied slightly to compensate for the<br>
P-j ; <br><br><br><br>
manufacturing tolerances, deeper interfitting inducing radial forces between the two portions of the body.<br>
Document US-3 157 317 discloses a deformable elastomer element disposed between the bottom of the reservoir and the body of the inhaler so as to compensate for the manufacturing tolerances.  If that element is deformed it exerts an axial force on the reservoir and on the body. /      An object of the present invention is to provide a 10  fluid dispenser device that does not suffer from the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
An object of the present invention is thus to provide a fluid dispenser device that guarantees that the body and the dispensing member of the reservoir are assembled together accurately, independently of the manufacturing tolerances of the three elements, and without inducing compression or deformation forces between said elements.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a fluid dispenser device that is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and to assemble.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a fluid dispenser device that is actuated by KJV . inhalation and that enables the dispensing member to be 25/  separated from the inhalation-driven actuating system so as to enable said dispensing member to be actuated manually.<br>
--" The present invention therefore provides a fluid dispenser device comprising a fluid reservoir, and a dispensing member, such as a metering valve, fitted to said reservoir, said reservoir and said valve being assembled into a body incorporating a dispensing orifice, said device being characterized in that it includes an adjustment element disposed between the reservoir and the 3^5  body, said adjustment element being provided with adapter means that are movable and/or deformable and that co¬operate with the body and/or with the reservoir while the<br><br><br><br><br>
reservoir is being assembled into the body, thereby compensating for the manufacturing tolerances of said body and/or of said reservoir and/or said dispensing member.<br>
Advantageously, once the fluid dispenser device has been assembled, said adjustment element exerts substantially no force on the reservoir, on the body, and/or on the dispensing member.<br>
Advantageously, said adjustment element is provided with axial openings, and the adapter means are implemented in the form of small cylinders that can slide snugly in said openings while said reservoir is being assembled into the body.<br>
Advantageously, prior to assembly, said small cylinders are fixed to said openings by bridges of material that are deformable and/or breakable.<br>
Preferably, said adjustment element is fixed to the bottom of the reservoir and is fitted to the body while said reservoir is being assembled into said body.<br>
Advantageously, the adjustment element is fitted to the body removably.<br>
Advantageously, the adjustment element is fitted to the body by turning e.g. through one fourth of a turn.<br>
Advantageously, the device includes an inhalation driven trigger system for triggering the dispensing member, actuation of said dispensing member being separated from said inhalation-driven trigger system when said adjustment element is disassembled from said body, thereby enabling said dispensing member to be actuated manually.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will appear more clearly on reading the following detailed description given by way of non-limiting example, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br><br>
/«<br><br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a device in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, before the reservoir is assembled into the body;<br>
Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1, after the &amp;  reservoir has been assembled into the body;<br>
Figure 3 is a diagrammatic cross-section view of said device as assembled, in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 is a partially cut-away diagrammatic view of the device in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figures 5 and 6 are diagrammatic detail views of the adapter means in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, respectively before and after the 1£-" reservoir is assembled into the body; and<br>
Figure 7 is a diagrammatic view of the adjustment element in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is described below with 2"u  reference to an embodiment in which the fluid dispenser device is an inhaler having a metering valve, and generally operating in the upside-down position. However, the invention is not limited to this type of device.  Rather, it is applicable to all fluid dispenser Z^T    devices in which manufacturing tolerance problems can<br>
arise during assembly at the body, at the reservoir, or at the dispensing element.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the dispenser device includes a reservoir 10 to which a dispensing member 20, which is a metering valve in this example, is fixed by means of a fixing ring, which is a crimped cap in this example.  The resulting unit formed of the reservoir 10 and of the metering valve 20 is then assembled into a body 30 incorporating a dispensing orifice 31, which, in this example, is implemented in the form of a mouthpiece.  It should be noted that, in the example shown in Figures 1 and 2, the mouthpiece is<br>
5<br><br>
y<br>
covered with a cover, but said cover has no repercussions on the present invention.<br>
In the invention, the device includes an adjustment element 40 which is disposed between the reservoir 10 and 5/  the body 30.  For example, the adjustment element 4 0 may¬be implemented in the form of a ring which is fixed to the bottom of the reservoir 10, as shown more clearly in Figures 3, 4 and 7.  The adjustment element 40 may be fixed to the reservoir 10 in any manner, e.g. by snap-fastening or the like.<br>
The adjustment element 40 is provided with adapter means 45 which are movable and/or deformable and which co-operate with the body 30 and/or with the reservoir 10 while said reservoir 10 is being assembled into said body<br>
15.  30.  Thus, while the device is being assembled, this "   makes it possible to compensate for any manufacturing<br>
tolerance at said body, at said reservoir and/or at said dispensing member, in particular at the valve member thereof.  As shown more clearly in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, said adapter means may be implemented in the form of small cylinders 45 which can slide snugly inside respective openings 42 disposed axially inside the adjustment element 40.  With reference to Figure 5, which shows the reservoir 10 prior to being finally assembled into the body 30, the adjustment element 40 is pre-positioned on and, in this example, fixed to the reservoir 10, and the small cylinders 45 are not urged by said reservoir into said respective openings 42.  While the unit formed by the body 10 and by the metering valve<br>
  20 is being assembled into the body 30, which is shown more clearly in Figures 3 and 4, an axial force in the direction indicated by the arrows shown in Figures 3 and 4 is exerted by the bottom of the reservoir 10 on said small cylinders 45.  Said cylinders then slide snugly inside said axial openings 42 until assembly is finished, thereby taking up any slack between the body 3 0 and the metering valve, between the reservoir 10 and the<br><br><br>
/<br><br>
adjustment element 40, and between the adjustment element 40 and the body 30.  Advantageously, as shown in Figure 3, the small cylinders 45 may, prior to assembly, be fixed to said openings 42 by bridges of material 43 that<br>
Jf     are deformable and/or breakable.<br>
Advantageously, as shown in Figure 1, the adjustment element 40 is fixed to the bottom of the reservoir 10 and is then fitted to the body 30 while said reservoir 10 is being assembled into the body 30.  More precisely, the<br>
L0  adjustment element may be fitted to be removable, e.g. by being turned through one fourth of a turn, as represented diagrammatically in Figure 1 by the groove 3 7 provided for this purpose inside the opening in the body 30, which groove co-operates with said adjustment element 40.  This<br>
^<br><br>
Y$      implementation is particularly advantageous in an inhaler device triggered by the user inhaling.  In which case, the device (generally referred to as a "Metered Dose Inhaler" or "MDI") includes a system for actuating the metering valve by means of the patient inhaling, which system is coupled to said metering valve.  However, it is sometimes desirable, in certain special cases, for the metering valve to be actuated manually.  This is generally not possible, or else it is very complicated without completely disassembling the device.  With the present invention, the metering valve 20 can be released from the inhalation-driven trigger system very simply merely by disassembling the adjustment element 40 from said body 30.  In which case, the bottom of the reservoir becomes accessible to the user who can then manually actuate the metering valve by exerting axial pressure on it.  The inhalation-driven trigger system is not shown in the drawings, but it is well known to the person skilled in the art that such systems, which are well known and described in the prior art, co-operate with the valve<br>
35  member of the metering valve 20.  By disassembling the /  adjustment element 40 from the body 30, it is possible to release said valve member temporarily from the<br><br><br><br>
/<br>
inhalation-driven trigger system, and thus to actuate<br>
said metering valve manually.<br>
Naturally, the invention is described above merely<br>
with reference to very diagrammatic drawings, and clearly Jb       modifications may be made to it without going beyond the<br>
ambit of the present invention as defined by the<br>
accompanying drawings.  In particular, the adapter means<br>
are not necessarily implemented in the form of small y    cylinders, and they may take any suitable form making it 10  possible to compensate axially for the manufacturing<br>
tolerances of the various elements to be assembled<br>
together in a fluid dispenser device.<br><br><br><br>
