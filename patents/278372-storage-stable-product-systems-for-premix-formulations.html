Storage-stable product systems for premix formulations<br>
The present invention relates to storage-stable product<br>
systems with high latency and good mechanical stability<br>
which are suitable, inter alia, for premix formulations. In<br>
addition, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing the formulations according to the invention, and<br>
to the use thereof.<br>
The formulation of active ingredients to give product<br>
systems which permits the delayed release of active<br>
ingredients has considerable advantages over the<br>
conventional administration of active ingredients. Thus,<br>
the dosage of the active ingredients and the site of<br>
release can be controlled and the active ingredients can be<br>
continuously released over a prolonged period.<br>
Consequently, it is often possible to achieve better<br>
utilization and a reduction in the required amount of<br>
active ingredients, which in term reduces side-effects,<br>
reduces the environmental impact and conserves natural<br>
resources.<br>
Product systems for the controlled release of sensitive<br>
active ingredients are also known from the literature.<br>
These systems are used in order to avoid undesired<br>
conversion or decomposition and to improve the storability<br>
of sensitive active ingredients. Furthermore, for some<br>
usages, for example in the area of construction chemicals<br>
or in the case of adhesives, handling advantages can be<br>
attained.<br>
In the field of pharmaceutical products, a targeted release<br>
of the active ingredients in a pregiven area of the body is<br>
often desired. Product systems have likewise been developed<br>
for these aims. Product systems with delayed active<br>
ingredient release are likewise often used in the<br>
pharmaceutical sector. Here, it is a case of administering<br>
an active ingredient as uniformly as possible over a<br>
 <br>
prolonged period or releasing the active ingredient at<br>
certain sites in the human or animal body. A comprehensive<br>
report on this can be found, for example, in "Modified-<br>
Release Drug Delivery Technology" (M.J. Rathbone,<br>
J. Hadgraft, M.S. Roberts, editors). Marcel Dekker Inc.,<br>
New York, 2003. Similar product systems have also been<br>
developed for controlled release of pesticides and other<br>
crop protection compositions. A comprehensive overview on<br>
this subject can be found in Park et al., "Controlled<br>
release of pesticides from microparticles", pages 89-136<br>
in: Controlled-Release Delivery Systems for Pesticides<br>
(H.B. Scher, editor). Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
One concept that is often used for targeted active<br>
ingredient release is based on the embedding of the active<br>
ingredient in a suitable matrix, the matrix in most cases<br>
being an organic polymer substance. The matrix can be<br>
designed such that the active ingredient passes by<br>
diffusion through the matrix or, as a result of the erosion<br>
or breakup of the matrix, slowly to its surface, where it<br>
is brought into contact with a suitable solvent. In another<br>
variant, the matrix material is designed such that a<br>
solvent diffuses through the matrix material and thus<br>
arrives at the active ingredient. Both systems have the<br>
disadvantage that the diffusion is a relatively slow<br>
process and relatively large amounts of active ingredient<br>
cannot be released all at once. Both systems are therefore<br>
suitable only for fields of use where what matters is long-<br>
lasting, uniform active ingredient release. Furthermore, in<br>
the case of such a particle structure, a considerable part<br>
of the active ingredient is located directly on the<br>
surface, which very often can lead both to the<br>
decomposition of sensitive active ingredients during<br>
storage, and also to the undesired immediate release of the<br>
active ingredient. This problem is particularly marked when<br>
the product system is synthesized in the form of<br>
microparticles having an average diameter below 200 urn.<br>
 <br>
Examples of systems with an organic matrix are the products<br>
described in WO 2004/072153 and WO 03/033027. A<br>
disadvantage here is the low stability, in particular the<br>
low pressure loadability of these systems, where this low<br>
loadability can cause problems during storage. Furthermore,<br>
the use of these products is often limited to less<br>
chemically aggressive active ingredient.<br>
Another system involves the binding of an active ingredient<br>
into a porous carrier material, e.g. an inorganic oxide, -<br>
and closing parts of the pores by a protection system. This<br>
leads to only some of the pores being accessible for a<br>
solvent and thus the active ingredient release being<br>
slowed. However, a disadvantage of this system is that the<br>
system releases the active ingredient as soon as it comes<br>
into contact with the solvent, i.e. in the case of soluble<br>
active ingredients and premix formulations with at least<br>
one corresponding solvent, such product systems are<br>
unsuitable for targeted release of the active ingredient at<br>
the site of application since the active ingredient comes<br>
into contact with the solvent during the premixing and is<br>
released.<br>
A further development of the aforementioned product system<br>
includes the complete covering of a porous carrier material<br>
containing active ingredient with a protective layer such<br>
that all of the pores are closed by the protective layer.<br>
The active ingredient release can then take place either by<br>
diffusion of the active ingredient through the protective<br>
layer, which again is a slow process and generally leads to<br>
incomplete active ingredient release. Alternatively, the<br>
active ingredient can be released in such systems following<br>
breakup of the protective layer. Since the protective layer<br>
is applied outside of the carrier material, these systems<br>
are very sensitive to mechanical stresses during<br>
production, transportation or use of the product systems.<br>
I.e. mechanical action leads to an at least partial<br>
 <br>
destruction of the protective layer, meaning that an<br>
undesired release of active ingredient is thereby<br>
triggered. Consequently, such systems can only be used in<br>
specific areas. Examples of such systems can be found inter<br>
alia in WO 02/098998, WO 00/51724, WO 2006/004481,<br>
CH 573212, EP-A-0 454 881 and CA 2 438 438.<br>
The products disclosed in the specification WO 02/098998<br>
include an inorganic matrix which are produced by a sol/gel<br>
process. In this process, firstly an active ingredient is<br>
complexed with a carrier molecule and the product obtained<br>
in this way is incorporated into a matrix which is produced<br>
by a sol/gel process. These methods are costly and complex<br>
in terms of handling, with product release taking place via<br>
the cavities produced during the formation of the matrix.<br>
As a result of this, no active release of the components is<br>
made possible, rather the substances are fixed in a matrix<br>
and released in the presence of a solvent without it being<br>
possible to control the time of release. Thus, the release<br>
of the active ingredient takes place directly by adding<br>
solvent. Release at a later time is not possible.<br>
The specification WO 2006/004481 discloses an additive for<br>
feeds which has antimicrobial properties. The additive<br>
comprises a porous carrier and also acids which have been<br>
incorporated into the carrier as active ingredients. To<br>
control the release, the system comprises a core with a<br>
strong acid and an outer layer which comprises an acid<br>
which has a higher pH than the acid in the core. Release is<br>
controlled here via a diffusion control, it being possible<br>
for the outer layer to be porous in order to permit<br>
diffusion of the acid from the core outwards.<br>
Furthermore, the document WO 00/51724 describes a system<br>
for the controlled release of active ingredients which<br>
comprises an inorganic matrix. Release of the active<br>
ingredient can be controlled by diffusion. This means that<br>
the release rate can be influenced via the pore size.<br>
 <br>
However, systems of this type cannot therefore be stored<br>
together with a liquid in which the active ingredient is<br>
soluble since the active ingredient inevitably diffuses<br>
into the solution. Although WO 00/51724 also explains the<br>
option of a controlled release of the active ingredient,<br>
with various control signals being described, a specific<br>
solution for the problem of a release controlled by an<br>
external signal is not described.<br>
Furthermore, the specification CH 573212 describes a<br>
composition which can be used in particular in agriculture.<br>
This composition comprises a porous carrier material, for<br>
example kieselguhr, an active ingredient and a protective<br>
layer, for example made of organic compounds, which brings<br>
about a delay in the active ingredient release. The<br>
protective layer here is soluble in a solvent, in<br>
particular water. Upon contact with water, the protective<br>
layer is broken up after a time determined by the<br>
solubility of the protective layer. Following the breakup<br>
of the protective layer, the active ingredient is released<br>
with diffusion control. A disadvantage of this system,<br>
however, is poor handling, which hinders processing of<br>
these systems. Upon contact with moisture, these systems<br>
often have a tendency toward aggregation, as a result of<br>
which controlled application is hindered. A mixing of this<br>
composition with further substances may also lead to<br>
problems associated with observing mixing ratios.<br>
The application EP-A-0 454 881 describes a composition<br>
which comprises a porous carrier material which is laden<br>
with an acid. Furthermore, the composition has a plurality<br>
of layers which permit controlled release of the acid,<br>
where the outermost layer can comprise compounds<br>
("anticoalescent") which can prevent agglomeration of the<br>
particles. The release of the acid can take place via<br>
various methods, each of which is associated with a breakup<br>
or,a destruction of the protective layers. A disadvantage<br>
 <br>
here is in particular the processability or handling of the<br>
particles. For example, in the event of inappropriate<br>
handling of the composition, the acids can be released<br>
undesirably. This is particularly critical for plants in<br>
which these compositions are processed since the acids can<br>
lead to corrosion of the plants. Plants made of acid-<br>
resistant materials, however, are expensive. If plants of<br>
this type are used, then the acids can also be processed<br>
directly.<br>
Document CA 2 438 438 discloses porous silicate particles<br>
which are laden with active ingredient. The particles are<br>
provided with a layer which permit controlled release of<br>
the active ingredient. The particles described in this<br>
document have the same problems which the particles<br>
according to CH 573212 and EP-A-0 454 881 also exhibit.<br>
There therefore continues to be a great need for suitable<br>
product systems which have high stability to mechanical<br>
stresses and permit rapid and as complete as possible an<br>
active ingredient release at a certain site or from a<br>
certain time. I.e. these product systems should as far as<br>
possible release no active ingredient during storage and/or<br>
during transportation to the site of action, but should<br>
release the complete active ingredient as rapidly and<br>
completely as possible at the site of action.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
produce new types of product systems which do not have, or<br>
have only to a reduced extent, the aforementioned<br>
disadvantages of the product systems of the prior art. In<br>
addition, the aim is to provide a method for producing such<br>
product systems.<br>
Further details not explicitly specified arise from the<br>
overall context of the description, examples and claims of<br>
the present invention.<br>
 <br>
Surprisingly, the aforementioned object is achieved by new<br>
types of product systems as defined and characterized in<br>
the claims of the present invention and also in the<br>
description below. These new types of product systems are<br>
characterized in that a carrier material is laden with at<br>
least one active ingredient and at least one protection<br>
system, where the protection system is arranged to the<br>
greatest possible extent in the pores of the carrier<br>
material and not on its surface. In addition, it is ensured<br>
that all or largely all of the pores of the carrier<br>
material are filled with the protection system in such a<br>
way that no solvent can come into contact with the active<br>
ingredient. In contrast to product systems in the prior<br>
art, the product systems according to the invention have<br>
the advantage that undesired active ingredient releases do<br>
not result.<br>
Moreover, the protection system of the product systems<br>
according to the invention is designed so that it can be<br>
deactivated in a targeted manner such that, spontaneously,<br>
the entire active ingredient or at least a large part of<br>
the total active ingredient -is released. The product<br>
systems according to the invention thus have very good<br>
latency. This latency can be designed such that, prior to<br>
the deactivation, approximately no or no active ingredient<br>
release can take place, but afterwards an active ingredient<br>
release can take place spontaneously.<br>
As a result of the fact that the protection system is<br>
arranged for the greatest part or completely in the pores<br>
and not as a coating around the carrier material, the<br>
product systems according to the invention are insensitive<br>
towards mechanical stresses. This means that the<br>
formulations according to the invention can be incorporated<br>
into premixes without the active ingredient being released.<br>
During the production of premixes, on the one hand<br>
mechanical forces act upon the particles (via the mixer),<br>
 <br>
but on the other hand the formulations according to the<br>
invention also come into contact with the further<br>
components of the premix formulation. The product systems<br>
according to the invention can be incorporated into such<br>
formulations without or largely without the active<br>
ingredient being released. However, as soon as a certain<br>
input of energy or a change in the chemical environment has<br>
an effect on the premix, the active ingredient is<br>
spontaneously released. Environmental influences, such as<br>
e.g. humidity, and contact with solvents do not lead to a<br>
premature active ingredient release, i.e. the product<br>
systems according to the invention exhibit very good<br>
latency. For example, active ingredients which should be .<br>
present in foods, e.g. yoghurt, but should only be released<br>
in the stomach are encapsulated with the product systems<br>
according to the invention in such a way that they<br>
withstand the incorporation into the yoghurt and the<br>
storage without the active ingredient being released. Only<br>
upon contact with the stomach acid is the active ingredient<br>
then spontaneously released. Conventional product systems<br>
with "core/shell" construction are not suitable for<br>
achieving such an object since, upon incorporating the<br>
product system into the yoghurt, i.e. the production of the<br>
premix, at least parts of the shell are destroyed by the<br>
mechanical influences, meaning that in the course of the<br>
storage of the premix, active ingredient is gradually<br>
removed from the formulation.<br>
Moreover, the method according to the invention is cost-<br>
effective and efficient since low-cost carrier materials, u<br>
such as, for example, precipitated silicas, can be laden in<br>
conventional apparatuses with the carrier material and the<br>
protection system without special apparatuses being<br>
required for this purpose. During packaging and<br>
transportation it is also possible to dispense with special<br>
measures, thus affording economic advantages.<br>
 <br>
Finally, it is possible, depending on the choice of<br>
protection system and the trigger mechanism, to satisfy any<br>
desired release scenarios in terms of time. Thus, for<br>
example a mixture of two product systems can be produced in<br>
which one part of the particles is equipped with a<br>
protection system which releases the active ingredient upon<br>
reaching a certain temperature, but the other part of the<br>
particles does not release the active ingredient at this<br>
temperature, but the active ingredient is released as a<br>
result of a change in pH. Consequently, active ingredients<br>
can also be released in a targeted manner to various sites.<br>
Finally, it is also possible to permit a delayed active<br>
ingredient release over a prolonged period, but which only<br>
starts at a very specific time, i.e. which is preceded by a<br>
latency time. In this embodiment of the present invention,<br>
e.g. the active ingredient in a matrix from which it must<br>
diffuse out could be incorporated into a carrier and<br>
additionally the pores could be provided with a protection<br>
system which only permits contact of the active ingredient<br>
with a solvent after a targeted influence.<br>
Moreover, as a result of the targeted active ingredient<br>
release of the formulations according to the invention in<br>
combination with the latency, undesired side-effects can be<br>
avoided. For example, it is possible to produce product<br>
systems according to the invention which have no kind of<br>
active ingredient on the surface and moreover permit no<br>
kind of contact between active ingredient and the<br>
environment. This is not the case for systems in the prior<br>
art with incomplete pore closure or diffusion mechanism.<br>
Consequently, the present invention provides product<br>
systems comprising<br>
at least one inorganic and/or organic porous<br>
carrier,<br>
 <br>
at least one active ingredient which is<br>
introduced into the porous carrier, and<br>
at least one further substance of the at least<br>
part of the total amount present in the product<br>
system is introduced in the pores of the carrier<br>
material,<br>
which are characterized in that, detected by investigating<br>
the outermost atomic layer of the product system by means<br>
of XPS, at least part of the outermost surface of the<br>
product system is formed by the carrier material.<br>
Also provided are product systems comprising<br>
at least one inorganic and/or organic porous<br>
carrier,<br>
at least one active ingredient which is introduced<br>
into the porous carrier, and<br>
at least one further substance of the at least<br>
part of the total amount present in the product<br>
system is incorporated in the pores of the carrier<br>
material,<br>
characterized in that these further substance and/or<br>
substances forms/form a protection system for the active<br>
ingredient/active ingredients which is designed such that,<br>
through a deactivation of the protection system as a result<br>
of an input of energy and/or chemical conversion and/or<br>
breakup of the protection system, the protection system is<br>
changed in such a way that, preferably spontaneously, at<br>
least 50% by weight of the active ingredient/active<br>
ingredients is/are released.<br>
Likewise provided by the present invention is a method for<br>
producing a product system according to the invention,<br>
 <br>
characterized in that an active ingredient is introduced<br>
into a porous carrier and a protection system is produced.<br>
Finally, the present invention provides the use of the<br>
particulate composition according to the invention for<br>
producing foods, feeds, medicaments, products for the land<br>
and forestry, cosmetics, components for coating<br>
formulations and adhesive formulations or components for<br>
sports equipment and sports clothing, and also said<br>
articles per se.<br>
The subjects of the present invention are described below<br>
in detail. The terms used in the description, the drawings,<br>
the claims and the abstract of the present invention are<br>
defined as follows:<br>
Within the context of the present invention, particulate or<br>
particle refers to a three-dimensional body made of at<br>
least one inorganic and/or organic material with a defined<br>
outer shape which - depending on the size of the particle -<br>
can be ascertained by means of microscopic methods (light<br>
microscope, electron microscope etc.). The particles<br>
according to the invention may be porous, i.e. have pores<br>
and/or internal cavities.<br>
The product system according to the invention comprises<br>
at least one inorganic and/or organic porous<br>
carrier,<br>
at least one active ingredient which is introduced<br>
into the porous carrier, and<br>
at least one further substance of the at least<br>
part of the total amount present in the product<br>
system is introduced in the pores of the carrier<br>
material,<br>
 <br>
characterized in that, detected by investigating the<br>
outermost atomic layer of the product system by means of<br>
XPS, at least part of the outermost surface of the product<br>
system is formed by the carrier material.<br>
It is essential that the largest possible part of the outer<br>
surface of the product system according to the invention is<br>
formed by the carrier material. In contrast to systems in<br>
the prior art, in the case of the systems according to the<br>
invention, the largest part of the total amount of active<br>
ingredient(s) and protective substance(es) is located in<br>
the pores of the carrier. Consequently, the protection<br>
system cannot be damaged by mechanical influences as is the<br>
case with systems in the prior art in which the pores are<br>
filled completely, i.e. to the maximum absorption capacity,<br>
with active ingredient, and the protective substance forms<br>
an independent shell, as in the case of an onion skin,<br>
around the carrier filled with active ingredient.<br>
The carrier materials according to the invention are '<br>
generally stable upon mechanical stresses such as<br>
transportation and filling. As a result, the carrier<br>
material protects the active ingredient/protective<br>
substance system embedded therein. In the case of the<br>
systems in the prior art, upon destruction of the outer<br>
protective substance shell, the pores, which are filled up<br>
to the edge with active ingredient, are exposed and the<br>
active ingredient can escape, i.e. a targeted release of<br>
active ingredient is no longer possible.<br>
The product systems according to the invention are thus<br>
characterized in that their outer surface is formed at<br>
least partly by the carrier material. Preferably, at least<br>
10%, particularly preferably at least 15%, very<br>
particularly preferably at least 20%, of the outer surface<br>
of the product systems according to the invention,<br>
according to measurement of the outermost atomic layer by<br>
means of XPS, is formed by the carrier material and not by<br>
 <br>
the molecules of active ingredient/active ingredients<br>
and/or protective substance/protective substances.<br>
For specific applications, it is also advantageous that the<br>
outer surface of the product systems according to the<br>
invention is free from active ingredient(s) so that these<br>
active ingredient fractions do not trigger any premature<br>
undesired reaction. In one particular embodiment of the<br>
present invention, according to measurement of the<br>
outermost atomic layer by means of XPS, no active<br>
ingredient is located on the outer surface of the product<br>
systems according to the invention, or at most 10%,<br>
preferably at most 5%, particularly preferably at most 1%,<br>
of the outer surface is covered by active ingredient.<br>
The product system comprises at least one organic and/or<br>
inorganic, preferably porous carrier material with active<br>
ingredient(s) adsorbed or absorbed therein. The carrier<br>
material per se is preferably insoluble or only slightly<br>
soluble in water. It can, for example, be selected from the<br>
group which consists of preferably precipitated, porous<br>
carrier oxides of aluminum and/or of silicon and<br>
phosphorus-containing substances, preference being given to<br>
using silicas, silica gels, fumed silicas, aluminum oxides,<br>
clays, sheet silicates, zeolites, diatomaceous earths, and<br>
mixed oxides. They are particularly preferably precipitated<br>
silicas or silica gels in the form of powders, granules or<br>
microgranules having an average diameter d50 greater than<br>
or equal to 3 µm. Particular preference is given to the<br>
commercially available carrier silicas from Evonik Degussa<br>
GmbH, e.g. Sipernat® 2200, Sipernat® 22, Sipernat® 50,<br>
MagSilica, from Rhodia Chimie, e.g. Tixosil 38X or Tixosil<br>
68 or PPG, e.g. HiSil SC 72 or HiSil SC 60. Comparable<br>
carrier silicas from other companies, however, are likewise<br>
suitable.<br>
The unladen inorganic and/or organic porous carrier<br>
material preferably have a DBP absorption (according to<br>
 <br>
DIN 53601) of at least 180 g/100 g. The pores accessible<br>
for DBP are also accessible for the active ingredient and<br>
the substances of the protection system, and a high DBP is<br>
therefore important in order to achieve a high loading of<br>
the pores of the carrier with active ingredient and<br>
protective substance. Consequently, too low a DBP<br>
absorption may, depending on the active ingredient, be<br>
ineffective since too much carrier material has to be used.<br>
The DBP absorption of the carrier material is preferably in<br>
the range from 180 to 600 g/(100 g), particularly<br>
preferably from 180 to 500 g/(100 g), very particularly<br>
preferably from 200 to 500 g / (100 g) and especially<br>
preferably from 240 to 500 g / (100 g), very particularly<br>
preferably 240 to 400 g / (100 g) and specifically<br>
preferably 240 to 350 g / (100 g).<br>
Furthermore, it has proven to be advantageous if the<br>
carrier material and preferably also the entire product<br>
system are particulate. The particles of the carrier<br>
material and/or of the product system particularly<br>
advantageously have an average particle size d50 in the<br>
range from 5 µm to 5000 µm, preferably 5 urn to 1000 µm,<br>
particularly preferably from 5 to 500 µm, very particularly<br>
preferably from 5 to 150µm and especially preferably from<br>
10 to 100 µm. If the particles are too small, then<br>
undesired dust formation may result. In addition, if the<br>
outer surface compared to the inner surface is so large<br>
that it becomes difficult or even impossible to prevent the<br>
active ingredient being absorbed on the outer surface.<br>
Excessively large particles in turn have the disadvantage<br>
that they are often mechanically unstable and are<br>
unsuitable for further processing. They are furthermore<br>
often incompatible with the end formulation and have pores<br>
which are too deep, meaning that the absorption and<br>
desorption rates can be too slow and/or parts of the<br>
absorbed active ingredient can no longer be desorbed.<br>
 <br>
It has proven to be advantageous if the weight ratio of<br>
protective substance to active ingredient is in the range<br>
from 10:1 to 1:10. The ideal ratio depends on the chemical<br>
nature and the physiochemical properties of the active<br>
ingredient and of the carrier material and also of the<br>
protection system and can be determined for any material<br>
combination by simple experimental series. Higher loading<br>
of the carrier material can lead to protective substance no<br>
longer being able to be introduced to an adequate extent<br>
into the pores, meaning that the latency is no longer<br>
ensured. Too little loading is not economically sensible.<br>
Particularly preferably, the weight ratio of protection<br>
system to active ingredient is in the range from 10:1 to<br>
1:10, very particularly preferably in the range from 5:1 to<br>
1:5 and especially preferably in the range from 2:1 to 1:3.<br>
Besides the weight ratio, it may be advantageous, depending<br>
on the material combination, to observe a certain ratio of<br>
DBP absorption and absorbed amount of active ingredient.<br>
Without being bound to one specific theory, the inventors<br>
are of the view that DBP, the active ingredients to be<br>
absorbed and the protective substances often have a similar<br>
space requirement in the pores of the carrier material and<br>
also penetrate into similarly sized pores. Consequently,<br>
this ratio gives information about how much space is still<br>
present in the pores accessible for the protective<br>
substance and can thus ensure that an adequate amount of<br>
active ingredient and also protective substance can be<br>
introduced into the pores. It has thus proven to be<br>
advantageous that the loading of the porous carrier with<br>
active ingredient is at least 10% by weight to 90% by<br>
weight, preferably 10% by weight to 80% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably 20% to 70% by weight and very<br>
particularly preferably 30% to 60% toy weight, based on the<br>
DBP absorption of the porous carrier. In one specific<br>
embodiment, the loading of the porous carrier with active<br>
 <br>
ingredient is 1% by weight to 9% by weight, based on the<br>
DBF absorption of the porous carrier.<br>
As already explained, one essential feature of the silicas<br>
according to the invention is that the largest amount of<br>
protective substance is present within the pores of the<br>
carrier material and is not absorbed on the surface of the<br>
carrier material. This can prevent the protection system<br>
being damaged and deactivated e.g. by abrasion. For the<br>
same reason, it has proven to be advantageous to state the<br>
absorbed amount of protective substance relative to the DBP<br>
absorption of the carrier material. It has proven to be<br>
particularly advantageous if the loading of the porous<br>
carrier with protective substance is at least 10% by weight<br>
to 90% by weight, preferably 10% to 80% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably 20% to 70% by weight and very<br>
particularly preferably 20% to 50% by weight, based on the<br>
DBP absorption of the porous carrier. Too low a loading may<br>
lead, depending on the pore structure of the carrier<br>
material, to an impairment in the effect of the protection<br>
system. Too high an amount of protection system can have a<br>
disadvantageous effect on the targeted deactivation and/or<br>
is economically ineffective since as much active ingredient<br>
as possible and as little protective substance as possible<br>
should be absorbed.<br>
In the present invention, active ingredients are understood<br>
as meaning chemical compounds or natural substances which<br>
have such a high solubility and/or reactivity and/or<br>
instability under the preprocessing, storage and/or<br>
application conditions that they cannot be mixed with other<br>
components of the end formulation without suitable<br>
protective measures and/or stored and/or transported to the<br>
site of action, i.e. the site at which their reactivity is<br>
to be unfolded and/or fixed at the site of action until the<br>
desired release time. They may, however, also be chemical<br>
substances which are viscous and not very flowable and<br>
 <br>
consequently have to be made flowable through absorption on<br>
a carrier material, although desorption from the carrier<br>
material must take place rapidly and completely as far as<br>
possible, preferably exclusively, at a certain time. The<br>
active ingredients can in principle be present as liquid,<br>
oil, resin, solution, dispersion, suspension or as melt.<br>
The only prerequisite is that the active ingredient can<br>
penetrate into the pores of the carrier material.<br>
The preferred active ingredients include, inter alia,<br>
hardening agents or initiators, crosslinking agents,<br>
catalysts, pharmaceutical active ingredients, cosmetic<br>
active ingredients, cleaning and/or care agents,<br>

substances which lead to a matting of surfaces or<br>
scattering of light. Examples of the pigments that can be<br>
used are iron oxides, ultramarine blue, D &amp; C dyes, carmine<br>
and mixtures of these substances. The pigments may be<br>

US-A-4,073,880, US-A-4,278,655 and GB-A-2,018,590.<br>
These substances include in particular also compounds which<br>
are used in connection with hair cosmetic applications,<br>
such as alkali compounds, in particular NaOH, KOH, which<br>
are used in particular for producing permanent waves.<br>
The oxidizing agents and bleaches include, inter alia,<br>
compounds which release chlorine or oxygen, such as, for<br>
example, hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxides or organic<br>
peroxides.<br>
 <br>
Inorganic peroxides include, inter alia, perborates,<br>
percarbonates, perphosphates, persulfates and persilicates,<br>
it being possible to use in particular the alkali metal<br>
salts.<br>
Sodium perborate can be used, for example, in the form of<br>
the monohydrate of empirical formula NaB02H202 or the<br>
tetrahydrate according to the empirical formula<br>
NaB02H202*3H20. Alkali metal percarbonates, in particular<br>
sodium percarbonate, are often complexes of alkali metal <br>
carbonate and hydrogen peroxide. For example, sodium<br>
percarbonate is understood as meaning a complex compound<br>
with the empirical formula 2Na2C03*3H202, this being<br>
commercially available. Potassium peroxymonopersulfate can<br>
likewise be used as bleaching or oxidizing agent.<br>
Organic peroxides include, for example, arylperoxy-acids,<br>
such as, for example, perbenzoic acid, alkylperoxy acids,<br>
such as, for example, peracetic acid and pernonanoic acid,<br>
cationic peroxy acids and amide-substituted peroxy acids,<br>
which are described, for example, in EP-A-0 170 386.<br>
Further organic peroxy acids include diacyl and tetraacyl<br>
peroxides, for example diperoxydodecanoic acid,<br>
diperoxytetradecanoic acid and diperoxyhexadecanoic acid.<br>
Dibenzoyl peroxide belongs to the preferred organic peroxy<br>
acids. Mono- and diperazelaic acid, mono- and dipererucaic<br>
acid and N-phthaloylaminoperoxicapronoic acid are likewise<br>
suitable.<br>
Moreover, hardeners and/or initiators represent an<br>
important class of active ingredients. These compounds can<br>
be used inter alia in adhesives and in construction<br>
chemicals.<br>
The substances include in particular radical starters,<br>
which are used in a large number of applications. These<br>
initiators include inter alia the azo initiators known<br>
widely in the specialist field, such as AIBN and<br>
 <br>
1,1-azobiscyclohexanecarbonitrile, and also peroxy<br>
compounds, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide,<br>

two or more of the aforementioned compounds with one<br>
another, and also mixtures of the aforementioned compounds<br>
with unspecified compounds which can likewise form<br>
radicals.<br>
A further class of active ingredients is catalysts.<br>
Catalysts are used to increase the rate of a large number<br>
of different chemical reactions. The present invention<br>
permits in particular the very specific use of catalysts at<br>
a certain time, where a particularly uniform distribution<br>
of the catalyst in the reaction mixture even at the start<br>
of the reaction is possible.<br>
The preferred catalysts include in particular metal-<br>
containing catalysts which are used for hydrogenation, for<br>
example for the hardening of fatty acids, nitriles and<br>
polyol hydrogenation, hydrogenation of resins, aromatics<br>
and white oils; selective hydrogenation of acetylenes and<br>
dienes, and also selective hydrogenation of AMS to cumene.<br>
Furthermore, these include catalysts which are used for<br>
oxidation, for example for selective oxidation in the<br>
production of ethylene oxide and vinyl acetate monomers.<br>
 <br>
These catalysts generally include metals, for example<br>
nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, chromium, iron, and<br>
also platinum metals, for example rhodium, palladium,<br>
platinum. Catalysts of this type are known per se and<br>
described, for example, in Rompp Chemie Lexikon 2nd edition<br>
on CD-ROM, and also Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial<br>
Chemistry, 5th edition on CD-ROM.<br>
Moreover, the product systems can comprise active<br>
ingredients which can be used in agriculture. These<br>
include, for example, herbicides, fungicides, antibiotics,<br>
fertilizers and feed additives, for example vitamins,<br>
mineral substances and hormones, and also veterinary<br>
medicine pharmaceuticals, for example antibiotics and<br>
vaccines.<br>
Furthermore, pharmaceuticals are a class of active<br>
ingredients which may likewise be present as active<br>
ingredient in the product systems according to the<br>
invention. Pharmaceuticals are generally understood as<br>
meaning a substance which exhibits in vivo a desired<br>
effect, in particular a therapeutic effect. Accordingly,<br>
pharmaceuticals are in particular substances which can be<br>
used for the treatment of diseases or for achieving another<br>
biological effect. A pharmacologically active substance can<br>
accordingly be an organic or inorganic compound, and also a<br>
living or dead organism. These include, inter alia,<br>
proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides (e.g. heparin),<br>
oligosaccharides, mono- or disaccharides, organic<br>
compounds, organometallic or inorganic compounds which can<br>
include any known element; living or dead cells, bacteria,<br>
viruses or one part thereof; hormones; growth factors, for<br>
example virus-producing growth factor; growth factor<br>
inhibitors, growth factor receptors, receptors or receptor<br>
blockers (e.g. a 11a/111b inhibitor) or a complete or<br>
partial gene in a suitable expression vector or construct<br>
thereof for the local generation of therapeutic agents.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceuticals include agents which are used for long-term<br>
treatment, such as hormone treatments, for example for<br>
preventing conception, and substances which are<br>
particularly expedient for the treatment of diseases such<br>
as osteoporosis, cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and<br>
pain. The pharmaceuticals which can be used may be e.g.<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, agents for fighting infectious<br>
diseases (e.g. antibiotics and antivirals), analgesics and<br>
analgesic combinations, agents for the treatment of asthma,<br>
anticonvulsants, restoratives, agents for the treatment of<br>
diabetes, antitumor agents, anticancer agents and agents<br>
which are used for the treatment of cardiac vessel diseases<br>
or mental illnesses, for example depression.<br>
According to one particular aspect of the present<br>
invention, as active ingredient, it is possible to use<br>
compounds which preferably have a molecular weight of at<br>
most 2000 g/mol, particularly preferably at most<br>
1000 g/mol.<br>
The product .system of the present invention can comprise<br>
one or more active ingredients. Here, the active<br>
ingredients may be present within the porous carrier as a<br>
homogeneous mixture. Furthermore, the active ingredients<br>
can also be arranged in layer form within the porous<br>
carrier, in which case the porous carrier can have two,<br>
three or more layers which may differ from one another in<br>
terms of type and composition of the active ingredients.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, protection<br>
system is understood as meaning a substance/a combination<br>
of two or more substances which prevents/prevent the active<br>
ingredient decomposing and/or reacting prematurely and/or<br>
being undesirably able to escape from the carrier material,<br>
but at the same time also allows/allow the active<br>
ingredient to be released as rapidly and completely as<br>
possible following targeted deactivation of the protection<br>
system.<br>
 <br>
The protection system is incorporated largely, i.e.<br>
preferably to at least 30% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably to 50% by weight, very particularly preferably<br>
to 70% by weight - in each case based on the amount of<br>
active ingredient used - in the pores of the carrier<br>
material impregnated beforehand with active ingredient,<br>
such that an active ingredient layer, which is arranged<br>
closer to the core of the carrier material, and a<br>
protective layer, which is arranged facing toward the outer<br>
surface of the carrier material, are formed in the pores.<br>
The active ingredient is thus shielded from influences in<br>
the surrounding area. For example, it can be assumed that<br>
the pores of the inorganic porous carrier, which has been<br>
partially provided with active ingredient, are closed by<br>
the protective compound. Following partial breakup or<br>
partial destruction of this closure of the pores, the<br>
active ingredient can be released.<br>
The term "protection system" was chosen to make it clear<br>
that the present invention does not use a customary coating<br>
in order to achieve controlled release of active<br>
ingredients. Rather, the system is designed such that a<br>
high mechanical stability is associated with a very<br>
specific release mechanism.<br>
In order to be able to construct an effective protection<br>
system, it is advantageous if active ingredient and<br>
protection system have a different polarity or a different<br>
solubility or dispersibility so that they do not mix with<br>
one another. In this connection, the terms "soluble or<br>
dispersible" mean that at least 1 g/1, preferably at least<br>
10 g/1 and particularly preferably at least 100 g/1, of a<br>
substance can be broken up or dispersed in a corresponding<br>
solvent. Substances are insoluble if less than 1.0 g/1,<br>
preferably at most 0.5 g/1 and particularly preferably at<br>
most 0.05 g/1, of a substance can be broken up or<br>
dispersed. These values refer to the temperature at which<br>
 <br>
the loading of the carrier with the active ingredient<br>
and/or the protection system takes place. Preferably, the<br>
solubility is measured in a temperature range from 0°C to<br>
100oC, particularly preferably 25°C.<br>
It may thus be advantageous if the protection system<br>
comprises at least one compound which is soluble in a<br>
solvent in which the active ingredient does not break up.<br>
Particularly preferably, the active ingredient is soluble<br>
in a polar solvent and the protective layer is insoluble in<br>
water and/or in a polar solvent, or the active ingredient<br>
is soluble in a nonpolar solvent and the protection system<br>
is insoluble in this nonpolar solvent and/or soluble in a<br>
polar solvent and/or water. Suitable nonpolar solvents here<br>
are in particular aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes or a<br>
cycloalkane. By virtue of the different<br>
polarity/solubility, it can be ensured that the active<br>
ingredient and protection system within the pores do not<br>
mix, but form clearly separate layers, such that effective<br>
deactivation of the protective layer is possible.<br>
According to one particular aspect of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient can be broken up in a<br>
polar solvent, for example water, methanol and/or ethanol,<br>
whereas the protective layer is insoluble in water. These<br>
active ingredients include in particular water-soluble<br>
oxides and/or hydroxides, such as, for example NaOH or KOH.<br>
Preferably, the protection system according to this aspect<br>
has at least one compound which is soluble in a nonpolar<br>
solvent, particularly preferably an aromatic solvent, such<br>
as toluene, an alkane, in particular hexane or heptane, or<br>
a cycloalkane, such as cyclohexane.<br>
The protection system for the active ingredient/active<br>
ingredients is preferably designed in such a way that by<br>
deactivating the protection system through an input of<br>
energy and/or chemical conversion and/or breakup of the<br>
protection system, the protection system is changed in such<br>
 <br>
a way that, preferably spontaneously, at least 50% of the<br>
active ingredient/active ingredients is/are released.<br>
The selection of the protective material depends primarily<br>
on the release conditions. Thus, for example, the release<br>
of a radical starter in a chemical reactor may be the aim.<br>
Here, the deactivation of the protection system via<br>
pressure waves may be the method choice since this is<br>
possible very rapidly and effectively. If, for example, a<br>
radical quencher is to be added to a radical chain<br>
reaction, but can only then come into contact with the<br>
other reactants, if the reaction temperature has exceeded a<br>
certain limit - in order to prevent a "run away" of the<br>
reaction - then the protection system to be used would be a<br>
substance which releases the active ingredient upon<br>
reaching a certain temperature. Through suitable selection<br>
of the protection system, it is thus possible to produce a<br>
product system with high latency and storage stability for<br>
highly diverse application purposes. A further example is<br>
hygroscopic cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical active<br>
ingredients which are to be absorbed by the human skin. In<br>
order to be storage-stable, these substances have to be<br>
protected by a protection system and are only released<br>
again upon contact with the skin, but then rapidly and<br>
completely. For this application, a pH-sensitive protection<br>
system is the choice. The aforementioned examples in no way<br>
limit the scope of the present invention, but merely serve<br>
to explain and clarify the present invention.<br>
In the case of deactivation of the protection system by<br>
inputting energy, the energy input preferably takes place<br>
by pressure waves, particularly preferably by ultrasound<br>
treatment, irradiation with high-energy radiation,<br>
preferably UV light and microwaves and/or by the action of<br>
artificially generated shear forces and/or temperature<br>
increase. Under the influence of the pressure waves (in<br>
particular ultrasound treatment), the particulate systems<br>
 <br>
are "ruptured", because the porous carrier body and the<br>
active ingredients and protection systems stored in the<br>
pores oscillate under the influence of the pressure waves<br>
and/or cavitation at different frequencies (on account of<br>
different mechanical properties). The particles break apart<br>
and open up to the outside medium access to the no longer<br>
protected active ingredient. In the case of release by<br>
increasing the temperature, transportation of the active<br>
ingredient to the outside is ensured by the melting and/or<br>
by the increased rate of breakup of the protection system<br>
in the outside medium. In the case of release as a result<br>
of UV light or as a result of X-ray irradiation, the<br>
protection system is "deactivated" or "opened" by the<br>
radiation-based chemical reaction, which is often<br>
associated with the temperature increase up to the melting<br>
point. In the case of release due to microwaves, part of<br>
the encapsulated system is heated locally until the<br>
formation of the vapor phase, the internal pressure within<br>
the particle increases and leads, as in the case of the<br>
release under ultrasound, to the rupture of the particles<br>
and opening of the active ingredient. Another variant of<br>
the release through the action of microwaves is the local<br>
heating of the encapsulation system up to the melting of<br>
the protection system and subsequent opening of the access<br>
of the outside medium to the active ingredient.<br>
If pressure waves, preferably ultrasound waves are allowed<br>
to act on the product system, then, in one particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention, at least 80% by weight<br>
of the active ingredient/active ingredients are released<br>
within 1 hour, preferably at least 80% by weight in<br>
10 minutes, very particularly preferably at least 80% by<br>
weight in 5 minutes, especially preferably at least 80% by<br>
weight in 1 minute or less. Here, the protection system can<br>
be constructed such that it is broken up at a pregiven<br>
stress value. This can take place, for example, as a result<br>
of the targeted selection of the material and also the<br>
 <br>
amount of protection system based on the total weight of<br>
the product. The pressure waves can be adjusted by varying<br>
the frequency and the amplitude to a pregiven stress value<br>
at which breakup of the protection system takes place.<br>
Preferably, the pressure waves can have a frequency in the<br>
range from 15 kHz to 100 kHz, particularly preferably in<br>
the range from 22 kHz to 30 kHz and an amplitude in the<br>
range from 0 to 250 urn, particularly preferably in the<br>
range from 40 urn to 100 urn.<br>
If, on the other hand, high-energy radiation is allowed to<br>
act on the product system, then, in a further particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention, at least 80% by weight<br>
of the active ingredient/active ingredients are released<br>
over the course of 12 hours, preferably at least 80% by<br>
weight in 10 hours, very particularly preferably at least<br>
80% by weight in 5 hours, especially preferably at least '<br>
80% by weight in 1 hour or less.<br>
Examples of radiation-sensitive protection systems are, for<br>
example, all water-containing protection systems which can<br>
be heated locally in a targeted manner through the<br>
application of microwave technology. Preferably, the<br>
electromagnetic radiation can have a frequency in the range<br>
from 1 MHz to 500 GHz, particularly preferably in ranges<br>
from 902 MHz to 928 MHz and 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz. The<br>
electromagnetic radiation can also be adapted to other<br>
components of the system. Thus, for example, when using<br>
mixed oxides of the type MagSilica® (Evonik Industries AG)<br>
as carrier or as constituent of the protection system, the<br>
electromagnetic radiation with a frequency in the range<br>
from 280 MHz to 320 MHz is particularly preferred.<br>
If, by contrast, the deactivation of the protection system<br>
takes place on reaching a certain release temperature,<br>
then, in a further particular embodiment of the present<br>
invention, at least 60% by weight of the active<br>
ingredient/active ingredients are released over the course<br>
 <br>
of 60 minutes, preferably at least 80% by weight in<br>
60 minutes, very particularly preferably at least 80% by<br>
weight in 45 minutes, especially preferably at least 80% by<br>
weight in 30 minutes or less. In this case, the protective<br>
layer is broken up or melted by increasing the temperature,<br>
as a result of which the active ingredient is released.<br>
According to this aspect of the present invention, the<br>
protection system can be broken up preferably by a<br>
temperature in the range from 30 to 200°C, particularly<br>
preferably 40°C to 160°C. Here, the protective layer is<br>
preferably destroyed within a narrow temperature interval.<br>
Thus, the temperature interval at which the protection<br>
system is broken up or melted can be less than 20°C,<br>
preferably less than 10°C and very particularly preferably<br>
less than 5°C.<br>
Chemical deactivation of the protection system can be<br>
triggered, for example, by a shift in pH and/or the action<br>
of at least one enzyme on the protection system.<br>
If the deactivation takes place by changing the pH of the<br>
protection system, then, in a further particular embodiment<br>
of the present invention, at least 70% by weight of the<br>
active ingredient/active ingredients are released over the<br>
course of 8 hours, preferably at least 80% by weight in<br>
8 hours, very particularly preferably at 80% by weight in<br>
5 hours, especially preferably at least 70% by weight in<br>
1 hour or less.<br>
Examples of pH-sensitive protection systems are, for<br>
example, a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethyl<br>
acrylate (Eudragit L 100-55/L, Acryl EZE, Eastacryl 30D), a<br>
copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate and<br>
methacrylic acid, a (meth)acrylate copolymer consisting of<br>
20 - 40% by weight of methyl methacrylate and 60 to 80% by<br>
weight of methacrylic acid (Eudragit L 100/L, S 100/S and<br>
further modifications of the Eudragit0 product group), a<br>
copolymer of methyl methacylate, ethyl acrylate and<br>
 <br>
trimethylammonium ethyl methacrylate, a polyvinyl acetate<br>
phthalate (PVAP, Coateric® , Sureteric® ), a crosslinked<br>
and/or uncrosslinked polyacrylic acid,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (H.P.M.C.P.<br>
(Eastman), HP (Shin-Etsu)), hydroxymehylethylcellulose<br>
(HEMC), ethylcellulose (EC, Ethocel® , Aquacoat® ,<br>
Surelease® ), cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP, Cellulosi<br>
acetas, PhEur, Celluloseacetate-Phtalate, NF, Aquateric® ),<br>
cellulose acetate succinate (CAS), cellulose acetate<br>
trimeliate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate<br>
(HPMCP, HP50, HP55), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate<br>
succinate (HPMCAS -LF, -MF, -HF) or a mixture of said<br>
polymers, fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid, palmitic acid)<br>
and a mixture of the fatty acids, further polymeric acids,<br>
for example polyacrylates which are characterized by the<br>
required solubilities as a function of pH on the one hand,<br>
and by good processability on the other hand. Further<br>
polymeric acids which can be used as coating materials are<br>
copolymers of an unsaturated polycarboxylic acid such as<br>
maleic acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid and mesaconic<br>
acid with an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid such as<br>
acrylic acid or α-alkyl-substituted acrylic acids.<br>
In the case of the action of enzymes on the protection<br>
system, in a further particular embodiment of the present<br>
invention, at least 80% by weight of the active<br>
ingredient/active ingredients are released over the course<br>
of 24 h, preferably at least 80% by weight in 15 hours,<br>
very particularly preferably at least 80% by weight in<br>
10 hours or less.<br>
Examples of biologically/enzymatically deactivatable<br>
protection systems are the natural, semisynthetic or<br>
synthetic, inorganic and in particular organic materials<br>
known in the prior art, provided it is ensured that the<br>
enzymatic-controlled opening of the resulting mixtures is<br>
retained.<br>
 <br>
Natural organic materials are, for example, homopolymers<br>
and heteropolymers of carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleic<br>
acids, amides, glucosamines, esters, gum Arabic, agar agar,<br>
agarose, maltodextrins, alginic acid or its salts, e.g.<br>
sodium or calcium alginate, liposomes, fats and fatty<br>
acids, cetyl alcohol, collagen, chitosan, lecithins,<br>
gelatin, albumin, schellack, polysaccarides, such as starch<br>
or dextran, cyclodextrins, sucrose and waxes.<br>
Semisynthetic encapsulation materials are, inter alia,<br>
chemically modified celluloses, in particular cellulose<br>
esters and ethers, e.g. cellulose acetate, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and also starch derivatives, in<br>
particular starch ethers and esters.<br>
Synthetic encapsulation materials are, for example,<br>
polymers such as amino resins, polyacrylates, polyamides,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, organopolysi-<br>
loxanes, non-natural amino acids, non-natural nucleic<br>
acids, polyamines, polyols, oligo- and polyisoprenes,<br>
esters and polyesters, in particular branched glycerol<br>
ester amides, imines, polyphenols, dithiols and<br>
phosphodiesters, ethylene glycol, oxymethylene glycoside,<br>
acetal units, silicates and carbonates, hyperbranched<br>
hydrogels, comb polymers with polyester structure or<br>
polyvinyl ppyrrolidone, polylactide.<br>
Further preferred carrier polymers that can be co-used are<br>
polycaprolactones, copolymers such as poly(D,L-lactide-co-<br>
glycolide) and also the polyester compounds from the<br>
product families DynapoKSS and Dynacoll® produced by<br>
Evonik Industries AG. These polymers can also serve as<br>
admixture for establishing specific polymer properties.<br>
By admixing these polyesters, the composition of the<br>
polymer can be adjusted such that the resulting<br>
encapsulation material can be degraded enzymatically over a<br>
 <br>
short or long time. Further biologically or enzymatically<br>
deactivatable protection systems such as hyperbranched<br>
polymers are described in detail in the patent application<br>
WO 2007/048464.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to achieve deactivation of the<br>
protection system by breaking up the protection system in a<br>
suitable solvent. Here, the product system is placed in the<br>
suitable solvent or in a two-phase system with two<br>
solvents, one of which breaks up the protection system and<br>
the other of which breaks up the active ingredient, and,<br>
preferably within 24 hours, at least 80% by weight of the<br>
active ingredient/active ingredients are released,<br>
preferably at least 80% by weight in 15 hours, very<br>
particularly preferably at least 80% by weight in 10 hours.<br>
Examples of such protection -systems are inorganic (e.g.<br>
Na2SO4) and inorganic (e.g. sodium stearate) salts, organic<br>
acids (e.g. stearic acid, palmitic acid), polymers (such as<br>
polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl chloride), copolymers,<br>
alcohols (in particular fatty alcohols), and further<br>
chemical substances which are soluble under given release<br>
conditions (temperature, pressure, composition) in a<br>
solvent present at the site of release.<br>
The product systems according to the invention exhibit<br>
excellent latency. Latency means that the product systems<br>
release no or only minimal amounts of active ingredient<br>
during their production, storage and transportation. Even<br>
upon the incorporation of the product systems according to<br>
the invention into premix formulations and their subsequent<br>
storage, no or only minimal amounts of active ingredient is<br>
released for a length of time until activation of the<br>
product systems according to the invention takes place,<br>
i.e. until the release of active ingredient is triggered as<br>
a result of the input of energy or chemical influences.<br>
 <br>
As already indicated above, the product system according to<br>
the invention permits tailored solutions to be created for<br>
a large number of application cases. Thus, for example, it<br>
is possible to produce mixtures of two or more product<br>
systems according to the invention which comprise identical<br>
or different active ingredients and different protective<br>
substances. For example, these mixtures make it possible,,<br>
upon reaching a certain temperature, for 20% by weight of<br>
the active ingredient to be spontaneously released, from<br>
formulations with temperature-sensitive protective layer<br>
and active ingredient underneath, but the remaining 80% by<br>
weight of the active ingredient to be released constantly<br>
over a prolonged period from a second product system with<br>
temperature-sensitive protective layer and active<br>
ingredient embedded underneath in a diffusion-open matrix.<br>
Another example would be a mixture of product systems, of<br>
which one part of the active ingredient is released after<br>
changing the pH, but another part is only released after<br>
the action of ultrasound. Possible combinations of active<br>
ingredient/protection systems and breakup mechanisms can be<br>
derived easily by reference to the above description and<br>
form part of the present invention even if they are not<br>
described explicitly. In a further example, the protective<br>
compound can have a very specific melting point. If the<br>
product system is heated to temperatures above this melting<br>
point, then the active ingredient is released since the<br>
protective compound is melted. This mechanism can be used<br>
for example in the field of hardeners or initiators.<br>
Furthermore, this mechanism can be used for the field of<br>
hair cosmetics.<br>
A further very specific example of product systems<br>
according to the invention is configured such that the<br>
active ingredient is latent, i.e. is released only after a<br>
certain time, but then uniformly over a prolonged period.<br>
For this, for example, an active ingredient can be<br>
introduced into the carrier material together with the<br>
 <br>
matrix material and then a protective layer according to<br>
the invention can be applied. After deactivating the<br>
protective layer, the release of the active ingredient then<br>
takes place from the matrix material in a diffusion-<br>
controlled manner such that uniform release over a<br>
prolonged period is ensured.<br>
Suitable compounds for producing the protection system,<br>
subsequently also called "protective compounds", are<br>
generally known, it being possible to select the particular<br>
compound for producing this system according to the<br>
intended use and field of application of the product<br>
system.<br>
For example, the protective compound can be a law molecular<br>
weight, oligomeric or polymeric compound. These include,<br>
for example, hydrophilic or polar polymers, in particular<br>
polysaccharides, for example cellulose, cellulose<br>
derivatives, such as cellulose acetate, methylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, crosslinked and uncrosslinked<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, crosslinked and uncrosslinked<br>
polyhydroxypropylmethylcellulose, starch or starch<br>
derivatives, for example hydroxyalkyl starch, carboxymethyl<br>
starch, crosslinked and uncrosslinked sodium cellulose<br>
xanthogenates, polyvinyl alcohols, polymethacrylates,. in<br>
particular polymethyl methacrylates,<br>
methacylate/divinylbenzene copolymers, potassium<br>
methacrylates/divinylbenzene copolymers,<br>
carboxymethylamide, polyoxyalkylene glycols, crosslinked<br>
and uncrosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyoxyethylene<br>
glycols and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Furthermore, at least one low molecular weight, hydrophilic<br>
compound can be used for producing the protection system.<br>
Furthermore, the protective compound may be a hydrophobic<br>
substance. These include, among alkylcellulose polymers<br>
which can be used in the form of latex suspensions, such<br>
 <br>
as, for example, Surelease® (Colorcon GmbH, Germany), or<br>
cellulose acetate phthalate (Aquacoat® CPD; FMC, Germany)<br>
or methacrylic acid derivatives which can be used inter<br>
alia in the form of suspensions such as Eudragit® RS, RL<br>
and NE (Rohm Pharma, Germany).<br>
Moreover, waxes can also be used as protective compound.<br>
These include, inter alia, nonionic beeswax derivatives<br>
such as Gelucire® 62/05, 50/02 or 50/13 (Gattefosse<br>
Deutschland, Germany), glycerol behenate, or other fatty<br>
acid mono-, di- or triesters of glycerol such as Precirol®<br>
ato 5 (Gattefosse Deutschland, Germany), microcrystalline<br>
wax, hydrogenated castor oil or hydrogenated vegetable oil,<br>
long-chain aliphatic alcohols, such as stearyl alcohol and<br>
carnuba wax.<br>
Furthermore, polyolefins or paraffins may be suitable<br>
compounds for producing a protection system. Particularly<br>
suitable products are available under the name Sasol Wax® ,<br>
which can be obtained from SasolTM, where in particular<br>
mention is to be made of the grades Sasol Wax® 5403, Sasol<br>
Wax® 5413, Sasol Wax® 5603 and Sasol Wax® 4110P.<br>
Protective compounds which exhibit pH dependency include<br>
polymers such as, for example, polymethacrylic acid<br>
derivatives which can be used in the form of latex<br>
suspensions, such as Eudragit® L and S (Rohm Pharma,<br>
Germany), Aquacoat® CPD, hydroxypropanol methylcellulose<br>
phthalate (HPMCP), polyvinyl acetate phthalate,<br>
hydroxypropanol methylcellulose acetate succinate, shellac,<br>
cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
copolymers of maleic acid and phthalic acid derivatives,<br>
and also mixtures thereof.<br>
Moreover, the protective compounds can in part comprise<br>
acid-soluble constituents, for example in the form of the<br>
polymers, in particular polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
hydroxypropanolcellulose, hydroxypropanolmethylcellulose,<br>
 <br>
polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, or in the form of<br>
low molecular weight substances, sugars, salts or organic<br>
acids and mixtures of these substances.<br>
Furthermore, surfactants and/or emulsifiers can be used in<br>
order to produce a protection system. These include in<br>
particular carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives, such as esters or amides of carboxylic acids<br>
which have 6 to 40, preferably 8 to 30, carbon atoms in the<br>
acid radical. Preferred carboxylic acids include, inter<br>
alia, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic<br>
acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, arachic acid, behenic<br>
acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, palmitoleic acid,<br>
stearic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, petroselic acid,<br>
ricinolic acid, elaeostearic acid, linolic acid, linolenic<br>
acid, eicosanoic acid, gadoleic acid, docosanoic acid or<br>
erucasic acid.<br>
The protection system of the product according to the<br>
invention can have one or more layers of protective<br>
compounds. For example, a second protective compound can be<br>
applied to the first protective compound. Moreover, the<br>
composition of the protective compounds in a protection<br>
system can be modified in order to obtain a layered<br>
structure.<br>
A particularly preferred protection system can have a<br>
layered structure. Here, the layered protection system can<br>
have, for example, a first layer, directed to the core,<br>
which comprises a hydrophobic first protective compound,<br>
for example a paraffin wax, and a second protective layer,<br>
directed outwardly, which comprises e.g. a surfactant as<br>
protective compound.<br>
The product systems according to the invention can be<br>
produced by introducing an active ingredient into a porous<br>
carrier and producing a protection system.<br>
 <br>
Here, the following steps are preferably carried out<br>
a)	introduction as initial charge of at least one carrier<br>
material in a solids mixing unit<br>
b)	optional evacuation of the solids mixing unit<br>
c)	optional preimpregnation of the carrier material with<br>
at least one protective substance until at most 50% by<br>
weight of the DBP absorption value is achieved<br>
d)	addition of at least one active ingredient to the<br>
solids mixing unit<br>
e)	impregnation of the carrier with active ingredient<br>
f)	optional inhibition of the active ingredient adhering<br>
to the outer particle surface of the carrier material<br>
and/or washing and/or drying<br>
g)	addition of at least one protective substance<br>
h) impregnation of the carrier with at least one<br>
protective substance<br>
i) optional washing and/or drying<br>
j) optional reactive inhibition of the active ingredient<br>
adhering to the external particle surface of the<br>
carrier material and/or washing and/or drying.<br>
The solids mixing unit used in step a) may be for example:<br>
kneaders, paddle driers, tumble mixers, vertical mixers,<br>
paddle mixers, Schugi mixers, cement mixers, Gericke<br>
continuous mixers, Eirich mixers and/or silo mixers. The<br>
temperature in the mixing unit is preferably between 5°C<br>
and 250°C, particularly preferably between 60°C and 140°C,<br>
depending on the protection system and the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
 <br>
Step b) is optional, i.e. does not necessarily have to be<br>
carried out. However, by evacuating the solids mixing unit<br>
after adding the carrier material, the pores of the carrier<br>
material can be evacuated and the gas or air present<br>
therein can be drawn out, so that more complete loading of<br>
the carrier material with active ingredient(s) and<br>
protective substance(s) can be achieved.<br>
Step c) is likewise optional and is carried out depending<br>
on the pore structure of the carrier material. As already<br>
stressed several times, it is important for the<br>
effectiveness of the protection system according to the<br>
invention that the pores are closed as completely as<br>
possible with protective substances to the outside so that<br>
the active ingredient is protected against contact with<br>
solvents. In most porous carrier materials, the pores are<br>
joined together in a more or less complex system.<br>
Consequently, it is possible that narrow pores into which<br>
neither active ingredient nor protective substance, e.g. on<br>
account of the viscosity, can penetrate, but likely<br>
solvents, inside of the carrier material, have a connection<br>
to a pore into which the active ingredient has penetrated.<br>
In this way, the case could arise that although the active<br>
ingredient cannot be removed from the actual pore into<br>
which it has soaked, as a result of the smaller "secondary<br>
pores", solvent comes into contact with the active<br>
ingredient inside of the carrier and thus some active<br>
ingredient is nevertheless removed.' As a result of a .<br>
preimpregnation of the carrier material with the protection<br>
system, such undesired effects can be avoided since as a<br>
result these "side channels" can be closed before the<br>
active ingredient is absorbed. In particularly preferred<br>
embodiments, protective substance is introduced in the form<br>
of a solution or as melt.<br>
In step d), the active ingredient or a plurality of active<br>
ingredients is added to the solids mixing unit. If a<br>
 <br>
plurality of active ingredients is to be added, these can<br>
be added simultaneously or in succession. The active<br>
ingredients can, if liquid, be added directly, or are added<br>
as melt or else also as solution or in the form of a<br>
dispersion or a suspension.<br>
In step e), the active ingredient/active ingredients are<br>
introduced into the carrier material or the preimpregnated<br>
carrier material. Here, the .mixing time/incorporation time<br>
is designed such that complete penetration of the active<br>
ingredients into the pores is ensured. Impregnation with an<br>
active ingredient is terminated when the pourability of the<br>
product measured using the flow funnels in accordance with<br>
DIN 53492 has the value 1. In one particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the active ingredient is broken up in a<br>
solvent, the solution is introduced into the carrier .and<br>
the product obtained in this way is dried in order to<br>
remove the solvent.<br>
For many fields of application, it is important that the<br>
active ingredients can actually only develop their effect<br>
at a certain time, i.e. in such cases, no kind of active<br>
ingredient must come into contact with a reactant<br>
prematurely. However, since during the impregnation in step<br>
e), i.e. during the soaking of the active ingredient into<br>
the pores, it is usually not possible to prevent at least a<br>
few active ingredient molecules adhering to the outer<br>
carrier surface, it may, depending on the field of<br>
application, be useful to inhibit these active ingredient<br>
molecules in an optional step f) or to remove them from the<br>
outer carrier surface by washing in order to ensure that<br>
active ingredient is actually present only in the pores. In<br>
the case of inhibition, active ingredient present on the<br>
surface is reacted to give an unreactive substance by<br>
virtue of a corresponding reactant. In the case of washing,<br>
the active ingredient is washed away using a suitable<br>
solvent. Depending on the active ingredient, several<br>
 <br>
washing operations are necessary. If the intention were to<br>
introduce the active ingredient/active ingredients in the<br>
form of a solution or suspension, then the solvent is<br>
preferably removed prior to adding the protective<br>
substance, preferably by evacuation or heating.<br>
In step g), the protective substance or a plurality of<br>
protective substances is added to the solids mixing unit.<br>
If a plurality of protective substances are to be added,<br>
these can be added simultaneously or in succession. The<br>
protective substances can, if liquid, be added directly, or<br>
be added as melt or else also as solution or in the form of<br>
a dispersion or a suspension. In particularly preferred<br>
embodiments, protective substance is introduced in the form<br>
of a solution or as melt. In step h), it must be ensured<br>
that the pores are filled as completely as possible since<br>
the pores which lead from the surface to the core of .the<br>
carrier particle are joined together by interpore channels<br>
which transmit solvents and could thus bring about release<br>
of the active ingredient.<br>
If the protective substance/protective substances are to<br>
have been added in the form of a solution or suspension,<br>
then preferably the solvent is removed particularly<br>
preferably by evacuation or heating.<br>
In order to remove excess protective substance, it is<br>
possible, where necessary, for a washing step with<br>
subsequent drying to take place in step i).<br>
Depending on the active ingredient and protection system,<br>
it may be useful, instead of the inhibition or the washing<br>
off of the active ingredient adhering to the outer carrier<br>
surface in step f), to carry out this inhibition or this<br>
washing operation after applying the protective layer, i.e.<br>
in step j). As a rule, it will be more effective to carry<br>
out the washing or inhibition in step j) instead of step f)<br>
since in step g) the pores have been closed by the<br>
 <br>
protective substance and thus in step j) only the active<br>
ingredient molecules adhering to the outer surface are<br>
eliminated. It is also possible to wash and/or inhibit both<br>
in step f) and also in step j). It is also possible both to<br>
wash and also to inhibit in step f) and/or j}.<br>
In specific cases, stages b) to e) and/or g) to h) are<br>
carried out several times, in which case, upon repeating<br>
steps d) and e) and/or g) and h), in each case identical or<br>
different active ingredients and/or protective substances<br>
can be used. In addition, it is advantageous to select the<br>
protective substance or the active ingredient in steps c),<br>
d), e), g) and h) the mixing conditions in such a way that<br>
the active ingredient or protective substance always<br>
remains liquid and does not dry out or crystallize out on<br>
the surface of the particles.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention, step d) is not carried out after step a), but<br>
before, i.e. the carrier material and the active<br>
ingredient/active ingredients are mixed before they are<br>
poured into the solids mixing unit. Particular advantages<br>
in this case are-in the uniformity of the active ingredient<br>
distribution within the carrier particles. This is very<br>
important in the case of high active ingredient loading (in<br>
particular in the range 60 to 80% of the DBP value) in<br>
order then to be able to load all particles uniformly with<br>
the protection system.<br>
In a further particular variant of the method according to<br>
the invention, a pretreatment of the carrier material with<br>
surfactants or with silanes can take place before the<br>
active ingredient and/or protection system is added. This<br>
can lead firstly to a hydrophobization of the carrier, as a<br>
result of which - depending on the polarity of the carrier,<br>
it is possible that it is made easier for the active<br>
ingredient(s) to penetrate deeply into the pores. Secondly,<br>
as a result, however, it is also possible to achieve<br>
 <br>
closure of ultrafine pores, which is desirable since<br>
undesired, rapid release of active ingredient can thereby<br>
be prevented.<br>
In principle, it is also possible to carry out steps c) and<br>
d) simultaneously and to add a mixture of at least one<br>
active ingredient and at least one protective substance.<br>
This may be particularly useful if the protective substance<br>
can penetrate into smaller pores than the active ingredient<br>
and thus the effect described above, i.e. the "sealing" of<br>
side pores is also possible in the event of simultaneous<br>
incorporation of protective substance and active<br>
ingredient.<br>
In order to ensure the functionality of the product systems<br>
according to the invention, in particular the mechanical<br>
stability, it is necessary that firstly no active<br>
ingredient is present on the carrier surface, but secondly<br>
also that as far as possible no protective substance is<br>
present on the outer carrier surface. Ideally, both<br>
components should be completely soaked into the pores of<br>
the carrier material. In order to achieve this, the added<br>
amount of protective substance/protective substances in<br>
step g) should be regulated such that the total amount of<br>
active ingredient/active ingredients plus protective<br>
substance/protective substances which is added during the<br>
production of the product systems corresponds to 50% to<br>
100% of the DBP absorption value (according to DIN 53601)<br>
of the carrier material.<br>
Alternatively, the production process can, however, also be<br>
controlled via the pore volume; in this case, the added<br>
amount of protective substance/protective substances .in<br>
step g) is preferably regulated such that the total amount<br>
of active ingredient/active ingredients and protective<br>
substance/protective substances which is added during the<br>
production of the product systems is greater than the total<br>
pore volume of the carrier material and that the excess of<br>
 <br>
then this condition is satisfied.<br>
Conventional methods in which a large amount of coating<br>
composition is added rapidly to the carrier material have<br>
the disadvantage that they may lead to gas inclusions in<br>
the pores, i.e. that the pores are not filled as desired<br>
with active ingredient, but with gas.<br>
The present product systems can be used in many products.<br>
These include in particular cosmetics, medicaments,<br>
deodorants, foods, construction materials, agrochemicals,<br>
adhesives, packagings and/or coating systems.<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail below by<br>
reference to examples, without any limitation being<br>
intended as a result.<br>
 <br>
protective substance/protective substances is absorbed by<br>
adding carrier material and/or carrier material laden with<br>
active ingredient/active ingredients.<br>
The mixing intensities and the dosage in the method<br>
according to the invention should be matched to one another<br>
such that pourability at the end of the application process<br>
is ensured, i.e. that a pourable powder is present in the<br>
mixer at any time. Consequently, it can be ensured that the<br>
protective substance and/or active ingredient is completely<br>
absorbed into the pores and does not adhere to the outer<br>
carrier surface. If dosing is too rapid or if mixing is not<br>
intensive enough, the result may be uneven loadings of the<br>
particles, which can ultimately lead to the pores of some<br>
particles being filled completely with active ingredient<br>
and a protective substance can no longer penetrate in and<br>
thus no latency can be achieved. In this connection, it<br>
should also be ensured that the stirring elements, e.g. IKA<br>
Duplex stirring element in the measurement kneader H60, are<br>
chosen such that no abrasion takes place as a result of<br>
shear stress. The checking for abrasion on the particles<br>
takes place by measuring the particle size distribution.<br>
For this, the carrier materials are introduced into the<br>
mixing unit used subsequently and the mixing operation is<br>
started corresponding to the subsequent procedure. After a<br>
defined mixing time, samples are taken and the particle<br>
size distribution is determined. For the particle size<br>
distribution, the deviation from the d50 value of the<br>
starting sample should not be greater than 5%. If, for<br>
example, the result of the particle size distribution<br>
before mixing is:<br>
Average particle size d50 = 23.72 µm<br>
and the result of the particle size distribution after<br>
mixing is:<br>
Average particle size d50 = 22.74 µm,<br>
 <br>
Measurement methods<br>
Determination of the DBP number:<br>
The DBP absorption (DBP number}, which is a measure of the<br>
absorptivity of a porous carrier material is determined as<br>
follows in accordance with the standard DIN 53601:<br>
12.50 g of pulverant or spherical carrier material with<br>
0 - 10% moisture content (if necessary the moisture content<br>
is adjusted by drying at 105°C in the drying cabinet) are<br>
added to the kneader chamber (article number 279061) of the<br>
Brabender absorptometer "E" (without damping the starting<br>
filter of the torque sensor). In the case of granules, the<br>
sieve fraction from 3.15 to 1 mm (stainless steel sieve<br>
from Retsch) is used (by gently pressing the granules<br>
through the sieve with a pore width of 3.15 mm using a<br>
plastic spatula). With continuous stirring (rotational<br>
speed of the kneader blades 125 rpm), dibutyl phthalate is<br>
added dropwise to the mixture at a rate of 4 ml/min at room<br>
temperature through the "Dosimaten Brabender T 90/50".<br>
Mixing in takes place only with low power consumption and<br>
is monitored using the digital display. Toward the end of<br>
the determination, the mixture becomes pasty, which is<br>
indicated by means of a steep increase in the power<br>
consumption. When 600 digits are displayed (torque of<br>
0.6 Nm) both the kneader and also the DBP metering are<br>
switched off via an electrical contact. The synchronous<br>
motor for the introduction of DBP is coupled to a digital<br>
counter so that the consumption of DBP can be read off in<br>
ml.<br>
The DBP absorption is given in the unit [g/(100g)] without<br>
decimal places and calculated using the following formula:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
where DBP = DBF absorption in g/(100g)<br>
V = consumption of DBP in ml<br>
D = density of DBP in g/ml (1.047 g/ml at 20°C)<br>
E = initial weight of silica in g<br>
K = correction factor according to moisture<br>
correction table in g/(100g)<br>
The DBP absorption is defined for the anhydrous, dried<br>
carrier materials. When using moist carrier materials, in<br>
particular precipitated silicas or silica gels, the<br>
correction factor K should be taken into consideration for<br>
calculating the DBP absorption. This value can be<br>
ascertained by reference to the following correction table,<br>
e.g. a water content of the carrier material of 5.8% would<br>
mean an addition of 33 g/(100 g) for the DBP absorption.<br>
The moisture of the carrier material is determined<br>
according to the method described below "Determination of<br>
the moisture and/or the drying loss".<br>
Tabla 1: Moisture correction table for dibutyl phthalate .<br>
absorption - anhydrous -<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Determination of the moisture or of the drying loss<br>
The moisture or else drying loss (TV) of carrier materials<br>
is determined in accordance with ISO 787-2 after drying for<br>
2 hours at 105°C. This drying loss consists predominantly<br>
of water moisture.<br>
Procedure<br>
In a dry weighing glass with ground cover (diameter 8 cm,<br>
height 3 cm), 10 g of the pulverant, spherical or granular<br>
carrier material are weighed in to precisely 0.1 mg<br>
(initial weight E). The sample is dried with an opened<br>
cover for 2 h at 105 ± 2°C in a drying cabinet. The<br>
weighing glass is then closed and cooled to room<br>
temperature in a drying cabinet with silica gel as drying<br>
agent.<br>
The weighing glass/beaker is weighed precisely to 0.1 mg on<br>
a precision balance in order to determine the final weight<br>
A. The moisture (TV) is determined in % in accordance with<br>
 <br>
where A = final weight in g and E = initial weight in g.<br>
 <br>
Average particle size d50<br>
The particle distribution of the product systems according<br>
to the invention is determined by the principle of laser<br>
diffraction on a laser diffrometer (Horiba, LA-920).<br>
To determine the particle size of powders, a dispersion<br>
with a weight fraction of ca. 1% by weight of SiO2 is<br>
prepared by stirring the powder into water.<br>
Directly after the dispersion, the particle size<br>
distribution of a part sample of the dispersion is<br>
determined using the laser diffrometer (Horiba LA-920). For<br>
the measurement, a relative refractive index of 1.09 should<br>
be chosen. All measurements are carried out at room<br>
temperature. The particle size distribution and also the<br>
relevant parameters e.g. the average particle size d50 are<br>
automatically calculated and depicted graphically by the<br>
instrument. The comments in the operating instruction<br>
should be observed.<br>
Investigating the surface composition by means of XPS<br>
Measurement principle<br>
Under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, a material surface is<br>
bombarded with soft X-ray radiation (e.g. MgKa). This<br>
detaches so-called photoelectrons, the kinetic energy of<br>
which, after they have left the material surface, is<br>
analyzed using an electron spectrometer (fig. 1).<br>
When measuring a metallic sample which is in electrically<br>
conductive contact with the spectrometer, then the<br>
following applies for the kinetic energy of the detached<br>
photoelectrons:<br>
 <br>
i.e. the energy of the irradiated X-ray radiation (hv)<br>
minus the binding energy (EB) minus the work function of<br>
 <br>
the spectrometer (ΦSp'). In the case of electrically<br>
nonconductive materials, contributions are additionally to<br>
be taken into consideration.<br>
From this balance between the excitation energy and the<br>
measured kinetic energy it is thus possible to ascertain<br>
the binding energy of the electrons to the sample atoms.<br>
This depends directly on the chemical bonding state of the<br>
elements. Thus, for example, for metallic platinum on a<br>
carrier, a different value is measured than for di- or<br>
tetravalent platinum. Sulfate-sulfur produces different<br>
values to sulfide-sulfur or sulfane-sulfur and PMMA<br>
produces different oxygen and carbon signals to<br>
polycarbonate, polyoxymethylene or Teflon. A classic<br>
example of an XPS result can be found in figure 2. It is<br>
clear that even different bonding states of the carbon in<br>
ethyl trifluoroacetate can be identified by reference to<br>
the "chemical shift" of the C signals. By reference to the<br>
so-called "chemical shift" of the XPS signals it is thus<br>
possible to differentiate different bonded atoms from one<br>
another, as a result of which it is possible to establish<br>
how large the fraction of carrier atoms or active<br>
ingredient atoms or protective substance atoms is on the -<br>
surface of the product systems according to the invention.<br>
On account of the possibility of being able to<br>
differentiate differently bonded atoms from one another,<br>
the name ""ESCA" (electron spectroscopy for chemical<br>
analysis) was coined by K. Siegbahn for this measurement<br>
method since chemical information is generated.<br>
Using XPS spectra it can be determined which elements are<br>
present in which concentration in the region of the<br>
uppermost atomic layer of materials, and using the<br>
"chemical shift" of the XPS signals, in which chemical<br>
bonding state they are present.<br>
 <br>
By means of EDP-supported evaluation method, this can be<br>
quantified with good reproducibility. The values determined<br>
herein usually correspond to a figure in area percent.<br>
By reference to overview surface analyses it is possible to<br>
integrally record e.g. 0.5 cm' of a surface, although the<br>
penetration depth of the analysis is limited to the<br>
uppermost atomic layers. In this way, any<br>
microinhomogenities that are present are discovered.<br>
Measurement of the photoelectrons emitted from the sample,<br>
as takes place during the XPS/ESCA technique, records<br>
exclusively the region of the uppermost atomic layers since<br>
the average free path length of these electrons is only a<br>
few atomic layers. Electrons which are released by<br>
ionization processes in deeper layers are no longer able to<br>
reach the surface and thus do not leave the sample.<br>
Consequently, when using soft X-ray excitation radiation<br>
and when measuring the low-energy photoelectrons detached<br>
thereby, the XPS technique is automatically surface-<br>
specific and focused on the surface properties of<br>
materials.<br>
A further advantage of XPS is that - apart from hydrogen<br>
and helium, also light elements such as B, C, N, 0 can be<br>
detected quantitatively and their chemical binding states<br>
can be observed directly.<br>
Figure 3 shows a XPS overview spectrum of Sipernat® 50<br>
laden with 20% by weight of 2-Mi in accordance with the<br>
method according to the invention. It can clearly be seen<br>
which part of the surface is formed by SiO2 and which is<br>
formed by 2-Mi. By means of substrate subtraction and use<br>
of relative sensitivity factors for the elements it is<br>
possible to formulate herefrom, in accordance with<br>
standardized methods, quantitative statements relating to<br>
the surface composition.<br>
 <br>
Carrying out the XPS measurements<br>
The XPS measurements are carried out on powder beds, where<br>
in each case 0.5 square centimeters are integrally<br>
recorded. In order to avoid contaminations of the samples<br>
and measurement artifacts, the samples are for this purpose<br>
introduced into a gold-coated highest-purity tantalum<br>
sample container (Alfa, 99.98%, ca. 0.25 mm thickness, ca.<br>
1.5 to 2 cm large) in such a way as not to result in any<br>
clumping, caking or compacting of the samples. The amount<br>
of sample is chosen such that the holder is largely filled<br>
or an area of at least 0.5 square centimeters can be<br>
measured. Each sample is then transferred to a prechamber<br>
of the XPS spectrometer (XPS plant Leybold LHS12 or Leybold<br>
MAX 100) and the chamber is evacuated to 10-8 mbar for ca.<br>
2 hours at room temperature. The sample to be investigated<br>
is then transferred to the main chamber of the XPS<br>
spectrometer and the vacuum is increased to 4 x 10-10 mbar<br>
in order to prevent impurities and measurement artifacts<br>
due to possible hydrocarbon contaminations or cross<br>
contaminations. The purity of the vacuum or of the residual<br>
gas in the measurement chamber of the XPS spectrometer is<br>
continuously monitored using a residual gas mass<br>
spectrometer (Quadrex 200, Inficon).<br>
The XPS measurements were carried out according to the ESCA<br>
method using MgKa radiation with an energy of 150 W. The<br>
analyzer of the electron energy (Leybold EA200) is operated<br>
at a transmission energy of 72 e.V. in the "fixed analyzer<br>
transmission mode". The reference used for the bonding<br>
energy scale of the spectrometer was the Au4f7/2 signal of<br>
the SCAA83 standard from the National Physics Laboratory<br>
(NPL, Teddington, GB) at 84 e.V. which is measured before<br>
and after measuring the sample to be investigated. The<br>
electrostatic charge of the samples to be investigated is<br>
compensated by electrons with a low energy from a<br>
controlled incandescent electron source which is attached<br>
 <br>
in the vicinity of the sample holder. This emission source<br>
in turn is shielded and thermally insulated in order to<br>
prevent direct heat transfer to the sample to be<br>
investigated.<br>
The evaluation was carried out according to the general<br>
recommendations of DIN Technical Report No. 39 and the<br>
report of the National Physics Laboratory DMAA(A)97,<br>
Teddington, GB, January 1987 and the findings to date of<br>
the "Surface and Micro Range Analyses" working committee<br>
NMP816 (DIN). A DS 100 data record was used in order to<br>
evaluate the XPS data by means of standard routines (with<br>
subtraction of the X-ray satellites and the background, and<br>
also taking into consideration the relative sensitivity<br>
factors valid for the spectrometer used (which are stored<br>
in the data system of the spectrometer) of the electron<br>
level reported in each case). All data are in area percent.<br>
The examples below serve to illustrate and explain the<br>
present invention, but do not limit it in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
a) Introducing the active ingredient into a porous carrier<br>
The carrier material, for example porous SiO2 (e.g.<br>
Sipernat®2200 Degussa) is introduced as initial charge in a<br>
glass vessel. The liquid active ingredient is placed into<br>
the beaker (ratio e.g. 30% by weight of SiO2 to 70% by<br>
weight of liquid active ingredient). The agglomerated<br>
particles are mixed in a Turbula mixer for ca. 30 min until<br>
the particles are pourable again. As a result of the input<br>
of energy and the adsorption and/or capillary forces within<br>
the porous SiO2 structure, the active ingredient is<br>
transported to the center of the carrier. It is likewise<br>
possible to dissolve a nonliquid active ingredient in a<br>
corresponding solvent and then to proceed as described<br>
 <br>
above. In order to adjust the active ingredient<br>
concentration, the process can be repeated as often as<br>
desired, or solutions with corresponding concentrations can<br>
be prepared. However, a drying step must be carried out<br>
between the steps in order to separate off the solvent.<br>
Precise details are given under experimental description<br>
c).<br>
b) Production of a protection system in the carrier laden<br>
with active ingredient<br>
The supported material is immersed into a solution of wax<br>
and solvent. It is advantageous to select a solvent which<br>
does not dissolve the active ingredient. Preferably, the .<br>
solution is saturated with wax in order to achieve the<br>
highest possible entry into the porous carrier. The<br>
supported particles are gently stirred for ca. 2 min in the<br>
solution before the particles are separated off again via a<br>
filter. After briefly draining off, the particles are dried<br>
in the oven. For this, a temperature below the melting<br>
temperature of the wax and also below the boiling point of<br>
the solvent is chosen. The drying can be carried out under<br>
the aforementioned conditions also in vacuo. After the<br>
particles have been completely dried, the operation is<br>
repeated three times so that at the end four layers of wax<br>
have been applied.<br>
It is likewise possible to apply a thick wax layer over a<br>
wax melt. Here, the active ingredient should be stable in<br>
the melting range of the wax. The supported material can be<br>
heated, for example, to 10 K above the melting temperature<br>
of the wax. At the same time, the capsule material can be<br>
melted. The heated supported material can be introduced as<br>
initial charge in a beaker and supplied with the wax melt,<br>
for example in the ratio 60:40 (% by weight). The material<br>
is then preferably mixed above the melting temperature for<br>
a time which is sufficiently long for the particles to be<br>
 <br>
pourable again. The particles are then cooled with mixing<br>
at ca. 5°C depending on the encapsulation material.<br>
Finally, a layer of stearic acid can be applied. For this,<br>
the procedure is as described above. The stearic acid is<br>
dissolved in solvent which does not partly dissolve the<br>
layers applied beforehand. The particles are immersed into<br>
the saturated solution for 2 min and then dried.<br>
c) Experimental description<br>
An encapsulation of NaOH was achieved in accordance with<br>
the general production procedure described above with the<br>
following experimental steps:<br>
1.	150 ml of a 10% by weight solution of solid NaOH in<br>
ethanol was applied to 50 g of SiO2 (Sipernat® 2200).<br>
2.	The laden particles were dried at 80°C in the drying<br>
cabinet for 12 hours.<br>
3.-6. Points 1 and 2 were repeated two more times in order<br>
to increase the overall loading of the active<br>
substance.<br>
7.	The particles obtained according to step 6 were<br>
immersed into a 25 percent strength solution of wax<br>
(Sasol 5403) in n-hexane for two minutes.<br>
8.	The drying was then carried out at a temperature of<br>
50°C and 500 mbar vacuum in the drying cabinet.<br>
9.-12. Points 7 and 8 were repeated two more times.<br>
13. Next, the particles were heated to 80°C, mixed with<br>
a stearic acid melt (35 g of stearic acid melt per<br>
100 g of particles) and then solidified in order to<br>
be able to produce a flowable product.<br>
 <br>
14.	Finally, the particles were immersed into a solution<br>
of 10% by weight of stearic acid in ethanol for<br>
2 minutes.<br>
15.	The drying was carried out at 50°C and 500 mbar<br>
 vacuum in the drying cabinet.<br>
The product was packaged in glass bottles.<br>
 <br>
Example 2<br>
In order to investigate the stability of the product from<br>
example 1, the product was stirred in a jacketed 1 1 glass<br>
laboratory reactor in water at 23°C or 40°C using a<br>
 laboratory propeller stirrer (200 revolutions/min). After<br>
90 minutes, there was no change in the pH. However, if the<br>
temperature is increased above 54°C - the protection system<br>
is designed such that it is opened at 54°C, then the active<br>
ingredient is released. Figure 2 shows the concentration of<br>
 the active substance in water as a function of the time and<br>
the water temperature. For the purposes of clarity, the<br>
 <br>
curve for the release experiment at 40°C has not been<br>
shown. The results of the release experiments clearly<br>
indicate the performance of the formulations according to<br>
the invention. As a result of the extremely good solubility<br>
of sodium hydroxide solution in water, even small openings<br>
or sites of damage in the protection system would mean that<br>
the sodium hydroxide solution is released. This is not the<br>
case for the product systems according to the invention/ as<br>
the storage experiments at 23 and 40°C show. However, if<br>
the temperature is increased to 60°C, then the sodium<br>
hydroxide solution is released. The product systems<br>
according to example 1 thus exhibit good storage stability,<br>
good mechanical stability (was simulated by stirring for<br>
90 minutes) and the active ingredient can be released in a<br>
targeted manner, controllable by external influences.<br>
Example 3<br>
The test sample chosen for example 3 was 2-methylimidazole<br>
(CAS No. 693-98-1) (2-Mi). 2-Mi is a heterocyclic compound<br>
with two nitrogen atoms and two double bonds with a<br>
molecular formula C4H6N2. This substance is used as reaction<br>
initiator for epoxy resin systems (Dyhard®) . The challenge<br>
was to develop an encapsulation formulation in which the<br>
initiator is protected against uncontrolled reaction, where<br>
methylimidazole is known as a very reactive substance. The<br>
release should take place at temperatures above 80°C, at<br>
which the epoxy resin curing is started. Below this<br>
temperature, no reaction must take place and the reactive'<br>
substance must not escape from the encapsulated particles.<br>
It is known that 2-Mi is very readily soluble in a<br>
multitude of organic solvents, including water.<br>
The solids carrier used was Sipernat® 50 from Evonik<br>
Degussa GmbH. The encapsulation can be carried out in<br>
principle by 2 different variants:<br>
 <br>
In variant a), the carrier material is introduced as<br>
initial charge in a mixer and heated to the melting<br>
temperature of the active ingredient. The active ingredient<br>
is then added. The 2-Mi is melted in the mixing unit and .<br>
introduced homogeneously into the carrier material by the<br>
mixing operation. In variant b), the 2-Mi is applied from<br>
the solution. For this, the carrier material is likewise<br>
introduced in the kneader as initial charge, but the<br>
kneader is not heated. The 2-Mi is dissolved in a<br>
corresponding solvent - as regards the selection of the<br>
corresponding solvent, see explanations in the<br>
description - and then fed to the mixing unit with the<br>
carrier material.<br>
In both process variants, the active ingredient is applied<br>
to the carrier material by atomization.<br>
It has been observed that application from the melt<br>
achieves a higher loading of the particles.<br>
Following the general - above-described - principles, an<br>
encapsulation of 2-Mi according to variant a) was carried<br>
out as follows:<br>
1.	50 g of Sipernat® 50 are introduced as initial charge<br>
in a kneader and heated to 170°C with mixing in the<br>
apparatus and constantly further stirred.<br>
2.	In a beaker, 80 g of 2-Mi are melted with stirring at<br>
150°C using a hotplate.<br>
3.	With constant stirring, the molten 2-Mi of the initial<br>
charge is slowly metered into the kneader by adding<br>
dropwise. Here, 60 g of 2-Mi are metered in over 30 min<br>
(dropwise addition).<br>
4.	The mixture is kneaded at 170°C for 60 min. This gives<br>
a pourable intermediate.<br>
 <br>
5.	The temperature in the kneader is then reduced to<br>
100°C.<br>
6.	In a beaker, 140 g of wax C80 is melted at 90°C.<br>
7.	The wax is added dropwise to the mixture over 60 min.'<br>
8.	The mixture is kneaded at 100°C for 60 min. This gives<br>
a pourable intermediate.<br>
9.	The temperature in the kneader is then reduced to 80°C.<br>
10.	In a beaker, 70 g of stearic acid are melted at 70°C.<br>
11.	The stearic acid is added dropwise to the mixture over<br>
30 min. This gives a viscous mass.<br>
12.	In a drying cabinet, 50 g of Sipernat® 50 are heated to<br>
80°C.<br>
13.	The Sipernat® from 12. is metered into the mixture from<br>
step 11 (spoonwise addition).<br>
14.	The mixture is kneaded at 80°C for 60 min. This gives a<br>
pourable product.<br>
15.	The kneader is cooled to room temperature and the<br>
finished product is removed and packaged in a glass<br>
bottle.<br>

Selection of the protective material depends primarily on<br>
the release conditions. In the above case of the<br>
encapsulated 2-Mi, the protective material should have a<br>
melting point of more than 80°C since the release is to<br>
take place within this temperature range.<br>
Example 4<br>
Production of product systems analogous to example 3) but<br>
with preimpregnation of the carrier material<br>
As a variation on example 3, in order to influence the<br>
surface properties of the Sipernat® 50, prior to<br>
application of the active ingredient, a treatment of the<br>
Sipernat6 50 with the surfactant Tego Twin 4000 was carried<br>
out. For this, the carrier material was introduced as<br>
initial charge in a mixer and the surfactant Tego Twin 4000<br>
was applied preferably in a weight ratio of carrier<br>
material to surfactant of 5:1. The protection system is<br>
then generated as described in steps 1 to 15 of example 3.<br>
Example 5<br>
Production of a product system corresponding to example 3)<br>
but with prior evacuation of the carrier material<br>
As a variation of example 3, Sipernat® 50 from Evonik<br>
Degussa GmbH was introduced as initial charge in a mixer<br>
and heated to the melting temperature of the active<br>
ingredient. The 2 Mi is then added to the mixer. The mixing<br>
unit was evacuated to 200 mbar abs, the 2-Mi is melted in<br>
 <br>
the mixing unit and homogeneously introduced into the<br>
carrier material by the mixing operation. The further steps<br>
were carried out as described in example 3.<br>
Example 6<br>
The structure of the product systems from example 3) was<br>
investigated<br>
To characterize the particle structure, XPS surface<br>
analyses were carried out on an encapsulated sample (as in<br>
example 3) and on an unencapsulated sample of the active<br>
ingredient 2-methylimidazole. The measurement was carried<br>
out on a powder bed of the sample over an area of 0.5 cm2.<br>
Photoelectron spectroscopy XPS gives information about the<br>
elemental coating of the particle surface. Table 2 shows<br>
the results of the analysis. The figures are in atomic<br>
percent. Assuming that the amount of adsorbed carbon is<br>
constant at 7% (carbon loading of 7% was ascertained<br>
beforehand when measuring the pure carrier material<br>
Sipernat® 50 (see table 2 below)), the molecular fractions<br>
is inferred from the stated values.<br>
Figure 3 shows a XPS overview spectrum of Sipernat® 50<br>
laden with 20% by weight, i.e. the product according to<br>
stage 4 of the method from example 3. It can clearly be<br>
seen, in particular from the N, 0 and Si peaks, that the<br>
2-Mi has been absorbed almost completely into the pores of<br>
the carrier material and only very small amounts have<br>
remained on the surface.<br>
The evaluation of the XPS spectra of the end product<br>
according to example 3 is given in table 2 below.<br>
Table 2: results of the XPS measurement<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The results from table 2 above show that 16% of the<br>
particle surface in the product system according to<br>
example 3 is formed by SiO2. This confirms that the<br>
protection system is largely located in the pores of the<br>
carrier material and the pore walls made of hard SiO2<br>
extend up to the surface of the product system, where they<br>
bring about mechanical abrasion protection. A complete<br>
protective shell around the carrier material - as in the<br>
case of a "core/shell" system - is clearly not present. In<br>
addition, the results indicate that although no<br>
inactivation of the active ingredient or separate washing<br>
steps were carried out with the product systems according<br>
to the invention as in example 3, only 7.3% of 2-Mi are<br>
present on the particle surface and thus the majority of<br>
the 2-Mi was soaked into the pores of the carrier.<br>
Example 7:<br>
In this example, the storage stability of resins comprising<br>
a hardener and 2-Mi as accelerator was investigated. For<br>
this, in one case a 2-Mi encapsulated according to the<br>
invention (with 20% by weight active ingredient loading)<br>
 <br>
and in another case pure 2-Mi was incorporated into a<br>
mixture of a resin and a hardener and the mixture was<br>
investigated rheologically in order to measure the<br>
hardening of the system. Here, as the viscosity increases,<br>
the hardening is more advanced.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As can be seen from table 3 above, the resin comprising<br>
pure 2-Mi has already completely hardened after 5 days and<br>
is no longer processable. However, when using the product<br>
systems according to the invention, even after 8 days, the<br>
viscosity is still better than when using pure 2-Mi. Even<br>
after a storage time of 3 weeks, the resin comprising the<br>
product systems according to the invention is still liquid<br>
and can still be processed. Consequently, the processing<br>
time was more than quadrupled. A further advantage is that,<br>
after 3 weeks and after processing the resin, the<br>
protection system can be destroyed through targeted<br>
activation and therefore the 2-Mi can be rapidly released.<br>
