2005 and U.S. Provisional Application 60/728,607 filed October 20, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The instant invention relates to improved processes for the preparation of<br>
polynucleate aluminum hydroxyl-halide complexes and of disinfectants. The instant<br>
invention obtains simplified processes for the preparation of polynucleate aluminum<br>
hydroxyl-chloride complexes, known as polynucleate aluminum compounds (PAC)<br>
and aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH), with ACH normally used to define products<br>
having basicities of over 50% and having a higher corresponding aluminum content.<br>
All of these complexes have the general formulation Alx(OH)yClz.<br>
The instant invention also obtains simplified processes for the preparation<br>
of polynucleate metal hydroxy-halide complexes having the general formulation<br>
Mx(OH)yHz, where H is a halogen, preferably CI, and M is at least one metal or<br>
group of metals in either +2 or the +3 valence state and wherein, M is added to<br>
the polynucleate aluminum hydroxy-halide metal complex in the form of the metal<br>
halide acid solution, the base metal, the metal oxide or the metal hydroxide.<br>
As defined in this instant invention, the term metal polymer (MP) is meant<br>
to refer to any polynucleate aluminum or polynucleate metal(s) complex or<br>
compound, including those which do not contain aluminum.<br><br>
These MP are intended for use in liquid solids separations, such as in water<br>
purification, sludge dewatering and paper production, as well as solids dewatering and<br>
similar dewatering applications, being delivered in solution or in solid form. These MP<br>
can be used in a variety of applications including water purification, antiperspirants,<br>
corrosion control, and conductivity. The applications for these MP are only limited by<br>
the inclusion metal(s) and the application mechanism of the associated product,<br>
whether that product be in liquid, solid or dry form.<br>
The instant invention obtains simplified processes for MP, wherein the halogen<br>
raw material is in a salt form and is converted to an acid form via either acidification<br>
with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and/or sulfurous acid (H2SO3) or with electrolysis. The<br>
instant invention obtains improved processes for the manufacture of disinfectants,<br>
wherein the disinfectant contains an oxidative element or compound, and wherein<br>
the energy of manufacture is obtained from the energy of formation from at least<br>
one selected from a list consisting of: sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the burning of sulfur<br>
(S) in air or O2, sulfur trioxide (SO3) from the oxidation of SO2, H2SO4 formation from<br>
SO3, sulfurous acid (H2SO3) formation from SO2 with air or O2, halide acid formation<br>
from the reaction of a metal halide with an acid based upon an oxidation state of<br>
sulfur (a sulfoxy acid, preferably H2SO4 and/or H2SO3) and any combination therein.<br>
The instant invention obtains improved processes for the manufacture of an acid and<br>
a base, wherein said acid is based upon a halogen anion and wherein said base is<br>
based upon the hydroxyl anion. The instant invention provides for an improved<br>
process for the manufacture of gypsum, calcium sulfate di-hydrate, as well as<br>
calcium sulfate V2 hydrate, calcium sulfite and calcium hydrogen sulfite, wherein<br>
sulfur is a raw material for the manufacture of gypsum, and wherein said sulfur is<br>
preferably a product of the purification of a hydrocarbon, such as oil.<br>
The processes of the instant invention: use less expensive raw materials,<br>
manage heat and chemical energy more efficiently, have lower transportation costs<br>
and require less handling of hazardous chemicals thereby requiring significantly less<br>
manufacturing cost.<br><br>
Description of the Prior Art and Background<br>
PAC - Since the 1970's it has been known in the art to prepare polynucleate (or<br>
polynuclear) aluminum complexes, also known as aluminum polymers. The first<br>
products that showed promise were poly aluminum sulfates. Processes for the<br>
production of poly aluminum sulfates are disclosed and presented in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,284,611 and 4,536,665 and Canadian Patent Nos. 1,203,364; 1,203,664;<br>
1,203,665; and 1,123,306, while used as a reference in this instant invention. In<br>
these patents, poly aluminum sulfate is produced by reacting sulfate solutions with<br>
sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to form an insoluble aluminum hydroxide gel,<br>
wherein soluble sodium sulfate is then removed.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,597 describes another process for the production of<br>
poly aluminum sulfate, while used as a reference in this instant invention. This<br>
process eliminated the initial step of producing an aluminum hydroxide gel by<br>
reacting aluminum sulfate with sodium aluminate.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,544,476 discloses a process for the formation of a poly<br>
aluminum chloral-sulfate, while used as a reference in this instant invention. It is<br>
prepared by first producing an aluminum chloride/aluminum sulfate solution and<br>
then basifying this solution with calcium carbonate of lime. The insoluble calcium<br>
sulfate is removed.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,196,016; 2,392,153; 2,392,153; 2,392,531; 2,791,486;<br>
3,909,439, and 4,082685 disclose processes for the production poly aluminum<br>
chloride (low basicity ACH), while used as a reference in this instant invention.<br>
These processes involve reacting aluminum oxy-hydrates or aluminum hydroxy-<br>
hydrates with hydrochloric acid (HCI) under high temperature and pressure<br>
conditions.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,362,643 and 4,417,996 disclose processes for the<br>
production of poly aluminum-iron complexes, while used as a reference in this<br>
instant invention. These processes involve reacting aluminum chloride/iron<br>
chloride solution with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxy-hydrates, as well as<br>
reacting a poly aluminum chloride with iron.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,131,545 discloses a process for the production of poly<br>
aluminum sulfate compounds by reacting aluminum sulfate with phosphoric acid<br><br>
and calcium sulfate, while used as a reference in this instant invention. In the<br>
water industry, it is known at this time that PAC compounds containing sulfate are<br>
known to out perform aluminum salts, iron salts, PAC and ACH in water<br>
temperatures from approximately 34 to approximately 40° F (4 °C).<br>
The most common PAC is ACH. ACH is the most common PAC due to its<br>
higher aluminum content, which significantly increases the effectiveness of the<br>
PAC in operating temperatures over 40° F (4 °C). U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,051,028 and<br>
4,390,445 disclose processes for the formation of a poly aluminum<br>
hydroxychloride (ACH), while used as a reference in this instant invention. It is<br>
prepared by reacting aluminum chloride solution and aluminum hydroxide with<br>
calcium carbonate or lime. Insoluble calcium carbonate is removed. U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 4,034,067 and 5,182,094 disclose processes for the formation of a poly<br>
aluminum hydroxychloride, while used as a reference in this instant invention. It<br>
is prepared by reacting aluminum chloride solution with alumina or aluminum<br>
hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,970 discloses a method of forming polynucleate bi-<br>
metal hydroxide complexes (2 metals are used), while used as a reference in this<br>
instant invention. This process describes the use of a trivalent metal in<br>
combination with a divalent metal, wherein the trivalent metal is in an acid<br>
solution and is reacted with the oxide or hydroxide form of the divalent metal.<br>
WO 97/11029 (PCT/US96/13977) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,234 disclose a<br>
method of forming polynucleate aluminum complexes, wherein sodium aluminate is<br>
required to be reacted with either aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorosulfate,<br>
while used as a reference in this instant invention; the reaction is carried out<br>
under conditions of high shear agitation to minimize gel formation. The reaction is<br>
to be carried out at a temperature of under 50 °C producing a milky suspension<br>
which clears over time.<br>
At this time, ACH is known to be prepared by four methods. The first method<br>
is by reacting alumina and/or aluminum hydroxide with aluminum chloride solution<br>
(ACS) in a single step process at elevated temperature or pressure or both. Alumina<br>
is defined in the instant invention as any mixture comprising primarily aluminum oxy-<br>
hydrates and/or aluminum hydroxy-hydrates as those occur in nature and as purified<br><br>
from raw bauxite. Raw bauxite is purified by the Bayer process which utilizes the<br>
amphoteric nature of aluminum, which allows aluminum to be soluble at high pH as<br>
well as at low pH. Other metals do not exhibit this characteristic. Thereby aluminum<br>
is purified from other metals at a pH of approximately greater than 10.0 and at high<br>
enough operating temperature to flow the aluminum oxy- and hydroxy-hydrates.<br>
The second method is by reacting HCI with an excess of alumina and/or aluminum<br>
hydroxide at elevated pressure and/or temperature. The third process is by reacting<br>
alumina and/or aluminum hydroxide with HCI and metal carbonates or metal oxides<br>
at elevated temperature and/or pressure. The fourth method, which is disclosed in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,904,856, presents a method of acidifying cement in HCI or ACS. A<br>
consequence of the second and the third process is large amounts of non-reacted<br>
aluminum hydroxide material that have to be returned to the process, which makes<br>
the process considerably more expensive. A consequence of the third process is a<br>
frothing of the carbonates in the reaction vessel; further, these products do not dry<br>
well should one desire a dry final aluminum polymer. The first and fourth processes<br>
are very expensive requiring the transport of large quantities of ACS. The second,<br>
third, and fourth processes are very expensive requiring the transportation of large<br>
quantities of HCI. Depending upon the concentration, HCI is at least approximately<br>
65 percent water and ACS is at least approximately 60 to 90 percent water, the<br>
transportation of HCI or ACS requires the transportation and handling of large<br>
quantities of water and is therefore not economical. A consequence of the fourth<br>
process is the cost of first preparing the sintered cement containing Al2O3 and CIO. A<br>
consequence of all these processes is a purity limitation of the bauxite, if bauxite is<br>
used, as metal impurities in some forms of bauxite cannot be polymerized in the PAC<br>
when the PAC is used for drinking water purification.<br>
All of these PAC and MP patent(s) are incorporated herein as a reference.<br>
All of these processes are limited with regard to the starting materials. Per any of<br>
these processes, large amounts of HCI or ACS or other metal acid solution must be<br>
handled. Per any of these processes, to prepare the ACS, HCI must be used. In<br>
summary, all require transportation, storage, and handling of large quantities of<br>
hazardous chemicals.<br><br>
Further, the drinking water industry is placing restrictions on the amount of<br>
soluble aluminum in the final water product. Industrial processes have for years<br>
restricted aluminum salt coagulation to eliminate soluble aluminum in the final purified<br>
water. PAC(s) do not produce soluble aluminum in the final water. MP's do not place<br>
a soluble metal into the water. Due to requirements in both potable and industrial<br>
water coagulation, a safer, simpler and more economical process is needed for the<br>
manufacture of PAC(s) and MP(s).<br>
Energy - None of these processes manage heat or chemical energy in an efficient<br>
manner. All of these processes require adding heat to the PAC or MP reactor and<br>
require heat in the preparation of alumina with no consideration given to the<br>
exothermic nature of either HCI or ACS formation. All of these processes require<br>
the preparation of HCI or delivery of HCI prior to ACS manufacture, while there<br>
are significant amounts of potential chemical energy available in the conversion of<br>
sodium chloride to HCI and in the conversion of aluminum to ACS utilizing HCI.<br>
Finally, none of these processes investigate either the use of H2SO4 and/or H2SO3<br>
for the preparation of HCI, the very exothermic production of H2SO4 and/or H2SO3<br>
from S or the very exothermic formation of HCI from a metal chloride salt reacting<br>
with H2SO4 and/or H2SO3, all of which present the ability to produce heat energy,<br>
steam and electricity.<br>
HCI - Other than the lost energy and the cost of purchase, HCI transportation has<br>
many issues, which include increased cost and environmental concerns. HCI has to be<br>
transported and suitable ventilation has to be arranged in order to eliminate the<br>
release of Hydrogen Chloride gas, HCI(g). Further, aqueous chlorine (CI), or the<br>
chloride ion, is produced from aqueous HCI. The chlorine (Cl2) production process is<br>
an expensive one that requires drying and refrigeration prior to storage. The most<br>
significant issue with Cl2 is storage. Cl2 is an extremely hazardous chemical to store;<br>
therefore, storage of Cl2 is expensive. The hazardous nature of Cl2 has, in recent<br>
years, caused many water purification facilities to reevaluate the usage of Cl2 versus<br>
bleach or other disinfectants.<br><br>
Upon contact with water, Cl2 forms both the chloride ion and the chlorite<br>
ion. The chlorite ions are decomposed into chloride ions with temperature. The<br>
addition of heat to large volumes of liquid is also very expensive. Moreover, HCI<br>
must be stored and transported in polymer-lined containers where the releases of<br>
HCI(g) vapors must be controlled. In summary, the production and transportation<br>
of HCI and/or Cl2 is both expensive and hazardous.<br>
ACS - ACS is formed by the reaction of HCI with aluminum hydroxide, alumina<br>
(aluminum hydroxide and/or aluminum oxide in the dry or hydrate form) or<br>
aluminum. While ACS can be prepared from bauxite, this is not preferred in most<br>
applications because the acidification of aluminum in bauxite to ACS can also acidify<br>
any other metal impurities that may be present in the raw bauxite. Formation of<br>
ACS also releases HCI(g), which must be controlled. This is an expensive process.<br>
Therefore, in summary, the current processes always provide complications leading<br>
to increases in the cost of the final product, as well as many safety concerns which<br>
must be managed.<br>
Disinfectants - Further yet, in all applications of water purification, there are<br>
efforts to eliminate the formation of chloro-organic compounds, which have been<br>
found to be at least one of: toxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic and any combination<br>
therein. The drinking water industry is limiting Cl2 and bleach disinfection,<br>
investigating alternative disinfectants such as H2O2, O2, ozone (O3) and chlorine<br>
dioxide (CIO2). The power industry has learned that those same chloro-organic<br>
compounds prematurely contaminate demineralizer beds, thereby resulting in the<br>
use of such alternative such as H2O2, O2, O3 and CIO2. The paper industry has<br>
learned that those same chloro-organic compounds are found in both the final<br>
paper product and in the plant wastewater, thereby requiring investigation of<br>
alternatives such as H2O2, O2 and O3. The manufacture of O3 requires O2, which is<br>
an expensive product formed by either separation of air or electrolysis of water.<br>
Also, CIO2 is an extremely hazardous chemical to transport, thereby requiring on-<br>
site generation from other Cl2 compounds, such as bleach (hypochlorite), chlorite<br>
and chlorate. Previous work in the manufacture of chlorite and chlorate is<br><br>

While there are many methods to prepare H2O2, there are two primary<br>
chemical manufacturing processes: the hydroquinone (HQ) process and the sulfuric<br>
acid/electrolysis (SAE) process. Historically, SAE was the preferred process until the<br>
1960's and 1970's wherein industry converted to HQ due to the operating cost savings<br>
of eliminating the electrical cost associated with SAE. However, by its nature, HQ has<br>
a limitation of organic contamination, which is due to the use of an organic chemical<br>
(hydroquinone) as a catalyst. Further, the discovery of chloro-organic toxicity has lead<br>
industry to require more pure forms of H2O2. In H2O2 manufacturing, membranes<br>
have been discussed as methods of H2O2 purification. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,879,043 and<br>
6,333,018 present the use of reverse osmosis membrane technology as a final<br>
purification step in the production of H2O2 manufactured by HQ, while used as a<br>
reference in this instant invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,215,665; 5,262,058 and 5,906,738<br>
present the use of reverse osmosis membrane technology in combination with cationic<br>
resin technology as final purification steps in the production of H2O2 manufactured by<br>
HQ, while used as a reference in this instant invention. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,851,042 and<br>
6,113,798 present the use of converting contaminant particles by reacting said<br>
particles with micro-ligands, then separating said reaction products with membranes as<br>
a final purification step in the production of H2O2 manufactured by HQ, while used as a<br>
reference in this instant invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,796 presents an<br>
electrochemical reactor wherein O2 and H2 are reacted across a conductive membrane<br>
containing reducing catalysts forming H2O2, while used as a reference in this instant<br>
invention. This novel process eliminates HQ while simplifying the process H2O2<br>
production. However, the potential for contamination of H2O2 with heavy metals from<br>
the reducing catalyst is significant. Heavy metals contamination eliminates the<br>
potential use of H2O2 in either the production of micro-circuitry or water purification. In<br>
addition, the potential safety issues from the reaction of very explosive O2 and/or H2 in<br><br>
an electrolytic environment preclude the potential use of this process at the end-use<br>
site. U.S. Publication 20040126313 teaches the use of membrane technology in<br>
combination with SAE; however, a source of electricity is not presented. None of these<br>
references present SAE with a source of electricity. All of these H2O2 patents are<br>
incorporated herein as a reference.<br>
While there are many methods to prepare O2, the separation of air into its<br>
component gases is performed by three methods: cryogenic distillation, membrane<br>
separation and pressure swing adsorption (PSA, which includes vacuum).<br>
Conventional cryogenic distillation processes that separate air into O2, Argon (Ar) and<br>
nitrogen (N2) are commonly based on a dual pressure cycle. Air is first compressed<br>
and is subsequently cooled, wherein cooling is accomplished by one of four methods:<br>
1 - vaporization of a liquid, 2 - the Joule Thompson effect; 3 - counter-current heat<br>
exchange with previously cooled warming product streams or with externally cooled<br>
warming product streams, and 4 - the expansion of a gas in an engine doing external<br>
work. The cooled and compressed air is usually introduced into two fractioning zones.<br>
The first fractioning zone is thermally linked with a second fractioning zone which is at<br>
a lower pressure. The two zones are thermally linked such that a condenser of the<br>
first zone reboils the second zone. Air undergoes a partial distillation in the first zone<br>
producing a substantially pure N2 fraction and a liquid fraction that is enriched in O2.<br>
The enriched O2 fraction is an intermediate feed to the second fractioning zone. The<br>
substantially pure N2 from the first fractioning zone is used as reflux at the top of the<br>
second fractioning zone. In the second fractioning zone, separation is completed<br>
producing substantially pure O2 from the bottom of the zone and substantially pure N2<br>
from the top. When Ar is produced or removed a third fractioning zone is employed.<br>
The feed to this third zone is a vapor fraction enriched in Ar which is withdrawn from<br>
an intermediate point in the second fractioning zone. The pressure of this third zone is<br>
of the same order as that of the second zone. In the third fractioning zone, the feed is<br>
rectified into an Ar rich stream which is withdrawn from the top, and a liquid stream<br>
which is withdrawn from the bottom of the third fractioning zone and introduced to the<br>
second fractioning zone at an intermediate point. Reflux for the third fractioning zone<br>
is provided by a condenser which is located at the top. In this condenser, Ar enriched<br>
vapor is condensed by heat exchange from another stream, which is typically the<br><br>
enriched O2 fraction from the first fractioning zone. The enriched O2 stream then<br>
enters the second fractioning zone in a partially vaporized state at an intermediate<br>
point above the point where the feed to the third fractioning zone is withdrawn.<br>
The distillation of air, a ternary mixture into N2, O2 and Ar may be viewed as<br>
two binary distillations. One binary distillation is the separation of the high boiling<br>
point O2 from the intermediate boiling point Ar. The other binary distillation is the<br>
separation of the intermediate boiling point Ar from the low boiling point N2. Of these<br>
two binary distillations, the former is more difficult, requiring more reflux and/or<br>
theoretical trays than the latter. Ar-O2 separation is the primary function of the third<br>
fractioning zone and the bottom section of the second fractioning zone below the point<br>
where the feed to the third zone is withdrawn. N2-Ar separation is the primary<br>
function of the upper section of the second fractioning zone above the point where the<br>
feed to the third fractioning zone is withdrawn. The ease of distillation is a function of<br>
pressure. Both binary distillations become more difficult at higher pressure. This fact<br>
dictates that for the conventional arrangement, the optimal operating pressure of the<br>
second and third fractioning zones is at or near the minimal pressure of one<br>
atmosphere. For the conventional arrangement, product recoveries decrease<br>
substantially as the operating pressure is increased above one atmosphere mainly due<br>
to the increasing difficulty of the Ar-O2 separation. There are other considerations,<br>
however, which make elevated pressure processing attractive. Distillation column<br>
diameters and heat exchanger cross sectional areas can be decreased due to increased<br>
vapor density. Elevated pressure products can provide substantial compression<br>
equipment capital cost savings. In some cases, integration of the air separation<br>
process with a power generating gas turbine is desired. In these cases, elevated<br>
pressure operation of the air separation process is required. The air feed to the first<br>
fractioning zone is at an elevated pressure of approximately 10 to 20 atmospheres<br>
absolute. This causes the operating pressure of the second and third fractioning zones<br>
to be approximately 3 to 6 atmospheres absolute. Operation of the conventional<br>
arrangement at these pressures results in very poor product recoveries due to the<br>
previously described effect of pressure on the ease of separation. Previous work to<br>

present many innovations in the production of halogen oxides, none present<br>
wherein the energy of manufacture is obtained from the energy of formation from<br>
at least one selected from a list comprising: SO2 from the burning of S in air or O2,<br>
SO3 from the oxidation of SO2, H2SO4 formation from SO3, H2SO3 formation from<br>
SO2, halide acid formation and any combination therein.<br>
Acid Manufacture (Sulfuric, Sulfurous and Hydrochloric) - HCI is known in<br>
the art to be produced by 2 processes, the Electrolysis Unit (EU) process and the<br>
Sulfuric Acid Process (SAP). The raw materials for EU production of HCI include<br><br>
sodium chloride, water, and electricity. The raw materials for SAP production of<br>
HCI include sodium chloride, H2SO4 and water.<br>
Sulfuric acid has many forms and equivalents, all of which are based upon<br>
the sulfoxy (SxOy) anion moiety, wherein X can vary from 1 to 2 and Y can vary<br>
from 2 to 8. Examples would be sulfurous acid, sulfuric acid, oleum and persulfuric<br>
acid. As defined in this instant invention a sulfoxy acid is any proton donating acid<br>
containing a sulfoxy moiety. H2SO4 and H2SO3 are manufactured primarily by two<br>
competing processes, the condensation process and the contact process. In both<br>
cases in a sulfuric acid plant, which will be herein after referred to as the sulfuric<br>
acid reactor (SAR), S is combusted in air and/or O2 to produce SO2. SO2 is then<br>
converted into SO3 in the contact process with the use of a catalyst, usually V2O5, in<br>
the presence of excess air at a temperature of about 400 - 450 °F (204 - 233 °C).<br>
In either process, SO3 can be slowly converted into H2SO4 by contact of said SO3<br>
with H2O. In the condensation process, the combusted SO2 is contacted with H2O<br>
quickly forming H2SO3 and slowly forming H2SO4. In the contact process, said SO3<br>
is contacted with H2SO4 forming H2S2O7 (oleum); oleum is then contacted with H2O<br>
forming 100 percent H2SO4. Often the oleum step is bypassed by directly reacting<br>
said SO3 with H2SO4 and H2O, thereby forming H2SO4. It is difficult to obtain 100<br>
percent H2SO4with the condensation process.<br>
Bleach Manufacture - Bleach, a group IA or group IIA metal in solution with a<br>
hypohalite, is currently manufactured by two processes, electrolysis and acid/base<br>
blending. In electrolysis, a salt solution comprising a group IA or group IIA metal<br>
halide is placed in an electrolysis cell, wherein the salt is separated into the<br>
corresponding halide acid and the corresponding group IA or group IIA hydroxide,<br>
and wherein said halide acid and said group IA or group IIA hydroxide is allowed to<br>
mix, therein forming the corresponding group IA or group IIA metal in solution with<br>
the hypohalite while releasing hydrogen gas. In acid/base blending, a cold dilute<br>
solution of a group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide is mixed with either a halogen<br>
acid in aqueous form or with a halogen acid gas, wherein is formed the<br>
corresponding group IA or group IIA metal in solution with the hypohalite while<br>
releasing hydrogen gas. In all situations, concentration of the group IA or group<br><br>
IIA metal hypohalite in solution may be increased by adding an excess of a base,<br>
preferably the group IA or group IIA hydroxide until a concentration of about 15<br>
percent of the group IA or group IIA metal hypohalite is obtained.<br>
Under current manufacturing practices, the group IA or group IIA metal<br>
hydroxide used in the formation of a bleach is formed by the electrolysis of the<br>
corresponding group IA or group IIA salt in water. Therefore, the manufacture of<br>
any bleach is currently constrained by the cost and/or availability of electricity to<br>
perform electrolysis.<br>

Gypsum Manufacture - Gypsum, calcium sulfate di-hydrate, is a widely used<br>
product being the major component in the manufacture of wall-board or sheetrock.<br>
Gypsum is currently manufactured by three competing processes: the mining of<br>
calcium sulfate di-hydrate, the hydration of mined calcium sulfate and the<br>
scrubbing of waste sulfoxy acid gases by an oxide of calcium, usually calcium oxide<br>
and/or calcium hydroxide. In all cases, the purity of manufactured gypsum is an<br>
issue. In the case of mined calcium sulfate and calcium sulfate di-hydrate,<br>
contaminants from the earth are an issue. And, in the case of scrubbing waste<br>
sulfoxy acid gases, impurities in the gas stream are often also oxidized and left in<br>
the gypsum product.<br>

Transportation of Hazardous Chemicals and Sulfur Management<br>
As population density increases, the transportation of hazardous chemicals,<br>
including acids and disinfectants, leads to an increased incidence of spills while<br>
the consequences of spills become more serious. While solutions of halide acids,<br>
hypohalites and halites are safer disinfectants for transportation, handling, and<br>
storage, the cost of manufacture of these disinfectants has limited their use. A<br>
more economical process is required for the manufacture of O2, CIO2, halide acids,<br>
hypohalites, and halates. In addition, while the US EPA required removal of sulfur<br>
from hydrocarbon fuels has limited atmospheric releases of oxides of sulfur from<br>
combustion exhaust, said removal is creating an abundance of sulfur, such that<br>
the refining industry is in need of a way to dispose of said abundance of sulfur.<br>

said metal halide salt with said sulfoxy acid. It is preferred that said extruder and/or<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br><br><br>
Reactions which are most preferred comprise at least one selected from a list<br>
consisting of number: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 25, 26, and<br>
any combination therein. Reactions required to remove calcium and thereby<br><br>
increase product purity are 11 and 12. Reaction 26 is preferred for on-site<br>
manufacture of chlorine dioxide. Alumina is herein estimated at about 2/3<br>
aluminum oxide and 1/3 aluminum hydroxide; however, Alumina can be any<br>
concentration of the base aluminum metal with any concentration of aluminum<br>
oxide and any concentration of aluminum hydroxide. It is preferred to use at<br>
least one metal other than aluminum.<br>
Sulfoxy Acid Formation - SAR<br>
Significant economies of manufacture can be obtained by the preparation of a<br>
sulfoxy acid. A sulfoxy acid is defined herein as any acid comprising an SOx moiety;<br>
further the sulfoxy moiety is herein defined as any SOx moiety. It is most preferred<br>
that the sulfoxy acid in this instant invention be H2SO4. While the market for H2SO4<br>
and H2SO3 is very competitive, the formation of H2SO4 and/or H2SO3 from S, air and<br>
H2O or S, O2 and H2O is very exothermic. There are two processes known to<br>
manufacture H2SO4 and H2SO3, the sulfuric acid condensation (SAC) and the sulfuric<br>
acid contact process (SACP), both are herein referred to as SAR, and are an<br>
embodiment in this instant invention, with the SACP preferred. The SACP produces<br>
H2SO4 and/or H2SO3 from S, H2O and air or O2 (with one stage of reaction requiring a<br>
catalyst, preferably vanadium oxide, V2O5). Every mole of about anhydrous H2SO4<br>
produced from S, H2O, and air or O2 also produces approximately 126 kcal of energy.<br>
This valuable energy is preferably used to produce steam for at least one selected<br>
from a list comprising: the purification of bauxite, heating of the metal polymer reactor<br>
(MPR, which can used to manufacture PAC(s) as well as MP(s)), heating of an HAR<br>
and/or HAR product distillation, reducing the H2O content of by-product metal sulfate,<br>
sulfite or bisulfite salts with air evaporative dehydration, electricity generation to<br>
operate the EU and any combination therein. The SACP is summarized by:<br><br>
(Contact of SO3 with H2SO4 to form oleum can be eliminated; however, SO3 +<br>
H2O → H2SO4 is a slow reaction.)<br><br>
Sulfurous acid, H2SO3, is formed by reacting SO2, from the first reaction,<br>
with H2O.<br>
It is preferred to obtain sodium sulfite by reacting SO2, from the first reaction in<br>
an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide; a metal sulfite is formed by reacting SO2, from<br>
the first reaction in an aqueous solution of said metal hydroxide or by reacting a metal<br>
sulfite with H2SO3.<br>
It is preferred to obtain sodium bisulfite by the reaction of SO2, from the<br>
first reaction, in an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate; and a metal bisulfite is<br>
formed by the reaction of SO2, from the first reaction, in an aqueous solution of<br>
said metal carbonate.<br>
In addition to the electrical and steam energy economics of H2SO4 and/or<br>
H2SO3 production, on-site production of H2SO4 and/or H2SO3 eliminates the<br>
transportation and storage of H2SO4 and/or H2SO3. As discussed previously, H2SO4<br>
and/or H2SO3 are hazardous chemicals that must be stored in the appropriate<br>
tankage, wherein the vapors must be controlled. Therefore, it is preferred that<br>
H2SO4 and/or H2SO3 produced for the HAR have minimal volume storage. It is a<br>
most preferred embodiment to produce H2SO4 and/or H2SO3 from the SACP and<br>

reaction of the corresponding metal halide salt with a sulfoxy acid.<br>
In the formation of said metal halite, it is an embodiment of the instant<br>
invention to react chloride ions, preferably having a concentration of from about 1 M<br>
to about 5 M, with chlorate ions, preferably having a concentration of from about 0.1<br>
M to about 7 M, in an aqueous acid reaction medium having an acid normality of<br>
from about 0.05 N to about 5 N. As sodium chloride precipitates in the system, it<br><br>
may be separated by means of a filter or recycled in a solution or slurry to the EU. A<br>
gaseous product mixture comprising a halogen dioxide, preferably chlorine dioxide,<br>
may be absorbed in any suitable aqueous medium. However, it is beneficial for the<br>
absorption medium to preferably absorb chlorine dioxide and less preferably chlorine.<br>
An example of such a medium is dilute hydrochloric acid. A suitable reagent able to<br>
destroy traces of chlorine, such as, for example hydrogen peroxide, may optionally<br>
be added to the absorption medium, if desired.<br>
In order to transfer the absorbed chlorine dioxide from the absorption<br>
medium to the chlorite formation reactor, any suitable gas stripping method may<br>
be employed. The stripping of chlorine dioxide may be carried out with an inert<br>
gas or gas mixture, such as air or nitrogen. If air is used in the chlorine dioxide<br>
stripping, it is preferred to purify the air from traces of carbon dioxide, by using,<br>
for example, a caustic scrubber. Hydrogen peroxide can optionally be added to<br>
the system prior to effecting the stripping step.<br>
It is preferred to transfer the gaseous product mixture formed in the chlorine<br>
dioxide generator directly to the chlorite formation reactor without the intermediate<br>
step of chlorine dioxide absorption and stripping. Instead of absorption/stripping, gas<br>
transfer membranes can be employed, as in known in the art, thereby allowing the<br>
transfer of chlorine dioxide in the absence of any air addition.<br>
It is an embodiment to modify the halogen dioxide generator by addition of a<br>
supplementary reducing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, as is known in the art.<br>
It is also an embodiment to improve the performance of the halogen-<br>
dioxide generator by using any suitable catalytically-active agent containing<br>
elements, such as silver, manganese, palladium, chromium, vanadium or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
While it is known in the art to use the chloride ion as an inexpensive<br>
reducing agent, the reaction of the chloride ion with the chlorate ion necessarily<br>
results in the formation of some chlorine, e.g.:<br><br>
which may negatively affect purity of the final halite, preferably chlorite, product<br>
while increasing use of hydrogen peroxide. It is therefore, a preferred<br><br>
embodiment to generate said halogen dioxide, preferably chlorine dioxide, by<br>
reaction 26.<br>
Reaction 26 can be carried out in a very broad acid normality range of from<br>
about 2 N to about 14 N, preferably from about 6 N to about 12 N. The optimum<br>
chlorate ion concentration is dependent on acid normality in the reaction medium and<br>
can vary from about 0.1 M to saturation, preferably from about 0.5 M to about 3.5 M.<br>
Operation at higher acidities is typically associated with a lower chlorate concentration<br>
in the reaction medium. The gaseous product mixture comprising chlorine dioxide and<br>
water vapor can be used directly in the chlorite formation reactor without the<br>
intermediate step of recovery of chlorine dioxide solution, i.e., by omitting the<br>
absorption and stripping stages.<br>
Such an operation leads to significant cost savings due to the elimination of<br>
certain parts of the conventional chlorine dioxide generating system, such as<br>
condenser, absorption tower and stripping tower.<br>
The co-produced oxygen gas can be used along with the water vapor for the<br>
dilution of gaseous chlorine dioxide to safe concentration levels. By adjusting the<br>
chlorine dioxide to water vapor ratio to meet the requirements of the chlorite<br>
formation reactor, the water balance of the overall system is improved. The relative<br>
ratio of chlorine dioxide and water vapor in the gaseous mixture entering the chlorite<br>
formation reactor affects the concentration of metal halite, preferably group IA or<br>
group IIA metal chlorite, in the final product aqueous solution. Therefore, there may<br>
still be a need to condense at least some of the water vapor.<br>
It is preferred to integrate the halogen dioxide, preferably chlorine dioxide,<br>
generator with a methanol based chlorine dioxide generating system, as is known<br>
in the art, wherein the acidic, sulfate and/or bisulfate containing effluent or slurry<br>
formed in the hydrogen peroxide based generator is cascaded to the methanol<br>
based generator. This integration eliminates the requirement for the filtration step<br>
following the hydrogen peroxide based generator.<br>
The above described cascade of two chlorine dioxide generators offers<br>
several advantages which are difficult to accomplish in conventional generators.<br>
For example, it is possible to add a small amount of sodium chloride, typically<br>
about 0.5 to about 1.0 wt. % based on the chlorate, to the hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
based generator preferably operating at acid normalities above 5N. Such an<br>
addition of chloride may have little or no impact on the chlorine dioxide purity<br>
resulting from the hydrogen peroxide based process, while such addition may be<br>
beneficial with regard to the production rate and efficiency. The presence of<br>
hydrogen peroxide should effectively prevent chlorine from being generated in the<br>
chlorine dioxide generating process.<br>
It is an embodiment to recover the metal sulfate and/or bisulfate, preferably<br>
sodium sulfate and/or sodium bisulfate, following the hydrogen peroxide-based<br>
generator by reaction with a moiety of calcium, preferably CaOH to form the<br>
corresponding metal hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide, and calcium sulfate,<br>
calcium sulfate ½ hydrate and calcium sulfate di-hydrate (gypsum).<br>
It is an embodiment to recover the metal sulfate and/or bisulfate, most<br>
preferably sodium sulfate and/or sodium bisulfate, following the conversion of the<br>
halogen dioxide to a metal halate by reacting said metal sulfate and/or bisulfate with<br>
a moiety of calcium, preferably CaOH, to form the corresponding metal hydroxide,<br>
most preferably at least one of sodium, and calcium sulfate, calcium sulfate ½<br>
hydrate and calcium sulfate di-hydrate (gypsum). I is preferred that the metal(s) in<br>
said metal sulfate and/or bisulfate comprise a group IA or group IIA metal.<br>
Any possible chloride input to the peroxide-based process may ultimately<br>
exit the system with the chlorine dioxide produced in the methanol-based chlorine<br>
dioxide generator. However, the impact on the product purity should not be<br>
significant, especially when the production capacity of the latter process is much<br>
higher than that of the peroxide-based process.<br>
The combination of two halogen dioxide, preferably chlorine dioxide,<br>
generators permits all or part of the halogen dioxide containing condensate<br>
originating from the peroxide-based process to be forwarded to the chlorine<br>
dioxide absorption system associated with the methanol-based process. This<br>
embodiment is particularly beneficial since the need to remove the chlorine<br>
dioxide from the condensate is eliminated.<br>
Any suitable catalyst can be added to the peroxide-based chlorine dioxide<br>
generating process, if desired. It is understood that the chlorate ions required for<br>
the chlorine dioxide generation can be supplied not only by a group IA or IIA metal<br><br>
chlorate, preferably sodium chlorate, but also by chloric acid or mixtures thereof<br>
with said group IA or IIA metal chlorate. While the most preferred acid used in the<br>
process of the instant invention is sulfuric acid, any other strong mineral acid, such<br>
as perchloric acid, chloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid or the<br>
mixtures thereof can be employed.<br>
While any suitable reactor design can be used in the halogen dioxide<br>
formation step, a packed tower reactor is most preferred, wherein the halogen<br>
dioxide leaves the top of the tower after reacting with an aqueous phase of the metal<br>
halate, along with the other required reactants, as required by the method<br>
employed. It is an embodiment to form the halogen dioxide in a stirred vessel while<br>
capturing the halogen dioxide gas above; however, such a scenario without a packed<br>
tower may lead to loss of reactants and/or halide ions with the halogen dioxide.<br>
While any suitable reactor design can be used in the chlorite formation step, a<br>
packed tower reactor is most preferred, wherein the chlorite solution is recirculated<br>
and enters the reactor from the top. Hydrogen peroxide is added to the recirculation<br>
loop at a point prior to solution entry to the reactor. Sodium hydroxide and,<br>
optionally, dilution water is added at the bottom of the recirculation loop. The<br>
addition point of chlorine dioxide diluted with at least one inert gas, such as air,<br>
water vapor and nitrogen, is at the bottom of the reactor. The gas is passed counter-<br>
currently to the chlorite solution.<br>
The pH of the reaction medium is maintained generally in the range of<br>
about 11.8 to about 13.0, preferably about 12.0 to about 12.6. The hydrogen<br>
peroxide excess is maintained using a potentiometric (ORP) measurement. The<br>
ORP values, which are pH dependent, are generally maintained in the range of<br>
between about -30 to about -200 mV vs. Ag/AgCI, preferably about -40 to about -<br>
90mV vs. Ag/AgCI.<br>
Halide Acid - Metal Hydroxide - Metal Sulfoxy Salt Formation<br>
In the instant invention, both the halide acid and its associated metal<br>
hydroxide or metal oxide may be produced from the metal halide salt by electrolysis<br>
in the aforementioned EU. While sodium chloride is preferred, any metal halide salt<br>
may be used to form the associated halide acid and the associated metal hydroxide,<br><br>
preferably in solution. However, the halide acid is more economically formed by the<br>
reaction of the metal halide salt with a sulfoxy acid, preferably H2SO4, according to<br>
the SAP in an HAR. This reaction produces the halide acid, along with the<br>
corresponding metal salt, wherein the anion for said salt is a sulfoxy molecule,<br>
preferably at least one selected from a list consisting of a: sulfite, bisulfite, sulfate,<br>
bisulfate and any combination therein.<br>

HCI(g), and the associated byproduct salt is sodium in combination with at least one<br>
selected from a list consisting of a: sulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite and any<br>

potassium chloride as a metal halide in said HAR, wherein the associated acid<br>
product is HCI and the associated byproduct salt is potassium in combination with<br>
at least one selected from a list consisting of: sulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite<br>
and any combination therein.<br>
A preferred process embodiment utilizes about anhydrous or aqueous<br>
magnesium chloride as a metal halide in the EU, wherein the associated acid<br><br>
product is HCI and the associated caustic product is magnesium hydroxide. A<br>
more economical and most preferred process embodiment utilizes about<br>
anhydrous magnesium chloride as a metal halide in said HAR, wherein the<br>
associated acid product is HCI and the associated byproduct salt is magnesium in<br>
combination with at least one selected from a list consisting of: sulfate, bisulfate,<br>
sulfite, bisulfite and any combination therein.<br>

can easily be any metal in combination with any halide. It is preferred that the metal<br>
comprise at least one selected from a list comprising: Group IA metal, Group IIA<br>
metal, Group IIIB metal, Group VIII metal, Group IB metal, Group IIB metal, Group<br>

It is preferred to manufacture a group IA or group IIA metal hypohalite by the<br>
reaction of a group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide with a halide acid, wherein said<br>
halide acid is manufactured in an HAR from the reaction of a metal halide salt with a<br><br>
sulfoxy acid, thereby forming the corresponding group IA or group IIA metal sulfoxy<br>
salt along with the corresponding halide acid, and wherein said group IA or group IIA<br>
metal sulfoxy salt is then reacted with a group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide to<br>
form said group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide along with the corresponding group<br>
IIA sulfoxy salt in either an aqueous or hydrated form. It is most preferred that the<br>
unit forming said group IA or group IIA metal hypohalite by the reaction of a group<br>

halogen acid is manufactured in an electrolysis unit, wherein the electrical energy for<br>
electrolysis in said electrolysis unit is generated by the energy of formation of at least<br>
one selected from a list consisting of: SO2 from S and air, SO2 from S and O2, SO3 from<br>
SO2 and air, SO3 from SO2 and O2, said H2SO3 from SO2 and H2O; said H2SO4 from SO3<br>
and H2O; oleum from H2SO4 and SO3, said H2SO4 from oleum and H2O, and any<br>

IIA metal hydroxide, and a moist solid phase comprising said group IIA metal sulfoxy<br>
salt, said group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide and water.<br><br>
It is preferred to perform a separation of the aforementioned group IA or<br>

order to react said group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide aqueous solution with<br>
said halogen acid to form said group IA or group IIA metal hypohalite aqueous<br>
solution. It has been found that due to the specific gravity difference between an<br>
aqueous solution of a group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide and a calcium sulfoxy<br>
salt (or any group IIA metal sulfoxy salt) in combination with the inherent<br>
insolubility of a calcium sulfoxy salt (or any group IIA metal sulfoxy salt) with the<br>
inherent solubility of a group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide (again sodium is the<br>
most preferred metal), it is preferred to perform said separation by gravity<br>

that said vibration-type device have the ability to limit or minimize bridging of the<br>

It is most preferred to separate an aqueous solution of a group IA or group IIA<br>
metal hydroxide from said a group IIA sulfoxy salt, such that an aqueous solution is<br>

added to it the moist solids phase from a previous separation vessel, and wherein<br>
within or prior to said subsequent separation vessel water is added to the separated<br>
moist solids from said previous separation vessel, such that the concentration is<br>
lowered of said group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide in aqueous solution. It is<br>
preferred that the water concentration within the first separation vessel be controlled<br>
by the addition of water to at least one selected from a list consisting of: water to a<br>
lime slaker, water to calcium hydroxide, water to said first separation vessel, water to<br>
a group IIA metal other than calcium, and any combination therein.<br>
It is preferred to perform a water dilution of a moist solid phase from a<br>
separation thereby creating a mixture comprising said group IA or group IIA metal,<br>
water, a hydroxide and a solid, wherein said solid comprises a group IIA metal with<br>

mixture is less than previous, and wherein said aqueous solution is separated from<br>
said solid, such that an aqueous solution is obtained comprising a group IA or group<br>
IIA metal hydroxide, and a moist solid phase is obtained comprising said solid, said<br>
group IA or group IIA metal hydroxide and water.<br>
It is most preferred that the solids phase from a separation vessel be<br>

calcium sulfoxy salt dehydrate and any combination therein, herein referred to as<br>
gypsum product. (Again, calcium can be replaced with a group IIA metal.)<br>
As the solubility of calcium hydroxide in water is about less than 2,000 mg/L,<br>
depending upon temperature, there may be situations wherein it is preferred to<br>
remove soluble calcium, or any group IIA metal, from a group IA metal hydroxide<br>

hydroxide solution or said group IA metal hypohalite solution. Calcium carbonate,<br>
or group IIA metal carbonates, being soluble at only about 20 mg/L or less, will<br><br>
then form a precipitate leaving about less than 20 mg/L of calcium in solution with<br>
said group IA metal hydroxide. Said calcium carbonate is then preferably<br>

hypohalite by at least one selected form a list consisting of: an additional<br>

than 30 sec-1. However, as is known in the art of mixing and agitation, a high shear<br>
mixing scenario can be obtained by many means, including a centrifugal pump,<br>
homogenizer, reactor agitator or any physical system which combines the aqueous<br>
reactants in a situation of high kinetic energy contact, thereby creating a situation of<br>
high Reynolds Number of about greater than about 1,000 and preferably greater than<br>
about 2,000. It is a preferred embodiment to manufacture said MP by batch in a<br>
stirred tank reactor. It is most preferred to manufacture said MP in a plug flow or pipe<br>
reactor. It has further been found in the instant invention that high shear mixing<br>
energies lengthen the shelf life of the MP by as much as 100 to 500 percent. It is<br>
theorized that this increase is obtained due to a minimization on an atomic scale, of gel<br>
and thereby a minimization of available sites for gel to begin formation over time.<br>
A final MP product is prepared having a metal content, preferably comprising<br>
aluminum, of approximately 3-12 percent. A solid MP can be obtained by drying,<br>
wherein a product containing approximately 12 - 24 percent of aluminum is<br>
obtainable, whereby spray drying or rolling can be used as the drying method. A<br>
product containing aluminum and another metal(s) can be obtained, wherein the<br>
combined aluminum/other metal(s) concentration is less than or equal to<br>
approximately 12 percent if in solution or approximately equal to or less than 24<br>
percent if dried. A product containing at least one metal other than aluminum can be<br><br>
obtained, wherein the metal(s) concentration is less than or equal to approximately<br>
12 percent if in solution or approximately equal to or less than 24 percent if dried.<br>
There is no need to use an excess of aluminum or metal in the MPR, as with<br>
high shear mixing, the reaction has demonstrated near complete incorporation of<br>
aluminum. As is known in the art, a higher molar relationship can easily be<br>
increased by adding CaO, CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 whereby a molar relationship of 1.8 -<br>
1.9 can be obtained without increasing the reaction time to any considerable<br>
extent. In the case that one should want a further increase in the molar<br>
relationship OH:AI or OH:metal up to 2.5, metallic aluminum or metallic metal is to<br>
be added in the stoichiometric amount.<br>
It is preferred to manufacture an MP containing the sulfoxy moiety by<br>
incorporating a sulfoxy acid into the MPR under a situation of high shear mixing.<br>
It is a preferred embodiment there is no vehicular transportation of at least one<br>
selected fro a list consisting of said: halide acid, metal halide solution, sulfoxy acid, and<br>
any combination therein.<br>
It is preferred to manufacture said MP, as described herein along with<br>
obtaining steam from the formation of at least one selected from a list consisting<br>
of: SO2 from S and air, SO2 from S and O2, SO3 from SO2 and air, SO3 from SO2<br>
and O2, said H2SO3 from SO2 and H2O; said H2SO4 from SO3 and H2O; oleum from<br>
H2SO4 and SO3, said H2SO4 from oleum and H2O, and any combination therein. It<br>
is further an embodiment to create electricity from the energy of said steam as<br>
described previously in this instant invention.<br>
MAS (ACS Formation)<br>
It is an embodiment to react at least one metal other than aluminum into<br>
the MP; said metal(s) are to be preferably acidified prior to addition to the MPR.<br>
When any metal other than aluminum is reacted in the MP, said metal(s) needs<br>
to: form either a +2 or +3 valence state in said MAS, be prepared in their<br>
respective oxide or hydroxide form in either the +2 or +3 valence state prior to<br>
addition to the MPR or be capable of entering a +2 or +3 valence state in the<br>
MPR. While more than one metal other than aluminum can be entered into the<br>
MP and an MP can be manufactured with at least one metal other than aluminum,<br><br>
wherein no aluminum is used, in the instant invention it is preferred to maximize<br>
the use of aluminum and minimize the use of other metals due to the availability<br>
and cost of bauxite, alumina and aluminum. For particular applications, it may be<br>
preferred to choose a metal for that particular application; examples would<br>
include zirconium for antiperspirants, copper for algae control in water systems,<br>
tin as a sacrificial metal in corrosion control applications and gold, copper or silver<br>
for conductivity applications. MAS is, therefore, defined herein as at least one<br>
metal in halide acid solution wherein said metal(s) are in the +2 or +3 valence<br>
state in concert with at least one halogen in anionic form.<br>
MAS is formed from the aqueous reaction of a halide acid with a metal, metal<br>
salt, metal oxide or metal hydroxide, wherein said reaction with a metal, metal oxide<br>
and metal hydroxide is preferred. Aluminum halide solution (AHS) is formed from the<br>
reaction of the halide acid with at least one selected from a list consisting of: bauxite,<br>
an aluminum salt, aluminum, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide. The<br>
formation of MAS or AHS can occur in any vessel with agitation, such as a CSTR or a<br>
PFR. A vent scrubber is preferably to be placed on said reactor or downstream of said<br>
reactor to control emissions of hydrogen chloride gas (HCI(g)), or other halogen gas if<br>
a halogen acid other than HCI is used. A portion of the enthalpy from AHS or MAS<br>
manufacture can be utilized to decompose halite ions and/or provide heat to said MPR.<br>
AHS and/or MAS containing up to 5 percent aluminum can easily be prepared. AHS<br>
and MAS are easily prepared with the appropriate halide acid reacting with the chosen<br>
metal, metal salt, metal oxide or metal hydroxide.<br>
Alumina<br>
The purification of bauxite to alumina creates alumina for the preparation of<br>
aluminum halide solution (AHS), wherein ACS can be formed by reacting alumina<br>
with HCI. Purified bauxite, alumina, may also be required for MP production, in the<br>
MPR, if the raw bauxite contains any other heavy metal impurities and the resultant<br>
MP is to be used in drinking water purification or another application where heavy<br>
metal purity is an issue.<br>
It is preferred to provide steam to a portion of the metal hydroxide solution in<br>
order to perform the "Bayer" Refining Process (BRP), which can preferably proceed<br><br>
adjacent to the EU, thereby utilizing the enthalpy of electrolysis to minimize steam<br>
required in the BRP. While the BRP is most preferably used to purify bauxite, an<br>
alternate preferred method would be to utilize recycled aluminum metal, where the<br>
metal is purified in the BRP alone or with bauxite. If recycled aluminum is used, a<br>
portion of the halide acid production can be used to assist in the purification of the<br>
recycled aluminum or converting the aluminum to the associated aluminum halide<br>
acid, which is preferably ACS. A side stream of the hydroxide solution is preferably<br>
available to the MPR to assist in managing either the reactor pH or final MP basicity, as<br>
needed. Portions of the metal hydroxide solution are preferably sent to the haiide acid<br>
gas scrubbing system to pH-neutralize the liquid effluent and/or to the by-product<br>
metal stream to pH balance the final by-product metal sulfate, sulfite or bisulfite salt.<br>
Aluminum is provided for the MP or AHS with at least one selected from a list<br>
comprising: bauxite, alumina, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum metal and any<br>
combination therein. The aluminum metal can be refined or recycled. Should bauxite<br>
be used and NaOH or MOH from the EU be provided to refine the bauxite, the waste<br>
minerals from bauxite refining have many market uses, such as soils stabilization. It is<br>
most preferred to use alumina, aluminum or purified recycled aluminum in the<br>
preparation of AHS and MP because the acidification of bauxite, aluminum, aluminum<br>
oxides and aluminum hydroxides to AHS can also acidify any other metal impurities<br>
that may be present in recycled aluminum or bauxite, thereby allowing said metal<br>
impurities to react within the AHS and/or the final MP. In cases wherein heavy metal<br>
contamination is not an issue and/or the bauxite is pure enough from other earthen<br>
contaminants, both AHS and MP can be formed utilizing the raw bauxite. Any metal<br>
oxides that do not enter the MP complex can be used for soil stabilization.<br>
Energy<br>
The instant invention manages hazardous materials, heat energy, chemical<br>
energy, electrical energy, as well as investments in equipment and raw materials more<br>
effectively than previous processes, which focused primarily on formation of the<br>
polynucleate aluminum compounds and/or disinfectants. In contrast, the instant<br>
invention focuses on the processes of MP production and disinfectant production,<br>
incorporating methods to manage materials and energy not taught previously. Due to<br><br>
this management, the cost of manufacture of MP(s) and ACS, or any aluminum halide<br>
Solution (AHS) or metal halide solution (MAS), is much less than that previously. Due<br>
to this management, the cost of manufacture of a disinfectant and/or an oxidant is<br>
much less than that previously.<br>
The metal acid reactor (MAR) used to form AHS and/or MAS is also preferably<br>
placed near or adjacent to the EU and/or the HAR and preferably adjacent to the<br>
MPR so that the enthalpy of reaction to from MAS or AHS can be utilized in the MPR.<br>
It is preferred that the MPR and he MAR be the same equipment, e.g. the same<br>
vessel, such that in that same vessel: a) an aqueous solution of said halide acid is<br>
formed from the reaction of said halide acid in water, b) said metal halide solution is<br>
formed by the reaction of said metal(s) in said halide acid, and c) said polynucleate<br>
aluminum compound is formed by the reaction of said at least one metal(s) in said<br>
metal halide solution.<br>
The MPR is preferably adjacent or near the EU and/or the BRP so that the<br>
enthalpy of alumina formation can be utilized in the formation of MP(s). It is<br>
preferred that a vent scrubber be placed on the reactor to control halide acid gas<br>
emissions. The MPR may be equipped to operate at elevated temperature, pressure<br>
or both to form MP(s). It is preferred that the MPR be operated at approximately<br>
100 - 150 °C (212 - 3O2 °F); however, depending on the final product composition,<br>
the MPR can be operated between approximately 30 - 200 °C (86 - 381 °F). While<br>
higher temperatures allow for an increase in the reaction rate constant for MP<br>
formation, increases in MPR operating temperature require a corresponding increase<br>
in the operating pressure to maintain reactants in an aqueous solution (H2O, Al, OH,<br>
CI, etc.) Reactor pressure can be 1 to 7 atmospheres absolute, wherein 1 to 4<br>
atmospheres is preferred.<br>
Heat energy, enthalpy or temperature of matter, may be obtained from: SAR<br>
or SCAP; sulfoxy salt formation; calcium hydroxide formation; the electrolysis unit;<br>
formation of a calcium sulfoxy salt; pH adjustment; halogen dioxide formation; metal<br>
halate formation; metal halide acid formation, and halide acid formation. Energy will<br>
be required for bauxite purification to alumina, if bauxite is used and needs to be<br>
purified. Energy will be required for MP formation in the MPR. Energy will be<br>
required for recycled aluminum purification, if employed. Depending on production<br><br>
rates and the type of raw materials utilized, energy can be easily transferred from<br>
one reaction vessel to another (via heat transfer of water and/or steam, vessel water<br>
jacketing and vessel steam jacketing, or in the form of the product itself) so that<br>
there is maximal efficiency in the use of enthalpy from chemical reactions and usage<br>
as hot water and/or steam energy. For example, if larger quantities of AHS or MAS<br>
were required than could be used to provide heat for halite decomposition or to heat<br>
the MPR for MP production or to heat the Bayer Process for bauxite purification. For<br>
example, waste steam or low pressure steam can be used to heat sulfur to a molten<br>
state for ease of handling in and to the SACP.<br>
It is preferred that the energy from the formation of at least one selected<br>
from a list consisting of: SAR; bisulfate or bisulfite formation; calcium hydroxide<br>
formation; the electrolysis unit; formation of a calcium sulfoxy salt, pH<br>
adjustment, halogen dioxide formation, metal halate formation, metal AHS or MAS<br>
formation, halide acid formation, and any combination therein is used to heat<br>
water and/or steam. It is preferred that the heated water and/or steam is at least<br>
partially used to heat at least one selected from a list consisting of: the aqueous<br>
reaction of a metal halide solution with- a metal to form a polynucleate metal<br>
compound, the reaction of a metal hydroxide with a halide acid to form a metal<br>
hypohalite, heating and/or drying of a calcium sulfoxy salt, heating and/or drying<br>
of a group IA or a group IIA sulfoxy salt, and any combination therein.<br>
It is most preferred to manufacture at least one of: MP(s), AHS(s), hypohalites,<br>
halites, halates and halogen oxides without vehicular transportation of hazardous<br>
materials, which would include at least one selected from a list comprising: metal acid<br>
solution, halide acid solution, sulfuric acid and caustic.<br>

It is preferred that said metal sulfoxy salt and/or said gypsum product be<br>
used in wall-board, sheetrock, manufacture. It is most preferred that said metal<br>

sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, silicone sulfate, sodium carbonate,<br>
calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, aluminum carbonate, silicone carbonate,<br><br>
silica, silicates, sand, wax, glass, glass fiber, paper, adhesive, cement and any<br>
combination thereof to form a wall-board product. It is preferred that said sulfoxy<br>
salt, gypsum product or wallboard product be used in the manufacture of<br>
construction materials. It is most preferred that said construction materials<br>
comprise a wall-board or sheet-rock type product.<br>
It is an embodiment that said gypsum product is used in soil stabilization.<br>

Testing<br>
Bench scale tests reacting ACS in solution with aluminum hydroxide at a<br>
temperature of 110 - 140 °C (230 - 284 °F) for 1.5 to 5 hours, whereby the reaction<br>
of AlxCIY(OH)z is formed have been performed. The formation of ACS from aluminum<br>
metal was performed in one case and aluminum hydroxide was performed in the<br>
second case. In both cases, HCI was formed by the reaction of chlorine gas into<br>
water, where the water solution was heated continuously to 60 °C (140 °F) for 15<br>
minutes to assure complete chloride formation. In the third test, a portion of the<br>
aluminum hydroxide was replaced with MgO forming AlxMgwCIY(OH)z. In a fourth test,<br>
a portion of the ACS was replaced with MgCfe again forming AIXCIY(OH)Z. In a fifth<br>
test, a portion of the aluminum hydroxide was replaced with lime, CaO, forming<br>
AlxCawCly(OH)z. In a sixth test, sulfuric acid was added to the ACS forming<br>
AlxMgwClY(OH)z(SO4)v. In a seventh and poor-performing test, a portion of the ACS<br>
was replaced with ferric chloride. In an eighth test, a portion of the aluminum was<br>
replaced with copper forming AIXCUWCIY(OH)Z; this rather green product revealed a<br>
shelf life of over 2.5 years before forming a precipitate. In test nine, the ACS was<br>
replaced with a waste catalyst stream form Dow Chemical containing ACS. Test ten<br>
was a field coagulation test of the final MP made in Example "8." In an eleventh test,<br>
an MAS was prepared by dissolving CuCl3 in water, which was then reacted with MgO.<br>
In all cases, the relationship OH:AI or OH:metal in the resulting compound became 0.5<br>
to 1.5; where, this relationship is preferably greater than 1.2. In all cases the pH of<br>
the final solution was between 4.0 and 5.0. In all cases, improved results were<br>
obtained with high-shear mixing as compared to low. It was found that at high shear<br><br>
mixing energies, a greater proportion of the aluminum went into the MP and the<br>
tendency to form a gelatinous precipitate was reduced.<br>
In test twelve, salts were reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid. While<br>
ammonium is not a metal, a test was performed with ammonium chloride since the<br>
ammonium cation has "metal-like" qualities in salt formation. Even though the<br>
ammonium cation is not the most practical "metal-like" cation, given the results, the<br>
term "metal" in metal halides is to include "metal-like" moieties, preferably the<br>
ammonium cation. The test results are reviewed below:<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
At the time of this test, the city of Marshall, Texas was in drinking water<br>
production using CV 1703 as the coagulant. (CV is a registered trademark of<br>
ClearValue.) CV 1703 is a blend that is by volume: 38% CV 1120, 42% CV 1130,<br>
8% CV 3210 and 12% CV 3650. CV 1120 is an ACH measuring 23% Al2O3 at 84%<br>
basicity, CV 1130 is an ACS that measures 10% Al2O3, CV 3210 is a 50% active Epi-<br>
DMA solution that measures 100 +/- 20 cps, and CV 3650 is a 20% active diallyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium chloride polymer that measures 2000 +/- 200 cps. Prior to<br>
using CV 1703, Marshall utilized CV 3650 in concert with alum. Alum was, at that<br>
previous time, used at 30 to 35 ppm along with CV 3650 at 1.5 ppm.<br>
Marshall's raw water quality makes water purification difficult:<br>
-	The raw alkalinity is less than 20 ppm and often as low as 6 ppm,<br>
-	The raw turbidity is normally 2 to 7 NTU and infrequently 10 to 15 NTU,<br>
-	The raw color varies from 20 to 400 Apparent Color Units (ACU), and<br>
-	The raw TOC ranges form 5 to 20 ppm; and UV absorbance 0.2 to 0.7 m-1.<br>
Prior to the use of CV 3650 with alum, Marshall operated with just alum<br>
and often went out of US EPA and Texas State permit having a final water<br>
turbidity of greater than 0.5 NTU; on Alum operation, Marshall frequently<br>
measured in excess of 0.20 mg/L of aluminum in the final drinking water. While<br>
CV 3650 significantly improved alum operations, water color values of over 200<br>
ACU often required the use of CV 1703.<br>
Prior to using CV 1703, Marshall produced filtered water at a turbidity of<br>
near 0.15 to 0.30 NTU under normal operating conditions and higher when the<br>
raw water color was a challenge. During operation with CV 1703, Marshall has<br>
had the ability to keep the filtered water turbidity under 0.08 NTU under all<br>
operating conditions with the settled water turbidity varying from 0.4 to 0.7 NTU.<br><br>
Per US EPA guidelines, Marshall must remove, at times, 45% of the raw water<br>
TOC and, at times, 50% of the raw water TOC. During the year 2000, when the<br>
raw water had a lower organic content and nearly all of the raw TOC measured<br>
DOC per the standard industry test, Marshall was frequently unable to obtain 45%<br>
TOC removal. Operation during this time did not produce any final filtered water<br>
that had an aluminum concentration of over 0.20 mg/L.<br>
On 12/15/99, the MP made in Example 8 was jar-tested in comparison to CV<br>
1120 and CV 1703. On that day the raw color measured 55, NTU measured 4.1 and<br>
UV measured 0.185 m-1. At 15 ppm, CV 1703 obtained a settled turbidity of 0.96<br>
NTU, 14 ACU and 0.071 m-1. At 15 ppm, the MP from Example 8 obtained a settled<br>
turbidity of 0.69 NTU, 11 ACU and 0.074 m-1.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
To a 2-L beaker, 250 ml of water was added prior to 50 gm of CuCl2 X 6 H2O<br>
crystals; the solution was pH adjusted to 1.0 with HCI. The resulting solution was then<br>
mixed with 30 gm of MgO powder. The mixture was heated to 100 °C and stirred<br>
vigorously for four hours. The liquid was allowed to cool. The final product was clear<br>
with a greenish tint having a copper content of approximately 5 percent and a<br>
magnesium content of approximately 5 percent.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Five salt compositions are reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid to test the<br>
efficacy of halide acid formation and sulfate/bisulfite formation.<br>
In the first test, 4 gm of normal table salt (sodium chloride) is placed in a<br>

in the bottom of the beaker a solid precipitate forms which is obviously the<br>
ammonium sulfate salt-<br>
In the third test, 4 gm of CuCI3 X 6 H2O crystals are placed into a beaker<br>
containing 2 gm of concentrated sulfuric acid. In this test an aggressive reaction takes<br>
place, wherein HCI gas is obviously released due to the tell tale chlorine odor; in the<br>
bottom of the beaker a solid precipitate forms which is obviously copper sulfate.<br>
In the fourth test, 4 gm of AICI3 X 6 H2O crystals are placed into a beaker<br>
containing 2 gm of concentrated sulfuric acid. In this test an aggressive reaction takes<br>
place, wherein HCI gas is obviously released due to the tell tale chlorine odor; in the<br>
bottom of the beaker a solid precipitate forms which is obviously aluminum sulfate.<br>
In the fifth test, 4 gm of MgCI3 X 6 H2O crystals are placed into a beaker<br>
containing 2 gm of concentrated sulfuric acid. In this test an aggressive reaction takes<br>
place, wherein HCI gas is obviously released due to the tell tale chlorine odor; in the<br>
bottom of the beaker a solid precipitate forms which is obviously magnesium sulfate.<br>
