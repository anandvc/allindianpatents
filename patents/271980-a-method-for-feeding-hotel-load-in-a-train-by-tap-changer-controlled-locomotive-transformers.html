				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for feeding hotel load in a train by tap changer<br>
controlled locomotive transformers. More particularly the invention relates to a<br>
method for feeding hotel load in a train by tap changer controlled locomotive<br>
transformers. Controlled locomotive transformers that replaces an existing diesel<br>
generator set capsule used for hotel load by an electrical system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a conventional D.C. locomotive, a diesel generator set capsule is provided to<br>
feed the lighting, fan and catering load which are collectively known as "hotel<br>
load" in a train which is a requirement besides catering to the traction load.<br>
Owing to use of diesel, the environment becomes hazardous and the<br>
maintenance cost is high. There exist also chances of fire hazards. The space<br>
occupied by the whole set up is huge. Cost of running the set is also very high.<br>
For a run of 15 hours, to cater for a "hotel load" of 500KVA around 2000 litre<br>
diesel is consumed. Because of the Generator Set and its accessories, the<br>
temperature inside the locomotive is as high as 55Â°C.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need to overcome the disadvantages of prior art. The<br>
present invention replaces the use of diesel by electricity for the purpose of<br>
catering to hotel load. This use of electricity increases the efficiency of the<br>
locomotive and provides a cleaner environment. This also reduces the<br>
maintenance cost of the locomotive and chances of fire hazard inside the<br>
locomotive is reduced due to elimination of the diesel requirement of the Gen-Set<br>
Capsule required for Hotel load. The use of electricity also results in the<br>
reduction of the ambient temperature due to reduction in exhaust gas of the<br>
 <br>
locomotive. This invention also relates to generating more free space inside the<br>
locomotive and a scope for reduction in size of the locomotive.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a method for feeding hotel<br>
load in a train by tap changer controlled locomotive transformers which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a method for feeding hotel load in a<br>
train by tap changer controlled locomotive transformers which is capable of<br>
improving the efficiency of the locomotive.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a method for feeding hotel<br>
load in a train by tap changer controller locomotive transformers which reduces<br>
the maintenance cost of the locomotive.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a method for feeding hotel load in<br>
a train by tap changer controlled locomotive transformers which reduces the<br>
ambient temperature inside the locomotive.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a method for feeding hotel<br>
load in a train by tap changer controlled locomotive transformers which results a<br>
cleaner environment with more free space inside the locomotive and reduces<br>
chance of fire hazard.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
A locomotive transformer is a single phase transformer that draws power from<br>
one phase traction over head line ( 1 wire) with ground return through rails. The<br>
transformer is fed power at 25 Kv ( 27 kv at no-load) from the traction over<br>
head line. As shown in Fig. 1 the locomotive transformer has two transformers<br>
inside; one Regulating transformer (R) and one Main transformer (M). These two<br>
transformers are inter-connected in cascade arrangement i.e. the output of the<br>
Regulating transformer (R) is fed to the Main transformer (M).<br>
The first transformer is a Regulating transformer which is an Auto transformer<br>
that draws power from the over head line at terminal A 33. The secondary<br>
winding of the Regulating transformer (R) is divided into 32 parts as shown in<br>
Fig. 2. The 32 parts of the winding corresponds to 32 voltage steps i.e. the<br>
voltage output is different at different taps. There is a Tap changer to which all<br>
the 32 taps are connected in a progressively increased manner. At each tap<br>
 <br>
position the output voltage of the Regulating transformer (R) is different. The<br>
output of the Regulating transformer (R) (through Tap Changer) goes through<br>
terminal "Z" to the Main transformer (M) as shown in Fig. 2. The primary winding<br>
of the Regulating transformer is rated for 25 kV at 100% traction load. For<br>
example for a traction load of 3900 kVA of a locomotive the Regulating<br>
transformer is rated for ( 3900 KVA + Auxiliary load - if any) where the hotel<br>
load configuration is not provided.<br>
The output of the Regulating transformer (R) is fed on to the Main transformer<br>
(M). The main transformer is a fixed ratio transformer and caters to the traction<br>
purpose only. It has One primary traction winding (P1, P2) and two secondary<br>
windings (S1, S'1) and (S2, S'2). The primary winding is rated for 100% traction<br>
(traction load alone) and each secondary winding is rated at 760 volts at 50% of<br>
traction load capacity.<br>
For example, for a transformer of 3900 kVA traction load capacity will have a<br>
Main transformer with primary winding rated for 3900 kVA and each of the two<br>
secondary will be rated for a load of 1950 kVA.<br>
At different taps, the output of the Regulating transformer is different. This<br>
voltage is fed to the main transformer to give different voltage at its secondary<br>
winding, which are connected to the traction motors.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the main transformer and the Regulating transformer have a<br>
single magnetic circuit. The magnetic flux generated by the Regulating<br>
transformer finds a return path of the magnetic circuit of the Main transformer.<br>
From the regulating transformer the voltage fed to the Main transformer are<br>
different which results a proportionately variable magnetic flux of the main<br>
transformer. With change of tappings (tap positions 1 to 32) the voltage input to<br>
 <br>
Main transformer (increases) and hence the flux density in main transformer also<br>
(increases) proportionately.<br>
But the magnetic flux OR in the Regulating transformer does not change. This is<br>
because the input voltage from the Overhead line is fixed at 25 kv (27 kv at no-<br>
load). That means, whatever be the tap position (from 1 to 32), whatever may<br>
be the output voltage of the secondary winding (0 to 100% voltage) and<br>
whatever may be the speed of the train (even at Zero speed) the flux in the<br>
Regulating transformer always remains constant.<br>
So this winding, called as "Hotel Load Winding" has been provided on the<br>
magnetic path of the Regulating winding to generate an additional voltage<br>
source. The output of this winding is converted to D C by means of rectifiers.<br>
This D C power is utilized to take care of the Hotel load requirements inside the<br>
train. The rating of the Regulating transformer is increased by the hotel load<br>
winding capacity. For example, with a 1000 kVA Hotel load in a transformer with<br>
3900 kVA traction capacity, the rating of the Regulating transformer becomes (<br>
3900 + 1000 + Auxiliary load- if any). Inside the train normally a diesel<br>
generator is provided to generate D C power to take care of the Hotel load inside<br>
the train. For example, for a journey of 15 hours, to cater for a Hotel load of 500<br>
kVA, around 2000 liter of Diesel is required. By providing an additional winding in<br>
the magnetic path of the Regulating transformer of the train mounted locomotive<br>
transformer, a separate voltage source is developed. This voltage is independent<br>
of the tap position of the train and independent of the speed of the train. This<br>
voltage is converted to a D C source and utilized for Hotel load.<br>
 <br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for feeding hotel load in a train by tap changer controlled<br>
locomotive transformers comprising:<br>
drawing of power at for example 25 KV from the traction overhead line by<br>
regulating transformer (R);<br>

and S2-S'2) in the main transformer (M);<br>
connecting the secondary windings of main transformer (M) to traction<br>
motors;<br>
arranging a single magnetic circuit for both the regulating transformer (R)<br>
and main transformer (M);<br>
keeping the magnetic flux (OR) in the regulating transformer unchanged<br>
that generates additional voltage source; characterized in that this output<br>
being converted to D C by means of rectifiers wherein this D C power is<br>
utilized for hotel load.<br>
 <br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the magnetic flux (OR) in the<br>
regulating transformer remains constant for any position of tap, for any<br>
output voltage and for any speed of the train.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rating of the regulating<br>
transformer is increased by the hotel winding capacity.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the traction load is catered by<br>
the main transformer.<br>
<br>
The regulating transformer (R) which draws power at 25 KV from the traction<br>
overhead line is divided into 32 parts that corresponds to 32 voltage steps. The<br>
output of the regulating transformer is fed to main transformer (M) which has<br>
an arrangement of one primary winding (P1, P2) and two secondary winding (S1,<br>
S'1 and S2, S'2). A single magnetic circuit is arranged for both the transformers<br>
(R) and (M). The flux of the Main transformer changes with change of tappings.<br>
But the magnetic flux (Î¦R) in the regulating transformer (R) remains constant<br>
which generates additional voltage source for the Hotel load winding. Owing to<br>
the constant flux this voltage constant at all the speed (tap position) of the train.<br>
This voltage output is converted to D C by means of rectifiers and this D C power<br>
is utilized to meet the hotel load requirements.</td>
