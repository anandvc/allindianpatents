				<td>The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet with a rack which has horizontal and vertical frame profiles, the horizontal profiles forming a bottom and a top frame, the vertical frame profiles being attached in the corner areas of the bottom and top frame, and the vertical frame profiles being symmetrical to the cross-sectional diagonal extending through the virtual vertical outer edges of the rack.<br>
Such a switchgear cabinet is known for example from EP 0 533 555 Bl.<br>
The vertical frame profiles of such a switchgear cabinet have two inner walls directed towards the interior of the rack.  The inner walls are placed at right angles to one another, forming a vertical edge.  The edge projects from the frame profile and points into the interior.  In order to attach built-in assemblies, the inner walls are provided with attachment means.  The attachment means are spaced apart from one another at identical grid intervals.  In such frame profiles attachment is only-possible at the connection point predetermined by the grid interval.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a switchgear cabinet of the type already mentioned, with provides a high degree of variability for the attachment of built-in components.<br>
This object is achieved in that the vertical frame profiles, facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet, are provided with an open internal receiving means extending in the longitudinal direction of the profile, in that assembly rails may be inserted into the internal receiving means, in that there is respectively connected to the inner walls a profile side, which stands perpendicularly to the outer side of the rack, and in that the inner walls, the assembly rails and the profile sides are provided with rows of attachment means provided in a grid interval system.<br>
There may be incorporated in the internal receiving means an assembly rail, which can differ in the design of its row(s) of attachment means from the attachment means of the vertical frame profiles.  In particular, a different grid interval may be used.  Thus attachment points may be varied at will along the frame profile.<br>
In order to provide further possibilities of attachment for built-in components, the profile sides, next to the inner walls, are also provided with rows of attachment<br>
means.  In this way it is possible to provide a plurality of assembly planes.  Particularly when the inner walls, standing at right angles to one another, merge at right angles into the profile sides, there result at one side of the rack two assembly planes parallel to one another. Assembly rails may be attached one behind the other and parallel in these assembly planes.  Thus a plurality of possible attachments results.<br>
According to a preferred design of the invention, the vertical frame profiles merge at their profile sides into seal surfaces extending parallel to the side surfaces of the rack.  Side walls, a rear wall and/or a cabinet door may be applied in a sealed manner to these flat profile portions.  By means of using such seal surfaces a good sealing effect may be achieved.  In particular, HF-seals may be simply attached.<br>
The bottom and top frame can have in their corner areas receiving means open towards the outer side of the rack, which are formed by the end faces, abutting at right angles on one another, of the horizontal profiles.  The vertical frame profiles may be pushed into these receiving means.  Thus they abut directly on the end faces of the horizontal frame profiles.<br>
It is then not absolutely essential to use a separate corner connector, in order to connect the horizontal and vertical frame profiles together.  The support of the vertical frame profiles on the end faces of the horizontal frame profiles is sufficient alone to provide a secure connection.<br>
Provision may however also be made for corner connectors to be inserted in the receiving means in the bottom and of the top frame, and for the vertical frame profiles to be insertable horizontally into the receiving means and securable to the corner connectors.<br>
In this design of the switchgear cabinet it is always ensured that in the case of a completely assembled rack, a vertical frame profile may in addition be exchanged, even afterwards.  This need merely be released from the connectors and can then be extracted horizontally from the receiving means.  In the same way, the vertical frame profile may also be again horizontally inserted into the receiving means.  When the vertical frame profile is removed, the interior of the rack is easily accessible. Two vertical frame profiles can also be removed at will from one side of the rack.  The two remaining vertical frame profiles and the bottom or top frame alone form an independently standing unit, which is easily accessible for assembly purposes.<br>
A  possible variant of the invention is characterised in that the vertical frame profiles are provided with an external receiving means extending in the longitudinal direction of the profile, in that the external receiving means is formed by a wall which stands perpendicularly to the cross-sectional diagonal extending through the virtual outer side of the rack and in that two centering portions of the vertical frame profile are connected at an angle to the wall.<br>
Fittings, e.g. a door hinge, a closure system or side or rear wall attachments may be attached to the wall.  The centering portions in this case ensure that these attachment members are always aligned at their predetermined attachment points.<br>
In order to form a separate assembly unit, at least the vertical frame profiles of one side of the rack are combined by means of connector pieces to form a separate assembly unit.  This separate assembly unit may be fitted with electronic built-in components outwith the rack, and then may be mounted on the rack.<br>
The connector pieces in this case may be in the form of assembly rails, which have an assembly surface facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  The assembly surface<br>
is then more advantageously provided with at least one row of attachment means inserted at identical intervals.<br>
In order to reduce the outlay on parts, the bottom and top frame can preferably be identical in design.<br>
It is conceivable that the top frame may be fitted with a rain groove, through which water running down from the upper side of the switchgear cabinet may be removed in a controlled manner.<br>
In order simply to attach the assembly rail to the inner receiving means of the vertical frame profile, the assembly rail can have at least one profile arm with at least one plug-in receiving means, by means of which it may be thrust on to an attachment member.  In this case the attachment member can be attached as a separate part to the vertical frame profile.  When the assembly rail is thrust on to the attachment member, the latter is displaceable relative to the vertical frame profile in order to secure the assembly rail.<br>
Accordingly there is also provided a switchgear cabinet with a rack which has horizontal and vertical frame profiles, the horizontal frame profiles forming a bottom and a top frame, the vertical frame profiles being attached in the corner areas of the bottom and top frame, and the vertical frame profiles being symmetrical to the cross-sectional diagonal extending through the virtual vertical outer edges of the rack,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the vertical frame profiles are provided, facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet, with an open inner receiving means, extending in the longitudinal direction of the profile^<br>
in that vertical assembly rails may be inserted into the inner receiving means,<br>
in that there is connected to the inner walls a respective profile side which stands vertically to the outer side of the rack, and<br>
in that the inner walls, the assembly rails and the profile sides are provided with rows of attachment means inserted at a grid interval.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the accompanying drawings:<br>

Figure 7: the rack according to Figure 2 with a side wall, and<br>
Figure 8: the rack according to Figure 2 with a cabinet door.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rack for a switchgear cabinet.  The rack is substantially made up of a bottom frame, a top frame 10 and of four vertical frame profiles 30.  The vertical<br>
frame profiles 30 connect the bottom frame 10 to the top frame 10.  The bottom and top frames 10 are identical in construction, so that they can be interchanged with one another.<br>
The bottom and top frames 10 respectively have two horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 extending in the direction of the depth of the switchgear cabinet and of the width of the switchgear cabinet.  These horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 are provided on their profile sides facing the interior of the rack with rows of attachment means 37.  Located between the individual attachment means 37 are thread receiving means 37.1.  The vertical frame profiles 30 also are provided with attachment means 37 or thread receiving means 37.1 facing the interior of the rack.  Assembly rails, for example, as shown in more detail in Figure 6, may be attached to the attachment means 37.  The vertical frame profiles 30 are connected by connectors 14 to the bottom or top frame 10.  The connectors 14 are located in the area of corner receiving means 20 of the bottom or top frame 10.  The vertical frame profiles 30 are attached to the connector 14, for example by means of welding.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative attachment of the vertical frame profiles 30 to the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12.  The receiving means 20 are formed on the ends<br><br>
abutting on one another of the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12.  The connectors 14 are inserted into the receiving means 20.  The connector 14 is substantially parallelepipedic in shape.  At its vertical ends however it is provided with an oblique surface 19, into which are inserted one or a plurality of thread receiving means 14.1.  The oblique surface 19 faces the outer side of the rack.  In order to attach the connector 14, the latter is mounted on the support surface 20.1.  By means of its contact surfaces 16 facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet, it abuts on the terminal ends of the horizontal profiles 12.  In this position the connector 14 can be welded into the receiving means 20.  Thus the connector 14 is located precisely at right angles to the associated horizontal frame profiles 11, 12.  The terminal ends of the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 and the support surface 24 form a receiving means, open outwards, for the terminal end of the vertical frame profile 30.  The vertical frame profile 30 has an open internal receiving means 35.1 facing the interior of the rack.  The internal receiving means 35.1 is defined by two internal walls 33, 34 of the vertical frame profile 30.  The internal walls 33, 34 extend in a plane in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile 30.  They stand at right angles to one another.<br>
With the vertical frame profile mounted, the internal walls 33, 34 abut on stops 17, 18 of the connector 14. Profile sides 31, 32 connect at right angles with the internal walls 33, 34 to the vertical frame profile 30. These profile sides 31, 32 come to rest at the terminal ends of the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12.  In order to attach the vertical frame profiles 30, one or a plurality of screw receiving means 38 are inserted in the area of their terminal ends.  These screw receiving means 38 may be located flush with the thread receiving means 14.1 of the connector 14.  In order to simplify assembly, the space between the terminal end of the frame profile 30 and the centre of the bore of the screw receiving means 38 is co-ordinated with the spacing between the support surface 24 and the thread receiving means 14.1. An attachment screw 39 can be passed through the screw receiving means 38 and screwed into the thread receiving means 19 of the connector 14.  In this way the internal walls 31, 34 can be clamped to the stops 17 and 18 of the connector 14. Simultaneously, the vertical frame profile 30, at the terminal ends of the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12, can be drawn into the receiving means 20.  In its final assembled position, the vertical frame profile 30 is securely connected to the connector 14 and exactly vertically aligned.  The drawing clearly shows that the vertical frame profile 30 can be inserted from the outer side of the rack into the receiving means 20.  Thus the<br>
vertical frame profiles 30 can also be dismantled or assembled subsequently after assembly of the rack is complete.  This has the decided advantage that the interior of the rack can be rendered easily accessible. For example, an independent free standing unit comprising bottom and top frame 10 and the two rear vertical frame profiles 30 can be constructed.  This independent free standing partial rack can be fitted with electronic components or the like.  Then the two forward vertical frame profiles 40 can be assembled, so that the rack is completed.<br>
Figure 3 shows a portion of a rack.  In this case the two vertical frame profiles 30 of one side of the rack are combined by means of connector pieces 40 to form an assembly unit.  The two connector pieces 40 are in this case in the form of assembly rails.  These assembly rails are U-shaped in cross-section and are formed from an assembly surface 41 and two side portions 42, 43 connecting therewith.  The side portions 42, 43 are parallel to one another.  The assembly surface 41 faces the interior of the rack.  An attachment section 45 is respectively connected at its end laterally to the assembly to the assembly surface 41.  The attachment section 45 is in the form of a tab, which partly covers over the associated inner wall 34 of the vertical frame profile.<br>
As indicated in the drawing, the connector piece 40 with the vertical frame profiles 30 can be screwed above the attachment section 45.  Electronic components can be secured to the connector pieces 40.  For this purpose attachment means 44a, 44b can be provided in the assembly-surf aces 41 and the side portions 42, 43.  The attachment means 44a, 44b are arranged in lines and are at a uniform interval apart relative to one another.  The interval is co-ordinated with the interval spacing of the attachment means 37 of the vertical frame members.<br>
In the assembly unit shown in the drawing, connector pieces 40 are provided in the upper and lower area of the vertical frame profiles 30.  However, more than two connector pieces 40 may be used, in order to form the assembly unit.  In particular, cross braces may also be used, which are inserted obliquely between the two vertical frame members 30.  In order to mount the assembly unit on the base unit 10, the latter is pushed in in its vertical adjusting position into the receiving means 20.  In this case, firstly the vertical frame members 30 are mounted with their end faces 36 on the support surface 24 of the bottom frame 10.  Then the complete assembly unit is inserted in the direction opposite to the arrows shown in the drawing into the receiving means 20.  The inner walls 34 of the vertical<br>
frame profiles 30 slide along the associated stops 18 of the corner connector 14.  These stops 18 now serve as guides.  The insertion movement is limited with the profile side 32 of the vertical frame profiles 30.  These come to rest on the end faces of the horizontal frame profiles 11.  At the same time the inner wall 34 abuts on the stops 17 of the connector 14.  Provided between the two stops 17 and 18 of the corner connector 14 is a bevelled flank 19.  This latter projects into the internal receiving means 35.1 of the vertical frame profiles 30.  Formed between the flank 19 and the base surface of the internal receiving means 35.1 is a free space.  This free space ensures that the vertical frame profiles 30 always abut only with their inner walls 33, 34 on the stops 17, 18.  In this way the assembly unit may be aligned exactly on the bottom unit 10.  For securing, the assembly unit is screwed to the bottom frame 10.  The type of screwing of the vertical frame profiles 30 to the corner connectors 40 can be seen from Figure 2.  It is however also possible to weld the vertical frame profiles direct with the bottom frame 10 and the corner connector 14.  In addition to the bottom frame 10, the preferably identically designed top frame 10 is used.  The top frame 10 is connected in the upper area to the vertical frame profiles 30.  The rack may then be completed by further vertical frame profiles 30.<br>
The assembly unit is more advantageously located on the rear side of the switchgear cabinet.  It is however also possible to provide the assembly unit at one side of the rack.  In the assembly unit there are a plurality of possible attachments.  In particular, the internal walls 33, 34 or the profile sides 31, 32 of the vertical profiles 30 associated with one another in pairs, can be used to form two assembly planes offset parallel to one another.  The first assembly plane is shown in part by the assembly surfaces 41 of the connector pieces 40 in the drawing.  Such offset assembly planes may also be provided perpendicularly to the assembly unit in the rack.  For this purpose the attachment means 37, 37.1 of the internal walls 33 or of the profile side 31 are used.<br>
In order to avoid risk of injury, the support surfaces 24 of the receiving means 20 are provided with a profiling 21.  In this case the profiling 21 is adapted to the external geometry of the vertical frame profiles 30. Thus there are no projecting edges of the bottom unit beyond the vertical frame profiles.<br>
Figure 4 shows a bottom frame 10, made up of horizontal frame profiles 11, 12, in a detailed view.  The horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 have the same cross-sectional geometry.  The entire bottom frame 10 is built up from four horizontal frame profiles 11, 12, as can<br>
already be seen from Figure 1.  In order to produce the bottom frame 10, a single stamped, bent part may be used, so that the individual horizontal frame profiles, 11, 12 are integrally connected together.  The horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 have a horizontal inner wall 25, connecting with which is a folded-over portion 26 angled downwards through 90°.<br>
The folded-over portion 26 serves for contact with a side wall 63 (for example according to Figure 7) or a cabinet door 72 (for example according to Figure 8).  A seal member may be inserted between the side wall 63 or the cabinet door 72 and the folded-over portion 2 6 in order to provide a seal.  Bent backwards at right angles from the folded-over portion 26 is a horizontal web 27.1. This web 27.1 merges into the downwardly-aligned wall 27. In the free space formed for the web 27.1 of the wall 27, a folded portion of the side wall 63 or of the cabinet door 72 can be accommodated.<br>
The wall 27 is terminated by a base portion 28.  The bottom frame 10 can at this point be set on the base.  At the terminal ends, the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 are provided on their webs 27.1 with the profiling 21. The profiling 21 in this case is again adapted to the external geometry of the vertical frame profile 30. Spaced apart in a vertical direction from the web 27.1,<br>
at the ends, there are on the inner walls 25 terminal stops 22, 23 for the vertical frame profile 30.<br>
The connector 14 is inserted into the receiving means 20. The connector 14 in this case stands on the base portion 28.  Laterally it abuts on the walls 27.  The horizontal frame profiles 11, 12 may be connected, for example welded to the connector 14.  This serves to stiffen the bottom/ top frame 10.<br>
The vertical frame profile 30 has an outer receiving means 35.2 formed as a wall, which is aligned towards the outer side of the rack.  Two hollow chambers extend on either side of the wall.  In order to form the hollow chamber the sheet metal blank for the vertical frame profile is folded over a number of times.  Specifically, there connects with the wall a centering portion 30.1, which merges via a transitional piece 30.2 into an angled portion 30.3.  The angled portion 30.3 is located vertically to the associated sides of the rack. Connecting with the angled portions 30.3 at right angles are the seal surfaces 30.4.  In order to form the profile sides 31, 32, the seal surfaces 30.4 are bent over at right angles in the direction of the interior of the rack.  The profile sides 31, 32 merge at right angles into the inner walls 33, 34.  Thus the inner walls 33, 34 stand parallel to the associated sides of the rack.  The<br>
inner walls 33, 34 abut via bent-over terminal pieces on the wall, which forms the external receiving means 35.2. Between the two inner walls 33, 34 there arises the inner receiving means 35.1 which is oriented towards the interior of the rack.<br>
The vertical frame profile 30 is pushed into the externally open receiving means 20 of the bottom frame 10.  Thus the profile sides 31, 32 slide along to the stops 22, 23 of the horizontal frame profiles 11, 12. With its end face 36, the vertical frame profile 30 stands terminally on the support surface 24 of the bottom frame 10.  In this position the vertical frame profile 30 is aligned at its profile sides 31, 32.  Thus also the inner walls 33, 34 are positioned relative to the interior of the rack.<br>
The exact vertical alignment of the frame profile 30 is possible by means of the profiling 21.  As this latter is adapted to the external geometry of the vertical frame profile 30, it may be applied flush at this point.<br>
Figure 5 shows in more detail how an assembly rail 50 can be attached to one of the vertical frame profiles 30. Only a portion of the vertical frame profile 30 is shown in the drawing in Figure 5.  The assembly rail 50 has a length corresponding to this portion.  This view shows<br>
that the assembly rail 50 may be attached in sections at any points along the vertical frame profile.<br>
Naturally, the assembly rails 50 used may be varied in their length.  They may particularly extend over the entire axial length of the vertical frame profiles 30.<br>
The assembly rail 50 is square in cross-section.  This cross-section is formed by two assembly sections 52, 53 and two profile sections 51, 54 connected to one another at right angles.  The profile sections 51, 54 are respectively bordered by the free ends of the assembly sections 52, 53.  Thus there is formed a hollow profile which is open in the area between the profile sections 51, 54.  Assembly receiving means 56, 57 are produced in the assembly sections 52, 53.  Stamped out on the profile sides 51, 54 are attachment holes 55, 58.  The assembly receiving means 56, 57 and the attachment holes 55, 58 are located relative to one another at identical intervals.  The attachment holes 55, 58 in this case are so arranged that they are flush with an assembly receiving means 56, 57 of the assembly section standing parallel to the respective profile section.  The attachment holes 55, 58 are thus accessible via the assembly receiving means 56, 57.  In order to attach the assembly rail 50 to the vertical frame profile 30, plug-in receiving means 59 are produced in the profile sides<br>
51, 54.  The plug-in receiving means are slot-shaped and are open towards the free vertical end of the profile sections 51, 54.  In the present case, one plug-in receiving means 59 is used per profile section 51, 54. in order to secure the assembly rail 50, firstly an attachment member 39.1 is screwed into a thread receiving means 37.1 in the vertical frame profile 30.  It may be optionally selected in which of the inner walls 33, 34 of the frame profile 30 the attachment member 39.1 (known as a screw in the following), is screwed in, and this is determined substantially by accessibility.  The assembly rail 50 is thrust with its plug-in receiving means 59 of the profile section 54 on to the bolt section of the screw.  This thrust-on movement is symbolised by the arrow shown in Figure 5.  When the assembly rail 50 is thus attached to the frame profile 30, it is pre-positioned.  By means of an assembly receiving means 56 of the assembly section 52 located flush with the plug-in receiving means 59, the screw is accessible at its screw head by a tool.  When the screw is turned further into the thread receiving means 39.1, the screw head clamps on the profile section 51.  The assembly rail 50 is drawn into the inner receiving means 35.1 of the frame profile 30.  The two profile sections 51, 54 then abut on the inner walls 33, 34.  The assembly rail 50 is precisely aligned on the frame profile 30.  For additional attachment, screws may be passed through into the<br>
individual assembly receiving means 56, 57, in which attachment holes 55, 58 are produced and can be screwed into the respectively associated thread receiving means 37.1.  Depending on the type and magnitude of the stress acting on the assembly rail 50, one or more additional attachment members 39.1 may be used.<br>
Figure 6 shows how assembly rails 40 can be attached to two vertical frame profiles 30.  The assembly rails 40 substantially correspond to the assembly rails 40 as shown in Figure 3.  It should be made clear again at this point how two different assembly planes located parallel to one another can be formed on the frame profiles 30 according to the invention.  As already mentioned, the assembly planes are provided by the assembly surfaces 41 of the assembly rails 40.<br>
Figure 7 shows how attachment member 60 may be attached to the outer receiving means 35.2 of the vertical frame profiles 30.  The attachment members 60 have two attachment points with thread bores 61.  Screws 62 are used to attach side walls 63.  These screws 63 are thrust through bores in the side walls 63 and are screwed into the thread bore 61 of the attachment members 60.  Thus the side wall 63 abuts in a sealed manner with its inner side on the seal surface 30.4 of the vertical frame profile 30.  The attachment members 60 shown in Figure 7<br>
may be used to attach two side walls 63 standing at right angles to one another to the rack.<br>
Figure 8 shows how hinge parts 70 can be attached to the outer receiving means 35.2.  In order to provide hinges on a cabinet door 72, further hinge portions 7 6 are attached on the door leaf.  These further hinge portions 7 6 can be connected to the hinge portions 70.  Applied to the inner wall of the cabinet door 72 is a seal 74.  The seal 74 abuts in a sealed manner on the seal surface 30.2 of the vertical frame profiles 30.  The view in Figure 8 shows that the hinge portion 70 carries a thread bore 71 on one side wall attachment.  Thus one side wall can be attached to the hinge portion 70 at right angles to the front side of the rack.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
