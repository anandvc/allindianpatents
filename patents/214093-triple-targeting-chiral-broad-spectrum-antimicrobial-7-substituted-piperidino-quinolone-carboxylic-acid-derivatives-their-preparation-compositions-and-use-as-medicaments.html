The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
26-6-2006<br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to novel antimicrobial 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Methods of preparation of the compounds of the invention, compositions of compounds of the invention and their use are also described.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The fluoroquinolone group of antibiotics available since the early 1960s are valuable as antibacterial agents. There have been synthesized, developed and marketed quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives having various chemical structures. Nalidixic acid, the progenitor of the series, was used primarily as a urinary tract antiseptic. Later development provided agents with broader activity, increased potency against selected pathogens and improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.<br>
From a medical utility viewpoint, the quinolones are classified as first-, second-, and third-generation compounds (Gootz T D et al, Chemistry &amp; Mechanism of Action of the Quinolone Antibacterials. In Andriole VT ed. The Quinolones, San Francisco, Academic Press, 1998, 28-80). First-generation compounds like piromidic acid and pipemidic acid provided coverage for gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. The second-generation compounds are divided into those with enhanced but predominant gram-negative activity, against pathogens like Escherischia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those with balanced broad-spectrum activity (norfloxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, rufloxacin, nadifloxacin). Norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have, therefore, been used mainly for treatment of diseases including urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, sexually transmitted diseases and the like. Third-generation drugs (levofloxacin, pazufloxacin, sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin, sitafloxacin, trovafloxacin, tosufloxacin, temafloxacin, grepafloxacin, balofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin) are those with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci (notably clinafloxacin, sitafloxacin, trovafloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and, for essentially all the third- generation quinolones, activity also against gram-negative Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella<br><br><br>
pneumophila, and against anaerobes and atypical pathogens (Ball P, The Quinolone. History and Overview. In Andriole VT ed. The Quinolones, San Francisco, Academic Press, 1998, 1-28). Levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin have, therefore, found use for community-acquired infections such as those of the upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTI) like pneumonia, sinusitis and pharyngitis, and for skin and soft tissue infections (SSI) caused by gram-positive strains of staphylococci, pneumococci, streptococci and enterococci.<br>
The improvements seen in most of the third-generation drugs in current use are generally attributed to their uniqueness in inhibiting the bacterial targets, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Three categories of quinolone inhibition have been suggested. Type I quinolones (norfloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin) indicated a preference for topoisomerase IV inhibition. Type II quinolones (nadifloxacin and sparfloxacin) indicated a preference for DNA gyrase inhibition. Type III quinolones to which some of the third-generation quinolones belong (gatifloxacin, pazufloxacin, moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin) display, however, a dual-targeting property, and equally influence DNA gyrase inhibition and topoisomerase IV inhibition. (Takei M et al, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 2000; 45:3544-49). DNA gyrase is the primary target in bacteria, and thus is explained the weaker activity in gram-positive bacteria of the preferred topoisomerase IV-targeting second-generation quinolones like norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin. The unusual activity of nadifloxacin described by others, and further significantly elaborated for S-(-)-nadifloxacin by us (cf: our pending US application Nos. 09/566,875, WO 00/68229 [Indian application No. IN/PCT/01/01369], 09/850,669, [USP 6,608,078, Indian application No. IN/PCT/02/01549] and WO 01/85728), specially against gram positive S. aureus, is now better understood in view of its being shown to be DNA-gyrase targeting, which is the first such report for a quinolone in S. aureus (Oizumi N et al, J . Infect. Chemother, 2001; 7: 191-194). Some, but not all, third generation quinolones being primarily topoisomerase IV-targeting in gram-positive staphylococci, and DNA gyrase-targeting in gram-positive S. pneumoniae, explains the advantages provided by the dual-targeting third-generation quinolones like moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin.<br>
The evolution of quinolones from first-generation to second-generation to third-generation compounds has also been guided by structure-activity relationship studies. It has been<br><br>
determined by those in the art that certain structures with specific sites on the quinolone ring functionalised have distinct advantages over others. Structure-activity relationships of the quinolones have been the subject of detailed study for more than a decade (Asahina Y et al, Recent Advances in Structure Activity Relationships in New Quinolones, Prog. Drug Res., 1992, 38, 57-106) As a result of these studies, it has been determined by those in the art that certain structures, with specific sites on the quinolone ring functionalised, have distinct advantages over others. The structural feature that remains constant throughout the drug class is the bicyclic aromatic core consisting of 2 fused 6-membered rings. This core can contain a carbon at the 8-position, yielding a true quinolone, or a nitrogen which provides a ring system technically termed a naphthyridone, or an additional fused ring across the N-l and C-8 positions yielding tricyclic heterocycles, such as pyridobenzoxazines and benzoquinolizidines.<br>
In the context of the current invention, the nature of the amine group at the 7-position takes on special relevance. It is notable that in the cited second-generation quinolones the piperazine ring remains relatively constant and undisturbed as a 7-substituent, except for alkylation on the distal nitrogen, or less frequently on the ring carbons. In the third-generation quinolones, the continuing trend of use of a C-7 cyclic amino group is also almost universal. The presence of a second amine, in addition to the nitrogen bonded to C-7 of the quinolone nucleus has been found to be important. However, amongst these new quinolones, too, the frequent employment of mainly a C-7 piperazino or pyrrolidino variant is to be noted, but with only one example of a C-7 piperidino substituent.<br>
Only two of the above-cited quinolones, the second-generation nadifloxacin and the third-generation balofloxacin, have a C-7 piperidino substituent. Nadifloxacin with a hydroxypiperidine substituent at the C-7 position is notable for its being the sole marketed modern quinolone without a distal amino group, but is merely a topical agent. Balofloxacin has an unusual 3-methylaminopiperidino substituent, which is, however, said to be the contributing element to its lower activity against Enterobacteriaceae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Among the recent fluoroquinolones which have been introduced commercially are moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. Both these antibacterial agents have an 8-methoxy substituent in the fluoroquinolone core. As 7-substituents in the core, there is for moxifloxacin a bicyclic pyrollidine as the amino mdiety, and for gatifloxacin a substituted<br><br>
pyrollidine as the amino moiety. A more recently described olamufloxacin, which has been shown to have activity in murine models of system infections and urinary tract infections, has an 8-methyl substituent in its fluoroquinolone core in which the C-7 substituent is also a substituted pyrollidine. No commercially introduced fluoroquinolone or one that has commercial potential is known in which a piperidino group, substituted or unsubstituted, is introduced at the 7-position of the quinolone structure also having a methoxy group or methyl group at the 8-position.<br>
Since the 1960s, in an enormous worldwide effort, well more than 10,000 structurally- related fluoroquinolone agents have been described in many hundreds of patents and journal articles. Despite the understanding of the need of a cyclic amine at the C-7 position, the prior art appears to have discounted the value of having a piperidino moiety, unsubstituted or substituted, as a C-7 substituent.   For instance, a 1992 review article (Asahina Y et al, vide infra) indicates the comparative low prior art interest in C-7 piperidino substituents, wherein there are only 21 piperidino moieties cited in comparison to 188 piperazino moieties, and 74 pyrollidino moieties out of a total of 578 C-7 amino moieties.<br>
Just as there are structure-activity relationships, there are also structure-side effect relationships that have been determined. Side effects and adverse events related to N-l, C-5, C-8 variants of the quinolone core are generally those that contribute to increase in theophylline interactions, clastogenicity, phototoxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, arthropathy and tendonitis. Notable is the pattern of (a) the N-l cyclopropyl and C-8 fluorine, chlorine or methoxy substituted quinolone reported to show heightened cytotoxicity (Domagala J M, J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 1994; 33: 655-706), which can be modulated, however, by further structural manipulation (Gootz T D et al, vide infra), (b) the presence of halogen atoms (fluorine or chlorine) at the C-8 position (sparfloxacin, clinafloxacin) enhancing the tendency to induce photosensitivity, (c) the N-l difluorophenyl substituent in trovafloxacin and temafloxacin associated with hepatotoxicity and hemolytic anemia and (d) the C-5 methyl (grepafloxacin) and C-8 methoxy substituent (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin) contributing to prolongation of the QT interval and the development of a form of ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes.<br>
As important, if not more so, than the above-mentioned substituents of the fluoroquinolone core is the amine substituent at the C-7 site. C-7 pyrrolidines tend to show increased<br><br>
cytotoxicity over piperazino substituents, with the combination of 3-substituted pyrrolidines at C-7 and halogens at C-8 providing the most cytotoxic compounds.(Suto N J et al, J Med Chem 1992; 35:4745-50; Mundell L A et al, Clin Infect Dis, 2001; 32(Suppl): S74) In the second most frequently encountered form of quinolone toxicity, namely adverse events involving the CNS, it is the unsubstituted piperazines which correlate best with the degree of GABA-binding inhibition, closely followed by the pyrrolidinyl quinolones.<br>
The incremental improvements that have resulted in moving from first- to second- and third-generation quinolones are a consequence of the understanding of the modulation brought about by a combination of a fluoroquinolone core moiety with a C-7 amino substituent. Although certain substituents can impart improvements, whether on one hand in antibacterial potency or on the other in a minimised potential for adverse effect, it is the overall characteristics of each molecule derived from the interaction of all the substituents with each other and with the specific nucleus employed that brings newer gains.  Furthermore, characteristics in addition to those of activity and side effects are central to the development of improved human theraputants such as selective molecular mechanisms of action, broader antibacterial coverage to include anaerobes, atypical and resistant pathogens, improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and devoid of class-identified toxicity features.<br>
It is, thus, clear that the art has focussed on identifying new quinolones to progress from earlier generation compounds to the next generation compounds. Despite the progress made, the full promise of the quinolones has not yet been exploited.<br>
Examples of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotic therapy have been reported in the past; they are now a significant threat to public health in the developed world. The development of microbial resistance is of increasing concern in medical science. "Resistance" can be defined as existence of organisms, within a population of a given microbial species, that are less susceptible to the action of a given antimicrobial agent. This resistance is of particular concern in environments such as hospitals and nursing homes, where relatively high rates of infection and intense use of antibacterials are common. Recent international conferences in 2002 on infectious diseases organised by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, World Health Organisation and other groups have highlighted emerging infectious<br>
diseases, in which the word "emerging" refers to newly discovered infectious diseases or old ones that have rebounded, turned up in new places, or become drug resistant.<br>
The mechanisms of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones is generally believed to function by two principal categories, both resulting from chromosomal mutations (DC Hooper, Drug Resis Updat 1999; 2:38-55). One category is the alterations in drug target enzymes. Fluoroquinolone resistance mutations generally occurring stepwise have been localized to specific regions of the parC and parE genes (grlA and grlB in S. aureus) encoding topoisomerase IV, and the gyrA and gyrB genes encoding DNA gyrase. This clustering of mutations has defined the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of these genes that are in proximity to the apparent enzyme active site and are thought likely to constitute a domain at which quinolones interact directly with the enzyme-DNA complex. The manner by which the emergence of resistant mutants can be prevented is receiving attention, but is as yet insufficiently understood and continues to be speculative. Studies with the C-8 methoxy fluoroquinolones bearing a C-7 unsubstituted or 3-alkyl substituted piperazino substituent provide support to the concept that attack of both gyrase and topoisomerase IV equally would be ideal. In cases where single point mutation already exists, then a quinolone that would preferably potently inhibit the primary more essential target, whether gyrase or topoisomerase IV, would be better to prevent the resistance (Zhao et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. 1997; 94: 13991-13996). No similar study, to our knowledge, is available for compounds with a C-7 piperidino substituent, whether unsubstituted or substituted, in any quinolone core. The second category for bacterial resistance to develop is alterations that limit permeation of drug to the target. In S. aureus the elevated expression of the norA gene is responsible for efflux-mediated resistance to quinolones. Factors influencing the decrease in activity of quinolones in efflux-mediated resistant mutants of S. aureus have been suggested not to be hydrophobicity of the whole quinolone molecule, but rather the bulkiness at the C-7 substituent, and bulkiness and hydrophobicity at the C-8 substituent (Takenouchi T et al, 1996; 40:1835-42). Only two of forty quinolones included in this analysis bore a C-7 amino-substituted piperidino substituent. The effect of efflux was more pronounced with the compound bearing the 4-amino substituted piperidino substituent, its MIC value being 8 times more with an efflux pump-bearing strain than with a non-efflux pump-bearing strain, as compared with a 2 times more value for the 3-amino substituted piperidino substituent. Surprisingly, unlike this precedent, the present invention shows that appropriately substituted<br><br><br>
4-amino piperidine substituents on different fluoroquinolone cores display potent efflux pump inhibitory/uptake facilitatory properties.<br>
Stereochemistry-activity relationships are also of importance in considerations regarding the advancement of quinolones that can exist as isomers. For instance, S-(-)-levofloxacin, as an example of a compound in which the chiral centre is close to the quinolone nucleus, is from 8-128 fold as potent as the R-(+)-enantiomer. Earlier work and our pending US patent application Nos. 09/566,875 and 09/850,669, WO 00/68229 and WO 01/85728 on nadifloxacin, which like levofloxacin has a relatively similar chiral centre, also disclose the superior profile of S-(-)-nadifloxacin over the R-(+)-enantiomer. Chiral centres at C-7 that are at some distance from the quinolone nucleus are said to contribute less significantly to biological activity. However, the relative orientation of the methyl groups on the C-7 piperazine of sparfloxacin is important for bacterial enzymes versus mammalian enzyme selectivity. Sparfloxacin, bearing methyl groups with a m-stereochemistry essential for its antibacterial activity, displays dramatic differential effects on mammalian topoisomerase-II with no or less interaction with the mammalian enzyme, in contrast to the trarcs-isomer which does interact with the mammalian enzyme, while however retaining its antibacterial activity (Gootz T D et al., vide infra). Unlike this prior art, the present invention once again surprisingly shows that stereochemical differences of substituents on the C-7 piperidino moiety, while dramatically affecting antibacterial activity, do not significantly influence cytotoxicity of mammalian cell lines, irrespective of whether the differences are enantiomeric or diastereomeric.<br>
Both of the third-generation fluoroquinolone market introductions of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin with improved activity against gram-positive pathogens, have an 8-methoxy substituent in the core fluoroquinolone nucleus. Even their coverage, however, of staphylococci is considered partial, as they possess weak antibacterial activity against most of the methicillin-resistant strains. Moreover, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin have failed to show therapeutically relevant potency for recent widely reported ciprofloxacin-resistant and levofloxacin-resistant strains of pneumococci. In addition, the potency of newer fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa has considerably diminished.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a need for newer orally effective fluoroquinolone antibacterials with superior potency not only against methicillin-resistant, macrolide-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, viz. multidrug-resistant strains of gram-positive staphylococci and pneumococci, but also against gram-negative strains with potency comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and against the now so called emerging infectious diseases. Accordingly, numerous studies are being continuously conducted to address the disadvantages of the fluoroquinolones having an 8-methoxy substituent or 8-alkyl substituent or other 8-substituents to make them considerably more potent against bacterial pathogens, to increase their spectrum coverage to include the insufficiently addressed pathogens like mycobacteria, anaerobes, and atypicals, to optimise their action towards bacterial molecular targets, to reduce their efflux or facilitate their cellular uptake, and to improve their oral bioavailability and toxicity profile.<br>
Some 1,4-dihydroquinolone related moieties bearing an 8-methoxy substituent are known in the art to have antimicrobial activity and are described in the following references:<br>

The feature of the known 7-substituted piperidino derived compounds is that they are said to exhibit antimicrobial properties, but either no biological data is provided or in cases where some data is provided, such piperidino derivatives have been found to be inferior in activity to those derivatives bearing 7-piperazino or 7-pyrrolidino substituents. It is only through our on-going studies in recent years as described in our pending US patent applications 09/566,875 and 09/850,669, WO 00/68229 and WO 01/85728 that there has begun to be elaborated the full potential of a fluoroquinolone core bearing an unsubstituted or substituted 4-hydroxy piperidino substituent at the 7th position of the core fluoroquinolone for use in clinical development as medicaments for life-threatening old and new emerging infectious diseases.<br>
Thus, the present inventors have extensively studied the subject by introducing various substituted piperidine groups in the 7-position of different fluoroquinolone cores and determining the microbiological/pharmacological properties of the compounds to develop the novel substituted piperidino compounds of the invention, which (a) show a potent hitherto-undescribed antibacterial potency against broad spectrum sensitive and existing/emerging resistant pathogenic strains, including P-lactam-resistant, macrolide-resistant and even fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, mycobacteria, anaerobes and atypical pathogens (b) prevent selection of resistant bacteria by apparently inhibiting both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV equally, or by potently inhibiting the enzyme it targets, (c) are not subjected to efflux or have facilitated uptake, (d) do not apparently act to merely form bacteriostatic quinolone-gyrase/topoisomerase-DNA complexes to inhibit cell growth, but also apparently extend the action to release the broken DNA ends to ensure cell death, (d) exhibit high absorption and improved pharmacokinetic properties in a living body, and (e) display a favourable safety<br><br>
profile. As a result, we have identified that the compounds of the general formula I as defined below wherein substituted piperidino groups are introduced into the 7-position of the fluoroquinolone nucleus can satisfy such a purpose.<br>
It is therefore, an aspect of the present invention to provide new non-chiral and chiral 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, of the formula I, as defined below, which show potent antibacterial activity against a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms, including both gram-positive and gram-negative strains with advantages of activity against resistant microorganisms, reduced toxicity, and improved pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a process for preparing 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula I.<br>
It is a further aspect of the present invention to prepare the intermediates that are necessary to obtain the 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula I.<br>
It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide compositions containing 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula I as an active component.<br>
It is also an aspect of the invention to use the 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula I of the invention and compositions containing them as medicaments for the treatment of infectious diseases.<br><br><br>

This invention also includes optical isomers, diastereomers, enantiomers, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or biohydrolyzable esters, amides, imides, or solvates of the fluoroquinolones of formula I and prodrugs of these compounds. A pseudopolymorph is a polymorph that differs from a true polymorph by the incorporation of solvent.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of this invention, and compositions containing these compounds, are effective antimicrobial agents which are a new generation of antibacterial agents, in particular a new generation of respiratory antibacterials, effective against multidrug-resistant pathogens with broad spectrum coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, such as sensitive and fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci, staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes, enterococci and atypical pathogens. In addition, the compounds of the invention have potent cidal action for fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. The compounds of the invention have the preferred potential to address the unmet need for orally effective drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pneumococcal infections like life-threatening pneumoniae and meningitis, to which pediatric and geriatric patients are vulnerable. They are unusually cidal for viridans streptococci, which are the causative groups of strains responsible for bacteremias, soft tissue infections, abscesses, sepsis and endocarditis. They are potential antitubercular agents against sensitive and resistant mycobacteria. The combination of physicochemical parameters contributed to the fluoroquinolone molecules by the location, hydrogen-acceptor/-donor properties, spatial bulk, hydrophobicity, stereochemical orientation of the different contributing substituents at the respective positions surprisingly provide compounds of the invention that are not effluxed by efflux pump bearing strains or have better uptake through bacterial cellular membranes. The above described physicochemical parameters also contribute to their unusually favourable<br><br>
drugability properties. They are orally effective with once-a-day potential. They have favourable penetration into tissues like the lung, liver, kidney and heart over serum thus enabling the targeting of organ-specific infections. They are relatively non-phototoxic, with favourable cytotoxicity and cardiotoxicity profiles which are usually the problem toxicities displayed by the fluoroquinolone class of compounds.<br>
Among compounds that fall within the compounds of the aforementioned general formula, optically active compounds and diastereomeric isomers, each having the substituent in a specific stereo and three-dimensional spatial orientation have both excellent antibacterial activity and high safety features.<br>
The compounds of the invention are sufficiently basic to form acid addition salts. The compounds are useful both in the free base form and the form of acid addition salts, and both forms are within the purview of the invention. The acid addition salts are in some cases a more convenient form for use. Examples of appropriate acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, benzenesulfonate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, hydrogensulfate, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, pamoate (embonate), phosphate/diphosphate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, trifluoroacetate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and the like. Preferred acid addition salts include halides, sulfonates, carboxylates, phosphates, and the like. However, other appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from other mineral acids, organic acids and amino acids. The amino acid may be selected from one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine or valine or the optically active isomers thereof or the racemic mixtures thereof or dipeptides, tripeptides and polypeptides derived from the monoaminoacid units thereof. The compounds of the invention are also sufficiently acidic to form alkaline/base addition salts. Preferred alkali/base addition salts include the alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium), inorganic salts, such as ammonium, substituted ammonium, choline and organic base salts from basic amines such as diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, guanidine or heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, hydroxyethylpyrrolidine,     hydroxyethylpiperidine,     morpholine,     piperazine,     N-methyl<br>
piperazine and the like or basic amino acids such as optically pure and racemic isomers of arginine, lysine, histidine, tryptophan and the like.<br>
In practice, the use of the salt form inherently amounts to the use of the base form of the active. Acids used to prepare acid addition salts include preferably those, which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These salts have anions that are relatively innocuous to the animal organism, such as a mammal, in pharmaceutical doses of the salts so that the beneficial property inherent in the free base are not vitiated by any side effects ascribable to the acid's anions.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of the free base of formula I with about one chemical equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as an inorganic acid or organic acid. Conventional concentration and recrystallization techniques are employed in isolating the salts.<br>
For example, the free base can be dissolved in an aqueous alcohol solution containing the appropriate acid and the salt is isolated by evaporation of the solution. Alternatively, they may be prepared by reacting the free base with an acid in an organic solvent so that the salt separates directly. Where separation of the salt is difficult, it can be precipitated with a second organic solvent, or can be obtained by concentration of the solution.<br>
Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are within the scope of the present invention. All acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form, even if the particular salt per se is desired only as an intermediate product. For example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification or identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures, these salts are clearly contemplated to be a part of this invention.<br>
The amino moiety of piperidine is a potential point of formation for the subject compounds of a pharmaceutically acceptable anionic salt; such salts are included in the subject invention compounds. Preferred salts are acid addition salts with, for example, HC1, CH3COOH,<br><br>
CH3SO3H, HCOOH, CF3COOH, gluconic acid, C1-20 straight chain or branched alkanoic acids or one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as hereinbefore defined or dipeptide, tripeptide or polypeptide derivatives 0f the monoaminoacid units thereof.<br>
"Host" is a substrate capable of sustaining a microbe, preferably it is a living organism, and most preferably an animal, more preferably a mammal, and more preferably still a human.<br>
"Biohydrolyzable amides" are aminoacyl, acylamino, or other amides of the compounds of the invention, where the amide does not essentially interfere, preferably does not interfere, with the activity of the compound, or where the amide is readily converted in vivo by a host to yield an active compound.<br>
"Biohydrolyzable imides" are imides of the compounds of the invention, where the imide does not essentially interfere, preferably does not interfere, with the activity of the compound, or where the imide is readily converted in vivo by a host to yield an active compound. Preferred imides are hydroxyimides.<br>
"Biohydrolyzable esters" are esters of the compounds of the invention, where the ester does not essentially interfere, preferably does not interfere, with the antimicrobial activity of the compound, or where the ester is readily converted in a host to yield an active compound. Many such esters are known in the art. Such esters include lower alkyl esters, lower acyloxy-alkyl esters (such as acetoxymethyl, acetoxyethyl, aminocarbonyloxymethyl, pivaloyloxylmethyl and pivaloyloxyiethyl esters); lactonyl esters (such as phthalidyl and thiophthalidyl esters) lower alkoxya.cyloxyalkyl esters (such as methoxycarbonyloxymethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and isopropoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters), alkoxyalkyl esters, choline esters and alkylacylaminoalkyl esters (such as acetamidomethyl esters) and alkyl amino acid esters.<br>
The illustration of specific protected forms and other derivatives of the formula 1 compounds are not intended to be limiting. The application of other useful protecting groups, salt forms, etc. is within the ability of the skilled artisan.<br><br>
"Optical isomer", "stereoisomer", "diastereomer" "polymorph" "pseudopolymorph", "hydrates" and "solvates" as referred to herein have the standard art recognized meanings. Solvates are generally formed during the process of crystallization when molar or submolar amounts of the solvents get incorporated into the crystal structure of the compound.<br>
The compounds of the invention may contain chiral center(s), thus any such compound includes and contemplates each optical isomer, diastereomer or enantiomer thereof, in purified or substantially purified form, and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures. The compounds of the invention may have one or more chiral centers. As a result, one may selectively prepare one optical isomer, including diastereomer and enantiomer, over another, for example by use of chiral starting materials, catalysts or solvents, one may prepare both stereoisomers or both optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers at once (a racemic mixture). Since the compounds of the invention may exist as racemic mixtures, mixtures of optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, or stereoisomers, they may be separated using known methods, such as chiral resolution, chiral chromatography and the like. In addition, it is recognized that one optical isomer, including diastereomer and enantiomer, or stereoisomer may have favorable properties over the other. Thus when disclosing and claiming the invention, when one racemic mixture is disclosed, it is clearly contemplated that both optical isomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, or stereoisomers substantially free of the other are disclosed and claimed as well.<br>
As used herein, a quinolone derivative includes prodrugs of a quinolone.<br>
The preferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of Formula I which are composed of on one hand the following core fluoroquinolone moieties displayed below minus the respective 7-amino substituent:<br><br><br><br><br>
It is preferred that one of the following amines can be combined with the core fluoroquinolone moieties as shown above. The prefix "c" represents cyclo:<br><br><br><br>
including their optical isomers and diastereomers.<br>
The combinations of the above mentioned cores and the above mentioned amines provide the fluoroquinolone compounds of the invention.<br>
The following exemplary compounds are made using the procedures described herein and variations thereof which are within the purview of the skilled artisan's practice. The examples below do not limit the invention, but rather serve to illustrate some of embodiments of the invention.<br>
In the following tables (Tables 1 - 16), there are provided some examples of the compounds of the invention. The lower case "c" represents "cyclo".<br>

The above mentioned novel intermediates are used to prepare the novel amines of the invention. The intermediates can be classified as (a) the unprotected dialkyl or trialkyl 4-piperidones, (b) the dialkyl or trialkyl 1-N protected 4-piperidones and (c) the dialkyl 1-N protected, 4-protected amino piperidines.<br>
The unprotected dialkyl or trialkyl 4-piperidone intermediates can be used to prepare the corresponding amines by using the known art of transforming a carbonyl functionality to an amine functionality by using reagents such as ammonium acetate, methyl amine hydrocholide, ethyl amine hydrochloride, cyclopropyl amine etc to form an imino functionality which upon subsequent reduction can produce desired amine after reduction. The reducing agents can be selected from sodium cyano borohydride or palladium on carbon in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate etc.<br>
The dialkyl or trialkyl 1-N protected 4-piperidones are used to prepare the corresponding deprotected amines by using the known art of deprotection such as hydrogenolysis to deprotect a benzyloxycarbonyl moiety or a benzyl moiety by stirring the intermediate in the presence of catalysts and a hydrogen source. The catalyst can be selected from palladium on carbon, palladium hydroxide on carbon and hydrogen source can be selected from hydrogen gas or ammonium formate, cyclohexene, in solvents such as methanol ethanol, ethyl acetate etc.<br>
The dialkyl 1-N protected, 4-protected amino piperidines can be used to prepare the corresponding deprotected amines by using the known art of deprotection as described in the previous paragraph to remove a benzyloxycarbonyl or a benzyl moiety and the known art of removing a butyloxycarbonyl group by stirring the intermediate, in the presence of inorganic acids such as concentrated hydrochloric acid or organic acids such as trifluoro acetic acid in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane etc.<br><br>
The preparations 1 - 38 include examples of the specific preparative methods used of how to 'use the described amine intermediates for the preparation of the corresponding novel amines of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of the free base of the formula I with about one chemical equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as an inorganic acid or organic acid. Conventional concentration and recrystallization techniques are employed in isolating the salts. For example, the free base can be dissolved in an aqueous alcohol solution containing the appropriate acid and the salt is isolated by evaporation of the solution. Alternatively, they may be prepared by reacting the free base with an acid in an organic solvent so that the salt separates directly. Where separation of the salt is difficult, it can be precipitated with a second organic solvent, or can be obtained by concentration of the solution. Examples of appropriate acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, benzenesulfonate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, hydrogensulfate, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, pamoate (embonate), phosphate/diphosphate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, trifluoroacetate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and the like. Preferred acid addition salts include halides, sulfonates, carboxylates, phosphates, and the like. However, other appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from other mineral acids, organic acids and amino acids. The amino acid may be selected from one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine or valine or the optically active isomers thereof or the racemic mixtures thereof or dipeptides, tripeptides and polypeptides derived from the monoaminoacid units thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable alkali/base addition salts of compounds of formula I may be prepared by conventional methods from the corresponding acids e.g. by reaction with about one equimolar amount of an alkali/base. Preferred alkali/base addition salts include the alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium), inorganic salts, such as ammonium, substituted ammonium, choline and organic  base  salts  from  basic  amines  such   as  diethanolamine,  N-methyl  glucamine,<br><br>
ethylenediamine, guanidine or heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, 'hydroxyethylpyrrolidine, hydroxyethylpiperidine, morpholine, piperazine, N-methyl piperazine and the like or basic amino acids such as optically pure and racemic isomers of arginine, lysine, histidine, tryptophan and the like.<br>
The hydrates, pseudopolymorphs, polymorphs and solvates of all the compounds of the invention are also included and are prepared by conventional methods.<br>
The present invention also encompasses the process of making the intermediate amines, as illustrated in the detailed preparations that are used in the condensation with the fluoroquinolone nucleus. For instance, the 3-substituted-4-aminopiperidine intermediates can exist as a mixture of cis and trans isomers and the mixture was prepared by the procedure described in Preparation 1. The mixture of cis and trans isomers of 4-amino-3-methylpiperidine was prepared by a sequence as described in Preparation 34. Each cis and trans isomer is a racemic mixture and can be resolved into optically active enantiomeric forms by the usual methods of optical resolution of amines known to those skilled in the art. Other 3-substituted-4-aminopiperidines were synthesised using a similar method.<br>
The 4-amino-3,5-dimethylpiperidine intermediate was obtained in the following manner. 4-Amino-l-carbethoxy-3,5-dimethylpiperidine (a mixture of isomers) was prepared according to the procedure described in Preparation 25 and separated by silica gel column chromatography into the two major mixtures of isomers, one mixture designated as upper mixture A and the other designated as lower mixture B of isomers. Conformations of these mixtures of isomers were not assigned. Using any one of the mixtures of isomers of 4-amino-3,5-dimethylpiperidine, some compounds of the invention can be prepared by condensing the respective mixture of isomers of 4-amino-3,5-dimethyl-piperidine with [l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-l,4-dihydro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylate-03,04]difluoroboron chelate, as exemplified in the section on examples described later in this specification.<br>
The present invention also encompasses an antiinfective composition for the treatment of humans and animals in need of prophylaxix and/or therapy for systemic or topical infections especially resistant gram-positive organism infections, gram-negative organism infections, mycobacterial infections and nosocomial pathogen infections, which composition comprises<br>
combination of all these properties coupled with overall good safety and tolerability 'observed in a new molecule renders them worthy of therapeutic use in humans and animals. By virtue of such features, they have considerable advantages over existing fluoroquinolone antibacterials, in particular in the treatment of respiratory diseases and infections of skin and soft tissue.<br>
The above list of pathogens is merely by way of example and is in no way to be interpreted as limiting. Streptococci are implicated as one of the most common pathogens, in both the pediatric and adult population in diverse infections/diseases. Examples which may be mentioned of diseases, which can thus be prevented, alleviated and/or cured by the formulations according to the invention include but are not limited to are meningitis, otitis externa, otitis media; pharyngitis; pneumonia; life-threatening bacteremia, peritonitis; pyelonephritis; cystitis; endocarditis; systemic infections; bronchitis; arthritis; local infections; and septic diseases. Several molecules of the present inventions also exhibit impressive gains in potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and therefore of potential value in the treatment of latent and recalcitrant mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis.<br>
These findings have an important implication from the point of view of the systemic use of the compounds of the invention in view of their superior potency, superior bactericidal activity, expanded biospectrum, better bioavailability and improved tolerability which are now enabled to be administered systemically in therapeutically effective doses. Utilizing the compounds of the invention or the substantially optically pure or optically pure isomers, the derivatives and salts thereof, whether in systemic or topical dosage form, results in clearer dose-related definitions of efficacy, diminished toxic effects and accordingly an improved therapeutic index.<br>
The present invention encompasses certain compounds, dosage forms, and methods of administering the compounds to a human or other animal subject. Specific compounds and compositions to be used in the invention must, accordingly, be pharmaceutically acceptable. As used herein, such a "pharmaceutically acceptable" component is one that is suitable for use with humans and / or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared according to conventional procedures used by 'persons skilled in the art to make stable and effective compositions. In the solid, liquid, parenteral and topical dosage forms, an effective amount of the active compound or the active ingredient is any amount, which produces the desired results.<br>
For the purpose of this invention the pharmaceutical compositions may contain the active compounds of the invention, their derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof, in a form to be administered alone, but generally in a form to be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Suitable carriers which can be used are, for example, diluents or excipients such as fillers, extenders, binders, emollients, wetting agents, disintegrants, surface active agents and lubricants which are usually employed to prepare such drugs depending on the type of dosage form.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing the patient with an effective dosage of the compound of the invention their derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof. For example, oral, rectal, parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous), transdermal, topical and like forms of administration may be employed. Dosage forms include (solutions, suspensions, etc) tablets, pills, powders, troches, dispersions, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, capsules, injectable preparations, patches, ointments, creams, lotions, shampoos and the like.<br>
The prophylactic or therapeutic dose of the compounds of the invention, their derivatives, salts or hydrates thereof, in the acute or chronic management of disease will vary with the severity of condition to be treated, and the route of administration. In addition, the dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose range, for the compounds of the invention, the derivatives, salts or hydrates thereof, for the conditions described herein, is from about 200 mg to about 1500 mg, in single or divided doses. Preferably, a daily dose range should be between about 400 mg to 1200 mg, in single or divided dosage, while most preferably a daily dose range should be between about 500 mg to about 1000 mg in divided dosage. While intramuscular administration may be a single dose or up to 3 divided doses, intravenous administration can includ a continuous drip. It may be necessary to use dosages<br>
outside these ranges in some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, it is 'noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient's response. The term "an amount sufficient to eradicate such infections but insufficient to cause undue side effects" is encompassed by the above - described dosage amount and dose frequency schedule.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or aerosol sprays, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.<br>
The compositions of the present invention include compositions such as suspensions, solutions, elixirs, aerosols, and solid dosage forms. Carriers as described in general above are commonly used in the case of oral solid preparations (such as powders, capsules and tablets), with the oral solid preparations being preferred over the oral liquid preparations. The most preferred oral solid preparation is tablets.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Examples of suitable carriers include excipients such as lactose, white sugar, sodium chloride, glucose solution, urea, starch, calcium carbonate, kaolin, crystalline cellulose and silicic acid, binders such as water, ethanol, propanol, simple syrup, glucose, starch solution, gelatin solution, carboxymethyl cellulose, shellac, methyl cellulose, potassium phosphate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, disintegrants such as dried starch, sodium alginate, agar powder, laminaria powder, sodium hydrogen carbonate, calcium carbonate, Tween (fatty acid ester of polyoxyethylenesorbitan), sodium lauryl sulfate, stearic acid monoglyceride, starch, and lactose, disintegration inhibitors such as white sugar, stearic acid glyceryl ester, cacao butter and hydrogenated oils, absorption promoters such as quaternary ammonium bases and<br><br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, humectants such as glycerol and starch, absorbents such as starch, 'lactose, kaolin, bentonite and colloidal silicic acid, and lubricants such as purified talc, stearic acid salts, boric acid powder, polyethylene glycol and solid polyethylene glycol.<br>
The tablet, if desired, can be coated, and made into sugar-coated tablets, gelatin-coated tablets, enteric-coated tablets, film-coated tablets, or tablets comprising two or more layers.<br>
If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques.<br>
In molding the pharmaceutical composition into pills, a wide variety of conventional carriers known in the art can be used. Examples of suitable carriers are excipients such as glucose, lactose, starch, cacao butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin and talc, binders such as gum arabic powder, tragacanth powder, gelatin, and ethanol, and disintegrants such as laminaria and agar.<br>
In molding the pharmaceutical composition into a suppository form, a wide variety of carriers known in the art can be used. Examples of suitable carriers include polyethylene glycol, cacao butter, higher alcohols, gelatin, and semi-synthetic glycerides.<br>
A second preferred method is parenterally for intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous administration.<br>
A third preferred route of administration is topically, for which creams, ointments, shampoos, lotions, dusting powders and the like are well suited. Generally, an effective amount of the compound according to this invention in a topical form is from about 0.1% w/w to about 10 % w/w of the total composition. Preferably, the effective amount of the compound of the invention is 1% w/w of the total composition.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123 and 4,008,719; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Desirably, each tablet contains from about 200 mg to about 1500 mg of the active ingredient. 'Most preferably, the tablet, cachet or capsule contains either one of three dosages, about 200 mg, about 400 mg, or about 600 mg of the active ingredient.<br>
When the pharmaceutical composition is formulated into an injectable preparation, in formulating the pharmaceutical composition into the form of a solution or suspension, all diluents customarily used in the art can be used. Examples of suitable diluents are water, ethyl alcohol, polypropylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene sorbitol, and sorbitan esters. Sodium chloride, glucose or glycerol may be incorporated into a therapeutic agent.<br>
The antimicrobial pharmaceutical composition may further contain ordinary dissolving aids, buffers, pain-alleviating agents, and preservatives, and optionally coloring agents, perfumes, flavors, sweeteners, and other drugs.<br>
For topical application, there are employed as non-sprayable forms, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water. Suitable formulations include but are not limited to solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, aerosols, etc., which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g. preservatives, antioxidants, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers or salts for influencing osmotic pressure, etc. For topical application, also suitable are sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier material.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is the preparation of storage stable compositions of the compounds of the invention of formula I. Such stable compositions can be advantageously made through the use of selective stabilizers. Different stabilizers are known to those skilled in the art of making pharmaceutical compositions. Of special utility for making storage stable compositions of the compound of the invention of formula I, stabilizers such as disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tromethamine, cyclodextrins such as gamma-cyclodextrin, hydroxy-propyl-gamma-cyclodextrin have been found to be useful.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions contain an effective amount of the active compounds of the invention, its derivatives, salts or hydrates<br><br>
thereof described in this specification as hereinbefore described in admixture with a 'pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipients, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples describing in detail the preparation of the composition of the present invention as well as their utility.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
Microbiological and pharmacological studies can be used to determine the relative potency, and the profile of specificity of the compounds of the invention as antibacterial agent with a spectrum of activity as described in the specification above.<br>
In the following examples, the compounds of the invention are numbered as per the list of the specific compounds of the invention described earlier in the text.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 1 In-vitro Antimicrobial Tests<br>
The comparative antimicrobial activity of representative compounds of the invention and reference compounds against various sensitive and resistant microorganisms is given in Tables 17 to 20. The test method was in accordance with the standard NCCLS protocol (Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that grow Aerobicially, Approved Standards, M7-A5, Fifth Edition, January 2000).<br>
The antibacterial activities (minimum inhibitory concentration: MIC, mcg/ml) were determined by using the two-fold serial agar dilution method recommended by NCCLS. The media used for preculture and main culture were Tryptic Soya broth (Difco) and Mueller Hinton medium (Difco), respectively. The Mueller Hinton agar was supplemented with 5% sheep blood for streptococci. Overnight cultures were diluted with buffered saline (pH 7.2) to the final cell density of 5 x 106-107 CFU/ml, and each bacterial suspension was applied with a replicator (Denley's multipoint inoculator, UK) onto a series of Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing antibacterial agents at various concentrations. Final inoculum was approximately 104 CFU/spot. The plates were incubated for 18 hrs at 37° C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that inhibits the development of visible microbial growth on agar. The results obtained are shown in tables 17 to 20.<br><br>

The data shows that the reference compounds, which although are active against sensitive staphylococci, are rendered quite unattractive due to serious loss in their potency against clinical isolate MRSA 5076 expressing triple fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms. The fold difference between the MIC values for each compound in the last two columns indicates the effect of the efflux pump mechanism on the susceptibility of the strains to the respective compounds. The compounds of the invention are 4-fold to 500-fold more potent than the reference compounds against the resistant strain as seen in column 3.<br>
Resistance to Resistance Development<br>
Compound No. 18 was evaluated in comparison with Moxifloxacin and Trovafloxacin in terms of resistance to resistance development on sequential transfer / passages through respective drug-containing media. Initially all the three drugs had comparable activity against MRSA 5027 (0.4 u.g/ml). However, after 10 passages in drug containing medium, MIC for Moxifloxacin and Trovafloxacin was 6.25 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml respectively, while compound No. 18 showed no elevation and remained 0.4 µg/ml. The data indicates that compound No. 18 has a remarkable property of resisting the development and selection of MRSA strains resistant to it and is significantly less likely to select resistant mutants in a clinical scenario, thus obviating the risk of treatment failure in patients.<br><br><br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 2 In-vivo Antimicrobial Tests<br>
Protocol for Systemic Infection Model<br>
The in vivo efficacy was studied through mouse septicemia model of infection in Swiss male and female mice (4 weeks old, 20 + 2g weight) using 6 animals in each group. Infective organisms were inoculated intraperitonially. Compound were administered by oral route 1 hour and 5 hours post-infection. By Probit analysis protective doses were calculated from the survival rate on day 7 in terms of ED50 (50% survival dose) values. Appropriate comparators were included in the study.<br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 3 Acute Toxicity<br>
Each test compound or reference compound was administered orally to groups of 10 swiss mice (body weight: 22-26 gms) each, whereby its acute toxicity was investigated. The compounds were administered in solution form. As a result it was found that the median lethal dose (LD50) values of compounds 18, 19 and 20 were 650 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 650 mg/kg respectively.   The LD50 of reference compound  moxifloxacin was 600 mg/kg.  On<br><br>
the basis of data of ED50 values (provided in table 22) the therapeutic index (LD50/ED50) for |he test compounds is 3.0 to 7.5 times higher than that for moxifloxacin.<br>
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 4 Cytotoxicity<br>
Protocol for cytotoxicity test<br>
Compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential against two celllines viz. J 744 (mouse macrophage) and V79 (Chinese Hamster Lung). Cells were grown for 3 - 4 days in a culture flask using D-MEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Freshly grown cells were distributed in microtiter plates at a cell density of 105-106 cells / well and allowed to adhere and form monolayer by incubating the microtiter plate at 37°C for 24 hrs. Medium from each well was aspirated and replaced with fresh D-MEM (supplemented with 2.5% FBS) containing various concentrations of compounds. Following 3 hrs. of drug exposure, cells were washed with D-MEM and incubated further for 96 hrs. Cytotoxic effects of drugs were monitored through daily microscopic observation and by ascertaining the metabolic status through redox indicator Alamar blue. Healthy actively metabolising cells bring about colour change of Alamar blue from blue to pink within an overnight incubation. Cytotoxic drugs inhibit this reaction resulting into blue coloured wells. Minimum drug concentration inhibiting Alamar blue color change i.e. resulting into blue coloured wells for a given drug is considered cytotoxic concentration.<br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 5 Phototoxicity<br>
Six groups of healthy Swiss Albino mice consisting of 6 males per group were orally administered with a single dose of a compound of the invention or a reference compound at dose levels of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg. The stock solutions for different doses were prepared freshly on the day of experimentation. Appropriate concentration of each dose was chosen to give a constant dosage volume of 0.3-0.4 mV20g body weight of mouse. The treated mice were exposed to UVA light source immediately after dosing for 4 hours and for 4 consecutive days. The mean light intensity in the UVA chamber was adjusted to 0.9-1.2 mW/cm2. The total irradiation dose was approximately 18 Joules/cm2 /day. A phototoxic dose is one which causes ear erythema and oeadema. The phototoxic doses of compounds 18, 19 and 20 of the present invention were greater than 500 mg/kg, whereas the phototoxic dose for reference compound sparfloxacin was 25 mg/kg, thus indicating that the compounds of the present invention induced no phototoxicity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
