				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing trovafloxacin and more particularly, a process for preparing antibacterial quinolone and naphthyridone carboxylic acids having an external, primary amino group. The process is<br>
performed without the use, or subsequent removal, of blocking groups on the external, primary amino group.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Quinolone and naphthyridone carboxylic acids, zwitterionic salts thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful as antibacterial agents, and have been prepared according to methods described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,738,968 to Matsumoto et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,382,937 to Matsumoto et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,382,892 to Hayakawa et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,571,396 to Hutt et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,416,884 to Ishikawa et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,775,668 to Jefson et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,164,402 to Brighty and U.K. Patent Publication No. 2,191,776 to Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. Such quinolone and naphthyridone carboxylic acids, and zwitterionic salts thereof, have been obtained (see, e.g., U.S..Patent No. 5,164,402 to Brighty) by coupling a compound of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, especially ethyl or methyl, or hydrogen; A is CH, CF, CCI, COCH3, CCH3, CCN or N; Y, when taken independently, is ethyl, t-butyl, vinyl, cyclopropyl, 2-fluoroethyl, p-fluorophenyl, or o,p-difluorophenyl; or A is a carbon atom and is taken together with Y and the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which A and Y are attached to form a five- or six-membered ring which may contain oxygen or a double bond, and which may have methyl or methylene attached to the ring; and W is H, F, Cl, Br, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, amino or NHCH3; with a cyclic compound having an amino group, and having the formula II<br>
HR'fCH^NHX	II<br>
wherein a is 0 or 1; R1 is a cyclic secondary amino group; and X is a protecting group, such as tertiary-butoxycarbonylamino.<br>
The coupling of a compound of formula I with a compound of formula II results in the displacement of the chloro group from, and the attachment of the secondary amino group to, the 7-carbon atom of the compound of formula I.<br>
Examples of compounds of formula II are 3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and 3-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (U.S. Patent No. 5,164,402 to Brighty), and pyrrolidines (U.S. Patent No. 4,382,937 and U.S. Patent No. 4,738,968 to Matsumoto et al.), each bearing a protected amino group.<br>
It is necessary that a compound of formula II have a protecting group (in the form of "X") on its primary amino group to prevent the otherwise unprotected primary amino group from competing with the secondary amino group for bond formation with the 7-carbon atom of the compound of formula I. However, the need for such a protecting group adds at least two extra steps to the synthesis of quinolone and naphthyridone carboxylic acids: (1) the addition of the protecting group onto the primary amino group of a compound of formula II prior to reaction with a compound of formula I, and (2) the removal of the protecting group subsequent to reaction with a compound of formula I. These additional steps naturally add to the cost of the synthesis, lengthen the time in which the synthesis can be completed, and limit the time<br>
that workers can spend performing other experiments.  Accordingly, a process for obtaining<br>
quinolone and naphthyridone carboxylic acids that omits the use of protecting groups would be highly desirable and advantageous.<br>
Citation or identification of any reference in Section 2 of this application shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is available as prior art to the present application.<br>

4.3 COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA V<br>
The compounds of formula V are represented by the formula:<br>
HR1(CH2)aNH2 (ZH)b	V<br>
wherein R1 is a cyclic secondary amino group, a is 0 or 1, ZH is an acid, and b ranges from 1 to the number of basic nitrogen atoms in the compound of formula V.<br>
Useful cyclic secondary amino groups include, but are not limited to, aziridinyl, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, 3-hydroxylpyrrolidinyl, 3-dimethylaminopyrrolidinyl, 3-acetylaminopyrrolidinyl, 3-methylacetylaminopyrrolidinyl, 3-aminopyrrolidinyl, 3-methylaminopyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, 4-methylaminopiperidinyl, piperazinyl, N-methylpiperazinyl, N-ethylpiperazinyl, N-propylpiperazinyl, N-isopropylpiperazinyl, N-acetylpiperazinyl, 3-methylpiperazinyl, N-methyl-2-methylpiperazinyl, N-methyl-3-methylpiperazinyl, N-allylpiperazinyl, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-methylpiperazinyl, 3,5-dimethylpiperazinyl, 2,5-dimethylpiperazinyl, N-(hydroxyethyl)piperazinyl, morpholinyl, hexamethyleneiminyl, heptamethyleneiminyl, 3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl and 3-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptyl groups, the cyclic secondary amino groups being optionally substituted with one or more nitro, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo or alkylsulfonyl groups. Examples of optionally substituted 3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl and 3-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptyl groups are found in U.S. Patent No. 5,164,402 to Brighty.<br>
The compounds of formula V are salts of HR1(CH2)aNH2 and ZH. Any carboxylic acid is suitable as ZH; preferably, ZH is a mineral acid such as HCI, HBr, nitric acid or sulfuric acid; a C1-C6 alkylsulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or ethanesulfoninc acid; or a C6-C10 arylsulfonic acid such as benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid or naphthalenesulfonic acid.<br>
In general, the compounds of formula V are obtained by admixing, in any suitable organic solvent, ZH and HR1(CH2)aNH2, wherein from one equivalent of ZH, or a slight excess thereof, is used per equivalent of HR1(CH2)aNH2, up to one equivalent of ZH, or a slight excess thereof, per equivalent of basic nitrogen atom in HR1(CH2)aNH2. The solvent may be removed via conventional means to provide the compound of formula V or the solution may be used for further reaction according to the invention. It will be understood that because R1 is a cyclic secondary amino group, HR1(CH2)3NH2 has at least two basic nitrogen atoms, i.e., -NH2 and the secondary amino group(s) of R1; accordingly, "b," the preferred number of ZH units in the compound of formula V, is at least two. Alternatively, where the precursor of HR1(CH2)aNH2 is a compound that has an acid-labile protecting group on -NH2 and on the secondary amino group (see U.S. Patent No., 5,164,402 to Brighty), the compound of formula IV may be formed in situ by removal of the protecting groups with ZH.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, HR'(CH2)aNH2 is 3-aminopyrrolidine or 3-aminethylpyrrolidine. In another embodiment of the invention, R' is a bicyclic group that comprises a 3-membered ring and a 4-membered ring. Examples of such bicyclic groups are found in U.S. Patent No. 5,164,402 to Brighty.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, b is the numner of basic nitrogens in the compound of formula V.<br>
Preferably, HR1(CH2)aNH2 is (1α, 5α, 6α)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0.]hexane. Most preferably, the compound of formula V is the ditosylate salt of (1α, 5α, 6α)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0.]hexane.<br>
4.4 COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA III<br>
The compounds of formula III have the structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and include zwitterionic salts thereof.<br>
Compounds of formula III, and zwitterionic salts thereof, are prepared by a process comprising the step of contacting, in the presence of a tertiary amine base:<br>
(a)	a compound of formula IV:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein A is CH, CF, CCI, COCH3, CCH3, CCN or N;<br>
Y, when taken independently, is ethyl, t-butyl, vinyl, cyclopropyl, 2-fluoroethyl, p-fluorophenyl, or o,p-difluorophenyl;<br>
or A is carbon atom and is taken together with Y and with the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which A and Y are attached to form a five- or six-membered ring which may contain oxygen or a double bond, and which may have methyl or methylene attached to the ring;<br>
W is H, F, Cl, Br, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, amino or NHCH3; and<br>
X is halogen, with<br>
(b) a an interger ranging from 1 to compound of formula V:<br>
HR1(CH2)aNH2.(ZH)b wherein R1 is a cyclic secondary amino group having a nucleophilic nitrogen atom;<br>
ZH is an acid;<br>
a is 0 or 1; and<br>
b ranges from one to the number of basic nitrogen atoms in the compound of formula V.<br>
The coupling reaction proceeds in good yield, e.g., 75% yield or greater, and avoids the use, i.e., addition and removal, of protecting groups.<br>
Without being bound by any particular theory, Applicant believes that the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of the secondary amino group of the compound of formula V displaces the halogen group (X) from the 7-carbon atom of the compound of formula IV, and forms a bond therewith. It will be understood that since the coupling reaction is performed in the presence of a tertiary amine base, protonated forms of the compound of formula IV will exist in some equilibrium concentration with the protonated form of the tertiary amine base. It is believed that protonation of the -NH2 group of the compound of formula V renders the -NH2 group non-nucleophilic, so that the resulting -NH3+ group does not compete effectively with the cyclic secondary amino group of the compound of formula V for the 7-carbon atom of the compound of formula IV. Following addition of the cyclic secondary amino group and departure of X", the resulting compound of formula III can spontaneously form a stable internal salt in the form of a zwitterion and, depending upon the presence or type of coupling reaction solvent, precipitate from solution.<br>
In general, compounds of formula III or zwitterionic salts thereof are obtained by combining, in no preferred order, a compound of formula IV, a compound of formula V, and a tertiary amine base.<br>
Preferably, the tertiary amine base has the formula (R2)(R2)(R2)N, wherein each R2 is independently a C1-C6 alkyl or (C5-C10)aryl group; or the tertiary amine base is an aromatic compound having an endocyclic nitrogen atom. Suitable tertiary amine bases include, but are not limited to, triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dimethylisopropylamine, methyldibutylamine, triphenylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 2,6-lutidine, 2,4,6-collidine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,8-naphthalenediamine, and the like.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula IV to the compound of formula V is generally about 1:1, although a slight excess of either the compound of formula IV or the compound of formula V may be used. The ratio of the tertiary amine base to the compound of formula IV or to compound of formula V is generally from about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably from about 2:1 to about 5:1, and most preferably about 3:1.<br>
The use of the tertiary amine base substantially avoids the formation of an unwanted byproduct of the coupling reaction, i.e., the product formed from the reaction of both the secondary and primary amino groups of a compound of formula V with the halogen groups (X) at the 7-carbon atom of at least one and, preferably, at least two equivalents of a compound of formula IV. For example, the use of triethylamine in the coupling reaction between 7-chloro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid and the ditosylate salt of (1a, 5a, 6a)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane greatly reduces the formation of the compound of the formula VII:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In addition, when triethylamine is used in the coupling reaction between 7-chloro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic   acid   and   the ditosylate   salt   of   (1a,   5a,   6a)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane,   the   formation   of hypothetical compound VIM cannot be detected: 0<br>
Suitable coupling reaction solvents include (C1-C6) alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethylether; polar aprotic solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and N-<br><br>
methylpyrrolidinone; and mixtures thereof. The compounds of formula IV and formula V should be at least partially soluble in the coupling reaction solvent chosen; accordingly, it is well within the purview of one of skill in the art to select an appropriate solvent or mixture of solvents. Preferably, the coupling reaction solvent is methanol or ethanol. More preferably, the coupling reaction solvent is methanol.<br>
The coupling reaction is conveniently performed at a temperature of about 60°C or above, and for a period of time ranging from about 1 hour to about 48 hours, preferably for a period of time ranging from about 2 hours to about 24 hours. More preferably, the coupling reaction is performed at the reflux temperature of the particular solvent used, and for a period of time ranging from about 6 hours to about 20 hours.<br>
Generally, the product of the coupling reaction, i.e., a compound of formula III or a zwitterionic salt thereof, is insoluble in the coupling reaction solvent, and precipitates upon formation. Accordingly, the compound of formula III or zwitterionic salt thereof can be isolated by merely filtering it from the coupling reaction solvent, and optionally washing it with the same type of coupling reaction solvent. In the case where the compound of formula III or zwitterionic salt thereof is soluble in the coupling reaction solvent, the compound of formula III or zwitterionic salt thereof can be isolated by concentrating the coupling reaction mixture, optionally in vacuo, and purifying the resulting residue using column, e.g., silica gel, chromatography; crystallization from common laboratory solvents; or another purification method known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Preferably, the compound of formula III is trovafloxacin, which can exist in the form of its zwitterionic salt. Trovafloxacin is conveniently prepared by contacting, in the presence of a tertiary amine base described above, 7-chloro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid with a compound of formula VI. Preferably, the compound of formula VI is the ditosylate salt of (1a, 5a, 6a)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1 .Ojhexane, and the tertiary amine base is triethylamine.<br>
It is believed that the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of the secondary amino group of the compound of formula VI, i.e., the endocyclic nitrogen atom of (1a, 5a, 6a)-6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane, displaces the chloro group from the 7-carbon atom of 7-chloro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, and forms a bond therewith to provide trovafloxacin or a zwitterionic salt thereof.<br>
Advantageously, the reaction of 7-chloro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-OXO-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid with the compound of formula VI proceeds in the presence of a coupling reaction solvent described above. Preferably, the coupling reaction solvent is methanol.<br>
4.6 METHODS FOR USING COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA III<br>
The compounds of formula III, zwitterionic salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of broad spectrum, particularly the treatment of gram-positive bacterial strains. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including, but not limited to, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, methanesulfonic, tartaric, sulfuric, citric, acetic and maleic acid salts, are obtained by mixing one equivalent of the above acid with a compound of formula III, or with a zwitterionic salt thereof, in the presence of an inert solvent. The solvent can be concentrated to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula III, or of a zwitterionic salt thereof, in isolated form.<br>
The compounds of formula III, zwitterionic salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they can be administered orally or in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. In the case of animals, they are advantageously contained in an animal feed or drinking water in a concentration of 5-5000 ppm, preferably 25-500 ppm. They can be injected parenterally, for example, intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other solutes, for example, enough salt or glucose to make the solution isotonic. In the case of animals, the compounds can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously at dosage levels of about 0.1-50 mg/kg/day, advantageously 0.2-10 mg/kg/day given in a single daily dose or up to 3 divided doses.<br>
The compounds of formula III, zwitterionic salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered to humans for the treatment of bacterial diseases by either the oral or parenteral routes, and may be administered orally at dosage levels of about 0.1 to 500 mg/kg/day, advantageously 0.5-50 mg/kg/day given in a single dose or up to 3 divided doses. For intramuscular or intravenous administration, dosage levels are about 0.1-200 mg/kg/day, advantageously 0.5-50 mg/kg/day. While intramuscular administration may be a single dose or up to 3 divided doses, intravenous administration can include a continuous drip. Variations will necessarily occur depending on the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen as will be known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The antibacterial activity of the compounds of formula III, zwitterionic salts thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is shown by testing according to the Steer's<br>
replicator technique which is a standard in vitro bacterial testing method described by E. Steers et al., Antibiotics and Chemotherapy, 9, 307 (1959).<br>
