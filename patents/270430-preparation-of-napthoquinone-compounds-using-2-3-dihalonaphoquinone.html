'PREPARATION OF NAPTHOQUINONE COMPOUNDS'<br>
ALKEM LABORATORIES LIMITED, A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, HAVING ITS CORPORATE OFFICE AT ALKEM HOUSE, DEVASHISH, ADJACENT TO MATULYA CENTRE, S B.MARG, LOWER PAREL, MUMBAI - 400013, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to preparation of napthoquinone compounds by using a 2,3-dihalonapthoquinone intermediate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A wide range of naphthoquinones is known in the art. Such compounds have been variously described as having antimalarial, anticoccidial and antitheilerial activity. Some compounds have also been described as possessing activity against external parasites. Thus, Fieser et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1948, 70, 3156-3165 (and references cited therein) describes a large number of 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinones as having antimalarial activity. A number of these compounds have also been described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 2 553 648. Further classes of 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinones having activity as antimalarial, anticoccidial and/or antitheilerial agents are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3 367 830, and 3 347 742, U.K. Patent Specification No. 1553424, and European Patent Specifications Nos. 2 228, 77551, 77550 and 123,238.<br>
European Patent No. 123,238 discloses 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinones which are said to be active against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and also against Eimeria species such as E. tenella and E.acervulina, which are causative organisms of coccidiosis. 2-Substituted-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinones(l) have been described in literature as possessing anti-protozoal activity, in particular anti-malarial. Anti-coccicidal activity has also been reported to a lesser extend. Hundreds of such compounds as possessing anti-malarial activity have been disclosed by Feiser and coworkers. All these compounds use 2-chloro-l,4-naphthoquinone(2) as one of the starting materials.<br><br><br>

(2)	(3)	0=C-OH (4)<br><br>
Synthesis of 2-chloro-l,4-naphthoquinone in the laboratory always resulted in a mixture of monochloro and dichloronaphthoquinone i.e. 2-Chloro and 2,3-Dichloronaphthoquinones. Material procured from market was also found to contain almost 10-12% of 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone(3). The preparation of pure 2-chloronaphthoquinone from this material is tedious and results in loss, making it expensive. Prior art has used the condensation of trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid(4) with 2-chloro-l, 4-naphthoquinone(2) to give 2-chloro-3-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone(5) which on hydrolysis yielded Atovaquone (6). We have however found that condensation of trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid(4) with the abundantly available, commercially inexpensive 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone(3) gave an improved yield of 2-chloro-3-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone(5) which on hydrolysis yielded Atovaquone (6).<br>

The napthoquinone compounds of Formula II, selected from 2-cyclohexyl-3-halo-l,4-naphthoquinones or substituted cyclohexyl derivatives thereof, may then be optionally used to prepare 2-cyclohexyl -1,4-naphthoquinones compounds of Formula III.<br><br>
FORMULA (in)<br>
wherein R3 is defined as above and R4 is selected from the group comprising hydroxyl; a group OCOR5, wherein R5 is a C1-10 alkyl group, a C3-10 cycloalkyl group, a C1-10 alkoxy group, or a phenyl or naphthyl group, each such R5 group being optionally substituted e. g. by amino, mono-or di-C 1-4 alkylamino, carboxy or hydroxy; a group OR6 or SR6, wherein R6 is an optionally substituted C1-10 alkyl, C1-10 cycloalkyl, phenyl or naphthyl group as defined for R5; or a group NR7R8, wherein R7 and Rs each independently represent hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, or the group NR7R8 represents a 5-7 membered saturated heterocyclic ring, which may optionally contain a further heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur; and physiologically acceptable salts and other physiologically functional derivatives thereof.<br>
Some non-limiting examples of compounds of Formula III include:<br><br><br>
2-[trans-4-(4-Chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Atovaquone); 2-Cyclohexyl-3-hydroxy 1,4-naphthoquinone (Parvaquone) and ; 2-trans-(4-t-Butylcyclohexyl)-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone.<br>
The 2,3-dihalonaphthoquinone compounds of Formula I is treated with a cyclohexane carboxylic acid or any substituted derivative thereof in the presence of silver nitrate and ammonium persulphate to give the napthoquinone compounds of Formula II selected from 2-cyclohexyl-3-halo-l,4-naphthoquinones or substituted cyclohexyl derivatives thereof. The napthoquinone compounds of Formula II, may be further converted to 2-cyclohexyl -1,4-naphthoquinones compounds of Formula III using various reagents known in the art. For example the napthoquinone compounds of Formula II may be hydrolyzed with potassium hydroxide to give 2-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxyl-1,4-naphthoquinones compounds.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds for use according to the present invention includes use of 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone for the preparation of 2-chloro-3-trans-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone and subsequently of 2-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone (Atovaquone).<br>
In the course of our investigations on the synthesis of Atovaquone (6) we found surprisingly that the condensation of trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexane carboxylic acid (4) with the abundantly available, commercially inexpensive 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone (3) in the presence of silver nitrate and ammonium perdisulphate gave a reasonable yield of 2-chloro-3-trans-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone (5) which on hydrolysis yielded Atovaquone (6). Since position 3 in 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone was occupied by a chlorine atom, it was not anticipated that it would be displaced by a substituted cyclohexyl group. This surprising finding led us to a systematic study of the reaction using pure 2,3-dichloro naphthoquinone (3) and different mixtures of this with 2-chloronaphthoquinone (2). Table 1 summarizes the results with yields of 2-chloro-3-trans -[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone (5) and Atovaquone (6). The table shows clearly that mixtures of 2-chloro-l,4-naphthoquinone (2) and 2,3-dichloro naphthoquinone (3) particularly in the range of (3) : (2) = 9 : 1 to 1 : 9 gave better yields of 2-chloro-3-trans-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-l,4-naphthoquinone (5) and hence of Atovaquone (6) when compared to the use of 2-chloronaphthoquinone (2) or 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone (3) alone. Since the preparation of pure 2-chloronaphthoquinone<br><br><br>
goes through a crude product which contains at least 10% 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone, the process of our invention allows the direct use of this crude mixture.<br>

The 2, 3-dichloronaphthoquinone was found to give a product with lesser impurities, for example, from the 2-chloronaphthoquinone reaction, the solid product obtained from the reaction was found to consist of 55-75% of the trans isomer(5), 10-20% of the cis- isomer and 3-7% of an unknown impurity. On the other hand, the solid product from the reaction using 2,3-dichloronaphthoquinone had &gt;90% of the trans isomer (5), 
The following examples are intended to illustrate the scope of the present invention in all its aspects but not to limit it thereto.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br><br>
1. 2-|trans-4-(4-Chlorophenyl)cvclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone (Atovaquone):<br>
Stage 1: Synthesis of 2-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-chloro-l,4-naphthoquinone (5)<br><br><br><br><br>
CI<br><br><br>
A mixture of 2, 3-dichloro-l,4-naphthoquinone (5gm), 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (6.06 gm) and silver nitrate (2.47 gm) was taken in acetonitrile (60 ml) and the mixture was heated to reflux, maintaining good stirring. Then a solution of ammonium persulphate (14.23 gm) in water (77 ml) was added through a dropping funnel over a period of 1 - 2 hrs. The mixture was refluxed for 4 hrs. Then it was cooled in ice for about 1 hr after which it was filtered. The solid was extracted with hot methylene chloride (100 ml x 3). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated to get light brownish yellow solid. This on crystallization from acetonitrile afforded the trans compound as yellow crystals (1.5 gm).<br>
Melting point, IR, NMR etc. fully matched with the product obtained from monochloro naphthoquinone. The same procedure was adopted for all the remaining five composition reported in Table-1.<br>
Stage II. 2-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-l,4-naphthoquinone<br><br><br>
(Atovaquone) (6)<br><br><br>
(5)<br>
Product from stage I (1.5gm) was taken in methanol and under stirring, potassium hydroxide (1.52 gm) dissolved in water (15 ml) was added over a period of 15 - 20 minutes, dropwise. The mixture was then refluxed approximately for 6 - 7 hrs. During this period the mixture became dark red. The mixture was then cooled in ice and concentrated hydrochloric acid (5.4 ml) was added dropwise to get yellow solid, which is filtered and washed thoroughly with water. The product after crystallization from methanol-acetic acid afforded the title compound as trans isomer (750 mg).<br>
Melting point, IR, NMR matched with the product obtained from monochloro naphthoquinone.<br>

A mixture of 2,3-dichloro-l,4-naphthoquinone (5gm), 4-t-butylcyclohexane carboxylic acid (2.7629 gm) and silver nitrate (2.095 gm) was taken in acetonitrile (60 ml) and the mixture was heated to reflux. Then a solution of ammonium persulphate (12.06 gm) in 77 ml of water was added through a dropping funnel over a period of 1 to 2 hrs. The mixture was refluxed for 4 hrs and cooled in ice for about I hr after which it was filtered. The solid was extracted with hot methylene chloride (100 ml x 3). The methylene chloride layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, concentrated to get light brownish yellow solid. This on crystallization from acetonitrile afforded the title compound as yellow crystals (2.5 gm). 300 MHz NMR of the compound fully agreed with the desired compound<br><br><br>
