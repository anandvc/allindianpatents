				<td>PREPARATION OF STERICALLY HINDERED HYDROXYPHENYLCARBOXYLIC<br>
ACID ESTERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) Field of the Invention:<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for preparing a chemical<br>
composition, and more particularly, to a process for preparing sterically hindered<br>
hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters, as well as to compositions containing the<br>
same.<br>
(2) Description of Related Art:<br>
[0002] Many organic materials, such as polymers, fuels, and lubricants, are<br>
susceptible to oxidative and thermal deterioration from the action of heat, mechanical<br>
stress, and chemical reagents (such as atmospheric oxygen or metallic impurities).<br>
Deterioration of lubricants may result in an increase in their total acidity, formation of<br>
gums, discoloration, loss of physical properties such as viscosity, decreased<br>
potency, increasing molecular weight, polymerization, and the creation of odor.<br>
Changes in these properties can cause the lubricant to lose its effectiveness and<br>
longevity.<br>
[0003] Oxidative degradation of a lubricant is a sequential process involving<br>
initiation, propagation, and termination phases. The initiation phase can begin by the<br>
formation of free radicals, which may be produced in a number of ways. For<br>
example, free radicals may be formed by reactive peroxides that are present during<br>
production of the lubricant, by thermal, mechanical or radiation stresses that occur<br>
during processing or end use, or by chemical reactions with impurities contained in<br>
the lubricant.<br>
[0004] During the propagation phase, the free radicals can react with oxygen to<br>
form peroxy (RO2) and alkoxy (RO) radicals which, in turn, may abstract hydrogen<br>
from the lubricant to form unstable hydroperoxides (R 02H), alcohols (ROH), and<br>
new hydrocarbon free radicals (R). These free radicals can once again combine with<br>
oxygen to continue the oxidative cycle until the process slows or stops completely<br>
during the termination phase.<br>
[0005] Lubricants are also subject to thermal degradation when used during<br>
periods of elevated temperatures or during periods of rapid cycling between elevated<br>
and low temperatures. Thermal degradation of a lubricant results in the disruption of<br>
long-chain hydrocarbons and causes the formation of unstable hydrocarbon<br>
compounds. These unstable compounds are especially prone to oxidation and can<br>
polymerize to form resins and sludge in the lubricant. For example, as an engine<br>
goes through multiple heating and cooling cycles, this sludge can harden and cause<br>
problems such as restricted passageways and decreased component tolerances.<br>
[0006] One way to interrupt these destructive processes is to incorporate a<br>
stabilizer such as an antioxidant into the lubricant composition. Generally known<br>
antioxidants, such as hindered phenolic compounds, may be used to retard thermal<br>
and oxidative degradation. Such hindered phenolic compounds donate an active<br>
hydrogen atom to the oxidative free radicals formed during the initiation and<br>
propagation phases to ensure that the termination phase is reached quickly.<br>
[0007] Unfortunately, while hindered phenol antioxidants are effective for<br>
combating the destructive effects of oxidation and thermal breakdown in lubricants,<br>
they are notoriously difficult to synthesize efficiently and in highly pure form.<br>
Conventional methods for the production of hindered phenol derivatives, particularly<br>
esters of phenols, often involve costly and time-consuming multi-step reaction<br>
procedures. These procedures usually require complicated isolation procedures for<br>
distilling the hindered phenol methyl ester intermediate and/or time-consuming and<br>
costly water washing steps to remove the unused or used catalysts (referred to<br>
herein as "catalyst residue") during the production process.<br>
[0008] For example, typical methods for preparing some hindered phenol<br>
antioxidants involve a Michael reaction between alkylphenols and an alkyl acrylate<br>
such as methyl acrylate, followed by extensive water washing and isolation of the<br>
resultant intermediate ester. Michael reactions are base-catalyzed conjugate<br>
additions of carbon nucleophiles (donors) to activated unsaturated compounds<br>
(acceptors). For the preparation of antioxidants, the Michael reaction donor is<br>
usually an alkylphenol compound and the acceptor is an unsaturated alkyl acrylate.<br>
[0009] After formation of the intermediate ester through the Michael reaction, the<br>
intermediate ester is then subjected to a second step involving transesterification,<br>
followed once again by extensive washing and then purification of the solid<br>
antioxidant. Typically, the solid product is purified by crystallization and filtration.<br>
[00010] In some methods, the separate transesterification step can be omitted if a<br>
suitable alcohol is incorporated into the alkylphenol/alkyl acrylate reaction. While<br>
such single-step reactions have advantages over multi-step preparation methods,<br>
such single-step reactions continue to have their disadvantages, particularly with<br>
respect to end-product purity,<br>
[00011] To accelerate reaction rates, a base catalyst is usually added during both<br>
the Michael reaction and transesterification steps. Often, different catalysts at each<br>
step must be employed to achieve acceptable reaction times. Before the final<br>
antioxidant product can be isolated, however, all of the catalyst residue must be<br>
removed or the catalysts will contaminate the resulting antioxidant and, therefore,<br>
any lubricant made with the antioxidant.<br>
[00012] Typically, the base catalysts are removed by first neutralizing them with<br>
acids such as acetic, hydrochloric or sulfuric. The antioxidant product is then<br>
precipitated away from the catalyst and filtration is used to separate the final product<br>
from the catalyst. However, catalysts are difficult to remove and cannot always be<br>
removed completely from the final product. In particular, while filtration may be<br>
suitable for the preparation of solid antioxidants, it is inappropriate and impractical for<br>
purifying liquid antioxidants.<br>
[00013] One way to assist in the catalyst removal is through the use of extensive<br>
water washings of the reaction products at the end of each step. However, water<br>
washes slow down the overall time required to complete the antioxidant synthesis<br>
and add greatly to the inefficiency of these processes. Other reported methods to<br>
neutralize the catalyst generate large amounts of byproduct solids and lead to a<br>
waste disposal issue.<br>
[00014] Improvements have been sought in many different reported procedures for<br>
producing a hindered phenolic compound. These procedures, however, do not<br>
adequately address all of the problems that arise from the making of hindered<br>
phenolic compounds.<br>
[00015] For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,085,132 to Park, et al. describes a onestep<br>
method of producing higher molecular weight hindered phenolic esters.<br>
According to this method, methyl acrylate is gradually added to a reaction mixture<br>
comprising 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (which is a higher molecular weight monohydric<br>
hindered phenol), a high molecular weight alcohol, and a catalyst, without isolating<br>
the intermediate in a separate step. Higher excesses of methyl acrylate are required<br>
in order to drive this type of reaction to completion. The catalysts employed are<br>
alkaline metal catalysts of lithium, sodium and potassium. Catalyst neutralization is<br>
performed with acetic acid, which may not be effective for a water wash-free product<br>
isolation. The hindered phenol ester product is isolated as a solid by crystallization<br>
or recrystallization from the neutralized reaction mixture.<br>
[00016] While such a method works well for solids, it is inappropriate and<br>
impractical for washing liquid hindered phenol products. Moreover, this type of<br>
isolation leads to significant yield loss of product in the filtrate and can result in high<br>
levels of impurities.<br>
[00017] U.S. Patent No. 4,228,297 to Haeberli, et a/. on the other hand, describes<br>
one of the two-step methods where the Michael reaction is performed with one<br>
catalyst and the transesterification reaction is performed with a second catalyst that<br>
has a different chemical composition than the first catalyst. Again, the hindered<br>
phenol ester product is isolated as a solid by crystallization from the neutralized<br>
reaction mixture. All neutralizations are performed with acetic acid and all products<br>
are isolated by filtration. Again, this method is not practical for production and<br>
purification of liquid hindered phenol products.<br>
[00018] Another example of a one-step reaction is set forth in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,840,585 to Yamada, et at., wherein an alkyl acrylate is reacted with an alkylphenol<br>
to produce the final product. The patent describes the use of complex metal<br>
hydrides as catalysts. Such complex metal hydrides are very difficult to handle and<br>
to remove from the product but the process attempts to remove them by using acetic<br>
acid for neutralization. The reaction requires a promoter that is removed from the<br>
finished product by diluting the product with large volumes of toluene and then<br>
subsequently washing with water.<br>
[00019] A method for the production of a hindered phenol methyl ester by the very<br>
rapid addition of methyl acrylate to the alkylphenol starting compound is described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,659,863 to Burton. However, hindered phenol alkyl ester products<br>
are not isolated in this patent. Acids that are suitable for catalyst neutralization<br>
according to this patent are acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid.<br>
[00020] U.S. Patent No. 3,247,240 to Meier, etai, describes using alkali metal<br>
bases as catalysts in the Michael reaction. A variety of alkyl acrylates are used and<br>
all of the examples demonstrate higher alcohol products isolated by crystallization.<br>
The methyl ester is isolated by distillation and the reaction mixtures are neutralized<br>
with hydrochloric acid, followed by water washes. Distillation and crystallization<br>
processes are costly, time consuming, and lead to yield losses.<br>
[00021] The one-step production method described in U.S. Patent No. 3,364,250<br>
to Dexter, etal., creates hindered phenolic compounds by substituting a higher alkyl<br>
acrylate for methyl acrylate. The catalyst is neutralized with hydrochloric acid and<br>
then removed through water wash steps and a distillation step. The hindered phenol<br>
product is isolated as a solid by crystallization from the neutralized reaction mixture.<br>
[00022] Another method for producing a hindered phenol methyl ester is described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 3,330,859 to Dexter, etal. The two-step method involves<br>
purification by distillation through which the higher alkyl esters are crystallized as a<br>
solid and then catalyst neutralization is carried out with acetic and hydrochloric acid.<br>
This method is inappropriate for liquid transesterified hindered phenolics.<br>
[00023] Finally, U.S. Patent No. 6,559,105 to Abraham, et a/., describes a Michael<br>
reaction that uses large amounts of magnesium silicate as an absorbent and filter aid<br>
to neutralize the potassium hydroxide catalyst. This process creates waste disposal<br>
issues due to the large volume of solids that are generated. For example,<br>
approximately 2.70% solids based on the weight of total phenolic ester product are<br>
produced.<br>
[00024] There are also several process patents that describe specifically the<br>
transesterification step, including, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,291,703 to<br>
Schaerfl, et ai, U.S. Patent No. 4,694,099 to Ahlfors, et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,081,280 to Takee, etal., U.S. Patent No. 5,136,082 to Dang, etal., U.S. Patent No.<br>
2,892,097 to Robertson, U.S. Patent No. 4,594,444 to Orban, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,536,593, and U.S. Patent No. 4,716,244 to Orban.<br>
[00025] The use of two different catalysts in such prior art processes is costly and<br>
ultimately requires the removal of both catalysts. Typically, these processes require<br>
repeated water washes to adequately remove the catalyst residue and purify the final<br>
product. Therefore, such processes are time-consuming.<br>
[00026] While one might believe that time can be saved by employing one of the<br>
prior art single-step processes where the transesterification reaction and the Michael<br>
reaction are carried out in the same reaction mixture, these processes generally<br>
result in longer overall reaction times. Moreover, in these simultaneous, single-step,<br>
reactions, larger excesses of methyl acrylate are required to run the reaction and a<br>
lower purity product is generally obtained.<br>
[00027] From the foregoing, it can be seen that a need exists for improved and<br>
more efficient methods for producing hindered phenols and, particularly, for<br>
producing sterically hindered phenol esters that can be used as antioxidants in<br>
compositions such as lubricants. It would also be useful to provide improved<br>
methods for producing hindered phenol antioxidants that do not rely on multiple<br>
catalyst additions and that do not require extensive water washing or difficult phase<br>
separation steps. Likewise, methods that offer improved processes for reducing the<br>
concentration of catalysts in the final hindered phenol product would also be<br>
desirable in that such products could be utilized as antioxidants for use in improved<br>
compositions such as better-formulated lubricants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00028] Briefly, the invention is directed to novel low cost and low waste<br>
manufacturing processes for producing hindered phenolic alkyl ester compounds. In<br>
general, several processes can be employed for producing the hindered phenolic<br>
alkyl ester compounds.<br>
[00029] For example, one two-step process involves reacting an alkyl<br>
acrylate, such as methyl acrylate, with an alkylphenol compound in the presence of a<br>
first catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate compound, then reacting an alcohol<br>
having at least 2 carbon atoms with the methyl ester intermediate compound in the<br>
presence of a second catalyst to form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound,<br>
neutralizing any catalyst residue with an aqueous phosphoric acid so as to form a<br>
precipitated phosphate salt, and then separating the precipitated phosphate salt from<br>
the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound. In one particular embodiment of this<br>
process, the first and second catalysts may have the same chemical composition<br>
and in other embodiments, the first and second catalysts may be different in that<br>
they have different chemical compositions. In still other embodiments, the second<br>
catalyst is not an additionally added catalyst but is instead merely a remainder of the<br>
first catalyst that is employed during the Michael reaction step involving the reaction<br>
of the alkyl acrylate and the alkylphenol. That is, the catalyst in the first Michael<br>
reaction is carried over, unaltered, and used to catalyze the second<br>
transesterification reaction. In this manner, the first catalyst is also used as the<br>
second catalyst during the reaction of the alcohol with the methyl ester intermediate<br>
compound.<br>
[00030] In another example, a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound is produced<br>
by reacting methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the presence of a first<br>
catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate compound. An alcohol is then reacted<br>
with the methyl ester intermediate compound in the presence of a second catalyst to<br>
form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound. In this particular embodiment, the<br>
second catalyst has the same chemical composition as the first catalyst and the<br>
catalysts are neutralized with an aqueous acid, which may or may not be phosphoric<br>
acid, to form a precipitated salt. Finally, the precipitated salt is separated from the<br>
hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound by filtration or decantation.<br>
[00031] Again, in certain embodiments of this reaction, the remainder of the first<br>
catalyst employed in the Michael reaction may be employed as the second catalyst<br>
in the transesterification reaction.<br>
[00032] As mentioned, the aqueous acid employed in this particular process may<br>
be selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrobromic acid,<br>
hydroiodic acid, hydrochloric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
[00033] In another embodiment, a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound may be<br>
produced in a single-step reaction by first reacting an alkyl acrylate with an<br>
alkylphenol compound in the presence of a catalyst to form the hindered phenolic<br>
alkyl ester compound and then neutralizing the catalyst residue with an aqueous<br>
phosphoric acid so as to form a precipitated phosphate salt. The precipitated<br>
phosphate salt is then separated from the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound<br>
by filtration or decantation.<br>
[00034] The compositions made according to the present process are particularly<br>
useful as antioxidants for lubricant compositions. In particular, lubricants such as<br>
passenger car engine oils, heavy duty diesel engine oils, railroad oils, natural gas<br>
engine oils, turbine oils, rust oils, oxidation oils, slideway oils, hydraulic oils, industrial<br>
oils, automotive gear oils, automatic transmission fluids and manual transmission<br>
fluids, tractor fluids, universal tractor fluids and hydraulic fluids, power steering fluids,<br>
gear lubricants, industrial oils, pump oils, and mixtures thereof, may all take<br>
advantage of the antioxidizing properties available from the presently-produced<br>
products.<br>
[00035] The inventive processes generally produce purified hindered phenolic<br>
esters, yet allow for the elimination of methyl ester intermediate purification, the use<br>
of the same catalyst (when two reactions are employed in the process), and<br>
elimination of the costly and time consuming water wash steps that have historically<br>
been used to remove catalyst residues.<br>
[00036] Use of phosphoric acid in certain embodiments to neutralize the catalyst<br>
residue also simplifies the catalyst removal process by allowing for filtration of the<br>
resulting metal phosphate salts formed by reaction of the catalyst with the<br>
phosphoric acid. Finished hindered phenolic ester products having less than 200<br>
ppm catalyst and less than 20 ppm phosphorous may typically be produced<br>
according to the present processes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00037] Reference now will be made in detail to the embodiments of the invention,<br>
one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by<br>
way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be<br>
made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the<br>
invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment,<br>
can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is<br>
intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects,<br>
features and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in or are obvious from<br>
the following detailed description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only, and<br>
is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention.<br>
[00038] In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that<br>
hindered phenolic compounds can be made according to the methods described<br>
herein. The phenolic compounds produced thereby make excellent antioxidants<br>
suitable for stabilizing organic materials, such as lubricants, that are sensitive to<br>
oxidative and/or thermal degradation.<br>
8<br>
[00039] Generally speaking, high molecular weight hindered phenols are among<br>
the applicable antioxidants synthesizable according to the methods described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "hindered phenol" or "hindered phenolic compound" refers<br>
to a phenol compound substituted with one or more substituent groups at its<br>
benzene ring. Hindered phenols are well known to those skilled in the art and may<br>
be characterized as phenolic compounds, which also contain sterically bulky radicals<br>
in close proximity to the phenolic hydroxyl group.<br>
[00040] By way of example, tertiary butyl groups may be substituted onto the<br>
benzene ring in at least one of the ortho positions relative to the phenolic hydroxyl<br>
group. The presence of these sterically bulky substituted radicals in the vicinity of<br>
the hydroxyl group serves to retard the hindered phenol's stretching frequency and,<br>
correspondingly, its reactivity. This steric hindrance provides the phenolic compound<br>
with its stabilizing properties when it acts as an antioxidant.<br>
[00041] The hindered phenolic esters of the present invention can be prepared by<br>
several different methods. One such method involves a two-step reaction. The first<br>
step is a Michael reaction of a hindered phenol such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol with<br>
an alkyl acrylate such as methyl acrylate in the presence of a catalyst and,<br>
optionally, a promoter, to produce an intermediate phenol alkyl ester. The second<br>
step is a transesterification reaction between the intermediate phenol alkyl ester and<br>
an alcohol. This aspect of the present invention employs the same type of catalyst in<br>
both the Michael and in the transesterification reaction, either as two separatelyadded<br>
catalysts or as a single-added catalyst that is used in the first reaction and is<br>
then carried over for use in the second reaction.<br>
[00042] Utilization of the same type of catalyst in both the transesterification and<br>
Michael reactions that occur during formation of the hindered phenolic esters in a<br>
two-step process represents an improvement over known processes. As mentioned<br>
previously, many prior two-step processes utilize different catalysts for the<br>
transesterification and Michael reactions. Other prior processes may utilize the<br>
same catalysts for both reactions, but these processes allow the transesterification<br>
and Michael reactions to occur at the same time in a single-step process. When<br>
these processes are conducted, the attendant disadvantages discussed above<br>
result. In particular, as previously suggested, both of these prior art processes are<br>
undesirable from an efficiency and product purity standpoint.<br>
[00043] In addition, in the present invention, the catalyst is removed by first<br>
neutralizing with an aqueous acid, such as aqueous phosphoric acid, and then<br>
removing excess water, and, finally, filtering to remove the precipitated phosphate<br>
salts. By removing the catalyst in this fashion, the present invention eliminates the<br>
need for water wash and slow phase separation steps and avoids having to purify<br>
the final product through distillation, which allows for a shortening of the overall<br>
process completion time.<br>
[00044] Additionally, the removal of the aqueous acid-precipitated catalyst by<br>
means of a filtration step allows the process to occur while the hindered phenol<br>
antioxidants are in a liquid state. This is an improvement over conventional<br>
processes which typically do not allow for the production and purification of hindered<br>
phenol antioxidants in a liquid form.<br>
[00045] Finally, by removing the catalyst through a neutralization step with an<br>
aqueous acid such as phosphoric acid, the total amount of waste solids produced is<br>
less than the amount created through known process. For example, the methods of<br>
the present invention typically generate waste solids on the order of between about<br>
0.65% and 1.02% by weight based on the phenolic ester product. By comparison,<br>
other reported methods generate as much as 2.70% solids.<br>
[00046] The Michael reaction is performed, in one embodiment, by adding methyl<br>
acrylate to a solution of a hindered phenol (e.g., an alkylphenol such as 2,6-di-tertbutylphenol),<br>
a promoter and a catalyst in a reaction vessel. For example, a reaction<br>
quantity of an alkylphenol, such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, is heated to between<br>
about 60°C and 65°C or higher under vacuum to purge oxygen from the reaction<br>
vessel. The entire reaction may be carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas such as<br>
a partial or full nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
[00047] If the alkylphenol is in a solid form prior to being used in the process, it is<br>
first melted in order to render it liquid. After the alkylphenol is melted, the desired<br>
catalyst is then added. Next, an optional promoter may be added. Optionally, water<br>
added to the reaction with the catalyst may be removed by distillation, by vacuum<br>
distillation, or as a toluene azeotrope prior to the Michael addition step. This can be<br>
accomplished by adding toluene to the alkylphenol and heating the mixture to<br>
between about 130°C and about 160°C and collecting the water/toluene azeotrope in<br>
a Dean-Stark trap. The mixture is then heated to a reaction temperature and the<br>
methyl acrylate is added. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature of<br>
between 80°C and 150°C and, more particularly, to a temperature between 100°C<br>
and 130 °C.<br>
[00048] Generally, about equimolar portions of methyl acrylate and alkylphenol<br>
reactants are used, with the overall molar ratio of methyl acrylate to alkylphenol<br>
typically being at least about 1:1. However, either of the methyl acrylate or<br>
alkylphenol may be used in excess according to the process of the invention. In<br>
certain embodiments, a slight excess of methyl acrylate may be employed so that<br>
the molar ratio of methyl acrylate to alkylphenol is between about 1.05:1 to about<br>
1.30:1 (i.e., so that the methyl acrylate molar excess is between about 5% and about<br>
30% above the molar amount of the alkylphenol). In certain embodiments, a slight<br>
excess of alkylphenol may be employed so that the molar ratio of alkylphenol to<br>
methyl acrylate is between about 1.05:1 to about 1.30:1 (i.e., so that the alkylphenol<br>
molar excess is between about 5% and about 30% above the molar amount of the<br>
methyl acrylate). For example, in one embodiment, an alkyl phenol molar excess of<br>
about 10% to about 15% can be used.<br>
[00049] The time for addition of the methyl acrylate is not critical to the operability<br>
of the present invention and can be carried out over a time period of between about<br>
15 minutes and about 8 hours. After the methyl acrylate addition is complete, the<br>
reaction is then extended for an additional 1 to 24 hours, depending on the reaction<br>
temperature selected. One skilled in the art will understand that lower reaction<br>
temperatures will require longer reaction times. The reaction is considered complete<br>
when less than 2 weight % ("wt. %"), or in some embodiments less than 1 wt. %, of<br>
the starting hindered phenol reactant remains.<br>
[00050] By way of example, the product of a Michael reaction between methyl<br>
acrylate and 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is the hindered phenol methyl ester intermediate,<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester.<br>
[00051] The transesterification reaction is carried out by reacting the chosen<br>
molecular weight alcohol with the hindered phenol methyl ester intermediate<br>
produced in the Michael reaction. The transesterification reaction converts the<br>
methyl ester intermediate to a higher molecular weight alkyl ester. The<br>
transesterification reaction is performed at a temperature sufficient to collect the<br>
methanol by-product and to drive the reversible reaction to completion.<br>
 [00052] During the transesterification reaction, a catalyst can also be present to<br>
accelerate the reaction. The chemical composition of the catalyst used in the<br>
transesterification reaction has desirably the same chemical composition as the<br>
catalyst used in the Michael reaction. This can be achieved by simply not washing<br>
or not purifying away the first catalyst addition to the Michael reaction and then,<br>
optionally if necessary, adding back to the reaction mixture some of the same<br>
catalyst. In the alternative, this can be achieved by purifying away the first catalyst<br>
addition during the Michael reaction, and subsequently, adding back the identical<br>
type of catalyst to the transesterification reaction. Keeping the catalyst the same<br>
between the Michael reaction and the transesterification reaction improves the<br>
overall efficiency and quality of the production, while at the same time reducing<br>
costs.<br>
[00053] By way of example, the reaction of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester with 2-ethylhexanol will produce 3,5-di-tertbutyl-<br>
4-hydrohydroxycinnamic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester. In this reaction, it is<br>
advantageous to use alcohols between certain molecular weight ranges. For<br>
example, alcohols that have low boiling points are difficult to drive the reaction to<br>
completion. Thus, the transesterification reaction of the present invention typically<br>
uses high molecular weight alcohols. As used herein, the terms "high molecular<br>
weight alcohol" refer to alcohols that are at least about a CB alcohol or greater (e.g.,<br>
alcohols that have at least 5 carbons or more). In some embodiments, the alcohol is<br>
a C5-C25 alcohol.<br>
[00054] Suitable alcohols for the reaction include, but are not limited to, primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary alcohols that can be linear or branched alcohols. Other<br>
alcohols include the polyhydric alcohols. By way of example, alcohols that are<br>
suitable for use with the present invention may comprise at least one alcohol that is<br>
selected from the group consisting of hexanol, heptanol, octanol, nonanol, decanol,<br>
undecanol, dodecanol, tridecanol, tetradecanol, cosanol, docosanol, tricosanol,<br>
tetracosanol, pentacosanol, hexacosanol, heptacosanol, linear and branched forms<br>
thereof, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00055] The transesterification reaction can be conducted at elevated pressures,<br>
normal atmospheric pressure, or sub-atmospheric pressures. In general, the<br>
transesterification reaction may be conducted at sub-atmospheric pressures, for<br>
example, in the range of from about 1 mm Hg to about 400 mm Hg. In this way, the<br>
vaporization of the lower alkanol (e.g., methanol) formed is facilitated during the<br>
course of the transesterification reaction. Removal of the lower alkanol during<br>
transesterification helps to drive the transesterification reaction towards completion.<br>
[00056] In one embodiment, the two-step method of the present invention provides<br>
a method for the production of a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound that<br>
includes reacting methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the presence of a<br>
first catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate compound, reacting an alcohol<br>
having at least 2 carbon atoms with the methyl ester intermediate compound in the<br>
presence of a second catalyst to form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound,<br>
neutralizing the catalyst residue with an aqueous phosphoric acid so as to form a<br>
precipitated phosphate salt, and separating the precipitated phosphate salt from the<br>
hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound.<br>
[00057] In other embodiments, the two-step method of the present invention<br>
provides a method for the production of a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound<br>
that includes reacting methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the presence<br>
of a first catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate compound, reacting an alcohol<br>
having at least 2 carbon atoms with the methyl ester intermediate compound in the<br>
presence of a second catalyst to form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound,<br>
wherein the second catalyst has the same chemical composition as the first catalyst,<br>
neutralizing the first and second catalysts with an aqueous acid so as to form a<br>
precipitated salt, and separating the precipitated salt from the hindered phenolic alkyl<br>
ester compound.<br>
[00058] In still other embodiments, the two-step method of the present invention<br>
provides a method for the production of a hindered phenolic alkyl ester that avoids<br>
the need for a water wash step or a distillation step. For example, in this<br>
embodiment, the method essentially includes only the following steps: reacting<br>
methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the presence of a first catalyst to<br>
form a methyl ester intermediate compound, reacting an alcohol having at least 2<br>
carbon atoms with the methyl ester intermediate compound in the presence of a<br>
second catalyst to form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound, wherein the<br>
second catalyst has the same chemical composition as the first catalyst, neutralizing<br>
the first and second catalysts with an aqueous acid so as to form a precipitated salt,<br>
and separating the precipitated salt from the hindered phenolic alkyl ester<br>
compound.<br>
 [00059] The two-step production method of the present invention also provides a<br>
method for the production of a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound having the<br>
structure according to Formula I:<br>
wherein:<br>
R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and arylalkyl;<br>
n is 2;<br>
m is 1, 2, 3, or 4; and<br>
Z is alkyl;<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a) reacting methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the presence of a<br>
first catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate compound, wherein the alkylphenol<br>
compound has the structure according to Formula II:<br>
and wherein R1 and R2 are defined as above;<br>
b) reacting an alcohol having at least 2 carbon atoms with the methyl ester<br>
intermediate compound in the presence of a second catalyst to form the hindered<br>
phenolic alkyl ester compound having the structure according to Formula 1;<br>
c) neutralizing the catalyst residue with an aqueous phosphoric acid so as to<br>
form a precipitated phosphate salt; and<br>
d) separating the precipitated phosphate salt from the hindered phenolic alkyl<br>
ester compound.<br>
[00060] In one embodiment, R1 and R2 are both alkyl. In another embodiment, R1<br>
and R2 are independently selected from butyl and d-Ce alkyl. In yet another<br>
embodiment, R1 and R2 are t-butyl.<br>
[00061] Alternatively, Z is a CrCio alkyl, and in further embodiments, Z is selected<br>
from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, heptyl, isoheptyl,<br>
octyl, isooctyl, and 2-ethylhexyl.<br>
[00062] As used herein, when the term "alkyl" is used, either alone or within other<br>
terms such as "haloalkyl" and "alkylsulfonyl"; it embraces linear or branched radicals<br>
composed of carbon atoms. The number of carbon atoms can also be expressed as<br>
"CrCs", for example. Examples of such radicals include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isoamyl, hexyl, octyl and the<br>
like. When an alkyl radical, such as, for example," butyl" is used, it is intended that<br>
all primary, secondary and tertiary forms of the alkyl radical are encompassed by the<br>
term, including n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl and sec-butyl.<br>
[00063] The terms "hydrido", "-H", or "hydrogen", denote a single hydrogen atom<br>
(H). This hydrido radical may be attached, for example, to an oxygen atom to form a<br>
hydroxyl radical, or two hydrido radicals may be attached to a carbon atom to form a<br>
methylene (-CH2 -) radical.<br>
[00064] The term "aryl", alone or in combination, means a carbocyclic aromatic<br>
system containing carbon rings wherein such rings may be attached together in a<br>
pendent manner or may be fused. The term "aryl" embraces aromatic radicals such<br>
as phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronapthyl, indane, and biphenyl.<br>
[00065] The terms "aralkyl", or "arylalkyl" embrace aryl-substituted alkyl radicals<br>
such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, phenethyl, and diphenethyl.<br>
[00066] In the naming of substituent groups for general chemical structures, the<br>
naming of the chemical components of the group is typically from the terminal group-<br>
toward the parent compound unless otherwise noted, as discussed below. In other<br>
words, the outermost chemical structure is named first, followed by the next structure<br>
in line, followed by the next, etc. until the structure that is connected to the parent<br>
structure is named.<br>
[00067] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a two-step method<br>
for the production of a hindered phenolic alkyl ester compound having the structure<br>
wherein:<br>
R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and arylalkyl;<br>
n is 2;<br>
m is 1, 2, 3, or 4; and<br>
Z is alkyl;<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a) reacting methyl acrylate with an alkylphenol compound in the<br>
presence of a first catalyst to form a methyl ester intermediate<br>
compound, wherein the alkylphenol compound has the structure<br>
according to Formula II:<br>
and wherein R1 and R2 are defined as above;<br>
b) reacting an alcohol having at least 2 carbon atoms with the methyl ester<br>
intermediate compound in the presence of a second catalyst to form the hindered<br>
phenolic alkyl ester compound having the structure according to Formula I, wherein<br>
the second catalyst has the same chemical composition as the first catalyst;<br>
c) neutralizing the first and second catalysts with an aqueous acid so as to<br>
form a precipitated salt; and<br>
d) separating the precipitated salt from the hindered phenolic alkyl ester<br>
compound.<br>
[00068] Another method suitable for use as the present invention involves reacting<br>
an alkylphenol, such as 2, 6-di-tert-butylphenol, with a specific alkyl acrylate in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, an alcohol and, optionally, a promoter in one step. The<br>
catalyst is then neutralized with an aqueous acid such as phosphoric acid so as to<br>
form a precipitated salt which is then separated from the ester. In this method, the<br>
product produced is the final product, thus eliminating the need for a<br>
transesterification reaction step.<br>
[00069] For this "one-step" reaction, the same catalysts and promoters can be<br>
used as those described for the "two-step" methyl acrylate reaction. In one<br>
embodiment, the alkyl acrylate that is suitable for the one-step reaction is methyl<br>
acrylate. In other embodiments, the alkyl acrylates that are suitable for the one-step<br>
reaction are those alkyl acrylates that are high molecular weight acrylates having a<br>
higher molecular weight than methyl acrylate. As used herein, the terms "high<br>
molecular" or "higher molecular" with respect to the weight of an alkyl compound<br>
means that the alkyl chain is longer than methyl. For example, in one embodiment,<br>
linear or branched higher molecular weight alkyl acrylates such as C2-C24 alkyl<br>
acrylates are suitable for use with the presently described "one-step" method. By<br>
way of example, such higher molecular weight acrylates include, but are not limited<br>
to, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, sec-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl<br>
acrylate, isooctyl acrylate, and the like.<br>
[00070] In some embodiments, the high molecular weight acrylates are linear or<br>
branched C2-C10 alkyl acrylates, and other embodiments, the C2-C10 alkyl acrylates<br>
comprise at least one compound that is selected from the group consisting of n-butyl<br>
acrylate, sec-butyl acrylate, n-octyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, isoheptyl acrylate,<br>
isooctyl acrylate, isononyl acrylate, isodecyl acrylate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00071] Generally speaking, the catalysts employed in the present processes may<br>
include, but are not limited to, alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and oxides<br>
including, but not limited to, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium<br>
hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide. Other<br>
suitable catalysts include, but are not limited to, alkali metal hydrides, alkali metal<br>
alkoxides, alkali metal amides, dibutyltin oxide, zinc salts, calcium salts,<br>
monoalkyltins, alkali metal hydrocarbyloxides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00072] The amount of alkali metal hydroxide catalyst used typically is based on<br>
the total amount of active hydrogens in the reactive hindered phenolic mixture. For<br>
example, although the catalysts may be employed in amounts ranging from 0.001 to<br>
10 mole % based on the alkylphenol compound, amounts of from about 1 to 5 mole<br>
% are usually employed, and, in some embodiments, about 2.5 mole % is employed.<br>
[00073] The neutralization step may be carried out in some embodiments with an<br>
aqueous acid and in some embodiments with a specific aqueous acid such as<br>
aqueous phosphoric acid. In some embodiments, concentrated phosphoric acid<br>
(14.6 M) is first diluted with water to make a diluted aqueous solution of phosphoric<br>
acid before adding the acid. Dilutions of concentrated phosphoric acid with water<br>
can range anywhere from 5% to 95% aqueous phosphoric acid. Other suitable<br>
dilutions can range from 10% to 80% aqueous phosphoric acid, and in some<br>
embodiments, the dilution can range from 17% to 20% aqueous phosphoric acid.<br>
The application of aqueous phosphoric acid in the present invention promotes the<br>
formation (i.e., precipitation) of crystalline metal phosphate salts that are easily<br>
removable from the final product by filtration.<br>
 [00074] The amount of aqueous acid (e.g., phosphoric acid) that is added to the<br>
reaction for catalyst neutralization is based on the amount of catalyst used which, in<br>
turn, corresponds to the amount of catalyst residue that is to be neutralized. In<br>
general, the reaction mixture contains a molar equivalent of the aqueous acid that is<br>
between about 30% and 200% the molar equivalent of the catalyst, and often the<br>
molar equivalent of the aqueous acid is between about 50% and 100% the molar<br>
equivalent of the catalyst. In many cases, the reaction mixture contains a molar<br>
equivalent of the aqueous acid that is between about 65% and about 95% the molar<br>
equivalent of the catalyst.<br>
[00075] The aqueous acid should be added to the hindered phenol alkyl ester<br>
reaction mixture when the mixture is at a temperature of between about 50°C and<br>
about 150°C, and typically, the aqueous acid is added to the reaction mixture when<br>
the mixture is at a temperature of about 100°C. The rate of aqueous acid addition is<br>
not critical to the process disclosed herein and will necessarily be adjusted based on<br>
the effectiveness of the neutralization reaction.<br>
[00076] For most reactions, the catalyst neutralization reaction is allowed to<br>
proceed for at least one hour, and in some cases, the neutralization proceeds for<br>
between about 2 and 3 hours. Completion of the catalyst neutralization can often be<br>
judged by the color change of the reaction mixture from an orange red to a yellow<br>
color.<br>
[00077] After the aqueous acid addition, the added water is removed by<br>
atmospheric distillation or vacuum distillation. As the added water is removed, the<br>
metal salts of the catalyst are formed (e.g., potassium phosphate). The resulting<br>
metal salts are often insoluble even in the hot phenolic adducts. The resulting salts<br>
are then separated away from the desired product by known methods including, but<br>
not limited to, filtration, centrifugation, decantation, and the like. A filter aid such as<br>
Celite® (e.g. Celite 545, Baker Analyzed Reagent) may be used to improve the rate<br>
of separation and the efficiency of metal salt removal.<br>
[00078] The process of the present invention produces a product that contains low<br>
levels of metal salts/ions, which may remain after neutralization of the base catalyst<br>
with an aqueous acid. The levels of metal salts/ions in the final isolated product may<br>
be less than about 200 ppm. In some embodiments, the levels of metal salts/ions in<br>
the final isolated product may be less than about 100 ppm, and in some<br>
embodiments, less than about 50 ppm. In still other embodiments, the levels of<br>
metal salts/ions in the final isolated product may be less than about 5 ppm. For<br>
example, if potassium hydroxide is used as the catalyst and phosphoric acid is used<br>
to neutralize the potassium hydroxide catalyst, then the final hindered phenol alkyl<br>
ester product may contain less than about 100 ppm potassium, and in some<br>
embodiments, less than about 50 ppm potassium. Likewise, the final hindered<br>
phenol alkyl ester product may contain less than about 20 ppm phosphorous, and in<br>
some embodiments, less than about 5 ppm phosphorous.<br>
[00079] The final water content of the reaction mix is often at least about 0.2 wt%<br>
of the total reaction mass. Advantageously, this means that very little water is used<br>
in the wash-free production process, which leaves essentially no trace of insoluble<br>
salts in the organic phase after filtration. By way of example, the water content of<br>
the final reaction mix is usually between about 0.2 to about 20 wt. % water of the<br>
reaction mass. In other embodiments, the water content of the reaction is usually<br>
between about 0.5 to about 10 wt. % water of the reaction mass, and in some cases,<br>
the water content is between about 1 to about 5 wt. % of the reaction mass.<br>
[00080] As mentioned above, an optional promoter may be used in the Michael<br>
reaction and/or during the transesterification reaction. Promoters are often used, but<br>
not always required, to improve reaction rate, improve the reaction conversion, and<br>
reduce the amount of undesirable impurities in the product.<br>
[00081] Typical promoters may be polar aprotic solvents. Other examples of<br>
promoters that are suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, dialkyl sulfoxides (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide ("DMSO")), dimethyl formamide<br>
("DMF"), dialkyl ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether), dimethyl acetamide,<br>
N,N-dialkyl acidamide, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, and mixtures<br>
thereof. In addition, phase transfer catalysts such as tris(3,6-dioxaheptyl)amine,<br>
which are also called TDA-1 phase transfer agents and are sold by Rhone-Poulenc,<br>
may also be used as a promoter. Various other phase transfer catalysts and aprotic<br>
solvents may also be used. Other classes of promoters include the crown ethers<br>
such as 1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclopentadecane (15-Crown-5); 1,4,7,10,13,16-<br>
hexaoxacyclooctadecane (18-Crown-6); 1,4,7,10-tetraoxacyclododecane (12-Crown-<br>
4); dibenzo-18-crown-6-dibenzyl-24-crown-8; dicyclohexano-18-crown-6;<br>
20<br>
dicyclohexano-24-crown-8; and the like. Another agent suitable for the invention is<br>
sulfolane(tetramethylenesulfone).<br>
[00082] In certain aspects of the present invention, the two-step method may<br>
incorporate a promoter in the Michael reaction and/or transesterification reaction that<br>
allows for the production of the hindered phenolic alkyl ester product in a<br>
substantially liquid form. In this embodiment, methyl acrylate is first reacted with an<br>
alkylphenol compound in the presence of a first promoter and a first catalyst to form<br>
a methyl ester intermediate compound. The intermediate compound is then reacted<br>
with an alcohol in the presence of an optional second promoter that may have the<br>
same chemical composition as the first promoter and that may have a different<br>
chemical composition than the first promoter. When the second promoter is present<br>
during the reaction of the alcohol with the methyl ester intermediate compound, the<br>
first promoter may also be used as the second promoter.<br>
[00083] For this two-step method, the intermediate compound can also be reacted<br>
with the alcohol in the presence of the same first catalyst or a different second<br>
catalyst in order to form the hindered phenolic alkyl ester product in a substantially<br>
liquid form. The catalysts may be neutralized with any suitable aqueous acid. For<br>
this particular two-step method, the hindered phenolic alkyl ester product will remain<br>
in a liquid form, even at room temperature.<br>
[00084] Likewise, the one-step method may incorporate a promoter during the<br>
reaction of an alkylphenol with an alkyl acrylate that allows for the production of the<br>
hindered phenolic alkyl ester product in a substantially liquid form. The catalyst for<br>
this particular one-step method may be neutralized with any suitable aqueous acid.<br>
[00085] In some embodiments, the one-step and two-step methods of the present<br>
invention incorporate tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the promoter for the Michael reaction<br>
and/or the transesterification reaction. THF provides certain advantages over the<br>
polar aprotic solvents in the reactions of the present invention. For the two-step<br>
reaction, THF can be easily removed from the Michael reaction and then recycled<br>
during the transesterification reaction, thus making the overall process more cost<br>
effective. This allows for effective recycling of the THF promoter, the methyl acrylate<br>
in the Michael reaction, and the alcohol in the transesterification reaction.<br>
[00086] By recycling efficiently, many of the associated manufacturing costs may<br>
be substantially reduced. This is especially true when C7 - C9 alcohols are<br>
employed. Likewise, the one-step reaction can also utilize THF as a promoter to<br>
improve the overall efficiency because THF can more easily be removed from the<br>
alcohol.<br>
[00087] In other embodiments of the invention, when THF is used as the promoter<br>
in the two-step method, different catalysts may be used during the Michael reaction<br>
and the transesterification reaction. Other advantages of using THF as the promoter<br>
in either or both of the Michael reaction and transesterification reaction include<br>
production of the hindered phenolic alkyl ester product as a solid or as a liquid. In<br>
addition, using THF in the one-step and two-step methods allows for neutralizing the<br>
base catalyst with any suitable aqueous acid.<br>
[00088] The amount of promoter used according to the invention may vary over a<br>
broad range with a suitable range for the amount of promoter being between about<br>
0.5 mole % to about 15.0 mole % of the alkylphenol reactant and, in other<br>
embodiments, being between about 1.0 mole % to about 10.0 mole % of the<br>
alkylphenol reactant. In still further embodiments, a suitable range for the amount of<br>
promoter is between about 3.0 mole % to about 7.0 mole % of the alkylphenol<br>
reactant and, in some instances, is about 5.5 mole % of the alkylphenol reactant.<br>
[00089] The present invention also encompasses novel hindered phenolic ester<br>
compositions, and in some embodiments, the present invention encompasses any<br>
one or more of the hindered phenolic compounds made according to any of the<br>
methods described herein. For example, in one embodiment, the present invention<br>
encompasses a composition comprising the following mixture of hindered phenolic<br>
esters:<br>
(a) 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, C4-Ci0 alkyl ester,<br>
(b) pentanedioic acid, 2-[[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]methyl] CrCi0<br>
dialkyl ester, and<br>
(c) 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester.<br>
[00090] In certain aspects of the invention, an optional 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol<br>
compound may also be present in the composition.<br>
[00091] The 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, C4-Cio alkyl ester may<br>
be present within the mixture of hindered phenolic esters in an amount that is<br>
detectable by gas chromatography and may have a gas chromatogram within the<br>
mixture of about 80.0% to about 98.0% by area, and in some embodiments, the 3,5-<br>
di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, C4-Ci0 alkyl ester may have a gas<br>
chromatogram within the mixture of about 90.0 to 97.0% by area. In other<br>
embodiments, the 3,5-di-tert-butyI-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, C4-Ci0 alkyl ester<br>
may have a gas chromatogram within the mixture of about 95.0 to 98.0% by area.<br>
[00092] In some embodiments, the 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
CrC-io alkyl ester comprises at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester,<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester,<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, n-butyl ester, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00093] The pentanedioic acid, 2-[[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl]methyl] CrC10<br>
dialkyl ester may be present within the mixture of hindered phenolic esters in an<br>
amount that is detectable by gas chromatography and may have a gas<br>
chromatogram within the mixture of, about 1.0% to about 20.0% by area, and in<br>
some embodiments, the pentanedioic acid, 2-[[3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>

made according to the methods of the present invention can be added to the<br>
materials to be stabilized in the form of a master batch which contains the<br>

emulsion polymers), as a dry mixture during the mixing of additional components or<br>
polymer mixtures, as a direct addition into the processing apparatus (e.g., extruder,<br>
kneader, etc.), or as a solution or melt. In one embodiment, the hindered phenolic<br>
compound is added to the materials to be stabilized in a substantially liquid form.<br>

invention as disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification, together with the<br>
examples, be considered to be exemplary only, with the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention being indicated by the claims which follow the examples. In the examples,<br>
all percentages are given on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[000117] This example demonstrates a two-step method for the production of 3,5-ditert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester, which is suitable for use as an<br>
antioxidant.<br>
[000118] Step 1: Michael reaction.<br>
[000119] A 1-liter round bottom Pyrex flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar,<br>
temperature probe, heating mantle, and total condenser for distillate removal was<br>
used. The flask was initially charged with 350.7 g of molten 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol<br>
("2,6-DTBP", 1.70 mol) at 40 to 50°C, 2.42 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) pellet,<br>
and 14.7 g of DMSO. The pressure was then reduced to 15 mm Hg and the<br>
temperature was increased from 40°C to 115°C over 70 minutes to remove the water<br>
by-product. The resulting white slurry was then cooled to 110°C.<br>
[000120] A water-cooled total reflux condenser and a 250-ml addition funnel<br>
containing 155.6 g of methyl acrylate were installed to the reactor. The methyl<br>
acrylate ("MA") was added dropwise over 30 minutes, during which the temperature<br>
of the reactor was allowed to rise from 110°C to 129°C. The reactor was heated<br>
further to 135°C in 6 minutes, then cooled to 110°C and held at 110°C for 170<br>
minutes. The red clear solution was analyzed by Gas Chromatography ("GC") and<br>
found to contain 1.2 area % 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol and 96.0 area % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-<br>
4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester. The pressure was then reduced to 20<br>
mm Hg, and the excess methyl acrylate was stripped at 110°C. The intermediate<br>
was analyzed by GC and found to contain 93.9 wt. % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester and 0.67 wt. % 2,6-DTBP. A 21.5 g portion<br>
of the 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester intermediate was<br>
used for physical property measurements.<br>
[000121] Step 2: Transesterification reaction.<br>
[000122] A Vigreux column equipped with an air-cooled partial condenser and a-<br>
15°C glycol-cooled total condenser was installed to the reactor. The remaining 3,5-<br>
di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester intermediate (-1.63 mol) was<br>
added with 225.8 g of isooctanol. The mixture was heated slowly from 65°C to<br>
176°C over 3.2 hours at a reduced pressure of 300 mm Hg initially to 60 mm Hg at<br>
end, during which approximately 65 ml of methanol distillate was collected in the trap<br>
receiver. The resulting reaction mass was found (by GC) to contain 2.7 area %<br>
isooctanol, 0.83 area % 2,6-DTBP, 0.81 area % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, and 94.8 area % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester.<br>
[000123] After removing the column and the air-cooled partial condenser, the<br>
excess isooctanol was stripped off at 5 mm Hg and 185°C. The resulting 3,5-di-tertbutyl-<br>
4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester crude product was found (by GC)<br>
to contain 0.35 area % isooctanol, 0.30 area % 2,6-DTBP, 0.68 area % 3,5-di-tertbutyl-<br>
4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, and 97.34 area % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-<br>
4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester.<br>
[000124] Step 3: Neutralization of the potassium catalyst with phosphoric acid.<br>
[000125] 7.156 g of 42.51 wt. % H3PO4 (31.0 mmol) in water and 31.7 g of additional<br>
water were added at 86°C to the above 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic<br>
acid, isooctyl ester solution, which contained 41.4 mmol of K catalyst. The mixture<br>
was kept at 86°C to 92°C for 38 minutes at atmospheric pressure. The temperature<br>
was then slowly raised from 88°C to 125°C and the pressure was reduced gradually<br>
to 20 mm Hg over 30 minutes to strip off the water (34.0 g collected). After cooling<br>
to 80°C, the precipitated solids were filtered in less than two minutes using a 9-cm<br>
Whatman-541 filter paper. The analytical results of the filtrate are given in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[000126] This example demonstrates another two-step method for the production of<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester, which is suitable for use<br>
as an antioxidant.<br>
[000127] Step 1: Michael reaction.<br>
[000128] A 12-liter round bottom Pyrex flask equipped with an overhead agitator,<br>
temperature probe, heating mantle, and a reflux condenser in series of a total<br>
condenser for distillate removal were used. The flask was initially charged with<br>
4126.4 g of molten 2,6-DTBP (20.0 mol) at 40 to 50°C, 28.1 g of KOH pellet (0.50<br>
mol), and 85.9 g of DMSO (1.1 mol). The pressure was then reduced to 20 mm Hg<br>
and the temperature was increased from 40°C to 126°C over 76 minutes to remove<br>
the water by-product. The resulting white slurry was then cooled to 110°C.<br>
[000129] Cooling water was then put to the jacket of the reflux condenser and 995.2<br>
g of methyl acrylate (11.56 mol) was then added dropwise from a 1000-ml funnel to<br>
the reactor over 37 minutes, during which time the reactor temperature was allowed<br>
to rise from 110°C to 117°C. A stream of nitrogen was injected between the heating<br>
mantle and the reactor wall to remove the heat. The dropping funnel was<br>
immediately recharged with an additional 847.4 g of methyl acrylate (9.84 mol),<br>
which was added dropwise to the reactor over 39 minutes, while the reactor<br>
temperature was allowed to increase to 130°C. The reactor temperature was then<br>
brought to 140°C over 10 minutes before cooling to 110°C over 25 minutes. After a<br>
110 minute hold at 110°C, the reaction mass was found to contain 1.58 area % 2,6-<br>
DTBP and 96.7 area % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester.<br>
The reaction mass was held for 30 minutes longer at 110°C, before the excess<br>
methyl acrylate was stripped off at 110°C and 20 mm Hg. The resulting 3,5-di-tertbutyl-<br>
4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester was analyzed by GC and found to<br>
contain 0.47 wt. % 2,6-DTBP and 94.85 wt. % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, and 1.75 area % diesters.<br>
[000130] Step 2: Transesterification reaction.<br>
[000131] The above-mentioned reflux condenser was packed with 4.5" S.S.<br>
Propak®, which improved the separation of MeOH from the isooctanol and DMSO.<br>
The 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester intermediate was<br>
added with 2,789.6 g of Isooctanol (21.42 mol). The mixture was heated slowly from<br>
71 °C to 166°C over 4.2 hours at 25 mm Hg, during which 661 g of methanol was<br>
collected in the trap receiver. After removing the reflux condenser, the excess<br>
isooctanol and DMSO (206.3 g collected) were stripped off at 5 mm Hg and 185°C.<br>
[000132] Step 3: Neutralization of the potassium catalyst with phosphoric acid.<br>
[000133] 132.2 g of water and 42.8 g of 85.8 wt. % H3PO4 (0.375 mol) in water<br>
was added at 70°C to the above 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
isooctyl ester solution, which contained 0.5 mol of K. The reactor temperature was<br>
kept at 70°C for one hour, increased to 100°C over 43 minutes, and held at 100°C<br>
for 30 minutes at nitrogen atmospheric pressure. Then, the reactor temperature was<br>
brought up from 100°C to 125°C over 62 minutes, while the pressure was reduced<br>
gradually to 20 mm Hg to strip off the water, during which solid precipitations were<br>
noted. After releasing the vacuum, the slurry was filtered via a medium fritted glass<br>
funnel. The analyses of the filtrate are given in Table 1. Analysis of the residual<br>
metal salts/ions in the final product was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma<br>
Atomic Emission Spectroscopy ("ICP").<br>
(Table Removed)EXAMPLE 3<br>
[000135] This example illustrates how an aqueous acid such as phosphoric acid can<br>
be used, in a process without the need to employ water washings, to produce a<br>
hindered phenolic ester product (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, butyl<br>
ester) that contains very low levels of potassium catalyst residues.<br>
[000136] For this example, 206.4 g of 2,6-DTBP (1.00 mol), 50.8 g toluene, and<br>
1.17 g KOH pellets (0.020 mol, 2.0 mol%) are charged into a 1 liter flask equipped<br>
with mechanical stirrer, connected to a Dean-Stark trap and under N2 atmosphere.<br>
The mixture is heated to 140 °C to remove water as a toluene azeotrope. A white<br>
slurry was obtained and 14.1 g of toluene was collected. Butyl acrylate (130.2 g,<br>
1.015 mol) was then added in one portion over two minutes to the white slurry. The<br>
Dean-Stark trap was removed and replaced by a cooling condenser. The resulting<br>
mixture was heated for 5 hours at 140°C, during which time 14 g toluene was<br>
collected and the resulting orange reaction mixture became a totally clear solution.<br>
GC analysis showed approximately 97% conversion of the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol.<br>
[000137] The mixture was allowed to cool down to 113°C before acidifying with 10 g<br>
of 17 wt. % H3PO4 (0.017 mol, approximately 87 mol % of theoretical potassium<br>
catalyst present) and mixed for approximately 1 hour. The excess toluene and water<br>
were then removed under reduced pressure at a temperature between room<br>
temperature and 140°C (pressure down to 4.5 torr). The resulting light yellow oil was<br>
filtered at about 120 °C over a celite bed (5 g) to remove potassium salts.<br>
Approximately 320 grams of product was obtained.<br>
[000138] GC wt. % analysis showed 95.4% 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, butyl ester and 2.8 % 2,6-DTBP. (ICP data: 2.3 ppm <br>
and 1 ppm P. Density: 0.9817 g/ml (@ 25 °C); Kinematic Viscosity: 65.9 (@ 40<br>
[000139] In this Example, the theoretical amount of potassium, if none were<br>
removed from the product, is approximately 2540 pprn. Therefore, greater than 99.9<br>
% of the potassium is removed according to method of this Example. Typically, 96.0<br>
to 100.0% of the potassium catalyst may be removed by the method of this Example.<br>
[000140] These results suggest that the wash-free neutralization of potassium<br>
counterions is an efficient tool and a viable alternative to aqueous wash and phase<br>
separation. Table 2 below summarizes the relationship between mol% added<br>
phosphoric acid (as a mol % of original KOH used) and the trace potassium and<br>
phosphorus in parts per million for various final phenolic alkyl ester products at<br>
varying amounts of KOH catalyst and aqueous phosphoric acid.<br>
(Table Removed) EXAMPLE 4<br>
[000142] This example illustrates the improvement obtained in producing hindered<br>
phenolic esters when a polar promoter is employed during the Michael reaction. As<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,085,132, hindered phenolic esters with low<br>
conversions and low purities may be produced. Furthermore, as known in the art,<br>
the addition of a polar promoter significantly improves the conversion and yield of the<br>
hindered phenolic ester to the point where the process can be used to produce liquid<br>
products or eliminate crystallization or distillation.<br>
 [000143] Reaction 1: The influence of having a polar promoter in the Michael<br>
reaction.<br>
[000144] The reaction of butyl acrylate with 2,6-DTBP at 120°C was monitored as a<br>
function of time in the presence of a DMSO promoter and with 2 mol % KOH as the<br>
alkaline catalyst. The GC results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>

reaction.<br>
[000146] The reaction of butyl acrylate with 2,6-DTBP at 120°C was monitored as a<br>
function of time using 2 mol % KOH as the alkaline catalyst. The GC results are<br>
shown in Table 3 below.<br>
(Table Removed) [000148] Without the presence of a polar promoter, such as DMSO, a purity of only<br>
89.4 % was achieved after 9 hours. After the reaction was conducted for 15 hours,<br>
the purity only improved to 93.7%. However, for purposes of the present invention, a<br>
15-hour reaction time is not cost effective or practical. For a solid product,<br>
crystallization can improve the purity of the 89.4 % reaction mixture. However, this<br>
would result in a significant yield loss. For a liquid product, the only purification<br>
option is a costly and time consuming distillation step. For the hindered phenolic<br>
compounds of the present invention, it has been found that improved conversion and<br>
purity may be achieved, while avoiding an expensive and time consuming distillation<br>
procedure.<br>
[000149] In the presence of a polar promoter, such as DMSO, a purity of 97.1 % is<br>
achieved after 9 hours. In fact, a purity of 95.1 % is achieved after only 4 hours<br>
when DMSO is present. This process, containing a DMSO promoter, now eliminates<br>
the need for crystallization (in the case of solids) or distillation (in the case of liquids).<br>
The purity of this product is such that it can be used in most lubricant applications.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[000150] This example demonstrates a one-step method for the production of 3,5-<br>
di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester, which is suitable for<br>
use as an antioxidant.<br>
[000151] More than a half dozen runs were carried out to identify the ideal reaction<br>
conditions for obtaining high purity ester. By using KOH as the catalyst, it was<br>
concluded that the presence of DMSO promoter roughly doubles the reaction rate<br>
under identical reaction conditions. Water is typically removed as a toluene<br>
azeotrope prior to the Michael addition step. The flask is heated by means of a<br>
heating mantle. The examples where 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
2-ethylhexyl ester was obtained in 95% or greater purity are detailed below.<br>
[000152] Single step method using 2.6-di-tert-butvlphenol and 2-ethvlhexvl acrvlate<br>
("2-EHA").<br>
[000153] Into a 2-liter round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar and<br>
connected to Dean-Stark trap under nitrogen atmosphere, the following were<br>
charged:<br>
412.8 g2,6-DTBP-(2.00mol)<br>
50 g toluene<br>
2.20 g KOH pellets (39.2 mmol, 1.96 mol%)<br>
9.3 g (~8 ml) DMSO promoter (119 mmol, 5.9 mol%)<br>
[000154] The colorless slurry was heated to 150°C to remove the water/toluene<br>
azeotrope. A white slurry was obtained and 11.9 g of hazy toluene was collected in<br>
the trap. The Dean-Stark trap was removed and a cooling condenser was<br>
connected to the reactor and the reaction temperature was reset to 140dC. The 2-<br>
ethylhexylacrylate (2-EHA, 402 g, 2.18 rnol) was then added over 30 minutes. The<br>
resulting mixture was heated for a total of 6 hours at 140°C, during which time the<br>
temperature initially rose to 149°C before subsiding back to 140°C. GC analysis of<br>
the clear red orange reaction mixture showed &gt;98% 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol converted<br>
to product(s).<br>
 [000155] Neutralization and solvent removal.<br>
[000156] The resulting red orange reaction solution (containing the catalyst residue)<br>
was neutralized at 100°C by addition of 20 g of 17.0 wt. % (34.7 mmol acid, -88% of<br>
theoretical KOH catalyst) phosphoric acid. The acid solution was prepared by mixing<br>
4.0 g of 85% phosphoric acid and 16.0 g water. Mixing continued and the reaction<br>
mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The excess toluene and<br>
water were then removed under reduced pressure between room temperature and<br>
150 °C (down to 1.2 torr). The resulting oil was filtered while hot (140°C) over a<br>
celite bed (5 g) to remove potassium salts. A clear light yellow product (Gardner<br>
color 4.7) was obtained in near quantitative yield.<br>

[000158] This example demonstrates a two-step method for the production of 3,5-ditert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester, which is suitable for use<br>
as an antioxidant.<br>
[000159] Step 1: Preparation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
methyl ester.<br>
[000160] Into a 1-liter round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar and<br>
connected to a Dean-Stark trap and cooling condenser under N2 atmosphere, the<br>
following were charged:<br>
206.3 g 2,6-DTBP (1.00 mol)<br>
31.6 g toluene<br>
1.33 g KOH pellets (23.7 mmol, 2.37 mol%)<br>
4.71 g (~4 ml) DMSO promoter (60 mmol, 6.0 mol%)<br>
[000161] The reaction was heated to 140°C to remove the water/toluene azeotrope.<br>
A white slurry was obtained and 7.2 g hazy toluene was collected in the trap. The<br>
Dean-Stark trap was removed and a cooling condenser was connected to the<br>
reactor. The heating was reset to 120°C. Vigorous condensation was observed and<br>
99.1 g (1.15 mol) of methyl acrylate was added over a 45-minute period. After three<br>
hours of heating at 120°C, the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol conversion was about 98.5 %<br>
complete.<br>
 [000162] Step 2: Transesterification of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic<br>
acid, methyl ester and conversion to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
2-ethylhexyl ester.<br>
[000163] The excess MA was not removed. Heating was. reset to 155 °C for the<br>
transesterification and MeOH removal step. 2-Ethylhexanol (155.2 g, 1.19 mol) was<br>
charged and the reaction was heated for 4 hours with vigorous condensation while<br>
continuously purging with gentle nitrogen stream.<br>
[000164] Neutralization and solvent removal.<br>
[000165] The resulting reaction mixture was neutralized at 140°C by addition of 10.0<br>
g of 17 wt% (17 mmol, -73% of theoretical KOH catalyst) phosphoric acid. The acid<br>
solution was prepared by mixing 2.0 g of 85% phosphoric acid and 8.0 g water. After<br>
mixing for 1 hour, the red solution turned yellow. The excess toluene and water<br>
were then removed under gradually reduced pressure at a temperature between 40 °C and 150 °C (down to ~1 torr). The resulting oil was filtered at about 140 °C over a<br>
celite bed (5 g) to obtain 380 g (97.4% recovery) of yellow oil.<br>
[000166] (GC Analysis: 95.55 wt. % 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
[000167] This example demonstrates a two-step method for the production of 3,5-ditert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester using tetrahydrofuran as a<br>
promoter.<br>
[000168] Step 1: Preparation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
methyl ester.<br>
[000169] A 1-liter round bottom Pyrex flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar,<br>
thermal probe, heating mantle, water-cooled total reflux condenser, and 250-ml<br>
addition funnel were used. The flask was initially charged with 309.3 g of molten 2,6-<br>
DTBP (1.50 mol) at 40-50°C, 4.21 g of potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), and 16.82<br>
g of tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form a slurry. The slurry was heated to 110°C and<br>
142.0 g of methyl acrylate was added dropwise from the addition funnel over 98<br>
minutes while the reactor was maintained at 110-120°C. After holding at 120°C for<br>
3.6 additional hours, the red clear reaction mass was found (by GC) to contain 0.46<br>
area% 2,6-DTBP and 98.5 area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
methyl ester. The pressure was then reduced to 20 mm Hg to strip off the THF and<br>
excess methyl acrylate. The methyl ester intermediate contained 96.3 wt. % 3,5-ditert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, 0.11 wt. % 2,6-DTBP, 0.04<br>
wt% methyl acrylate, and 0.38 wt. % THF.<br>
[000170] Step 2: Transesterification of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic<br>
acid, methyl ester and conversion to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
isooctyl ester.<br>
[000171] A Vigreux column equipped with a water-cooled air-cooled partial<br>
condenser and a -15°C glycol-cooled total condenser was installed to the reactor.<br>
The above methyl ester intermediate was added with 200.4 g of Exxal-8® isooctanol<br>
(1.539 mol). The mixture was heated slowly from 43°C to 155°C at reduced<br>
pressure of 300 down to 50 mm Hg over 82 minutes. Approximately 55 ml of<br>
methanol distillate was collected. Then 6 ml of toluene was added dropwise over 50<br>
minutes to the reactor, which was kept at 155°C and 25-50 mm Hg. The toluene<br>
was used as a chaser to strip off the methanol byproduct from the reaction mass to<br>
drive the reaction to completion. At the end of the toluene feed, the reaction mass<br>
was found (by GC) containing 1.8 area% isooctanol, 0.19 area% 2,6-DTBP, 4.89<br>
area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, and 92.3 area%<br>
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester, indicating incompletion<br>
of the reaction of methyl ester to isooctyl ester. An additional 11.1 g of Exxal-8®<br>
isooctanol (0.085 mol) was charged to the reactor. Then 17 ml of toluene was added<br>
dropwise over 83 minutes, while keeping the reactor at 155°C and 30 mm Hg. The<br>
resulting product was analyzed by GC and found to contain 1.65 area% isooctanol,<br>
0.15 area% 2,6-DTBP, 1.12 area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid,<br>
methyl ester, and 96.6 area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl<br>
ester.<br>
[000172] After removing the column and the air-cooled partial condenser, an<br>
additional 25 ml of toluene was added as a chaser to strip off the excess isooctanol<br>
at 20 mm Hg and 150-155°C. The resulting product was found (by GC) to contain<br>
1.3 area% isooctanol, 0.2 area% 2,6-DTBP, 1.08 area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, methyl ester, and 97.1 area% 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester<br>
 [000173] Neutralization and solvent removal.<br>
[000174] The resulting product was then added to 2.25 g of acetic acid the product<br>
was at a temperature of 102-110°C in order to neutralize the potassium catalyst.<br>
The mixture turned to yellow and became cloudy. After adding 10.3 g of water, the<br>
mixture was then heated to 123°C and the pressure was reduced to 20 mm Hg to<br>
strip off the water, THF, and unreacted acetic acid. The resulting mixture was hazy, -<br>
but solid precipitations were not observed, indicating that the potassium acetate was<br>
not precipitated out as easily as the potassium phosphate salts.<br>
[000175] Additional acetic acid (1.55 g) was added and then the product was<br>
washed twice with water (182 g and 177 g) at 80-96°C. A clear interface was noted<br>
after approximately 7 to 9 minutes, although the organic product layer was cloudy.<br>
The aqueous layers were discarded. The organic layer was further dried by vacuum<br>
stripping the mixture at 20 mm Hg and at 120°C. The 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, isooctyl ester product weighed 587 grams.<br>
