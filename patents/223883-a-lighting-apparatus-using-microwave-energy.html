				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to lighting apparatus using microwave<br>
energy, and particularly, to a lighting apparatus using microwave energy<br>
capable of improving lighting efficiency.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br>
In general, lighting apparatus using microwave energy is a lighting<br>
system in which microwave energy generated from a magnetron is transmitted<br>
to a resonator through a waveguide, and a fill within a bulb disposed in the<br>
resonator emits visible light when excited by the microwave energy. The lighting<br>
apparatus using microwave energy has longer life span compare to an<br>
incandescent lamp or a fluorescent lamp and has excellent efficiency in lighting.<br>
As shown in FIG.1, a lighting apparatus using microwave energy<br>
comprises a casing 10 having an opening 12 through which microwave energy<br>
passes at its one side and a flange 14 outwardly extended from a circumference<br>
of the opening 12; a high voltage generator 20 installed inside the casing 10,<br>
and for generating and supplying high voltage; a magnetron 30 disposed inside<br>
the casing 10, electrically connected with the high voltage generator 20 to<br>
generate microwave energy by high voltage; a waveguide 40 fixed to a front<br>
surface of the casing 10, and for guiding microwave energy generated from the<br>
magnetron 30 toward the opening 12 of the casing 10 ; a resonator 50 fixed to<br>
the flange 14 of the casing 10, communicated with the waveguide 40, and having<br>
a resonant region therein where microwave energy is resonated ; a bulb 60<br>
rotatably mounted inside the resonator 50, and containing a fill which emits light<br>
when excited by microwave energy; a reflector 80 fixed to an outer surface of the<br>
casing 10, for forwardly reflecting light emitted from the bulb 60; a fan housing<br>
110 installed inside the casing 10, having an airflow path therein through which<br>
an external air is sucked, for cooling heat generated from the high voltage<br>
generator 20 and the magnetron 30 ; a cooling fan 100 provided within the fan<br>
housing 110, for sucking external air; a fan motor 101 for rotating the cooling fan<br>
100 ; a bulb motor 90 for rotating the bulb 60, of which a rotational shaft 92 is<br>
connected to a bulb stem 62 extended from the bulb 60 ; and a disk shaped rear<br>
mirror 70 fixed to the flange 14, having a hole 72 at a center thereof in which the<br>
bulb stem 62 is inserted.<br>
In the light apparatus according to the conventional art as above, high<br>
voltage is generated at the high voltage generator 20 when an external power is<br>
applied to the high voltage generator 20, and microwave energy is generated at<br>
the magnetron 30 by the high voltage. And, the microwave energy is transmitted<br>
to the resonator 50 through the waveguide 40, and excites the fill such as herein<br>
described within the bulb 60. Accordingly, the fill within the bulb 60 emits light,<br>
and the reflector 80 reflects the light emitted around the bulb 60. Also, the rear<br>
mirror 70 forwardly reflects the light emitted rearwardly from the bulb 60.<br>
At the same time, the cooling fan 100 is rotated by an operation of the<br>
fan motor 101, and thus external air out of the casing 10 is sucked into the<br>
casing 10 through the airflow path formed inside the fan housing 110. By the<br>
airflow inside the casing 10, the high voltage generator, the magnetron 30 and<br>
the other internal components are cooled. In addition, the bulb 60 is rotated for<br>
being cooled by an operation of the bulb motor 90.<br>
In the lighting apparatus using microwave energy according to the<br>
conventional art as above, one of important factors that have an effect on<br>
lighting performance is an effective reflection of light emitted from the bulb 60.<br>
Accordingly, the reflector 80 is installed around the bulb 60, and the rear mirror<br>
70 is installed at a rear side of the bulb 60, so that the reflector 80 and the rear<br>
mirror 70 forwardly reflect light that is emitted around the bulb and to a rear side<br>
of the bulb.<br>
However, since the rear mirror 70 provided for the lighting apparatus<br>
according to the conventional art is formed in a flat disk shape, the rear mirror<br>
70 cannot effectively reflect light emitted toward the rear of the bulb 60.<br>
Moreover, since the hole 72 is formed in the center of the rear mirror 70<br>
so that the bulb stem 62 is rotatably inserted thereto, even if the hole 72 is<br>
formed to have a minimum diameter in which the bulb stem 62 can be rotated in<br>
order to reflect the light emitted to the rear of the bulb 60 as much as possible,<br>
the light emitted from the bulb 60 is not fully reflected because of the hole 72.<br>
Further, the light which is not reflected because of the hole 72 may pass<br>
through the hole 72 and may be transmitted to a rear of the mirror 70, or may be<br>
scattered by the hole 72, thereby causing degradation in light reflection<br>
efficiency.<br>
In addition, heat generated from the bulb 60 is transmitted to the bulb<br>
stem 62, and thus a thermal damage such that a coated layer is peeled away at<br>
a portion adjacent to the bulb stem 62 may be generated. Therefore,<br>
components have to be replaced because of such a thermal damage of the rear<br>
mirror 70, thereby raising high material and operation costs. In order to prevent<br>
the thermal damage, the rear mirror 70 is made of a high priced heat resistible<br>
material such as quartz, thereby raising an initial installation cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a lighting<br>
apparatus using microwave energy capable of improving reflection efficiency of<br>
light rearwardly emitted from the bulb, and also reducing material cost of the<br>
mirror.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein,<br>
there is provided a lighting apparatus using microwave energy, comprising a<br>
magnetron disposed inside a casing, for generating microwave energy ; a<br>
waveguide for guiding microwave energy; a resonator providing a resonant<br>
region in which the microwave energy is resonated ; a bulb disposed inside the<br>
resonator, and filled with a material such as herein described which emits light,<br>
when excited by the microwave energy ; and a rear mirror such as herein<br>
described integrally fixed to a rear of the bulb, for forwardly reflecting light<br>
rearwardly emitted from the bulb.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Hereinafter, a light apparatus using microwave energy according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG.<br>
2.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a light apparatus using microwave energy according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention comprises a casing 10 having an<br>
opening 12 through which microwave passes, and a flange 14 outwardly<br>
extended from a circumference of the opening 12 ; a high voltage generator 20<br>
installed inside the casing 10, for generating and supplying high voltage ; a<br>
magnetron 30 disposed inside the casing 10, electrically connected with the high<br>
voltage generator 20 to generate microwave energy by high voltage ; a<br>
waveguide 40 fixed to a front of the casing 10, for guiding microwave energy<br>
generated from the magnetron 30 toward the opening 12 of the casing 10; a<br>
resonator 50 fixed to the flange 14 of the casing 10, communicated with the<br>
waveguide 40, and having a resonant region therein where microwave energy is<br>
resonated; a bulb 60 rotatably mounted inside the resonator 50, and containing a<br>
fill such as herein described which emits light when excited by microwave energy<br>
a reflector 80 fixed to an outer surface of the casing 10, for forwardly reflecting<br>
light emitted from the bulb 60; and a rear mirror 75 integrally coupled to the bulb<br>
60 at a rear side of the bulb 60, for forwardly reflecting light rearwardly emitted<br>
from the bulb 60.<br>
In addition, the lighting apparatus further comprises a fan housing 110<br>
installed inside the casing 10, having an airflow path therein through which an<br>
external air is sucked, for cooling heat generated from the high voltage generator<br>
20 and the magnetron 30; a cooling fan 100 provided inside the fan housing<br>
110, for sucking external air; a fan motor 101 for rotating the cooling fan 100;<br>
and a bulb motor 90 for rotating the bulb 60 so as to cool heat generated from<br>
the bulb 60.<br>
The resonator 50 is formed in a cylindrical shape of which one side is<br>
closed so as to prevent a leakage of microwave, and also formed in a mesh so<br>
that light emitted from the bulb 60 can pass therethrough.<br>
The bulb 60 consists of a bulb portion 64 positioned outside the opening<br>
12, formed in a spherical shape, and having a filling space therein ; and a bulb<br>
stem 62 extended from one side of the bulb portion 64, and formed in a rod<br>
shape with a certain length. The bulb stem 62 penetrates the waveguide 40, and<br>
is connected with a rotational shaft 92 of the bulb motor 90. Accordingly, in case<br>
that the rotational shaft 92 is rotated by the operation of the bulb motor 90, the<br>
bulb 60 is rotated by the rotation of the rotational shaft 92.<br>
The filling space of the bulb 60 is filled with several fills such as metal<br>
halide, sulfur (S), selenium (Se) or the like for leading light emitting. Also, an inert<br>
gas such as argon (Ar), xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr) or the like for forming a plasma<br>
at an initial light-emitting and an additional material for easily emitting by helping<br>
initial electric discharge and for controlling a spectrum of light are filled in the<br>
filling space of the bulb 60.<br>
The rear mirror 75 is integrally fixed to the bulb stem 62 in the vicinity of<br>
an outer circumference of the bulb portion 64 of the bulb 60. Preferably, a width<br>
of the rear mirror 75 and a distance between the rear mirror 75 and the outer<br>
circumference of the bulb are designed so that light emitted from the bulb 60 is<br>
not transmitted to a rear side of the rear mirror 75, but is fully reflected. That is<br>
preferably, the rear mirror 75 and the reflector 80 are designed so that the light<br>
which is not reflected by the rear mirror 75 is reflected by the reflector 80.<br>
In addition, preferably, the rear mirror 75 is formed in a hemispherical<br>
shape having a curved surface which is curved towards the bulb 60. At this time,<br>
a curvature of the curved surface of the rear mirror 75 is formed so that the<br>
center of the bulb 60 is positioned at a focal point of the curved surface, in order<br>
to have effective light-reflection efficiency.<br>
Hereinafter, operations of the light apparatus using microwave energy<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention will now be described.<br>
First, high voltage is generated when an external power is applied to the<br>
high voltage generator 20, and microwave energy is generated at the<br>
magnetron 30 by the high voltage. And, the microwave energy generated from<br>
the magnetron 30 is transmitted to the resonator 50 through the waveguide 40,<br>
and excites a fill within the bulb 60 disposed inside the resonator 50.<br>
Accordingly, the fill within the bulb 60 emits light when excited by microwave<br>
energy, the reflector 80 forwardly reflects light emitted around the bulb 60, and<br>
the rear mirror 75 being rotated together with the bulb 60 reflects light emitted to<br>
the rear of the bulb 60.<br>
At the same time, the cooling fan 100 is rotated by an operation of the<br>
fan motor 101 and thus introduces external air out of the casing 10 into the<br>
casing 10, thereby cooling the high voltage generator 20, the magnetron 30 and<br>
other internal components. In addition, the bulb 60, the bulb stem 62 and the<br>
rear mirror 75 are integrally rotated for being cooled by the operation of the bulb<br>
motor 90, to be cooled.<br>
In the apparatus using microwave energy according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention constructed and operated as described above, the rear<br>
mirror for forwardly reflecting light emitted to a rear side from the bulb is<br>
integrally fixed to the bulb, thus light emitted to a rear side from the bulb is<br>
optimally reflected toward a front side of the lighting apparatus, and lighting<br>
efficiency of the lighting apparatus can be improved.<br>
In addition, since the rear mirror is formed in a hemispherical shape<br>
having a curved surface which is curved toward the bulb, unidirectionality of<br>
light can be improved.<br>
Also, since the rear mirror is integrally fixed to the bulb stem in the<br>
vicinity of the bulb, a reflective area of the rear mirror can be reduced compared<br>
to the conventional art wherein the rear mirror is fixed to the casing at large<br>
distance from the bulb.<br>
In addition, since the rear mirror is integrally rotated with the bulb, heat<br>
transmitted to the rear mirror is easily cooled, and thermal damage such as<br>
peeling away of a coated layer of the rear mirror or the like can be prevented.<br>
Hereinafter, a lighting apparatus using microwave energy according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 3. Hereinafter, the same numerals will be given for the same parts as one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and description thereof will be omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a light apparatus using microwave energy according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention includes a rear mirror 175<br>
integrally coupled to a bulb stem 62 of the bulb 60, and integrally rotated with<br>
the bulb 60, for forwardly reflecting light which is emitted to a rear from the bulb<br>
60; and a fixed mirror 170 fixed to the inside of a flange 14 outwardly extended<br>
from a circumference of an opening 12 of the casing 10, and having a hole 172<br>
in a center of the rear mirror 175 so that the bulb stem 62 is rotatably inserted<br>
therein.<br>
Preferably, the rear mirror 175 is disposed in the vicinity of an outer<br>
circumferential surface of the bulb 60 so as to improve reflecting efficiency, and<br>
is formed in a hemispherical shape having a curved surface which is curved<br>
toward the bulb 60. Here, a curvature of the curved surface of the rear mirror<br>
175 is formed so that the center of the bulb 60 is positioned at a focal point of<br>
the curved surface of the rear mirror 175.<br>
Preferably, the fixed mirror 170 is formed in a hemispherical shape<br>
having a curved surface, which is curved toward the bulb 60 so as to improve<br>
light reflection efficiency. In addition, preferably, a curvature of the curved<br>
surface of the fixed mirror 170 is formed so that the center of the bulb 60 is<br>
positioned at a focal point of the curved surface of the fixed mirror 170.<br>
Preferably, a width of the hole 172 of the fixed mirror 170 is formed to be<br>
smaller than a width of the rear mirror 175 so that the light emitted from the bulb<br>
60 is not transmitted to a rear of the fixed mirror 170.<br>
An interval between an inner circumferential surface of the hole 172 of<br>
the fixed mirror 170 and an outer circumferential surface of the bulb stem 62<br>
can be widened as much as the width of the rear mirror 175, whereby the heat<br>
of the bulb 60, which is transmitted to the bulb stem 62 has a smaller effect on<br>
the hole 172 of the fixed mirror 170.<br>
Since the rear mirror 175 is installed adjacent to the bulb 60, the rear<br>
mirror 175 is made of a high priced heat resistible material such as quartz.<br>
However, since the fixed mirror 170 at a relatively large distance from the bulb<br>
60, and the heat has a small effect on the hole 172 of the fixed mirror 170, the<br>
fixed mirror 170 is made of a relatively low priced ceramic material such as<br>
AI2O3, Si3N4 or AIN material. According to this, material cost of the light<br>
apparatus can be reduced. In addition, since the fixed mirror 170 is additionally<br>
provided besides the rear mirror 175, a reflective area of the rear mirror 175 can<br>
be reduced more, and the material cost can be reduced more.<br>
By the construction as above, the light which is rearwardly emitted from<br>
the bulb 60 is forwardly reflected by the rear mirror 175 rotated with the bulb 60<br>
and the fixed mirror 170 fixed to the casing 10.<br>
In the light apparatus using microwave energy according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention constructed and operated as described<br>
above, since the rear mirror for forwardly reflecting light emitted toward a rear of<br>
the bulb is integrally fixed to the bulb, light rearwardly emitted from the bulb is<br>
optimally reflected, thus the lighting efficiency of the lighting apparatus can be<br>
improved.<br>
And, since the rear mirror is integrally fixed to the bulb stem in the<br>
vicinity of the bulb, a reflective area of the rear mirror is reduced, thus material<br>
cost is reduced.<br>
In addition, since the rear mirror is integrally rotated with the bulb, heat<br>
transmitted to the rear mirror is easily cooled, thereby preventing thermal<br>
damage such as peeling away of a coated layer of the rear mirror.<br>
In addition, since the fixed mirror fixed to the casing at a rear side of the<br>
rear mirror is additionally provided, a reflective area of the rear mirror which<br>
requires a high priced heat resistible material is reduced more, and thus the<br>
material cost is reduced more too.<br>
In addition, since the rear mirror and the fixed mirror are formed in a<br>
hemispherical shape having a curved shape which is curved toward the bulb,<br>
unidirectionality of light can be improved.<br>
As so far described, a lighting apparatus using microwave energy<br>
according to the present invention constructed as above can improve reflection<br>
efficiency of light which is emitted to the rear of the bulb, and also reduce<br>
material cost of the mirror.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather<br>
