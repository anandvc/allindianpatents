HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2008/055815<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/061677<br><br>
CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5  This invention relates to aqueous conditioning shampoo compositions comprising a cleansing surfactant and a gel network.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
10<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions comprising various combinations of cleansing surfactant and conditioning agents are known.  These products typically comprise an anionic cleansing surfactant in combination with a conditioning<br>
15  agent.  Amongst the most popular conditioning agents used in shampoo compositions are oily materials such as mineral oils, naturally occurring oils such as triglycerides and silicone polymers.  These are generally present in the shampoo as dispersed hydrophobic emulsion droplets.<br>
20  Conditioning is achieved by the oily material being<br>
deposited onto the hair resulting in the formation of a film.  Such compositions often have a relatively low viscosity and may be perceived to be low quality as a result.<br>
25<br>
Other conditioning shampoo compositions use gel networks comprising fatty alcohol to structure or thicken the product and also to deliver a conditioning benefit.  US 2003/0223952 (P&amp;G) discloses conditioning shampoos comprising detersive<br>
30  surfactant and a gel network made from fatty alcohol and a cationic surfactant.<br><br><br>
WO 2008/055815<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/061677<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
The use of particulate materials in conditioning shampoos is not common.  US 6,617,292 B2 (L'Oreal) discloses conditioning shampoos comprising aluminium oxide, an amphoteric or nonionic surfactant, a fatty acid or fatty 5  alcohol, and a cationic surfactant.<br>
A problem that arises with many of the conditioners disclosed in the prior art is that they do not give good sensory benefits both when the hair is wet, i.e., during 10  and/or immediately after application and also when the hair is subsequently dried.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
15  The present inventors have found that excellent sensory benefits may be given to both wet and subsequently dried hair by use of conditioning shampoos comprising an anionic cleansing surfactants and a particularly structured gel network.  These conditioning shampoos also have the benefit<br>
20  of having a rich, creamy appearance, enhancing their perception of being high quality products.<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions of the invention give good wet feel and ease of wet combing.  In addition they give 25  good dry feel, ease of dry combing, and manageability.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an aqueous conditioning shampoo composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant and a gel network comprising:<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compositions of the invention are suitable for application to the human hair.  They are typically used as 5  rinse off products, that is to say their application is usually followed by a rinsing stage with water.<br>
The invention uses a gel network as described hereinafter to deliver structure and conditioning benefits to a shampoo 10  composition comprising an anionic cleansing surfactant.  The term "structure", when used in this context, should be understood to mean "thicken", i.e. increase the viscosity thereof.<br>
15  The preferred viscosity for products according to the<br>
invention is from 3000 to 9000 cP (mPa.s), more preferably from 5000 to 7000 cP (mPa.s), and most preferably from 5500 to 6500 cP (mPa.s) at 30Â°C, as measured by a Brookfield viscometer equipped with a RVT pin number 5 at a measuring<br>
20  speed of 20 rpm.<br>
By "aqueous conditioning shampoo composition" is meant a composition which has water or an aqueous solution or a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase as its major component. 25  Typically, the composition will comprise at least 50%,<br>
preferably at least 60%, at most preferably at least 75% by weight of water.<br>

Anionic cleansing surfactant<br>
Conditioning shampoo compositions according to the invention comprise one or more anionic cleansing surfactants, which are 5  cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic cleansing surfactants are the alkyl sulphates, alkyl ether sulphates, alkaryl sulphonates,<br>
10  alkanoyl isethionates, alkyl succinates, alkyl<br>
sulphosuccinates, alkyl ether sulphosuccinates, N-alkyl sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl ether phosphates, and alkyl ether carboxylic acids and salts thereof, especially their sodium, magnesium, ammonium and mono-, di- and<br>
15  triethanolamine salts.  The alkyl and acyl groups generally contain from 8 to 18, preferably from 10 to 16 carbon atoms and may be unsaturated.  The alkyl ether sulphates, alkyl ether sulphosuccinates, alkyl ether phosphates and alkyl ether carboxylic acids and salts thereof may contain from 1<br>
20  to 20 ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units per molecule.<br>
Typical anionic cleansing surfactants for use in shampoo compositions of the invention include sodium oleyl succinate, ammonium lauryl sulphosuccinate, sodium lauryl sulphate,<br>
25  sodium lauryl ether sulphate, sodium lauryl ether<br>
sulphosuccinate, ammonium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl ether sulphate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, triethanolamine dodecylbenzene sulphonate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauryl isethionate, lauryl ether<br>
30  carboxylic acid and sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate.<br>

Preferred anionic cleansing surfactants are sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium lauryl ether sulphate(n)EO, (where n is from 1 to 3), sodium lauryl ether sulphosuccinate(n)EO, (where n is from 1 to 3), ammonium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl 5  ether sulphate (n)EO, (where n is from 1 to 3), sodium cocoyl isethionate and lauryl ether carboxylic acid (n) EO (where n is from 10 to 20).<br>
Mixtures of any of the foregoing anionic cleansing 10  surfactants may also be suitable.<br>
The total amount of anionic cleansing surfactant preferably ranges from 0.5 to 45%, more preferably from 1 to 30%, and most preferably from 5 to 20% by total weight of the 15  composition.<br>
Gel Network<br>
The gel network is formed by combining the components at a 20  temperature above the melting point of the fatty material in the presence of water.  In a preferred method of manufacture in accordance with the fourth aspect of the invention, the fatty material is melted in water and the particulate material is then added.  In a more preferred method of 25  manufacture, a quaternary ammonium compound is also added, preferably after the particulate material.  A dispersion of liquid crystalline phase droplets is typically produced.  It will be realised- that, in effect, the gel network has another component: water.  In preferred embodiments, the gel<br>
30  network comprises an LB lamellar phase dispersion at 25Â°C.<br>

The composition according to the invention can only be formed with a separately made gel network. Mixing the components of the gel network together without premixing and heating does not form a gel network. 5<br>
Fatty material<br>
A fatty material selected.from fatty alcohol, fatty acid, fatty amide, or mixtures thereof is an  essential component 0  of the gel network.  Preferably, the fatty material<br>
comprises a C12-C22 fatty alcohol.  The fatty alcohol is<br>
preferably a primary alcohol.  The fatty alcohol and/or fatty acid and/or fatty amide preferably has a linear (i.e.<br>
non-branched) C12-C22 hydrocarbon chain.  Preferably, said 5  chain is saturated.  Preferably, the fatty alcohol and/or fatty acid is C16-C22  and more preferably it is C16-C18-Most preferably the fatty material is cetyl alcohol and/or stearyl alcohol.<br>
0  The total amount of fatty material selected from C3.2-C22<br>
fatty alcohol, C12-C22 fatty acid, or mixtures thereof, is<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 20%, more preferably from 0.1 to 10%, and most preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight of the total composition.  In preferred embodiments, these<br>
5  preferred amounts apply to the level of C12-C22 fatty alcohol<br>
in the total composition.<br>

Particles having platelet morphology<br>
Particles having platelet morphology are a second essential component of the gel network.  Without wishing to be bound 5  by theory, it is believed that such particles act as<br>
templates that help sustain the ordered structure of the gel network within the shampoo composition, despite the presence of anionic surfactant therein.  The particles are believed to enhance the stability and performance of the gel network 10  as a result.<br>
The particles should be understood to be solid and to have a melting point greater than that of the fatty material. When the gel network also comprises a quaternary ammonium<br>
15  compound (vide  infra),   the particles also have a melting point higher than this component.  Typically, the solid particles have an inorganic core, although they may be surface-modified with organic groups (vide infra). Preferably, the particles have a melting point of greater<br>
20  than 150Â°C.<br>
^Platelet morphology" should be understood to mean that the particles have a plate-like" shape, i.e. their lengths in two orthogonal directions are considerably greater than<br>
25  their length in the third orthogonal direction.  Typically, the particles have length and breadth that are each independently at least 10 times greater their depth; where "length", "breadth", and "depth" are expressions for the three orthogonal directions.<br>
