THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYCARBONATE"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention concerns compositions containing polycarbonate and esters of a linear carboxylic acid and a branched alcohol, together with products manufactured from these compositions.<br>
Compositions containing polycarbonates are commonly. used plastics. They are. utilised in many different areas. A wide variety of products, including sheets, are produced from the compositions by means of conventional processing methods, such as injection moulding or extrusion.<br>
In addition to polycarbonate,. the compositions conventionally contain other components that improve the properties of the composition. Examples of these include lubricants. Carboxylic acid esters, for example, are used as lubricants.<br>
Compositions containing polycarbonate and Guerbet alcohols are known. Guerbet alcohols are the products of the Guerbet reaction.<br>
Polycarbonate sheets are known for example from EP-A 0 110 221 and are produced for a variety of applications. Polycarbonate sheets are manufactured for example by extrusion of compositions containing polycarbonate.<br>
Coextrusion with compositions that contain polycarbonate and that additionally contain UV absorbers is possible.<br>
One problem that arises during extrusion of such sheets is the deposition of volatile components from the moulding composition on the calibrator (in the case of multi-wall sheets) or on the rolls (in the case of solid sheets), which can lead to surface defects on the sheets. Examples of volatile components include UV absorbers, mould release agents and other low-molecular components of the compositions.<br><br><br>
EP-A 0 320 632 describes coextruded sheets consisting of compositions that contain polycarbonate, contain a UV absorber and can contain a lubricant. Disadvantageously, with extended extrusion of the composition according to EP-A 0 320 632 to form sheets, the surface of the sheets is adversely influenced by evaporations from the melt of compositions. During coextrusion the increased evaporation of the UV absorber from the melt of compositions leads to the formation of deposits on the calibrator or on the rolls and ultimately to the formation of defects on the surface of the sheets (e.g. white spots, waviness, etc.). On the calibrator, polycarbonate abrasion can also lead to powdery deposits on the coextruded polycarbonate sheets.<br>
Compositions consisting of esters of Guerbet alcohols and polycarbonates are also known. EP-A 0 390 994, for example, describes compositions containing special fatty acid esters of Guerbet alcohols as mould release agents.<br>
EP-A 0 649 724 describes a process for the production of multi-layer sheets from branched polycarbonates with average molecular weights M w of 27,000 g/mol to 29,500 g/mol by coextrusion of a core layer and at least one outer layer with 1 to 15 wt.% of a UV absorber. If the mould release agents glycerol monostearate, pentaerythritol tetrastearate or mixtures thereof as described in EP-A 0 300 485 are used in the compositions for production of these plastic sheets, the surface of the sheets nevertheless deteriorates over time.<br>
It is known from WO 99/05205 that mixtures of mould release agents, consisting of fatty acid esters of pentaerythritol and glycerol for example, can be used to minimise the formation of deposits on the calibrator or on the rolls, which leads to the formation of defects on the surface of the sheets (e.g. white spots, waviness, etc.).<br>

Preferred antistatics are non-ionogenic compounds.<br><br><br>
All feedstocks and solvents used for synthesis of the coextrusion compositions according to the invention can be contaminated with corresponding impurities as a result of manufacture and storage conditions, the objective being to work with the cleanest possible starting materials.<br>
The individual components can be mixed by known means, both successively and simultaneously, and at both room temperature and elevated temperature.<br>
The additives are preferably incorporated into the compositions according to the invention by known means by mixing polymer granules with the additives at temperatures from around 200 to 400°C in conventional units such as internal mixers, single-screw extruders and double-shaft extruders, for example by melt compounding or melt extrusion or by mixing the polymer solutions with solutions of the additives, followed by evaporation of the solvents by known means. The proportion of additives in the moulding composition can be varied between broad limits and is governed by the desired properties of the compositions. The total proportion of additives in the compositions is preferably up to around 20 wt.%, by preference 0.2 to 12 wt.%, relative to the weight of the composition.<br>
As is underlined by the examples according to the invention, the use of the compositions according to the invention on any polycarbonate moulding compositions as base material offers a significant advantage. The base material for the sheet can also be treated with the mould release agent from the composition according to the invention.<br>
The invention therefore also provides mouldings produced using the compositions according to the invention. The compositions can be used to produce solid plastic sheets and multi-wall sheets (e.g. twin-wall sheets). The sheets therefore also include those that display on one or both sides an additional outer layer with the compositions according to the invention having an elevated content of UV absorbers.<br><br><br>
The compositions according to the invention simplify the manufacture of products, particularly of sheets and products produced therefrom, such as glazing for greenhouses, conservatories, bus shelters, advertising hoardings, signs, protective screens, automotive glazing, windows and roofs.<br>
Subsequent processing steps for products coated with the compositions according to the invention, e.g. thermoforming or surface treatments, e.g. application of scratch-resistant coatings, water-spreading layers and similar are possible and the present invention likewise provides the products manufactured by these methods.<br>
Coextrusion is known per se from the literature (see for example EP-A 0 110 221 andEP-A0 110 238).<br>
In the present case the procedure is preferably performed as follows:<br>
Extruders are connected to a coextrusion adapter to produce the core and outer layer(s). The adapter is designed in such a way that the melts forming the outer layer(s) are applied adhesively as a thin layer to the melt of the core.<br>
The multi-layer melt strand produced in this way is then transferred to the adjacent die in the desired form (multi-wall sheet or solid sheet). The melt is then cooled under controlled conditions by known means by calendering (solid sheet) or vacuum calibration (multi-wall sheet) and then cut into lengths. A conditioning oven can optionally be connected after the calibration stage to eliminate stresses. In place of the adapter connected before the die, the die itself can also be designed in such a way that the melts are brought together there.<br><br><br>
The invention is illustrated by means of the following example.<br>
Example<br>
10 mm twin-wall sheets A to F, such as are described for example in EP-A 0 110 238, were obtained from the following compositions: Makrolon® KU 1-1243 (branched bisphenol A polycarbonate from Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, with a melt flow rate (MFR) of 6.5 g/10 min at 300°C and 1.2 kg load) was used as base material. This was coextruded with the compounds listed in the table and based on Makrolon® 3100 (linear bisphenol A polycarbonate from Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, with a melt flow rate (MFR) of 6.5 g/10 min at 300°C and 1.2 kg load).<br>
The thickness of the coext0.<br>
3rusion layer was around 50 μm in each case.<br><br>

The machines and equipment used to produce multi-layer multi-wall sheets are described below.<br>
The apparatus consisted of<br>
-	the main extruder with a screw of length 33 D and a diameter of 70 mm with venting<br>
-	the coex adapter (feedblock system)<br>
-	a coextruder for applying the outer layer with a screw of length 25 D and a diameter of 30 mm<br>
-	the special sheet extrusion die with a width of 350 mm<br>
-	the calibrator<br>
-	the roller conveyor<br>
-	the take-off unit<br>
-	the flying knife (saw)<br>
-	the stacking table.<br>
The polycarbonate granules forming the base material were supplied to the feed hopper for the main extruder, the UV coextrusion material to that for the coextruder. In each case the material is melted and conveyed in the corresponding cylinder/screw plasticising system. Both material melts were brought together in the coex adapter and formed a composite after leaving the die and being cooled in the calibrator. The other equipment served to transport, cut to length and stack the extruded sheets.<br><br><br>
Coextrusion with D (reference):<br>
-	first minor deposits after 4 hours<br>
-	slight transverse waves appearing after 90 minutes at irregular intervals, which have a slightly negative influence on the sheet quality.<br>
Somewhat stronger transverse waves after 4 1/2 hours.<br>
-	rating: good<br>
Coextrusion with E (reference):<br>
-	first minor defects after 50 minutes (transverse waves, small white blisters)<br>
-	more significant defects after 90 minutes (warping of cross-pieces, white deposits, transverse waves)<br>
-	rating: poor<br>
Coextrusion with F (reference):<br>
-	first minor defects after 90 minutes (small white blisters)<br>
-	more significant defects after 100 minutes (warping of cross-pieces, white deposits)<br>
-	rating: satisfactory to poor<br>
Coextrusion with A:<br>
-	no deposits over a test period of 5 hours<br>
-	slight transverse waves appearing after 90 minutes at irregular intervals, which have a slightly negative influence on the sheet quality<br>
-	rating: very good<br>
Coextrusion with B:<br>
-	no deposits over a test period of 5 hours<br>
-	slight transverse waves appearing after 90 minutes at irregular intervals, which have a slightly negative influence on the sheet quality<br>
-	rating: very good<br><br><br>
