(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING PACLITAXEL"<br>
CIPLA LIMITED, an Indian company of 289 Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai - 400 008, India;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing paclitaxel.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Paclitaxel is a known antineoplastic compound which, if desired, can be isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia (Western Yew). Its chemical name is 5p,20-epoxy-l,2a,4,7p,10p,13a-hexahydroxytax-ll-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2R,3S)-N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine. The chemical structure is shown below.<br><br>
PACLITAXEL<br>
Synthetic and semi-synthetic methods of producing the compound are, however, known. One such method is described in US 5229526 and continuation-in-part US 5274124 to Holton. As with many syntheses, Ihese patents describe a process for obtaining paclitaxel from the compound 10-deacetyi baccatht The initial steps used are those according to Green et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1988, 110, 5917-5919) in which 10-deacetyl baccatin is first sflylated and then acerylated according to the following scheme:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The yield of the silylated product is reported (in the above patents) to be 84-86% after purification, and the yield of the acetylated product is reported to be 86%. The acetylated product is then converted to paclitaxel via a stereospecific coupling reaction with an appropriate P-lactam followed by deprotection.<br>
Whilst the above-mentioned process is in some respects satisfactory, we have now devised an improved process wherein the yield of intermediate compounds is much greater such that purification of the intermediates is not required. Statement of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a process for preparing paclitaxel, which process comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	acetylating 10-deacetyl baccatin III at C-10 to give baccatin-III in the presence; of a tertiary amine base;<br>
b)	protecting baccatin-III at the C-7 position by reacting baccatin-III with a protecting group which is carried out at less than 25° C;<br>
c)	converting the product of step (b) to paclitaxel in a manner as herein described and deprotecting in the presence of zinc and a weak acid to obtain paclitaxel; Detailed Description<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing paclitaxel, which process comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	acetylating 10-deacetyl baccatin III at C-10 to give baccatin-III in the presence of a tertiary amine base;<br>
b)	protecting baccatin-III at the C-7 position by reacting baccatin-III with a protecting group which is carried out at less than 25° C;<br>
c)	converting the product of step (b) to paclitaxel in a manner as herein described and deprotecting in the presence of zinc and a weak acid to obtain paclitaxel.<br>
According to a highly preferred aspect of the invention, in step (b) we prefer to use (Troc) as the protecting group.<br>
Thus, contrary to previous methods, the process of the invention proceeds first by acetylation of 10-deacetyl baccatin III at the C-10 position followed by protection at the C-7 position. We have found that, surprisingly, by carrying out the process in the above manner much greater chemoselectivity is achieved. The result of this is that both baccatin III and the C-7 protected baccatin III derivative are obtained in much greater yield than the intermediates obtained in previous processes. With our process, we have found that the yield of baccatin III is basically quantitative-that is 100% yield, or very close to 100% yield. The C-7 protected baccatin III derivative is also obtained in quantitative, or virtually quantitative yields (that is, 100% yield). For example, when using Troc as the protecting group, we obtain a yield of 7-Troc-baccatin III of from 97 and 100%, depending upon the exact conditions. By contrast, we have found that by employing C-7 protection first using chloride followed by acetylation at the C-10 position (as in the above US patents), the intermediate 7- triethylsilyl- 10-deacetyl baccatin III is obtained with 74% yield, and the intermediate 7-triethylsilyl baccatin III is obtained with 78.5% yield. Conversely, the high yields of intermediates obtained by our process means that no additional purification steps, as are conventionally needed, are required although they can of course be employed if desired.    In<br><br><br><br>
conventional methods, purification of the intermediates leads to an overall loss in yields, so by dispensing with this requirement the present process is more economical and efficient.<br>
We have found that the use of a tertiary amine base in step (a) of the process surprisingly speeds up the reaction time of this step to about 1 hour or less and provides a very pure product in virtually quantitative yield. Holton et al (Tetrahedron letters 39 (1998) 2883-2886) have reported on the selective protection of the C(7) and C(10) hydroxyl groups in 10-deacetyl baccatin HL For production of baccatin m, the maximum reported yield is 95% (using CeCl3 and acetic anhydride) which is less than that achieved in the present invention. Furthermore, addition of base is reported by Holton et al to induce the formation of 7-aceryl-10-DAB and 7-acetyl baccatin HI side products. In contrast, we have found that the use of a tertiary amine base can, in feet, surprisingly give excellent results in terms of reaction time, yield and product purity. Indeed, we have found that repetition of the pertinent Examples from Holton et al gives high impurity levels, thus necessitating further purifications. In the present process, any suitable tertiary amine base can be used, for example any member of the trialkylamines (including isomers thereof), for example trialkylamines where each alkyl group is, independently, C1 to C10. Particularly good results have been achieved using triethylamine, so we prefer to use this compound, although similar compounds can be used. The completion of the reaction within 1 hour or less contributes to an efficient and economical process, and provides considerable advantage for a commercial scale operation.<br>
The acetylation in step (a) can be accomplished using any suitable method. For example, it can be done using acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. Acetic anhydride can, for example, be used in the presence of CeCI3 or ZnCI2 or YbCl3 employing an organic solvent system, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
Any suitable protecting group can be used in step (b), although we prefer to use 2,2,2-trichloroethylchloroformate (Troc). We have found that Troc protection can be employed advantageously in the present process because only mild conditions are required for deprotection. Harsh or strongly acidic conditions, which may affect other parts of the taxane molecule, are therefore avoided. In previous processes, the protecting groups used have required strongly acidic conditions for deprotection, and this results in a crude product with more impurities. In these circumstances, the product is difficult to purify and thus obtained in low yield. Use of Troc in particular avoids these difficulties and thus contributes to higher<br><br><br>
overall yields of product. Other suitable protecting groups include carbobenzyloxycarbonyl, or t-butoxycarbonyl or 9-flurenylmethoxycarbonyl.<br>
Use of Troc gives the intermediate 7-Troc-baccatin-III (compound III). Advantageously, a catalyst is used to perform step (b). Any suitable catalyst may be used, although we prefer to use a 4-dimelhylammopyridine (DMAP). Other suitable tertiary amines such as triethyl amine, di-isopropyl ethyl amine, N,N-dimethyl aniline can be employed if desired The use of a catalyst during step (b) helps ensure virtually quantitative yields of product with respect to baccatin-III.<br>
In a highly preferred aspect of the invention, step (b) is performed at less than room temperature (that is, less than about 25°C), preferably at less than 0°C. It is particularly preferred to use a low temperature of, for example, from -5°C to -15°C, suitably from -5°C to -10°C. We have found that the use of a low temperature during this step gives a fewer impurities than when the reaction is done at room temperature, and also reduces the reaction time. Low temperature conditions are particularly suitable when employing Troc as the protecting group.<br>
It is also preferred during step (b) to add the protecting group in two or more lots during the reactioa This helps improve both the yield and purity of the product and, importantly, also reduces the reaction time for this step. Typically, the reaction time is reduced to about 1 hour for addition of two separate lots of protecting group. Addition of the protecting group in two or more lots is particularly preferred when Troc is used, as this gives very good results. For example, addition of Troc in two lots to baccatin EI so as to give 7-Troc- baccatin IDt, using DMAP as catalyst and a temperature of from -5°C to -15°C, gives a quantitative yield of 7-Troc-baccatin HI (that is, 100% yield), negligible impurities and a reaction time of 1 hour. Similar results are obtained using suitable catalysts other than DMAP.<br>
The starting material, 10-deacetyl baccatin III can be obtained according to known procedures. For example, it can, if desired, be obtained from the needles of Taxus baccata.<br>
Step (c) involves converting the product of step (b), which is preferably 7-Troc-baccatin in, to paclitaxel, and this can be achieved by any suitable method. One such method is that described in US 5229526 and US 5274124. Typically, step (c) involves coupling the product of step (b) with a suitable compound so as to give a Pamido ester side chain at the C-13 position, followed by deprotection at the C-7 position.  We prefer to use a suitable P-<br><br>
lactam such as, for example, N-benzoyl-3-triethylsiyloxy-4-phenyl azetidin-2-one in the coupling reaction.<br>
A preferred process scheme is as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The coupling reaction in step (c) is preferably carried out using 7-Trocbaccatin-III and a racemic mixture of N-benzoyl-3-triethylsilyIoxy-4-phenyl azetidine-2-one in the presence of n-butyl lithium. This is an efficient reaction and gives good stereoselectivity. However, other methods of coupling a suitable p-amido ester side chain to the C-7 and C-10 protected baccatin-IIl intermediate, as will be clear to those skilled in the art, can be used if desired.<br>
Normally, a deprotection step is required following the coupling reaction. Any suitable method of deprotection may be used, although we prefer to avoid using harsh or strongly acidic conditions. Where 7-Troc deprotection is required, the deprotection can, for example, be carried out using zinc and acetic acid. It will be noted in the above illustrated scheme that deprotection occurs at both the C-7 position and in the side chain bearing the triethylsilyl (TES) group.<br>
Paclitaxel made according to the process of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical dosage forms including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, infusion solutions/suspensions and injection concentrates. As will be clear to those skilled in the art, the above forms may be formulated using appropriate pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention: Example 1<br>
