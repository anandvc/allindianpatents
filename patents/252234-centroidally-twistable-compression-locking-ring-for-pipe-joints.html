				<td>Centroidally Twistable Compression Ring For Pipe Joints<br>
Field of Invention and Basic Summary<br>
A locking ring designed to work in a self restraining pipe joint. This locking ring is<br>
designed (which may include attention to a combination of shape and material<br>
properties) to deform when exposed to a concentrated load and thereby distribute this<br>
load across broader area of the pipe joint to increase the thrust restraining capabilities of<br>
the joint<br>
Background and General<br>
A current state of the art self restraining pipe joint is commonly known as the TR<br>
FLEXÂ® Pipe joiint as manufactured by U.S. Pipe and Foundry Co. Inc. This is described<br>
in U.S. Patent 4,540,204 among others, which relies on individual locking segments<br>
engaging a weld bead on the spigot (male) end of one pipe with a cavity formed into the<br>
bell (female) end of the joining or mating pipe.<br>
Several areas for improvement have been identified concerning the prior art involving<br>
this concept. The first is that the individual locking segments may not fiilly engage the<br>
weld bead placed on the spigot end of the pipe imder all assembly conditions (including<br>
layout configujrations and dimensional variations). These conditions may be so severe<br>
that the segments may, in fact, miss the weld bead entirely. This condition will greatly<br>
affect the thrust restraining capability of the joint. The second issue is that when the<br>
joint is deflected, the spigot approaches the bell at an angle instead of being concentric<br>
and parallel. This condition alters the longituduial gap between the segment cavity (the<br>
bell groove) in the bell of one pipe and the weld bead on the spigot end of the other<br>
pipe. In short, the gap has a varying magnitude of separation. This gap is what is<br>
typically bridged by the individual locking segments. Only the locking segment(s) in the<br><br>
area of the smallest gap therefore will be engaged, creating a concentrated load on the<br>
bell and spigot of the mating pipe. The tliird issue is that assembly may be difficult in all<br>
but the most ideal circumstances since the individual locking segments must slide into<br>
the gap between the spigot and bell of mating pipes and this gap must be kept small in<br>
order to allow the segments to engage both halves of the pipe joint. The fourth issue is<br>
that the joint is sensitive to manufacturing tolerances. If the tolerances are allowed to<br>
vary too much, then the locking segments may not engage the spigot end of the matmg<br>
pipe resulting in reduced joint performance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The following is a detailed exemplary description of an embodiment of the invention, in<br>
a number of its various aspects. Those skilled in the art will xmderstand that the<br>
specificitjf provided herein is intended for illustrative purposes with respect to an<br>
exemplarj,^ embodiment, only, and is not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the<br>
invention or claims.<br>
Turning to Figure 1, a cross-sectional view of a joint of the present invention is shown,<br>
with the locking ring 2, a substantially ring-shaped body in place to prevent extraction<br>
of the pipe spigot 6 from the bell I. In Figure 1, the locking ring 2 is shown in a resting<br>
state (intlie absence offerees exerted upon it in an angularly or radially displaced joint).<br>
As is apparent from the depiction in Figure 1, particularly to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, in the joint the pipe spigot 6 is partially disposed within the pipe bell 1 in sach a<br>
manner tiiat there is some aimular gap 20 between the two, but locking ring 2 has a<br>
greater radial height than the aimular gap 20. Accordingly, locking ring 2 cannot pass<br>
through tlie annular gap 2. The shown embodiments used by the inventors are pipes and<br>
bells of metal, specifically, ductile iron. Those in the art will understand that in normal<br>
assembly the locking ring 2 is inserted into the pipe bell 1, and disposed in the bell<br>
groove 12 prior to insertion of the pipe spigot 6 into the pipe bell 1. bell groove 12 may<br>
approximate the configuration of locking ring 2 as shown in Figure 1, but in any event<br>
the size of the bell groove 12 is greater than the size of the locking ring 2, so as to allow<br><br>
some freedom of movement of the locking ring 2 within the confines of bell groove 12<br>
(until the locking ring 2 is clamped in place or the joint is subjected to thrust loads).<br>
Because of this freedom of movement, the pipe spigot 6 can be inserted until at least the<br>
position showTi in Figure 1 by passing the weld bead 5 under the locking ring 2, such as<br>
occurs when locking ring 2 is held away from the pipe spigot 6 (e.g. by spring tension<br>
of the ring) or otherwise is not held firmly against pipe spigot 6. It will be appreciated<br>
from the drawing in Figure 1 that the weld bead 5 is axially inward (to the right in the<br>
drawmgs) of bell thrust face 4. Sealing, rmgs, such as gaskets, may be disposed at<br>
locations in tlie joint to provide fluid seal in addition to the restraint effected by the<br>
locking ring 2 of the present invention. By way of example, bell groove 12 in Figure 1<br>
is shown radially outward of (to the left of, in the drawings) such a seaUng area.<br>
As shown, pipe Bell 1 engages lockmg ring 2 via ring thrust face 3 and bell thrust face<br>
4. These surfa<jes faces are oriented in the embodiment shown at figure></jes>
approximately 30 degrees to a radial projecting from the centerline of the pipe bell. This<br>
mating angle dletermines the relationship of thrust load (restraint) to radial (locating)<br>
load. Restraint of the thrust load is ibe objective, but a minimal radial load is required to<br>
locate and retaiin the locking ring. The relationship of these two forces influences the<br>
overall restraint of the joint, and is addressed by the invention. The locking ring 2 is<br>
located between bell thrust face 4 and the weld bead 5. The locking ring is clamped to<br>
the outside surface of the pipe spigot 6 during assembly such that the inside comer 7 of<br>
the locking ring engages the weld bead 5, such engagement occurring at least when the<br>
pipe spigot 6 is idrawn outward of the pipe bell I. The load patii is thus complete. Thrust<br>
is transferred from the pipe bell 1 to the locking ring 2 via the thrust faces (3 and 4) and<br>
then to the pipe spigot 6 via the inside comer 7 and weld bead 5 interface. After initial<br>
assembly, the action of the bell groove 12 around the locking ring 2 may render<br>
continued use of the clamping force unnecessary in some embodiments. As shown in<br>
the Figures, ring spigot face 9, and m fact locking ring 2, is not mtended to bite into or<br>
cause deformation of the pipe spigot 6, as the resistance to movement is imparted by the<br>
weld bead 5. In the shown embodiments it is therefore devoid of teeth adapted to bite<br>
into pipe spigot 6.<br><br>
Non-exhaustive examples of ways to clarnp the locking ring 2 to the outside surface of<br>
pipe spigot 6 include use of a ring with a resting configuration having a smaller<br>
diameter than the pipe spigot 6 (which Ciui be manually expanded to allow passage of<br>
the weld bead 5 thereunder) or use of csdipers or other mechanisms to draw the split<br>
ends of the locking ring 2 together after weld bead 5 has passed by the locking ring 2 on<br>
its passage into the pipe bell 1. As shown in Figures 3 through 8, a particularly shown<br>
embodiment of the invention uses ears ("tabs") at the split ends of the locking ring 2,<br>
which tabs extend axially of the locking ring 2 (i.e., they are perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the locking ring 2). These tabs in tlie shown drawings are configured to extend<br>
outside of the pipe bell 1 even while locking ring 2 is within the bell groove 12,<br>
allowing them to be gripped, ratcheted together, bolted in place, or otherwise acted on<br>
in a way to diraw the split ends of locking ring 2 together, or to press locking ring 2 into<br>
clamped association with the pipe spigot 2. In one configuration used by the inventors,<br>
the pipe bell 1 includes a slot or cut-out at some point along its outer face 13, which slot<br>
or cut-out is big enough to allow passage of the tabs therethrough. Alternatively, the<br>
tabs could be configured to pass through the annular gap 20 to become accessible<br>
outside of the pipe bell 1. As seen from the immediately preceding paragraph, when the<br>
locking ring 2 is clamped to the pipe spigot 6, either by way of a clampmg force<br>
generated as discussed in this paragraph, or by the action of the pipe bell 1 around the<br>
locking ring 2, the locking ring 2 caimot slide outward of pipe bell 1 because it is<br>
greater in radial height than the height of annular gap 20, and weld bead 5 cannot slide<br>
past locking ring 2 because of its abutment with pipe spigot 6. As suggested in the<br>
preceding panagraph, and as would be understood from the drawing in Figure 1, the<br>
abutment of locking ring 2 and pipe spigot 6 is furthCT ensured (during movement of the<br>
pipe spigot 6 outward of pipe bell 1, which is movement of the pipe spigot 6 to the left<br>
in Figure 1) by the feet that bell thrust face 4 and ring thrust face 3 meet at an angle<br>
which results in a "sliding wedge" action. In other words, for every imit of movement<br>
of locking ring 2 in an outward direction of the pipe bell 1 (i.e., to the left in Figure 1),<br>
the locking ring 2 is also urged radially inwardly, which is toward more forced contact<br>
with the pipe spigot 6.<br><br>
When the centerHnes of the two halves of the mating joint (e.g. the pipe bell 1 and the<br>
pipe spigot 6) are concentric, and ignoring manufacturing imperfections, the thrust load<br>
is evenly distibuted annularly around the mating surfaces of the locking ring 2. If the<br>
joint is deflected such that the centerline of one half of the joint (e.g. bell or spigot) is no<br>
longer concentric with the centerline of the other half of the joint (i.e. one centerline is<br>
offset by an angular or radial displacement), then the load is no longer evenly<br>
distributed annularly around the locking ring, but is concentrated in a specific region of<br>
the ring. This region of concentrated load is generally located at the closest longitudinal<br>
point between the bell thrust face 4 and the weld bead 5. Current state of the art<br>
restrained joints would suffer reduced performance (e.g. a reduced ability to withstand<br>
full thrust loads) due to this concentrated loading condition. In this invention, the one<br>
piece locking iring 2 distributes this concentrated load by twisting (deforming) about its<br>
centroidal axis. This twisting alters the apparent longitudinal length of the locking ring,<br>
and allows the locking ring to bridge a constantly varying gap between the bell thrust<br>
face 4 and the weld bead 5 Where the joint is not displaced, the locking ring 2, as<br>
shown in Figure 1, does not twist See, for example, Figure 9, which shows a locking<br>
ring 2 in position ia an angularly displaced joint. As shown in Hhe Figure 9, locking ring<br>
2 is twisted about its centroidal axis (see that the ring spigot face 9 is essentially<br>
horizontal, or parallel to the bell axis, in the upper locations at location x and at the<br>
same time is at an angle essentially parallel to the axis of the Spigot 6, at location y,<br>
which can only occur if the locking ring 2 is twisting along its length). By way of<br>
example, the action of this twisting causes the ring to rotate about the centroidal axis at<br>
one location to a greater degree (or even in a different direction) than at another location<br>
along the locking ring 2, such as would occur if a rubber ring stretched over a tube were<br>
held in place in one location, and were rolled along the surface of the tube at another<br>
location. Figure 10 shows a more extremely deflected joint, also depictiug twisting.<br>
Figure 11 shov/s a cut-away of the locking ring 2, depicting the twisting by showing a<br>
cut-away of the locking Ring 2 resting on a flat surface, to exemplify the twisting that<br>
can occur. This ability of the locking ring to twist is affected by the shape of the cross<br>
section of the locking ring and the material properties of the ring.<br><br>
In practice, in a deflected joint wherein tlie locking ring 2 has twistid, the ring spigot<br>
face 9 may eiojoy a range of angular relationships to the pipe spigot 6. That is, varying<br>
angles may be presented between the ring spigot face 9 and the pipe spigot 6 along the<br>
ring's inner circumferential length. By way of example, it may be substantially flat<br>
(parallel) abutoent to pipe spigot 6 at some locations, while the ring outside comer 11<br>
or the inside comer 7 (or both at different locations) rise to varying degrees along the<br>
length.<br>
In the shown embodiments, for instance, the cross sectional shape of the ring is<br>
generally a trapezoid (if ring top 10 is considered a "side"; otherwise, consistent with<br>
the dravmg shown it could be considered a triangular cross section) with a horizontal<br>
bottom surface:, a ring thrust fece 3 of about 30 degrees (measured from the vertical), a<br>
ring back face 8 of about 10 degrees (measured firom the vertical) and overall<br>
dimensions of approximately about 1 inch high by about 1 inch wide (as seen from the<br>
figures, the edges may be rounded, rather than coming to precise points). The material<br>
in the shown instance is 65-45-12 Ductile Iron. The weight for a ring as shown in the<br>
embodiment depicted in the drawings, assuming an inner diametCT of 44.3 inches and<br>
ear length of 4.5 inches has been seen to be approximately 27.8 lbs. As shown from<br>
Figures 3, 4, 5, and 7, the locking ring 2 in its resting state is essentially flat along its<br>
plane (i.e., is not yet twisted, the twisting occurring, as discussed above, in response to<br>
radial or particularly angular displacement).<br>
The ring thrust face 3 angle in the shown embodiment matches the angle of the bell<br>
thrust face 4, though precise matching is not required. This angle typically is between<br>
about 10 and about 45 degrees from a direct radial line (vertical) and is dependent on<br>
the desired ratio between thrust (longitudmal) load and radial load. Overall length and<br>
width of the cross section can be any desired value corresponding to the strength and<br>
stiffiiess desired. The back fece can be any angle between 0 and 60 degrees depending<br>
on the desired stiffness (resistance to twist) and location of the centroid. The material<br>
may be any material of suitable ductility and resistance to bearmg stress.<br><br>
In some embodiments the invention allows the joint to maintain substantially its full<br>
thrust restraint rating over substantially the full range of assembly conditions (including<br>
layout configurations and dimensional variations) whereas joints of the prior art may<br>
exhibit reduced performance in some assembly conditions.<br>
Likewise, in some embodiments, the invention allows quicker and easier assembly in<br>
the field over the prior art. Some embodiments of the invention may allow the use of<br>
larger manufacturing tolerances in the pipe bell without risk of losing contact with the<br>
mating pipe's Aveld bead. Some embodiments of the invention allow the potential<br>
reduction of mjanufacturing cost of the joint through reduced material requirements<br>
compared to rigid rings or individual segments.<br>

19. A locking ring as in Claim 10, which is devoid of teeth capable of substantially<br>
biting into a pipe spigot of the second pipe.<br>
20. A pipe joint comprising<br>
a. A first pipe comprising a pipe bell and a bell groove disposed annxilarly<br>
within the pipe bell, said bell groove being bounded on an axially<br>
outward side by a bell thrust surface,<br>
b. A second pipe comprising a pipe spigot and a weld bead located on the<br>
pipe spigot, said pipe spigot located partially within the pipe bell in a<br>
position in which the weld bead is further, by an axially measured<br>
distance, within the pipe bell than is the bell thrust surface, wherein the<br>
pipe spigot is radially separated from the pipe bell at a location around<br>
the pipe spigot periphery by an aimular gap, and<br>
c. A locking ring being located between and in substantially continuous<br>
contact vv^ith the bell thrust surface and with the weld bead, which bell<br>
thrust surface and weld bead are separated by a gap having different<br>
measurements when measured at different locations in the pipe joint.<br>
21. A pipe joint as in Claim 20, wherein the locking ring comprises at least one<br>
cross-sectional dimension greater than a distance of the annular gap.<br>
22. A pipe joint as in Claim 20 in which the locking ring twists in response to<br>
angular displacement of an axis of the first pipe from an axis of the second pipe.<br>
23. A pipe joint as in Claim 20 in which the locking ring twists in response to radial<br>
displacement of an axis of the first pipe from an axis of the second pipe.<br>
24. A pipe joint as in Claim 20 in which the bell thrust surface is disposed at an<br>
angle of between 10 degrees and 45 degrees oflF of radial.<br>
25. A pi|:&gt;e joint as in Claim 20 in which the locking ring comprises a ring back face<br>
that is disposed at an angle of approximately 10 degrees off of radial<br><br><br>
A locking ring designed to work in a self restraining pipe joint. This locking ring is<br>
designed (which may include attention to a combination of shape and material<br>
properties) to twist when exposed to a concentrated bad and thereby distribute this<br>
load across broader area of the pipe joint to increase the thrust restraining capabilities<br>
of the joint.</td>
