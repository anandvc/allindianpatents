IWafled description nf different emhftiBments<br>
Each cotton Hnt fiber is a single cell that elongates to 2.5 to 3.0 cm form the seed coat epidermis within -16 days after anthesis(DAA). Roan et aL 2001 (The Plant Cell 13: pp 47-60) found that this elongation process was controlled by gating of the plasmodesmata and coordinated expression of sucrose and K+ transporters and expansin. Single celled cotton fibers interconnect with the underlying seed coat only at their base regions, where a high number of plasmodesmata axe present Plasmodesmata are the intercellular cytoplasmic connections that act as gates controlling molecular trafficking from cell to cell. During the rapid elongation ph<br>
(-10 to ~16 DAA), the symplastic connection was disrupted, allowing the rapid buildup of a turgor in the fiber cell, which is higher than in the underlying seed coat cells, by active solute import into the fiber celL Coordinated with the cell wall loosening (into alia by expansins), tins higher turgor pushes out the fiber cell to its length. Ruan et aL also examined the possibility that callose deposition at die neck region of the plasmodesmata was implicated in the closing thereof; but found no correlation using a monoclonal antibody against callose, between the deposit of callose and the closing an4 reopening of the plasmodesmata.<br>
The current invention is based on the observations by the inventors that on the one hand, the length of the period of the closing of plasmodesmata in different cotton cultivars is correlated with the variation in fiber length, and on the other hand, that callose deposition is involved in the closure of the plasmodesmata. Additionally, it was observed that the timing and the level of expression of a fiber-specific P-1,3-ghicanase gene among three cotton cultivars differing in fiber length correlated with the degradation of callose in the plasmodesmata.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for altering the length of a fiber of a fiber-producing plant, such as a cotton plant, comprising die step of altering the fiber cell elongation phase by modulating the deposition of callose at the neck of the plasmodesmata at the base of the fiber celL<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
Conveniently, the deposition of callose may be altered by introduction of a chimeric gene capable of modulating the deposition of callose at the neck of the plasmodesmata at the base of the fiber celL Ibis maybe achieved eg. by increasing the expression level and/or the activity of the encoded product of a gene involved in callose removal, such as a p-1,3 ghicanase. Deposition of callose may also be altered by increasing the expression level and/or the activity of Hie encoded product of a gene involved in callose synthesis and accumulation) such as a P-13 gtucan synthase (callose synthase).<br>
In one embodiment, the drimeric gene may encode a silencing RNA molecule or an inhibitory RNA molecule, capable of reducing the expression of a gene involved in callose removal from the plasmodesmata at the base of the fiber cell to increase fee fiber length. Such reduction of the expression of a gene involved in callose removal should occur preferably through post-transcriptional silencing. However, it will be dear that even when an inhibitory SNA molecule decreases the expression of a gene involved in callose removal through post-transcriptional silencing, such an SNA molecule may also exeat other functions within a cell, such as guiding DNA methylation of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal, again ultimately leading to decreased expression of that gene. Also, expression of endogenous genes involved in callose removal may be reduced by transcriptional silencing, e.g. by using RNAi or dsRNA targeted against the promoter region of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal.<br>
Several methods are available in the art to produce a silencing RNA molecule, ie. an RNA molecule which when expressed reduces the expression of a particular gene or group of genes, including the so-called "sense" or "antisense" RNA technologies.<br>
Thus in one embodiment, the inhibitory RNA molecule encoding drimeric gene is based on the so-called antisense technology. In other words, the coding region of the chimeric gene comprises a nucleotide sequence of at least 20 consecutive nucleotides of the complement of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal of the plant Such a chimeric gene may be constructed by operably linking a DNA fragment comprising at least 20 nucleotides from a gene involved in<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
callose removal, isolated or identified as described elsewhere in tins application, in inverse orientation to a plant expressible promoter and 3* end formation region involved in transcription termination and polyadenylation. It wfll be clear that there is no need to know the exact nucleotide sequence or the complete xnicleotide sequence of such a DNA fragment fiom the isolated gene involved in callose removaL<br>
In another embodiment, the inhibitory RNA molecule encoding chimeric gene is based on fee so-called co-suppression technology. In other words, the coding region of the chimeric gene comprises a nucleotide sequence of at least 20 consecutive nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal of the plant Such a chimeric gene may be constructed by operably linking a DNA fragment comprising at least 20 nucleotides fiom a gene involved in callose removal, isolated or identified as described elsewhere in this application, in direct orientation to a plant expressible promoter and 3* end formation region involved in transcription termination and polyadenylation. Again, it will be clear that there is no need to know the exact nucleotide sequence or the complete nucleotide sequence of such a DNA fragment fiom the isolated gene involved in callose removaL<br>
The efficiency of the above mentioned chimeric genes in reducing the expression of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal may be further enhanced by the inclusion of DNA element which result in the expression of aberrant, unpolyadenylated inhibitory SNA molecules or results in the retention of the inhibitory RNA molecules in the nucleus of the cells. One such DNA element suitable for that purpose is a DNA region encoding a self-splicing ribozyme, as described in WO 00/01133 (incorporated by reference). Another such DNA element suitable for that purpose is a DNA region encoding an RNA nuclear localization or retention signal, as described in PCT/AU03/00292 published as WO03/076619 (incorporated by reference).<br>
A convenient and very efficient way of downregulating the expression of a gene of interest uses so-called double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or interfering RNA (RNAi), as described e.g. in WO99/53050 (incorporated by reference). In this technology, an RNA molecule is introduced into a plant cell, whereby the RNA molecule is capable of forming a double stranded RNA region over at least about 19 to about 21<br><br>
 2005/017157	»CT/AU2004/001076<br>
nucleotides, and whereby one of the strands of this double stranded KNA region is about identical in nucleotide sequence to the target gene ("sense region"), whereas the other strand is about identical in nucleotide sequence to the complement of the target gene or of the sense region fantisense region**). It is expected that for silencing of the target gene expression, the nucleotide sequence, of the 19 consecutive nucleotide sequences may have one mismatch, or the sense and antisense region may differ in one nucleotide. To achieve the construction of such SNA molecules or the encoding cMmeric genes, use can be made of the vector as described in WO 02/059294.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a method for increasing the length of a fiber of a fiber producing plant, such as cotton, is provided comprising the step of introducing a chimeric gene into a cell of the fiber producing plant, wherein the chimeric gene comprises the following opcrably linked DNA elements:<br>
(e)	a plant expressible promoter, preferably a plant expressible promoter which<br>
 controls transcription preferentially in the fiber cells;<br>
(f)	a transcribed DNA region, which when transcribed yields a double-stranded<br>
KNA molecule capable of reducing the expression of a gene endogenous to the<br>
fiber producing plant; the gene being involved in caUose removal from the<br>
plasmodesmata, and the RNA molecule comprising a first and second RNA<br>
 region wherein<br>
i)   the first RNA region comprises a nucleotide sequence of at least 19<br>
consecutive nucleotides having at least about 94% sequence identity to the<br>
nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene; ii) the second RNA region comprises a nucleotide sequence complementary<br>
 to the at least 19 consecutive nucleotides of the first RNA region; iif) the first and second RNA region are capable of base-pairing to form a<br>
double stranded RNA molecule between at least the 19 consecutive<br>
nucleotides of fee first and second region; and<br>
(g)	a 3' end region comprising transcription termination and polyadenylaticm<br>
 signals functioning in cells of the plant<br>
As used herein "comprising" is to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components as referred to, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more features, integers, steps or components, or groups<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
thereof. Thus, e.g., a nucleic acid or protein comprising a sequence of nucleotides or amino acids, may comprise more nucleotides or amino acids than the actually cited ones, le.» be embedded in a larger nucleic add or protein. A chimeric gene comprising a DKA region, which is functionally or structurally defined, may comprise additional DKA regions etc.<br>
The length of the first or second RNA region (sense or antisense region) may vary fiom about 19 nucleotides (nt) up to a length equaling the length (in nucleotides) of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal. Hie total length of Hie sense or antisense nucleotide sequence may Urns be at least at least 25 nt, or at least about 50 nt, or at least about 100 nt, or at least about ISO nt, or at least about 200 nt, or at least about 500 nt It is expected that there is no upper limit to file total length of the sense or the antisense nucleotide sequence. However for practical reasons (such as e.g. stability of the chimeric genes) it is expected that the length of the sense or antisense nucleotide sequence should not exceed 5000 nt, particularly should not exceed 2500 nt and could be limited to about 1000 nt<br>
It will be appreciated that the longer the total length of the sense or antisense region, the less stringent the requirements for sequence identity between these regions and the corresponding sequence in the endogenous gene involved in callose removal or its complement Preferably, the nucleic add of interest should have a sequence identity of at least about 75% with die corresponding target sequence, particularly at least about SO %» more particularly at least about 85%, quite particularly about 90%, especially about 95%, more especially about 100%, quite especially be identical to the corresponding part of the target sequence or its complement However, it is preferred that the nucleic acid of interest always includes a sequence of about 19 consecutive nucleotides, particularly about 25 nt, more particularly about 50 nt, especially about 100 nt, quite especially about 150 nt with 100% sequence identity to the corresponding part of the target nucleic acid. Preferably, for calculating the sequence identity and designing the corresponding sense or antisense sequence, the number of gaps should be minimized, particularly for die shorter sense sequences*<br>
For the purpose of this invention, the "sequence identity" of two related nucleotide or amino acid sequences, expressed as a percentage, refers to the number of positions in<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
the two optimally aligned sequences winch have identical residues (xlOO) divided by the number of positions compared A gap, Le. a position in an alignment where a residue is present in one sequence but not in the other, is regarded as a position with non-identical residues. The alignment of the two sequences is performed by the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch 1970). The computer* assisted sequence alignment above, can be conveniently performed using standard software program such as GAP which is part of the Wisconsin Package Version 10.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madision, Wisconsin, USA) using the default scoring matrix with a gap creation penalty of SO and a gap extension penalty of 3.<br>
It will be clear that whenever nucleotide sequences of KNA molecules axe defined by reference to nucleotide sequence of corresponding DNA molecules, the thynrine (T) in the nucleotide sequence should be replaced by uracil (U). Whether reference is made to RNAorDNA molecules will be clear from the context of the application,<br>
dsRNA encoding chimeric genes according to the invention may comprise an intron, such as a heteroiogous mtron, located e.g. in the spacer sequence between the sense and antisense SNA regions in accordance with the disclosure of WO 99/53050 (incorporated herein by reference).<br>
As used herein, an "endogenous gene involved in callose removal** is a gene whose expression product regulates or catalyzes the breakdown of callose deposited at a particular location in plants* "Callose" is a long-chain carbohydrate polymer, consisting of (5-1,3-glucan, that seals certain regions, e.g., damaged sieve elements, growing pollen tubes, or plasmodesmata.<br>
As used herein, an "endogenous gene" is a gene that naturally occurs in the species of the fiber-producing plant that has been chosen for modulation of fiber characteristics, or a gene that occurs naturally in a species of another fiber-producing plant but may be introduced into the species of the fiber-producing plant that has been chosen for modulation of fiber characteristics, by conventional breeding techniques.<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
A target gene involved in caUose removal from piasmodesmata at the base of fiber cells in fiber-producing plants such as cotton, is an endo-13-p-ghicanase gene that is naturally expressed at the base of the fiber cell, at the end of fiber elongation phase*. An example of such a l,3-{3-glucanase gene from cotton, is a gene encoding a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No 4 or comprising the nncleotide sequence of SEQ ID I (or Genbank Accession number D88416). Shimuzu et aL (Plant Cell Physiology 38 (3), pp 375-378, L997) have described that the level of mRNA for endo-13-P-gbcanase was very low in elongating fiber cells, but increased gradually at the onset of secondary wall synthesis, accompanying the massive deposition of cellulose, but characterized this endo-l,3~P-gtocanase activity as required for the deposition of cellulose. The current invention has correlated the endo-l^-P-ghicanasc activity with caHose removal in different cotton variety with different lengths of fiber elongation phases.<br>
Variants of the endo-l,3-P-ghicanase gene involved in removal of caUose from plasmodesmata at the base of elongating fiber cells, such as the endogenous genes coding for endo-l»3-p~glucanase from fiber producing plants different from cotton, maybe found by stringent hybridization using the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No 1, or a pact thereof comprising at least about 25 or SO consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID No 1 or the complementary nucleotide sequences thereof as a probe.<br>
"Stringent hybridization conditions1" as used herein means that hybridization will generally occur if there is at least 95% and preferably at least 97% sequence identity between the probe and the target sequence. Examples of stringent hybridization conditions are overnight incubation in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5x Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfete, and 20 jig/ml denatured, sheared carrier DNA such as salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the hybridization support in 0.1 x SSC at approximately 65 °C, preferably for about 10 minutes. Other hybridization and wash conditions are well known and are exemplified in Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), particularly chapter 11.<br><br>

Variants of these sequences may be obtamed by substitution* deletion or addition of particular mtcleotides, and such variants may also be suitable for the currently described methods and means, particularly if they retain endo-p-13-glucan synthase activity.<br>
It will be clear that the methods and means described herein to increase the length of fibers in fiber-producing plants may be combined with each other to further increase the length of fibers.<br>
The methods of the current application may of course also be combined with other methods to altar fiber characteristics as known in the art<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the methods of the current application are combined with those described in WO02/45485 whereby fiber quality in fiber producing plants, such as cotton* is modified by modulating sucrose synthase activity and/or expression in such plants. In a particular embodiment, cotton plants are provided comprising a chimeric gene as herein described, which when expressed in the cells of the fiber producing plants, such as the fiber base cells, increases die fiber eleongation phase and increases die deposition of callose and further comprising a chimeric gene as described in WO02/45485 (herein incorporated by reference) which when expressed results h* iiK-t^as^d «xprK&amp;sinn or activity of sucrose synthase. It is expected that the combined expression of the genes will result in a synergistic effect on the increase of the fiber length and/or strength.<br>
The chimeric genes may be introduced by subsequent transformation into cells of one plant, or may be combined into cells of one plant by crossing between plants comprising one chimeric gene each.<br>
I Furthermore, the invention also provides cotton plants, combining (a) natural occurring allele(s) of the fiber preferential /3-1,3-glucanase gene(s) associated with longer closing of the plasmodesmata gates and with long fiber length and (a) natural<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
occurring allele(s) of (a) sucrose synthase gene(s) resulting in high expression of sucrose synthase in fiber cells.<br>
It is also expected that the methods described here to increase the fiber elongation phase and fiber length, particularly the reduction of expression of the endogenous gene involved in callose removal, will also lead to increased drought resistance, particularly of the fibers.<br>
For some fiber-producing plants, it may sometimes be beneficial to decrease fiber length, particularly eliminate fiber production. Tins can be achieved according to the invention by shortening the fiber elongation phase through decreased callose deposition or increased callose removal. To tins end, chimeric genes may be introduced which when expressed decrease callose deposition or increase callose removal.   Such chimeric genes may comprise the following operably linked DNA<br>
-	a plant-expressible promoter, preferably a plant-expressible promoter which<br>
controls transcription preferentially in fiber cells;<br>
•    a DNA region encoding a gene involved in callose removal, such as a 0-1,3 glucanase protein; and<br>
-	a 3'end region comprising transcription termination and polyadenylation signals<br>
functioning in cells of that plant;<br>
or<br>
-	a plant expressible promoter which controls transcription preferentially in fiber<br>
cells;<br>
-	a transcribed DNA region, which when transcribed yields a double-stranded SNA<br>
molecule capable of reducing the expression of a gene endogenous to the fiber<br>
producing plant, the gene being involved in callose deposition, such as a callose<br>
synthase, in the plasmodesmata at the base of a fiber cell, and wherein the RNA<br>
molecule comprising a first and second RNA region wherein<br>
- fiie first SNA region comprises a nucleotide sequence of at least 19 consecutive nucleotides having at least about 94% sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence of the mentioned endogenous gene;<br><br>

tbe 19 consecutive nucleotides of the first RNA region; -    the first and second RNA region are capable of base-pairing to form a double<br>
stranded RNA molecule between at least fte 19 consecutive nucleotides of the<br>
first and second region; and<br>
-    a 3* end region comprising transcription termination and polyadenylation signals functioning in cells of die fiber producing plant<br>

In wither embodiment, a method for identifying allelic variations of the involved in fiber length and/or drought resistance in a population of different genotypes or varieties of a particular plant species, preferably a fiber-producing plant species, which axe correlated either alone or in combination with the quantity and/or quality of fiber production is provided These method includes the following steps:<br>

nucleotide sequences encoding caUose synthase or p-l»3-glucanase, such as<br>
nucleotide sequences comprising SEQ ID No 1 or 2. The different allelic forms<br>

Such reduction of expression of the endogenous p-13-glucanasc genes can be conveniently achieved by posttranscriptional or transcriptional silencing as herein described, or may be achieved by inactivation, such as by deletion, of the endogenous {3-13-gtocanase genes. Introduction of the allelic forms may be achieved by breeding techniques, or by transformation with the isolated genes.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1: Corrdatioii of the dnration of the dosvre of the plasmodesmata with the length of fibers, in different cotton cultivars*<br>
The gating status of fiber plasmodesmata (PD) was examined among three tetraploid cotton cultivate Gh-r,Gh-c and Gb, with short, normal and long fiber, respectively, by using confocal imaging of a membrane-impermeable fluorescent molecule CF. As summarized in Fig 1, the genotype Gh^r, with the shortest fiber, does not close its fiber PD. In contrast, the long fiber genotype, Gb&gt; closes PD earlier and longer than the intermediate line (Gh-c). A tetraploid lintless mutant {fls\ which produces fuzz-like fiber of less than 0.5 cm, does not close its fiber PD.<br>
It was also found that, among the dipkrid progenitor of cotton cultivars, an A genome line Ga closes fiber PD for - 10 d and produces about 1.5 cm long fiber, while a D genome fine, Gt, does not close PD and virtually no fiber elongation occurs.<br>
These data demonstrate that the genotypic differences in duration of PD closure positively correlate with fiber length.<br>
Example 2: Analysis of caUose deposition at the base of the fiber cells in different cotton cultivars.<br>
Hie molecular basis of PD gating is virtually unknown. However, caUose deposition at the neck region of PD has been shown to close PD in several plant systems. Callose deposition was analyzed using a callose-specific stain, aniline blue. The timing and duration of callose deposition in fiber base, judged from fluorescent signals of aniline blue, matched with that of PD closure in Gh-c and Gb. Representative images from the genotype Gh-c axe presented in Fig 2 (A-C). Callose was undetectable in the fiber base at 5 and 20 DAA when PD were open but became readily detectable at 10 DAA when PD closed (Fig 2). Similar results were obtained by using antibody against callose. The inununo-gold labelled callose signals were detected at the fiber base at 10 DAA (Fig 2E), but not at 5 (Fig 2D) or 20 DAA. At the EM level, callose was localized to the PD at the fiber base (Fig 2F).<br><br>
WO 2005/017157	PCT/AU2004/001076<br>
These results show that callose deposition correlates with the closure of fiber PD.<br>
Example 3: Analysis of the expression of a fiber-specific β-l,3-gliicanase gene (Ghdacl) In cotton.<br>
To analyze the rote of (3-1,3 glucanase in the molecular mechanism of PD closure/ reopening, a partial 0-1,3 glucanase cDNA (GhGlucI) from cotton fiber mRNA was cloned (using the sequence information with Geribaak accession number D88416). Fig 3 shows that the mRNA of this gene is expressed only at 20 DAA (matching with the timing of callose disappearance- see Fig 2 C) and not at 10-12 DAA in Gh-c9 when callose was present at the fiber base (see Figs 2 B and E). Consistently, the GhGlucI was not expressed at - 6 DAA ( Fig 3) when callose has not been produced (Fig 2 A). Significantly, at 20 DAA, the mRNA levels of the gene axe strongest, weaker and undetectable in Gh-rt Gh-c and Gbt representing short, intermediate and long fiber cultivars, respectively (Fig 3). The expression of this gene is fiber specific as its mRNA is undetectable in 6-d young seed (Fig 3), embryo, shoot or root<br>
Taken together, the data show that the expression of GhGlucI is fiber- and developmental-specific. The timing and the level of the GhGlucI expression among the three cultivars differing in fiber length suggest that GhGlucI is responsible for the degradation of callose in the PD, which either prevents PD closure (e.g. in Gh-r) or allows PD to re-open (e.g. in Gh-c)9 hence shortens the elongation period<br>
