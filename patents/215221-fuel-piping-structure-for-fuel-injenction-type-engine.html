COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"FUEL PIPING STRUCTURE FOR FUEL-INJECTION-TYPE ENGINE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
5-6-2007<br><br>
[Detailed Description of   the  Invention]<br>
[OJOS-14-<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel piping structure for supply fuel to a fuel-injection-type engine, and more particularly to a fuel piping structure which facilitates the connection between a fuel pipe and an injector.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The injector of a fuel-injection-type engine has an injection port side inserted into a connection hole communicating with an intake passage and fixed to an engine by a separate holder, and is supplied with fuel from a fuel pump via a fuel pipe which is connected to the holder. According to another design, a portion of a fuel pipe which is connected to an injector is made of a rigid metal, and fixed to an engine, so that the portion of the fuel pipe functions as a holder (see, for example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Sho 61-36176 and Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-149313).<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Since the above conventional injector needs to be fixed to the engine by the holder, the holder has to be<br>
2<br><br>
attached to the injector and then fixed to the engine by suitable fixing means such as clips, bolts.  Therefore, the amount of work involved in installing the injector and the number of parts required are large. There have been demands for a reduction in the amount of work and the number of parts, and a simplified process of connecting the fuel pipe.  This holds true for the structure in which the portion of the fuel pipe functions as a holder.  It is an object of the present invention to meet the above demands.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
To solve the above problems, in accordance with claim 1, a fuel piping structure for a fuel - injection-type engine for supplying fuel from a fuel pump via a fuel pipe to an injector installed in an intake passage of an engine is characterized in that the injector is directly fixed to the intake passage, and a connector is mounted on the fuel pipe at least at an end thereof for connection to the injector, the connector being fitted over the injector and directly fixed thereto for preventing removal.<br>
An invention according to claim 2 is characterized in that, in claim 1, the connector has removal prevention<br>
3<br><br>
means engaging both the injector and the connector, and is connected to the injector in one operation.<br>
An invention according to claim 3 is characterized in that, in claim 2, the injector has a projection on a joint thereof for engaging the removal prevention means of the connector.<br>
[Effect of the invention]<br>
In the invention according to claim 1, since the injector is directly fixed to the intake passage, a holder which has heretofore been necessary is dispensed with, and when the connector mounted on at least one end of the fuel pipe is fitted over the injector, the connector is fixed for prevention of removal and directly coupled to the injector.  Therefore, the connection between the fuel pipe and the injector is simplified. Because the amount of work and fixing members such as bolts, clips involved in fixing the holder to the engine are dispensed with, the entire amount of work and the number of parts required are reduced, resulting in a reduction in the cost.<br>
According to claim 2, since the connector has the<br>
4<br><br>
removal prevention means engaging both the injector and the connector, the connector can be connected to the injector in one operation. [0008]<br>
According to claim 3, since the injector has the projection on the joint thereof for engaging the removal prevention means of the connector, it is possible to make the connection of the connector to the injector in one Dperation.<br>

[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment in which the present invention is applied to a motorcycle will be described below with reference to the drawings.  In the following description directions such as vertical or upward and downward, and leftward and rightward directions are referred to with respect to illustrations corresponding to descriptions, and longitudinal or forward and rearward directions are referred to"with respect to the directions of travel of the motor vehicle in use.  FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of a portion of the motorcycle to which the present invention is applied. A vehicle frame includes a main frame 1 extending in the longitudinal direction, a pivot plate 2 disposed vertically on a rear end of the main<br>
6<br><br>
frame 1, seat rails 3 extending obliquely upwardly and rearwardly from an intermediate portion of the main frame 1, and a rear frame 4 extending obliquely upwardly and rearwardly from the upper end of the pivot plate 2 and connected to the seat rails 3. [0010]<br>
A head pipe 5 is integrally mounted on the front end of the main frame 1, and a steering shaft, not shown, is angularly movably supported by the head pipe 5. An air cleaner 6 is suspended from a front portion of the main frame 1 near the head pipe 5, and an air-cooled four¬cycle engine 7 is suspended from the main frame 1 behind the air cleaner 6 by a hanger 8.  The engine 7 has a rear end portion supported on a mount 9 of the pivot plate 2.<br>
The pivot plate 2 has a pivot 10 by which the front end of a rear swing arm 11 is pivotally supported. A rear wheel, not shown, is supported on the rear end of the rear swing arm 11. A fuel tank 12 is supported on the seat rail 3. The fuel tank 12 is of a downwardly projecting shape including a portion which is lower than steps 12a on lower left and right sides and enters between the left and right seat rails 3. A cap 13 is mounted on an upper surface of the fuel tank 12. A seat<br>
&gt;-<br><br>
14 is openably and closably disposed over the fuel tank 12, and covers the cap 13 when it is closed.<br>
The fuel tank 12 houses a fuel pump unit 15 therein, and a fuel pipe 16 extending from the fuel pump unit 15 extends forwardly and is connected to an injector 17.  The fuel pipe 16 includes a suitable synthetic resin tube that is highly resistant to gasoline, and extends through a vehicle cover which comprises a front cover 18a, a rear cover 18b, and a tank cover 18c.<br>
The injector 17 is mounted on a throttle body 20 such that an injection port end thereof faces an intake passage 21 in an intake manifold 23.  The throttle body 20 extends in an upstream portion of the intake passage 21 into a clean side of the air cleaner 6, and has a throttle valve 22 disposed in the intake passage 21.  A downstream portion of the intake passage 21 is connected to an intake port of the engine 7 by an intake manifold 23.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view of an arrangement of a fuel piping. A joint pipe 24 projects upwardly from an upper portion of the fuel pump unit 15 and is bent substantially<br>
8<br><br>
horizontally in the rearward direction.  The joint pipe 24 has a ring-shaped projection 25 disposed around the substantially horizontal portion thereof. A quick connector 26 mounted on an end of the fuel pipe 16 is attached in one operation to the joint pipe 24 by the projection 25.<br>
The quick connector 26 is of a substantially L shape.  Since structural details of the quick connector 26 are essentially identical to a quick connector on the injector, as described later on, they will be described later on with respect to the quick connector on the injector.  In FIG. 2, the reference numeral 27 represents a strainer and 28 a liquid level sensor.<br>
The fuel pipe 16 extends downwardly beyond the fuel pump unit 15, extends obliquely downwardly forwardly below the fuel pump unit 15, changes its direction obliquely upwardly forwardly in its intermediate portion, then extends further forwardly, and is connected to the injector 17 by a quick connector 30. Thus, the two quick connectors 26, 30 are integrally mounted on the opposite ends of the fuel pipe 16.<br><br>
FIG. 3 shows at an enlarged scale the quick<br>
9<br><br>
connector 30 and the injector 17.  The quick connector 30 has a substantially V-shaped housing 31 including a portion as a tube joint 32 fitted in the end of the fuel pipe 16.  The tube joint 32 has its outer circumferential surface tapered and having cross -sectionally saw-toothed teeth thereon for making the tube joint 32 resistant to removal from the fitting portion of the fuel pipe 16.<br>
The housing 31 is made of a suitable material such as synthetic resin, metal which is relatively rigid, and is progressively thicker downwardly in FIG. 3, i.e., has a small-diameter portion 33, a medium-diameter portion 34, and a large-diameter portion 35.  The large-diameter portion 35 has openings 36 defined therein at suitable circumferentially spaced intervals.  O-rings 37 and an upper portion 39 of a retainer 38 are fitted in the medium-diameter portion 34. <br>
The retainer 3 8 corresponds to the removal prevention means according to the present invention.  The retainer 38 has an upper portion 39 as a small-diameter portion fitted in the medium-diameter portion 34 and a lower portion 40 as a large-diameter portion fitted in the large-diameter portion 35.  The lower portion 40 has a<br>
10<br><br>
tapered inner circumferential surface 41 progressively-spreading downwardly. A ring-shaped engaging groove 42 is defined in the retainer 38 at a junction between the tapered surface 41 and a straight inner circumferential surface of the upper portion 39.<br>
The lower portion 40 has a lower end as a projection 43 projecting in the axial direction of the small-diameter portion 33 and fitted in a thick portion 44 at the lower end of the large-diameter portion 35. The lower portion 40 has outer circumferential portions as side projections 45 fitted in the openings 36.<br>
The injector 17 has a joint 50 having substantially the same diameter as the inside diameter of the small -diameter portion 33 of the housing 31 and fitted in the housing 31. A ring-shaped projection 51 integrally projects outwardly from an intermediate portion of the joint 50.  The ring-shaped projection 51 is positioned for engagement in the engaging groove 42 in the lower portion 40.<br>
When the quick connector 30 is placed over the joint 50 of the injector 17, the upper end of the joint<br>
11<br><br>
50 enters the housing 31 from within the projection 43 at the lower end of the quick connector 30, passes through the large-diameter portion 35 and the O-rings 37, and is fitted in the small-diameter portion 33. At this time, the ring-shaped projection 51 is guided upwardly by the tapered surface 41, moves upwardly spreading the lower portion 40 outwardly, and is fitted in the engaging groove 42. -{0022]<br>
The joint 50 now engages the retainer 38 and is prevented from removal.  Since the retainer 3 8 engages the housing 31 with the side projections 45 fitted in the openings 36, the quick connector 3 0 is coupled to the joint 50 of the injector 17 by the retainer 38 against removal.  Therefore the quick connector 3 0 can be connected in one operation simply by being placed over the joint 50.<br>
A ring-shaped flange 52 integrally projects outwardly from a lower portion of the injector 17, and is fitted in and directly attached to locks 56 with a seal 53 interposed therebetween. The locks 56 are formed so as to surround the opening of a through hole 55 defined in an intake passage wall 54 of the throttle body 20 which<br>
12<br><br>
serves as part of the intake manifold 23. The injector 17 has a lower end 57 with an injection port defined therein. The lower end 57 is disposed in the through hole 55 and faces the intake passage 21. (ftfl243-<br>
The through hole 55 communicates with a curved portion of the intake manifold 23 which is directed obliquely upwardly.  Therefore, the injector 17 is installed downwardly such that the central axis of a jet of fuel injected from the lower end 57 of the injector 17 is directed substantially vertically toward the intake port of the combustion chamber, not shown, (see FIG. 1).<br>
FIG. 4 is a view of the locks 56 as an attachment seat for the injector 17, as viewed from above in the axial direction of the injector 17.  The locks 56 are formed as portions projecting radially inwardly in 180°-spaced symmetrical positions, and have fitting grooves 56a in lower portions thereof for fitting over the flange 52.  The flange 52 has small-diameter portions 58, 180° spaced apart from each other, whose outer circumferential surfaces are located radially inwardly of the inner circumferential surfaces of the locks 56, and large-diameter portions 59, 180° spaced apart from each other,<br>
13<br><br>
which are fitted in the fitting grooves 56a and underlie the locks 56 (see FIG. 3) .<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the lower end 57 is inserted into the through hole 55 with the small-diameter portions 58 aligned with the locks 56.  Thereafter, the injector 17 is turned about 90" clockwise (in the direction indicated by the arrow A) until the large-diameter portions 59 of the flange 52 are fitted into the fitting grooves 56a defined beneath the locks 56, whereupon the injector 17 is prevented from removal. Therefore, the injector 17 is directly fixed to the intake manifold without the need for a conventional holder. The fitting grooves 56a have ends closed as turn prevention portions 56b for preventing the injector 17 from being turned excessively clockwise or being installed while being turned counterclockwise (in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by the arrow A). <br>
Operation of the present embodiment will be described below. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the injector 17 itself is directly attached and fixed to the locks 56 which serve as part of the intake manifold 23.  Therefore, a conventional holder which is separate or integral as<br>
14<br><br>
part of the fuel pipe 16 is not required, and such a holder does not need to be fixed to the engine by bolts, clips, or the like. Therefore, the number of parts required and the amount of work involved in installing the injector are reduced. <br>
Since the quick connector 30 is integrally mounted on one end of the fuel pipe 16, when the quick connector 30 is placed over the injector 17, the quick connector 30 engages the injector 17 in one operation and is retained against removal.  Therefore, the fuel pipe 16 can be connected to the injector 17 simply and quickly.<br>
Because the ring-shaped projection 51 is disposed around the joint 50, the retainer 36 can be brought into engagement with the joint 50.  The quick connector 30 can be handled with ease because the quick connector 30 is integral with the fuel pipe 16.  In addition, the fuel pipe 16 can also be connected to the fuel pump unit 15 simply and quickly because the quick connector 26 is provided on the fuel pipe 16 for connection to the fuel pump unit 15.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
15<br><br>
embodiment, but may be modified and applied in various ways within the principles of the invention.  For example, the quick connectors 26, 30 are not restricted to the structure in the embodiment, but may have a conventional similar structure insofar as it has a removal prevention means such as the retainer 26 and can be connected in one operation.<br>
