				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   industrial   polyolefin   pipes   (single-or multilayer), fittings, valves and vessels.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to an industrial polyolefin piping system with improved stiffness, impact strength for use at high service temperature, comprising single or multilayer pipes, fittings, valves, chambers and vessels, consisting of a propylene homopolymer, as well as a process for producing them.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Pipes, injection molded parts and blow molded parts from propylene polymers are known (Moore, P., Polypropylene Handbook, Hanser Publishers Munich 1996, pp. 303-348). Of disadvantage of propylene polymer moldings from common propylene polymers are the insufficient impact properties of the moldings for industrial applications.<br>
Known methods for improving the impact properties are the use of blends comprising propylene polymers and butene polymers for producing pipes (EP 0 972 801), the use of blends comprising propylene polymers and hydrogenated butadiene-isoprene block copolymers for blow molded containers (JP 09,227,707) or the use of blends comprising propylene polymers and thermoplastic elastomers such as styrene-ethylene-butene-block copolymers or propylerie-ethylene-diene terpolymers for producing injection molded parts (DE 199 27 477). These molded articles have good impact properties, of disadvantage is however the reduced stiffness of the articles,<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an industrial polyolefin piping system with improved stiffness, impact strength for use at high service temperature, comprising pipes, fittings, valves and vessels from propylene polymers.<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, this object is achieved by an industrial polyolefin piping system with improved stiffness and impact strength for use at high service temperature, comprising single- or multilayer pipes, fittings, valves and vessels, consisting essentially of a propylene homopolymer with a melt index of 0.05 to 40 g/10 min at 230 C/2.16 kg,<br><br>
wherein the propylene homopolymer is p-nucleated and has an IRt ≥0.98, having a tensile modulus ≥1500 MPa, a Charpy impact strength at +23 °C of ≥30 kJ/m2, using notched test specimens, a Vicat B temperature ≥90 °C and a heat distortion temperature ≥100 °C.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
p-nucleated propylene polymers are isotactic propylene polymers composed of chains in a 3i helical conformation having an internal microstructure of B-form spherulites being composed of radial arrays of parallel stacked lamellae. This microstructure can be realized by the addition of fi-nucleating agents to the melt and crystallization. The presence of the 6-form can be detected through the use of wide angle X-ray diffraction (Moore, J., Polypropylene Handbook, p. 134-135, Manser Publishers Munich 1996).<br>
The  IRr of the  propylene  polymers is measured and calculated  as described  in<br>
EP 0 277 514 A2 on page 5 (column 7, line 53 to column 8, line 11).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the p-nucleated propylene homopolymers have an<br>
IRt of SO.985. The difference of 0.005 in IR-c, IRt being a measure for isotacticity,<br>
encompasses a significant increase in mechanical polymer properties, especially in<br>
stiffness.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the li-nucleated propylene polymers used for producing the industrial piping system have a melt index of 0.05 to 15 g/10min at 230 "C/2.16 kg, more preferably 0.1 to 8 g/10 min at 230 "C/2.16 kg, most preferably 0.2 to 5g/10minat230'C/2.16kg.<br>

For producing fittings and valves by injection molding propylene homopolymers with a melt index of 0.05 to 40 g/10 min at 230 "C/2.16 kg are particularly suitable. For vessel fabrication by blow molding a propylene homopolymer with a melt index of 0.05 to 20 g/10 min at 230 "/2.16 kg are particularly suitable.<br>
The propylene homopolymers used for producing the industrial piping system show a Charpy impact strength of ≥30 kJ/m2, preferably &gt;50 kJ/m2, most preferably ≥70 kJ/m2 at + 23 "C.<br>
According to an advantageous feature of the present invention, the fi-nucleated propylene polymers with an IRt so.98 of the industrial polyolefin piping system are propylene polymers obtained by polymerization with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system comprising titanium-containing solid components, an organoalumina, magnesium or titanium compound as cocatalyst and an external donor according to the formula<br>

25 wt% of a master batch comprising 99.5 parts by weight of a propylene homopolymer obtained by bulk polymerization using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system with dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane as external donor, having an IRt of 0.987 and a melt index of 13 g/10 min at 230 °C/2.16 kg, and 0.5 parts by weight of hexahydrophthaloylglycine calcium salt, and 0.1 wt% calcium stearate, 0.1 wt% tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-t-butylhy-droxyhydrocinnamate)] methane and 0.1 wt% tris-(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite, based on the sum of the propylene polymers used, is melted in a twin screw extruder with a temperature profile of 100/145/185/210/220/225/225/200/185 °C, homogenized, discharged and pelletized.The resulting polypropylene polymer has a melt index of 3.8 g/10 min at 230 °C/2.16 kg, a tensile modulus of 1700MPa and a Charpy impact strength, using notched test specimens, of 50 kJ/m2 at +23 CC.<br>
3.2      Manufacture of the test container with rectangular base for the industrial polyolefin piping system<br>
An injection stretch blowing equipment comprising a plasticizing unit with a three-zone screw, a turning table with a quadruple injection mold, a conditioning mold with three heating zones, a blowing mold with a stretching stamp and ejection equipment, the p-nucleated propylene polymer of 3.1 is melted in the plasticizing unit at a temperature profile of 100/150/200/225/215 °C and injected into the quadruple injection mold, which had been heated to 110 °C. The parison, weighing 30 g and having a wall thickness of 4.6 to 5.5 mm and a height of 96 mm, is taken by the sleeve of the turning table from the injection mold and brought by a swiveling motion of 90° of the turning table into the electrically heated conditioning mold, the heating zones of which are adjusted to a temperature of 131 °C (bottom of the container parison), of 134 °C (center part of the container parison) and of 131 °C (upper part of the container parison). After a conditioning period of 85 seconds, preblow-molding by compressed air is followed by removal of the blow-molded preform and transfer by means of the sleeve of the turning table by the swiveling motion of the turning table through 90° into the blowing mold, where the blow-molded preform initially is subjected to longitudinal stretching by the stretching stamp and subsequently molded by compressed air at a pressure of 20 bar. The longitudinal stretching of the preform in the blowing mold is 2.8 : 1 and the radial stretching of the preform is 2.0 : 1. After 8.0 seconds, the blow-molded control container with rectangular base is removed from the open blowing mold, supplied by the swiveling motion of the turning table through 90° to the ejector and ejected.<br>
To determine Vicat B temperature, test pieces were milled after the container shell was cut open. Vicat test results in a Vicat B temperature of 93 °C. A heat distortion temperature of 104 °C was determined.<br>
Example 4<br>
