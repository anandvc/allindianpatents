TRANSMISSION RATE CONTROL METHOD, MOBILE STATION,<br>
AND RADIO BASE STATION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is based upon and claims the benefit od priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. P2005-096543, filed on March 29, 2005; the entire contents oi which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission rate control method for controlling transmission rate of an uplink user data, a mobile station, and a radio base station.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a conventional mobile communication system, in at uplink from a mobile station UE to a radio base station Node B, a radio network controller RNC Is configured to determine a transmission rate of a dedicated channel, in consideratior of radio resources of the radio base station Node B, ar interference volume in an uplink, transmission power of the mobile station UE, transmission processing performance of the mobile station UE, a transmission rate required for an upper application, and the like, and to notify the determined transmission rate of the dedicated channel by a message of a layer-3 (Radio Resource Control Layer) to both of the mobile station UE and the radio base station Node B.<br><br>
Here, the radio network controller RNC Is provided at an upper level of the radio base station Node B, and is an apparatus configured to control the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE.<br>
In general, data communications often cause burst traffic compared with voice communications or TV communications. Therefore, it is preferable that a transmission rate of a channel used for the data communications is changed fast.<br>
However, as shown in FIG* 1, the radio network controller RNC integrally controls a plurality of radio base stations Node B in general. Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that it is difficult to perform fast control for changing of the transmission rate of channel (for example, per approximately 1 through 100 ms), due to processing load, processing delay, or the like*<br>
In addition, in the conventional radio network controller RNC, there has been also a problem that costs for implementing an apparatus and for operating a network are substantially increased even if the fast control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel can be performed*<br>
Therefore, In the conventional mobile communication system, control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel is generally performed on the order from a few hundred ms to a few seconds.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional mobile communication system, when burst data transmission is performed as shown in FIG. 2A, the data are transmitted by accepting low-speed, high-delay, and low-transmission efficiency as shown in FIG.<br><br>
2B, or, as shown in FIG. 2C, by reserving radio resources for high-speed communications to accept that radio bandwidth resources in an unoccupied state and hardware resources in the. radio base station Node B are wasted.<br>
It should be noted that both of the above-described radio bandwidth resources and hardware resources are applied to the vertical radio resources in FIGS* 2B and 2C.<br>
Therefore, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which are international standardization organizations of the third generation mobile communication system, have discussed a method for controlling radio resources at high speed in a layer-1 and a media access control (MAC) sub-layer (a layer-2) between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, so as to utilize the radio resources effectively. Such discussions or discussed functions will be hereinafter referred to as ‘Enhanced Uplink (EUL)”,<br>
As shown in a Non-Patent literature 1 (3GPP T5G-RAN TS25.309 v6 ♦ 2 • 0), in a conventional mobile communication system using the “Enhanced Uplink”, the radio base station Node B is configured to transmit an “Absolute Grant Channel (AGCH) * which includes an absolute value for the transmission rate of uplink user data (an “Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)”) to each mobile station UE, so as to control the transmission rate of the uplink user data (i.e* the transmission rate of the E-DPDCH for transmitting uplink user data).<br>
Each mobile station UE is configured to determine the transmission rate of the uplink user data (E-DPDCH) based on the absolute value included in the received AGCH,<br><br>
Generally, If not otherwise specified, a radio base station means a cell in the radio base station, in the field of the Enhanced Uplink (EUL). In the field of the Enhanced Uplink (EUL), each mobile station UE is received the AGCH from a sieving cell of the mobile station UE.<br>
Furthermore, generally, if not otherwise specified, a transmission rate includes a transport block size and a transmission power ratio (a ratio of an E-DPDCH transmission power to a DPCCH transmission power), in the field of the Enhanced Uplink (EUL). In addition, the AGCH includes a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI),<br>
Each mobile station UE is configured to determine whether or not the received AGCH is addressed for itself, using the Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) included in the AGCH.<br>
Further, as shown in a Non-Patent literature 2 (3GPP TSG-RAN R2-050438), there is a technique which enables a cell common transmission rate control which is common between cells and a mobile station individual transmission rate control which is individualised per mobile station UE, by having the plurality of Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) at one mobile Station UE.<br>
Generally, in the mobile communication system using the “Enhanced Uplink0, it is required to set an effective period to the AGCH. However, the length of the effective period required by the cell common transmission rate control and the mobile station individual transmission rate control is<br>
different.<br>
Generally, in the field of the Enhanced Uplink (EUL), the effective period can be set by using a elapse time since the<br><br>
AGCH is received (for example, 10 ms, 5 TTI (Transmission Time interval) or the like),<br>
in the field of the Enhanced Uplink (EUL), the effective period can he seen to set per HARQ prooess, as each HARQ process corresponds to a time interval or TTI (Transmission Time Interval). In the example of FIG. 14, the HARQ processes #4 to #8 are set as the effective period of the AGCH.<br>
The effective period to the AGCH, which includes a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) for the cell common transmission rate control, is short.<br>
Therefore, there has been a problem that when the specific one effective period to the AGCH is determined for both of the cell common transmission rate control and the mobile station individual transmission rate control, it is required to transmit the AGCH at frequent intervals, and the radio capacity in the downlink is decreased.<br>
In addition, the effective period to the AGCH, which includes a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RTNI) for the mobile station individual transmission rate control, is long.<br>
Therefore, there has been a problem that when the specific one effective period to the AGCH is determined for both of the cell common transmission rate control and the mobile station individual transmission rate control, it is not possible to allocate the transmission to each mobile station UE in fast, the scheduling becomes low speed, and the transmitting efficiency (throughput) in uplink is decreased.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made considering the problems, and its object is to provide a transmission rate control method, a mobile station and a radio base station, which can set optimal effective period to an Absolute Grant Channel per a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) for the cell common transmission rate control and a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) for an mobile station individual transmission rate control, increase a transmitting efficiency in uplink, and increase radio capacity in downlink.<br>
A first aspect of the present invention is summarized as a transmission rate control method for controlling a transmission rate of uplink user data, including: notifying, at a radio network controller, to a radio base station and a mobile station, an effective period to an Absolute Grant Channel which includes an absolute value for the transmission rate of the uplink user data; transmitting, at the radio network controller, the Absolute Grant Channel per Radio Network Temporary Identity, based on the notified effective period; and<br>
determining, at the mobile station, the transmission rate of the uplink user data based on the notified effective period, when receiving the Absolute Grant Channel per Radio Network Temporary Identity from the radio base station.<br>

and a radio network controller RNC.<br>
The mobile communication system according to this embodiment, a “High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)” is used in a downlink, and an “Enhanced Uplink (EUL)” is used in an uplink.<br>
It should be noted that in both of the HSDPA and the EUL, retransmission control (N process stop and wait) shall be performed by a “Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)”.<br>
Therefore, in an uplink, an “Enhanced Dedicated Physical Channel (E-DPCH)” configured of an “Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH)* and an ‘Enhanced Dedicated Physical Control Channel (E-DPCCH)”, and a “Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH)” configured of a “Dedicated Physical Date Channel (DPDCH) * and a “Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH)” are used.<br>

In addition, the E-DPDCH is paired with the E-DPCCH, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data for the EUL transmitted through the E-DPCCH.<br>
The DPCCH transmits control data such as a pilot symbol that is used for RAKE combining, SIR measurement, or the like, a Transport Format Combination Indicator (TPCI) for identifying a transmission format of uplink DPDCH, and a downlink power control bit in a downlink.<br><br>
In addition/ the DPDCH is paired with the DPCCH, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data transmitted through the DPCCH♦ However, if user data that should be transmitted does not exist in the mobile station UE, the DPDCH can be configured not to be transmitted.<br>

(Operations of Mobile Communication System According to First Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
Referring to PIG. 11, operations of the mobile communication system according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described. Here, FIG, 11 shows the example when the mobile station UE is calling. However, the present Invention can also be applied to the example when the mobile station UE is called*<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, in step S1001, the mobile station UE calls to the radio network controller RNC, in order to request a start of communication (a channel connection setup for user data) using the Enhanced Dedicated Physical Channel (E-DPCH).<br>
In step S1002, the radio network controller RNC requests a connection setup using the Enhanced Dedicated Physical<br><br>
Channel (E-DPDCH) to the radio base station Node B which controls the mobile station UE.<br>
In step S1003, when the E-DPDCH connection setup is completed, the radio base station Node B transmits a connection setup response for notifying the fact, to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step S1004, the radio network controller RNC transmits a control channel connection setup response to the mobile station UE.<br>
Here, the control channel connection setup response is used to setup a control channel connection for communicating information such as a type of user data, a resource number and transmittable/receivabie transmission rate of a mobile station UE, or the like.<br>
In step S1005, when the control channel connection setup is completed, the mobile station UE transmits a control channel connection setup response for notifying the fact, to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step S1006, various parameters for E-DPCH (for example, a transmission wave amplitude ratio in each transmission format, or the like) are communicated between the radio network controller RNC and the radio base station Node B, and a channel connection for user data is set*<br>
In step S1007, various parameters for E-DPCH (for example. a transmission wave amplitude ratio in each transmission format, or the like) are communicated between the radio network controller RNC and the mobile station UE, and a channel connection for user data is set.<br>
In step S1008, the communication between the radio<br><br>
network controller RNC and the mobile station UE is performed using the set channel connection for user data (for example, th’e E-DPDCH).<br>
During the communication of the parameters in step S1006, the radio network controller RNC notifies an effective period to an AGCH per Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) to the radio base station Node B.<br>
Then, the radio base station Node B transmits the AGCH per Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) based on the notified effective period.<br>
Further, during the communication of the parameters in step S1007, the radio network controller RNC allocates one or plurality of Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) to the mobile station UE, and at the same time, notifies the effective period to the AGCH per Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI).<br>
Furthermore, the mobile station UE determines the transmission rate of uplink user data based on the effective period which Is included in the AGCH, when receiving the AGCH per Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) from the radio base station Node B.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the aspect of allocating the Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) to each mobile station UE#A to UE#B.<br>
Here, the Radio Network Temporary Identity for mobile station individual transmission rate control “RNTI#1=A” and the Radio Network Temporary Identity for cell common transmission rate control *RNTI#2«C0MM0N” are allocated to the mobile station UE#A, and the Radio Network Temporary Identity for mobile station individual transmission rate control *RNTI#1=B” and the Radio Network Temporary Identity for cell common<br><br>
transmission rate control “RNTI#2=C0MMON’r are allocated to the mobile station UE#B.<br>
FIG. 13 shows one example for transmission pattern of AGCH transmitted by the radio base station Node B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, the effective period (time width #1) to’ the Radio Network Temporary Identity for mobile station individual transmission rate control “RNTI#1” becomes shorter.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, it is possible to increase the transmitting efficiency (throughput) in uplink by allocating the opportunity for the transmission to each mobile station UE at frequent intervals.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 13, the effective period (time width #2) to the Radio Network Temporary Identity for cell common transmission rate control *RNTI#2” becomes longer.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, it is possible to decrease the radio capacity in the downlink by decreasing the transmitting frequency.<br>
(Effects of Mobile Communication System According to First Embodiment of the Present Invention)<br>
The present invention can provide a transmission rate control method, a mobile station and a radio base station, which can set optimal effective period to an Absolute Grant Channel per a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) for a cell common transmission rate control which is common between cells and a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) for a mobile station individual transmission rate control which is individualized per mobile station UE, increase a transmitting efficiency in<br><br>
uplink, and increase radio capacity in downlink.<br>
Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and the representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
