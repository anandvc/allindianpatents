				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method of constructing a<br>
reinfored structural element, and a reinforced structural<br>
element produced thereby and more particularly to a<br>
reinforced concrete structural element having improved<br>
resistance to shear failure and to a method of providing<br>
shear reinforcement for a reinforced concrete structural<br>
element.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Thin reinforced concrete elements, for example flat<br>
concrete slabs, provide an elegant form of construction,<br>
which simplifies and speeds up site operations, allows easy<br>
and flexible partitioning of space and reduces the overall<br>
height of buildings. Reinforced concrete flat slab<br>
construction also provides large uninterrupted floor areas<br>
within a minimum construction depth, and is used extensively<br>
for a wide range of buildings such as office blocks,<br>
warehouses and car parks.<br>
One design problem associated with this form of<br>
construction is punching failure, which occurs as a result of<br>
high point loads or high shear stresses around the supporting<br>
columns. In punching failure, the failed surface of the slab<br>
forms a truncated cone or pyramid. This problem has in the<br>
past often lead to the use of mushroom heads or local<br>
thickening of the slab, but these solutions increase costs<br>
and slow down the rate of construction.As the spans become<br>
larger and the slabs become thinner the increased stresses<br>
around the critical shear perimeter have created even greater<br><br>
problems for the structural engineer. A variety of design<br>
solutions have been proposed, of which the mast commonly used<br>
are as follows:<br>
1.	Conventional shear reinforcement<br>
This solution is very labour-intensive and requires<br>
extra work both in the design and on site.<br>
2.	Use of a larger column and/or a thicker conerets slab<br>
These solutions increase the deadload of the<br>
building and reduce the available space.<br>
3 . Use of a column head<br>
This requires more complicated formwork, slows down<br>
the rate of construction, and interferes with the<br>
installation of building services.<br>
4. Use of slab drops<br>
These are a modified form of column head.<br>
Shear reinforcement, when required, is normally<br>
accomplished by providing reinforcing members either at an<br>
angle or laterally to the main flexural reinforcement. In<br>
thin structural elements, such as flat slabs, anchoring of<br>
short lengths of shear reinforcement is a major design<br>
problem. The problem is aggravated by the fact that normal<br>
shear reinforcement cannot be placed above the top layer of<br>
flexural reinforcement without reducing either the<br>
durability, or the efficiency, of the flexural reinforcement.<br>
In addition, there is the practical problem of supporting the<br>
shear reinforcement during the construction stages.<br><br>
Recently a new system has been introduced by Square Grip<br>
Limited, designated the Shearhoop system, which consists of<br>
an assembly of specially shaped links (shear leg bobs) and<br>
hoop reinforcing bars. The hoops are available in a range of<br>
sizes and can be combined to form a complete system<br>
extending outwards from the column to the zone where the<br>
shear resistance of the concrete slab alone is adequate.<br>
In the construction of a slab using Shearhoops, bars B1,<br>
B2 for the bottom layer of reinforcement are first laid down<br>
and the Shearhoops placed over them in the appropriate<br>
location. Top reinforcement T2 is then positioned on chairs<br>
and the bars overlapping the Shearhoops fully located under<br>
the ends of the shear leg bobs extending from the Shearhoops.<br>
Finally the top reinforcement T1 is placed over the entire<br>
structure.<br>
Whilst the Shearhoops are an improvement on previous<br>
arrangements, they still cannot be anchored above the top<br>
layer of reinforcement T1 and thus do not provide the best<br>
possible shear reinforcement.<br>
From the above, it is apparent that, although much<br>
effort has gone into the design of reinforcing systems that<br>
address some of the above mentioned problems, none of them<br>
provide a complete solution. Although prepackaged reinforced<br>
systems offer some time savings over the in-situ steel fixing<br>
solutions, they are nevertheless more expensive in terms of<br>
materials and other resources, such as labour and crane time.<br>
Sxane of the other prior art proposals are also of<br><br>
questionable effectiveness, or produce an unquantifiable<br>
increase in flexural capacity.<br>
There is a need, therefore, for an improved reinforcing<br>
system to impart better shear resistance, without increasing<br>
the thickness of the slab. An additional advantage would be<br>
to provide a shear reinforcement system enabling thinner<br>
slabs to be used.<br>
US 4854106 described foundations for buildings and like .<br>
structures employing steel reinforcement. A hook leg has an<br>
elongate member bifurcated at each end longitudinally of the<br>
member to form a pair of extensions with a slot therebetween,<br>
the distal portion of the extensions being bent into a curved<br>
form extending transversely of the member to form hooks<br>
adapted to resiliently engage a pair of reinforcing rods in<br>
the reinforcement, the slots in the unbent portions of the<br>
extensions being adapted to receive a second pair of<br>
reinforcing rods extending transversely of the first pair,<br>
whereby to fix the rods in spaced alignment. There is no<br>
mention of shear reinforcement.<br>
US 4472331 described a reinforcing framework for a<br>
concrete building structure in which column and beam<br>
reinforcing bars are inserted into holes in reinforcement<br>
frames disposed at predetermined intervals. Shearing<br>
reinforcement bands, formed by bending a steel strip into a<br>
rectangular frame shape, are disposed between adjacent<br>
reinforcement frames and secured to wooden sheathing boards<br>
by nailS. The construction requires access to all sides of<br><br>
the column or beam, and the protruding nails would give rise<br>
to potential corrosion problems.<br>
DE 3331276 describes shear reinforcement elements for<br>
column supported flat slabs or beams of reinforced or<br>
prestressed concrete, which consist of flat steel strips<br>
which are undulating in at least two dimensions and<br>
transverse to the main surface of the flat slab or beams.<br>
The shear reinforcement elements are used in place of<br>
conventional round reinforcing bars.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a shear failure<br>
reinforcing system for structural elements, in which thin<br>
elongate strips of high stiffness material are anchored<br>
around a layer of conventional reinforcement, and/or are<br>
anchored around a plurality of layers of conventional<br>
reinforcement, such that the strips tie the structural<br>
element and improve its resistance to shear failure. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the strips are enchored around the<br>
outermost reinforcing members of a layer or layers of<br>
reinforcement, to give improved shear resistance.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of<br>
constructing a reinforced structural element, said element<br>
being, in use, potentially subject to concentrated forces in<br>
a first direction, said forces resulting in shear stresses in<br>
the element, said method comprising :<br>

engagement of said peak with an element thereof;<br>
and<br>
d)	casting structural material around said first and<br>

strips to embed said structures and strips in said<br>
material;<br>
characterised in that the method further comprises :-<br>
e)	disposing said strips in the first and second<br>
reinforcing structures from a direction opposite<br>
said first direction and from one side of said<br>
first reinforcing structure;<br>

reinforcing structure so as to lie adjacent said<br>
second reinforcing structure; and<br>

being arranged to provide shear reinforcement for<br>
the structural element in the event of the clement<br><br>
being subject to such concentrated shear-resulting<br>
forces in said first direction.<br>
This invention also provides a reinforced structural<br>
element produced by the above method, said element being, in<br>
use, potentially subject to concentrated forces in a first<br>
direction, said forces resulting in shear in the structural<br>
element, said structural element comprising :<br>

the structural element in the event of the element<br>
being subject to such concentrated shear-resulting<br>
forces in said first direction.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THB INVENTION<br>
The reinforced structural element may be cast in situ or<br>
precast, and may be provided with any suitable longitudinal<br>
reinforcement comprising elongate reinforcing members, which<br>
may be initially unstressed, pre-stressed, or post-tensioned.<br>
The invention finds particular application where the<br>
reinforced structural element is a slab structure especially<br>
a flat slab, although it can also be a waffle or ribbed slab,<br>
a slab with downstands, a foundation slab Or footing, or a<br>
staircase slab Other possible uses may be in a wall, a wide<br>
band beam, or normal beam, a normal or extended column, a box<br>
or other hollow shape, or a shell or other three dimensional<br>
shape. The element may be with or without openings, as<br>
desired. The reinforced structural element may have<br>
any suitable thickness, depending upon the application.<br>
Henceforth the invention will be more particularly described<br>
with reference to thin reinforced concrete structural<br>
elements, for example flat slabs, having a thickness of from<br><br>
10 to 80cms, more particularly from 10 to 30cms, but it is to<br>
be understood that although the invention has particular<br>
advantages when applied to such structures, it is not limited<br>
thereto.<br>
The thin reinforced concrete structural element may have<br>
any desired length and width, but reinforced flat slabs used<br>
in conventional building construction are often of a size of<br>
from 1 to 10 metres in length and from 1 to 10 metres in<br>
width.<br>
The reinforcing members will usually be elongate rods or<br>
bars embedded in the structural element and lying parallel to<br>
the major surfaces of the element. The reinforcing members<br>
can have any suitable cross-section, for example round,<br>
square, or rectangular. Typically, the reinforcing members<br>
lie adjacent one or more of the major surfaces of the<br>
structural element, and comprise series of reinforcing bars<br>
laid at right angles to each other.<br>
The major surfaces of the structural element will<br>
normally be the top and bottom surfaces, where the element is<br>
a slab, but they could also be the side surfaces of a wall.<br>
The material of the reinforced concrete structural<br>
element may be normal concrete, high strength concrete, light<br>
weight concrete, concrete with special cements and<br>
aggregates, polymer modified concrete, special cement mortar,<br>
special polymer mortar. Elements formed from other suitable<br>
materials able to be cast which require strengthening in<br>
shear, such as, for example, fibre reinforced plastics and<br><br>
ceremics can also be used.<br>
The thin elongate strip of high stiffness material<br>
preferably has dimensions such that it will not radically<br>
change the overall thickness of the structural members to<br>
which it is anchored, and such that it will not break when<br>
bent to the required shape, which could be around tight<br>
corners. Preferably the strip has a thickness of from 0.5 to<br>
1.0mm and a width of from 10 to 30mm. The material of the<br>
strip is preferably a high tensile, high stiffness material,<br>
such as, for example, high tensile steel, although other high<br>
stiffness materials, for example structural polymers such as<br>
polypropylene and fibre reinforced plastics comprising, for<br>
example, carbon fibre, glass fibre and aramids, are not<br>
excluded. The material is required to have high stiffness in<br>
order to be able to arrest the development of shear cracks at<br>
low strains, and, for example, a material of stiffness of<br>
from 100KN/mm2 to 210KN/mm2 is preferred. High strength<br>
material is preferred for the strips because a lower volume<br>
of strip material can be used. A typical strength for a high<br>
tensile steel used for the strip can be, for example, from<br>
460N/mm2 to 1500N/mm2. Special hardness strips may be useful<br>
when dealing with walls in safe areas.<br>
The durability of the strip may be improved by adequate<br>
cover, by special surface protection, or by using non-<br>
corrosive materials such as stainless steel, or fibre<br>
reinforced plastics. Where the strip is metallic, it may also<br>
be eharged to provide cathodic protection.<br><br>
Punched holes, embossments and indentations in the<br>
strip, as well as spedial bending, twisting or surface<br>
treatment of the strip, can help the overall bond<br>
characteristics of the strip to the material of the<br>
structural element, although a right angle bend may be<br>
sufficient to anchor the strip where concrete is used as the<br>
material for the reinforced structural element.<br>
In use, the strip may be disposed in a vertical,<br>
horizontal, or inclined direction, and may be bent or clipped<br>
around the reinforcing member to which it is anchored, or<br>
tied thereto. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the<br>
strip is anchored around one or more of the outermost<br>
reinforcing members, that is, those members closest to the<br>
major surfaces of the structural element. Since the<br>
reinforcing bars are often of significant thickness, for<br>
example around 20mm diameter, this provides shear<br>
reinforcement to a point closer to the surface than has been<br>
possible hitherto.<br>
Bending and shaping of the strips to the desired shape<br>
may be readily accomplished by hand, or by the use of<br>
specialised automated or semi-automated equipment, the strips<br>
may be preformed before conveying to the site, and use, if<br>
desired.<br>
The strips may be anchored in the material of the<br>
structural element by providing an appropriate extra strip<br>
length beyond a bend around a structural element, or<br>
alternatively ends of the strip may be secured together by<br><br>
metal clips, rivets or other fixing means. It is particularly<br>
pref erred for the strip to be so shaped that it can be<br>
positioned from one side of the structural element, without<br>
the need to obtain all round access. The strip can, for<br>
example, be bent into a zigzag shape, a castellated shape, a<br>
sine wave curved shape, or other repeating straight sided or<br>
curved shaped and then dropped into position on the<br>
reinforcing members. This greatly facilitates assembly, where<br>
it is often difficult to obtain all round accesss to the<br>
structural element.<br>
Preferably the strips are arranged such that they are<br>
totally enclosed within and not exposed at. any point on the<br>
surface of the structural element, and are not connected to<br>
any metal fixing, for example, a nail or screw, which is<br>
exposed on the structural element surface. This is to avoid<br>
the risk of corrosion or deterioration of the strips in<br>
service.<br>
Structural elements reinforced by the method of the<br>
invention can have improved strength and substantially<br>
improved ductility, imparting improved resistance to shear<br>
failure. In addition, structural elements reinforced in<br>
accordance with the invention can have a thinner section than<br>
those hitherto specified because of their improved resistance<br>
to shear failure.<br>

The invention will now be illustrated, by the following<br>
examples :<br>
Example 1<br>
This example describeds the enhancement of shear<br>
capacity of a flat slab with inclined metal strip<br>
reinforcement having punched holes.<br>
Steel strips are produced having a series of punched<br>
holes as shown in figure 2, and are preformed to the<br>
castellated shape shown therein. The strips are arranged in<br>
the formwork for a concrete slab in locations determined by<br>
using British Standard BS8110 (1985), as illustrated in<br>
figure 3A. It will be noted that it is only necessary to have<br>
access to the top side of the formwork in order to place the<br>
strips in position. Concrete is then poured to produce a slab<br>
of thichness 175mm which is below the 200mm limit imposed by<br>
BS8110 on the thickness of flat slabs.<br>
The slab (B) was tested with an eight-point load<br>
arrangement, simulating loading typical of flat slabs in<br>
buildings of conventional construction. The load versus<br>
deflection curves and the load versus strain in the flexural<br>
reinforcement curves for this slab and others tested for<br>
comparison are shown in figures 4A and 4B respectively.<br>
Slab (A) was unreinforced and failed in abrupt punching<br>
shear mode at a load of 460kN. Slab (B) deflected<br>
considerably more, developed very large strains in the<br>
longitudinal reinforcement and failed in a ductile mode at a<br>
maximum load of 560kN in the fashion desired in practirce by<br><br>
structural engineers.<br>
Example 2<br>
-This example demonstrates the increase in load and<br>
ductility of a flat slab reinforced with inclined steel<br>
strip.<br>
Steel strips without the punched holes are preformed as<br>
shown in figure 2 and arranged in the metal formwork for a<br>
concrete slab in locations determined by using BS8110 (1985)<br>
as illustrated in figure 3B. Concrete is then poured to<br>
produce a slab of thichness 175mm.<br>
The slab (C) was tested with an eight-point load<br>
arrangement, making extra allowance for anchoring the strip<br>
at its ends. The load versus deflection curves and the load<br>
versus strain in the flexural reinforcement curves for this<br>
slab and others tested for comparison are shown in figures 4A<br>
and 4B respectively.<br>
Slab (C) deflected considerably more than slab (A), and<br>
developed very large strains in the longitudinal<br>
reinforcement, failing in' a ductile mode at a maximum load of<br>
560kN.<br>
Example 3.<br>
This example demonstrates the increase in load and<br>
ductility of a flat slab reinforced with vertical steel strip<br>
reinforcement anchoring both layers of longitudinal<br>
reinforcement.<br>
Steel strips, punched and pre-formed as shown in figure<br>
2, are inserfed into the form form work of a concrete slab as<br><br>
shown in figure 3C and anchored to the upper and lower layers<br>
of longitudinal reinforcing bars. The strips are arranged in<br>
locations determined by using BS8110 (1985 ). Concrete is then<br>
poured to produce a slab of thickness 175mm.<br>
The slab (D) was tested with an eight-point load<br>
arrangement, simulating loading typical on flat slabs in<br>
buildings. Extra allowance was made for anchoring the strip<br>
at its ends. The load versus deflection curves and the load<br>
versus strain in the fiexural reinforcement curves for this<br>
slab and others tested for comparison is shown in figures 4A<br>
and 4B respectively.<br>
Slab (D) deflecting considerably more than slab (A) ,<br>
developed very large strains in the longitudinal<br>
reinforcement, and failed in a ductile mode at a maximum load<br>
of 560kN.<br>
