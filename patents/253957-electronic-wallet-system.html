				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to electronics wallets for<br>
performing electronic commercial transactions on open networks such as<br>
internet, and more particularly to a new electronic wallet architecture and to<br>
methods for transferring tokens (or electronic money units) between electronics<br>
wallets.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Nowadays, a large part of customers often use credit card to make<br>
purchase. With this kind of payment system, the cardholder can prove his<br>
identity thanks to the knowledge of a secret PIN (Personal Identification<br>
Number) stored in the card and, if it is not sufficient, thanks to identification<br>
papers located in his wallet.<br>
With the advent of electronic commerce (or e-commerce), all<br>
schemes executed every days by customers and merchants can be repeated in<br>
the electronic world with few modifications and with the setup of new materials<br>
and applications.<br>
Identification papers that proves the identity of an end-entity<br>
(customer or merchant) are now replaced by digital certificates and classical<br>
wallets which are used in the real world are replaced by electronic wallets (also<br>
called E-wallets).<br>
The digital certificates are today largely used by the e-commerce<br>
community and are out of the scope of this patent application.<br>
The notion of E-wallet, as disclosed for example in "Merkow M.S.,<br>
Breithaupt J. and Wheeler K.L., "Building SET Applications for Secure<br>
Transactions", Wiley Computer Publishing, 1998" covers a computer application<br>
allowing a consumer to store private information (e.g. credit cards numbers,<br>
name, address, etc.) on his PC and to retrieve that information quickly and<br>
securely for the purpose of online shopping for example.<br>
Various E-wallet systems have been proposed recently. Some of<br>
them are dedicated to the storage of digital certificates in order to provide an<br>
easy way to make purchase via "macropayment" schemes such as SET (a<br>
standardized e-commerce protocol, information about which can be found in<br>
"Loeb L, "Secure Electronic Transactions : Introduction and Technical<br>
Reference", Artech House Publishers, 1998"). Among these products are the<br>
IBM Consumer Wallet™ (information about it can be found in the internet<br>
publication "http://www-4ibm.com/.software/commerce/payment/wallet.html") or<br><br>
the GlobeSet Wallet™ (information about it can be found in the internet publication<br>
http://www.alobeset.com/Products/Wallet/wallet.shtml). <page>.<br>
Other systems manage digital coins, or tokens, to make "micropayment" transactions, for<br>
example to purchase to purchase low value items; while others manage several kinds of data<br>
(digital certificates as well as digital coins).<br>
However, if we compare the features offered by the current E-wallets to those satisfied<br>
by the wallets used in the real world, we can see that a typical wallet proposes more functionality<br>
since we can also exchange money from one wallet to another, store tickets, invoices, pictures,<br>
etc.<br>
In addition, all current e-commerce protocols need the user's bank account to make<br>
purchase and thus, children are left outside of e-commerce activities.<br>
The present invention is therefore directed to the problem of developing a new electronic<br>
wallet which provides more functionality than existing electronic wallets and which is more<br>
"family-oriented". Particularly, it should allow children to participate to e-commerce by having<br>
their own purse for micropayment transactions and it should allow the same operations as "real-<br>
life" wallets (storage of tokens, token transfer facilities between purses, etc.).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves this problem by providing an electronic wallet system<br>
comprising n devices capable of conducting electronic business transaction on an open network<br>
and containing a smart card reader, wherein n is superior or equal to 1, and a plurality of smart<br>
cards representing electronic purses able to contain tokens. The devices are interconnected<br>
through a local network and one of said devices comprises an entity, called the server, which<br>
contains a list of data entries, each entry corresponding to a purse liable to receive tokens from<br>
other purses of the system.<br>
The devices are preferably set-top boxes but in another embodiment of the invention,<br>
the devices may be computers or workstations.<br>
The tokens transferred between purses are stored temporally by the server.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, tokens are transferred from one<br>
first purse to a second purse in two stages : the tokens assigned to the second purse are<br>
deposited with the server from the first purse during the first stage, and the tokens are credited<br>
to the second purse from the server during the second stage. Advantageously, the operations<br>
executed<br><br>
The patent application WO 97104609 discloses a system for payment<br>
transactions between two cards, each card having a resident account and being<br>
inserted in one Mobile Station unit (e.g. telephone) connected to a<br>
telecommunication network. A computer system to which mobile stations can be<br>
connected handles accounts corresponding to the resident accounts of the cards.<br>
The document does not address the issue of a "family-oriented" electronic wallet.<br><br>
during the first stage and the operations executed during the second stage are<br>
performed in two different times.<br>
According to a further aspect of this embodiment, tokens transferred<br>
from one first purse to a second purse are decrement from said first purse when<br>
the transfer is registered by the server and are incremented on said second<br>
purse when the smart card corresponding to said second purse is inserted in a<br>
smart card reader of one device.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, each of said device<br>
further comprises an entity, called the client and the operations executed during<br>
each of said first stage or second stage may be performed from anyone of said<br>
clients.<br>
Thanks to the invention, it is possible to transfer tokens to another<br>
purse (registered on the server) without having in hands the corresponding<br>
smart card. One advantage of this new electronic wallet system is that it is<br>
family-oriented. Each member of the family, including children, can have his/her<br>
own purse and use it to make electronic purchases.<br>
With the new feature of the invention, children can now participate to<br>
electronic financial operations by making purchase of low value items through<br>
micropayment transactions by using their personal purse.<br>
The new electronic wallet system replaces, among others, the pocket<br>
money currently used in the real world. Therefore, when one of the parents<br>
wants to give money to a child, he/she first has to charge his/her purse with<br>
tokens via a classical macropayment transaction (for instance SET) which<br>
needs a bank account number. Then, he/she only has to perform an inter-purse<br>
operation to transfer a certain amount of tokens from his/her own purse towards<br>
the purse of his/her child.<br>
Thanks to the fact that the inter-purse transfer of tokens is managed<br>
by the server, the parents do not need to have the smart card representing the<br>
purses of their children to charge them with tokens.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for registering a purse in the<br>
server of a system as the above-mentioned one. This process comprises the<br>
steps consisting for a device, preferably the device containing the server, in :<br>
-	receiving a specific smart card, called the root card ;<br>
-	receiving a personal identification number entered by a user on said<br>
device;<br>
-	verifying that said entered personal identification number matches a<br>
personal identification number stored in said root card ; and, should verification<br>
be positive :<br><br>
-	receiving a smart card corresponding to the purse to be registered,<br>
said smart card containing a purse identifier ;and<br>
-	storing said purse identifier in the list of data entries contained in<br>
said server.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a smart card purse transaction identifier is<br>
stored in the smart card corresponding to the registered purse and is initialized<br>
to zero and a server purse transaction identifier is stored in the data entry<br>
corresponding to the registered purse in the server and is initialized to zero.<br>
The invention further concerns a process for depositing tokens from<br>
a first purse for a second purse in an electronic wallet system as the above-<br>
mentioned one. This process comprises the steps consisting, for a device<br>
containing a client entity, in :<br>
a)	receiving a first smart card corresponding to the first purse ;<br>
b)	sending a first message to the server to request a token deposit;<br>
c)	receiving from the server a list of purses liable to receive tokens ;<br>
and<br>
d)	sending a second message containing an amount of tokens and a<br>
purse identifier corresponding to the second purse to deposit the amount of<br>
tokens with the server for the second purse.<br>
Another similar process according to the invention comprises the<br>
steps consisting, for a device containing the server, in :<br>
i) receiving from a client a first message requesting a token deposit;<br>
j) sending to the client a list of purses liable to receive tokens ;<br>
k) receiving from the client a second message containing an amount<br>
of tokens and a purse identifier corresponding to the second purse ; and<br>
I) storing the amount of tokens in the data entry corresponding to the<br>
second purse.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for receiving tokens in a<br>
second purse in an electronic wallet system as the above-mentioned one. This<br>
process comprises the steps consisting, for a device containing a client entity,<br>
in:<br>
m) receiving a smart card corresponding to the second purse ;<br>
n) sending a fourth message to the server to request the receipt of<br>
tokens deposited with the server for the second purse ;<br>
o) receiving a fifth message containing a number N of actions stored<br>
by the server in the data entry corresponding to the second purse, each action<br>
containing an amount of tokens received from one purse of the electronic wallet<br>
system; and<br><br>
p) for each action i between 1 to N :<br>
p1) sending a sixth message to the server to request the next<br>
action i;<br>
p2) receiving a seventh message from the server containing<br>
the action i; and<br>
p3) storing in the smart card corresponding to the second<br>
purse the amount of tokens contained in the action i.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, this process further<br>
comprises the steps consisting :<br>
-	for the device containing a client, in concatenating the smart card<br>
purse transaction identifier corresponding to the second purse to said sixth<br>
message sent at step p1);<br>
-	for the device containing the server:<br>
in verifying that the smart card purse transaction identifier<br>
equals the server purse transaction identifier stored in the server in the second<br>
purse data entry and, should verification be positive :<br>
in incrementing the server purse transaction identifier stored<br>
in the server, and<br>
in concatenating said incremented server purse transaction<br>
identifier to the seventh message ; and<br>
-	for the device containing a client, in verifying that the server purse<br>
transaction identifier received at step p2) in the seventh message equals the<br>
smart card purse transaction identifier minus one, and should verification be<br>
positive, in performing step p3).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the general architecture of an electronic wallet<br>
system according to the invention which corresponds to the configuration of the<br>
system in a family.<br>
As it can be seen on this figure, this typical electronic wallet system<br>
contains three entities:<br>
-	a first entity 1 called the server which is connected to an open<br>
network 40 (for example internet). This entity is responsible of the inter-purses<br>
operations, as will be explained in more details bellow, and the storage of digital<br>
certificates, invoices, etc. for the members of the family ;<br>
-	a set of k second entities 21 to 2k called clients which are also<br>
connected to an open network (e.g. Internet). Moreover, each of these clients is<br>
also connected to the server via a local home network;<br>
-	a set of p smart cards 31 to 3p, the third entities (where p is the<br>
number of persons in the family) which implement the purses. Thus, each<br>
member of the family possesses his own purse represented by a smart card.<br>
From these different entities, each member of the family should be<br>
able to participate to secured e-commerce activities. In fact, a smart card<br>
provides to the user an efficient and secure way to store all personal and<br>
sensitive data such as private keys, digital tokens, authentication data, etc.<br>
An example of hardware implementation of this architecture is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2. The entities "Server" and "Clients" are implemented, in a<br><br>
preferred embodiment, by software applications running in devices such as set-<br>
top boxes, computers, game stations, portable phones or any other home<br>
equipment.<br>
In the example of Fig. 2, a first set-top box 10 contains the server<br>
application 101 and one Client application 121. This first set-top box is for<br>
example located in the living-room of the family house. A second set-top box<br>
11, located in another room of the house, contains another Client2 application<br>
122, while two other devices, a game station 12 and a computer 13, located in<br>
children bedrooms for example, contain respectively Client3 application 123 and<br>
Client* application 124. The devices are equipped with smart card readers 130<br>
- 133 and are all connected to a home network 250, which may be an IEEE<br>
1394 wire or wireless network. This home network 250 provides a connection to<br>
an open network 140 for all the devices 10-13.<br>
All the applications 101, 121 - 124 use some resources of the<br>
devices to access to the smart card readers 130-133 and to the local and / or<br>
open network.<br>
In order to simplify the further discussion, the terms "server" and<br>
"client" will be used hereafter to refer either to the application itself or to the<br>
device containing the application, with the exception that the device referred to<br>
as "server" also contains a client application.<br>
Thus, when the user wants to perform electronic financial operations<br>
(electronic commerce, token purchase, purse-to-purse token transfer...), he has<br>
to insert his smart card in the smart card reader of a client (here, the device)<br>
that contains all needed software in order to perform all of these activities<br>
(macropayment protocols, micropayment protocols, etc.).<br>
It should be noted that the server is also capable of performing<br>
electronic financial and business operations because it also contains a client<br>
and that, in an extreme solution, the electronic wallet system contains only one<br>
device containing the server application and one client application.<br>
Contrary to classical financial operations (e-commerce, token<br>
purchase, etc.), the inter-purses operations need the participation of the server.<br>
All needed information used to make these inter-purses operations are<br>
centralized in the server which is connected to all clients via a local home<br>
network (250 in Fig. 2).<br>
Indeed, when a user A wants to deposit x tokens on a purse PB of a<br>
user B, the electronic wallet system, and more precisely the server, will keep a<br>
trace of the transaction in order to charge the purse PB with x token at its next<br>
use. Advantageously, this functionality is possible even if the client in which the<br><br>
purse PB is inserted is not the same as the one used by the user A to make the<br>
token transfer.<br>
To this end, the server contains a list of all registered purses<br>
representing the purses which can receive tokens from other purses. It also<br>
contains, for each registered purse, a list of "actions" to execute at the next use<br>
of the purse. An "action" represents the fact that a number of tokens x has been<br>
transferred from a purse PY to the registered purse.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of the server's content. On Fig. 3, three<br>
purses PA, PB and Pc are registered in the server. The process for registering a<br>
purse in the server will be explained bellow.<br>
As for purse PA, no action has been stored meaning that no token<br>
has been transferred to purse PA from another purse. As for purse PB, an action<br>
A1, denoted by (10,Px) (meaning that purse PB has received 10 tokens from<br>
purse Px), is stored and will be executed at the next use of purse PB as<br>
explained bellow.<br>
As for purse Pc, actions A2 (20 tokens received from purse PA to<br>
purse Pc) and A3 (1 token received from purse PY to purse Pc) will be executed<br>
at the next use of Pc.<br>
We will now describe two processes involved in the inter-purse<br>
transfer of tokens. The first one is called "token deposit" and designates the<br>
process executed when a user A wants to transfer tokens from his own purse<br>
towards a registered purse of a user B. The second one is called "token receipt"<br>
and designates the reverse process which is executed when the user B inserts<br>
his smart card in a client.<br>
It is important to note that a user who whishes to receive tokens from<br>
other people must make his purse registered on the server whereas a user who<br>
only wants to transfer tokens from his purse to other purses does not need to<br>
register his purse on the server.<br>
We will first describe the process of "token deposit" in view of Fig. 4.<br>
When a user A who owns a purse PA desires to transfer tokens to<br>
another purse, the user A has first to insert his smart card corresponding to<br>
purse PA in a client and to chose, via the user interface of the client, the<br>
application for transferring tokens to another purse. Then, the client on which<br>
the user A is connected sends a request to the server (message<br>
"AskTokenDepositO" sent at step 50 - Fig. 4) and the server sends back in<br>
response the list of all registered purses (designating those which can receive<br>
tokens) in a message "ListPurses(m,purser1, .... pursem)" (step 51). "m"<br><br>
designates the number of registered purses and "purse1 ..., pursem" designate<br>
the different purse identifiers of the list.<br>
Once the client receives this list, it displays it to the user A who can<br>
choose the recipient Px of the token transfer and the amount of tokens to be<br>
transferred. Next, the client sends to the server a message "Deposit(amount,<br>
purse_recipient, purse_sender)" (at step 52) wherein "amount' corresponds to<br>
the number of tokens to transfer, "purse_recipient" is the recipient's purse<br>
identifier (here, it corresponds to Px) and "purse_sender" is an information<br>
about the sender of the tokens. Advantageously this information will be the<br>
sender's purse identifier PA or the name of user A. When the server receives<br>
this message, it adds an action Ai=(amount,PA) in the list of actions memorized<br>
for purse Px.<br>
We will now describe the "token receipt" process in view of Fig. 5.<br>
This process is executed each time a user X inserts his smart card in<br>
a client. It is used to contact the server in order to execute all actions stored in<br>
the server to credit the purse Px owned by the user X. Of course, this process<br>
may be executed from any client, no matter in which client the first process of<br>
"token deposit" has been executed.<br>
In a first step 60, a message "GetNumberOfActions(purse_id)",<br>
where "purse_id" is the identifier of the purse Px, is sent by the client to the<br>
server. In response to this request, the server retrieves the entries in the list of<br>
actions corresponding to the purse_id and return the size of the list of actions<br>
attached to this purse (Px in the present example) in a message<br>
"NumberOfActions(N,purse_id)" sent to the client at step 61. "N" represents the<br>
number of actions memorized for purse Px to be executed and "pursejd' is<br>
copied from the message "GetNumberOfActions(purse_id)". Then, the client<br>
verifies that the pursejd is the same that was sent in the<br>
"GetNumberOfActions(purse_id)" message and stores the number N of actions<br>
to execute.<br>
Then, for each action i from 1 to N stored in the server for purse Px,<br>
the two following messages will be exchanged at steps 62, 63 to 62', 63". The<br>
first message "GetNextActioni(purse_id)" is sent by the client to the server with<br>
"purse_id' being the identifier of the purse Px. On receipt of this message, the<br>
server copies the first action of the list attached to the purse Px (c.f. Fig. 3) and<br>
clears this action. Then, it sends the second message<br>
"Actioni(purse_id,Action)", where "pursejd' is the identifier of purse Px and<br>
"Action" is the action to execute (for example: 10 tokens received from purse PA<br>
to purse Px), to the client. When the client receives this second message, it<br><br>
executes the action to charge purse Px with the number of tokens indicated in<br>
"Action".<br>
Security issues<br>
Before participating in e-commerce activities as well as inter-purses<br>
operations with the electronic wallet system of the invention, the user must be<br>
sure that the system cannot be easily attacked and for this purpose, solutions<br>
providing a sufficient level of security have to be proposed.<br>
First of all, the system must be able to authenticate a user when<br>
he/she enters his/her smart card in a client. This feature avoids the use of a<br>
smart card by another user than the owner of the card. Moreover, the smart<br>
card must also be authenticated in order to ensure that the used card has really<br>
been provided by the electronic wallet system manufacturer.<br>
Then, as mentioned previously, a purse must be registered on the<br>
server before it can receive tokens from another purse. However, it is necessary<br>
to ensure that this registration phase cannot be executed by anybody since in<br>
this case, an intruder can register his own purse and route all token transfer<br>
messages (messages "Desposit(amount,purse_recipient,purse_sender)" and<br>
"Actioni(purse_id,Action)") towards his purse. In fact, only the members of one<br>
family should be able to have their purses registered on the server.<br>
In addition, some messages exchanged between a client and the<br>
server (during "token deposit" and "token receipt" process - Fig. 4 and 5) have<br>
to be protected to ensure that the amount of transfer as well as the recipient<br>
purse cannot be modified by a fraudulent user during transmission.<br>
Moreover, messages between the client and the smart card<br>
representing the purse, and dedicated to credit or debit tokens should be<br>
protected to avoid replay attacks by fraudulent users. A replay attack consists in<br>
sending several time a message, for example a message containing an action<br>
to credit the purse.<br>
We will now describe the security features which are provided to the<br>
electronic wallet system of the invention.<br>
First of all, we suppose that each system contains a shared secret<br>
key denoted by DFW_SK, which is provided by the system manufacturer and<br>
which is stored in a secure fashion on each entity of the electronic wallet system<br>
(clients, server and smart cards).<br>
1. User and smart card authentication<br>
This functionality aims at:	<br><br>
(i) authenticating a purse/smart card holder to be the legitimate<br>
owner of the purse so that if the purse/smart card is lost or stolen, it cannot be<br>
used by others to make purchase;<br>
(ii) authenticating that the used smart card has been provided by the<br>
electronic wallet system manufacturer so that if an intruder makes his own card,<br>
it will be immediately detected.<br>
The proposed solution needs the communication between the smart<br>
card and the client in which the card is inserted, and does not involve the server<br>
as will be explained below in view of Fig. 6 and 7.<br>
Fig. 6 represents a client 2 (such as entities 21, 22 to 2k in Fig. 1) in<br>
which a smart card 3 is inserted. In fact, as explained previously in view of Fig.<br>
2, the smart is inserted in the smart card reader of a device containing the client<br>
application.<br>
The communication between the smart card and the client is<br>
performed via a software 125 called Wallet Manager that runs on each client<br>
and that allows interfacing the user (through the user interface software 126)<br>
and the smart card.<br>
Each member of the family possesses a unique PIN (Personal<br>
Identification Number) which is kept secret from others and which is linked to<br>
his/her purse. The hashing H(PIN) (where H is a one-way function) of this PIN is<br>
stored in the purse of the user.<br>
Therefore, when the user inserts his/her card in a client to perform<br>
financial operations, he/she first has to enter his/her PIN. This entered PIN is<br>
then sent to the Wallet Manager that computes H(entered PIN).<br>
Now, the retained solution to provide authentication is based on a<br>
mutual authentication process which uses a challenge-response based on<br>
symmetric-key encryption algorithms, more details about which can be found in<br>
""Handbook of Applied Cryptograph/, Menezes A., Van Oorschot P.C and<br>
Vanstone S.A., CRC Press, 1997".<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the exchanged messages during this authentication<br>
process.<br>
During the first step 70, the client asks for a challenge to the card by<br>
sending a message "GetChallenge". The smart card responds by sending a first<br>
challenge denoted by "C1" at step 71. A challenge is a random number which is<br>
different at each new authentication process and which is used to prevent a<br>
"replay attack".<br>
 From this challenge C1 received from the smart card, the client forms<br>
a message M by concatenating the challenge C1, a new challenge generated in<br><br>
the client denoted by C2 and the H(entered PIN) value that is<br>
M=C1|C2|H(entered PIN). This message M is then encrypted using the shared<br>
secret key DFW_SK and the encrypted message "EDFw_sK(C1\C2\H(entered<br>
PIN))" is sent to the card at step 72.<br>
When the card receives this encrypted message, it can easily<br>
retrieve M and all of its components using the decryption process and the<br>
shared secret key DFW_SK of the electronic wallet system contained in the<br>
smart card (in this case, this will show that the smart card has been provided by<br>
the electronic wallet system manufacturer and thus ensures that aim (ii)<br>
mentioned above is achieved).<br>
The smart card then verifies that the decrypted challenge C1 matches<br>
the challenge C1 sent at step 71. If the verification succeeds, the card proceeds<br>
to the PIN verification by verifying that H(PIN)=H(entered PIN). In this case, the<br>
user is authenticated as being the legitimate owner of the purse and the<br>
process can continue.<br>
A new message M' is then created by concatenating the two<br>
challenges C2 and C1. This message is encrypted using the DFW_SK key and<br>
the encrypted message "EDFW_SK(C2\C1)" is sent back to the client at step 73.<br>
Upon reception, the client can authenticate the card by retrieving the two<br>
challenges sent in previous exchanges.<br>
2. Purse registration<br>
As mentioned previously, in order to receive tokens from other<br>
purses, a purse must be registered in the server which is responsible for inter-<br>
purses operations.<br>
So, before a user A, for example a children, can receive tokens from<br>
a user B, for example one of his/her parents, the purse of user A must be<br>
registered in the server.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, this registration phase<br>
will ensure that only members of the family can have their purse registered in<br>
the server. Of course this is not strictly limited to real members of the family and<br>
the purse registration can be extended to people "considered as" members of<br>
the family.<br>
It is therefore proposed that a given member of the family has the<br>
root rights to register the purses of all members of the family. Unlike the other<br>
members of the family, only this privileged user, called the "root user" in the<br>
following, will be authorized to execute the registration phase. In the electronic<br><br>
wallet system, the root user is considered as a "third trust party" which will<br>
ensures that all registered purses are owned by a member of the family.<br>
In order to implement this functionality, a special smart card for which<br>
the PIN has the root rights is provided by the electronic wallet system<br>
manufacturer together with the other entities of the system. This special card<br>
will be referred to as the "root card' in the following. The hashing of the root PIN<br>
H(root PIN) is stored in the server to provide the server a way to verify that the<br>
user who attempts to execute the registration phase is the root user. Moreover,<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the software for executing this registration phase is<br>
only contained in the server.<br>
Now, we will describe more precisely how this registration phase is<br>
executed. We suppose that user A is the root user. When A wants to register in<br>
the server a purse Px belonging to a member X of the family, A has first to insert<br>
the root card in the server. The server will then execute the user authentication<br>
process as explained previously in view of Fig. 7 between a client and a smart<br>
card.<br>
If A enters the root PIN on the user interface of the server, the<br>
hashing value of this entered PIN will match H(root PIN) which is stored in the<br>
server and A will be authorized to enter a new purse in the server for<br>
registration. In the contrary, the registration operation will be canceled.<br>
When authorized, A has to insert the smart card belonging to user X<br>
in the server. The purse_id Px of this smart card will then be registered in the<br>
server and X will be able to receive tokens from other purses of the system. Of<br>
course, the root user A may also enter some other auxiliary information about<br>
the user X such as his/her name.<br>
It should be noticed that, when the electronic wallet system is<br>
delivered to the customer with a number of smart card corresponding to the<br>
number of people in the family, the smart cards are in a "virgin" state. That<br>
means that they contain a unique purse_id, the secret key DFW_SK and the<br>
hashing H(PIN) of the PIN associated with this card but they contain neither<br>
token nor information about the user to whom they will belong.<br>
3. Protection of messages between a client and the server<br>
During the inter-purse transfer of tokens which involves two<br>
processes ("token deposit" and "token receipt") described previously in view of<br>
Fig. 4 and 5, messages exchanged between the server and one client have to<br>
be protected as follows.	<br><br>
a) Messages exchanged during the token deposit process<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, three messages denoted by<br>
"AskTokenDeposit()", "ListPurses()" and "Deposit()" are exchanged during this<br>
process. Fig. 8 illustrates the improved process in which security features have<br>
been added.<br>
At first, a first challenge C1 is generated in the client and<br>
concatenated to the message "AskTokenDeposit()" when it is sent to the server<br>
at step 150. As previously mentioned, the challenge is a random number which<br>
is unique for each token assignment process. This feature aims at preventing<br>
an intruder to replay messages exchanged during previous token deposit<br>
process in order to debit purses which ask for a token deposit process.<br>
When receiving this message, the server temporally stores the<br>
challenge C1 and generates a challenge C2 and it concatenates these two<br>
challenges to the "ListPursesQ" message which is sent back to the client at step<br>
151. On receipt of this, the client temporally stores the challenge C2. It will then<br>
concatenate the "DepositQ" message to the two challenges C1 and C2 and<br>
encrypt the global message using the DFW_SK key. This encrypted message is<br>
sent to the server at step 152. The use of the two challenges C1 and C2 aims at<br>
preventing the "Deposit()" message, which is dedicated to credit a registered<br>
purse, to be replayed to credit several times the same purse.<br>
In addition, the "Deposit()" message, which includes sensitive data<br>
(amount of tokens, recipient purse,...) is encrypted using the DFW_SK key in<br>
order to prevent a fraudulent user to modify these data during transmission of<br>
the message.<br>
Moreover, the security features should ensure that money cannot be<br>
double spent. Therefore, before sending the "DepositQ" message at step 152,<br>
the client debits the purse, i.e. the smart card inserted in the client, of the<br>
amount of tokens to be transferred to another purse. Debited tokens will be<br>
newly created and stored on the server side on receipt of the "DepositQ"<br>
message.<br>
Finally, in case of transmission problems or if the server has been<br>
unable to process the token deposit operation, the smart card must be credited<br>
again. For this purpose, a new message "CompletionCodeMsg()" is created by<br>
the server and sent back to the client at step 153. The client can then check the<br>
completion code of the operation. If the completion code indicates no error, an<br>
operation receipt is stored in the smart card corresponding to the debited purse,<br>
and in the other cases, the purse is credited again. This<br>
"CompletionCodeMsg()" message is concatenated to challenge C1 and<br><br>
challenge C2 and is encrypted using key DFW_SK before being sent at step<br>
153.<br>
b) Messages exchanged during the token receipt process<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, four types of messages denoted by<br>
"GetNumberOfActionsO", "NumberOfActionsQ", "GetNextAction()" and<br>
"Action()" are exchanged between the server and one client during this process.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates the improved process in which security features have been<br>
added.<br>
Messages "GetNumberOfActions()" and "NumberOfActions()", which<br>
are sent at steps 160 and 161 (similar to steps 60 and 61 in Fig. 5), do not<br>
contain any sensitive data. They can thus be sent as plain text.<br>
However, the security features for the other messages should ensure<br>
that all actions which are stored on the server are protected so that a user A<br>
who owns a purse PA must not be able to route actions stored for a purse PB<br>
belonging to a user B towards his own purse PA. Therefore, even if the<br>
message "Action()" is protected (as we will see below), the user A should not be<br>
able to send the message "GetNextAction()" for a purse other than his own<br>
since in this case, the server clears the requested actions and thus the right<br>
recipient purse will never be credited. For this purpose, both messages<br>
"GetNextAction()" and "Action()", sent at steps 162 and 163, are encrypted<br>
using the shared secret key DFW_SK in order to protect the purse_id<br>
parameter.<br>
The security features of the token receipt process should also ensure<br>
that the message "GetNextAction()" cannot be replayed. Indeed, even if this<br>
message is encrypted, a solution should be proposed which ensures that an<br>
intruder cannot replay it because in this case, the next action stored in the<br>
server and intended to credit the corresponding purse will be cleared.<br>
For this purpose, according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, each purse P, that is each smart card C, has a "transaction identifier"<br>
(denoted by Transldcp) of the last token recovery transaction. During the<br>
registration process (explained above in section 2.) the server set TransldcP<br>
(which is stored in the smart card) to zero, and creates a new transaction<br>
identifier denoted by TransldsP and which is also equal to zero. TransldsP is<br>
stored in the server's local data, in the entry corresponding to the registered<br>
purse P. In this way, for each registered purse, there exist two transaction<br>
identifiers which are used in this recovery process to show the validity of<br>
exchanged messages.	<br><br>
Now, to ensure that the message "GetNextAction()" cannot be<br>
replayed, the transaction identifier TransldcP (stored in the smart card<br>
representing purse P) is concatenated to this message and the global message<br>
is encrypted using the shared secret key DFW_SK before being sent at step<br>
162. Upon reception, the server verifies that TransldcP= TransldsP.<br>
If the verification is positive, the server has to send the "Action()"<br>
message to the client.<br>
The security features of the token receipt process should moreover<br>
ensure that the "Action()" message should not be replayed to credit several<br>
times the same purse. Therefore, before the server sends the "Action()"<br>
message to the client, it increments the transaction identifier TransldsP of the<br>
corresponding recipient purse P stored in the server, it inserts this incremented<br>
TransldsP in the message and sends then the message at step 163 after having<br>
encrypted it using key DFW_SK.<br>
Upon reception, the client can check the validity of the message by<br>
verifying : TransldcP=TransldsP -1.<br>
If the verification is positive, the transaction identifier TransldcP<br>
stored in the smart card inserted in the client is incremented and the action is<br>
executed.<br>
Finally, the security features of the token receipt process should<br>
moreover ensure that a user who has credited his purse cannot claim that his<br>
purse has never been credited. To this end, a further message denoted by<br>
"CompletionCodeMsg(purse_id,action,code)" (where "purse_id' is the identifier<br>
of the purse inserted in the client, "action" is the action executed and "code" is a<br>
completion code indicating the status of the executed action) is sent by the<br>
client towards the server at step 165 after execution of the action received. This<br>
message is dedicated to give information on the status of the executed<br>
operation. In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the transaction identifier<br>
TransldcP stored in the smart card is concatenated to the message<br>
"CompletionCodeMsgO" to ensure the non replay property and the global<br>
message is encrypted using the shared secret key DFW_SK to protect its<br>
content during transmission at step 165.<br>
4. Protection of commands between a client and a smart card<br>
At the deepest level of implementation, commands are exchanged<br>
between the Wallet Manager software that runs on each client and the smart<br>
card inserted in the client in order to credit or debit tokens on the card<br>
representing a purse.<br><br>
The security applied on these commands should ensure that :<br>
i) all commands sent towards the smart card cannot be replayed to<br>
credit or debit a purse. For this purpose, the smart card generates a challenge<br>
C1 to prevent all sent commands to be replayed;<br>
ii) an intruder cannot disconnect the link between the client and the<br>
smart card and replay previous smart card's actions in order to avoid to debit<br>
the purse. In this case, money can be created in double since the purse has not<br>
been decremented and the intruder has responded to the command of the<br>
client. For this purpose, the client generates a challenge C2 to authenticate the<br>
purse.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the protection of a command "Cmd' between a<br>
client and a smart card.<br>
We suppose that the client has to send a command Cmd to the card.<br>
First of all, it asks for a challenge to the smart card to ensure the freshness of<br>
the request. A first challenge C1 generated in the smart card is sent at step 170<br>
to the client.<br>
Next, the client concatenates the challenge C1 with a second<br>
challenge C2 generated in the client and with the command Cmd to form a new<br>
message denoted by Cmd|C1|C2. Then, this new message is encrypted using<br>
the secret key DFW_SK and is sent at step 171 to the smart card.<br>
On the smart card side, the integrity and the validity of the message<br>
can be checked by decrypting the received message using the shared secret<br>
key DFW_SK and by retrieving the challenge C1. Once the command Cmd is<br>
executed, the smart card responds to the client by sending a message<br>
containing a completion code "CompletionCode" concatenated with the two<br>
challenges C1 and C2 and encrypted using key DFW_SK.<br><br>
