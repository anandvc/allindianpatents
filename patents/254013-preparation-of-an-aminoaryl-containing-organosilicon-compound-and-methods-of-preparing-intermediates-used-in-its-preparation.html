				<td>Technical Field	<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method of manufacturing an aminoaryl-containing<br>
organosilicon compound and to a method of manufacturing an intermediate product of the<br>
aforementioned compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Organosilicon compounds having aminoaryl groups are know per se, and examples of several<br>
methods suitable for synthesis of these compounds have been published. For example,<br>
Journal of Organic Chemistry, No. 51, page 2434(1986) discloses a method of synthesis of a<br>
p-dimethylmethoxysilylaniline or p-methylmethoxyphenylaniline by preparing a<br>
Grignard reagent from an N,N-bis (trimethylsilyl)-p-bromoaniline and deprotecting [the<br>
obtained product] with methanol after reaction with, a dimethyldichlorosilane or<br>
diphenyldichlorosilane. In this example, however, a Grignard reagent is used also for<br>
synthesis of the N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)-p-bromoamline, and since the low-efficient Grignard<br>
reaction has to be repeated twice, the aforementioned method is not suitable for commercial<br>
use.<br>
[0003]<br>
On the other hand, practical examples of Japanese Patent Application Publication (hereinafter<br>
Kokai) H8-99979 disclose a specific method of synthesis of N,N-bis (trimethylsilyl)<br>
bromoaniline for use as a starting material. However, this method is based on the use of N-<br>
trimethylsilyldiethylamine which is a readily available material. Alternatively, the method<br>
requires specific synthesis of N-trimethylsilyl-p-bromoaniline which is not easy to perform.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
Furthermore, Synthetic Communication, No.16, p. 809 (1986) discloses a method of synthesis<br>
of 4-dimethylmethoxysilyl-2,6-diethylaniline. This method, however, cannot be<br>
implemented on an industrial scale since it utilizes an organic lithium agent that is even less<br>
efficient than the Grignard reagent and therefore requires that the synthesis reaction be<br>
conducted in two stages.<br>
[0005]<br>
Journal of Organic Chemistry, No. 66, p. 7449 (2001) discloses a coupling reaction that is<br>
conducted between a p-iodoaniline and a trimethoxysilane in the presence of a catalyst. This<br>
method is rather impractical for industrial application since it requires the use of a large<br>
mount of an expensive palladium catalyst.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
Based on the above description of the state of the art, the present invention is aimed at<br>
providing an efficient method for manufacturing an aminoaryl-containing organosilicon<br>
compound without the use of an organic lithium agent having low efficiency or an expensive<br>
palladium agent and at performing the aforementioned method in a single Grignard reaction.<br>
It is another object to provide an intermediate product of the aforementioned organosilicon<br>
compound.<br>
[0007]<br>
The inventors herein have conducted a profound study aimed at achieving the above objects.<br>
Based on the results of this study, it has been found that an aminoaryl-containing<br>
organosilicon compound can be synthesized by:<br><br>
causing a reaction between a compound of general formula (2):<br><br>
(where Rl, R2, R3, and R4 are independently alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R5 is an<br>
oxygen atom or an alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R6, R7, R8, and R9<br>
independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an<br>
alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and X is a halogen atom) and an active metal or a<br>
metalloorganic compound of general formula (3):<br>
R11MX	(3)<br>
(where R11 is a univalent hydrocarbon group, Mis a bivalent metal, X is a halogen atom),<br>
thus preparing a Grignard compound of general formula (4):<br><br>
(where R1, R2, R3, R4, R5,R6, R7, R8, R9, M, and X are the same as defined above);<br>
causing a reaction between the obtained Grignard compound and an organosilicon<br>
compound of general formula (5):<br>
YnSiR104.-n	(5)<br>
(where Y, R10, and n are the same as defined above), thus obtaining an organosilicon<br>
compound of general formula (1):<br><br><br>
(where R1, R2, R3, R4, R5,R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, Y, n are the same as defined above, and m is an<br>
integer between 1 and n);<br>
deprotecting the obtained organosilicon compound; and then obtaining the target<br>
compound of general formula (6):<br>
[Sixth Chemical Formula]<br><br>
(where R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, Y, n, and m are the same as defined above) in a single-stage<br>
Grignard reaction. Thus the authors arrived at the present invention.<br>
[0008]<br>
The aforementioned compound of general formula (2) can be produced by causing a reactio:<br>
between a compound represented by general formula (7):<br><br><br>
(where Rl, R2, R3, and R4 are independently alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R5 is an<br>
oxygen atom or an alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and Z1 and Z2 independently<br>
represent halogen atoms) and a compound represented by general formula (8):<br><br>
(where R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to<br>
4 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and X is a halogen atom), the<br>
reaction being carried out under basic conditions and in the absence of an organic metal<br>
compound.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
Arninoaryl-containing organosilicon compounds are suitable for use as a starting material for<br>
polyimide resin, polyimide silicone resin, etc. Since such compounds have higher thermal<br>
stability than conventional aminoalkyl-containing organosilicon compounds, they are suitable<br>
for use as silane coupling agents for high-temperature applications. The effect of the<br>
invention consists of providing such animoaryl-containing organosilicon compounds that can<br>
be synthesized with high production efficiency.<br><br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention allows synthesis of an aminoaryl-containning organosilicon compound<br>
in the following three steps:<br>
1.	Synthesis of the compound of general formula (2);<br>
2.	Synthesis of an organosilicon compound of general formula (1) from a compound of<br>
general formula (2) by a Grignard reaction; and<br>
3.	Deprotection of the organosilicon compound of general formula (1).<br>
Each of these steps will now be considered separately.<br>
[0011]<br><step><br>
According to the invention, the silyl-protected haloaniline compound of general formula (2):<br><br>
(where R1, R2, R3, and R4 independently represent alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R5 represents an oxygen atom or an alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and X represents a halogen atom)<br>
is used as an intermediate product for synthesis of the aminoaryl-containing organosilicon<br>
compound of general formula (6).<br>
[0012]<br>
The alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms may be represented by a methyl group, ethyl<br>
group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group, iso-butyl group, sec-butyl group, and tert-<br>
butyl group. The methyl group is preferable.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
The alkoxy groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms may be represented by a methoxy group, ethoxy<br>
group, propoxy group, isopropoxy group, butoxy group, iso-butoxy group, sec-butoxy group,<br>
and tert-butoxy group, of which the methoxy group or the ethoxy group is preferable.<br>
[0014]<br>
The alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms can be represented by a methylene group,<br>
ethylene group, propylene group, isopropylene (-CH2 -CH (CH3) -) group, butylenes group,<br>
iso-butylene (-CH2 -CH(CH3) -CH2 -) group, sec-butylene (CH(CH3) -CH2 - CH2-), and tert-<br>
butylene (-CH2 -C(CH3)2 -). The methylene and ethylene groups are preferable. Most<br>
preferable is the ethylene group.<br>
[0015]<br>
The halogen atom can be represented by a fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, or<br>
iodine atom, of which chlorine or bromine atom, and especially chlorine atom is preferable.<br>
[0016]<br>
The compound of general formula (2) can be easily synthesized by causing a reaction<br>
between the compound of general formula (7):<br><br>
(where R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R5 is an<br>
oxygen atom or an alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and Z1 and Z2 independently<br>
represent halogen atoms) and a compound represented by general formula (8):<br><br><br>
(where R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to<br>
4 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and .X is a halogen atom), the<br>
reaction being carried out under basic conditions and without the presence of an organic<br>
metal compound.<br>
[00171<br>
The compound of general formula (7) can be exemplified, e.g., by 1,3-dichloro-1, 1,3,3-<br>
tetraisopropyldisiloxane, 1,2-bis (chlorodimethylsilyl) ethane, etc.<br>
[0018]<br>
The compound of general formula (8) can be represented by m-chloroaniline, p-chloroaniline,<br>
m-bromoaniline, p-bromoaniline, 2,6-diethyl-4-bromoaniline, etc.<br>
[0019]<br>
The aforementioned basic conditions are achieved without an organic metal compound but<br>
with the use of a sodium carbonate, or other inorganic basic compounds, or with the use of<br>
amines, or other organic basic compounds. The use of organic basic compounds is preferable.<br>
Examples of such organic basic compounds are the following: triethylamine, picoline, 1,8-<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0] undeca-7-ene, or similar aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, or cyclic<br>
amines. Triethylamine, or similar tertiary aliphatic amines are most preferable from the point<br>
of view of reactivity with respect to the compound of general formula (7).<br>
[0020]<br>
The compound of general formula (7) is available on the market in the form of several<br>
reagents, each of which can be used for the purposes of the invention. If necessary, however,<br>
this compound can be synthesized by a known reaction between simple compounds. For<br><br>
example, 1,2-bis (chlorodimethylsilyl) ethane can be easily synthesized by means of a<br>
bydrosilation reaction between a chlorodimethylvinylsilane and chlorodimethylsilane.<br>
[0021]<br>
The compound of general formula (8) is readily available since it is commercially produced<br>
in the form of several reagents.<br>
[0022]<br>
The reaction between the compounds of general formulae (7) and (8) can be easily<br>
performed, e.g., by mixing these compounds in the presence of the aforementioned basic<br>
compound, but to avoid intense reaction, it is recommended to add one of the compounds<br>
dropwise to a system that contains the other compound. A reaction between both compounds<br>
creates a salt of the aforementioned basic compound.<br>
[0023]<br>
The reaction can be carried out at a temperature within the range of 0 to 120°C, preferably<br>
between room temperature and 80°C.<br>
[0024]<br>
A solvent is not an indispensable component of the aforementioned reaction, but for<br>
improving stirring conditions during the reaction, a solvent that is inert with respect to the<br>
compounds (7) and (8) can be used. Examples of such solvent are toluene, xylene, heptane,<br>
etc.<br>
[0025]<br>
Upon completion of the reaction between compounds (7) and (8), compound of formula (2)<br>
can be separated from the reaction product by filtering or washing out the basic compound<br>
salt. The obtained compound of general formula (2) can be further subjected to purification<br>
via distillation or another process for increasing the yield of the reaction that will be<br>
described later.<br><br>
[0026]<br><step2><br>
In the next step, the compound of general formula (2) is converted into a Grignard reagent.<br>
The Grignard reagent of the compound of formula (2) can be easily synthesized by a<br>
conventional Grignard preparation method. In accordance with the invention, the compound<br>
of general formula (2) is caused to react with an active metal or an organic metal compound<br>
. of general formula (3):<br>
R11MX	(3)<br>
(where R11 is a univalent hydrocarbon group, M is a bivalent metal, and X is a halogen<br>
atom), whereby a Grignard reagent of general formula (4) is produced:<br><br>
(where Rl, R2, R3, R4, R5,R6, R7, R8, R9, M, and X are the same as defined above).<br>
[0027]<br>
The univalent hydrocarbon group can be represented by a univalent saturated hydrocarbon<br>
group having 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, and even more preferably, 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or by<br>
a univalent unsaturated hydrocarbon group having 2 to 10, preferably 2 to 8 or 2 to 6, and<br>
even more preferably, 2 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
[0028]<br>
The aforementioned univalent saturated hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
can be exemplified by a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl<br>
group, isobutyl group, sec-butyl group, tert-butyl group, pentyl group, hexyl group, heptyl<br>
group, octyl group, nonyl group, decyl group, or other alkyl groups.<br><br>
[0029]<br>
The aforementioned unsaturated hydrocarbon groups with 2 to 10 carbon atoms can be<br>
divided into unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups with 2 to 10 carbon atoms and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon groups with 6 to 10 carbon atoms. The unsaturated aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon groups with 2 to 10 carbon atoms can be exemplified by a vinyl group, 1-<br>
propenyl group, allyl group, isopropenyl group, 1-butenyl group, 2-butenyl group, or similar<br>
alkenyl groups. The vinyl group is preferable from the point of view of cross-linking<br>
reactivity of the polysiloxane. The aromatic hydrocarbon group with 6 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
can be represented by a phenyl group, tolyi group, xylyl group, etc.<br>
[0030]<br>
Among all univalent hydrocarbon groups, most preferable is the alkyl group with 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, especially, the methyl group.<br>
[0031]<br>
The bivalent metal atoms along with active metals can be represented by alkali earth metals<br>
or zinc group metals, especially magnesium or zinc.<br>
[0032]<br>
It is recommended to carry out the reaction between the compound of general formula (2) and<br>
the active metal or the organic metal compound of general formula (3) in the presence of an<br>
ether-type solvent. For example, the Grignard reagent of general formula (4) can be easily<br>
prepared by gradually adding an ether solution of the compound of formula (2) in a dropwise<br>
manner to the organic metal compound of general formula (3) or the active metal in an ether<br>
solvent.<br>
[0033]<br>
The aforementioned ether solvent may be exemplified by diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, bis<br>
(2-methoxyethyl) ether, or other ether-type solvent normally used for synthesis of Grignard<br>
reagents. Tetrahydrofuran is preferable in view of its high reactivity and low cost.<br><br>
[0034]<br>
The reaction can be carried out at a temperature within the range of 0°C to the boiling point<br>
of the solvent, but preferably between 50°C and 80°C.<br>
[0035]<br>
The obtained Grignard reagent of general formula (4) is then caused to react with a silicon<br>
compound of general formula (5):<br>
YnSiR104.n	(5)<br>
(where Y is a hydrolysable group, R10 is a univalent hydrocarbon group, and n is an integer<br>
between 1 and 4),<br>
whereby an organosilicon compound of general formula (1);<br><br>
(where,<br>
R1, R2, R3, and R4 independently represent alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R5 represents an oxygen atom or an alkylene group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R10 represents a univalent hydrocarbon group;<br>
Yrepresents ahydrolysable group;<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 4; and<br>
m is an integer between 1 and n) is synthesized. The organosilicon compound of general<br>
formula (1) comprises a second intermediate product used in the synthesis of the aminoaryl-<br>
containing organosilicon compound of general formula (6).<br><br>
[0036]<br>
The hydrolysable group can be exemplified by an arbitrary hydrolysable group, but<br>
preferable are halogen atoms and alkoxy groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially,<br>
chlorine atoms, methoxy groups, and ethoxy groups.<br>
[0037]<br>
The following are specific examples of silicon compounds of general formula (5):<br>
chlorotrimethylsilane, dimehtyldichlorosilane, tetrachlorosilane, methoxytrimethylsilane,<br>
dimethoxydimethylsilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, etc.<br>
[0038]<br>
Equivalent relationships in the reaction between the Grignard reagent of general formula (4)<br>
and the silicon compound of formula (5) can be arbitrary, and the appropriate equivalent<br>
quantities are selected with reference to the required values of "m" and "n". For example,<br>
when it is necessary to obtain an organosilicon compound with n &gt; 1 and m = 1, it is<br>
recommended, for an increase in the product yield, to use the silicon compound of general<br>
formula (5) in an excess of the Grignard reagent of general formula (4) by 2 to 5 equivalent<br>
amounts. On the other hand, when it is necessary to obtain the organosilicon compound with<br>
n = m, the Grignard reagent of general formula (4) should be used either in the same<br>
equivalent amount as the silicon compound of general formula (5) or in a small excess over<br>
the silicon compound.<br>
[0039]<br>
Normally, the aforementioned reaction is carried out either with dropwise addition of the<br>
silicon compound of formula (5) to the Grignard reagent of formula (4), or, vice verse, with<br>
dropwise addition of the Grignard reagent of formula (4) to the silicon compound of formula<br>
(5).<br>
[0040]<br>
When in the above reaction the Grignard reagent of formula (4) is prepared with participation<br>
of a solvent, this solvent can be used as a continuous reaction solvent. Furthermore, if<br><br>
necessary, a solvent inert to the reagents, such as toluene, xylene, heptane, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
etc., can be added to the reaction system.<br>
[0041]<br>
It is recommended to conduct the last mentioned reaction at a temperature within the range of<br>
-20°C to 80°C, preferably at a temperature between 0°C and 20°C.<br>
[0042]<br>
Upon completion of the above reaction, the organosilicon compound of formula (1) is<br>
separated by removing the salt formed in the reaction by filtering or washing, and, if<br>
necessary, the solvent is removed by distillation. Alternatively, the reaction mixture can be<br>
used for the next step as it is, i.e., without separation operations.<br>
[0043]<br><step><br>
The organosilicon compound of general formula (1) is subjected to a deprotection reaction<br>
and is turned into an aminoaryl-containing organosilicon compound of general formula (6):<br><br>
(where R6, R7, R8, and R9 independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to<br>
4 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R10 represents a univalent hydrocarbon group;<br>
Y represents a hydrolysable group;<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 4; and<br>
m is an integer between 1 and n).<br><br>
[0044]<br>
The deprotection reaction is a reaction that is carried out, preferably in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, between a compound having an active hydrogen atom and the organosilicon<br>
compound of general formula (1).<br>
[0045]<br>
A catalyst suitable for the aforementioned reaction is a compound that can be used as an<br>
acidic or a basic compound. The acidic compound may be represented by a mineral acid or its<br>
salt, such as a hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, aminonium chloride, etc. The basic compound<br>
can be exemplified by a metal hydroxide or alkoxide, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium methoxide, or the like. In some cases, when impurities or by-products<br>
present in the reaction system may function as catalysts, the reaction may be carried out<br>
without addition of a catalyst.<br>
[0046]<br>
From the view point of improved reactivity to the organosilicon compound of general<br>
formula (1), it is recommended that the aforementioned compound with active hydrogen<br>
comprises one with a hydroxyl group. Examples of such compounds are water, methanol,<br>
ethanol, and the like.<br>
[0047]<br>
It is recommended that deprotection be carried out at a temperature close to room<br>
temperature, but if necessary, the deprotection reaction can be carried out with heating. The<br>
reaction may be carried out without the presence of a solvent in the reaction system. If<br>
necessary, however, a solvent, neutral to the reagents of the reaction, such as toluene, xylene,<br>
heptene, tetrahydrofuran, etc. can be present.<br>
[0048]<br>
Upon completion of the deprotection reaction, the aminoaryl-containing organosilicon<br>
compound of general formula (6) can be purified to a sufficient purity by removing by-<br>
products via stripping. If necessary, further purification can be conducted by distillation or<br>
by other means.<br><br>
[0049]<br>
A product of hydrolyzation of the aminoaryl-containing organosilicon compound of general<br>
formula (6) can be obtained by reacting the aminoaryl-containing organosilicon compound of<br>
general formula (6) with water as a compound that contains active hydrogen. In case the<br>
active-hydrogen containing compound is water, the deprotection reaction can be carried out<br>
simultaneously with the hydrolyzation reaction, whereby synthesis of a product of hydrolysis<br>
of the aminoaryl-containing organosilicon compound of general formula (6) can be<br>
simplified.<br>
[0050]<br>
The following are examples of the aforementioned aminoaryl-containing organosilicon<br>
compounds of general formula (6) and products of the hydrolyzation: p-aminophenyl-<br>
trimethylsilane, bis (p-aminophenyl) dimethylsilane, p-aminophenyl-trimethoxysilane, bis (p-<br>
aminophenyl) dimethoxysilane, p-aminophenyl-dimethylmethoxysilane, p-aminophenyl-<br>
triethoxysilane, 1,3-bis (p-aminophenyl) 1,1,3,3-tetramethylsiloxane, m-<br>
aminophenyltrimethylsilane, m-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane, o-aminophenyl-<br>
trimethylsilane, o-arrdnophenyltrimethoxysilane, (4-amino-3,5-diethylphenyl)<br>
trimethylsilane, etc.<br>
[Practical Examples]<br>
[0051]<br>
The invention will be further described in more detail with reference to practical examples,<br>
which, however, should not be construed as limiting the scope of application of the invention.<br>
[0052]<br>
[Practical Example 1]<br>
A1-liter four-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and a refiuxing cooler was<br>
loaded with 63.8 g (0.5 mole) of p-chloroaniline, 111.3 g (1.1 mole) of triethylamine, and<br>
toluene (200 g). While the components were stirred, a solution of 107.6 g (0.5 mole) of 1,2-<br>
bis (chlorodimethylsilyl) ethane in 60 g of toluene were added dropwise. The reaction heat<br>
raised the temperature in the system from room temperature to 45°C. After the reaction<br>
mixture was aged by hot refiuxing for 2 hours at 110°C, it was cooled to room temperature,<br><br>
the salt was removed by filtering, and after the solvent was removed by distillation in<br>
vacuum, a compound of general formula (I):<br><br>
was produced with a yield of 89%.<br>
[0053]<br>
[Practical Example 2]<br>
A 300-milliliter four-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and a refluxing cooler<br>
was loaded with 5.35 g (0.22 mole) of magnesium and 54 g of tetrahydrofuran, and then the<br>
content was activated by adding 1.85 g (0.02 mole) of t-butyl chloride, while the components<br>
were stirred in a nitrogen flow.<br>
[0054]<br>
An appropriate Grignard reagent was prepared by adding a solution of 54;0 g (0.2 mole) of<br>
the compound of the aforementioned formula obtained in Practical Example 1 in 54 g of<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The solution was added dropwise at 55°C. The obtained Grignard reagent<br>
solution was added dropwise to a solution of 21.7 g (0.2 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane in 30<br>
g of tetrahydrofuran. The salt formed in the reaction was removed by filtering, and a<br>
deprotection reaction was carried out by adding 5 0 g of methanol. Sodium methoxide was<br>
added until the liquid became neutral, the solvent was removed by distillation, and the<br>
product was again distilled in vacuum to produce a p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane with a<br>
yield of 62%.<br>
[0055]<br>
[Practical Example 3]<br>
A compound of formula (H):<br><br><br>
was produced with a yield of 79% in the same manner as in Practical Example 1, except that<br>
m-chloroaniline was used instead of the p-chloroaniline.<br>
[0056]<br>
[Practical Example 4]<br>
A 300-milliliter four-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and a refluxing cooler<br>
was loaded with 5.35 g (0.22 mole) of magnesium and 54 g of tetrahydrofuran, and then the<br>
content was activated by adding 3.76 g (0.02 mole) of 1,2-dibromoethane, while the<br>
components were stirred in a nitrogen flow.<br><br>
[0057]<br>
An appropriate Grignard reagent was prepared by adding a solution of 54.0 g (0.2 mole) of<br>
the compound of the aforementioned formula obtained in Practical Example 3 in 54 g of<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The solution was added dropwise at 55°C. The obtained Grignard reagent<br>
solution was added dropwise to 91.3 g (0.6 mole) of tetramethoxysilane. The salt formed in<br>
the reaction was removed by filtering, and after distillation in vacuum, a compound of<br>
formula (ID):<br><br>
was produced with a yield of 54%.<br>
[0058]<br>
[Practical Example 5]<br>
A 100-milliliter three-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and a refluxing cooler<br>
was loaded with 33.8 g (0.95 mole) of the compound of the aforementioned formula obtained<br><br><br>
in Practical Example 4 and 35 g of tetrahydrofuran. Methanol (15 g) was then added<br>
dropwise. The reaction heat raised the temperature of the system from room temperature to<br>
48°C. After the solvent was removed by distillation, the product was distilled in vacuum to<br>
produce m-aminophenyl trimethoxysilane with a yield of 96%.<br>
[0059],<br>
[Practical Example 6]<br>
An appropriate Grignard reagent corresponding to the compound of formula (H) was<br>
prepared by the same method as in Practical Example 4. The obtained Grignard reagent was<br>
added dropwise to 72.1 g (0.6 mole) of a dimethoxydimethylsilane. The salt formed in the<br>
process was removed by filtering, and the product was distilled in vacuum to produce a<br>
compound of formula (IV):<br><br>
with the yield of 58%.<br>
[0060]<br>
[Practical Example 7]<br>
A 100-milliliter three-neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and a refluxing cooler<br>
was loaded with 40.7 g (0.126 mole) of the compound of aforementioned formula (IV).<br>
Methanol (10 g) was then added dropwise. The reaction heat raised the temperature of the<br>
system from room temperature to 65°C. After the residual methanol was removed by<br>
distillation, the product was distilled in vacuum to produce m-aminophenyl<br>
dimethylmethoxysilane with a yield of 96%. The obtained product was hydrolyzed,<br>
whereby an oil having 1,3-bis (m-arninophenyl)-1.1.3.3-tetramethyldisiloxane as amain<br>
component was obtained.<br><br>
