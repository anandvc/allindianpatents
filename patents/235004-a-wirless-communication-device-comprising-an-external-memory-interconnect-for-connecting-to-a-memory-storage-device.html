Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention This invention relates in general to wireless communication devices and more particularly to wireless communication devices having Internet browser capability.<br>
Description of the Related Art Historically, wireless communication devices, such as cellular telephones and two way messaging devices, have had the ability to receive data and/or voice messages sent from a wireless communication system, and perform standard functions in response to message receipt such as storing the message, displaying the message, or alerting the user of receipt of the message. Data messages are typically a numeric message such as a phone number, or an alphanumeric message containing one unique piece of information such as "meeting in my office at 6:00pm."<br>
The user is alerted of receipt of a new message by an audible alert or a vibratory alert. The display of many wireless communication devices today includes a message indicator for each message it has received and stored in memory. This message indicator allows a quick view for the user of how many messages are in the wireless communication device and also allows the user to quickly pick a message to<br><br><br><br><br>
view.    The display further can include a call receipt message indicating to the user a new call is being received and/or the source of the new call.<br>
Today, methods and systems have been developed in an attempt to satisfy the increasing demand for information, multimedia and other communication services on wireless communication devices. One of the most popular techniques of obtaining these services is through the Internet. The Internet is collection of over 25,000 computer networks connected through a communication backbone (NSFNET backbone) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and is currently managed by Advanced Network System (ANS). A subscriber obtains an account with an organization's host computer (server) that is connected to the Internet through one or more networks. Traditionally, the subscriber is connected to the server through telephone lines using a personal computer (PC) and a modem. As use of the Internet becomes more popular, different methods of accessing the Internet have been developed. For example, users can access the Internet using a wireless communication device.<br>
Internet enabled wireless devices such as cellular telephones and two way messaging devices, for example, can include a browser application with the same functionality as a browser application traditionally installed within a fixed device such as a personal computer. One key concern to both the network service providers and the individual subscribers is restriction of access to unauthorized or unacceptable Internet websites. It is further desirable to provide such restriction using a customizable, flexible, system, which does not limit transportability among the various wireless communication devices.<br>

FIG. 2 is an electronic block diagram of the memory storage device 105 for use with the wireless communication device 10 of FIG. 1 in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, the memory storage device 105 is a SIM card that is programmed with various information files as per GSM 11.11 or 3GPP 31.101 specifications. The memory storage device 105, for example, includes a card processor 130 and a card memory 120. Within the card memory 120, a plurality of information can be stored including an identification of communication channel 125 for receipt of messages by the connected wireless communication device and a decryption key 135 for security purposes. In accordance with the present invention, a restricted URL list file 140 is stored within the card memory 120. This file will contain the list of URLs need to be restricted for access. In one embodiment, the restricted URL list file 140 can be written to and/or modified using an authorized pin number, hi this embodiment, only an authorized individual with access to the pin number can modify the list of the restricted access URLs on the memory storage device 105. hi another embodiment, the restricted URL list file 140 can be written to and/or modified using a message received from the communication system 75. For example, the wireless communication device in which the memory storage device is connected can receive a message include an update to the restricted URL list file 140, and in response, the processor 40 can send a command to the memory storage device 105 via the external memory interconnect 50 to update the restricted URL list file 140. Alternatively, the memory storage device 105 can include a transceiver (not shown) for communicating directly with the communication system 75. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the restricted access can be total barring of access to minimal restriction of access by the browser application 70 of the connected wireless communication device 10. Restriction, for<br>
example, can include customized blocking of Internet websites, instant messaging, newsgroups, FTP, and IRC. In one embodiment, restricted access can be based on categories such as illegal activity/drugs, hate/intolerance, cults, gambling, and the like.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the wireless communication device 10 using the memory storage device 105 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   Specifically, FIG. 3 illustrates the operation of the browser application 70 utilizing the restricted URL list file 140 stored in the memory storage device 105. The process begins in Step 145 in which the restricted URL list file 140 is initialized at power up of the memory storage device 105. Next, in Step 150, the process determines whether a fetch command has been received for a new URL. For example, the browser application 70 can request the processor 40 to initiate a fetch command through the external memory interconnect 50 to the memory storage device 105 in response to a user input to the user interface 65. The fetch command can be received and processed by the card processor 130 of the memory storage device 105. When no fetch command has been received in Step 150, the process cycles back and continues periodically checking for a command,   hi Step 155, when a fetch command has been received in Step 150, the card processor 130 next compares the URL contained in the fetch command to a plurality of restricted URLs contained within the restricted URL list file 140.   In an alternative embodiment, the browser application 70 of the wireless communication device 10 can compare the URL contained in the fetch command to the restricted URL list file 140. In this embodiment, the processor 40 retrieves the restricted URL list file 140 and preferably stores the restricted URL list file 140 in the browser data memory 95.   The browser<br>
application 70 can then compare the desired URL to the list of URLs in the restricted URL list file 140. The In Step 160, when the URL in the fetch command is not contained within the restricted URL list file 140, the browser application 70 operates using the URL in full operation and access. In Step 165, when the URL in the fetch command is contained within the restricted URL list file 140, the browser application 70 operates using the URL in restricted operation and access when restricted, or is barred from access and operation when indicated as such. Preferably, the device user of the wireless communication device 10 is notified of the restricted or barred access using the display 60. For example, a notification of the restricted access can be displayed as a text notification, an icon notification, a graphic notification, or the like. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that alternatively, the device user can be notified of the restricted access by an audible or vibratory alert using the alert circuit 55. One benefit of the method as described herein is that the restricted access information being stored on the memory storage device 105 provides transportability of the information among a plurality of wireless communication devices.<br>
Although the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various alterations and modifications can be made without departing from the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that all such alterations and modifications be considered as within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
