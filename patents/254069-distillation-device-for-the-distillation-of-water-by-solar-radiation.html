				<td>The invention relates to a portable distillation device for<br>
water in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
There is a known portable water distillation device which<br>
comprises a transparent top sheet and a body which absorbs solar<br>
radiation placed beneath it. The space beneath the sheet is<br>
sealed off in an airtight manner, so that it can be inflated<br>
using the mouthpiece, as a type of balloon. The surface area of the transparent sheet of the known distillation device is at<br>
most 1 to 2 m2.<br>
A quantity of water that is to be distilled, such as for<br>
example seawater or contaminated water, can be placed on the<br>
body which absorbs solar radiation. The solar radiation which<br>
impinges on the absorbent body through the transparent sheet<br>
will gradually evaporate the water that is to be distilled.<br>
This evaporated water will rise up and condense on the<br>
inside of the transparent sheet. On account of the curved shape<br>
of the inner side of the transparent sheet, the condensed water<br>
will run down along the inner side of this sheet until it is<br>
collected in water collection means. A distillation device for<br>
water of this type, using solar radiation for the distillation<br>
of water, is also known as a solar water still.<br>
One drawback of the known distillation device is that it<br>
can only yield a small quantity of distilled water, since the<br>
design of the distillation device is unsuitable for use in<br>
considerably larger dimensions.<br>
It is an object of the invention to create a distillation<br>
device for water which is relatively easy to move about and is<br>
suitable for a distillation device with a larger distillation<br>
capacity than the known distillation device.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved by a distillation<br>
device in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 which is<br>
characterized in that the distillation device comprises<br>
inflation means for creating an air pressure beneath the<br>
transparent sheet.<br>
The provision of inflation means makes it possible to apply<br>
a higher air pressure beneath the transparent sheet and/or for a<br><br>
greater volume of air to be moved under the transparent sheet,<br>
so that it is possible to create a distillation device of larger<br>
dimensions, with the pressure being sufficient to keep the shape<br>
of the inflated transparent sheet stable.<br>
This pressure needs to be higher in order to be able to<br>
support the weight of the transparent sheet and also to be able<br>
to withstand the influence of wind on the shape of the inflated<br>
transparent sheet. The retention of the shape of the inflated<br>
transparent sheet is particularly important for a water<br>
distillation device of the type described in the introduction,<br>
since this shape is used to discharge and collect the water<br>
which runs downwards along the inner side of the transparent<br>
sheet towards the water collection means. A sudden change in<br>
shape caused by the wind or a more gradual change in shape<br>
caused by wind or the weight of the transparent sheet itself may<br>
have a considerable influence on the production capacity of the<br>
water distillation device.<br>
The inflation means may, for example, comprise an air<br>
compressor or a fan. These inflation means are preferably driven<br>
by a motor, such as for example an electric motor. The energy to<br>
drive the motor can be generated, for example, by a solar panel.<br>
An additional advantage of providing inflation means is<br>
that there is no need for the space beneath the transparent<br>
sheet to be closed off in a completely airtight manner. Any<br>
pressure loss can be compensated for by using the inflation<br>
means to blow new air continuously or semi-continuously into the<br>
space beneath the transparent sheet. However, to counteract the<br>
escape of warm, humid air from the space as much as possible, it<br>
is generally desirable for the space to be kept as airtight as<br>
possible.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for the distillation device<br>
to comprise stabilizing means which are able to stabilize the<br>
shape of the transparent sheet. These stabilizing means are used<br>
to ensure that the forces which are exerted on the transparent<br>
sheet by the pressure do not have to be absorbed completely, and<br>
preferably have to be absorbed as little as possible, by the<br>
transparent sheet. The stabilizing means are preferably less<br>
stretchable than the transparent sheet.<br><br>
This is because for cost reasons and to maximize the<br>
transparency of the transparent sheet, it is desirable to<br>
minimize the thickness of the transparent sheet. The thickness<br>
of the transparent sheet can now be kept small by providing<br>
stabilizing means, while at the same time it is possible to have<br>
a high level of certainty that the transparent sheet will be<br>
substantially dimensionally stable.<br>
The stabilizing means can highly advantageously be rolled<br>
and/or folded up. Stabilizing means of this type are easy to<br>
transport. Moreover, the distillation device is easy to erect,<br>
since the stabilizing means are easy to unroll or unfold. It is<br>
preferable for other components of the distillation device, in<br>
particular the transparent sheet, also to be designed such that<br>
they can be rolled and/or folded up.<br>
The stabilizing means may, for example, comprise nets or<br>
bands, such as tensioning bands, which extend over the surface<br>
of the transparent sheet. It is preferable for the stabilizing<br>
means to extend over a large part of the surface of the<br>
transparent sheet; more preferably, they are not attached to the<br>
transparent sheet. Placing the stabilizing means over a large<br>
part of the surface of the transparent sheet means that it is<br>
easy to obtain an optimum shape of the inflated sheet.<br>
Other preferred embodiments of the stabilizing means may<br>
for example comprise stabilizing means such as cables, nets or<br>
bands which are incorporated in the transparent sheet or are<br>
arranged beneath the transparent sheet. It is also possible for<br>
the stabilizing means to be formed by inflatable elements which<br>
are arranged on the transparent sheet.<br>
It is preferable for the stabilizing means to extend at<br>
least in one direction substantially over the length of the<br>
transparent sheet. Designing the stabilizing means in this way<br>
allows further stability of the distillation device to be<br>
obtained. It is advantageous for the stabilizing means to extend<br>
substantially over the entire surface of the transparent sheet.<br>
This results in a very stable shape of the inflated distillation<br>
device.<br>
The inflated distillation device may be of any suitable<br><br>
shape which will enable the distilled water to flow downwards<br>
along the inner side of the transparent sheet. In general, there<br>
will for this purpose be at least one sloping wall which in the<br>
inflated state preferably forms an angle of 10-50° with respect<br>
to the horizontal, more preferably 15-40O , most preferably<br>
20-30°. The shape of the inflated distillation device may, for<br>
example, be the shape of a trapezium, a pyramid, a dome or the<br>
like.<br>
In one embodiment, the stabilizing means are designed as<br>
fibres which are arranged in or on the transparent sheet.<br>
The invention also relates to a method according to<br>
claim 16 and an assembly according to claim 17.<br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the distillation<br>
device according to the invention will be explained below with<br>
reference to an exemplary embodiment which is shown in the accompanying drawing, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section through the distillation<br>
device according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross section through an alternative<br>
embodiment of a distillation device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a distillation device<br>
according to the invention, denoted overall by reference numeral<br>
1. The distillation device comprises a sheet 2 which is<br>
transparent to solar radiation and a groundsheet 3. The<br>
groundsheet 3 is provided, at least on the top side, with a<br>
material which absorbs solar radiation, for the purpose of<br>
absorbing solar radiation which passes through the transparent<br>
sheet 2 and impinges on the groundsheet 3.<br>
A quantity of water 4 that is to be distilled and is not<br>
suitable as drinking water, such as for example seawater,<br>
brackish water and contaminated water, has been placed on the<br>
groundsheet 3. A preferably closable opening (not shown) is<br>
arranged in the transparent sheet 2 or the groundsheet 3,<br>
allowing a quantity of water to be placed on the groundsheet and<br>
allowing residual water or slurry which remains behind after<br>
distillation to be removed.<br>
At the periphery, the transparent sheet 2 and the<br>
groundsheet 3 are joined to one another by means of a joining<br><br>
element '5, so as to form, as it were, a large, substantially<br>
airtight "bag". Between the transparent sheet 2 and the<br>
groundsheet 3 which are joined to one another is a pressure<br>
space 6 which can be filled with air in order to create a<br>
superatmospheric pressure, with the result that the transparent<br>
sheet can adopt a defined dome shape.<br>
There is a fan 7 which is driven by a motor 8 for blowing<br>
air into the pressure space. In the embodiment shown, this motor<br>
is an electric motor which is provided with energy by, for<br>
example, a solar panel 9 or a battery or generator or the like.<br>
As an alternative to the fan 7, it is also possible to provide<br>
inflation means of a different type, such as an air compressor<br>
or the like.<br>
A net 10 which extends substantially over the surface of<br>
the transparent sheet and is fixed to the ground at its edge is<br>
arranged over the transparent sheet 2. The material of which the<br>
net 10 is made is generally less stretenable than the material<br>
of the transparent sheet 2. It is preferable for the material of<br>
the net 10 to at least partially transmit solar radiation.<br>
As a result of air being blown into the pressure space 6,<br>
at a given moment a superatmospheric pressure will be produced<br>
in the pressure space, which will ensure that the transparent<br>
sheet 2 with the net 10 arranged over it will be inflated. In<br>
particular on account of the presence of the net which is<br>
attached to the ground all the way around, the transparent sheet<br>
2 will adopt a specific desired shape. This is because the<br>
forces resulting from the pressure on the transparent sheet 2<br>
will be absorbed by the net 10. By further increasing the<br>
pressure in the pressure space 6 by blowing in more air, it is<br>
possible to obtain a very stable shape, and relatively little<br>
stress has to be absorbed by the transparent sheet 2.<br>
Consequently, it is not necessary for the transparent sheet to<br>
be very strong/thick.<br>
This design makes it possible for the distillation device<br>
to be made considerably larger than the distillation devices for<br>
water based on solar radiation which have been disclosed<br>
hitherto.<br>
In another embodiment, it is possible to provide control<br><br>
means for controlling the pressure in the pressure space 6<br>
beneath the transparent sheet 2. Control means of this type on<br>
the one hand, for example, are able to prevent the pressure in<br>
the pressure space from becoming too high, which can cause<br>
damage to the materials of the distillation device, and on the<br>
other hand can prevent the pressure in the pressure space being<br>
too low, which can cause the shape of the inflated transparent<br>
sheet to become unstable.<br>
If the distillation device 1 is erected as shown in<br>
Figure 1, solar radiation will pass through the transparent<br>
sheet 2 and impinge on the groundsheet 3. This groundsheet 3<br>
will absorb the solar radiation and convert it into heat, with<br>
the result that the water 4 is heated. Water will evaporate and<br>
rise up. The evaporated water will at least partially condense<br>
on the inner side of the transparent sheet 2 and run downwards<br>
under the force of gravity. There, it will be collected by water<br>
collection means. In the embodiment shown, these water<br>
collection means are designed as a gutter 11 which is arranged<br>
on the transparent sheet, for example by sealing. The water can<br>
flow through this gutter 11 to one or more taps 12.<br>
The base surface area of a possible embodiment of the<br>
distillation device 1 is preferably at least 10 m2, and is<br>
preferably between 100 and 2000 m2. The yield of a distillation<br>
device of this type may vary from 3.5 to 6 litres of distillate<br>
per m2 of base area. In principle, it is possible to select any<br>
shape for the inflated transparent sheet, although it is a<br>
condition that it must be possible for the water condensed on<br>
the inner side of the transparent sheet to run towards the water<br>
collection means, preferably under the force of gravity. For<br>
design reasons, it has been found that a pyramid or half-<br>
doughnut shape (with an annular base surface) is very suitable.<br>
The transparent sheet 2 may, for example, be made from PVC,<br>
polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP), preferably with a<br>
thickness of from 0.18 to 0.5 mm. The groundsheet may, for<br>
example, be made from a black sheet of PVC, polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene with a thickness of from 0.75 to 2 mm. In the<br>
inflated state, the superatmospheric pressure in the tent may be<br>
in the range from 50-200 Pascal. If a fan is used to inflate the<br><br>
transparent sheet, the fan power during inflation is, for<br>
example, of the order of 70-400 watts.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second possible embodiment of a water<br>
distillation device according to the invention, which is denoted<br>
overall by reference numeral 20. The water distillation device<br>
20 comprises a transparent sheet 21 and a body 22 which absorbs<br>
solar radiation positioned beneath it.<br>
The body 22 which absorbs solar radiation is a body which<br>
floats on a pool 23 containing water that is to be distilled.<br>
This pool 23 may be made specially for this application but may<br>
also be an existing pool of water. The transparent sheet 21 may<br>
span the pool entirely or only partially.<br>
The material of the absorbent body 22 is such that it can<br>
hold the water to be distilled, the material preferably sucking<br>
up the water out of the pool of water 23. The material may, for<br>
example, be a black sponge-like material which is made to float<br>
by means of floats. It is also possible to provide means which<br>
hold the absorbent body 22 at least partially above the water<br>
level of the water to be distilled instead of a floating<br>
absorbent body 22 and/or to provide the absorbent body with<br>
dimensions which are such that it at least partially projects<br>
above the water level.<br>
Between the transparent sheet 21 and the pool of water 23<br>
there is a pressure space 24 into which air can be blown by the<br>
inflation means in the form of a fan 25 in order to create a<br>
certain superatmospheric pressure in the pressure space 24. A<br>
net 26, which has the same function as described above in<br>
connection with the embodiment of Figure 1, is arranged on the<br>
transparent sheet 21. As a result of the creation of the<br>
superatmospheric pressure, the transparent sheet 21 with the net<br>
26 placed over it will adopt a defined stable shape, with the<br>
result that the forces generated as a result of the<br>
superatmospheric pressure are absorbed in particular by the net<br>
26 stretched over the transparent sheet 21.<br>
At its periphery, the transparent sheet 21 is placed<br>
against the ground in as airtight a manner as possible, in order<br>
to counteract the escape of air from the pressure space 24 as<br>
much as possible. For this purpose, the periphery of the<br><br>
transparent sheet 21 is provided with a somewhat heavier flap 27<br>
which at least partially lies on the ground.<br>
It is equally possible for there to be a continuous or<br>
discontinuous air loss at the periphery of the transparent sheet<br>
21 on account of the connection between the transparent sheet 21<br>
and the ground not being completely airtight. However, this air<br>
loss can easily be compensated for by operating the fan 24<br>
continuously or semi-continuously. It is in this way also<br>
possible to compensate for other air pressure losses as a result<br>
of air escaping from the pressure space 24. It may in this<br>
respect be attractive to provide control means for controlling<br>
the pressure in the pressure space 24 as already described<br>
above.<br>
Water collection means in the form of a gutter 28 are<br>
arranged on the inner side of the transparent sheet 21. This<br>
gutter 28 collects the water which has condensed on the inner<br>
side of the transparent sheet and has then flowed downwards<br>
along the inner side of the transparent sheet, in order to pass<br>
it to one or more taps 29 which provide the fresh water to the<br>
outside of the. transparent sheet 21.<br>
As an alternative to the net shown in Figures 1 and 2, it<br>
is also possible to provide other types of stabilizing means,<br>
such as (tensioning) bands, meshes of cords or cables, or<br>
stabilizing means which are joined to the transparent sheet,<br>
such as inflatable bands or stronger strips. However, it is<br>
preferable for the stabilizing means not to be attached to the<br>
transparent sheet, in order to minimize the risk of damage. In<br>
this case, attaching the stabilizing means to the transparent<br>
sheet entails additional production steps, making the<br>
transparent sheet more expensive.<br>
One advantage of the distillation device described above is<br>
that it can be erected quickly, in particular by carrying out<br>
the following steps: laying the transparent sheet, with any<br>
ground sheet attached to it, on the ground and/or on water,<br>
placing the net or other stabilizing means over it, attaching<br>
the net to the ground at the periphery or near the periphery and<br>
inflating the transparent sheet into the desired shape.<br>
It is also possible for the distillation device to be<br><br>
dismantled/taken down quickly by allowing the air which has been<br>
blown into the pressure space to flow out of it. As a result,<br>
the distillation device can quickly be taken down, for example<br>
in the event of a hurricane or storm or the like, in order to<br>
prevent damage to the distillation device. Then, after the storm<br>
or hurricane has passed, it is quick and easy to reinflate the<br>
transparent sheet, so that the production of fresh water can be<br>
continued with the minimum possible interruption.<br>
Another advantage of the two embodiments shown is that they<br>
are easily portable. After the distillation device has been<br>
used, the pressure space can be emptied. Then, the sheet or<br>
sheets can be rolled and/or folded up so as to produce a small<br>
package. A package of this type can easily be transported in a<br>
car or lorry together with the inflation means and if<br>
appropriate the absorbent body, which is preferably also<br>
designed such that it can be rolled and/or folded up.<br>
As an alternative to the embodiment of the stabilizing<br>
means described above in the form of nets or bands or the like<br>
which are stretched over the transparent sheet, it is also<br>
possible to use other stabilizing means. In general, the<br>
stabilizing means can preferably be rolled and/or folded up.<br>
The stabilizing means may be formed, for example, by fibres<br>
or other reinforcing elements which are arranged in or on the<br>
transparent sheet. In an advantageous embodiment, the<br>
transparent sheet with stabilizing means is formed by a fibre-<br>
reinforced sheet.<br>
All these alternative embodiments of the stabilizing means<br>
are deemed to be covered by the scope of protection of the<br>
invention.<br><br><br>
