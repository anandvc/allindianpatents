				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to methods and systems for lubricating conveyor systems. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to lubricating conveyor systems, which are moving<br>
containers made of metal, glass, paper, cardboard and/or plastic, particularly containers used<br>
in the food industry. These are especially containers to be filled up with food including<br>
beverages, e.g. glass or plastic bottles, boxes, glasses, vessels, beverage containers, paper and<br>
cardboard holders and the like.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The application of aqueous conveyor lubricants for lubricating and possibly also<br>
cleaning and disinfecting conveyor systems, specifically for lubricating the inter-face<br>
between a container and a moving conveyor belt or track surface, is well known in prior art.<br>
If a conveyor system is not lubricated sufficiently, this can lead to the falling down of the<br>
containers or have the result that the containers do not stop, even though they have reached a<br>
filling, cleaning or labelling station. Both kinds of malfunctions can lead to longer standing<br>
times of the conveyor system and to a considerable loss of capacity.<br>
Aqueous conveyor lubricants are usually applied in very low concentrations e.g. in a<br>
range from 0.1 % to 2 %, while the necessary quantity of aqueous conveyor lubricant is high.<br>
The exact determination of concentration of the applied lubricants is of a high significance, in<br>
order to guarantee an optimal lubrication of the conveyor system.<br>
Presently the concentration of aqueous conveyor lubricants is determined by manually<br>
retaining a sample of the conveyor lubricant and examining it by titration. This method is<br>
very inaccurate, due to the difficult recognition of the equilibrium point during the titration.<br>
Furthermore, this analysis technique takes a long time to obtain results and is not adapted for<br>
an on-line application.<br>
The present invention seeks to avoid these disadvantages by proposing a technique of<br>
measuring by a spectro-photometric method, particularly by the absorbance of light, which is<br>
simpler, faster and easier to implement than the laboratory method discussed above.<br>
Furthermore, this method can be adapted to use on-line.<br>
Many molecules absorb ultraviolet or visible light. Lambert-Beer's Law is a<br>
mathematical means of expressing how light is absorbed by matter. The Law states that the<br>
amount of light emerging from a sample is diminished by three physical phenomena:<br><br>
1.	The amount of absorbing material in its path length (concentration)<br>
2.	The distance the light must travel through the sample (optical path length)<br>
3.	The probability that the photon of that particular wavelength will be absorbed<br>
by the material (absorptivity or extinction coefficient).<br>
This relationship may be expressed as:<br>
A = ebc<br>
were<br>
A = absorbance<br>
e = molar extinction coefficient<br>
b = path length in cm and<br>
c = molar concentration.<br>
Different molecules absorb radiation of different wavelength. An absorption spectrum<br>
will show a number of absorption bands corresponding to structural groups within a<br>
molecule. An absorption spectrum shows the absorption of light as a function of a<br>
wavelength.<br>
The determination of a concentration by measuring the absorption of light is a<br>
modern, reliable and competitive method, which is applied especially for industrial waste-<br>
water analysis.<br>
Examples for the concentration detection of a component of an industrial water<br>
system can be found in US 5,419,837 or in US 2004/013221 A. US 4,666,858 teaches the<br>
determination of the quantity of anionic material in electrolyte metal plating baths by spectro-<br>
photometrical measuring the ultraviolet absorption of the extracted material.<br><br>
DE-A1 42 34 466 is directed to a method for the determination of the concentration of<br>
a substance within a solution. This document teaches the use of a tracer, which is a<br>
fluorescence dye, the concentration of which is measured by an optical method.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of lubricating a conveyor<br>
system, which assures an optimal concentration of the applied lubricant.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to make a conveyor system more efficient<br>
by avoiding standing times and increasing its transport capacity. Another object of the present<br>
invention is to permit the on-line determination of the concentration of an aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant, which is applied to a conveyor system.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
These and other objects are achieved by the present invention, which comprises a<br>
method of lubricating a conveyor system comprising<br>
i)	irradiating an aqueous conveyor lubricant having a concentration c with<br>
light,<br>
ii) determining the concentration c of the aqueous conveyor lubricant by<br>
measuring the absorption of the light by the aqueous conveyor lubricant with an<br>
absorption detector and<br>
iii) applying the aqueous conveyor lubricant to the conveyor system.<br>
This automated procedure allows exact dosage of applied lubricants and the<br>
concentration measurement to be integrated directly into the lubrication process. The<br>
invention provides a secure lubrication process, avoiding unnecessary over-concentration of<br>
the lubricant and therefore avoiding high product costs. The concentration of the lubricant has<br>
to be observed e.g. if the aqueous conveyor lubricant is not stable or if the conveyor lubricant<br>
is diluted prior to application and the diluting process is not constant or reliable. Furthermore,<br>
if the tank containing the conveyor lubricant concentrate or the aqueous conveyor lubricant is<br>
nearly empty, the attention of an operator has to be called to the resulting drop in<br>
concentration. The conveyor lubrication system of the present application can be equipped<br>
with an alarm device, which raises an alarm signal if an unwanted concentration of the<br>
aqueous conveyor lubricant is determined.<br>
If the conveyor lubricant is delivered to the conveyor lubrication system in a<br>
concentrated form, the conveyor lubricant concentrate can be diluted with water to obtain an<br><br>
aqueous lubricant with a concentration c, before carrying out steps i) to iii) of the method<br>
according to the invention. If the conveyor lubricant is already delivered in the desired<br>
concentration c, this diluting step is not necessary.<br>
The present invention further refers to a conveyor lubrication system including an<br>
application device for applying an aqueous conveyor lubricant to a conveyor system. The<br>
conveyor lubrication system further includes a measuring device with a light source and with<br>
an absorption detector for measuring the absorption of light by the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant within the conveyor lubrication system.<br>
The present invention further refers to another conveyor lubrication system, including<br>
a dosing station and an application device, the dosing station containing at least one dosing<br>
pump for pumping a conveyor lubricant concentrate through a dosing pipe into at least one<br>
mixing space. The mixing space is attached to a water supply for diluting the conveyor<br>
lubricant concentrate with water within the mixing space to obtain an aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant. The mixing space is attached to at least one outlet pipe for transporting the aqueous<br>
conveyor lubricant out of the mixing space. The outlet pipe is leading to the application<br>
device for applying the aqueous conveyor lubricant to a conveyor system. The conveyor<br>
lubrication system further includes a measuring device with a light source and with an<br>
absorption detector for measuring the absorption of light by the aqueous conveyor lubricant<br>
within the conveyor lubrication system.<br>

Description of various and preferred embodiments<br>
The method of the present invention is concerned with lubricating a conveyor system.<br>
Conveyor systems are systems for transporting goods in industrial plants, comprising<br>
conveyor belts, conveyor bands, conveyor lines, tracks and the like.<br>
According to the proposed method, if the lubricant is available in a concentrated form,<br>
the conveyor lubricant concentrate is diluted with water to obtain an aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant. This dilution step of a concentrate is necessary, since the lubricant is applied to the<br>
conveyor system with a low concentration.<br>
Examples of conveyor lubricant concentrates and aqueous conveyor lubricants can be<br>
found in EP 0946 692 B1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This<br>
European patent refers to lubricants on the basis of soap, on the basis of fatty amines and on<br>
the basis of phosphate esters. The present invention is mainly directed to lubricants on the<br>
basis of amines and on the basis of soap and furthermore to lubricants on the basis of ether<br>
carboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably the conveyor lubricant concentrate is diluted with water to obtain an<br>
aqueous conveyor lubricant with a concentration c in a range from 0.05 to 2.5 %, particularly<br>
in a range from 0.1 % to 0.3 % referring to lubricants on the basis of amines, ether carboxylic<br>
acids or ethoxylate and particularly in a range from 0.5 to 2 % referring to lubricants on the<br>
basis of soap. All percentages referred to in this context are percentages by weight.<br>
If the aqueous conveyor lubricant is available with the desired concentration c, the<br>
diluting step is unnecessary.<br>
According to the present invention the aqueous conveyor lubricant is irradiated with<br>
light, the absorption of the light by the lubricant being measured with a light detector. For the<br>
irradiation a light source is used, preferably a light source selected from the group of a<br>
hydrogen lamp, a deuterium lamp, a laser and a tungsten lamp. Preferably the aqueous<br>
conveyor lubricant is irradiated with visible or ultraviolet light of one specific wavelength.<br><br>
This wavelength is advantageously the wavelength of an absorption peak of a component of<br>
the aqueous conveyor lubricant. If the used light source is a continuous light source, emitting<br>
light in a range of wavelength, the desired specific wavelength for irradiating the lubricant<br>
can be selected by a wavelength separator, e.g. a prism, a grating or a monochromator.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the absorption of<br>
light with a wavelength in a range from 200 to 300 nm is measured.<br>
The light from the light source is focused and sent into the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant within an element of the conveyor lubrication system, e.g. within a pipe or chamber<br>
of the dosing station. The emerging light, which has penetrated the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant is measured on the opposite side of the element by an absorption detector. The<br>
absorption detector includes for example a photo-electric cell, a photo-diode or a photo-<br>
multiplier. The detector is usually connected with an amplifier and a data processing unit.<br>
The measured absorbance is compared to a calibration curve (e.g. by the data processing unit)<br>
to determine the concentration of the lubricant. The calibration curve shows the absorbance<br>
as a function of the concentration for this aqueous lubricant (according to the Lambert-Beer-<br>
Law) at the chosen wave length and with the used set-up. The calibration curve has been<br>
determined by measuring the absorbance of the same lubricant of known concentrations with<br>
the same set-up.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the absorption of the<br>
light is measured on-line during operation of the conveyor system. Preferably the measured<br>
concentration values are used to control the application quantity of the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant. The on-line measurement of the concentration permits a fast response to unwanted<br>
concentration variations by varying the application quantity of lubricant to the conveyor<br>
system. Another possibility would be controlling the amount of water mixed with the<br>
conveyor lubricant concentrate or the amount of conveyor lubricant concentrate mixed with<br>
the water in the diluting step, depending on the determined concentration of the aqueous<br>
conveyor lubricant.<br>
According to the present invention, the aqueous lubricant is applied to the conveyor<br>
system. The conveyor system is automatically and continuously lubricated by a conveyor<br>
lubrication system according to the present invention.<br>
Preferably the aqueous conveyor lubricant is applied to the conveyor system by<br>
spraying, brushing or dipping. The spraying can be carried out by spraying nozzles, the<br><br>
brushing by brushes and the dipping by leading the conveyor band through dip trays, which<br>
contain the aqueous conveyor lubricant.<br>
The conveyor lubrication system preferably includes a dosing station and an<br>
application device. The dosing station doses the amount of conveyor lubricant concentrate<br>
and the amount of water, which are mixed in order to obtain the aqueous conveyor lubricant<br>
with a concentration c. The application device serves to apply the lubricant to the conveyor<br>
system, including for example spraying nozzles for a spray application. For measuring the<br>
absorption of light as described above, the conveyor lubrication system further contains a<br>
measuring device.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the measuring device<br>
of the conveyor lubrication system includes a flow cell, which is equipped with the light<br>
source and the absorption detector and which is connected to an element of the dosing station<br>
or the application device, the element containing the aqueous conveyor lubricant. The flow<br>
cell can be connected for example to a pipe or a mixing chamber of the dosing station or the<br>
application device, through which the aqueous conveyor lubricant is flowing during the<br>
operation of the conveyor lubrication system.<br>
Figure 1 represents absorbance spectra of different aqueous solutions containing<br>
components of conveyor lubricants, plotting absorbance A versus wavelength X.<br>
The absorbance spectra were measured by scanning a wavelength separator over the<br>
wavelength range from 200 nm to 300 nm. A first aqueous solution contained the component<br>
1, which was an alkyl (C16-18) ether (9 EO) carboxylic acid, with a concentration of 10 %.<br>
The absorbance spectrum of this aqueous solution with the component 1 shows an absorption<br>
maximum at about λ = 234 nm.<br>
A second aqueous solution contained the component 2, which was N-oleyl-1,3-<br>
diamino propane, with a concentration of 10 %. The absorbance spectrum of this aqueous<br>
solution with component 2 shows an absorption maximum at about λ = 220 nm.<br>
A third aqueous solution contained the component 3, which was oleylamine<br>
ethoxylate (12 EO), with a concentration of 2 %. The absorbance spectrum of this aqueous<br>
solution with the component 3 shows an absorption maximum at about λ = 234 nm.<br>
A fourth aqueous solution contained the component 4, which was N-coco-1,3-diamino<br>
propane, with a concentration of 10 %. The absorbance spectrum of this aqueous solution<br>
with the component 4 shows an absorption maximum at about λ = 220 nm.<br><br>
The four components 1 to 4 are typical components of aqueous conveyor lubricants.<br>
An optimum wavelength for an ultraviolet absorption detection using lubricants containing at<br>
least one of these components is the wavelength of the absorption peaks in Figure 1, i.e. 220<br>
nm or 234 nm.<br>

the aqueous conveyor lubricant is determined my measuring the absorption of ultraviolet light<br>

absorbance A was measured at a wavelength λ of 234 nm and with a path length d through<br>
the lubricant of 1 cm. The calibration curve shows a nice linearity of the absorbance as a<br>
function of the concentration. Therefore, a linear equation can be given (y = 0.7615x -<br>
0.0019). With the help of this equation the concentration c (x) can be calculated from a<br>
measured absorbance A (y) for this lubricant, at this wavelength with the absorbance<br>
measured with the same set-up.<br>
Figure 3 shows a plot of absorbance A versus concentration c at a wavelength λ of<br>
234 nm and with a path length d of 1 cm for a second aqueous conveyor lubricant. In this<br>
case, the lubricant was lubricant E from table 1.<br>
 Figures 4 and 5 show a plot of absorbance A versus concentration c at a wavelength λ <br>
of 220 nm and with a path length d of 1 cm for a third an fourth aqueous conveyor lubricant,<br>
which were lubricants A and J respectively, according to table 1. All of the lubricants listed in<br>
table 1 showed a similar linear correlation of the absorbance and the concentration, all of the<br>
calibration curves being measured at 220 nm or 234 nm.<br>
Furthermore, the influence of different water qualities (used for diluting the conveyor<br>
lubricant concentrates) and of product aging on the calibration curves was tested. Some of the<br>
calibration curves showed a minor dependency on these factors, which can be rated as being<br>
neglectable.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the conveyor lubricant<br>
concentrate contains a tracer with a known concentration, the concentration of the aqueous<br>
conveyor lubricant being determined by measuring the absorption of light with a specific<br>
wavelength being absorbed primarily by the tracer. When the conveyor lubricant concentrate<br><br>
is diluted, the tracer (with a known starting concentration) is diluted to the same degree. The<br>
tracer shows an absorption peak at a known wavelength. By measuring the absorbance of the<br>
aqueous conveyor lubricant with the diluted tracer at this wavelength, the concentration of the<br>
tracer and consequently the concentration of the conveyor lubricant can be determined. The<br>
tracer to be used in this context must be homogeneously distributable within the aqueous<br>
conveyor lubricant.<br>
Figure 6 shows an absorbance spectrum of a tracer, plotting the absorbance A versus<br>
the wavelength λ. The tracer (0.5 mg/L) shows a maximum of absorption at a wavelength of<br>
about 228 nm (path length d = 1 cm). The tracer used was a naphtaline sulphone acid<br>
derivate, which is commercially available.<br>
Figure 7 shows a plot of absorbance versus concentration at a wavelength of 228 nm<br>
for the lubricant G (Table 1), to which the tracer (0.1% referring to the conveyor lubricant<br>
concentrate) has been added.<br>
Figure 8 is a plot of the absorbance A versus the time t, being the result of an on-line<br>
measurement at a conveyor lubrication system. The absorbance of the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant varies with time, which means, that the concentration of the lubricant also varies.<br>
By controlling the application quantity of lubricant applied to the conveyor system by the<br>
conveyor lubrication system depending upon the determined concentration, a constant<br>
lubrication can be assured, counteracting the variations of concentrations of the aqueous<br>
lubricant.<br>
Figure 9 shows schematically one embodiment of a dosing station, which is part of a<br>
conveyor lubrication system according to the present invention.<br>
The dosing station 20 comprises dosing pumps 1 (attached to a power socket 7),<br>
which are connected to a suction pipe 11 via a pipe system 18. The suction pipe 11 is<br>
mounted within a tank (not shown) which contains a conveyor lubricant concentrate. The<br>
concentrate is pumped by the dosing pumps 1 through the suction pipe 11 via dosing pipes 12<br>
into four different mixing spaces 13. The mixing spaces 13 are each attached to a water<br>
supply (not shown) the water being led through water pipes 14. The water pipes 14 are<br>
connected to a main water pipe 15. The main water pipe 15 further contains a main regulating<br>
valve 17, a water filter 10 and a disconnecting part 9. The main water pipe 15 meets the four<br>
water pipes 14 at the branching 16. Next to each branching 16 each water pipe 14 contains a<br>
regulating valve 5 and a pressure measuring device 8 with a pressure reducing regulator 4.<br>
Within each water pipe 14 a water meter 2 is installed. The water pipes 14 meet the dosing<br><br>
pipes 12 at dosing valves 3, which control the amount of conveyor lubricant concentrate to be<br>
added to the water. The lubricant concentrate and the water are mixed within the mixing<br>
spaces 13, obtaining an aqueous conveyor lubricant, which flows through outlet pipes 19 to<br>
the application device (not shown) for the application to a conveyor system. The electronical<br>
parts of the dosing station 20 are placed in housings 6. With the four different water pipes 14<br>
and the four different dosing pipes 12, four different concentrations of the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant can be mixed and led to four different conveyor systems or alternately to one<br>
conveyor system.<br>
The conveyor lubrication system further includes a measuring device 21, which is<br>
shown schematically in Figure 9. The measuring device includes a light source and an<br>
absorption detector for measuring the absorption of light by the aqueous conveyor lubricant.<br>
The measuring device 21 can be positioned anywhere within the conveyor lubrication system,<br>
where the system contains the readily mixed aqueous conveyor lubricant (starting from the<br>
mixing spaces 13 and previous to the location where the lubricant is applied to the conveyor).<br>
The measuring device can be installed in such a way, that the aqueous conveyor lubricant<br>
flowing through the pipes of the system is measured directly within these pipes or that part of<br>
the aqueous conveyor lubricant is lead through a bypass, the lubricant being analyzed by the<br>
measuring device 21 within this bypass. By way of example the measuring device 21 is shown<br>
schematically in figure 9, attached to one outlet pipe 19, the aqueous conveyor lubricant<br>
being analyzed by the measuring device 21 within the outlet pipe 19 through light<br>
transmitting windows (e.g. of a flow cell), or attached to a bypass 22, the aqueous conveyor<br>
lubricant being analyzed by the measuring device 21 within the bypass 22 through light<br>
transmitting windows (e.g. of a flow cell).<br><br>
