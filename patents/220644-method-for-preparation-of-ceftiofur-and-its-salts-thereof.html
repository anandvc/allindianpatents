"An Improved Method for Preparation, of Ceftiofur  and its salts thereof"<br>
Lupin   Limited,   159   CST   Road,   Kalina,   Santacruz   (East),   Mumbai   -   400   098, Maharashtra, India<br>
This invention particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
AN  IMPROVED  METHOD  FOR PREPARATION  OF  CEFTIOFUR AND SALTS THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved method for preparation of ceftiofur and its salts of formula (I),<br><br>

7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl) glyoxylamido] 3-(mercaptomethyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-l-azabicyclo-[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, of formula (la), generically known as ceftiofur<br><br><br>

are valuable antibiotics for veterinary use, specially for treatment of infections in bovine animals.<br>
The synthesis of ceftiofur (la) and ceftiofur sodium (lb) has been achieved the following ways:<br>
1.        US Patent No. 4,464,367, which covers ceftiofur and ceftiofur sodium, discloses<br>
two methods for preparation of ceftiofur, which comprises:<br>
i)	reaction of 7-amino-cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) with (tritylamino-2-<br>
thiazolyl-4)-2-methoxyimino-2-acetic     acid	in     presence     of<br>
diccyclohexylcarbodiimide and hydroxy- 1-benzotriazole, followed by reaction of the 7-acylated cephalosporanic acid thus obtained, with thiofuroic acid, followed by  removal of the trityl protective group by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to give ceftiofur (la) as summarized in Scheme-I <br>
This method is not only uneconomical but also poses serious safety hazards since it utilizes expensive and toxic dicyclohexylcarbodiimide for the coupling step and corrosive trifluoroacetic acid for removal of the amino protective group. Moreover, the by-product formed in the reaction, viz. dicyclohexyl urea is not easily removed requiring, more often than not tedious and elaborate purification methods.<br>
ii)        reaction   of   7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino    acetamido]<br>
cephalosporanic acid, generically known as cefotaxime of formula (IV)<br>
with thiofuroic acid to give ceftiofur (la) as summarized in Scheme-II.<br>
The  conversion of cefotaxime to  ceftiofur,  which  involves  nucleophilic<br>
displacement of the acetoxy substituent (-OCOCH3)   at 3a-position of the former<br>
compound with a thiofuroyl group (-S-CO-C4H3O) can be carried out in the presence<br>
of an acid or in the presence of a base<br>
3<br><br>
 Substitution of an acetoxy function (-OCOCH3) by a thiofuroyl group (-S-CO-C4H3O) can be achieved through a SN1 or SN2 reaction but the success of these reactions strictly depends on various parameters. In the case of cephalosporin compounds, such a SN1 or SN2 reaction is highly dependent on the pH of the reaction i. e. whether it is carried out in the presence of an acid or a base, the medium of reaction, temperature of reaction etc.<br>
However, apart from a cursory mention of the abovementioned reaction sequence summarized in Scheme-II, the US Patent No. 4,464,367 neither provides any detail whatsoever nor any enabling conditions for preparation of ceftiofur from cefotaxime, either through an example or description.<br>
Whatever is mentioned is nothing but a conjecture with no evidence whatsoever to substantiate the conjecture, which would be evident from the discussion in the later part of this specification.<br>

Patent No. 4,464,367<br>
Further, the thiofuroyl substituent at 3a-position of the product i. e. ceftiofur is very vulnerable to acidic as well as basic conditions resulting in hydrolysis of furoyl group to give thiol (-SH) derivative at the 3a-position as well as formation of divalent sulfur derivatives. This makes it very difficult to effect a successful SN1 or SN2 substitution at the 3a-position of cefotaxime to obtain ceftiofur substantially free of the thiol compound and the divalent sulfur derivatives.<br>
The problem is further compounded by the presence of the 2-[(2-amino thiazol-4-yl)-methoxyimino]acetamido addendum at the 7-position, which is also highly susceptible to cleavage under acidic and basic conditions to give the corresponding 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-free amino derivative.<br>
6<br><br>
The US Patent No. 4,464,367 further states that mineral salts of the corresponding acids are obtained by action on the free acid of formula (la) with a mineral base such as NaOH or KOH or NaHCO3 in equimolar quantity; the salification reaction is effected in a solvent such as water or ethanol and the salt obtained is isolated by evaporation of the solution.<br>
However, there is no enabling disclosure in the patent specification for methods for preparation of ceftiofur sodium.<br>
2.	US Patent No. 4,937,330 describes a method for preparation of ceftiofur<br>
sodium of high purity comprising the steps of:<br>
i)	conversion of ceftiofur to  a crystalline -ceftiofur hydrohalide salt,<br>
specially the hydrochloride salt, <br>
ii)        neutralization of the crystalline hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur, specially<br>
the hydrochloride salt thus obtained by treatment with a basic resin eg.<br>
polyvinyl pyridine in an aqueous organic solvent, <br>
iii)	removal of the basic resin from the reaction mixture by filtration, and <br>
iv)       treating the filtrate containing the neutralised compound i. e. ceftiofur<br>
            with a base of a sodium metal carrier to give ceftiofur sodium. <br>
However, this method is not only lengthy and less cost-effective since it involves the step of formation of a hydrochloride salt and its subsequent neutralization and utilization of expensive resins like polyvinyl pyridine.<br>
3.	US Patent No. 6,458,949 describes a process for preparation of ceftiofur sodium<br>
and   its   intermediates   comprising   reaction   of  silylated   7-amino—3-(2-<br>
furylcarbonylthiomethyl) -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (furaca) with 4-halo-2-<br>
methoxyimino-3-oxobutyryl   halide   to   give   an   intermediate,   which   on<br>
cyclization with thiourea gives ceftiofur as summarized in Scheme-III.<br>
However, this method involves a total of 6 steps, of which 4 steps are involved<br>
to prepare the 4-halo-2-methoxyimino-3-oxobutyryl halide intermediate, making it<br>
lengthy and tedious. Moreover, the yields reported are low rendering the process<br>
commercially not very attractive.<br>

No. 6,458,949<br>
Displacement of a functional group at of 3a-position of a cephalosporin<br>
derivative to give a 3-thiomethyl derivative is known in the art. Notable among<br>
such methods are:<br>
i)	the one disclosed in US Patent No.    4,312,986 for a process for<br>
producing a 7-(substituted)-amino-3-substituted thiomethyl-D3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid derivative of the formula (II) comprising,<br><br><br>

reaction of the compound of general formula (III),<br>

wherein Ri is a hydrogen atom or a CM alkoxy group; R2 inter alia is essentially an amino group and X is a leaving group with a thiol compound of formula Rs-SH, where Rs is a thiol compound residue, in an organic solvent in the presence of a Bronsted acid, or a Lewis acid or complex compound of Lewis acid other than BF3. the one disclosed in US Patent No. 4,476,220 for ^preparation of 7-amino-3- (2-furanylcarbonylthiomethyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid starting from 7-amino cephalosporanic acid and thiofuroic acid, by nucleophillic substitution of the acetoxy function at 3-position of the cephalosporin nucleus in (II) with a thiofuroyl function, as shown hereinbelow.<br><br><br><br><br>

V<br><br>
BF3 Etherate/Ethyl acetate<br><br>
This displacement reaction is carried out in the presence of boron trifluoride in ethyl acetate. Since boron trifluoride is a gas, and hazardous in nature, it requires special handling precautions on an industrial scale.<br>
However, the above patents essentially teach the functionalisation at 3-position of compounds of formula (II) and 7-ACA, which have a free amino group at 7-position of the cephalosporin nucleus. There is, however, no suggestion that 7-acylamino cephalosporins, specially those carrying a 2-aminothiazoylyl acetamido moiety at the 7-position could be reacted with a thiol compound, Rs-SH, in the presence of Bronsted acids or Lewis acids, to give the corresponding 7-(2-aminothiazolyl)- acetamido-3-substituted thiol derivative.<br>
Further, Bronsted acids or Lewis acids are known to effect the cleavage of the amide bond at 7-position of cephalosporins. Incidentally, US Patent No. 5,132,419 relates to a process for preparation of 7-amino-3- [(Z)-l-propen-l-yi]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid of formula (V), by reaction of the corresponding 7-acyl amino derivative of formula (IV), wherein the cleavage of the amide bond at 7-position is effected by utilization of a Bronsted acid or Lewis acid. The chemistry is summarized hereibelow,<br><br><br>

Lewis Acid<br><br>
&gt;<br><br>
H2lsk<br><br><br><br>
(IV)<br><br>
(V)<br><br>
wherein Ri and R2 represents alkyl, aryl and aralkyl radicals, either identical or different.<br>
Incidentally, the above fact was substantiated by the present inventors when in their attempts to convert cefotaxime to cefliofur in the presence of a Lewis acid like Boron trifluoride etherate, the 7-deacylated derivative of cefotaxime i. e. 7-ACA was the major product, with very little conversion to cefliofur observed.<br>
From the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that:<br>
10<br><br>
a)	while displacement of a functional group at of 3a-position of a cephalosporin derivative by reaction with a thiol compound in the presence of a Bronsted acid or a Lewis acid to give the corresponding 3-thiomethyl derivative is achieved, when the 7-amino function is unsubstituted i. e. is free;<br>
b)	the corresponding displacement of a functional group at of 3a-position of a cephalosporin derivative, wherein the 7-amino function is substituted i. e. carrying an acylamino function by reaction with a thiol compound in the presence of a Bronsted acid or a Lewis acid would be expected to lead to substantial cleavage of the 7-acylamino function or the amide bond to give the respective starting compounds with a free 7-amino group, with little or no displacement reaction taking place at the 3a-position.<br>
Against this backdrop, reaction of compound of formula ((III), wherein the 7-amino function is substituted, specially with a 2-aminothiazolyl acetic acid moiety with the thiol compound, Rg-SH in the presence of a Bronsted acid or a Lewis acid would be expected to cleave the amide bond at 7-position leading to formation of the deacylated products, with little or no displacement reaction taking place at the 3a-position.<br>
Indeed, the present inventors found it to be true when 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino acetamido] cephalosporanic acid i.e. cefotaxime or its salts or its easily hydrolysable esters of formula (VI),<br><br>
H2N<br>
OR3<br><br>
CH3<br><br>
(VI)<br><br>
wherein R3 is hydrogen, an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or an easily hydrolysable ester, is reacted with thiofuroic acid, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium chloride; boron trifluoride; zinc halides such as zinc chloride and zinc bromide; tin halides such as stannic chloride and stannic bromide; or the complex compounds of these Lewis acids with dialkyl ethers, amines, fatty acids, nitriles, carboxylic esters and phenols etc. very little displacement at the 3a-position took place and the reaction led<br>
11<br><br>
to formation of predominant amounts of the 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-ACA and unidentified impurities. Ceftiofur of formula (I) formed in the reaction was only between 5-15% and could not be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
Similarly, when instead of a Lewis acid, the abovementioned reaction was carried out in the presence of a Bronsted acid like hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, super acids such as perchloric acid, magic acid (FSO3H-SbF5), FSO3H-AsF5, CF3SO3-H-SbF5, H2SO4-SO3, chloro sulfuric acid, fluoro sulfuric acid, etc. the same phenomena was observed i. e. very little displacement at the 3a-position took place and the reaction led to formation of predominant amounts of the 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-ACA, and unidentified impurities. Ceftiofur of formula (I) formed in the reaction was only between 5-20% and could not be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
Further, carrying out the abovementioned reaction in the presence of a mixture of Bronsted acid and a Lewis acid was also found to result in predominant amounts of the 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-ACA and impurities and here again whatever ceftiofur formed in the reaction could not be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
The above conversion, hence, has no commercial application, except may be of some academic interest.<br>
Against this backdrop, it was with surprising effect that the present inventors found that the reaction of 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino acetamido] cephalosporanic acid i.e. cefotaxime or its salts or its easily hydrolysable esters of formula (VI), wherein R3 is hydrogen, an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or an easily hydrolysable ester,<br><br>

between 40 % to 70% when the said reaction is carried out in the presence of either methanesulfonic acid or sulfuric acid.<br>
However, again to their surprise the present inventors found that while the reaction of ceftotaxime with thiofuroic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid indicated a conversion of between 40 to 55% to ceftiofur, and formation of impurities in the range of between 8 to 40%, however, no product could be isolated from the reaction mixture, in spite of employing various isolation methods.<br>
A dramatic change was found when methanesulfonic acid was used as the Bronsted acid instead of sulfuric acid. Not only a conversion of between 50 to 70% was achieved, but most importantly, ceftiofur could be indeed be isolated from the reaction mixture in substantially large amounts and surprisingly the isolated product was found to possess high stability, high purity of more than 97% and found to be substantially free of impurities.<br>
More surprising was the finding that though methanesulfonic acid gives a commercially viable conversion of cefotaxime to ceftiofur conforming to pharmacopoeia specification, other organic sulfonic acids like benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid etc. failed miserably to give a viable process.<br>
The yield and quality of ceftiofur and formation of impurities in the abovementioned reaction was also found with surprising effect to be highly dependent on the amount of methanesulfonic acid employed, the amount of thiofuroic acid employed, the medium and temperature of reaction. The selection of the molar proportions of methanesulfonic acid, the medium of reaction and the temperature of reaction in providing ceftiofur (la) in large isolable yields and high purity, therefore forms the basis of the present invention.<br>
13<br><br>
It was found that ceftiofur of formula (la) and ceftiofur sodium of formula (lb)<br>
could be obtained in isolable yields of between 20% to 25% possessing high storage<br>
stability and having purity more than 97% and substantially free of impurities through<br>
a selection of parameters in the reaction of 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-<br>
methoxyimino acetamido] cephalosporanic acid i.e. cefotaxime or its salts or its easily<br>
hydrolysable esters of formula (VI) with thiofuroic acid, the selection being utilization<br>
of:<br>
i)	not a catalytic amount but   a large excess of methanesulfonic acid in molar<br>
proportions of 12-18 moles per mole of compound of formula (VI),<br>
ii)	an excess of thiofuroic acid in molar proportions of 1.5 to 3.0 moles per mole<br>
of compound of formula (VI),<br>
iii)       specifically acetonitrile as the medium of reaction, and<br>
iv)	a reaction  temperature in the range of between -5 °C to 30 °C, preferably<br>
between 10 °C to 30 °C, and more preferably between 15°C to 25°C.<br>
It was further found that the ceftiofur (la) thus obtained could be converted to tis sodium salt i. e. ceftiofur sodium of formula (lb), again possessing high storage stability and having purity more than 97% and substantially free of impurities through a selective method comprising double decomposition of a salt of ceftiofur with an organic amine with a sodium metal carrier and isolation of ceftiofur sodium from the reaction mixture through a solvent precipitation method.<br>
Preparation of ceftiofur sodium (lb) of high storage stability and having purity more than 97% and substantially free of impurities from cefotaxime (VI), via the intermediacy of ceftiofur (la), forms the basis of another aspect of the present invention.<br>
The ceftiofur (la) and its sodium salt (lb), thus obtained by virtue of their high purity and stability are found to be highly suitable for formulation into suitable dosage forms.<br>

completion of reaction the product i.e. ceftiofur of formula (la) is isolated by conventional methods, after neutralisation of the alkali or alkaline earth metal salts or removal of carboxylic acid protecting group, if any.<br>
By easily hydrolysable esters of the compounds of formula (VI) there are to be understood compounds of the formula (VI) in which the carboxyl group is present in the form of an ester group which can be easily hydrolysed. Examples of such esters, which can be of the conventional type, are the lower alkanoyloxyalkyl esters, e.g., the acetoxy methyl, pivaloxymethyl, 1-acetoxyethyl, 1-pivaloxyethyl ester; the lower alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, e.g., the methoxycarbonyloxymethyl, 1-ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and 1-isopropoxycarbonyloxyethyl ester, the alkoxymethyl esters, e.g., methoxy methyl ester, and the lower alkylaminomethyl esters, e.g., the acetamidomethyl esters. Other esters, e.g. the benzyl and cyanomethyl esters can also be used.<br>
Alkali metals are selected from sodium, potassium, lithium and cesium, while the alkali earth metals are selected from magnesium and calcium.<br>

Selection of Methanesulfonic acid as the Bronsted acid<br>
As mentioned hereinearlier, when 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino acetamido] cephalosporanic acid i.e. cefotaxime or its salts or its easily hydrolysable esters of formula (VI) was reacted with thiofuroic acid, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium chloride; boron trifluoride, zinc halides such as zinc chloride and zinc bromide; tin halides such as stannic chloride and stannic bromide or. the complex compounds of these Lewis acids with dialkyl ethers, amines, fatty acids, nitriles, carboxylic esters and phenols etc. very little displacement at the 3a-position took place and the reaction led to formation of predominant amounts of the . 7-deacylated<br>
19<br><br>
derivative i. e. 7-ACA, and impurities. Ceftiofur of formula (I) formed in the reaction was only between 5-15% and could not be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
Similarly, when instead of a Lewis acid, the abovementioned reaction was carried out in the presence of a Bronsted acid like hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, super acids such as perchloric acid, magic acid (FSO3H-SbF5), FSO3H-ASF5, CF3SO3-H-SbF5, H2SO4-SO3, chloro sulfuric acid, fluoro sulfuric acid, etc. the same phenomena was observed i. e. very little displacement at the 3a-position took place and the reaction led to formation of predominant amounts of the 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-ACA, and unidentified impurities. Ceftiofur of formula (I) formed in the reaction was only between 5-20% and could not be isolated from the reaction mixture.<br>
In particular, when sulfuric acid was employed as the Bronsted acid in various molar proportions in the reaction of cefotaxime (VI) with thiofuroic acid in the presence of different solvents and at different temperatures, although the reaction inter alia was found to be slow, leading to conversion of ceftiofur of between 40% to 55% with concurrent formation of impurities in large amounts, no isolation of the product was possible even after utilizing various isolation methods.<br>
On the other hand, when methanesulfonic acid is used the conversion to ceftiofur is found be more than 50%, specially in the range of 55-70%.<br>
Further, by increasing the acidity by carrying out the abovementioned reaction in a mixture of methanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid or in the presence of methanesulfonic acid with a Lewis acid like zinc chloride was also found to result in predominant amounts of the 7-deacylated derivative i. e. 7-ACA, and impurities, again leading to no isolable product.<br>
A comparison of the results obtained using various Lewis and Bronsted acids is summarized in Table-I.<br>
 Selection of the Molar Proportion of Methanesulfonic acid<br>
When methanesulfonic acid was employed in a molar proportion of 6 moles per mole of compound (VI) the reaction was found to be slow with about 49% of the starting material i. e. cefotaxime (VI) was found left unreacted. Likewise, when methanesulfonic acid was employed in a molar proportion of 8 moles per mole of compound (VI) about 15% of the starting material was found left unreacted, even after<br>
20<br><br>
prolonged reaction time. Further, the product i. e. ceftiofur could not be isolated from the reaction mixture in both the cases.<br>
When a large excess of methanesulfonic acid was employed in a molar proportion of 12-18 moles per mole of compound (VI) the reaction was found to proceed to completion with conversion to ceftiofur in the range of 55-70% and resulting in its isolation in a yield of 20-25%, with a purity of more than 97%.<br>
This clearly shows that the role of methanesulfonic acid is not catalytic and the conversion requires a large excess of the acid to employed to obtain ceftiofur in isotable yields. Further, ceftiofur is obtained in isolable yields only when the molar proportion of methanesulfonic acid employed is more than 12 Moles, while anything below like utilization of 10 Moles, 8 Moles etc. no product could be isolated.<br>
Selectivity of the molar proportions of the Bronsted acid in the method of the present invention is summarized in Table-II.<br>

Selection of the medium of reaction<br>
Although, any inert organic solvent which does not participate in the reaction can be employed, it was particularly found that only acetonitrile gives an optimum conversion to ceftiofur of more than 50%, in particular in the range of 55-70%.<br>
When other inert solvents such as sulfolane, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, ethyl acetate etc.   are employed, the reaction was   either found not to proceed to completion or resulted in formation of higher level of impurities, with very little isolable amounts of ceftiofur.<br>
The selectivity of acetonitrile over other inert solvents in providing optimum conversion to ceftiofur is summarized in Table-III.<br>
 Selection of the temperature of reaction<br>
The reaction can typically be carried out at temperatures ranging from -30 °C to 30 °C. The preferred temperature for achieving optimum conversion to ceftiofur (la) is between 10 °C to 30 °C.<br>
The effect of temperature in optimum conversion to ceftiofur is summarized in<br>
Table-IV.	'      "<br>
Normally it would be expected that carrying out the reaction at lower temperatures would favour facile conversion with formation of lesser amount of impurities. However, the results obtained and summarized in Table-IV indicate that there is very little conversion at a low temperature of between 0° C to 5° C and formation of impurities is more than 70%. Similarly, when the temperature is high between 40° C to 45° C, again there is very little conversion to ceftiofur with more than 70% impurities formed.<br>
The most optimum temperature is between 10° C to 30° C and more preferably between 25° C to 30° C.<br>

Thiofuroic acid can be employed in equimolar to excess of equimolar proportions of compound (VI). However, it is preferable to employ a slight excess of thiofuroic acid, preferably in a molar proportion of 1.5 to 3 moles per mole of the compound (VI);<br>
In a typical method, to a solution of cefotaxime in acetonitrile cooled to 0-5° C is added methanesulfonic acid, followed by thiofuroic acid and the temperature raised to 10-30° C and the mixture agitated till completion of reaction, wherein the solid precipitates out.<br>
Ceftiofur acid (la) thus produced can be isolated by conventional methods as described in US Patent No. 4,464,367 or US Patent No. 6,458,949.<br>
However, it is preferably isolated by filtration of-the precipitated solid and washing the solid, thus obtained with a water-immiscible organic solvent selected from CM esters of acetic acid, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, iso-butyl acetate, or tert-butyl acetate and adjusting the pH of the mixture to 3.0 to 3.5 by addition of aqueous HC1. The precipitate thus obtained is again washed with a mixture of water-miscible and water- immiscible organic solvent, followed by pH adjustment to about 7.0 by aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The aqueous and organic layers are separated and the solid is precipitated by addition of a non-polar solvent and collected by filtration and dried.<br>
The water-miscible organic solvents that can be used are selected from acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol and ethanol.<br>
The non-polar solvents that can be used are selected from n-hexane, heptane, cyclohexane and toluene.<br>
The ceftiofur (la), obtained by the present method has the following characteristics<br><br>
Purity	97-99%<br>
Total Impurities	3.0-3.5%<br>
Storage Stability	Stable for 90 days at 40° ± 2° C with a drop in assay from 97% to 92%<br>

Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for conversion of ceftiofur (la) thus obtained to the sodium salt i. e ceftiofur sodium of formula (lb) in high yield , having high storage stability, having a purity of more than 97% and substantially free of impurities, through a selective, process described hereinbelow.<br>
The ceftiofur acid (la), thus obtained is suspended in a mixture of water-miscible organic solvent and water, at a temperature, ranging between -10 °C to 10 °C and treated with an organic amine to obtain a solution of the salt of ceftiofur with the organic amine.<br>
The amine salt thus obtained can be isolated, but preferably without isolation is reacted with a sodium metal carrier to give ceftiofur sodium of formula (lb), which can be isolated by precipitation by addition of more amounts of the water-miscible organic solvent used. The method for preparation of ceftiofur sodium is shown hereinbelow.<br>
Organic amines that can be used in the invention are selected from triethyl amine, diethyl amine, cyclohexyl amine, tertiary butyl amine, benzyl amine and the like. The organic amines are employed in molar proportions of 1.0 to 3.0 moles per mole of ceftiofur (la). Preferably they are employed in molar proportions of 1.2 to 1.5 moles per mole of ceftiofur (la).<br>
The water-miscible organic solvents that can be used are selected from acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol and ethanol.<br>
Sodium metal carriers that can be employed can be either organic or inorganic These are selected from sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bi carbonate, sodium ethoxide, sodium-2-ethyl hexanoate, sodium acetate, sodium propionate or sodium salt of 2-ethylcaproic acid<br>
The product is isolated by precipitation through addition of excess of the water-miscible organic solvent into the reaction mixture.<br>
In a typical method, to a suspension of ceftiofur (la) in a mixture of the water-miscible organic solvent and water cooled to -10 °C to 10 °C is added the organic base and the reaction mixture agitated for 30-45 minutes. The mixture treated with activated carbon and sodium dithionate and filtered.<br>
To the filtrate is added a solution of the sodium metal carrier in the water-miscible organic solvent and the precipitated solid was collected by filtration to give ceftiofur sodium (lb).<br>
27<br><br>
The ceftiofur sodium (lb), obtained by the present method has the following characteristics<br><br>
Purity	97-99%<br>
Total Impurities	2.0-2.5%<br>
Storage Stability	Stable for 90 days at 40° ± 2° C with a drop in assay from 94 to 87%<br>
Both the ceftiofur acid (la) and ceftiofur sodium (lb) obtained by the process of the present invention by virtue of having high storage stability and purity of more than 97% are highly amenable for formulation into stable dosage forms.<br>

Preparation of ceftiofur sodium (lb) from 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl) glyoxylamido] 3-<br>
(mercaptomethyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-l-azabicyclo-[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic	acid<br>
(Ceftiofur, la)<br>
1000 ml of THF and 70.0 ml of demineralised water (DMW) and l00.0g (0.191 moles) of 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl) glyoxylamido] 3-(mercaptomethyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo- [4.2.0] oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid (ceftiofur, la) were taken in a flask and stirred for 5 minutes. The mixture was cooled to -5 °C and 20.47 g (0.202 moles) of triethyl amine (TEA) was added at -5 to -3 °C in 60 minutes. Activated carbon (15g) and sodium dithionite (l.0g) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at -5 to 0 °C for 60 minutes. The mixture was filtered through celite bed and washed with a<br>
31<br><br>
mixture of THF and DMW (5:0.3v/v; 530 mL). The filtrate was passed through 0.2 n filter paper and washed with THF (100 ml).<br>
A solution of sodium-2-ethyl hexanoate (50.78g, 0.305 moles) was prepared in THF and passed through 0.2 \x filter paper. This filtrate was added gradually to the solution of triethylamine salt of ceftiofur, obtained above and the mixture was stirred at at 8-10 °C for 60 minutes and the precipitated solid filtered under nitrogen atmosphere. The wet cake was slurry washed with THF (500 mL), followed by ethyl acetate (2X500 ml) and acetone (3X500 ml). The wet cake was dried under nitrogen atmosphere for 30-45 minutes with occasional raking. The semi dry cake was dried in vacuum oven at 700mmHg/40°C to give 88 g (0.88 % w/w) of ceftiofur sodium (lb), having a purity of 98%.<br>
