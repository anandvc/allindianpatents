Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel organic amine salts of l-[[[(lR)-l-[3-<br>
[(lE)-2
 <br>
Formula-1<br>
Further more the present invention relates to the process for the preparation of<br>
pure     l-[[[(lR)-l-[3-[(lE)-2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(l-hydroxy-l-<br>
methylethyl)phenyl]     propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic    acid	sodium    salt<br>
(montelukast sodium) compound of formula-2,<br><br>
Formula-2 Montelukast sodium is a leukotriene D4 antagonist, montelukast sodium is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients. It is also indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and for perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and pediatric patients, montelukast sodium salt is available in a number of oral formulations including tablets, chewable tablets and oral granules.<br>
Bacl^round of the Invention<br>
EP 480717 discloses a process for the synthesis of montelukast and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts especially sodium. The process for the preparation comprises of reacting [(E)]-2-(2-(2-(3(S)-(3-(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)phenyl)-3-(methanesulfonyloxy) propyl)phenyl)-2-propoxy) tetrahydropyran with methyl 1-(acetylthiomethyl) cyclopropane acetate in presence of hydrazine^ cesium carbonate in<br><br>
acetonitrile as a solvent to get methyl ester of montelukast in pyran protected form. The protected compound is further reacted with pyridinium p-toluene sulfonate, sodium hydroxide in a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofliran as a solvent to afford montelukast sodium of Formula-2.<br>
US 5,614,632 disclose the preparation of l-(mercapto methyl) cyclopropane acetic acid, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of montelukast sodium. The said patent claimed an improved process for the preparation of montelukast sodium including the process for the preparation of its key intermediates. The process comprises, the generation of dilithium dianion of l-(mercaptomethyl) cyclopropaneacetic acid and then condensation with [(E)]-2-(2-(2-(3(S)-(3"(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)phenyl)-3 -(methanesulfonyloxypropyl)phenyl)-2-propanol (referred as mesylated alcohol) to afford the montelukast. It is further converted to its corresponding sodium salt via dicyclohexyl amine salt. The patent also discloses the process for the preparation of mesylated alcohol, which comprises reacting methyl 2-(3 (S)-(3"(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)phenyl)-3-hydroxy propyl) benzoate with methyl magnesium chloride to give diol, which is further converted to mesylated alcohol on reaction with methane sulphonyl chloride. The process for the preparation of above described benzoate is disclosed in EP 480717 (example 146, step-2).<br>
Further the main drawback of the prior art processes is that it describes a process for preparation of montelukast sodium via the dicyclohexylamine salt which needs to be further purified before conversion to the sodium salt. The dicyclohexylamine salt is highly hygroscopic in nature which leads to problems in isolation of the product. The hygroscopic nature of these salts results in powder handling issues at various stages, for example during filtration, isolation, drying and formulation, thereby limiting the scope for achieving high purity and industrial applicability.<br>
It was the aim of the present invention to develop an improved process for preparation of montelukast that would provide pure substance possessing high advantageous physico-chemical properties, high degree of crystallinity and thermodynamic stability, and therefore having appropriate processing parameters facilitating its formulation into the pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br><br>
The aim of the invention has been achieved by obtaining novel organic amine sahs of montelukast.<br>
