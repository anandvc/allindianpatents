PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the ladder type of frames used for multi utility vehicles. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved structure for closed channel structural member, such as cross member, for use in such a vehicle body &amp; frame assembly to increase strength &amp; rigidity. Ladder types of frames are used in vehicles in which body is mounted on frame assembly and the frame is mounted on resilient suspension system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
A multi utility rear wheel driven vehicle chassis frame includes a dedicated assembly cross member for supporting drive shaft "Centre bearing assembly". A drive shaft is a connecting member between transmission gear box and rear axle, through which torque is transmitted from engine to road wheels via differential. Cross member further provides increased torsional and lateral stiffness to the chassis frame against the loads commonly encountered by a vehicle during operation. This cross member acts as medium, for transferring drive line vibrations to cab, through cab mounting brackets attached to the frame. Hence care to be taken while designing centre bearing cross member such that, it isolates objectionable vibration from originating from driveline.<br>
The structures of the known body and frame assemblies can be divided in to two general categories, namely, separate and unitized. In a typical separate body and frame assembly, the structural components of body portion and frame portion of the vehicle are separate and independent from one another. When assembled, the frame portion of the assembly is resiliently supported upon the vehicle wheels by the suspension system and serves as platform upon which the body portion of the assembly and other components of the vehicle can be mounted. Separate body and<br><br>
frame assemblies of this general type are found in most older vehicles ,but remains in common use today for large multi utility vehicle's, sport utility vehicles, vans. Typical ladder type frame construction includes two assembly side long members supported by more than two cross member's based on requirement of strength, application, weight consideration and safety consideration.<br>
Traditionally, the centre bearing cross members of Multi Utility vehicle chassis frame assemblies have been formed with either open channel or uniform tubular cross section. However use of open and tubular section cross member in chassis frame assemblies has been found to be undesirable for several reasons, like lack of strength, rigidity, and also from NVH view. Vehicles with such cross members have high in Cab noise (Boom noise) and floor vibrations due to transfer of drive line vibration from chassis frame to Cab.<br>
To address this problem, it has been proposed to form one or more components and design a closed channel structural member's with hat cross section at the joinery location. This cross sectional shape is advantageous because it provides strength and rigidity to vehicle body and frame assembly.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a structural member for vehicle comprising an upper longitudinal member having open channel cross sectional shape with flanges, a lower longitudinal plate, lateral ends of said longitudinal plate connected to flanges of said upper longitudinal member.<br>
This invention relates to an improved closed channel structural member, such as cross member for use in frame assembly to increase strength and rigidity used for mounting of drive shaft centre bearing. This cross member reduces the point mobility of frame to maximum extent when compared with tubular section cross<br><br>
member. The cross member section is gradually increased towards the end where it is connected to long-member by plug welding process. Main cross member is of hat section closed by plain sheet metal boxing plate. Boxing plate is welded to cross member with spot welding. Such cross member can be used for supporting drive shaft centre bearing, which is medium of transferring driveline vibrations to cab. Such cross members are deigned to isolate objectionable vibration from originating from driveline.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the complete assembly frame sketch used for a multi utility vehicle .The frame assembly has many cross member assemblies serving different purposes. In this detailed description we will be briefing on parts that are necessary for complete understanding of this invention. The illustrated vehicle frame assembly 11 is a ladder type frame assembly which includes a pair of long members 12 &amp; 13 which are generally parallel to each other through out length.<br>
Cross members (15, 15a to 15g) attached between the long members (12 &amp; 13) thus gives a ladder type appearance. The cross members (15, 15a to 15g) extended perpendicular to the long members are spaced apart from one another and secured to the long members 12 and 13 by any conventional means such as by welding, riveting or bolting. For a typical MUV frame all the cross members are welded to long members 12 and 13.<br>
The cross members (15, 15a to 15g) provides desirable lateral and torsional rigidity to the frame. A plurality of body mounting brackets 14 are secured to the long members by welding. The cab is mounted on the brackets and fastened by bolts, rubber bushes and nuts. The cab mounting brackets 14 form a medium to transfer the drive line vibrations from chassis to the cab. Our invention cross member 15 dampens those drive line vibrations in the chassis 11 itself and improves ride pleasure to the passenger inside the cab. The detailed sketch of invention assembly cross member 15 is shown in Fig 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5.<br><br>
Fig.-2 shows the isometric view of a centre bearing cross member assembly (15). An upper longitudinal member according to an embodiment of this invention is a centre bearing cross member (17) and a lower longitudinal plate according to an embodiment of this invention is boxing plate (18).<br>
The centre bearing cross member assembly (15) consists of centre bearing cross member 17 and a boxing plate 18. The two parts are welded together by spot welding process. Spot welding is done on the bottom flange 22 (refer Fig. 4) of centre bearing cross member &amp; boxing plate- Fig. 3 shows the exploded isometric view of the centre bearing cross member 17 and the boxing plate 18. This view is provided for better clarity.<br>
