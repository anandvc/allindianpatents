				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Photofilters and UV-absorbers have been employed for a number of years<br>
to protect coloring dyes from fading from exposure to light. UV-sunscreens<br>
have also been employed to protect skin from damage from exposure to<br>
sunlight. Representative references related to UV-sunscreens are:<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,922,310 (Chaudhuri et al.) discloses a composition which<br>
includes a cationic antioxidant phenol in an amount of about 0.01-1% wt/wt.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,427,773 (Chaudhuri et al.); U.S. Patent No. 5,427,774<br>
(Chaudhuri et al.); and U.S. Patent No. 5,451,394 (Chaudhuri et al.)<br>
discloses non-hydrolysable, non irritating, hair, skin and textile substantive<br>
quaternary salts of p-dialkylaminobenzamides.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,633,403 (Gallagher et al.) discloses substantive UV-<br>
absorbing cinnamido amine cationic quaternary salts.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,830,441 (Wang et al.) discloses a photostable UV<br>
absorbent with maximum absorption above 340 nm.<br>
Hair is largely comprised of polypeptide chains that are held together by<br>
disulfide bonds which link adjacent polypeptide chains. The disulfide bonds<br>
are largely responsible for the mechanical strength and extensibility of hair.<br>
Exposure to sun tends to cause these disulfide bonds to break making the<br>
hair stiff and brittle in dry weather and frizzy in humid weather. Additionally,<br>
the hair also loses its color and luster in such conditions.<br>
The essential first event in hair photo damage, as in all processes, is light<br>
absorption by the Fiber. Only wavelengths above 290 nm will be<br>
consequential in natural photo damage since shorter wavelength UV light<br>
the stratosphere will effectively filter out. The most significant<br>
chromophores in proteins that absorb in the UV-B region are the amino<br><br>
acids, tyrosine (λmax 275 nm), tryptophan (λmax 280 nm), and the disulfide<br>
bonds (weak absorption at 290 nm). The longer wavelength UV-A and the<br>
visible light are not likely to cause damage directly since proteins do not<br>
absorb them. However, UV-A light is well known for generating free<br>
radicals; consequently damage to cholesterol and fatty acids occur.<br>
The photodegradation of hair results in a variety of physical and chemical<br>
changes. Among the physical changes are elimination of cuticle cells,<br>
roughening of the hair surface, loss of mechanical and elastic strength, and<br>
increased porosity. Chemically, we find photooxidation of cysteine,<br>
cholesterol, and fatty acids; the decomposition of tryptophan; breakage of<br>
disulfide bonds; and bleaching of melanin and artificial hair colors can<br>
occur.<br>
Human hair damage caused by sunlight in the UV spectrum is more severe<br>
than that resulting from all other factors such as weather, wind, atmospheric<br>
pollution, salt water, chlorinated water, perming, coloring, bleaching and<br>
improperly applied or repetitive treatments. Sunscreens used for skin are<br>
not suitable for hair because they are either not substantive or leave the<br>
hair dull and tacky. For hair protection, several approaches have been<br>
described, such as the deposition of photofilters on the hair surface, and<br>
the use of antioxidants or free radical scavengers.<br>
Recently, sunscreens also have been added to hair care products to guard<br>
against the deleterious effects of solar irradiation on the hair. Two<br>
sunscreens have been developed especially for hair, Escalol® HP 610 (US<br>
5,451,394) and Incroquat® UV-283 (US 5,633,403). Unfortunately, they<br>
both suffer from inadequate photostability, meaning that they degrade in<br>
the presence of light, and they lack desired hair substantivity, meaning that<br>
they can not be effectively applied and retained on hair.<br><br>
The ideal sunscreen formulation for hair should be nontoxic and non-<br>
irritating to the skin tissue and be capable of convenient application in a<br>
uniform and continuous film. The product should be chemically and<br>
physically stable so as to provide an acceptable shelf life upon storage. It<br>
is particularly desirable that the preparation should retain its protective<br>
effect over a prolonged period after application. The product must be<br>
substantive to hair or skin so that it does not get washed-off quickly. Thus,<br>
the active agent when present on the hair or skin must be resistant to<br>
chemical and/or photodegradation and be substantive.<br>
Techniques for stabilizing UV absorbent compositions are known.<br>
Representative disclosures in this area include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,567,418,<br>
5,538,716, 5.951,968 and 5,670,140.<br>
Antioxidants are believed to function by providing protection from free-<br>
radical damage. To be an effective free radical quencher, it is believed the<br>
antioxidant must be present in an adequate concentration at the site of free<br>
radical generation. Since antioxidants are used in low concentrations and<br>
typically lack functionality to become substantive to hair or skin, they may<br>
not be available at the site of generation, thereby reducing the desired<br>
protection. Many existing antioxidants can also act as pro-oxidants instead<br>
of antioxidants in presence of iron and copper (see a review on Transition<br>
Metal-Induced Oxidation by Chaudhuri and Pucceti, Cosm &amp; Toil, Vol 117,<br>
No. 9, p.43-56", 2002). Based on these beliefs, it is desirable to provide the<br>
antioxidant (having no pro-oxidation activity induced my transition metals)<br>
and photostable sunscreen functionality in a single molcule which is<br>
substantive to hair, skin or other substrates to enhance the effectiveness of<br>
the antioxidant properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is provided by the present invention compounds with sunscreen<br>
activity, i.e. they are chromophoric within the ultra violet radiation range of<br>
from 290-400 nm and they also exhibitantioxidant properties. The<br>
sunscreen Tormulations of this invention preferably offer protection from UV<br><br>
radiation with wavelengths of about 290 nm to 400 nm and preferably from<br>
wavelengths in the range of about 290-370 nm.<br>

In Formula I, each R is independently linear or branched C1 to C8 alkyl, or<br>
linear or branched C1 to C8 alkoxy; or one R is H and the other R is linear or<br>
branched C1 to C8 alkyl, or linear or branched C1 to C8 alkoxy.<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of COCH3, CO2R5, CONH2,<br>
CONH(R6)2, CN, COX(CH2)n-N-(R2)(R3), and the quatemized salt form<br>
of the formula COX(CH2)n-N-(R2)(R4)(R3)<br>

Preferred compounds of Formula I for hair and other substrate protection<br>
are illustrated by Formula II<br><br><br>
In Formula II, Ri is as defined for Formula I but is preferably COCH3 or<br>
CONH(CH2)3N+(CH3)2(CH2CH3) CH3CH2OSO'3; and X is O or NH.<br>

sulfonate. R2, R3 and R4 of formulae I and II are preferably independently<br>
linear or branched C1 to C8. R5 and R6 are preferably C1 to C8 alkyl.<br>
The invention is also directed to a hair care formulation containing the<br>
compound of the invention. The compound is typically used as a protective<br>
and conditioning ingredient in the hair care formulation against UV-A rays,<br>
UV-B rays, or both against UV-A and UV-B rays. The formulation can<br>
contain a single compound of formula I or a mixture of compounds of<br>
formula I.<br>
Preferably, the hair care formulation contains a compound or a mixture of<br>
compounds of the invention which are substantive and capable of<br>
protecting hair, skin or fibers against illumination in the range of about 310<br>
to 360 nm.<br>
It is also preferable that the compound or a mixture of compounds of the<br>
invention be capable of stabilizing the hair care formulation against<br>
photodegradation, and be further capable of providing an antioxidant<br>
property to the formulation.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to a mixture containing at least<br>
one compound of the invention and at least one other sunscreen agent.<br>
Advantageously, the other sunscreen agent is a sunscreen agent not of<br>
Formula I, and the compound of the invention is capable of stabilizing the<br>
additional sunscreen agent against photodegradation, or is capable of<br>
providing an antioxidant property to the mixture.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention is also directed to a method of<br>
protecting a substrate from UV radiation by applying a compound or mixture<br>
of compounds of this invention to the substrate.<br>
Advantageously, the substrate protected from UV radiation is hair.<br>
Alternatively, the substrate protected from UV radiation is a polymer, textile<br>
fabric, leather or paint. Alternatively, the compound can be used with a<br><br>
hairpiece made of natural or synthetic hair to protect the hairpiece from<br>
U.V. degradation.<br>
When the substrate is hair, an amount of the compound sufficient to<br>
improve the photostability of the hair care formulation is preferably added,<br>
and advantageously, in an amount sufficient to improve the antioxidant<br>
activity.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be used for improving the<br>
photostability of a U.V. absorbing composition by adding an effective<br>
amount of the compound. Likewise, the antioxidant activity of a<br>
composition can be improved by adding an effective amount of a<br>
compound of this invention with antioxidant activity. The composition can<br>
have one or more compounds of the invention and additional sunscreen<br>
agents which are not of the invention.<br>
The sunscreen formulations may contain dispersing agents, emulsifiers or<br>

100 nm. Titanium oxide may have anatase, rutile or amorphous structure.<br>
The zinc oxide in the sunscreen compositions preferably has a mean<br>
primary particle size of between 5 nm and 150 nm, preferably between 10<br>
nm and 100 nm. Examples of modified titanium dioxide compositions<br>
include (but not limited to only one supplier):<br>
Eusolex® T-45D (surface treated with alumina and simethicone, 45%<br>
dispersion in isononoyl isononoate);<br>
Eusolex®T-Aqua, (surface treated with aluminum hydroxide, 25%<br>
dispersion in water);<br>
Eusolex® TS (surface treated with aluminum stearate)<br>
and<br>
Eusolex® T-2000 and Eusolex® T-ECO (surface treated with alumina and<br>
simethicone), all available from MERCK KGaA.<br><br>
The sunscreen formulation may also contain one or more additional<br>
monomeric organic chromophoric compounds. These can either be UV-A,<br>
UV-B or broad band filters. Examples of suitable UV-A sunscreens include<br>
benzophenone derivatives, menthyl anthranilate, butyl methoxydibenzoyl<br>
methane and benzylidene-dioxoimidazoline derivatives. Examples of<br>
suitable UV-B sunscreens include cinnamate derivatives, salicylate<br>
derivatives, para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives, camphor derivatives,<br>
phenylbenzimidazole derivatives and diphenytacrylate derivatives.<br>
Examples of suitable broad-band sunscreen include benzotriazole<br>
derivatives and triazine derivatives such as anisotriazone. Others include<br>
ethylhexyttriazone and diethylhexylbutamidotriazone.<br>
Particularly useful organic sunscreen agents that can be introduced are<br>
Avobenzone, 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, 4,4'-t-<br>
butylmethoxydibenzoyl methane, 2 hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone,<br>
octyldimethyl p-aminobenzoic acid, 2,2-dihydroxy-4-<br>
methoxybenzophenone, ethyl-4-[bis(hydroxypropyl)]aminobenzoate, 2-<br>
ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate, 2-ethylhexylsalicylate, glycerol p-<br>
aminobenzoate, 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexylsalicylate, methylanthranilate, p-<br>
dimethylaminobenzoic acid, 2-ethylhexyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, 2-<br>
phenylbenzimidazole-5-5-sulfonic acid, 2-(p-dimethylamino phenyl-5-<br>
sulfoniobenzoxazoic acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of useful commercially available organic sunscreen agents that<br>
can be introduced include 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulphonic acid, 2-(4-<br>
methylbenzylidene)-camphor, 4-isopropyldibenzoyl methane all of the<br>
Eusolex™ series sold by EM Industries and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,<br>
Germany.<br>
Although not preferred, the sunscreen formulation may contain an<br>
additional antioxidant. Examples of suitable antioxidants which provide<br>
stability include p-hydroxybenzoic acid and its derivatives (ethylisobutyl,<br>
glyceryl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid); coumarin derivatives; flavones;<br>
hydroxy or methoxy substituted benzophenones; uric or tannic acid and its<br>
derivatives.<br><br>
In addition to providing sunscreen activity at levels which provide U.V.<br>
absorption, the compounds of Formula I can be introduced into a hair care<br>
formulation at levels which provide antioxidant activity. It has been found<br>
that to provide antioxidant functionality, the phenyl group of the compounds<br>
of formula I should have a substituent pattern of "3, 5-alkoxy, 4-hydroxy."<br>
Compounds of formula I and II also have a moiety which provides UV<br>
absorbing functionality, (chromophoric in the UV range).<br>
Additionally, the following compounds can be obtained:<br>
Formula III<br><br><br>
wherein R = linear or branched C1-C8 alkyl or linear or branched C1-C8<br>
alkoxy or one R is H and the other R is linear or branched C1 to C8 alkyl, or<br>
linear or branched C1 to C8 alkoxy, with a compound that provides a<br>
terminal tertiary amine. An example of a compound that provides a<br>
terminal tertiary amine is a compound of the formula: R1-CH2-C(O)X (CH2)n-<br>
N(R2)(R3) wherein R1- R3 and X are as defined above for formula I. The<br>
tertiary amine is then quarternized with a salt of the formula (R4)Y, wherein<br>
R4 is as defined above for formula I. An example of a suitable salt is<br>
diethylsulfate (CH3CH2)2SO4.<br>
The corresponding benzaldehyde can be obtained commercially or<br>
prepared from 3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde through selective<br>
monodemethylation at the 4-position. This technique leads to<br>
syringaldehyde. Alternately, syringaldehyde or other substituted aldehydes<br>
can be prepared from 3-bromo-4-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde (5-<br>
Bromo vanillin) by replacing the bromo atom with methoxy (or alkoxy) using<br>
the appropriate alcohol.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, it is believed that a<br>
representative Reaction I resulting in a compound of formula I proceeds in<br>
a manner such as this:<br><br><br>
Wherein "R7" is C1-C20 linear or branched alkyl, such as ethyl, iso-amyl and<br>
ethylhexyl, and R1 is as defined above for formula I.<br>
Similarly, a compound of Formula I has been synthesized from the following<br>
representative Reaction II, wherein the condensation step is followed by a<br>
quaternization step.<br>
The tertiary amine can be quaternized with diethylsulfate, p-toluene<br>
sulfonate or other salts such as C12H25 mesylate,<br><br>
wherein R is as defined above for formula I such as methoxy and t-butyl<br>
and R is as defined above for Representative Reaction I. An example of a<br>
quaternization reaction which provides a compound of formula IV is<br>
illustrated below.<br>
The compounds described above and hair care compositions comprising at<br>
least one of these compounds are useful to reduce artificial hair color<br>
fading and to protect artificial colored hair from fading. This protection is for<br><br>
example advantagous during hair wash. Therefore the compound is in one<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention used as an additive for shampoo-<br>
based formulations. Furthermore the compounds and hair care<br>
compositions comprising at least one the compounds are useful to reduce<br>
cleavage of disulfide bonds in hair and to to protect hair protein disulfide<br>
bonds from cleavage.<br>
The entire disclosure of all applications, patents and publications, cited<br>
above are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The examples below provide guidelines on how to make representative<br>
compounds of the invention.<br><br><br>
This process is taken in two steps.<br>
1)	Selective demethylation<br>
Momodemethylation of 3,4,5, trimethoxy benzaldehyde is performed using<br>
sulphuric acid at 40 degrees for 8 hours. Syringaldehyde is yielded.<br>
2)	Condensation<br>
N,N-Dimethylaminopropyl-alpha-cyanoacetamide is yielded at 80-85% by<br>
amidation of ethyl cyanoacetate using dimethyl aminopropylene in neat<br>
condition at 90-95'C.<br>
3,5-Dimethyl-4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (Syringaldehyde) is condensed with<br>
N.N-Dimethylaminopropyl-alpha-acylacetamide in the presence of<br>
piperdine-acetic acid and benzene as media at reflux temperature under<br>
continuous azeotropic water removal to yield the title compound. The<br>
reaction takes about 2 hours for completion. The yield obtained is about<br>
90%.<br>
The compound is a hair care sunscreen with antioxidant properties and can<br>
be quatemized with diethylsulfate to provide a substantive hair care<br>
sunscreen with antioxidant properties.<br>
Example 2<br><br><br>
The process involves 3 steps:<br>
1)	Selective demethylation<br>
Monodemethylation of 3, 4,5, trimethoxy benzaldehyde is performed using<br>
sulphuric acid at 40 degrees C for 8 hours. Syringaldehyde is yielded.<br>
2)	Condensation<br>

by amidation of ethyl cyanoacetate using dimethyl aminopropylene in neat<br>
condition at 90-95°C.<br>
3,5-diimethoxy-4-hydroxy benzaldehyde is condensed with N.N-<br>
Dimethylaminopropyl-alpha-cyanoacetamide in the presence of piperdine-<br>
acetic acid and benzene as media at reflux temperature under continuous<br>
azeotropic water removal. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-alpha-cyano-3,5-<br>
dimethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamide is yielded. The reaction takes two hours<br>
for completion. The yield is 90%.<br>
3)	Quaternisation<br>
The N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-alpha-cyano-3,5-dimethoxy cinnamide is<br>
quaternised with dodecyl mesylate (C12H25OSO2CH3) at 100-105 degrees C<br>
in propylene glycol as a reaction medium. The final compound is produced<br>
with a 92% yield.<br><br>

and stirred with continuous water removal for 13.5 hours. The reaction was<br>
checked by TLC (mobile phase= benzene:hexane:acetone (80:20:10)) with<br>
product detected under UV. Once product is detected, the reaction mass is<br>
cooled to 60-65 deg. C. and benzene removed under mild vacuum at 60-80<br>
deg. C. The mass is degassed for 1/2 hour under vacuum at 75-80deg.C.<br>
and nitrogen bleeding is started. The thick residue is dissolved in dimethyl<br>
formamide (200.0ml) with stirring and cooled to 10-15 deg C.<br>
The dissolved reaction mass is charged with diethyl sulphate (150.0 gm) at<br>
10-15 deg C and is heated to 85-90 deg. C. with stirring for six hours.<br>
Benzene (400.0ml) is charged into this mixture and stirred for 10 minutes at<br>
85-90 deg. C, after which, separate layers were allowed to form. The<br>
product layer (lower layer) was separated and washed with benzene (250<br>
ml) at 85-90 deg. C, charged with methanol (350 ml) and charcoal (10.0<br>
gm) at 50-55 deg. C. with stirring for one hour and then filtered through a<br>
Hydro-flow bed. The filtered layer was washed with methanol (50 ml) and<br>
distilled at 50-55 deg. C. with vacuum to remove methanol.<br>
The mass was degassed for one hour at 90-95 deg. C. under vacuum. The<br>
yield obtained is about 85%. The product is highly soluble in water and has<br>
λmax 323 nm (EtOHrwater- 70%:30%) with εmax = 10,500 cm-1 mol-1. A 50%<br>
solution in water was prepared for ease of handling.<br>
Example 4<br>
Bis-N-[3(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl]-3-methoxy-4-hydroxy benzylidene<br>
malonamide bis ethylsulfate<br>
This material was prepared by following the procedure described in<br>
Example 3, except syringaldehyde was replaced with vanillin as a starting<br>
material. The product has a λmax at 334 nm (e max 18050 cm"1 mol-1). A<br>
50% solution in water was prepared for ease of handling.<br><br>
DPPH Test Method<br>
A DPPH concentrate (2.5X) of 25mg of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picyrl-Hydrazyl<br>
ACS# 1898-66-4 (Sigma #D-9132, lot 99H3601) dissolved in 250mL<br>
ethanol (USP), is prepared fresh on the measurement date. A DPPH<br>
working solution is then prepared by diluting 100mL of this concentrate to a<br>
final volume of 250mL (100 M/mL). A blank 13x100mm borosilicate glass<br>
screw top tube of ethanol (USP) is used to zero the spectrometer (Milton<br>
Roy, Spectronic 20+) at 517 nm and a control tube of DPPH working<br>
solution is measured under identical conditions, and taken as 0% activity.<br>
Aliquots of the 0.25% &amp; 0.5% (RT &amp; 45EC) test solution are added to tubes<br>
followed by the rapid addition of 4mL DPPH working solution then rapidly<br>
capped and mixed. After 20 minutes, the absorbance of each sample is<br>
read at 517 nm.<br>
The percent reducing activity (%RA) is calculated using the following<br>
equation:<br>
% Reduction Activity = 100 A (0)-A(20)<br>
A(0)<br>
Where A(0) is the absorbance value of the DPPH working solution at<br>
517nm zeroed against an ethanol blank and A(20) is the absorbance at<br>
517nm, 20 minutes after combining the antioxidant with the DPPH working<br>
solution.<br>
The concentration of antioxidant (mg/ml) in the final assay mixture is<br>
calculated based on the dilution of respective aliquots of each compound in<br>
the final assay volume and %RA tabulated and plotted as percent activity at<br>
each concentration in the dilution series.<br>
Compounds with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy substitution are found to exhibit<br>
much higher reducing activity (antioxidant activity) than compounds with<br>
3,4,5-trimethoxy substitution. In order to boost antioxidant activity of the<br>
compounds of the present invention, other antioxidants can be combined.<br>
Some examples are those antioxidants mentioned above are Tocopherols,<br><br>
tocopherylacetate, Ascorbic acid, Emblica antioxidants, Proanthocyanidins<br>
(from pine bark, grape seed extract, and the like) green tea polyphenols,<br>
rosemary antioxidants, gallic acid, ellagic acid, butylhydroxy toluene (BHT),<br>
butylhydroxy anisole (BHA) and the like.<br>
Antioxidant activity of some of the product in the present invention is<br>
included in Table A which follows:<br><br>
Photostability<br>
The photostability of compounds of the present invention as well as existing<br>
commercial cationic sunscreens is tested according to the procedure<br>
described below:<br>
Photostability: Comparative Photostability of Example 3, Incroquat® 283<br>
and Escalol® HP610<br>
Three products [Example 3 (1%), Incroquat 283 (1%) and HP610 (0.1%)]<br>
were tested for their photostability by dissolving separately in water or<br>
ethanol-water solution containing 0.1% Poly(vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate)<br>
copolymer (PVP-VA S630 from ISP). Air drying on a glass plate for one<br>
hour gave a thin film, which were irradiated under UV A (2 MED/h) and UV<br>
B (1 MED/h) light separately over an 8h period in a Q-UV Accelerated<br>
Weathering Tester. Photodegradation was calculated from the decrease in<br>
the maximum absorption of the respective products. The results are<br>
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.<br><br>
The results in Figures 1 and 2 clearly show that the product obtained from<br>
Example 3 has much higher photostability over the two commercially<br>
available cationic sunscreens, namely, Escalol® HP 610 and Incroquat®<br>
UV 283.<br>
Stabilizing Activity<br>
The stabilizing activity of the compound obtained from Example 3 toward<br>
Avobenzone is tested and compared with a conventional product according<br>
to the procedures below.<br>
Two formulated products [one containing Avobenzone (2%w/w) and the<br>
other one with Avobenzone+Example 3 product (2+2% w/w)] were tested<br>
for their photostability by applying samples (1-2 ng/cm2) in between two<br>
glass plates and irradiating the samples under UV A (2 MED/h) and UV B<br>
(1 MED/h) light separately over a 6hour period in a Q-UV Accelerated<br>
Weathering Tester. Photodegradation was calculated from the decrease in<br>
the maximum absorption of the respective products. The results show a<br>
54% improvement in photostabilization of Avobenzone using Example 3<br>
product.<br>
Hair Substantivity: Comparative hair substantivity of Example 3, Incroquat®<br>
283 and Escalol® HP610<br>
Tests in aqueous solution: Tests are performed by using aqueous solutions<br>
of Example 3 and Incroquat at 1% concentration. 100 ml aqueous solution<br>
(containing 100 mg product) are added, under constant stirring, to 1g of a<br>
slightly bleached hair swatch (cut in fine pieces less than 1/3 " long). The<br>
product uptake is determined by measuring the maximal absorption of<br>
product remaining in the solute over time. The results for Example 3 and<br>
Incroquat at 1% concentration are shown in Figure 3. Escalol® HP610<br>
could not be tested in aqueous solution due to its very poor solubility.<br><br>
Test in aqueous ethanolic solution: Example 3 and Incroquat® UV 283<br>
have been prepared in aqueous-ethanolic solution (30:70%) at 1%<br>
concentration while a maximal concentration of Escalol® HP610 was<br>
reached at 0.25%. 100 ml of each solution is added, under constant stirring,<br>
to 1 g of a slightly bleached hair swatch under identical conditions as the<br>
previous test. The values for relative uptake of these solutions are reported<br>
in Figure 4.<br>
For better comparison, the relative uptake of Escalol® HP610 is corrected<br>
from 0.25% solution to a 1 % solution to account for the same initial weight<br>
amount as compared to the other two cationic sunscreens (100 mg of initial<br>
product present).<br>
The results illustrated in Figure 4 clearly show that the product obtained<br>
from Example 3 has much higher hair substantivity from both aqueous and<br>
aqueous-ethanolic solutions over two commercially available cationic<br>
sunscreens, namely, Escalol® HP 610 and Incroquat® UV 283.<br>
Chelating property<br>
Iron-catalyzed formation of a hydroxyl radical from a superoxide anion<br>
radical and hydrogen peroxide requires the availability of at least one iron<br>
coordination site that is either empty or occupied by a readily dissociable<br>
ligand, such as water. This coordination with water may be completely<br>
displaced by stronger ligands like azide (N3- ) anion. We have applied this<br>
principle and determined free coordination site(s) (if any) in the Fe3+ (or<br>
Cu2+)-antioxidant complex using a UV spectrophotometry method (Graf et<br>
a/, 1984; Martell et a/, 1957). The results are recorded in Tablesl and 2.<br><br><br>
Example 3 showed the absence of any water coordination (that is, the<br>
complex is fully and firmly saturated and there is no room for any pro-<br>
oxidant activity via the formation of oxo-ferryl or oxo-cupryl radical). All<br>
other antioxidants/chelators showed disparate coordination site(s) thereby<br>
allowed for the formation of oxo-ferryl or oxo-cupryl radicals and<br>
manifesting a pro-oxidant effect, particularly at low concentrations. Example<br>
3 a s t he m ost e ffective c helator o f I oose i ran and copper, would prevent<br>
oxidative stress-induced damage to hair and skin caused by radicals and<br>
loose transition metal ions. Two commercial cationic sunscreens, namely,<br>
Escalol® HP 610 and Incroquat® UV 283 do not have iron-or copper-<br><br><br><br>
Phase B. Mix until mixture is homogeneous and cool to about 50 C. Add<br>
Phase C to the above mixture and stir well.<br>
Adjust pH using citric acid to 5-6.<br>
Example 7: Deep conditioner Formulation with vegetable protein<br><br>
Procedure<br>
Heat Phase A to 70 - 75 C with agitation. In a separate vessel, heat Phase<br>
B to 70 - 75 C until melted. Add B to A with agitation. Cool to 50 C add<br>
Phase C and D with stirring. Allow to cool to room temperature. Then add<br>
Phase E, if needed with stirring.<br><br><br><br><br>
Procedure<br>
Heat Phase A to approximately to 75 C. Stir Phase B; heat to 75 C. Add B<br>
to A with stirring. Homogenize and cool down the temperature to about 50<br>
C and add Phase C.<br>
Example 10<br>
Protection of Artificial Hair Color Fading (Auburn Color)<br>
The UV photoprotection of hair is tested for compound of Example 3 in<br>
comparison to a control formulation. The lightness and color changes over<br>
time of UV-B irradiation of auburn-dyed hair were measured by using an X-<br>
Rite L.a.b. instrument. L is lightness in color, a is color in red-green axis &amp; b<br>
is color in blue-yellow axis. Measured quantities are:<br>
AE = [(Al)2+(Aa)2+(Ab)2]1'2<br>
AC = [(Aa)2+(Ab)2]1'2<br>
Two samples of hair were irradiated: one treated with base formulation<br>
without active (Control) and the another one with active containing 2%<br>
compound from Example 3.<br>
Method of Product Application on to Hair<br>
Apply, directly by hand, a pre-weighted amount of concentrated product on<br>
a pre-weighted hair-strand. The amount of active ingredient per gram of<br>
hair has been chosen as 50 mg. Hair strands were given 48 h to dry before<br>
combing and exposure to UV B (2 MED/ hr).<br>
Results are given in Figures 5 and 6<br>
Effect after 36 hr UV-B exposure<br>
62% reduction in AE vs control<br>
54% reduction in AC vs control<br>
Effect after 60 hr UV-B exposure<br>
56% reduction in AE vs control<br>
54% reduction in AC vs control<br>
Example 11<br><br>
Similar studies were done as described in Example 10 using bleached and<br>
colored hairs (other than auburn) with about 50% reduction in color fading.<br>
Example 12<br>
Protection of DisulfideBond in Hair Protein Keratin<br>
Protocol for Merbromin test for determining disulfide bond cleavage of hair<br>
Three hair strands were tested by the procedure:<br>
a- A non treated and non irradiated control strand,<br>
b- a non treated but irradiated strand and<br>
c- a treated and irradiated strand.<br>
50 mg of active per gm applied on to auburn-dyed hair (hand application of<br>
a 2% formulation). Hair strands were exposed to UV B irradiation for 60 h.<br>
The Merbromin staining was done following the steps described below.<br>
1.	Preparation of an aqueous staining solution of 1% Merbromin<br>
(Mercurochrome) and 0.5% Triton<br>
2.	Two hair strands, treated with a control formulation (without active)<br>
and the active formulation, were exposed to UV B irradiation for 60 h at the<br>
rate of 2 MED / h.<br>
3.	After photo-exposure, hair strands were immersed in the staining<br>
solution for 1 h at room temperature. Then, they were thoroughly rinsed,<br>
shampooed three times with 10% ALS solution, and soaked for 96 h in 1%<br>
ALS solution with a daily solution change. The non-irradiated hair was<br>
submitted to a double shampooing with 1% ALS solution. After the final<br>
rinse, hair strands were dried at room temperature and measured by use of<br>
a MA68 handheld colorimeter from X-Rite.<br>
4.	The L.a.b. values were measured and expressed in terms of total<br>
color difference AE = (AL2+Aa2+Ab2)1/2 and a chromaticity difference AC =<br>
(Aa2+Ab2)1/2 between unexposed and exposed hair strands (Figure 7).<br>
Results<br>
The dying duration in mercurochrome was 1 h, followed by shampooed<br>
washing and 96 h soaking in 1 % aqueous Laureth sulfate solution.<br><br>
The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by<br>
substituting the generically or specifically described reactants and/or<br>
operating conditions of this invention for those used in the examples.<br>
From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain<br>
the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications<br>
of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.<br>
Example 13<br>
Reduction in Hair Color Fading During Repeated Shampooing<br>
Auburn -dyed hair was shampooed 10 times with a 2% aqueous solutions<br>
of SLS without and with 1% of compound according to example 3. Color<br>
changes are quantified by L.a.b. measurements at different times of<br>
shampooing (0, 5 and 10 shampoos).<br>
Method: A 9 g swatch of hair is dipped and stirred for 2 minutes by hand in<br>
a 200 ml test solution containing 2% SLS as to remain covered by foam.<br>
They were then thoroughly rinsed under slightly warm water and dried at<br>
room temperature for 2 h, followed by drying at 80F for an additional hour.<br>
At the time of measurement, hair swatches were combed to align all hair<br>
fibers parallel and L.a.b. values measured with a X-Rite colorimeter.<br>
Results: Simple shampooing of hair swatches increases the L and b values<br>
(Fig. 8), i.e. the hair becomes lighter and shifts toward yellow. If the<br>
shampoo includes 1% compound according to example 3, no significant<br>
change in L or b values are observed. However, a decrease in "a" value is<br>
observed which is due to the compound according to example 3<br>
accumulation over repeated shampooing. This is confirmed by separate<br><br>
L.a.b. measurements of auburn hair swatches with different amounts of<br>
compound according to example 3 applied as a conditioner (figure 9). The<br>
a value clearly decreases proportionally with the concentration. This data<br>
indicates that the product is substantive and can be delivered from<br>
shampoo-based formulations<br><br>
