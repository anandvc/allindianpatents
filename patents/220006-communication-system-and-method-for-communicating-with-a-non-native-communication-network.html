SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR UTILIZING AN APPLICATION FROM A NATIVE PORTABLE DEVICE WITHIN A NON-NATIVE<br>
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK<br>
BACKGROUND AND RELATED ART<br>
[001]	This invention relates to systems and methods for modifying communications within a<br>
communications network, and, more particularly, to systems and methods for utilizing an application from a portable device within a "non-native" communications network, or in other words, a communications network with which the portable device was not originally intended to communicate.<br>
[002]	The complexity of communications systems are ever-increasing due to the increasing<br>
number of different types of communications devices and different types of communications networks. For example, portable or wireless devices, wireline and wireless phones, and desktop and portable computers are increasingly used in conjunction on one or more communications networks, each having different standards and protocols, to transfer all different types of information. Such information includes, for example, voice data, audio data and video data. Because of the differences in communications standards and protocols between the various communications networks, a given communication device is typically designed for operation with a specific communications network. For example, a typical wireless phone designed for native operation on a Global System for Mobile ("GSM") communications network will not be able to communicate on a non-native Code-Division Multiple Access ("CDMA") communications network. In another example, a typical portable device designed for operation on a native BLUETOOTH communications network is not operable on a non-native GSM network. Thus, there is a need to improve the interoperability of the plethora of communications devices with the plethora of communications networks to enable applications to be utilized on both native and non-native communication networks.<br>
[003]	Additionally, in some cases, a party receiving or transmitting the information desires the<br>
communication to be modified prior to its receipt or transmission. One example of a modified<br>
*  "	communication is a communication that is encrypted or decrypted by a security application. An<br>
encrypted communication is referred to as a secure communication, as only a party having the<br>
proper decryption algorithm or key may understand it.   For example, a party transmitting<br><br>
sensitive or confidential information may desire to transmit it as a secure communication, such as by scrambling the communication using an encryption algorithm or key. Upon receiving the secure communication and applying the corresponding decryption algorithm or key, one may obtain the original or clear communication. Thus, private and secure communications may be achieved over a variety of public communications networks.<br>
[004]	Current solutions for establishing secure communications over public communications<br>
networks, such as the public switched telephone network or wireless networks, have a number of drawbacks. Most secure communications products are not portable. Typically, these products comprise desktop units that require a physical interconnection between a wireline phone handset and its base unit, or between the base unit and a wall interface to the public switched telephone network. Depending on whether voice or data communications are to be secured, some products may require the connection to be physically changed. For example, some products require a connection to a computer for secure data communications. This requirement of continuously having to change the connection leads to consumer dissatisfaction because of the continuous need to connect and disconnect the various devices based on the use. Further, these products require security applications to be locally resident within the product. This local residence of the security application exposes the secure aspects of the product to tampering. Further, an item having encryption technology may be considered a Controlled Cryptographic Item"("CCT). A CCI device is defined as secure telecommunications or information handling equipment, with an associated cryptographic component, that is governed by a special set of control requirements that may add additional cost to an item due to special handling, storage and export restrictions. Additionally, some of these secure communication products are not universally compatible with any type of wireline phone. Finally, most of these products are very expensive.<br>
[005]	Thus, improved systems and methods of interoperable communications between devices<br>
and networks are desired, along with more flexible systems and methods of modifying a communication relying on a variety of public communications networks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[006]	In one embodiment, a communications system comprises a first application module and a<br>
first interface module. The first application module is connectable with a first portable communications device operable within a native communications network having a native communications standard. The first application module is operable for transforming an outgoing<br><br>
native communication into an outgoing non-native communication, or operable for transforming an incoming non-native communication into an incoming native communication. The incoming native communication is compatible with the native communications network, and the outgoing non-native communication is compatible with a non-native communications standard associated with a non-native communications network. The first interface module is in communication with the first application module and connectable to a second communications device operable within the non-native communications network. The first interface module is operable for transmitting and receiving both native and non-native communications.<br>
[007]	In another embodiment of the invention, a communications accessory includes an<br>
interface system operable for communication with at least two of a non-native device, a portable device having an application module and a non-native communications network. The . communications accessory further includes a switch mechanism having at least a first mode and a second mode of operation. In the first mode the switch mechanism allows communications between the non-native device and the non-native communications network to be modified by the application module of the portable device. In the second mode the switch mechanism allows communications between the non-native device and the non-native communications network without modification by the application module of the portable device.<br>
[008]	In another embodiment, a secure communications accessory includes an interface system<br>
operable for communication with at least two of a non-native device, a portable device having a security application and a non-native communications network. The communications accessory further includes a switch mechanism having a first mode and a second mode of operation. In the first mode the switch mechanism routes communications between the non-native device and the non-native communications network through the security application of the portable device. In the second mode the switch mechanism connects the non-native device and the non-native communications network without routing communications through the security application of the portable device.<br>
[009]	In yet another embodiment, a communications accessory includes a number of interface<br>
systems and a switch system interconnecting the interface systems. The interface systems include a non-native interface system, a^ public switched telephone network interface system and a portable device interface system. The non-native device interface system is connectable with a non-native device. The public switched telephone network interface system is connectable with a public switched telephone network. The portable device interface system is connectable with a<br><br>
portable device having an application module. And, the switch system is operable for transmitting communications between at least two of the non-native device interface system, the public switched telephone network interface system and the portable device interface system. The switch system includes at least a first connection state and a second connection state. In the first connection state the switch system connects the non-native device interface system and the public switched telephone network interface system through the portable device interface system such that the transmitted communications are modified by the application module. In the second connection state the switch system connects the non-native device and the public switched telephone network and bypasses the portable device interface system.<br>
[0010]	In a further embodiment, a communications system includes a communications accessory<br>
and a portable device. The communications accessory has an interface system for transmitting communications, wherein the communications accessory is connectable with at least a non-native * • device and a non-native communications network. The portable device has an application module, wherein the portable device is connectable with the communications accessory. And, the interface system has at least a first mode and a second mode of operation. In the first mode the interface system allows communications between the non-native device and the non-native communications network to be modified by the application module of the portable device. In the second mode the interface system allows communications between the non-native device and the non-native communications network without modification by the application module of the portable device.<br>
[0011]	In another embodiment, a method of modifying a communication between a non-native<br>
device and a non-native communications network includes receiving a first communication from a first one of either the non-native device or the non-native communications network. The first communication is directed to a portable device having an application module. A second communication is received from the portable device, where the second communication includes a transformation of the first communication effected by the application module. And, the method further includes directing the second communication to a second one of either the non-native device or the non-native communications network, where the first one and the second one are not the same. Thus, the method allows for a communication between the non-native device and the non-native communications network that may be selectively modified by the application module of the portable device.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to Fig. 1, one embodiment of a communications system 11 includes a native<br>
portable communications device 18 having an application module 20 that modifies communications between the portable device and a non-native communications device 14 connected to a non-native communications network 16. Application module 20 transforms communications between a native standard to a non-native standard to allow interoperability between native portable communications device 18 and non-native communications device 14 within native communications network 13 and non-native communications network 16. Further, application module 20 may modify communications in other manners, such as to apply a security function to the communication.  As such, application module 20 may include any application<br><br>
implemented in hardware or software that modifies original analog or digital data before passing it on to a non-native communications system or device. Thus, native portable communications device 18 with application module 20 provides a mobile system that enables modified communications over various communications networks.<br>
[0020]	Native portable communications device 18 includes an operational module 38 enabling<br>
operation of the portable device within native communications network 13 having a native communications standard. Application module 20 is operable for transforming an outgoing native communication 15 into an outgoing non-native communication 17 that allows native portable device 18 to interact with non-native device 14 and non-native network 16. Further, application module 20 is operable for transforming an incoming non-native communication 19 into an incoming native communication 23 that allows further interoperability. The modified communications are thus compatible across networks, as incoming native communication 23 is compatible with native communications network 13 and outgoing non-native communication 17 is compatible with a non-native communications standard associated with non-native communications network 16.<br>
[0021]	Additionally, interface module 25 is in communication with application module 20 and<br>
connects to an interface module 27 of non-native communications device 14, as well as connecting to native communications network 13. For example, interface modules 25, 27 may include a mechanical interconnection, such as through a cable, or a physical interconnection, such as through infra-red ("IR") light waves or other non-contact mechanisms. Interface module 25 is operable for transmitting and receiving both native and non-native communications 17, 19, transferring them to or from application module 20.<br>
[0022]	Non-native communications device 14 includes an operational module 29 enabling<br>
operation of the non-native device within non-native communications network 16 having a non-native communications standard. Through interaction with native portable communications device 18, non-native device 14 achieves enhanced communications functionality, based on the capabilities of application module 20, to transmit and receive modified communications across non-native network 16 or to become interoperable with native network 13.<br>
[0023]	In one method .of operation 31, referring to Fig. 2, system 11 allows communications<br>
between an end user having a native portable communications device and a non-native communications network. In this embodiment, the end user generates an input, in the form of a native communication, into a native portable communications device (Block 33).   The native<br><br>
communication is sent to the application module which modifies the native communication and transforms it into an outgoing non-native communication (Block 35).<br>
[0024]	The outgoing non-native communication represents the native communication, but in a<br>
transport format compatible with a non-native communications network. For example, the native communication may include one or more native commands that may have corresponding non-native commands. The application module, which may include a plurality of native and non-native commands, may determine the corresponding non-native command and modify the form of the native communication to replace the native command with the corresponding non-native command. Such a determination by application module may be based on a know relationship between native and non-native commands, or may be based on a trial-and-error process. For example, in a trial-and-error process, the application module may select one of the plurality of non-native commands, transform the native communication to a first non-native communication using the first selected non-native command, and transmit the non-native communication. If the non-native communications device rejects the non-native communication, then the application module may select a second one of the plurality of non-native commands and create a second non-native communication. Communication attempts would continue with the non-native communications device until the proper form of non-native communication is found.<br>
[0025]	Continuing with method of operation 31, the outgoing non-native communication (Block<br>
35) is transmitted to the non-native communications device (Block 37). The non-native communications device receives the outgoing non-native communication and may check its compatibility with the non-native communications network (Block 39). If the communication is not compatible, then a signal rejecting the communication is sent back to native portable device (Block 41) and the modification process (Block 35) is repeated. If the non-native device finds the non-native communication to be compatible, then it forwards the communication to the non-native communications network (Block 43).<br>
[0026]	In another method of operation 45, referring to Fig. 3, system 11 allows communications<br>
between a non-native device associated with a non-native communications network and an end user having a native portable communications device. In this embodiment, the non-native device receives a non-native communication from the non-native network (Block 47). The non-native device transmits the non-native communication to the native portable device (Block 49). The native portable device receives the non-native communication, and the application module modifies the incoming non-native communication to transform it into an incoming native<br><br>
communication compatible with the native portable device and the native communications network, and transmits the modified communication within the native portable device to the end user (Block 51). The transformation of the communication by the application module occurs in the same manner as described above with regard to method of operation 31 (Fig. 2), but in the opposite direction, i.e. switching from non-native to native compatibility. The newly modified incoming native communication may be transmitted to the operational module or interface module of the native device, which checks the compatibility of the communication (Block 53). If the communication is not compatible, a signal rejecting the communication is sent to application module (Block 55) and the transformation process is repeated (Block 51). If the communication is compatible, then it is output to the end user (Block 57).<br>
[0027]	Thus, in both methods of operation 31, 45, the application module acts as a virtual<br>
modem that allows interoperability between a native portable communications device and a non-native communications device. Further, this interoperability allows the non-native device to utilize the functionality of the application module for communicating with the non-native communications network.<br>
[0028]	Referring to Fig. 3, in another embodiment, a communications system 21 includes an<br>
interface device or communications accessory 12 for transmitting communications between at least two of a non-native communications device 1*4, a non-native communications network 16 and native portable device 18 having application module 20. The communications accessory 12 includes a switch system 22 having at least a first mode and a second mode. In the first mode, switch system 22 connects non-native device 14 and non-native communications network 16 through portable device 18. This first mode connection allows a communication through communications accessory 12 between non-native device 14 and non-native communications network 16 to be modified by application module 20. In the second mode, switch system 22 bypasses portable device 18 in connecting non-native device 14 and non-native communications network 16. This second mode connection allows substantially direct communications between non-native device 14 and non-native communications network 16 through communications accessory 12, or at least the second mode allows communications without modification by application module 20. Thus, communications system 10 and communications accessory 12, via switch system 22, allow communications through the communications accessory to be selectively modified by application module 20 of portable device 18.<br><br>
[0029]	For example, in one embodiment, communications accessory 12 may be utilized as a<br>
secure wireline telephone product for encryption and decryption of wireline voice and data calls through non-native communications network 16, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network ("PSTN"). In this instance, application module 20 includes a security application having an encryption/decryption algorithm. Operation of communications accessory 12 with switch system 22 in the first mode and interfaced with portable device 18, for example, allows an incoming encrypted or secure communication from non-native communications network 16 to be modified by application module 20 to form a decrypted or clear communication transmittable to non-native device 14. Alternatively, an outgoing clear communication from non-native device 14 can be encrypted to foim a secure communication transmittable to non-native communications network 16. Operation of communications accessory 12 with switch system 22 in the second mode allows clear communications between non-native device 14 and non-native communications network 16. Thus, in this example, communications accessory 12 interfaces with portable device 18 to utilize a security application within application module 20 to transform a standard wireline telephone device into a secure voice/data wireline telephone device for communication with a public communications network.<br>
[0030]	Communications accessory 12 may include one or a combination of a "bump-in-the-cord"<br>
communications module, a docking station, a dual device charger, or any other similar type of device capable of interfacing between a non-native device, a non-native communications network and a portable device. Communications accessory 12 includes at least a non-native device interface 24, a non-native communications interface 26 and a portable device interface 28 that may be selectively connected through switch system 22. Non-native device interface 24, non-native communications network interface 26 and portable device interface 28, respectively, may include any type of connector for transmittably connecting non-native device 14, non-native communications network 16 and portable device 18, respectively, to communications accessory 12. For instance, suitable interfaces 24, 26, 28 may include a mechanical connector such as an RJ-11 port, a USB ports, an RS-232 port, a wireless transmit/receive device such as a radio frequency ("RF") or radio wave transponder, an infra-red ("IR") or other light wave transponder and an-electrical/magnetic transmitter/receiver, and a modem. Interfaces 24,26,28 may include a plurality of interfaces for connecting with a plurality of complementary devices/systems or portions of such devices/systems. For example, non-native device interface 24 may include a first interface for connection with a corded handset and a second interface for connection with a<br><br>
base unit. Additionally, non-native device interface 24 and portable device interface 28 may include a cradle or other structure for holding or supporting non-native device 14 and portable device 18, respectively.<br>
[0031]	As discussed above, communications accessory 12 includes switch system 22 for<br>
transmittably interconnecting interfaces 24, 26, 28. Switch system 22 may include any type of hardware or software operable for selectively routing a communication among interfaces 24, 26, 28. For instance, switch system 22 may include one or more multiplexers for interconnecting the various routing circuitry within communications accessory 12. These multiplexers may be controlled by command signals from portable device 18 for selectively changing their routing configuration. In one embodiment, for example, a default configuration would allow voice communications to travel unimpeded between non-native device interface 24 and non-native communications network interface 26. The multiplexers may be two-, three- and four-state or more to provide the required routing for all possible operational modes. Further, the secure or "red" portions of switch system 22 may be independent or isolated from the clear or "black" portions to further guarantee the integrity of the communication modified by application module 20.<br>
[0032]	Additionally, communications accessory 12 may include an interface operational module<br>
30 having one or a combination of hardware, software and firmware for use in controlling the<br>
interoperability of the various components of communications accessory 12, or for aiding<br>
interoperability with non-native device 14, non-native communications network 16 or portable<br>
device 18. It should be noted, however, that interface operational module 30 may be an optional<br>
component of communications accessory 12. Exemplary embodiments of interface operational<br>
module 30 may include one, or varying combinations, of a microcontroller, a central processing<br>
unit ("CPU"), random access memory ("RAM"), read-only memory ("ROM"), input/output<br>
("I/O") ports, operating system software, application software, interfacing software, and various<br>
circuitry. Further, for example, interface operational module 30 may provide state or status<br>
signals representative of various states or statuses of communications accessory 12. Examples of<br>
state/status signals include: an identification signal that may be transmitted to non-native device<br>
14 or portable device 18 to indicate the presence of communications accessory; one or more line	-  -<br>
status signals transmittable to non-native device 14 or portable device 18 to indicate a status of the other device, for example, a signal to portable device 18 that non-native device 14 is off the hook or already connected to a call, or a signal to non-native device 14 that portable device 18 or<br><br>
non-native communications network 16 is connected to communications device 12; and one or more monitoring signals indicative of a mode or state of all or portions of switching system 22, where such monitoring signals may be transmitted to one or more functional mechanisms 32 associated with communications accessory 12, as will be discussed below in more detail.<br>
[0033]	Interface operation module 30 may provide the functional and operational support for<br>
each operational mode of communications accessory 12 and associated non-native device 14 and portable device 18. Such operational modes include: clear voice pass through; secure voice; secure data; clear to secure transitions; battery charging operations; receiving over-the-air ("OTA") calls on portable device 18 without interfering with non-native device 14 activities; and transparent call delivery or forwarding from connected portable device 18 to non-native device 14. Further, interface operational module 30 may help support any type of communication protocol or application usable with communications accessory 12, such as: analog or digital data or voice; conversion protocols such as pulse code modulation ("PCM"); secure and clear voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") communications; group services/group communications applications, such as those using SIP, SDP, TCP/IP and UDP protocols; integrated services digital network ("ISDN") protocol; and other such protocols.<br>
[00341	As mentioned above, communications accessory 12 may include one or more functional<br>
