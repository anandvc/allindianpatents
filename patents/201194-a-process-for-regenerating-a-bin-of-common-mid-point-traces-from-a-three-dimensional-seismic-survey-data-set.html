				<td>The present invention relates to a process for generating a bin of common mid-point traces from a three-dimensional seismic survey data set. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of seismic signal processing, and specifically to the area of three dimensional seismic signal processing.<br>
In performing traditional two dimensional seismic data processing on multiple fold data, common mid-point ("CIvlP") gathers are made, in comparing the traces in the gather, the offset (distance between the source and receiver) of the traces varies. Further, in comparing the gather of one mid-point to the gather of another midpoint, the number of traces and the offset variation is substantially the same. Iviost differences occur due to the need to remove an obviously bad trace from the data set. However, in high fold data, such blanking is not appreciable.<br>
In performing three dimensional analysis, rather than common mid-point gathers, common mid-point bins are made of the data, which include traces having a common mid point, and various offsets from ray traces having traveled cross-line. Such bins might have consistent fold, but uniform offset distribution does not exist For example, as seen in Fig. 1, a typical acquisition geometry for ocean-bottom prospecting is seen, in which two receiver lines RL1 and RL2 are laid out parallel to each other. Sail Lines are shot orthogonal to the receiver lines at regular intervals {SL1).<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, nine common-midpoint bins (BIN 1 - BIN 9) from the survey geometry of Figs. 1 and 2 are shown, in which each line within the bin<br>
represents a trace, the vertical and horizontal axes are offset. Here, it is seen<br>
1A<br><br>
that the offset distribution is not uniform. This pattern is dependent upon the acquisition geometry! and this non-uniform pattern has not been found to be avoidable. Changing the acquisition geometry to accommodate offset distribution in the common mid-point bins is not practical.<br>
In some forms of analysis, the variation of trace attributes as a function of offset or angle of reflection is of interest (e.g., AVO, AVAf and other offset-dependent-reflectivity analysis). However, as seen in Fig. 4, where one of the offset bins of Fig. 3 is seen divided into multiple offset bins OB1 " OB8S the offset is so non-uniform that offset bin OB1 includes only one trace and bin OB7 contains thirteen. When the traces within the offset bins are stacked, the large variation detrimentally affects the analysis. This occurs because the variations created in normalizing the amplitude and noise components of the data, after stacking such non-uniform fold, influences one of the very attributes to be studied - amplitude.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an apparatus for providing common-offset bins, within a common mid-point bin, which are uniform in distribution.<br>
In conducting amplitude variation with offset analysis ("AVO') and amplitude variation with angle analysis ("AVA"), in three dimensional data sets, it is common to analyze the amplitude in a CMP only relative to offset, in a two-dimensional fashion, and assign a value or slope to the variation within that bin. No azimuth or directional information is preserved that would indicate the trend of variation within the bin. Therefore, amplitude variation trends across a 3D survey are not conducted, and there is a need for an apparatus for conducting<br>
and processing AVO and/or AVA analysis "m which trend information within the<br>
2<br><br>
survey bins is available. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODiMENXSjQ.EXffiiNVENII0N<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for generating e bin of common midpoint traces from a three dimensional seismic survey data set, each of the traces having a shot location and a receiver location associated therewith. The apparatus comprises a means for gathering from the data a plurality of traces having a common mid-point, whereby a common mid-point bin (e.g. any of bins BIN 1 - BIN 9 of Fig. 3) is defined and whereby each of the plurality of traces has an offset associated therewith. In Fig, 5, each of the traces of Fig. 3 is shown in a spider diagram, in which the offset and azimuth associated with each trace is displayed. The offset is represented by the length of the line representing the trace, and the azimuth is represented by the angle of the line. As seen in Fig, 6; which shows one of the CMP bins of Fig. 5, a coordinate set is assigned to the traces in the CMP bin. In this example, there is a constant fold of two traces per coordinate bin. Thus, from the coordinates assigned, the Offset and direction of a line between the shot and receiver is detenninable, and a coordinate-designated set of traces is defined.<br>
In the example embodiment shown, a plurality of the coordinate-designated set of traces have the same coordinates.  In this example, the acquisition geometry1 resulted in two traces populating each common-inline / common-crossline bin, and, according to a further embodiment of the invention, such traces are added to increase the signal to noise ratio. However, in alternative embodiments, there will be a unique set of coordinates per trace (i.e, a single trace per coordinate bin), and no adding will occur. It should also be noted that, in the example of Fig. 6, a Cartesian, set of coordinates is assigned.   However, other sets of coordinates are also acceptable, depending upon the pattern and fold of the CMP bin.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, the coordinate bin of Fig. 6 is divided into four quadrants (I -IV). H has been found that the raypaths for opposing quadrants I and III and quadrants II and IV are the same for many acquisition geometries. In a geometry as illustrated, the source and receiver locations are reversed for opposing quadrants. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, as seen in Fig, 8. the Cartesian bin is folded such that opposing quadrants are added, and common inline/crossline coordinate bins are produced, having.an increased fold (here, four). It will be understood that in one embodiment of the invention, the Cartesian coordinates have a first axis parallel to a receiver line and a second axis parallel to a shot line;<br>
6<br><br>
while, according to an alternative embodiment, the Cartesian coordinates have a first axis parallel to a shot line and a second axis parallel to a receiver line.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for generating a data set useful for performing analysis of reflection attribute (e.g. amplitude, frequency, phase) variation among traces. According to this aspect, it has been found that reflection attributes for the same reflection point vary, depending upon the raypath being detected. In some embodiments, the variation is analyzed by comparing the variation to the offset between the shot and the receiver detecting the reflection event; while, in other embodiments, the variation is compared as a function of the reflection angle at the event. In any case, on seismic data, thought to be reflected from the same location in the subsurface- In fact, the seismic data represents different offsets or angles of incidence. In such a point in one volume, the traces have a common reference assigned to them, and the traces represent recordings from shot-receiver pairs having various azimuth angles. Therefore, according to one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the apparatus comprises: a means for fitting a surface to the data of the traces within the window and a means for assigning a coordinate set to the surface, wherein the coordinate set is related to a survey geometry of the data. It has been found that a first order interpolation of the reflection attribute variation among the data is sufficient for many applications, although higher order interpolations will also suffice.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 9. as known in the art of two-dimensional AVA analysis, a "best fit'- line can be calculated having a y-axis of amplitude of traces within 2 window, an x-axis of angle of reflection, and a slope, representing the variation of amplitude with angle of incidence. To date, however, three-dimensional AVA or AVO analysis has not been useful, due in part to the lack of ability to provide azimuth information and to reduce the inconsistency in fold. According to one embodiment of the present invention, however, three-dimensional analysis is made possible.<br>
As seen in Fig. 10, a. first order approximation of a surface fit to the amplitude of traces in the bin of Fig. 8 is a cone, using a non-linear least squares algorithm. In cases in which there is an anisotropic effect to the amplitude response, the cone will be distorted into an elliptical cone, having a semi-minor axis "a1* and a semi-major axis ^b" (Fig 11), According to this embodiment, the semi-major axis is aligned with the azimuth of minimum gradient, and the semi-minor axis is aligned with the azimuth of maximum gradient.<br>
7<br><br>
Therefore, Fig. U is an example in which the major axis of the cone represents the azimuth direction having the lowest gradient in the reflection attribute, and the minor axis of the cone represents the azimuth direction having the highest gradient in the reflection attribute, in alternative embodiments, this convention is reversed. Further, it should be noted that in one embodiment of the apparatus just described, the common reference comprises a common mid-point; while, in embodiments in which dip-moveout or migration algorithms are applied, the common reference comprises a common-reflection point.<br>
In any case, according to a further aspect of the invention, offset values which have been assigned to a plurality of traces, and the reflection attribute variation between traces in the window are compared as a function of offset and azimuth. Again, in one example, the reflection attribute comprises amplitude. However, in other embodiments, frequency and/or phase is the reflection attribute under analysis. According to still further embodiments, instantaneous amplitude, instantaneous frequency, and/or instantaneous phase are viewed as a function of azimuth.<br>
Further still, in some embodiments the amplitude attribute analyzed ts p-%vave amplitude, while in other embodiments the attribute analyzed comprises s-wave amplitude. Phase and frequency attributes of p-wave and s-waves are analyzed according to still further embodiments.<br>
According to still further embodiments of the invention, the azimuth information made available is used to view trends of reflection attribute behavior across the survey, for example, in one embodiment, the AVO response of CMP bins is compared. Thus, generally stated, a data set of multiple bins of traces is provided, wherein a plurality of traces in the bin have a common, reference assigned thereto and wherein the traces represent recordings from shoit-receiver pairs having various azimuth angles. A. surface is fit to the data of the traces within the window, in each of the bins; a coordinate set is assigned to a plurality of the surfaces; and the surfaces of adjacent bins are tied,<br>
The above embodiments are provided by way of example only, and alternative embodiments will occur to those of skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention, as defined by the claims below.<br>
