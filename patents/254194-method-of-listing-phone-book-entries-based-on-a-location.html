				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to Mobile Handset Functionality, Handheld/Mobile devices like Mobile Phones, Smart Phones, PDA's and other wireless mobile gadgets. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of listing the phone book.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the currently available mobile devices, we have the conventional method of adding, listing of the phone book entries, and also the v-card style of adding entries and listing respectively. Also available is the minimal categorization of the phone book entries according the user groups like family, friends, VIP etc. The order of sorting and listing the phone book entries is normally alphabetical.<br>
Hence the user does not have much option of customizing the mobile phone entries according to his needs. Irrespective, of the usage the user has to use the all the phone book entries which in turn leads tedious searching process and also the sorting, resulting in consuming more time.<br>
The current procedure allows the user to add the entries to the phone book using the conventional methodology either in the phone memory or in the SIM memory. Some of the common problems have been identified below for the better illustration:<br>
•   MASS Storage capacities are available and all the entries are listed all the time.<br><br>
•<br>
•<br><br>
Sorting of the phonebook entries is time intensive, resulting in a complex sorting process.<br>
Search methodology is too expensive, and also the time consumed is more.<br>
Since all the entries are listed always, the search of a specific entry is complex, which in turn results in tedious search process.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The existing system of adding the phonebook entries into the Mobile Phones, Smart Phones, PDA's and other wireless mobile gadgets is the conventional methods by entering the name and telephone number and also some devices provide the facility of the v-card pattern. The contents of the phone of the phonebook entries can also be categorized according to the groups like family, friends, VIP etc. But the automatic listing of the particular section of the phonebook entries is not available.<br>
The present invention provides the categorization of the phonebook entries according to the respective zones/regions/country, where in the respective zones phonebook entries are listed on a need to usage basis. This also helps in improving the search methodologies to be faster and sorting the list is also quicker.<br>
The invention also provides a facility to access all the phonebook entries at any given point of time.<br>
The thought applied is invented keeping in view the entire mobile device's end users while in local and also roaming, wherein the phone book will be of effective use to them.<br>
The concept is to implement the phone book storage, zone wise/ region wise / country wise/ in addition to some common storage for important contacts like family, friends etc., to be available all the time.<br>
Once the user is in a particular zone / country, the respective zone's phone book entry will be enabled plus the common entries.<br>
This will be advantageous in categorizing the entries in the phone book wherein the storage capacities are huge.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method wherein the phone book can decide where the user is located and can list out the respective entries specific, to that<br><br>
particular Location / Zone / Region / Country.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method to organize the contacts as per the roaming, on a need to usage basis.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method wherein an automated listing of the Phone Book entries, with respect to, the Zone / Region / Country wherein the end user is located.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to method wherein the retrieval of a particular entry is easier and quicker as entries are categorized, thereby resulting in a diminutive time for searching.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of listing the phone book comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	introducing an additional field in each phonebook entry associated with a specific "IDENTITY" indicating the location;<br>
(b)	storing the phonebook entries based on the said location in the mobile device;<br>
(c)	storing the numbers which are used always in an additional common storage section in the said mobile device; and<br>
(d)	Automatically enabling and listing the phonebook entries specific to a location along with the numbers in the common storage when mobile device enters a particular location.<br>
When the mobile device is in a particular location, the respective information of the location is inferred from the carrier network. At any instant of time the mobile device user is provided with an option to access all the phonebook entries, irrespective of the location. The said mobile device uses a bunch of RF / Carrier sensors and an intelligence module to analyze the different locations to determine and list the exact phone book entries.<br>
A processing unit coupled with the phonebook listing and display module retrieves the respective location information resulting in listing the phonebook entries The processing is further coupled with the search module, to identify a specific entry from<br><br>
the current listing. When the mobile device enters a location and if the location is already known, the user is intimated about the respective regions phone book entries in the said location along with the common entries. When the mobile device enters a location and if the location is not already known, the user is intimated about all the common entries in the phonebook.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flowchart of various steps involved in the listing of the phone book entries according the location (region/zone/country). It shows how the phone book entries can be listed accordingly once the broadcast/service location information is received from the respective carrier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed invention is meant to impart some intelligence to the mobile device phone book storage. The thought applied is to implement the phone book storage, zone wise/ region wise / country wise/ in addition to some common storage for important contacts like family, friends etc. Once the user is in a particular zone /<br><br>
country / region, the respective zone's phone book entry will be enabled and listed in addition to the common entries.<br>
This will be advantageous in categorizing and also searching the entries in the phone book wherein the storage capacities are huge in number. Larger the number of records entered, more the time required for searching, hence the categorization of the phone book entries according to the respective regions/zones can be adapted.<br>
A bunch of RF/Carrier sensors and an intelligence module could do just that, by analyzing the different roaming locations to determine and list the exact phone book entries respectively as and when required.<br>
A processing unit coupled with the phonebook listing and display module, which in turn retrieves the respective location information as designed, resulting in listing the phonebook entries accordingly. The processing unit can also be further coupled with the search module, to identify a specific entry from the current listing.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flowchart of various steps involved in the listing of the phone book entries according the location (region/zone/country). It shows how the phone book entries can be listed accordingly once the broadcast/service location information is received from the respective carrier.<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart explains the working of the invention.<br>
The respective information of the location is inferred from the carrier network, for ex: in GSM/GPRS this information is retrieved from the Broadcast information given by the carrier network and in CDMA the information is retrieved from the Service Area Location Information from the carrier network. The location information is processed and the respective phonebook entry is listed.<br>
1. Phone Receives the Network Broadcast Info (GSM/GPRS) or Service Area Location Info (CDMA).<br><br>
2.	Check for the respective location in the Phone Book Entries, as per the<br>
Carrier/Network Info Received.<br>
3.	If the location is already known, intimate User about the location.<br>
4.	List the Respective Regions Phone Book Entries and also the common Entries for the known location.<br>
5.	If the location is not known do not Intimate User about the location.<br>
6.	List ail Phone Book Entries, irrespective of the regions if the location is not known.<br>
Example Scenario:<br>
One example scenario where this invention is of an effective usage, is for the Marketing Professionals who keep roaming between many location (cities/ states/ countries), and also having a huge contact list in there mobile phonebook.<br>
This invention introduces an additional field in each phonebook entry. The phonebook entry can be associated with a specific "IDENTITY" indicating the location i.e. Zone/ Region/ Country etc. using which the phonebook entries can be stored and listed accordingly.<br>
The invention provides the mobile device/handset user with the feature of categorizing his phone book entries in an organised way by facilitating to store the phonebook entries according to their respective zone/ region/ country into different sections. Additional to this a common section is available where in the user can store the numbers which is used always.<br>
Once the user is in a particular zone / country / region, the respective zone's phonebook entry will be enabled and listed in addition to the common entries. This feature is an automated process.<br><br>
The phonebook entry is associated with a specific "identity" indicating the location i.e Zone / Region/ Country etc. As the user is in a particular location (zone/region/country) the respective information of the location is inferred from the carrier network, for ex: in GSM/GPRS this information is retrieved from the Broadcast Information given by the carrier network and in CDI\/IA the information is retrieved from the Service Area Location Information from the carrier network. The location information is processed and the respective phonebook entry is listed.<br>
At any instant of time the mobile device user is provided with an option to access all the phonebook entries, irrespective of the zone/ region/ country.<br>
The mobile device/handset uses an intelligent approach in listing the phonebook entries rather than listing all the entries every time. Now the mobile user can avoid the tedious way of searching the phone book entries as the entries are smartly arranged and the same is advantageous while sorting or searching.<br>
This will surely be a product differentiator since the phonebook is the most essential utility of a mobile device/handset, and also does the major work in storing, sorting and categorization of the phone book entries.<br>
This Invention involves a minimal change in the phonebook structure and a simple algorithm for verifying the service location / broadcast information in identifying the location.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br>
