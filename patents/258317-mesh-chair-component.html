MESH CHAIR COMPONENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to chairs that include a mesh support surface, and<br>
more particularly, to the back rest, armrest, head rest, or seat of such a chair.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Chairs with backs comprising a mesh supporting surface forming a yieldable<br>
resilient surface that deforms when sat on have been previously known. It is believed<br>
that such structures provide the chair with greater comfort than chairs having backs or<br>
seats of a solid construction. One example of a mesh-type chair is found in United<br>
States Patent No. 6,059,368 to Stumpf et al<br>
Because the mesh used to cover seats and seat backs has been made of a single<br>
expanse of fabric stretched across a frame, seats and seat backs made from mesh have<br>
been limited to being substantially flat. A flat seat and back rest geometry, however,<br>
does not provide the user with the appropriate and adequate ergonomic support that a<br>
chair needs to provide. For instance, heretofore, mesh back rests have not provided<br>
users with lumbar support without the addition of some type of solid support<br>
structure. Similarly, heretofore, mesh seats have not provided users with a seat front<br>
that tapers down, commonly referred to as a waterfall, without the addition of some<br>
type of solid support structure. (See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,604,784 to Bosman, et al.)<br>
Consequently, chair manufacturers have not previously been able to provide the<br>
benefits of a mesh seat, arm rest, head rest, or back rest in a chair that provides the<br>
user with the appropriate ergonomic support.<br>
The missing ergonomic support in conventional mesh chairs is recognized, but<br>
attempts to solve the problem have centered on providing a solid structural<br>
component. For example, there is a product sold separately (under the name<br>
PostureFittm) to add lumbar support structure to the chair described in the Stumpf et<br>
al. '638 patent.<br>
The lack of appropriate ergonomic support in conventional mesh chairs is<br>
further illustrated by their inability to provide adequate support to the various shapes<br><br>
of users' bodies because of the uncontrolled stretch ability of the mesh. Mesh chairs<br>
were believed to provide superior comfort arising from the ability of the mesh to<br>
stretch to conform to the shape of the user's body. Such belief failed to recognize,<br>
however, that the uncontrolled stretch of the mesh also conformed to unhealthy<br>
seating conformations arising from, for example, poor posture, and failed to provide<br>
beneficial support where necessary, such as the lumbar area.<br>
In the non-analogous dressmaking art, it is known to use darts, eases, and<br>
other assists in order to create contours. Such contours are coordinated with the seam<br>
lines. For example, United States Patent No. 3,939,565 to Bush describes such<br>
arrangements. However, until now, it has not been known that darts, eases and other<br>
assists could be employed to obtain desirable and beneficial contours in a mesh chair<br>
component.<br>
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a chair having a mesh<br>
support surface where the mesh has a contour that adapts to the user's body. It would<br>
be further advantageous to provide such a chair in coordination with a contoured<br>
frame for the relevant portion of the chair.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a chair having at least<br>
one component comprising at least one membranous panel, wherein said component<br>
is beneficially contoured to support a user. Said contour can be provided by a<br>
component frame supporting said at least one membranous panel or by combining a<br>
plurality of panels to form the component.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
chair component comprising at least one membranous panel capable of displacement<br>
for accommodation of various body shapes.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the chair<br>
component, for example, the seat, arm rest, head rest, or back rest, is comprised of a<br>
plurality of panels. Typically, the chair component comprises three or more panels.<br>
It is preferred that the chair component of the present invention has no more than ten<br>
panels.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, each panel is cut, or otherwise<br>
formed, in a shape so that when the several panels are combined, together they form a<br>
chair component, such as a seat, back rest, or headrest that is capable of beneficially<br>
adapting to the user's shape.<br>
The several panels are capable of being combined in a conventional fashion.<br>
For example, the panels can be combined by sewing the panels together, by welding<br>
them together (such as by sonic welding), or by using an adhesive to bind the panels<br>
together. Typically, the chair component surface of the present invention has at least<br>
two straight or curvilinear seams. In a preferred embodiment, the seams are<br>
curvilinear. It is preferred that the chair component surface of the present invention<br>
has fewer than ten seams between panels.<br>
When the several panels are combined, such as in a back rest embodiment,<br>
they form a back rest that provides support to the seat user's back. For instance, a<br>
back rest made according to the present invention provides a mesh back rest having<br>
lumbar support without the necessity of an additional solid structure. Thus, a mesh<br>
back rest according to the present invention can have contours without a pad applying<br>
pressure to the mesh to achieve beneficial contours.<br>
As used herein, the term "panel contour" refers to a three dimensional shape of<br>
a chair component that results from the combination of a plurality of membranous<br>
panels. The "panel contour" differs from the three dimensional shape produced by a<br>
contoured frame.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the chair<br>
component comprises a single mesh panel covering a contoured component frame.<br>
According to this embodiment, the chair component is particularly useful as a chair<br>
seat. The seat is thus particularly adapted to be substantially contoured to the various<br>
users' body shapes and distribute pressure of the user's lower body.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the chair<br>
component comprises a head rest. According to this embodiment, the head rest<br>
comprises at least one mesh panel that is contoured to substantially conform to the<br>
shape of the user's head. Preferentially, the head rest comprises one or more panels.<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, a chair<br>
component, such as a seat, arm rest, back rest or head rest, is formed from a plurality<br>
of panels from a membranous material using a contoured component frame.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, mesh chair components are<br>
combined with other parts to form a chair. For example, a mesh seat according to the<br>
invention could be combined with a back rest and a plurality of legs to form a chair.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, one or more components of the chair can be a<br>
mesh component according to the invention.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a chair<br>
comprising a chair pedestal, a base mounted on the pedestal, a seat mounted on the<br>
base, and a back rest attached to the base. Preferably, the pedestal contains a height<br>
adjustment mechanism such as a gas spring. Additionally, the back rest could be<br>
pivotally connected to the base. In one such embodiment, the back rest is pivotally<br>
connected to the base at a point roughly corresponding to the lumbar region of a<br>
user's back. Obviously, such a base would require an upward extension so at to form<br>
the pivot connection in that area. Preferably, the back rest comprises at least three<br>
membranous panels. Further, the seat can also comprise one or more membranous<br>
panels.<br>
The present invention also encompasses further embodiments wherein there is<br>
provided a chair having at least one component comprising a contoured mesh panel.<br>
In one embodiment, the chair is a swivel chair comprising a base pivotally supporting<br>
a seat, optionally including a back, arms, and a head rest, wherein at least one of said<br>
seat, back, arms, and headrest is comprised of at least one contoured mesh panel. In<br>
another embodiment, the chair comprises four legs stationarily attached to a seat,<br>
optionally including a back and arms, wherein at least one of the seat, back, and arms<br>
comprise at least one contoured mesh panel.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of<br><br>
the invention are shown. Indeed, these inventions may be embodied in many different<br>
forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein;<br>
rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable<br>
legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
The present invention provides chair components, and chair made using the<br>
components, wherein the chair components include a mesh portion. The mesh chair<br>
components, such as chair seats, back rests, head rests, and chair arms, are particularly<br>
advantageous in that the mesh is beneficially contoured to provide ergonomic support<br>
to the user. Furthermore, the mesh chair components are particularly designed to be<br>
adaptable to the various body shapes of multiple users while still providing ergonomic<br>
support. The mesh chair components of the invention are particularly useful in that<br>
they can be incorporated into a number of various embodiments. For example, one or<br>
more of the mesh components of the invention can be incorporated into an office chair<br>
(such as including casters), a standard four-leg chair, household seating, public<br>
seating facilities (such as stadium seating, movie theatre seating, arena seating, and<br>
the like), public transportation seating (such as airplane seating, train seating, bus<br>
seating, and the like), professional service seating (such as a dental exam chair), and<br>
other similar or related seating apparatuses. The mesh chair components of the<br>
invention can also be incorporated into other types of vehicle seating, such as<br>
automobile seating. Accordingly, the present invention also encompasses all of the<br>
various seating embodiments described above incorporating at least one mesh<br>
component as described herein.<br>
Figure 1 shows a chair back rest 100 according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The periphery of the chair back rest 100 is a component frame 110,<br>
which includes an aperture 115. In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
aperture 115 is capable of receiving a pin, thereby allowing connection the chair back<br>
rest 100 to additional chair components, such as to an arm extending from a chair base<br>
(not shown).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 1, the mesh back rest<br>
is made from three mesh panels, namely right panel 120, center panel 130, and left<br>
panel 140. Right panel 120 and left panel 140 are substantially mirror images of one<br>
another; however, in further embodiments of the invention, this is not necessarily<br><br>
required. Center panel 130 has a shape that is substantially different from that of<br>
either right panel 120 or left panel 140. Preferably, center panel 130 is encouraged<br>
into an appropriate vertical contour by tension exerted by right panel 120 and left<br>
panel 140, to which center panel 130 is joined.<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention, the various panels, 120,130,<br>
and 140, can be adapted to form beneficial contours for receiving various users' body<br>
shapes. For example, where a raised contour is desired, as in the lumbar area, the<br>
width of right panel 120 and left panel 140, in proportion to center panel 130, is such<br>
that the tension on the panels from the force provided by the component frame 110<br>
lifts center panel 130 to the correct contour. In areas of the back rest 100 where it is<br>
beneficial to have contours that are less pronounced, such as, for example, in the area<br>
of the back rest 100 adaptable for receiving the shoulder area of a user, less tensile<br>
force is required. Accordingly, for such areas, right panel 120 and left panel 140 are<br>
narrower and center panel 130 is wider. This effect is illustrated in Figure 1, where<br>
center panel 130 is narrower in the lower area of the back rest 100 adaptable to the<br>
lumbar area of a user, and becomes wider in the upper area of the back rest 100<br>
adaptable to the shoulder area of a user.<br>
As provided by the above description, it is therefore possible, according to the<br>
invention, to prepare a mesh chair component, such as a back rest, having beneficial<br>
contours in desirable areas of the component. Accordingly, the invention allows for<br>
preparation of specialized components that are beneficially contoured for special<br>
needs users. Additionally, the chair components can be made to have contours in<br>
positions, such as generally in the lumbar region, that are beneficial for a wide range<br>
of users.<br>
The panels used to make the chair components of the invention, such as the<br>
back rest of the embodiment described above, can be made from any conventional<br>
membranous fabric. The panels are especially useful as a mesh fabric, such as nylon,<br>
polyester, or other synthetic or natural fibers or skins. For example, the panels can be<br>
made from leather that has been selectively perforated to substantially emulate a<br>
mesh-type material. As such, the perforations could be patterned or unpattemed to<br>
impart additional desirable qualities to the panels. Alternatively, the mesh fabric<br>
could be comprised of a blend of materials, such as a polyester/nylon blend.<br><br>
Desirably, each of the panels is made from the same type of fabric. In one particular<br>
embodiment of the invention, each of the panels is made from a polyester weave<br>
mesh.<br>
It is preferable that the material used in preparing the mesh component<br>
according to the present invention have a limited stretch ability. Accordingly, the<br>
material should have a stretch ability of less than about 10%, preferably less than<br>
about 8%, more preferably less than about 6%. It is generally preferred for the<br>
material to have a stretch ability on the order of about 5%. Such limited stretch<br>
allows for the most effective use of the contours generated according to the invention.<br>
The limited stretch allows for maintenance of the support generated by the contours<br>
while still providing the comfort of the mesh.<br>
One method of measuring the stretch ability of a membranous material is to<br>
take an about two by about twelve inch piece of the membranous material and hang<br>
the material vertically. An about twenty pound weight is attached to the bottom of the<br>
membranous material. After the weight/material combination has come to<br>
equilibrium (for example, after about a half hour), the length of the "stretched"<br>
material is measured and compared to the length of the material before the weight was<br>
applied. As used herein, a material is of limited stretch ability if the ratio of the<br>
length of the "stretched" material to the initial length is less than about 1.10,<br>
preferably less than about 1.08, more preferably less than about 1.06. A material of<br>
limited stretch ability particularly useful according to the invention has a ratio of<br>
around 1.05.<br>
It is further desirable that the membranous material not be pulled too tightly<br>
within the outer component frame. Given the benefits provided by the limited stretch<br>
ability of the material used in the invention, it is desirable to limit the stretching of the<br>
material during manufacture of the chair component, including insertion of the mesh<br>
into the outer component frame. In other words, pre-stretching of the material is not<br>
required since the limited stretch ability of the material in connection with the<br>
contouring of the panels provides sufficient tension without the need for pre-<br>
stretching.<br>
Generally speaking, in accordance with aback rest embodiment of the<br>
invention, the vertical radius at the lumbar area should be within the range of about 9<br><br>
inches to about 15 inches. Additionally, the horizontal radius at the lumbar area<br>
should be within the range of about 13 inches to about 16 inches and should be within<br>
the range of about 22 inches to about 26 inches at the shoulder area of the back rest.<br>
The use of limited stretch material is advantageous over the use of material<br>
having a greater stretch ability as it allows for displacement of the material, rather<br>
than stretching, which is more accommodative. Mesh material with a stretch ability<br>
that is not limited allows the material to conform to the position of the user, which<br>
facilitates, or even promotes, poor posture and ergonomically unsound seating. By<br>
use of limited stretch material, undesirable positions of the body are not possible as<br>
they would be with material having a greater stretch ability. Use of a material having<br>
limited stretch ability with modest tension across the component frame, as described<br>
above, allows for displacement of the material that accommodates the differing body<br>
shapes of various users while maintaining beneficial support. For example, a lumbar<br>
contour in a mesh back rest according to the present invention can adjust to the<br>
individual back shape and size of various users because the contour can be displaced<br>
to correspond to the area of the natural lumbar contour of the user, but the supportive<br>
contour of the mesh is maintained, thereby providing support, rather than just<br>
stretching without providing needed support.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, right panel 120 is joined to center panel<br>
130 by right seam 125 and center panel 130 is joined to left panel 140 by left seam<br>
135. Seams 125 and 135 can be made by any conventional method of joining the<br>
mesh fabric including, but not limited to, sewing, welding, and gluing. In one<br>
particular embodiment, the seams are joined by ultrasonic welding.<br>
The membranous material can be attached to the component frame by any<br>
conventional method. One preferred method is by attaching the material, such as by<br>
welding or gluing, to a flexible strip, such as a spline, and fitting the combination into<br>
a grove formed in the component frame. In one particular embodiment, the<br>
membranous material is sewn to a spline. The combination is generally fitted into the<br>
groove at a right angle to the direction of the tension on the material. The flexible<br>
strip used in attaching the material to the component frame can be made from any<br>
material commonly known for such uses, and is desirably a plastic-type extrusion,<br>
such as polyethylene or an equivalent.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows another view of the mesh component back rest according to<br>
the embodiment shown in Figure 1. Again, about the periphery of the back rest 100 is<br>
component frame 110, and within the component frame are right panel 120, center<br>
panel 130, and left panel 140. As in Figure 1, right panel 120 is joined to center panel<br>
130 by right seam 125, and center panel 130 is joined to left panel 140 by left seam<br>
135.<br>
Figure 3 shows back rest 100 of Figure 2 from the obverse view. Figure 3<br>
provides a more detailed view of the component frame 110 according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show one embodiment of the back rest 100 from the right and<br>
left sides. From these views, it can be seen that in this particular embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the component frame 110 has a curvature that provides additional<br>
contour to the back rest 100 so as to provide further support for the user. The<br>
curvature shown in these figures can be referred to as a side view curvature. As seen<br>
in each of these figures, this side view curvature begins at the bottom of the<br>
component frame. From the bottom, the frame goes, or curves, forward (shown as<br>
curvature 150). Subsequently, for example from about the lumbar region (which is<br>
about a quarter of the way up the chair back), the side view curvature inverts and<br>
heads backward (shown as curvature 160).<br>
Figures 6 and 7 provide top perspective views of the back rest 100 from the<br>
front and back. From these views, it can be seen that in this particular embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the component frame 110 has a top view curvature that provides<br>
further contour to the back rest 100 so as to provide additional support for the user.<br>
For instance, both the top and the bottom edges of the component frame 110 have a<br>
concave shape (170, and 180, respectively). The concave shape 180 of the bottom<br>
edge of the component frame 110 is not visible in Figure 6 due to the forward<br>
curvature of the component frame 110 discussed above.<br>
While the foregoing discussion has mainly described the invention in terms of<br>
a back rest, the present invention also lends itself to additional chair components.<br>
Accordingly, chairs could be made, according to the invention, having mesh<br>
components comprising further chair parts, such as, for example, a chair seat, a chair<br>
arm, or a head rest.<br><br>
Figure 8 provides a front perspective view of a chair seat 200 according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The periphery of the chair seat 200 is a<br>
component frame 210, which encompasses only three sides of the chair seat 200, thus<br>
having a substantially U-shaped conformation. The front edge 230 of the chair seat<br>
200 is devoid of framing in order to avoid a hardened area whereby pressure could be<br>
applied to the user's body. In this manner, a more comfortable seating arrangement is<br>
provided since the comfort of the mesh component extends through the front portion<br>
of the chair seat 200 without the need of an additional structural component that could<br>
act as a pressure point on the body of the user. According to this embodiment, the<br>
chair seat 200 is comprised of a single membranous panel 220.<br>
Figure 9 provides a side view of the chair seat 200. As seen in this<br>
embodiment, the component frame 210 maybe contoured (i.e. have a side view<br>
curvature) to improve the effect of the membranous panel 220 to distribute pressure of<br>
the user's lower body. Accordingly, the chair seat 200 preferably has an upward<br>
curvature 240 toward the front portion of seat 200 and preferably has a downward<br>
curvature 250 toward the middle and back of seat 200. Such curvatures can be<br>
advantageously designed to receive the lower body of a user in an ergonomically<br>
correct sitting position, evenly and comfortably distributing the pressure of the user's<br>
lower body. Preferentially, the curvatures of the chair seat 200 are designed for<br>
encouraging an ergonomically correct upright posture by the user.<br>
According to this embodiment, the panel 220 is stretched side-to-side across<br>
component frame 210 with a tension that, preferentially, is greater than the tension<br>
applied to the panels of a back rest according to the present invention. A greater<br>
tension is preferred in the chair seat embodiment over the back rest embodiment as<br>
the chair seat must support the weight of the user. Further, the chair seat generally<br>
relies on the particular contouring of the component frame, while in the back rest<br>
embodiment, support is also provided by the contours formed by the multi-panel<br>
construction.<br>
It is also preferred that the front edge 230 of the chair seat 200 have a<br>
"waterfall" effect. This effect can be achieved by appropriate contouring of the front<br>
edges of the side portions of component frame 210. For example, it is desirable that<br><br>
the side portions of component frame 210 be radiused downward about 1 to about 1.5<br>
inches at the front portions.<br>
While the foregoing discussion describes the invention in terms of individual<br>
chair components, one or more of the components can be incorporated into a chair<br>
according to the invention. A chair according to the present invention can include a<br>
mesh seat according to the above embodiment. Alternatively, a chair according to the<br>
present invention can include a seat comprising a standard cushion and upholstery.<br>
Either seat embodiment could be included in a chair comprising a back rest<br>
comprising contoured mesh panels as described herein.<br>
Figure 10 provides a front perspective view of a head rest 300 according to the<br>
present invention. The periphery of the head rest 300 is a component frame 310.<br>
Preferentially, the component frame 310 is contoured to improve the effect of the<br>
panel 320 in receiving the head of the user. According to the embodiment of Figure<br>
10, the component frame 310 has a forward curvature 350 along the horizontal axis.<br>
The head rest, as shown in the embodiment of Figure 10, can have a single mesh<br>
panel 320 attached to component frame 310. Alternately, the head rest can have a<br>
plurality of panels, such as in the back rest embodiment described above. Desirably,<br>
when the head rest is comprised of a plurality of panels, the panels are attached such<br>
that when they are combined, they are contoured for substantially conforming to the<br>
head of a user. For example, a head rest according to this embodiment may be<br>
contoured such that it provides support at the base of the head of the user in the neck<br>
region while also receiving the more rounded back portion of the user's head. In<br>
further embodiments, the component frame of the head rest component can also have<br>
a curvature varied from the embodiment of Figure 10 but beneficial for receiving the<br>
contoured, multi-panel mesh.<br>
The head rest of the present invention is further illustrated in Figure 11, which<br>
provides a front view of the head rest. Accordingly, this view illustrates a single<br>
mesh panel 320 stretched across the component frame 310. A side view of the head<br>
rest 300 along lines A-A is provided in Figure 11 A, which further illustrates the<br>
forward curvature 350 of the component frame 310 in this embodiment of the<br>
invention. Also shown according to Figure 11 A, the head rest 300 further comprises<br>
apertures 315 and 317 for receiving pins for attachment to supports (not shown). A<br><br>
top view of the head rest 300 along lines B-B of Figure 11 is provided in Figure 11B,<br>
which illustrates optional additional backward curvature 360 along the vertical axis.<br>
The additional curvature allows for maximizing the contouring ability of the head rest<br>
for receiving the head of a user and providing beneficial support.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates one embodiment of a chair according to the present<br>
invention. According to Figure 12, there is provided a chair 400 having a front<br>
support piece 410 and two rear support pieces 420 and 422. According to the<br>
embodiment shown, the front support 410 is a single shaped piece acting as two front<br>
leg pieces and as a frame support for attachment of the seat frame 430. In alternate<br>
embodiments, the front support 410 could comprise two separate members as front<br>
leg pieces. As shown in Figure 12, the seat frame 430 is substantially U-shaped<br>
having no support member along the front edge of the seat frame 430, which is<br>
beneficially contoured for supporting a user's body and covered by mesh 440.<br>
The rear support pieces 420 and 422 function as two rear leg pieces and are<br>
preferentially attached to the front support piece 410 for added stability. In the<br>
present embodiment, the rear support pieces 420 and 422 are further adapted for use<br>
as arm supports 450 and 452. The rear support pieces 420 and 422 are also useful as<br>
supports for the back rest 460. The back rest 460 is preferentially designed to be<br>
interchangeable between different chair embodiments. Thus, the back rest 460 is<br>
preferentially made according to the embodiments previously described according to<br>
the present invention. As shown in Figure 12, the back rest 460 comprises only a<br>
single mesh piece. However, the invention preferentially encompasses embodiments<br>
wherein the back rest 460 comprises multiple mesh pieces as described herein.<br>
Various modifications to the chair according to Figure 12 could be made and<br>
are envisioned by the present invention. For example, in another embodiment, chair<br>
400 could be made without the arms 450 and 452. In such embodiment, rear support<br>
pieces 420 and 422 would preferentially terminate at some point along seat back 460.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the back rest could be a mesh component according to the<br>
present invention and the chair seat could be a conventional seat, such as a hard<br>
surface covered by foam or other padded cushioning.<br>
Additional chair embodiments are also envisioned by the present invention.<br>
For example, a chair according to the invention could comprise a pedestal, such as<br><br>
one having a plurality of outwardly extending support arms. Such support arms could<br>
further comprise components for facilitating movement of the chair, such as casters.<br>
Preferentially, the pedestal includes a height adjustment mechanism. In one particular<br>
embodiment, the height adjustment mechanism is a gas spring. The pedestal could<br>
further comprise a base attached thereto capable of supporting and having attached<br>
thereto additional chair components. For example, a back rest according to the<br>
present invention could be pivotally connected to the base, such as through a pivot<br>
connecting member extending upward from the base. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
back rest is pivotally connected to the base at a point roughly corresponding to the<br>
lumbar region of a user's back. Further, the base could support a chair seat. In one<br>
embodiment, the chair seat is a mesh chair seat according to the present invention. In<br>
another embodiment, the chair seat is a conventional chair seat.<br>
The present invention also encompasses further embodiments wherein there is<br>
provided a chair having at least one component comprising a contoured mesh panel.<br>
In one embodiment, the chair is a swivel chair comprising a base pivotally supporting<br>
a seat. The chair can optionally include a back rest, arms, and a head rest, wherein at<br>
least one of the chair seat, back rest, arms, and headrest is comprised of at least one<br>
contoured mesh panel.<br>
Many modifications and other embodiments of the inventions set forth herein<br>
will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which these inventions pertain having<br>
the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated<br>
drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the inventions are not to be limited to<br>
the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific<br>
terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and<br>
