				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a ready to use dry onion mix composition and process thereof. The composition is useful as secondary ingredient for different food preparation like, sambar, curry, sauces, culinary products or for the preparation of nutraceuticals and also to a method for the preparation of the dry onion mix composition.<br>
Background and Prior Art Description of the Invention<br>
Onion contains: moisture-86.8%, protein-1.2%, fat- 
Reference may be made to the patent in which comminuted onion and garlic extracts are mixed with an aqueous extract of amylodextrin and dried to yield a powder having little onion or garlic colour until dissolved in hot water (Japanese-Patent, 4 828 065 (4828065), 1973).<br>
Reference may be made to seasoning compositions compositions based on mixtures of garlic powder and paprika, and may be blended with other seasonong ingredients such as onion powder, salt, black pepper or monosodium glutamate (United-States-Patent, 3756833, 1973).<br>
Reference may be made to the patent in which onion flakes were used alongwith bacon oil, dehydrated fruit, sunflower seeds, nuts etc., for the preparation of textured vegetable protein (United-States-Patent, 3 959 500 (3959500), 1976).<br>
Reference may be made to sources of onion flavouring i.e., dehydrated whole onion, onion powder, enzymatically prepared onion oil and onion extracted (oleoresins), besides fresh onion which poses storage problems, are discussed. All these products are used in commercially produced comminuted meat products, e.g., beefburgers, pate and spreads (Heath-HB, Meat-; 54 (5)43-45, 1981).<br><br><br><br><br>
Reference may be made to effect of irradiation on microbial, organoleptic quality and chemical composition of commercial onion powders with different doses was discussed (Silberstein-O; Henzi-W; Penniman-J; Bednarczyk-A; Eiss-M; Galetto-W; Welbourn-J, International-Congress-of-Food-Science-&amp;-Technoiogy-Abstracts; p. 139, 1978).<br>
Reference may be made to the main processed onion products and their methods of preparation which were described under the headings: dehydrated onion pieces (light coloured, and toasted); onion powder (air dried, and spray-dried); onion flavourings (sterile onion juice, and onion extracts on inert carriers); and pickled onions. (Gummery-CS, Food-Trade-Review; 47 (8) 452-454, 5 ref. , 1977). Reference may be made to a new method for processing dried onions and root vegetables into powder and qualitative changes during storage. It is recommended that raw material with a moisture content of 6-7% is used when milling the dry vegetables. Deterioration in the quality of powdered onions during storage was due to changes in consistency, i.e. lumping. Addition of 1.5-2% of calcium stearate, which suppresses lumping, substantially prolonged the storage time. It is recommended that onion powder should be packaged in hermetically sealed jars or tins. Keeping time is 12 months. In the case of root vegetables, deterioration is shown by a loss of typical smell and colour. The root vegetables should be packaged in the same way as dried onions. Storage life is 16 months (Granovskaya-RYa; Korneva-Lya, Trudy,-Vsesoyuznyi-Nauchno-issledovatel'skii-Institut-Konservnoi-i-Ovoshchesushil'noi-Promyshlennosti; 17, 10-20, 1973). Reference may be made to produce high quality onion powder by osmotic drying and to determine the effects of various packaging materials (11DPE and LDPE; 200 and 400 gauge) on storage stability and shelf life of osmotically dried onion powder. 5 mm thick onion slices were subjected to osmotic treatment in salt solutions (5, 10, 15 and 20%) for 6 h prior to drying in a cabinet drier at 60 degree C for 10 h. Ground dried onions were stored at room temp. (18-35 degree C; 50-60% RH) or low temp. (7 degree C; 85% RH) for up to 6 months and analysed for physicochemical and sensory properties. 15% salt solution was found to be the optimal osmotic treatment for dried onion quality. At low storage temp., all onion powder samples were of acceptable quality after 6 months of storage regardless of the packaging material used. At room temp., shelf life and pungency was highest in powders stored at 7 degree C in 200 gauge HOPE pouches, next highest was samples in 400 gauge LDPE pouches followed by those in 200 gauge LDPE pouches. For<br>
onion powder with 3.85% moisture content, optimal storage RH was 47.5%. It is concluded that osmotically dried onion powder should be stored at low temp., in high gauge polyethylene pouches in order to maximize shelf life and quality. (Sagar-VR, Journal-of-Food-Science-and-Technology,-India; 38 (5) 525-528, 16 ref., 2001). Reference may be made to solar drying of onion flakes was discussed. Suitability of various solar driers for drying of sliced white onions was investigated and a comparison made with mechanical and air drying. Influence of sulphitation on colour retention by dried onion flakes also was investigated. Data on physicochemical characteristics of white onions are presented. Drying rate was fastest for mechanical cabinet drier followed by matrix bed air heater, rock type air heater (both solar driers) and open air drying. Sulphitation with 0.25% potassium metabisulphite for 5 min prevented pink discoloration of flakes dried in solar driers, (i) Sulphited slices needed less time for drying than the (ii) control samples in all types of solar driers. Retention of ascorbic acid was greater in (i) than in (ii). Solar dried samples retained slightly less ascorbic acid than mechanically dried samples. Browning was less pronounced in (i) than in (ii). Increase in browning was observed in all samples during storage but (i) showed a smaller increase. A progressive decrease in ascorbic acid and increase in reducing sugars as well as total sugars was observed during storage. The decline in ascorbic acid content during storage was greater in (i) than in (ii). In sensory evaluation, (i) from various solar driers received max. scores for colour, texture and overall acceptability. (Powar-VN; Singh-NI; Dev-DK; Kulkarni-DN; Ingle-UM, Indian-Food-Packer; 42 (1) 15-28,15 ref., 1988).<br>
