COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"DOSING PUMP"<br>
LUTZ-PUMPEN  GMBH  8   CO.   KG,   of Erlenstr.   5-7,   97877  Wertheim, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
IN/PCT/2002/1830/MUM<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
30-8-2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a dosing pump.<br>
GB 2 303 925 A discloses a damping system for an exemplary conventional  oscillating  pump.    The  feed  of the   pump,   whose configuration dictates that the feed is a surge-type feed, should be compensated by the damping so as to make possible a sufficiently uniform   feed  flow  which  then  makes  possible   an  approximate measurement of the feed amount. The damping means engenders an additional effort and,  despite its. damping effect,  does not make possible an exact measurement of the feed flow. In particular, the feed flow is not in a direct relation to the drive movement of the pump so that the damping means and measurement means are indispensable. The pump itself thu$ is not a dosing pump.<br>
' Fr 1 555 291 discloses a pump of the type set forth in the introductory portion of claim 1 which is, in any event, a vibration pump. The pump comprises acylindrical chamber in which a piston fanned of magnetizable material is moveably disposed.   Non-return or one-way valves opening in the feed direction are disposed in art inlet into the chamber, in the'piston, and in an outlet out of the chamber; The piston is set into oscillation by an excitation winding supplied with alternating current At the same time, the piston is biased in the feed direction by a spring.   In connection with excitation of the excitation winding, the piston feeds the dose liquid in a surge-type manner.   At the least because of this reason, this conventional pump is not suitable as a dosing pump.   Moreover, incomplete sealing between the piston and the surrounding wall is unavoidable so that the respective feed stroke does not correlate with the piston stroke. Also, this is another reason that this conventional pump is not suitable as a dosing pump.<br><br>
Dosing pumps are commonly known. They serve for the dosed transport and. in particular, for the uniform dosed transport of a dose liquid into a deferent medium such as. for example, water The dosing<br>
pumps comprise a chamber with an inlet valve in an inlet ,nto the chamber and an outlet valve in an outlet of the chamber. A portion of the wall of the chamber is formed by a membrane which is moved back and forth by a drive device.   In a movement in the nature of an enlargement of the volume of the chamber, dose liquid is drawn ,in by ction through the inlet valve into the chamber wh.le, ,n connection a movement of ft. membrane in the reverse direction the volume of the chamber reduces and. thus, dose liquid is advance   out of the chamber through the outlet valve, where it is thereafter conducted via a conduit to a desired location.<br>
A disadvantage of a conventional dosing pump of this type is that  the.introduction of the dose .lquid into the chamber during a suction intake process takes a comparatively long time while during tha time no dose liquid reaches the outlet valve into the.outlet  and exits therethrough. On the other hand, during the switch over mto the . discharge process in connection with which the dose  liquid is -discharged  via the outlet, valve as a result of a reduction ,in the volume of the chamber,the entirety of the dose liquid in the conduit leading to the inlet valve goes into a still condition in a spasmodic manner as a result of the closing of the inlet-valve, which is disadvantageous from the standpoint of the pump process, the production of noise, and incurring wear.<br>
The invention provides a solution to the challenge of providing a dosing pump of the relevant art which makes possible a uniform, and, in particular, a surge-free and low noise, feed of dose liquid.<br>
The solution provided by the Invention is found in the teachings set forth in the features recited in claim 1.<br><br>
Literal Translation of ?CT/EP01/06278 Amendmcr.te dated 29 AuSust 2002<br><br>
The core concept of these teachings is that the volume of the chamber during the pump process is allowed to basically always remain   substantially   unchanged   and,   consequently,   to   thereby substantially prevent surges and/or variations of the feed work - that is,   both during the suction intake of dose liquid as well as during the discharge thereof out of the chamber - and this feed work is achieved in that, within the chamber, a separation means is provided which partitions the chamber into two partial chambers, the separation means having a separation valve therein which closes in connection with movement of the separation means in the  pump direction.    The separation means is moveable back and forth in the pump direction. When the separation means is moved by a drive device in the. direction of the inlet valve, the dose liquid remains in the chamber - that is, the dose liquid in both partial chambers remains in a still condition - and solely the separation means moves, the separation means moving through the substantially still dose liquid in the direction toward the inlet valve. Since, in total, there is no dose liquid movement, this movement of the separation means in the direction toward the inlet valve can be substantially surge-free and force-free and can, in particular, occur very rapidly with the result that the time required for this process can be as short.as possible as. can be, as well, the time during which no dose, liquid is discharged through the outlet valve into the outlet.<br>
After the separation means has approached the inlet valve in this manner, it is driven in the reverse direction - that is, in the feed direction - which fhen occurs in the slow and uniform manner desired in connection with a dosing pump, so that, via this slow and uniform type of pumping the dose liquid is controllably discharged out of the outlet valve into the outlet and, at the same time, is drawn in by suction through the inlet valve into the adjacent partial chamber.<br>
Once   the   separation   means   has   reached   its   outermost movement point in the direction toward the outlet valve, it is again<br>
Literal Translation of PCT/EPO1/06278 Amendments dated 29 August 2002<br><br>
moved through the substantially still dose liquid in the chamber in the direction toward the outlet valve, whereupon the movement process is again reversed in that the separation means is moved again at the desired dosing process speed in the direction toward the outlet valve.<br>
Since, during the return movement of the separation means against the pump direction in the direction toward the outlet valve, practically   no   dose   liquid   is   moved,   the   return   process   can consequently be performed very rapidly so that, in the extreme case, the feed process is practically uninterrupted.   The process is to be understood as encompassing the concept that the separation means, together with the assistance of its separation valve, "advances" the dose liquid into the chamber and, after a short return movement, again performs the "advancing process".   The dosing and pump process follows, therefore, in a uniform and substantially surge-free manner. Further advantages  are  obtained, in  the form  of reduced   noise development.and reduced wear.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the partial chambers comprise outer walls which are aligned with one another, are substantially cylindrical and are variable in the extension thereof in the axial direction, whereby the separation meansiis configured as a separation part sealingly connected with the outer walls and in which, preferably, the separation valve is co-axially disposed and the separation means is operatively connected with the drive device. In this embodiment, sliding parts and the wear associated therewith Is avoided.<br>
By virtue of the sealing connection of the separation part with the outer walls of the chamber, no unsealed locations are present between the partial chambers so that the feed stream exactly corresponds to the movement of the separation part. The inventive pump is suitable to a high degree as a dosing pump.<br>
Literal Translation of PCT/EPO1/06278 Amendments dated 29 August 2002<br><br>
The substantially cylindrical walls of the partial chambers can be configured as tube parts extendible and/or compressible in the axial direction which are, preferably, bellows-shaped.<br>
In order to avoid a cross-sectional enlargement or a cross-sectional constriction of the tube parts during the pump process, the tube parts comprise, in furtherance of this purpose, means which is not extendible in the circumferential direction which can be configured as reinforcement, disposed in the tube parts and preferably formed of cross cord web, which is not extendible in the circumferential direction. Another embodiment of the invention is comprised of non-extendible means configured by connected rings disposed at axial spacings from the cylindrical outer walls, the rings preferably being arranged on the outer sides of the outer walls.  The rings can be formed of a suitable selected material such as, for example, synthetic material or plastic. A further configuration provides, however, that the rings are formed of metal and are connected with the outer sides of the tube parts by vulcanization. This configuration is simple and, thus, can be produced in a cost-favorable manner.<br>
In a bellows-shaped embodiment of the substantially cylindrical outer walls, the rings are disposed to best advantage on the respective narrowest and widest locations of the bellows.<br>
The drive device can be basically configured as desired. In accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the separation part along with a drive part formed of hard material is<br><br>
Literal Translation of. PCT/EPO1/06278 Amendments daied 29 August 2002<br><br>
connected with an outer threaded winding that extends co-axial to the pump direction, the outer threaded winding being in force transmission engagement with an inner threaded winding via a transmission part which is rotatably driven by the drive device. In this manner, means for cyclical reversal of the rotation direction of the transmission part is provided so that, after a rotational movement and a winding movement of the transmission part in the feed direction, there follows a return movement of the separation piece in opposition to the feed direction -that is, movement is effected via a winding movement moving the separation part in the feed direction and in opposition to.the feed direction.<br>
With respect to the above-noted drive of the separation part by means of a winding transmission, the drive device is, in furtherance of this purpose, configured as a rotation drive device, whereby the transmission part is connected with the rotor of the rotation drive device or is formed by the rotor of the rotation drive device. The rotation drive device is, consequently, in furtherance of this purpose, a rotary step motor which makes possible an exact specification of the rotation direction and the rotation speed and, therefore, an exact specification of the dose amount per unit time.<br>
The outer threaded winding of the separation part is in force    transmission engagement. with the  inner threaded winding  via  a transmission part configured as roller elements to further the goal of avoiding friction in the winding operation.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the roller elements can be balls with which the outer threaded winding and the inner threaded winding are complementarily configured. In this embodiment, the separation part and the transmission part form a ball gear drive which works in a low friction and low noise manner. In correspondence with the respective requirements, the ball gear drive can comprise an<br>
Litem.) Translation of PCT/EP01/06278 filed June I, 2001'- Gerhard Jesse- 623/001<br><br>
external ball return path or an internal ball return path.<br>
It is also possible, however, to configure the transmission part with an inner threaded winding and the separation part with radial grooves, whereby the inner threaded winding and the radial grooves  have the profile of V - windings or threads, and with the roller elements being roller-shaped and comprising radial grooves whose profile is complementarjly configured with respect to the profiles of the inner threaded winding and the radial grooves of the separation part. This embodiment comprises a roller winding drive which likewise works in a low friction and low noise manner.<br>
An operationally fundamentally different embodiment of the drive device comprises an electro-magnetic pull magnet whose anchor is connected with the separation part or is formed by the separation part and biased via a spring against the pull direction of the pull magnet. In response to electric loading of the electric pull magnet, this pull magnet is moved rapidly with the separation means in the feed direction in the direction toward the outlet valve so that dose liquid is discharged out of the outlet and the desired feed work is achieved.   Thereafter, the electric load to the electro-magnetic pull magnet is again interrupted so that the separation means is moved via the force of the spring, which is dependent upon the strength of the spring, in opposition to the feed direction,.<br>
The  invention  is  described  in  further  detail   hereafter  in connection with the figures of the drawings.<br>

Figure 1 shows a sectional view through an inventive dosing pump in which, in the interest of a more clear illustration of the embodiment, a drive device thereof has been omitted. The dosing pump comprises a partial chamber 2 into which, via an inlet valve-6 with two valve balls 8 and 10, communicates an inlet 4. The inlet valve<br>
Literal Translalion of PCT/EPO1/06278 filed June 1, 2001 - Gerhard Jesse - 623/001<br><br>
6 is arranged in a cylindrical inlet component 12, The free end of a tube part 16 is clamped in a sealing manner between the inlet part 12 and a cylindrical clamping part -14, the tube part 16 forming the outer wall of the partial chamber 2.<br>
An outlet side of the dosing pump is configured identically to, and disposed in opposition to, this so-configured inlet side of the dosing pump, the outlet side comprising a partial chamber 18 into which is communicated, via an outlet valve 22 with valve balls 24 and . 26, an outlet 20 leading to a non-illustrated outlet conduit. The outlet valve 22 is formed in an outlet part 28 and the free end of a tube part 32 is sealingly clamped between the outlet part 28 and a cylindrical damping part 30 enclosing the tube part. The tube part 32 forms the outer wall of the partial chamber 18,<br>
A separation part 34 is disposed between the partial chamber 2 and  the partial  chamber 18, the separation part being  sealingly connected with an intermediate tube part 36 which, together with the tube parts 16 and 32, is formed of a single piece. A separation valve 38 is formed in the separation piece 34 having two valve balls 40 and 42.  The intermediate tube part 36 is encircled by the separation part 34 to thereby be disposed in a sealing -and- frictiorially cohnected or cross fit connection with a drive part 44.   In the position illustrated in Figure 1, the drive part 44, along'with the inner separation part 34, is disposed at the same spacing between the inlet part 12 and the outlet part 28.<br>
During the operation of the illustrated dosing pump, the drive part 44 is moved in a back and forth manner between the inlet part 12 and the outlet part 28 by a drive device, which is not shown in this illustration, such that, in an alternating manner, the partial chamber 22 is enlarged and the partial chamber 18 is reduced and, during a stroke in the opposite direction, the partial chamber 22 is reduced and the<br>
Literal Translation cf PCT/EPO1/06278 Filed June 1, 2001 - Gerhard JesJt - 623/001<br><br>
partial chamber 18 is enlarged.<br>
Figure 2 shows the dosing pump shown in Figure 1 in a position in which the partial chamber 2 is enlarged and the partial chamber 18 is reduced. To effect the discharge of the dose liquid via the outlet 20, the drive part 44, along with the separation piece 34, is moved rapidly in a pump or feed direction indicated in the drawing by an arrow 45 -that is, in the direction toward the outlet part 28. In this connection, the separation valve 38 moves into a closed position so that the dose liquid is transported  out of the partial  chamber 18  and,  thereafter,  is discharged via the outlet 20 and, at the same time, dose liquid is drawn by suction into the partial chamber 2. The finish position which is thus reached is shown in Figure 3.   It can be seen that, via the constant back and forth movement of the drive part 44, dose liquid is drawn by suction into the partial chamber 2 and, consequently, dose liquid is transported out of the partial chamber 18, while, during movement in the opposite direction of the drive part 44, which follows rapidly to advance this purpose, dose liquid flows out of the partial chamber 2 into the partial chamber 18.   It is significant that,   in this respect, the dose liquid is neither moved through the inlet valve 6 nor through the outlet valve 22 during movement of the drive part in opposition to the feed direction45and, consequently-, due to the rapid movement of the: drive part 44, the dose liquid is only in a still condition for a short time period, leaving aside that dose liquid flows out of the dose partial chamber 2 into the partial chamber 18 through the separation valve 38 which is open at that time.<br>
During movement in the opposite direction of the drive part 44 in the direction toward the outlet 20 - that is, in the feed direction 45 - an advancement of the dose liquid is effected, in that dose liquid is drawn by suction into the partial chamber 2 and is moved out of the partial chamber 18. Since, during the movement of the drive part. 44 in the direction toward the inlet 4, the dose liquid in the inlet conduit and in<br>
Literal Translation of PCT/EPO1/06278 filed June 1,2001 - Gerhard Jesse - 623/00!<br><br>
the outlet conduit is in a still condition, no surge - type feed movement occurs that would result in a large operational still time. Since no feed movement occurs during the movement of the drive part 44 in the direction toward the inlet 4, leaving aside the overflow of the dose liquid out of the partial chamber 2 into the partial chamber 18, a corresponding movement of the drive part 44 can occur very rapidly in the desired manner so that the entire feed process is only interrupted for a short time. As a consequence thereof, there occurs a substantially uninterrupted uniform feed movement as is desired in connection with dosing pumps.<br>
Figure 4 shows an embodiment identical to that shown in Figure 1 with the difference that the tube part 16 and the tube part 32 are, in part, not shown in cut-away view and, therefore, cross cord webs 46 and 48 can be seen which prevent a ballooning out or inflation of the tube parts 16 and 32 under pressure and, consequently, in connection with movement of the drive part 44, there only occurs a compressive or extension movement of the tube parts 16 and 32 with the result that the variation of the volumes of the  partial chambers 2 and '8  and, correspondingly,  the required amount of dose  liquid' as  well,  is substantially proportional to the movement of the drive part 44,<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment identical to that of the dosing pump shown in Figure 1 in which identical parts are indicated with the same   reference   numerals.      A   difference   exists   between   the embodiments in that the tube parts 16 and 32 are, in part, not shown in cut-away view so as to thereby permit a better view of the. rings 50 and 52 which encircle the tube parts  16 and 32 and are connected therewith via vulcanization.    These rings 50 and 52 prevent, in the same manner as the cross  cord web 46 shown  in  Figure 4,  a ballooning out or inflation of the tube parts 16 and 32 but also, at the same time, prevent a pulling together or contraction of these tube parts 16 and 32, so that, during each movement of the drive part 44, the<br>
Literal Translation of PCT/EP0V06278 filed June I, 2001 - Gerhard J«s
 <br>
variation of the volumes of the partial chambers 2 and 18 is exactly proportional to the movement of the drive part 44.<br>
Figure 6 shows a modification of the embodiment shown in Figure 5. Identical parts or corresponding parts are again indicated with the same reference numerals. The difference between the illustrated embodiments is that the tube parts 16, 32 shown in Figure 6 are configured in bellows-like configurations, whereby rings 54 are disposed on the narrowest locations and rings 56 are disposed on the widest locations of the bellows. In this embodiment, due to the bellows-like configuration of the tube parts 16, 32, a particularly easy moveability of the drive part 44 in the movement direction is provided.<br>
Figure 7 shows a dosing pump of the embodiment shown in Figure 5 together with a drive device which compromises a' rotary step motor 58, also designated as a dose motor, having excitation windings 60. 62 and a rotor 68 supported on ball bearings 64, 66, the cylindrical inner surface of the rotor having an inner threaded winding 70 that, together with an outer threaded winding 72, operationally engages the correspondingly configured outer surface of the drive part 44.    In connection with corresponding excitation of the rotary; step motor 58,          the inner threaded wining 70 effects movement as outer threaded winding 72 and, consequently, movement as well of the drive part 44 in a direction which is dependent upon the direction of the electrical load, while, during corresponding different electric loading, a movement of the drive part 44 in the opposite direction is effected.   Via constant change of the electric load and, therefore, of the rotation direction of the rotary step motor, the drive part 44 is correspondingly moved back and forth and the feed work is accomplished in the basic manner described with respect to Figures 1-3.   The rotational speed of the rotary step motor and, consequently, the speed of movement of the drive part 44 in both directions, can be chosen in consideration of the feed    operation   described    with    respect   to    Figures    1-3    and<br>
Literal Translation of PCT/EP01/06278 filed June I, 2001 - Gerhard Jesse - 623/001<br><br>
accommodated thereto.<br>
Figure 8 shows the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5 in the same manner as the embodiment is shown in Figure 7 with, however, a second embodiment of a drive device.' In this connection, to the extent there are components identical to those shown in Figure 7 by virtue of the use of the rotary step motor 58, the same reference numerals are used.    The difference between the embodiment shown in Figure 6 relative to that shown in Figure 7 is that the transmission of the winding movement is effected via rolling elements configured as balls 74 which move in a guided manner in correspondingly complementary formed grooves 76 in the rotor 68 and 78 so as to engage a transmission part 8Q, whereby, in the transmission part 80, passages are provided in a conventional manner through which the balls enter into a space 82 formed behind the transmission part 80 and can alternatingly travel in opposite directions such that there occurs a continuous circulation of the balls 74.<br>
Figure 9 shows in individual detail, in a cross-sectional view thereof, a modification of the roller element transmission shown in Figure 8.   The same or corresponding parts are indicated with the same referencevnumerals An inner-threaded winding 84 is formed in the cylindrical inner surface of the rotor 68 while radial grooves 86 are formed in the outer surface of the drive part 44.   The inner-threaded winding  84 and the grooves 86  have the profile of V-windings. Substantially cylindrical, roller-shaped roller elements 88 are disposed between the windings 84 and the grooves '86, the circumferential surface of the roller elements being provided with radial grooves and peaks complentarily configured with respect to the profiles of the windings 84 and the grooves 86 such that, during rotation of the rotor 68, the roller elements 88 travel in a rolling manner along the winding path and, consequently, an axial movement of the drive part 44 is effected.<br>

Figure 10 is a transverse sectional view of the embodiment shown in Figure 9, It can be seen that the roller-shaped roller elements 88 are maintained at a spacing to one another in the circumferential direction by a cage 90,<br>
Figure 11 shows the embodiment shown in Figure 5 of the pump together with a third embodiment of a drive device. This drive device comprises, in this configuration, an electro-magnetic pull magnet with an excitation winding 92 and a pull anchor 94 which is connected with the drive part 44 and biased via a spring 96 in a direction in opposition to the pull direction of the pull anchor 94, the pull direction being toward the top as shown in the drawing.<br>
Upon excitation of the excitation winding 92, the pull anchor 94 is pulled upwardly against the force of the spring 96 - that is. in the feed direction 45 - and,  as well, the drive part 44 together with the separation part 34 are pulled upwardly such that the dose liquid is discharged out of the outlet 20out of the partial chamber 18 and, at the same time, dose liquid is drawn in by suction through the inlet 4 into the partial chamber 2 and, thus, the feed of the dose liquid is effected as has been described in connection with Figures 1-3.   After the de-excitation, of the excitation winding 92the spring 96 presssesm the drive part 44 with the separation part 34 in the downward direction as shown in the drawing in the direction toward the intel 4.<br><br>
