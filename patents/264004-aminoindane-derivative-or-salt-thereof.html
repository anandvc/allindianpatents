AMINOINDANE DERIVATIVE OR SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an aminoindane<br>
derivative or a salt thereof which is useful as a medicine,<br>
especially as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and to an NMDA<br>
receptor antagonist comprising the same as an active<br>
ingredient. The aminoindane derivative or a salt thereof<br>
and the NMDA receptor antagonist comprising the same as an<br>
active ingredient, of the present invention, are useful for<br>
treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular <br>
dementia, Parkinson's disease, ischemic apoplexy, pain, and<br>
the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Glutamic acid acts as a neurotransmitter in the<br>
central nervous system of mammals, and controls the<br>
activity of neurocytes or the release of neurotransmitters<br>
via a glutamate receptor existing in synapses. At present,<br>
a glutamate receptor is classified into an "ionotropic<br>
glutamate receptor" and a "metabotropic glutamate receptor"<br>
from many pharmacological and biological studies (Hollmann<br>
M. and Heinemann S., Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 17 (1994) 31-<br><br>
108) . An NMDA (N-methyl~D-aspartate) receptor is an ion-<br>
channel glutamate receptor specifically sensitive to the<br>
agonist NMDA (Moriyoshi K. et al., Nature, 354 (1991) 31-<br>
37; Meguro H. et al., Nature, 357 (1992) 70-74); and this<br>
has high Ca 2+permeability (Iino M. et al., J. Physiol.,<br>
424 (1990) 151-165). The NMDA receptor is expressed with a<br>
specific pattern in a central nervous system (Ozawa S. et<br>
al., Prog. Neurobiol., 54 (1998) 581-618).<br>
[0003]<br>
From many pharmacological and biological studies, it<br>
is believed that an NMDA receptor may participate in high-<br>
order neurologic functions such as memory and learning<br>
(Morris RG., et al., Nature, 319 (1986) 774-776; Tsien JZ.<br>
et al., Cell, 87 (1996) 1327-1338). On the other hand, it<br>
is suggested that the acute or chronic NMDA receptor<br>
hyperactivity or hypoactivity may participate in various<br>
nervous system diseases, for example, ischemic apoplexy,<br>
hemorrhagic brain injury, traumatic brain injury,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease,<br>
cerebrovascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's<br>
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), glaucoma, AIDS<br>
encephalopathy, dependence, schizophrenia, depression,<br>
mania, stress-related diseases, epilepsy, and pain (Beal<br>
MF., FASEB J., 6 (1992) 3338-3344; Heresco-Levy U. and<br>
Javitt DC, Euro. Neuropsychopharmacol., 8 (1998) 141-152;<br>
Hewitt DJ., Clin. J. Pain, 16 (2000) S73-79). Accordingly,<br><br>
drugs capable of controlling the activity of an NMDA<br>
receptor woµld be extremely useful in clinical application.<br>
[0004]<br>
As drugs capable of controlling the activity of an<br>
NMDA receptor, a large number of non-competitive NMDA<br>
receptor antagonists are reported, but many of them have<br>
not been used in clinical application because of their side<br>
effects based on the NMDA receptor-antagonizing effect<br>
thereof, for example, mental aberration such as<br>
hallucination or confusion, and giddiness. Some of<br>
already-existing NMDA receptor antagonists, for example,<br>
ketamine and dextromethorphan have been tried against pain<br>
in clinical application (Fisher K. et al., J. Pain Symptom<br>
Manage., 20 (2000) 358-373), but the safety margin in the<br>
treatment with them is narrow, and their clinical use is<br>
limitative (Eide PK., et al., Pain, 58 (1994) 347-354).<br>
Memantine is known as a non-competitive NMDA receptor<br>
antagonist that has comparatively few side effects (Parsons<br>
CG., et al., Neuropharmacol., 38 (1999) 735-767); and<br>
recently, it has been reported that this may be effective<br>
for Alzheimer's disease (Reisberg B., et al., N. Engl. J.<br>
Med., 348 (2003) 1333-1341). However, the safety margin of<br>
memantine as a medicine is still not satisfactory, and an<br>
NMDA receptor antagonist having a broader safety margin is<br>
desired (Ditzler K., Arzneimittelforschung, 41 (1991) 773-<br>
780; Maier C, et al., Pain, 103 (2003) 277-283; Riederer<br><br>
P., et al., Lancet, 338 (1991) 1022-1023). It is expected<br>
that creation of such an NMDA receptor antagonist having a<br>
broader safety margin may bring about new clinical<br>
usefulness of the NMDA receptor antagonist.<br>

the starting compound and the reaction condition, generally<br><br>
covering from cooling to under reflux, preferably from<br>
about 0°C to about 100°C.<br>
In addition, the deprotection may also be attained in<br>

Thus prepared, the compounds (I) of the present<br>
invention may be isolated as free compounds or as their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. A salt of the compounds<br>
(I) of the present invention may be prepared by processing<br>
the compounds (I) of the present invention that are in the<br>
form of free bases for ordinary reactions for salt<br>
formation.<br>
[0026]<br>
The compound (I) of the present invention or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be isolated<br><br>
and purified as their hydrates, solvates, or crystalline<br>
polymorphic substances. The isolation and purification may<br>
be attained through ordinary chemical treatment of<br>
extraction, concentration, evaporation, crystallization,<br>
filtration, recrystallization, and various types of<br>
chromatography.<br>
Various isomers may be isolated by selecting suitable<br>
starting compounds, or by separating them based on the<br>
difference between the isomers in the physical or chemical<br>
properties thereof. For example, optical isomers may be<br>
led into stereochemically pure isomers by selecting<br>
suitable starting compounds or by racemic resolution of<br>
racemic compounds (for example, leading them into<br>
diastereomer salts with ordinary optically active acid for<br>
optical resolution).<br>

[0027]<br>
The NMDA receptor antagonistic activity of the<br>
compounds of the present invention was confirmed by the<br>
following test methods.<br>
1. MK-801 binding test:<br>
1) Preparation of Specimens of Rat Meninges:<br>
The whole brain was taken out from 30 10-week SD rats<br>
(Nippon SLC), and the cerebellum was removed from them. A<br>
0.32 M sucrose solution was added to the part containing<br>
the cerebrum, cut in a mixer, and homogenized with a<br>
Teflon™ (trademark) homogenizer. This was centrifuged at<br>
2800 rpm and 4°C for 15 minutes, and the resulting<br>
supernatant was again centrifuged at 15000 g and 4°C for 20<br>
minutes. The pellets were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH<br>
7.5) containing 0.08% Triton X-100, and kept statically on<br>
ice for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 15000 g and 4°C for<br>
20 minutes. The pellets were suspended, in 50 mM Tris-HCl<br>
(pH 7.5) added thereto, and centrifuged at 15000 g and 4°C<br>
for 20 minutes. 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was again added to<br>
the pellets, and centrifuged in the same manner as before.<br><br>
The pellets were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH<br>
7.5) added thereto, and homogenized with the Teflon™<br>
(trademark) homogenizer. The membrane specimen was divided<br>
into small tubes and stored in a deep freezer (-80°C).<br>
Before use, this was washed twice with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH<br>
7.5) of five times that of the membrane specimen. Its<br>
concentration was controlled at 1 mg protein/ml with 5 mM<br>
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) added to it, and this was used for assay.<br>
[0028]<br>
2) [3H] MK-801 binding Assay:<br>
50 µl of the rat membrane specimen (1 mg protein/ ml)<br>
was added to a solution of a test compound dissolved in 1<br>
µl of DMSO. Then, 50 µl of a ligand solution (600 nM<br>
glutamate, 600 nM glycine, 8 nM [3 H] MK-801 (Perkin-Elmer)<br>
was added to it and well stirred, and reacted at room<br>
temperature for 45 minutes. Using Uni Filter Plate GF/B 96<br>
(Perkin-Elmer) previously coated with 0.2%<br>
polyethyleneimine, the membrane specimen was collected, and<br>
the filter was well washed with 5 mM Tris-HCl(pH 7.5). 30<br>
µl of Microscinti 20 (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the<br>
filter, and the radioactivity trapped by the filter was<br>
determined by a microplate scintillation counter<br>
(TopCount™' by Beckman). Based on the MK-801 (final 1 µM)<br>
inhibition, 100%, of a control case of DMSO alone, the<br>
concentration of the compound for 50% inhibition, IC50 was<br>
computed. The [3 H]MK-801 binding affinity for the rat<br><br>
membrane specimen was obtained to be Kd = 1.6 nM through<br>
Scatchard analysis. The Ki value of the compound was<br>
computed according to the calcµlation equation: Ki =<br>
IC50/(1 + radioligand concentration (4 nM) in assay)/Kd<br>
value (1.6 nM)).<br>
As a result, the compounds of the present invention<br>
exhibited good NMDA receptor affinity. The Ki values of<br>
the NMDA receptor affinity of some typical compounds of the<br>
present invention are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
[0029]<br>
2. Intracellµlar Calcium Concentration Determination Test<br>
by FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader):<br>
1) Preparation of Rat First-Generation Neurocytes:<br>
Anesthetized with ether, Wistar rats (Nippon SLC) of<br>
pregnancy 19 days were let die from loss of blood by breast<br>
incision. The abdomen was cut open, and the womb was taken<br><br>
out, and the fetus was taken out of it. The whole brain<br>
was taken out, then the hemicerebrum was isolated in<br>
Neurobasal medium (Glu, Asp-free) (Gibco), and the meninx<br>
was removed. The hemicerebrum was recovered by<br>
centrifugation, and suspended in a cell-dispersing solution<br>
(0.36 mg/ml papain, 150 U/ml DNase 1, 0.02% L-cysteine<br>
monohydrochloride monohydrate, 0.02% bovine serum albumin,<br>
0.5% glucose, Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS), and processed at 37°C<br>
for 15 minutes. This was centrifuged at 400 g for 5<br>
minutes, and the supernatant was removed by suction. This<br>
was suspended in a neurocyte culture medium (Sumitomo<br>
Bakelite), and the cell masses were removed by filtration.<br>
The number of the living cells was counted, and 100,000<br>
cells/well were incubated on a 96-well plate (Biocoat<br>
PDL96W black/clear, by Nippon Becton Dickinson) (at 37°C in<br>
5% C02) .<br>
[0030]<br>
2) Intracellµlar Calcium Concentration Determination by<br>
FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader):<br>
The culture of rat first-generation neurocytes (DIV7-<br>
9) was removed by suction, and the cells were washed once<br>
with a 100 µl assay buffer (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution<br>
(Ca2+, Mg 2+-free) , 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl2) .<br>
100 µl of the assay buffer containing Fluo3 (Dojin<br>
Chemical) was added thereto, and incubated for 1 hour<br>
(37°C, 5% CO 2) The cells were washed three times with 100<br><br>
µl of the assay buffer, and then a test compound solution<br>
dissolved in 1 µl of DMSO, and 100 µl of the assay buffer<br>
containing 2.5 µM (final concentration) tetrodotoxin were<br>
added to it and incubated for 30 minutes (37°C, 5% CO 2)•<br>
The fluorescent intensity was measured at intervals of 2<br>
seconds. Ten seconds after the measurement start, 50 µl of<br>
a ligand solution (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Ca 2+' Mg<br>
2+-free) , 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl2, 9 µM NMDA,<br>
30 µM lycine) containing the test compound solution<br>
dissolved in 0.5 µl of DMSO was added to it, and the<br>
fluorescent intensity of the system was measured for 120<br>
seconds from the start of the measurement. The data<br>
measured for 120 seconds (60 times in total) were averaged.<br>
Based on the 10 µM MK-801 inhibition with a control case of<br>
DMSO alone of 100%, the concentration of the compound for<br>
50% inhibition, IC50, was computed.<br>
As a result, the compounds of the present invention<br>
exhibited a good NMDA receptor antagonizing effect.<br>
[0031]<br>
