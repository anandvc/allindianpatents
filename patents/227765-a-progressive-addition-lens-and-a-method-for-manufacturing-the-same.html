				<td>PROGRESSIVE ADDITION LENSES WITH PRISM POWER ADDED TO<br>
IMPROVE WEARER COMFORT<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention is directed to progressive addition lenses in which prism power is added<br>
resulting in improved image quality.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known. For<br>
example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ("PALs"), are used for<br>
the treatment of presbyopia. Typically, a PAL provides distance, intermediate, and<br>
near vision zones in a gradual, continuous progression of increasing dioptric power.<br>
PALs are appealing to the wearer because the lenses are free of the visible ledges<br>
between the zones of differing optical power that are found in other types of multifocal<br>
lenses, such as bifocals and trifocals.<br>
However, inherent in PALs are changes in image location, magnification, and<br>
blur upon movement of the wearer's head and eyes. These problems with image<br>
quality and movement make it difficult for the PAL wearer to adapt to and use the<br>
lenses. Known methods to reduce these image problems include spreading the<br>
unwanted astigmatism, or astigmatism introduced by the lens, into the periphery of the<br>
lens, lengthening of the channel to provide a more gradual increase in power, and<br>
using more than one progressive surface to form the lens. These methods are<br>
disadvantageous in that they do not offset the effect on image quality of unprescribed<br>
prism power, or prism power introduced or caused by one or more of the lens surfaces,<br>
resulting in image blurring, distorting, and shifting for the lens wearer. Thus, a need<br>
exists for a PAL that overcomes this disadvantage.<br>

Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides lenses, as well as methods for their design and<br>
production, in which prism power is introduced into the lens. This added prism power<br>
overcomes, in whole or in part, the adverse image quality effect of the lens'<br>
unprescribed prism power.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a progressive addition lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of an add power, a near vision<br>
zone vertical prism having a power and a base, and a vertical prism having a power and<br>
a base added to substantially the whole lens, wherein the added vertical prism base is<br>
opposite in direction to the near vision zone vertical prism base and the added vertical<br>
prism power is equal to about 0.25 percent of the add power.<br>
By "progressive addition lens " is meant a lens having at least one progressive<br>
addition surface. A "progressive addition surface" is a continuous, aspheric surface<br>
having distance and near viewing or vision zones, and a zone of increasing dioptric<br>
power connecting the distance and near zones. By "add power"<br><br>
is meant the amount of dioptric power difference between the near and distance vision<br>
zones of the progressive addition lens.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a pair of progressive addition<br>
lens, comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of: a.) a first lens comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of a first add power, a first near vision zone<br>
vertical prism having a power and a base, and a first vertical prism having a power and<br>
a base added to substantially the whole lens; b.) a second lens comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of a second add power, a second near vision zone vertical<br>
prism having a power and a base, and a second vertical prism having a power and a<br>
base added to substantially the whole lens; wherein the first and second added prism<br>
base each are opposite in direction to the near vision zone vertical prism base to which<br>
it is added, the added vertical prisms each is equal to about 0.25 percent of the add<br>
power of the lens to which it is added, and there is a difference between the vertical<br>
prism at any point on the first lens and a corresponding point on the second lens equal<br>
to or less than about 0.5 diopters.<br>
It is a discovery of the invention that a the continuous change in power of the<br>
progressive addition lens from the distance to the near vision zone introduces vertical<br>
prism into the lens, the introduced prism varying in power corresponding to the power<br>
change from the lens' fitting point to the near vision zone. The power and direction of<br>
this vertical prism is dependent on the distance and near vision zone<br>
spherical powers of the lens.<br>
Typically, the prism will be either base up or base down. By "base up" is meant<br>
that the base of the prism lies in the direction of 90 degrees relative to the lens surface.<br>
By "base down" is meant that the base of the prism lies in the direction of 270 degrees<br>
relative to the lens surface. For positive spherical powers in the near<br>
vision zone, the vertical prism will be a base up prism and for a negative spherical<br>
power, the prism will be a base down prism. The effect of the base up prism is to curve<br><br>
and elongate the image being viewed by the lens wearer. Base down prism results in a<br>
curving of the image and a shifting upwardly of the image. Thus, the unprescribed<br>
prism inherent in a progressive addition lens near vision zone results in a reduced<br>
image quality for the lens wearer.<br>
It is another discovery of the image that the image quality of a progressive<br>
addition lens may be improved by addition of vertical prism to substantially the entire<br>
lens. The added prism is of a base direction that is opposite to that of the unprescribed<br>
vertical prism inherent in the near vision zone of the lens. Because vertical prism is<br>
added to substantially the entire lens, the added prism power must be limited to that<br>
amount that the lens wearer can tolerate without a substantial reduction of visual acuity<br>
in the distance viewing zone. Typically, more than one line loss of visual acuity, as<br>
measured using a visual acuity chart, is not well tolerated by the lens wearer.<br>
Therefore, preferably the amount of added vertical prism power is equal to about 0.25<br>
percent of the lens' add power. More preferably, in a pair of lenses to be worn, the<br>
amount of added prism power is about equal in both lenses worn by the lens wearer.<br>
Most preferably, the amount of prism added to a pair of lenses is such that the vertical<br>
prism at any point on the right eye lens is different from that of corresponding point on<br>
the left eye lens by an amount equal to or less than about 0.5 diopters..<br>
The lenses of the invention may be fabricated by any convenient means and<br>
constructed of any known material suitable for production of ophthalmic lenses.<br>
Suitable materials include, without limitation, polycarbonate, allyl diglycol,<br>
polymethacrylate, and the like. Such materials are either commercially available or<br>
methods for their production are known. Further, the lenses may be produced by<br>
any conventional lens fabrication technique including, without limitation grinding,<br>
whole lens casting, molding, thermoforming, laminating, surface casting, or<br>
combinations thereof. Casting may be carried out by any means, but preferably is<br>
performed by surface casting including, without limitation, as disclosed in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 5,147,585, 5,178,800, 5,219,497, 5,316,702, 5,358,672,<br><br>
5,480,600, 5,512,371, 5,531,940, 5,702,819, and 5,793,465 incorporated herein in<br>
their entireties by reference.<br>
Addition of vertical prism power into a lens may be accomplished using a<br>
variety of methods. The particular method used will depend upon the method desired<br>
to be used in manufacturing the lens. For example, for lenses in which surfacing is<br>
used to produce one or more of the lens surfaces, the added vertical prism power may<br>
be incorporated into the lens through the surfacing process, for instance and without<br>
limitation by using offset blocking techniques. As an alternative method, in lenses in<br>
which one or more of the surfaces, or the entire lens is cast, the molds used to cast the<br>
lens or surface may be tilted so as to add the vertical prism power. The power of the<br>
vertical prism added into the lens by such tilting will be approximately equal to the tilt<br>
of the mold surface to the preform surface. For example, one degree of tilt will equal<br>
about 1 diopter of added prism power. The direction of the tilt will determine whether<br>
the prism is base up or base down.<br>
In Fig.1 is shown progressive addition lens 10 of the prior art having the lens<br>
add power on the convex surface. The solid lines 11 and 12 indicate the ray traces for<br>
the distance and near vision lines of sight, respectively, and show how the objects<br>
viewed through the lens appear shifted due to the unprescribed vertical prism in the<br>
near vision zone arising from the higher surface curvature. As a reference, the dotted<br>
line 13 indicates the shape of a lens with zero add power (single vision lens) and the<br>
dotted line 14 shows the difference in the ray trace between the progressive<br>
and single vision lens. Fig. 2 shows a lens 20 that is a progressive addition lens with<br>
the add power on the convex surface. Dotted line 23 depicts the shape of the lens<br>
absent any added prism. Solid lines 21 and 22 depict lens 20 with the convex surface<br>
of the lens tilted to produce base down prism. The resultant shape of the lens and the<br>
ray traces 25 and 26 show how the objects viewed through the lens appear largely<br>
unshifted due to the lower unprescribed prism in the near vision zone.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, an optical preform is used and onto at least one<br>
preform's surfaces is cast one or more layers. By "optical preform" is meant a shaped,<br>
optically transparent article capable of refracting light and possessing a<br>
convex and a concave surface, which article is suitable for use in producing a spectacle<br>
lens. Each of the optical preform and cast layer refractive powers may be a portion or<br>
all of the distance vision, near vision, intermediate vision, or cylinder refractive power,<br>
of the finished lens to be formed, or combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, at least one surface of the optical preform is a progressive addition surface<br>
and the cast layer forms an additional progressive surface, most preferably formed on<br>
the preform's front surface.<br>
Positioning of a mold and a preform so as to add the desired vertical prism<br>
power may be accomplished by use of any convenient positioning means such as a<br>
gimbal holder, a gripper, a vacuum gripper, or the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, positioning is accomplished by placing the mold, using positioning means<br>
such as suction, in a fixture capable of gimbaling action. The required mold<br>
displacement and tilt may be accomplished by any conventional displacement means,<br>
including, without limitation, servo motors.<br>
Once the desired mold-preform orientation is achieved material for forming the<br>
cast layer is dispensed into the mold and cured to form the cast layer,. Suitable<br>
materials for use in the process include, without limitation, those disclosed in United<br>
States Patent No. 5,470,892, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Additional<br>
suitable monomers include, without limitation, allyl and bis(allyl) carbonates, such as<br>
diethylene glycol bis(allyl) carbonate, bisphenol A diallyl carbonate, and the like,<br>
acrylic acid, multi-functional acrylates and methacrylates, such as ethylene glycol<br>
diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate,<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl<br>
acrylate, hexanediolmethacrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, propyl<br>
methacrylate, penterythritol tetraacrylate, urethane acrylates and methacrylates, styrene<br><br>
and styrene derivatives such as divinyl benzene, 4-vinyl anisole, various esters or<br>
maleic and itaconic acids, methacrylic and acrylic<br>
anhydrides and the like, and combinations thereof. Such monomers are commercially<br>
available or methods for their production are known. Materials<br>
suitable for use for the preform are those above-listed for use as spectacle lens material.<br>
Curing of the dispensed material may take place by any conventional means<br>
including, without limitation, thermal cure, radiation cure, visible light cure, and<br>
combinations thereof. Preferably, ultra-violet cure is used, more preferably a two-<br>
stage UV cure in which the mold is exposed to low intensity and then high intensity<br>
ultraviolet light.<br>
In another embodiment, the prism is introduced at the interface of two layers of<br>
a lens, each layer preferably being of a different refractive index. The amount of the<br>
prism may be one of constant over the entire lens area, have a constant value above<br>
the x-axis, have a different constant value below the x-axis, have a blended<br>
discontinuity across the x-axis, gradually change in a smooth, monotonic manner from<br>
the fitting point to the near vision zone of the lens, or combinations thereof. In<br>
embodiments in which the magnitude, or amount, of the added prism changes from the<br>
fitting point to the near vision zone, the change must be gradual so as to avoid<br>
introduction of unwanted astigmatism into the progressive addition channel. The<br>
magnitude of the added prism must take into account the refractive index difference<br>
between the two layers according to standard optical principles. Placing the prism at an<br>
internal interface is advantageous in that it permits independent control of the amount<br>
of prism in the distance and near viewing zones and simplifies the lens' manufacture.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by a consideration of the following, non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Example 1<br>
In Fig. 3 is shown a progressive addition lens 30 having a portion of the total<br>
lens add power on the convex surface 35 and another portion on the concave surface<br>
36. The lens of this example was formed by casting a progressive addition surface onto<br>
the convex surface of an optical preform. A lens having a total add power of 2.25<br>
diopters was produced with the concave surface having an add power of 0.75 diopters<br>
and the convex surface an add power of 1.50 diopters. A lens with a total add power of<br>
1.50 diopters was produced with the concave surface having an add power of 0.75<br>
diopters and the convex surface an add power of 0.75 diopters. The solid lines 31 and<br>
32 are the ray traces of the distance and near line of sight, respectively. Dotted line 33<br>
depicts the shape of the lens in the case that the lens is a single vision lens and dotted<br>
line 34 shift in the ray trace for the single vision lens. Table 1 shows the horizontal and<br>
vertical prism powers of lenses such as lens 30 without added prism. For the 2.25<br>
diopter add power lenses the unprescribed vertical prism in the near zone ranges<br>
between 0.65 and 1.12 base up prism diopters.<br>
For the 1.50 diopter add power lenses the unprescribed vertical prism in the near zone<br>
ranges between 0.49 and 0.59 base up prism diopters.<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 4 shows progressive addition lenses 40 produced with convex surface 45<br>
tilted to produce base down prism. These lenses were formed by casting a progressive<br>
addition surface onto an optical preform. Vertical prism was added to the lenses by<br>
tilting the glass mold used to cast the progressive addition surface B degrees in relation<br>
to the preform about the preform's x axis, given by the formula:<br>
B = {1/(n - 1)] x arctan(P/100)	(I)<br>
where n is the refractive index of the cast layer and P is the introduced prism.<br>
A suitable casting resin was then added and the cured to form the lenses shown. The<br>
amount of vertical prism added was equal to half of the add power. For the 2.25<br>
diopter add power lenses, approximately 1.12 diopters of base down prism were added.<br>
For the 1.50 diopter add power lenses, approximately 0.75 of base down prism was<br>
added. Solid lines 41 and 42 show the ray trace of the distance and near vision liens of<br>
sight, respectively, through the lens. Dotted line 44 depicts the ray trace absent<br>
addition of the prism.<br>
In Table 2 is shown the lenses of Table 1 into which vertical prism power was<br>
added. As can be seen by a comparison of the tables, the near vision zone vertical prism<br>
power is reduced by the added prism power.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
In Fig. 5 is depicted a lens 50 in which there is introduction of a uniform<br>
magnitude of base down prism at an interface of two surfaces 54 and 55 of the lens, one<br>
surface being made from a material of a refractive index of 1.60 and the other of 1.50.<br>
The convex surface 54 of the lens has a distance zone curvature of 6.00 diopters and<br>
near zone curvature of 7.00 diopters. The concave surface 55 distance zone has a<br>
curvature of 6.00 diopters and a near zone curvature of 5.00 diopters. The lens'<br>
distance power is 0.00 diopters and the add power is 2.00 diopters. The curvature of<br>
the interface 56 is 6.00 diopters and is tilted, relative to the convex surface by 6 degrees<br>
(D) to produce base down prism (P) over the whole lens of:<br><br>
Solid lines 51 and 52 show the ray traces for the distance and near lines of sight,<br>
respectively through the lens and dotted line 53 depicts the ray trace absent the added<br>
prism.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
In Fig. 6 is illustrated a lens 60 into which there is introduction of a gradually<br>
increasing magnitude of base down prism at the interface between two surfaces 64 and<br>
65 of the lens, the surface being made from materials of 1.60 and 1.50 refractive<br>
indices. The convex surface 64 of the lens has a distance zone curvature of 6.00<br>
diopters and a near zone curvature of 7.00 diopters. The concave surface 65 distance<br>
zone curvature is 6.00 diopters and it has a near zone curvature of 5.00 diopters. The<br>
lens' distance power is 0.00 diopters and the add power is 2.00 diopters. The curvature<br>
of the interface 66 in the distance zone from the fitting point and above (y &gt; 0 mm) is<br>
6.00 diopters and is parallel to the convex surface in the zone. This introduces no prism<br>
at the fitting point. The curvature below the top of the near zone (y 
diopters and tilted, relative to the convex surface, by 6 degrees introducing base down<br>
prism in the near zone of:<br><br>
The interface curvature between the fitting point and the top of the near zone (o &gt; y &gt; —<br>
15 mm) is smoothly blended to the curvature above and below these coordinates in<br>
such a manner as to minimize visual disturbances. Solid lines 61 and 62 show the ray<br>
traces for the distance and near lines of sight, respectively through the lens and dotted<br>
line 63 depicts the ray trace absent the added prism.<br><br>
