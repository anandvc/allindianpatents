PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
Page 1<br><br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to pressurized ball point pen ink compositions having viscosity about 10 K to 45K cps at 25° C preventing leakage due to formation of temporary bridging between functional groups and associative thickening.<br>
This invention also relates to pressurized ball point pen ink compositions having viscosity below 10000 cps preventing leakage due to formation of temporary bridging between functional groups and associative thickening.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of pressurized ball point pen ink compositions of the invention.<br>
This invention also relates to a ball point pen comprising the above-mentioned pressurized ball point pen ink compositions.<br>
Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument which features a tip that is automatically refreshed with ink. It consists of a precisely formed metal ball seated in a socket below a reservoir of ink. As the pen is moved along a writing surface, ink is delivered.<br>
A conventionally known oil-based ink for such a ballpoint pen contains coloring agent, organic solvent, resin or the like, and its ink viscosity is in a range of 10000 to 30000 mPa's at 20° C.<br>
The earlier pens leaked or clogged due to improper viscosity of the ink, and depended on gravity to ink delivery to the ball. Depending upon the gravity it caused difficulties with the flow and that it was required that the pen to be held nearly vertically.<br>
A conventional non-aqueous ball point pen has been designed by setting an ink viscosity in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 mPa's at 20° C to prevent leakage. The use of high viscosity ink increases the ball rotation resistance during writing and it affects writing smoothness and fails to be satisfactory. Further, a high writing pressure is required during writing. In some cases, a load of 500 gf or more is applied to a pen point. The heavy load causes a pen point to be damaged instantly. Furthermore, ball breakage and writing defects frequently occur as a consequence.<br>
One of the writing defects is Blobbing that is a phenomenon in which a surplus ink during writing is accumulated in a pen point. Another defect is "Feathering" which is blurring of the ink due to absorption by paper etc.<br>
There are various Japanese Patent Application laid-open nos. 6-313143 (1994), 6-313144 (1994), 7-196972 (1995) and 9-48941 (1997) that disclose ink consisting of pseudo plasticity viscosity<br>
Page 2<br><br>
property in which the ink viscosity during writing is low and ink viscosity is high when writing is not performed. However, leakage is not prevented completely.<br>
The following are the prior arts which discuss prevention of leakage by achieving high viscosity by using different additives:<br>
US 6503966 discloses the non-aqueous ball point pen ink consisting of the colorant; the organic solvent; the non-Newtonian viscosity imparting agent such as fatty acid amide wax with a melting temperature of 140° C or more; and a thickening agent such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone with a weigh-average molecular weight of about 40,000 to 55,000. The non-Newtonian viscosity index of the ink is not less than 0.1 and less than 0.4, a viscosity of the ink in a shearing speed of 500 sec"1 is not less than 1,000 and less than 3,000 mPa-s at 20° C, and the viscosity of the ink in the shearing speed of 0.19 sec"1 is not less than 40,000 mPa-s at 20° C and not more than 70,000 mPa-s at 20° C.<br>
US6479568 discloses the ink consisting of two types of polyvinyl pyrrolidone having different weight-average molecular weights to eliminate ink blobbing and scratching. The first polyvinyl pyrrolidone with a weight-average molecular weight of about 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 and the second polyvinyl pyrrolidone with a weight-average molecular weight of about 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 are used in the above mentioned ink.<br>
US7303350 discloses the ink composition for a pressurized ballpoint pen consisting of at least a colorant, a solvent and silica. The coagulated matter of the ink consisting of at least silica and the ink composition has a viscosity of 10000 to 40000 mPa.s at 25° C.<br>
US6441061 discloses the additive for an oil based ink for a ball point pen. The ink consists of at least one or plural kinds of organic solvents, a resin and an inorganic fine particle thickener. The additive has a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s or more at a shear rate of 5/s and at 0° C and a viscosity of 50000 mPa.s or less at a shear rate of 5/s and 50° C and has a non-Newtonian index of from 0.30 to 0.95. The additive has an absorbance of from 0.01 to 5 at a wavelength of 900 nm when a cell is 1 cm long. The specific surface area (BET method) of said inorganic fine particle thickener ranges from 30 to 500 m/g and an average diameter of the primary particles thereof ranges from 5 to 50 nm. The inorganic fine particle thickener comprises inorganic fine particles containing Si02 of 70% by weight or more.<br>
Ball point pens filled with conventional inks have a viscosity of 5000 to 20000 mPa's at 25°. Sometimes inks leak from the pen tips when the ball point pens have been irradiated directly with sunlight to have the temperatures of the pen bodies elevated, or when the ball point pens have been left turning downward for long time. Ball point pens filled with inks having a low viscosity of 1000 to 5000 mPa"s at 25° C shows such tendency more markedly. Increasing the<br>
Page 3<br><br>
drying property of inks in order to stop leaking of the inks brings about the problems of deterioration in the writing feeling, starving at the beginning of writing and reduction in the shelf life. Furthermore, inks leaking out of the pen tips of ball point pens stain hands and cloths or make it impossible to use the ball point pens in a certain case. Accordingly, it is the current situation to prevent inks from leaking by reducing clearance of tips, and thus the writing feeling tends to be deteriorated.<br>
US5942027 discloses the ink for a ball point pen which comprises at least one or plural kinds of organic solvents, colorants and resins and fine particle silica having a primary average particle diameter of 7 to 40 nm and a specific surface area (BET method) of 50 to 380 m@2 /g. The ink for a ball point pen comprises polyvinyl pyrrolidone as an additive. The ink for a ball point pen has a viscosity of 1000 to 5000 mPa"s at 25° C.<br>
US6530708 discloses the ink follower composition for oil-based ballpoint pens. The ink composition comprises at least one organic solvent selected from the group consisting of a sparingly volatile organic solvent and a non-volatile organic solvent, a gelling agent comprising inorganic fine particles, and from 10 to 60% by weight of a resin soluble in the organic solvent used. The resin is terpene-base resins and phenol-base resins. The inorganic fine particles are fine particulate silica. However, US 3425779 uses colloidal silica to prepare ink composition having viscosity of 874,000 cps at 28° C with a No 4 cylindrical spindle at 0.3 rpm on Brookfield viscometer.<br>
JP 2003191680 discloses a ballpoint pen with which handwriting is clear and write-ability is good without bleeding, strike through and clogging, in the ballpoint pen having a ballpoint pen tip rotate-ably supporting a writing point ball in a ball holding state and filled with an oily ink. The oily ink consists of coloring gent, organic solvent, non-Newtonian viscosity imparting agent and C4 aliphatic alcohol. The non-Newtonian viscosity index is 04.to 0.9 and viscosity at a shearing speed of 500 sec"1 is 500 to 5000 pas at 20° C.<br>

According to the invention, polyamine or polyol used as associative thickening agent / additives which forms temporary bridging between silica particles and simultaneously forms associative coupling between polyamines and/ or polyol to obtain network of the same. The formation of network gives the ink composition having viscosity of about 10 to 45 K as measured by Brookfield Viscometer spindle No 21 at 1 Rpm. When this value is extrapolated to zero sheer, the values may reach very high in static conditions of storage. The use of associative thickening agent / additives to bond / couple silica particles reduces the amount of silica particles required from about 3 % to less than 2% percent and also amount of PVP to less than 1 % to achieve / obtain ink having viscosity of about 10K to 45K cps at 25° C at 25° C with a No 21 cylindrical spindle at 1 rpm on Brookfield viscometer. Thus, making the process and ink composition cost-effective as amines or diols or polyols are less expensive than that of silica particles and PVP. The ink composition having viscosity below lOOOOcps by using higher alcohol and preventing leakage, hobbling, etc which are generally problems associated with prior art. The writing pleasure of the ink depends also upon the viscosity of the ink and is inversely proportional to the viscosity. Thus, the ink compositions have advantage of smooth writing and thereby give pleasure experience while writing. The higher alcohol is used in the invention as anti-leakage and plasticizing additives against the prior art where the same is generally used as a co-solvent or primary solvent for manufacturing inks. Further the ink having less viscosity; particularly less than 10,000 cps has difficulty stopping the leakage and long term stability for withstanding the<br>
