				<td>ULTRASOUND THERAPEUTIC EQUIPMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of ultrasound treatment. More particularly, the present invention relates to an ultrasound therapeutic equipment useful for treating skin lesions of gynecology and other human being's skin lesions with focused ultrasound.<br>
BACKGROUD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ultrasound therapy as a surgical way for the diseased tissue has been developed in recent years. In principle, the focused ultrasound is used to destroy and necrotize the diseased tissue, and then the tissue necrosed is gradually absorbed by normal tissue, or the focused ultrasound exposure is deployed to bring benign changes to the diseased tissue. Prior to the present invention, the techniques to bring the high-intensity focused ultrasound have been well developed. However, the problem encountered by the medical circle and medical equipment industry is how to effectively practice the therapeutic ultrasound in clinic for treatment of various diseases on different part of patient.<br>
The existing ultrasound therapeutic apparatus are mostly designed for tumor treatment of human being. Generally, the tumors are concentrated and located within tissue far from the ultrasound applicator, which supplies the therapeutic ultrasound, and they are easily to be positioned and exposed by focused ultrasound from the ultrasound applicator. For this kind of ultrasound therapeutic devices treating tumors, the ultrasound applicator is required to be relatively fixed on a motion device, so that the ultrasound applicator can be driven by the mechanics aiming at the tumor. Furthermore, a high-intensity ultrasound exposure and an ultrasound applicator of a big size are required to destroy the tumor.<br>
The feature of the skin lesions including the skin lesions of gynecology is different from that of tumors. The skin lesions are distributed on skin surface or under subcutaneous tissue, close to ultrasound applicator. Also, the skin lesions are small and sensitive to ultrasound exposure. Therefore, it is unpractical to use a big and heavy ultrasound applicator of the prior techniques to locate and treat the skin lesions. It is unsuitable to use the ultrasound applicator, which is relatively fixed on a motion device to treat the skin lesions, which are, in most cases, distributed in a wide area. Additionally, a small intensity of ultrasound is applied to destroying the skin lesions and the ultrasound energy is required to be attenuated rapidly after the ultrasound beam going through the epidermal tissue and lower subcutaneous tissue in order to avoid destroying the deeper tissue within body. Therefore, an ultrasound therapeutic apparatus with a high frequency dedicated for treating skin lesions is needed in clinic.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, in one aspect, an object of the invention is to provide an equipment for treating skin lesions of a human being including the skin lesions of gynecology with a focused ultrasound.<br>
Further, an object of the invention is to provide an equipment which is more convenient for clinicians to use in clinic to treat skin lesions of a human being including the skin lesions of gynecology with a focused ultrasound.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an equipment with an ultrasound applicator which can be held by hand and is more convenient for clinicians to use in clinic to treat skin lesions of human being including the skin lesions of gynecology with a focused ultrasound.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an equipment with a light and portable ultrasound applicator which is more convenient for clinicians to use in clinic to treat skin lesions of human being including the skin lesions of gynecology with a focused ultrasound.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an equipment with an ultrasound applicator with a small front distal which is more convenient for clinicians to use in clinic to treat skin lesions of human being including the skin lesions of gynecology with a focused ultrasound.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an ultrasound therapeutic equipment with a frequency width suitable for effectively treating skin lesions of a human being.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an ultrasound therapeutic equipment with an acoustic power intensity suitable for effectively treating skin lesions of a human being.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an ultrasound therapeutic equipment with a cooling means during treating skin lesions of a human being.<br>
The invention provides an ultrasound therapeutic equipment for treating skin lesions of a human being. The apparatus includes a controlling device, an ultrasound transducer transmitting the therapeutic ultrasound beam to a target region of the human being, and a focusing means. Said controlling device is a control system used to control the operation of the ultrasound therapeutic equipment. Said ultrasound transducer and said focusing means are installed in an ultrasound applicator which can be held by hand.<br>
Said ultrasound applicator, which can be held by hand, includes a handle and a shell<br>
forming a lumen wherein said ultrasound transducer and said focusing means are placed.<br>
Said controlling device has a frequency width ranging from 5MHz to 25MHz, and preferably, from 9 MHz to 11MHz.<br>
The ultrasound applicator is capable of producing a focused ultrasound wave. The focal length of the ultrasound applicator ranges from 5mm to 50mm, and preferably, ranges from 9mm to 11mm. The acoustic output of the ultrasound applicator is more than 3W.<br>
Said ultrasound therapeutic equipment of the present invention further includes a cooling means. Said cooling means includes a water tank connecting to a water piping system comprising of an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe, which is going through the ultrasound applicator suitable for being held by a hand. The water may flow into the lumen through the inlet water pipe and flow out of the lumen of the ultrasound applicator through the outlet water pipe so that the water tank, the inlet water pipe and outlet water pipe form a loop.<br>
The diameter of the front distal of said ultrasound applicator ranges from 5mm to 80mm, and preferably, ranges from 14mm to 16mm.<br>
Said ultrasound transducer is detachable and installed within the handheld ultrasound applicator.<br>
Preferably, the water contained in the said cooling means is distilled water.<br>
When the ultrasound therapeutic equipment of the present invention is used in clinic for treating skin lesions, the diseased part is exposed by the focused ultrasound beam with said appropriate parameters as specified in present patent document. The tissue cells in the diseased part will be oscillated and heated under the ultrasound exposure. When the ultrasound energy is high enough, the heat produced by focused ultrasound wave will deposit in the targeted tissue fast and the temperature of the targeted tissue will rise rapidly, e.g. in several seconds. The tissue edema by ultrasound radiation will be caused and the microcirculation in tissue is improved. The area for tissue edema can be controlled through appropriately controlling the parameters adopted by the ultrasound therapeutic equipment.<br>
Animal experiments have been performed to verify the therapeutic effect of the therapy by using the ultrasound therapeutic equipment of the present invention. 160 New Zealand rabbits and 5 mini-swines were used in the animal experiments. The parameters specified in this patent application document were adopted in the experiments. After these animal experiments, the changes on the treated diseased part were observed and evaluated. The results of these experiments showed that the<br>
ultrasound wave could go through the skin surface and effect the subcutaneous tissue without causing damage to epidermis, the edema in subcutaneous tissue disappeared soon upon ultrasound exposure and the subcutaneous tissue recovered.<br>
The vulvar dystrophy is a kind of chronic disease, characterizing in degeneration of pigments in skin, whitening of mucosa on vulvae, disorder growth of epidermis tissue and denaturalization of a hypodermis tissue. The vulvar dystrophy is a common gynecology disease of which the pathogeny is not quite clear. It is also a clinically refractory disease for which no specifically effective medicine has been identified. The equipment of the present invention was used to treat at least tens of persons suffering from vulvar dystrophy. During the treatment process, the patients had no bad reaction and didn't feel any discomfort. After the treatment, the edema in the treated region appeared and then disappeared within 3 days. Then the symptoms of vulvar dystrophy were relieved greatly, the pruritus faded away and the diseased part recovered normally. These treatment results showed that it is advantageous to use said ultrasound therapeutic equipment of the present invention to treat skin lesions instead of using other methods.<br>
These and other advantages of the invention, along with the invention itself, will be more understood after a review of the description, figures for the description, and the appended claims.<br>
