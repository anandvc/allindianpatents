				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a synchronization technology in a mobile communication<br>
system, and more particularly to an encoding method and apparatus for a frame synchronization<br>
signal.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the mobile communication system, user equipment (UE) needs to execute an initial access<br>
procedure before exchanging information with a base station, so as to realize timing synchronization<br>
and finish searching for a cell (acquiring a cell ID) or searching for a cell group (acquiring a cell<br>
group ID). The timing synchronization includes symbol synchronization and frame<br>
synchronization. Generally, the UE realizes symbol synchronization by detecting a primary-<br>
synchronization (P-SCH) signal sent by the base station, and realizes frame synchronization by<br>
detecting a secondary-synchronization (S-SCH) signal sent by the base station. The S-SCH signal<br>
carries information of a cell ID or a cell group ID, so as to enable the UE to finish searching for a<br>
cell or a cell group while realizing the frame synchronization.<br>
In the 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) standard, each<br>
radio frame (10 ms) has two S-SCH signals which are respectively located in orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols of the 0th sub-frame and the 5th sub-frame, and the<br>
transmission interval between them is 5 ms. Each of the S-SCH signals includes two secondary<br>
synchronization code (SSC) sequences, and each SSC sequence is selected from a sequence set<br>
formed by M sequences with a length of 31 respectively. The sequence set is referred to as an SSC<br>
sequence set, and each SSC sequence is an element of the SSC sequence set. Thus, the two SSC<br>
sequences included in each S-SCH signal of each radio frame are generally represented as (Sa, Sb),<br>
in which a and b respectively represent the indices of the two SSC sequences in the above sequence<br>
set.<br>
The values of index a and b are referred to as short codes, so that the S-SCH including Sa<br><br>
and Sb may be identified as a codeword [a, b] formed by the indices a and b, which is called an<br>
S-SCH codeword. S-SCH codewords formed by different values of a and b represent different<br>
S-SCH signals, and each of the two S-SCH signals correspond to one of 170 cell IDs or cell group<br>
IDs. In this manner, 340 different S-SCH signals are required, and correspondingly, 340 S-SCH<br>
codewords exist.<br>
In order to detect an S-SCH signal, the UE correlates the received S-SCH signal with all the<br>
SSC sequences in the SSC sequence set, and identifies two SSC sequences corresponding to the<br>
relevant peak values (i.e. short codes in the S-SCH codeword).<br>
In order to further reduce the synchronization time of the UE, two S-SCH signals in the<br>
same frame are set to include two same SSC sequences, but the two SSC sequences have different<br>
arranging order in each S-SCH signal. That is to say, the two SSC sequences included in the<br>
S-SCH signal of the sub-frame 0 are sequentially (Sa, Sb), and the two SSC sequences included in<br>
the S-SCH signal of the sub-frame 5 are sequentially (Sb, Sa). Thus, the UE can realize the frame<br>
synchronization and acquire the cell group ID only through detecting the S-SCH signal in one<br>
sub-frame.<br>
Based on the above method, 170 S-SCH codewords need to be set as each corresponding to<br>
each cell ID or cell group ID. It is assumed that, among the 170 S-SCH codewords, the S-SCH<br>
codeword (corresponding to the S-SCH signal in the sub-frame 0) corresponding to the cell IDi of<br>
the ith cell is represented as i=0~ 169, in which Sio indicates a first short code (i.e. the<br>
short code a), Sil indicates a second short code (i.e. the short code b); and then the first short code<br>
and the second short code are reversed, so as to obtain the other 170 S-SCH codewords<br>
(corresponding to the S-SCH signals in the sub-frame 5) i=0~l69, which have a<br>
reversed short code sequence.<br>
At the boundaries of a plurality of cells, the UE may detect SSC sequences from many<br>
different cells, and the detected SSC sequences from each cell have similar correlation value, so that<br>
the S-SCH signals detected by the UE may be formed by SSC sequences respectively from two<br><br>
different cells. For example, if the S-SCH codeword ci of the cell i is and the S-SCH<br>
codeword cj of the cell j is the UE may incorrectly detect the S-SCH signals such as<br>
  including the SSC sequences respectively from two different cells at the<br>
boundary of the two cells. Apparently, such S-SCH signals are invalid, and the UE cannot obtain the<br>
frame synchronization or acquire the cell group ID. Thus, in order to reduce the occurrence of the<br>
above circumstance and enhance the reliability of the frame synchronization, all the set S-SCH<br>
codewords need to fulfill that is, the magnitude relation between the first<br>
short code and the second short code in each S-SCH codeword needs to be the same, and the<br>
maximum short code distance  between two short codes needs to be as small as possible.<br>
If all the S-SCH codewords satisfy  the UE may realize the frame<br>
synchronization even if the UE does not acquire the cell group ID.<br>
An encoding method for an S-SCH codeword is proposed in the related art, which may be<br>
used to obtain all the S-SCH codewords and a cell ID or a cell group ID corresponding to each<br>
S-SCH codeword.<br>
Particularly, the encoding method may be represented as:<br><br>
The variable ID indicates a cell ID or cell group ID,   indicates a first short code<br>
corresponding to the cell ID or cell group ID, indicates a second short code corresponding<br>
to the cell ID or cell group ID, 31 indicates the number of elements in the SSC sequence set, and<br>
  indicates the maximum integer smaller than the value of a quotient of dividing the cell ID or<br>
cell group ID by the SSC sequence length.<br><br>
During the process of realizing the above encoding solution, the inventor(s) found that the<br>
related art has the following problem: the S-SCH codewords obtained through the above encoding<br>
method may not all satisfy the conditions that, the first short code in each generated S-SCH<br>
codeword is larger than the second short code, or the first short code in each generated S-SCH<br>
codeword is smaller than the second short code, and the short code distance shall be as small as<br>
possible, and as a result, it may not ensure the reliability of the frame synchronization.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In order to describe the embodiments of the present invention or the technical solution in the<br>
related art clearly, the drawings to be used in the description of embodiments or the related art will<br>
be introduced simply. It is obvious that the following drawings are only some of the embodiments of<br>
the present invention; the persons of technical skill in the field can obtain the other drawings<br>
according to these drawings without paying creative work.<br>
FIG 1 is a schematic flow chart of an encoding method for a frame synchronization signal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>

signal according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The inventor(s) found that, although the encoding method in the related art can acquire all<br>
the S-SCH codewords and a cell ID or a cell group ID corresponding to each S-SCH codeword,<br>
without storing any corresponding table, however, all the S-SCH codewords <br>
acquired through the encoding method of the related art not only include codewords of<br>
  but also include codewords of that is, the magnitude relations<br>
between the first short code and the second short code in each S-SCH codeword are not completely<br>
the same, and a part of the S-SCH codewords have larger short code distance, which cannot satisfy<br>
the above condition that the short code distance should be relatively small. For example, S-SCH<br>
codewords corresponding to the cell IDs or cell group IDs of 30, 60, 61, 90, 91, 92, 120, 121, 122,<br>
123,150,151,152,153, and 154 cannot satisfy the above condition.<br>
The technical solution of the present invention is described clearly and completely in the<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. Apparently, the described embodiments<br>
are only part of the embodiments of the present invention, rather than all the embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention. All the other embodiments that can be achieved by those of people with technical<br>
skill in the field without any creative work based on the embodiments in the present invention fall<br>
within the protection scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is further described below in detail through the embodiments with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a predefined intermediate variable corresponding<br>
to a cell ID or cell group ID is encoded so as to obtain short codes corresponding to the cell ID or<br>
cell group ID, and then S-SCH codewords are generated according to the short codes, thereby<br>
ensuring that, in each S-SCH codeword acquired through encoding, a first short code in each<br>
generated S-SCH codeword is larger than a second short code, or a first short code in each generated<br>
S-SCH codeword is smaller than a second short code, and a short code distance thereof is all<br>
relatively small.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic flow chart of an encoding method for a frame synchronization signal<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the encoding method for a<br>
frame synchronization signal in this embodiment includes the following steps.<br>
In Step 101, a cell ID or cell group ID is converted into a corresponding intermediate<br>
variable according to a predefined rule. That is to say, each cell ID or cell group ID corresponds to<br>
one intermediate variable.<br>
In this step, one converting manner can be adding a predefined offset to each cell ID or cell<br>
group ID sequentially so as to obtain an intermediate variable. Then, the intermediate variable with<br>
the predefined offset added is taken as the cell ID or cell group ID.<br>
The predefined offset can be set arbitrarily, thereby ensuring that, in each S-SCH codeword<br>
corresponding to the cell IDs or cell group IDs with the added predefine offset, each first short code<br>
is all larger than or smaller than a second short code, and a short code distance thereof is smaller<br>
than or equal to a preset threshold value.<br>
In Step 102, the intermediate variable corresponding to the cell ID or cell group ID is<br><br>
encoded so as to obtain short codes corresponding to the cell ID or cell group ID.<br>
In Step 103, S-SCH codewords are generated according to the short codes obtained through<br>
encoding, and the first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is larger than the second short<br>
code, or the first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is smaller than the second short<br>
code., and the short code distance thereof is all smaller than or equal to a predefined threshold value.<br>
The magnitude of the predefined threshold value is associated with the number of cells or cell<br>
groups. Generally, the more the cells or cell groups are, the larger the preset threshold value will be.<br>
For example, when the number of the cells or cell groups is 170, the threshold value set for the short<br>
code distance is 7, and the maximum short code distance in the S-SCH codewords is 6 or 7.<br>
Till now, the flow chart is ended.<br>
The above flow chart is further illustrated below through an example.<br>
It is known that part of the S-SCH codewords obtained through Equation 1 in the related art<br>
cannot satisfy the conditions that the short code distance   is relatively small and<br>
  in all S-SCH codewords, for example, S-SCH codewords<br>
corresponding to the cell IDs or cell group IDs of 30, 60, 61, 90, 91, 92, 120, 121, 122, 123, 150,<br>
151,152,153, and 154. Thus, in this embodiment, an intermediate variable ID' is introduced, which<br>
is converted from a cell ID or cell group ID, and replaces the variable ID in Equation 1 so as to<br>
avoid the cell IDs or cell group IDs of 30, 60, 61, 90, 91, 92, 120, 121,122,123,150,151,152,153,<br>
and 154 from appearing, such that the S-SCH codewords obtained through encoding all satisfy the<br>
above conditions.<br>
For example, in order to avoid obtaining a corresponding S-SCH codeword that cannot<br>
satisfy the conditions when ID=30 according to Equation 1, ID=30 may be converted into ID'=31.<br>
That is to say, a predefined offset is added to the variable ID, and the ID' is used to replace the<br>
variable ID in Equation 1, and then ID=31 is converted into ID'=32 to execute the above<br>
replacement, and so forth.<br>
In practical applications, the converting relation between ID and ID' may be expressed as:<br><br><br>
In the above equation, the value of k changes along with the change of the value of the<br>
variable ID.<br>
For example:<br><br>
The above changing relation between the value of k and the value of the variable ID may be<br>
uniformly expressed as:<br><br>
In the above equation, and the relation between k and k' may be expressed<br><br>
In this embodiment, the symbol represents selecting the maximum integer smaller than a<br>
value.<br>
Finally, the encoding method for obtaining S-SCH codewords corresponding to different<br>
values of the variable ID may be expressed as:<br><br><br>
In the above equations, L is a positive integer, and indicates the number of elements in an<br>
SSC sequence set.<br>
The above encoding method can ensure that, in the S-SCH signals corresponding to different<br>
cell IDs or cell group IDs obtained through encoding, the short code distance is relatively small and<br>
the first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is larger than the second short code, or the<br>
first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is smaller than the second short code.<br>
That is, in the method shown in FIG. 1, the intermediate variable in Step 101 can be acquired<br>
through Equations 3-5, and Step 102 can be realized through Equation 2.<br>
In this embodiment, the number of elements in the SSC sequence set is, for example, 31 and<br>
170 cells or cell groups, and short codes corresponding to each cell ID or cell group ID are obtained<br>
through encoding according to Equations 2-5, with reference to Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As seen from Table 1, the short code distance between two short codes obtained through the<br>
encoding method for a frame synchronization signal in this embodiment and corresponding to each<br>
cell ID or cell group ID is relatively small (the maximum short code distance in Table 1 is only 7),<br>
and for the two short codes in the codeword corresponding to each cell ID or cell group ID, the first<br><br>
short code(S1 in Table 1) is smaller than the second short code (S2 in Table 1). Thus, in this<br>
embodiment, the encoding method for a frame synchronization signal can ensure that, each S-SCH<br>
corresponding to the cell ID or cell group ID can satisfy the conditions that the first short code in<br>
each generated S-SCH codeword is larger than the second short code, or the first short code in each<br>
generated S-SCH codeword is smaller than the second short code, and the short code distance<br>
thereof is relatively small, thereby enhancing the reliability of the frame synchronization.<br>
In practical applications, as for the number of elements L in the SSC sequence set that is set<br>
randomly, Equations 2-5 in this embodiment can also ensure that the obtained S-SCH signals can<br>
satisfy the above conditions.<br>
However, as the value range M of the cell ID or cell group ID increases, that is, as the<br>
number of the required S-SCH codewords increases, the maximum short code distance <br>
between the two short codes corresponding to each cell ID or cell group ID obtained through<br>
encoding also increases, as shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
In addition, Table 3 further lists the maximum short code distances corresponding<br>
to different SSC sequence lengths L when the maximum value range M of the cell IDs or cell group<br>
IDs equals to 170, in which the number of the cell IDs or cell group IDs are the same as that of the<br>
S-SCH codewords. As seen from Table 3, in the case of the same number of S-SCH codewords, the<br>
larger the SSC sequence length L is, the corresponding maximum short code distance will<br>
be.<br><br>
In practical applications, in order to reduce the maximum short code distance <br>
between two short codes corresponding to each cell ID or cell group ID, and further reduce the<br>
ambiguity phenomena during the detection by the UE, an SSC sequence with a larger length may be<br>
preferably used.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the encoding method constituted by Equations<br>
2-5 can be expressed as follows.<br>
A variable ID having a value of a non-negative integer is encoded into two codewords<br>
  in which the codewords are generated<br><br>
according to the following equations.<br><br>
Besides being applied to generate S-SCH codewords for frame synchronization, the above<br>
encoding method is also suitable for encoding in other fields, so as to acquire codewords required in<br>
other fields, as long as the variable ID is a non-negative integer, and L is a positive integer. In this<br>
manner, the variable ID may be represented as a general identifier of M, or N, etc., so as to specify<br>
that the variable is not only used to indicate a cell or a cell group ID.<br>
The manner of converting a cell ID or cell group ID into an intermediate variable in this<br>
embodiment of the present invention has been described above, that is, adding an offset <br>
each cell ID or cell group ID to obtain a corresponding intermediate variable.<br>
It should be noted that, persons skilled in the field can easily come up other manners of<br>
converting the variable ID into an intermediate variable, as well as the encoding method including<br>
other converting manners, in which if it intends to acquire S-SCH codewords required for frame<br>
synchronization, the encoding method including other converting manners also enables the first<br>
short code in each generated S-SCH codeword to be larger than the second short code, or the first<br>
short code in each generated S-SCH codeword to be smaller than the second short code and enables<br><br>
the short code distance to be all smaller than or equal to the preset threshold value.<br>
As for a base station, after two short codes corresponding to the cell ID or cell group ID are<br>
obtained through encoding, the two short codes may be arranged in different order, so that <br>
and   are formed into S-SCH codewords   and<br>
  and then the S-SCH signals respectively identified as codewords Sa(ID)<br>
and Sb(ID) are transmitted at different synchronization symbols in the same frame, so as to realize<br>
the Step 103 in the method shown in FIG. 1. All the S-SCH codewords respectively correspond to<br>
each cell ID or cell group ID one by one according to a sequence of IDs, or all the S-SCH<br>
codewords respectively correspond to each cell ID or cell group ID one by one in any random<br>
sequence.<br>
For example, if the codewords are numbered in the sequence of IDs, a cell or cell group with<br>
an ID of m corresponds to the S-SCH codewords of if the<br>
codewords are numbered in a random sequence, a cell or cell group with an ID of 1 corresponds to<br>
the S-SCH codewords of and a cell or cell group with an ID of 2<br>
corresponds to S-SCH codewords of <br>
As for the UE, the UE can acquire an SSC sequence set including all the SSC sequences<br>
obtained through the above manner, thus realizing Step 103 in the method shown in FIG. 1. Then,<br>
the UE correlates the received S-SCH signals with all the SSC sequences in the SSC sequence set,<br>
so as to identify two SSC sequences (i.e. short codes in the S-SCH codeword)<br>
corresponding to peak correlation values.<br>
As the S-SCH signal further carries information of a cell ID or a cell group ID, the UE may<br>
first acquire the cell ID or cell group ID and then calculate the two SSC sequences corresponding to<br>
the cell ID or call group ID, and then correlate with the received S-SCH signal, without calculating<br>
all the SSC sequences completely.<br>
In practical applications, according to different requirements on the magnitude of the<br><br>
maximum short code distance , Equations 3-5 may be adjusted, or the relation between the<br>
change of value of k and the change of value of variable ID may be adjusted as well. Furthermore,<br>
each variable ID may not be replaced one by one, and instead, the values of the variable IDs<br>
corresponding to the S-SCH codewords that can satisfy the above conditions can be retained, and<br>
then certain values larger than the values of the retained variable IDs are added to serve as the<br>
intermediate variables to replace the values of the variable IDs corresponding to the S-SCH code<br>
words that cannot satisfy the above conditions.<br>
The encoding method for a frame synchronization signal according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention has been described above in great detail. Then, the encoding apparatus for a frame<br>
synchronization signal according to the present invention has been illustrated below in great detail.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic structural view of an encoding apparatus for a frame synchronization<br>
signal according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the encoding<br>
apparatus for a frame synchronization signal in this embodiment includes an encoding unit 1 and a<br>
codeword generating unit 2.<br>
The encoding unit 1 is configured to encode a predefined intermediate variable<br>
corresponding to a cell ID or cell group ID, so as to get short codes corresponding to the cell ID or<br>
cell group ID.<br>
The codeword generating unit 2 is configured to generate S-SCH codewords according to<br>
the short codes obtained through encoding. A first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is<br>
larger than a second short code, or a first short code in each generated S-SCH codeword is smaller<br>
than a second short code, and a short code distance thereof is all smaller than or equal to a preset<br>
threshold value.<br>
The above encoding apparatus further includes intermediate variable configuration unit 3,<br>
configured to convert the cell ID or cell group ID into an intermediate variable according to a<br>
predefined rule. That is to say, the predefined intermediate variable required by the encoding unit 1<br>
for encoding is obtained by converting through the intermediate variable configuration unit 3.<br><br>
The intermediate variable configuration unit 3 further includes an offset configuration<br>
sub-unit 31 and an intermediate variable calculation sub-unit 32.<br>
The offset configuration sub-unit 31 is configured to store a predefined offset, in which the<br>
predefined offset is used to ensure that, in each S-SCH codeword corresponding to the cell IDs or<br>
cell group IDs with the added predefined offset, each first short code in each generated S-SCH<br>
codeword is larger than corresponding second short code, or each first short code in each generated<br>
S-SCH codeword is smaller than corresponding second short code, and a short code distance thereof<br>
is smaller than or equal to a preset threshold value.<br>
The intermediate variable calculation sub-unit 32 is configured to add the predefined offset<br>
to each cell ID or cell group ID sequentially, so as to obtain an intermediate variable of the cell ID<br>
or cell group ID.<br>
Specifically, the offset stored in the offset configuration sub-unit 31 may be determined<br>
according to k calculated based on Equation 4 and Equation in Equation 3. The<br>
offset stored in the offset configuration sub-unit 31 may also be determined according to the above<br>
replacement solution, that is, θ. The intermediate variable calculation sub-unit 32 is configured to<br>
calculate the intermediate variable of the cell ID or cell group ID according to Equation 3.<br>
In this case, the encoding unit 3 is configured to perform encoding according to Equation 2.<br>
Therefore, the above encoding apparatus takes the predefined intermediate variable as the<br>
cell ID or cell group ID corresponding to the S-SCH codeword, so as to ensure that, in all the<br>
S-SCH codewords obtained through encoding the cell ID or cell group ID, each first short code in<br>
each generated S-SCH codeword is larger than corresponding second short code, or each first short<br>
code in each generated S-SCH codeword is smaller than corresponding second short code and a<br>
short code distance thereof is all relatively small. Then, the intermediate variable serving as the cell<br>
ID or cell group ID is encoded, so as to ensure that each obtained S-SCH corresponding to the cell<br>
ID or cell group ID can satisfy the conditions that the first short code in each generated S-SCH<br>
codeword is larger than the second short code, or the first short code in each generated S-SCH<br><br>
codeword is smaller than the second short code, and the short code distance thereof should be<br>
relatively small, thereby enhancing the reliability of the frame synchronization.<br>
Besides being applied to generate S-SCH codewords for frame synchronization, the above<br>
encoding apparatus is also suitable for encoding in other fields, so as to acquire codewords required<br>
in other fields, as long as the variable ID is a non-negative integer, and L is a positive integer. In this<br>
manner, the variable ID may be represented as a general identifier of M, or N, etc, so as to specify<br>
that the variable is not only used to indicate a cell or a cell group ID.<br>
In practical applications, the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 can be configured in the UE and base<br>
station.<br>
If the apparatus is configured in the base station, after two short codes corresponding to each<br>
call or call group ID are obtained through encoding, the two short codes are arranged in different<br>
sequences, so that are formed into S-SCH codewords <br>
  Then, the functional units in the base station for sending signals are<br>
respectively used to transmit the S-SCH signals identified as codewords Sa(ID) and Sb(ID) at<br>
different synchronization symbols within the same frame. All the S-SCH codewords respectively<br>
correspond to each cell ID or cell group ID one by one in a sequence of IDs, or all the S-SCH<br>
codewords respectively correspond to each cell ID or cell group ID one by one in any random<br>
sequence.<br>
If the apparatus is configured in the UE, the UE can also obtain a SSC sequence set<br>
including all the SSC sequences acquired through the above manner, and then other functional units<br>
in the UE for realizing relevant calculations are configured to correlate the received S-SCH signals<br>
with all the SSC sequences in the SSC sequence set, so as to identify two SSC sequences (that is,<br>
short codesin the S-SCH codeword) corresponding to the peak correlation<br>
values. <br>
As the S-SCH signal further carries information of a cell ID or a cell group ID, the UE can<br>
first acquire the cell ID or cell group ID and then calculate the two SSC sequences corresponding to<br><br>
the cell ID or call group ID through the apparatus shown in FIG. 2, and then other functional units in<br>
the UE for realizing relevant calculations are configured to correlate the calculated SSC sequences<br>
with the received S-SCH signals, without calculating all the SSC sequences completely.<br>
It should be noted that, the persons with ordinary technical skill in the field can understand<br>
that the technical solution of the present invention is not only applicable to the secondary<br>
synchronization channel S-SCH, but also applicable to various synchronization channels.<br>
Those with ordinary skill in the field can understand that, all or a part of the steps for<br>
realizing the method in the embodiments may be finished by the relevant hardware instructed by a<br>
computer program, and the program may be stored in a computer-readable storage medium. When<br>
the program is executed, the steps of the method in the above embodiment are performed. The<br>
storage medium includes a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a read only memory (ROM), a random<br>
access memory (RAM), and the like.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the field that various modifications and variations can<br>
be made to the structure of the present invention without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations<br>
