5 INTERMEDIATES<br>
This invention is directed to a process for preparing intermediates that are useful to prepare certain antibacterial A/-formyl hydroxylamine compounds.<br>
Peptide deformylase is a metallopeptidase found in prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria. Protein synthesis in prokaryotic organisms begins with W-formyl methionine (fMet). After initiation of protein synthesis, the formyl group is removed by the enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF); this activity is essential for maturation of proteins. It has been shown that PDF is required for bacterial growth (see Chang et al., J. Bacterid., Vol. 171, pp. 4071-4072 (1989); Meinnel et al., J. Bacterid., Vol. 176, No. 23, pp. 7387-7390 (1994); Mazel et al.,EMBOJ., Vol. 13, No. 4, pp. 914-923 (1994)). Since protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms does not depend on fMet for initiation, agents that will inhibit PDF are attractive candidates for development of new anti-microbial and anti-bacterial drugs.<br>
Co-pending Application Serial No. 10/171,706, filed June 14, 2002 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and WO02/102790, disclose novel A/-formyl hydroxylamine compounds that inhibit PDF and are therefore useful as antibacterial agents. The compounds disclosed therein are certain W-[1-oxo-2-alkyl-3-(N-hydroxyformamido)-propyl]-(carbonylamino-aryl or -heteroaryl)-azacyclo4-7alkanes or thiazacyclo4.7alkanes which are described in more detail hereinafter. An improved process has been discovered for preparing intermediates useful for preparing these N-[1-oxo-2-alkyl-3-(A/-hydroxyforrnamido)-propyl]-(carbonylamino-aryl or -heteroaryl)-azacyclo4.7alkanes or thiazacycl04.7alkanes which makes use of a particular p-lactam intermediate.<br>
The present invention is directed to a novel process for preparing certain intermediates which are useful to prepare certain N-formyl hydroxylamine compounds which are useful for inhibiting bacteria.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is directed to a process for preparing a<br>
compound of the formula (VIII)<br><br><br>
comprising Step A:<br>
contacting a compound of the formula (I)<br><br>
with a compound of the formula (II)<br>
  (ID<br>
in the presence of a carboxy-activating agent, in a suitable solvent under conditions suitable to form a compound of the formula (III)<br><br>
followed by Step B:<br>
contacting compound (111) with a compound of the formula (XIII)<br>
  (XIII)<br><br>
  a suitable solvent, under conditions suitable to form a compound of the formula (IV)<br><br>
followed by Step C:<br>
contacting compound (IV) with a base in a suitable solvent under conditions suitable to form a compound of the formula (V)<br><br>
followed by Step D:<br>
contacting compound (V) with a compound of the formula (VI)<br><br>
in a suitable solvent optionally in the presence of an activator under conditions suitable to form a compound of the formula (Vll)<br><br><br>
followed by Step E:<br>
contacting compound (VII) with a formylating agent in a suitable solvent under conditions suitable to form compound (Vlll);<br>
wherein<br>
Y is a hydroxy protecting group;<br>
each of R2, R3, R4 and R5 is independently hydrogen or an aliphatic group, or (R2 and R3)<br>
and/or (R4 and R5) collectively form a C4-7cycloalkyl;<br>
X is -CH2-, -S-, -CH(OH)-, -CH(OR)-, -CH(SH)-, -CH(SR)-, -CF2-, -C=N(OR)- or -CH(F)-;<br>
wherein<br>
R is alkyl;<br>
G is -OH or -OeMÂ®, wherein M is a metal or an ammonium moiety; Ri is aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
X' is halo;<br>
R' is alkyl or aryl; and<br>
n is 0 to 3, provided that when n is 0, X is -CH2-.<br>
When the desired product is an A/-oxide of an aromatic moiety having a nitrogen heteroatom, e.g., when R1, is formula (X), (Xla) or (Xb), typically a pyridine derivative, it is necessary to perform an additional step after Step E, i.e., to oxidize the N of the aromatic ring (Step F). Therefore, the present invention includes Step F which comprises contacting the compound of formula (Vlll), wherein R1 is heteroaryl having an N heteroatom, with an oxidizing agent to form the corresponding W-oxide derivative.<br>
In addition to the above process comprising Steps A through E or F, the present invention is directed to each of the steps individually, and to any two or more sequential steps.<br>

It will be appreciated that the compounds disclosed herein may exist in the form of optical isomers, racemates ordiastereoisomers. In particular, in the compounds disclosed herein where Ri and R5 are different, the carbon atom to which the R4 and R5 groups are bonded is a chiral center and such compounds can exist in the R, S or racemic forms. It is preferred that the process of the invention prepares the R optically pure form. By "optically pure" is meant that the enantiomeric purity is greater than 50%, preferably greater than 80%, more preferably greater than 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%. The<br>
optically pure R isomer of compound (I) can be used, in which case all subsequent<br>
compounds in the synthesis will remain in the R optically pure form, with respect to the same chiral carbon atom. If an optically pure compound is used as the starting material, purification from the undesired diastereomer can be avoided at later steps. Such R form of<br>
compound (I) is represented below:<br><br><br>
wherein R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above. The optically pure form of compound (I) is novel provided that when either R, or R5 is hydrogen, the other substituent, i.e., R4 or R5, is not hydrogen or methyl. In a particular embodiment of the novel compound of formula (I), R5 is hydrogen andR4 is C2.10alkyl, in a more particular embodiment C2.7alkyl, and in a even more particular embodiment C4alkyl.<br>
In a further embodiment an optically pure compound of formula (I) t R2, R3, and R5 are hydrogen and R4 is alkyl; such a compound has the structure (la):<br><br>
Another embodiment in compound (I) is where R4 is n-butyl, where such compound has the structure (lb)<br><br>
Another embodiment is where R2, R3 and R5 are hydrogen and R4 is n-butyl; such compound has the structure (Ic):<br><br>
More particular examples of the optically pure compound of formula (I) are as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the racemate form of compound (I) can be used and then the R form can be resolved at a later step and the R form used for subsequent steps. For example, the compound formed after opening the p-lactam ring, i.e., compound (VII), the product of Step D, can be resolved into its RS and SS diastereomers and only the RS diastereomer used for subsequent steps. The RS diastereomer of compound (VII) is depicted below:<br><br>
wherein R2, R3, R4 R5 Y, X, R, and n are as defined above, provided that R* and R5<br>
are different.<br>
The diastereoisomers are resolved using standard techniques known in the art, for example, using silica gel column chromatography and an ethyl acetate/hexane solvent system (see, e.g., the methods taught in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 5th edition, J. March, John Wiley and Sons, NY (2001)).<br><br>

Temperature and pressure are not known to be critical for carrying out any of the steps of the invention, i.e.. Steps A through E. Generally, for any of the steps, a temperature of about -10Â°C to about 150Â°C, preferably about 0Â°C to about 80DC, is typically employed. Typically about atmospheric pressure is used for convenience; however, variations to atmospheric pressure are not known to be detrimental. Oxygen is not known to be detrimental to the process, therefore for convenience the various steps can be performed under ambient air, although an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, can be used if desired. For convenience equimolar amounts of reactants are typically used; however molar ratios can vary from about 1 to 2 equivalents, relative to the other reactant. The pH for the various steps is typically about 2 to about 12. The solvent used for the various steps are typically organic solvents, although in some situations aqueous/organic solvents can be used. Examples of suitable solvents include dioxane; mtehylene chloride; dichloromethane; toluene, acetone; methyl ethyl ketone; THF; isopropyl acetate; DMF; alcohols, especially higher branched alcohols, such as f-butanol; and the like.<br>
For Step A, a typical temperature is about 0Â°C to about 50"C, preferably about 5Â°C to about 35Â°C; and a typical reaction time is about 1 hour to about 10 hours, preferably about 2 hours to about 5 hours. A pH of about 2 to about 7, preferably about 3 to about 5, more preferably about 4, is typically employed. The carboxy-activating agent can be for<br><br>
example, DCC, CDMT, EDCI and the like. The amount of carboxy-activating agent employed is typically about 0.5 to about 2 molar equivalents relative to compound (I). The solvent is water or a mixture of water and one or more organic solvents, such as THF, dioxane, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and the like.
