				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Paint is a word used to cover a variety of materials such as enamels, lacquers, varnishes, undercoats, surfacers, primers, sealers, fillers, arid stoppers. Most paints contain a pigment, a resin polymer which acts as a film-former and binder, to bind the pigment particles together, and a solvent as a dilutent. If the pigment is omitted, the paint is referred to as a varnish, sometimes referred to as an enamel, lacquer or topcoat. Lacquers are usually thermoplastic solution paints, whereas enamels are thermosetting paints.<br>
Paint formulating involves the process of selecting the correct paint ingredients in the correct proportions to provide a paint with specific processing and handling properties, as well as the desired final paint properties. The major ingredients of a paint formulation are the binder, the pigment, optional pigment extenders, and water if the paint is a latex paint and solvents if the paint is an oil-based paint. Auxiliary ingredients include defoamers, coalescents, plasticizers, thickeners, non-thickening rheology modifiers, solvents, driers, anti-skinning agents, surfactants, mildewcides, biocides and dispersants. After the paint is formulated and applied to a surface, the paint dries by evaporation of the solvent and/or the water and the binder forms a film containing therein the pigment and the extender particles, if any.<br>
Aqueous-based latex paints are widely used by do-it-yourselfers (DIY) and contractors. They are generally available in four sheens, i.e., gloss, semi-gloss, satin and flat. Sheen selection involves both aesthetic and practical considerations. Different gloss levels can be used to create visual interest as well as help extend the life of the paint. The sheen is determined by the volume of the binder(s), pigment(s), and extender(s), if any, in the paint formulation, as well as the type of binder(s), pigment(s) and extender(s) in the paint formulation.<br>
In addition to the various sheens, paints are formulated to be untinted (white) or tinted to a wide variety of colors using different tint bases, including pastel or light tones, medium or mid-tones, and deep tones. Also, paints are formulated for exterior or interior use.<br>
Finally, paints are formulated to provide certain quality performance properties, e.g., good, better and best.<br>
Retailers and manufacturers handle a wide variety of paint products so that the needs of particular users can be met. Paint products may differ in, among other things, sheen, tint base, use type, and quality levels. Sheen types may include (i) gloss, (ii) semigloss, (iii) eggshell, satin, or low luster, and (iv) flat). The number of tint bases depends on the variety of colors being offered and may be on the order of three or four. The use type may include (i) interior use and (ii) exterior use paints. Quality levels may include (i) basic, (ii) improved, and (iii) premium levels. A retailers or manufacturers offering all combinations of these four sheen levels, four tint bases, two use types, and three quality levels would need to handle ninety six different base paints to satisfy customer needs. On the retail level, this requires a large investment in stock and floor space. From a manufacturing perspective, a significant investment in manufacturing plants and equipment may be necessary to offer this large variety of paints. As a result of this large investment, it has been economically necessary to limit paint manufacturing plaints to large-scale operations. With respect to large scale paint manufacturing operations, is desirable to reduce manufacturing plant cost so that paint manufacturers can have more flexibility in locating their paint plants. With respect to retail outlets, it is desirable to reduce the variety of paint types that a retail store must stock, while still providing for the various paint types needed by consumers. Consequently, improved paint methods of formulating and manufacturing paint are desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, in one aspect, the invention features a paint manufacturing method. The method includes receiving each of a group of fluid prepaints at different inputs of a fluid component mixing system, determining at a computer system a first fluid prepaint ratio, and mixing the fluid prepaints in accordance with the first ratio to form a base paint at an output of the mixing system.<br>
In general, in another aspect, the invention features a paint manufacturing system. The system includes a computer-controlled prepaint mixing system. The prepaint mixing system includes multiple fluid inputs providing for computer-controllable flow of prepaints into the mixing system. The computer system includes a memory storing software<br>
instructions that configured the computer system to receive user input selecting a base paint to be produced, to determine a ratio of fluid prepaints needed to produce the base paint, and to regulate each fluid flow control to establish, in the determined ratio, a flow of fluid prepaints entering the fluid mixing system.<br>
Implementations may include one or more of the following features. Base paints produced by the system may be tinted to form colored paints. The system can produce multiple base paints from the fluid prepaints through the combination of the fluid prepaints in accordance with prepaint ratios associated with each of the other base paints. Base paints can have different application characteristics, such as sheen level. The mixing system may be an in-line mixing system that continuously flows fluid prepaints from its inputs to its output. Base paints can be produced without the addition of non-fluid components. In addition to the prepaints, other fluid components, such as water, may be mixed with the prepaints to form a base paint. Sensor data received at a control computer can be used to indicate a volume of each prepaint entering the mixing system and the computer system can dynamically adjust prepaint flow based on the received sensor data so as to maintain a desired prepaint ratio. The system may use a distributed computer system that includes multiple processing servers and database computers. The system can also include automated purchasing of paint products. To facilitate automated purchasing, the system can process customer orders which can include processing payment transactions by means of data interfaces to consumer credit card, debit card number, and checking account transaction clearing systems. The customer orders may be specified by received data that includes paint quantity and type identifiers. The system may mix paint in accordance with size specified in the customer order. Implementations may be adapted for small-batch (i.e., up to ten gallons) orders that are mixed at a point-of-sale location.<br>
In general, in another aspect, the invention features a paint manufacturing system. The system includes multiple paint manufacturing sites that can each produce paint products. Each manufacturing site also includes a site control computer to control a paint manufacturing process at the site. The system also includes a coordinating computer system that is can exchange manufacturing operations data with each of the site control computers.<br>
Implementations may include one or more of the following features. The site control computer can include instructions to control a ratio of manufacturing ingredients combined to<br>
produce paint. Exchanging manufacturing operations data can include receiving paint supply data at the coordinating computer system from each of the paint manufacturing sites, and the coordinating computer system can automatically schedule a supply delivery based on the received supply data. Each of the paint manufacturing sites can include a fluid mixing system configured to produce a base paint from a plurality of fluid prepaints and water. The coordinating computer system can be configured to receive customer order data from client computers, process received customer order data, and route the customer order data to one of the paint manufacturing sites. Routing of the customer order data can be based on site capacity data received at the coordinating computer system from the manufacturing sites. The manufacturing sites can include sites configured for small-batch point-of-sale operation.<br>
The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Implementations may include one or more of the following advantages. Water-resistance, including resistance to blistering, wet adhesion, and scrub resistance of paints prepared using the invention herein may be improved because, among other things, the presence of thickeners in the pigment and extender prepaints, and preferably in the binder prepaints, permits one to use lesser amounts of stabilizing materials. In addition, there should be less viscosity fluctuation in the final paint formulation due to the equilibration of ingredients in the prepaints. Paint manufacturers can produce paint with a reduced ingredients inventory. Retail paint sellers may be able to reduce the paint inventory and/or floor space needed to offer a full line of paint products desired by consumers.<br>
Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a paint manufacturing system 100 that can be used to manufacture different types of non-reactive base paints from a limited set of fluid prepaints. The system 100 can be adapted for both large-scale and small-scale paint manufacture, as well as paint manufacture at a retail point-of-sale. The system 100 can be used to manufacture a full line of paint products from a limited set of fluid pre-paints. Implementations of the system 100 can, thereby, be used to minimize the number of paint ingredients needed in a paint manufacturer's inventory, and/or to minimize the number of different paint types and retail floor space needed by a vendor selling a full line of paint products,<br>
In the text that follows, an exemplary implementation in which six different prepaints can be mixed to form ninety-six distinct base paints is described. The different base paints can be distinguished based on their end-use application characteristics. Descriptions of sets of example pre-paints follows the description of the system 100. Implementations may use other numbers of prepaints or may be configured to produce a different number of base paints. In the implementation that is described, base paints are paints to which colorants may be added to form a range of colored paints. That is, base paints are similar to paints commonly provided by manufacturers to retail locations and which are subsequently colored at the retail location in response to a color selection by a customer.<br>
A base paint's end-use application characteristic are determined by the ratio of the prepaints combined by system 100 to produce the base paint. End-use application characteristics can include visual characteristics such as paint sheen (e.g., flat, satin, semi-gloss, or gloss), paint application environment (e.g., indoor or outdoor), quality (e.g., basic, improved, or premium), and base tint (e.g., white base, light base, mid-tone base, or deep base). Base tint determines the appearance of a paint when colorants are added to the base paint. A typical manufacturer's consumer paint line may include four different base tints which, by the addition of optional colorants, can provide an extensive palette of colors. These four paint sheens, two application environments, three quality levels, and four base tints, in all their permutations, form a collection of ninety-six base paints (4x2x3x4-96) having different end-use application characteristics. A large number of colored paints may be formed from each base paint by the addition of colorants.<br>
The paint manufacturing system 100 includes prepaint fluid inputs 101-106 that are connected by a valve or other adjustable flow control device 111-116 to a fluid mixing system 120. The valves may be pneumatically, hydraulically, magnetically, electrically, or otherwise controlled to moved between different flow positions (e.g., open and closed positions) and are operatively coupled to a computer system 121 by control links 122. The control links 122 can include additional valve control devices and systems. For example, links 122 can include controllers that modulate air pressure through pneumatic lines connected to pneumatic valves. The computer system can individually modulate the valves to control the ratio of prepaints 141-146 entering a mixing chamber 120. The ratio of prepaints 141-146 entering the mixing chamber 120 determines the composition of the base paint that is formed at an output 124 of the mixing system.<br>
In some implementations, a feedback signal may be provided from each input valve 111-116 to the computer system to enable more precise control over the volume of each fluid entering the mixing chamber. The feedback signal may be produced by pressure measurement sensors, transit-time flowmeters, flow transducers, and other types of flow sensors. Pressure sensors (e.g., pilot tubes and venturi valves) generate a pressure signal based on pressure changes caused by flowing fluids. The pressure signal can processed by the computer system to infer fluid flow rates. A transit-time flowmeter can determine fluid flow rates by measuring the effect of a liquid's flow velocity on bi-directional acoustical signals exchanged between an upstream and a downstream transducer. Flow transducer sensors can be used to produce a feedback signal that varies based on movement of a rotor, paddle, or other physical apparatus inserted in the flowing fluid. Other types of fluid flow sensors also can be used. These feedback signals can be sent to computer 121 over the control network 122 or on a separate network. Implementations can also include data connections 128 to sensors and controlled apparatus located in the prepaint storage tanks 141-146. The data connections 128 can be used, e.g., connect volume monitoring sensors in the prepaint tanks so that the computer system 121 can ensure adequate prepaint volumes before a manufacturing operation is initiated. Prepaint temperature and other data may also be collected from sensors in storage tanks 141-146. Data connections 128 also may be used to send control signals to apparatus located in the prepaint storage 141-146. For example, signals may be sent to temperature control apparatus or to a recirculating pump.<br>
The computer system 121 receives paint selection input data that identifies a base paint to be produced. Paint selection input data may be received by an input device directly coupled to the computer system 121 and/or may be received over a network 130 from one or more client computers 131-133. Fig. 2 shows an example user interface which can be used to receive paint selection input data from a user. Internet-based technologies can be used to implement the user interface 200. For example, user interface 200 may be implemented using a hypertext markup language (HTML) form that is sent from a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) enabled computer 121 to a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer ®, or Netscape Navigator ®) that is executed at a client computer 131-133.<br>
The interface 200 includes drop-down graphical user interface input controls 211-215 to receive a user's choice of a sheen level 211 (e.g., flat, satin, semi-gloss, gloss), a tint level 212 (e.g., white base, light base, mid-tone base, deep base), a use type 213 (e.g., interior, exterior), a quality level 214 (e.g., basic, improved, premium), and a volume to be produced 215. Implementations can also include special options such as the formulation of extra thick paint 216. Interface 200 includes charts 220 and 240 showing the relative volumes of the prepaints (identified by legend 230). In general, the use of such charts 220, 240 would be limited to sophisticated purchasers needing knowledge of particular paint formulations.<br>
A user interface for do-it-yourself painters (i.e., a user interface used in a retail store or on a general-access web site) may be simplified. For example, charts 220, 240 and legend 230 can be eliminated and, rather than specifying the Tint level (212), the user may identify the color that the base paint is to be colored. Computer 121 can query a database 123 table to determine an appropriate tint level for the selected color. Such a database query may be implemented using a simple database table that includes records associating available colors with tint levels. It should be understood that available software and computer technologies allow a large number of other variations in the interface 200 and a large number of other types of interfaces for the receipt of paint selection input data. For example, a bar code scanner may be used to scan a bar code printed on a paint chip sample card. The data received from the bar code scan may be used to query a paint formulation database.<br>
After the base paint selection data is received by the computer 121, a formulation of the base paint is determined. The base paint formulation can be determined by querying a database 123. Figs. 3A-3D show portions of an example database table that specifies prepaint<br><br>
formulations used to produce the ninety-six different base paint formulations (i.e., all permutations of the four sheen levels, four base tints, two environmental applications, and three quality levels of the present exemplary implementation). The database table 3A-3D include ninety-six base paint formulation records (each being a separate row of the database table). Each base paint formulation record includes, among other things, six fields (shown in columns labeled "PPl_Vol", "PP2_Vol" "PP3_Vol" "PP4_Vol" "PP5_Vol" "PP6_Vol") that indicate relative quantities of each pre-paint in a particular base paint.<br>
Base paint formulation records also can specify other fluids to be added to manufacture a particular base paint. For example, viscosity can be decreased by adding water (relative water quantity is indicated in the "Water_Vol" column) or increased by adding a thickening agent. The system 100 can include one or more fluid valves 110 through which this additional fluids are added. In some implementations, software-implemented algorithms, expert systems, and/or other programmed logic can be used to compute prepaint ratios.<br>
After computing the ratio of prepaints, the computer system 121 controls prepaint 111-116 valves, and any other fluid 110 flow control valves, and processes feedback signals to control the volume of prepaints and fluids entering a mixing system 120. Implementations can use different types of mixing systems 120 to mix the prepaints and fluids. In an in-line continuous mixing implementation, the prepaints and any other fluids are simultaneously admitted to the mixing system 120 at relative flow rates substantially equal to the relative ratio of the prepaints desired in the final paint product. As the paints flow through the mixing system 120, they are combined in one or more mixing chambers to form a substantially uniform mix of the prepaints. In a simple example, an in-line continuous mixing system 120 can be formed by joining the fluid and prepaint lines 150-156 into a common output line 124. Baffles may be added to the output line 124 or placed in a chamber to help ensure uniform mixing of the fluids and prepaints. Alternatively, the computer system 121 can control the valves 150-156 to sequentially add a measured volume of each prepaint 141-146 to a fixed-capacity mixing chamber 120. When the needed volume of each prepaint is added to the mixing chamber, the prepaints may be agitated to combine them in a uniform mix.<br>
In a small-batch implementation, the mixing chamber 120 can be a retail paint container (e.g., a quart-sized or gallon-sized paint can) and the system 100 can dispense each of the prepaints directly into the container. The container can then be manually capped and<br>
placed in a mixing/agitation machine to uniformly mix the pre-paints. A small-batch implementation may use measurement and dispensing hardware similar to that available in commercial dispensing systems (e.g., a Corob Stratos™ dispensing system or dispensing systems such as those manufactured by Fluid Management® or GSE Dispensing, Inc.). Such hardware can be supplemented by the unique software, data, networking, and prepaint components of system 100.<br>
System 100 may include automated manufacture of paint products in response to a customer purchase order received at a terminal 131-133. In an Internet-enabled implementation, each terminal 131-133 may be a home computer executing web browser software and connected over a network 130 (e.g., the Internet) to the base paint manufacturing computer system 121. To process request from web browsers at the computers 13 1-133, the computer system 121 may include web server software that responds to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request from the browsers. The web server software can be a process executed by the computer 121 or by another computer system 140. The web server responds to HTTP request from a web browser by sending hypertext markup language (HTML) data files (also known as web pages) to the browsers. Using web-based technologies, information can be provided to the user from a variety of different data systems 121 and 140 and the users can input data that are provided to different systems 121 and 140. This capability facilities the implementation of distributed versions of the manufacturing system of Fig. 1.<br>
Returning again to Fig. 200, a user can enter a paint purchase order by activating a paint purchasing function (e.g., by clicking on the "Place Order" button 251). When the paint purchase function is initiated, data may be sent to an order processing computer 140 which, in turn, results in a purchase order form being returned to the client computer 131-133 and presented to the user. Purchase order data can then be entered at the client computer by a user and returned to the purchase order processing computer 140. The purchase order data may be input using a HTML-based form and can include a quantity of paint being ordered as well as payment information and a selection of a pickup or delivery address. Payment information can include, e.g., a credit card number, a debit card number, an account identifier, or a checking account identifier. Purchase order processing compmter 140 may include an interface to a credit clearing computer to process credit card transactions. After the user's<br>
payment has cleared, the computer 140 may forward data to the paint manufacturing control computer 121 indicating the type and quantity of paint to produce. Naturally, using conventional computer hardware and software technology, the functions of the purchase order processing computer 140 and paint manufacturing computer 121 and any associated databases can be combined on a single computer or spread over a distributed network of computers and databases.<br>
Implementations can use a computer system to process customer orders and distribute them among different paint manufacturing sites 100. Fig. 4 shows a distributed manufacturing implementation 400 wherein the order processing computer 140 is coupled over the network 130 to multiple (i.e., five) paint manufacturing sites (shown as blocks labeled 100A to 100E). Each of the paint manufacturing sites 100A to 100E of Fig. 4 can include the data processing and manufacturing equipment shown as included in element 100 of the implementation of Fig. 1. Other elements of Fig. 4 (i.e., network 130, clients 131-133, and order processing computer 140) may be similar to like-numbered elements of Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the order processing computer 140 functions (a "coordinating computer system") can exchange manufacturing data with the manufacturing sites 100-A to 100-E. Manufacturing data can include, among other things, customer order data and the computer system 140 may include functionality to automatically route customer orders to an appropriate manufacturing site 100-A to 100-E. Customer orders may be routed based on the customer's geographic location. A customer may enter a delivery address, zip code, phone number or other identifier associated with a geographic location when placing an order at a client computer 131-133, and the order processing computer 140 can route the order to a manufacturing site 100-A to 100-E based on the location identifier. To route the order, the computer system 140 can query a database mapping the geographic identifier to a particular manufacturing site location. For example, the order processing system 140 may select a retail store at which the paint can be manufactured, route the order to that store, and inform the customer of the store's location. Routing of orders may be based on other factors such the cost to ship paint from a particular manufacturing site 100-A to 100-E to a final delivery point.<br>
A manufacturing site 100-A to 100-E can also be selected by the system 140 based on available capacity or on availability of prepaints needed for a particular customer order. For<br>
example, the order processing system 140 may receive data from the control computer 121 at each site 100-A to 100-E indicating the amount of spare operating capacity of each of the sites and the volume of prepaints 141-146 at each site 100-A to 100-E. The manufacturing site can then be selected based on available capacity and prepaint supplies. In some cases, the order processing system 140 may determine that no single site has adequate capacity; in such cases, an order may be split among multiple sites. The order processing system 140 may also use capacity data and supply information to automatically schedule deliveries of raw materials, i.e., prepaints, to a site 100-A to 100-E.<br>
As discussed, the prepaints used in the system 100 are selected so that they can be used to form multiple different base paints. To do so, it is desirable that the prepaints be mutually compatible. Mutually compatible prepaints are those that can be combined without undesirable side effects. In addition, the prepaints may be selected so that they form a non-reactive base paint. As used herein, in a reactive paint, combining the ingredients of the paint initiates a progressive chemical reaction curing the paint. In contrast, in a non-reactive paint, combining the ingredients of the paint does not lead to a rapid progressive chemical reaction curing the paint. Water-based latex paints are an example of a non-reactive paint.<br>
In some implementations, the base paint manufacturing system 100 may be combined with a system to add colorants directly to the mixing system; 120 to produce a final tinted paint product. Alternatively, the output 124 may be coupled to a separate colorant system or the base paint may be put into one-gallon cans, barrels, or other containers and tinted at a later time. Implementations of the system 100 may dynamically change the type of paint being produced. For example, in a small-batch implementation, after producing a gallon of a glossy interior paint, the computer 121 can alter the flow rate of the valves 111-116 so as to set the system 100 to produce a gallon of glossy exterior paint.<br>
Methods of formulating and selecting prepaints will now be described. To formulate prepaints, one needs to consider the range of key properties required by the complete paint line and formulate a set of ingredients (hereinafter referred to as "prepaint") which are capable of being blended in various combinations to cover the key properties required for the particular paint line. The number of prepaints required will depend on how flexible the final matrix of paint needs to be. Specific properties can be improved by adding paint additives which enhance the desired property.<br>
We have discovered that we are able to achieve this goal by employing a set of N prepaints sufficient to formulate at least 2N different paints, including:<br>
1.	at least one fluid prepaint x, including at least one white opacifying pigment;<br>
2.	at least one fluid prepaint y, including at least one extender pigment; and<br>
3.	at least one fluid prepaint z, including at least one polymeric binder;<br>
wherein N is at least 3, preferable 3-10;<br>
wherein the minimum number of each of prepaint x, y, and z is 1; and wherein the maximum number of each of prepaint x, y, and z is N-2; and wherein prepaints x, y, and z are mutually compatible. We have also discovered a method of rationalizing the number and types of ingredients to formulate a complete set of paints, including the steps of:<br>
1.	providing a set of N prepaints sufficient to formulate at least 2N different paints,<br>
including:<br>
a.	at least one fluid prepaint x, including at least one white opacifying pigment;<br>
b.	at least one fluid prepaint y, including at least one extender pigment; and<br>
c.	at least one fluid prepaint z, including at least one polymeric binder;<br>
wherein N is at least 3, preferable 3-10;<br>
wherein the minimum number of each of prepaint x, y, and z is 1; and wherein the maximum number of each of prepaint x, y, and z is N-2; and wherein prepaints x, y, and z are mutually compatible;<br>
2.	dispensing predetermined amounts of prepaint(s) x, prepaint(s) y, and prepaint(s) z<br>
into a container or an application device to form a paint.<br>
The method may further include the step of mixing prepaint(s) x, prepaint(s) y, and prepaint(s) z before or after they are dispensed into the container of before they are dispensed into the application device.<br>
The method may further include the step of adjusting the viscosity of dispensed prepaints before or after they are dispensed into the container or before they are dispensed into the application device using thickener, water or a mixture thereof.<br>
The method may further include the step of adding additional materials that enhance the application or final performance properties of the paint.<br>
The method may further include the step of adding at least one colorant to the dispensed prepaints.<br>
The method may be carried out at a paint manufacturing facility, a point-of-sale or at point-of-use and may be controlled by a computer.<br>
If one key property is varied (for example, sheen level, tint base, use type, or quality type) then the complete set of paints can be made from one each of prepaint x, prepaint y and prepaint z (N=3). The complete set of paints will contain at least 6 paints (2N), preferably 9 paints (3N), more preferably 12 paints (4N) and most preferably 15 paints (5N). If two key properties are varied (for example, two selected from sheen level, tint base, use type, and quality type) then the complete set of paints can be made from at least one each of prepaint x, prepaint y and prepaint z and least one additional prepaint x, y or z (N=4), which depends on which key properties are to be varied. The complete set of paints will contain at least 8 paints (2N), preferably 12 paints (3N), more preferably 16 paints (4N) and most preferably 20 paints (5N).<br>
If three key properties are varied (for example, three selected from sheen level, tint base, use type, and quality type) then the complete set of paints can be made from at least one each of prepaint x, prepaint y and prepaint z and at least two additional prepaint x, y or z (N=5), which depends on which key properties are to be varied. The complete set of paints will contain at least 10 paints (2N), preferably 15 paints (3N), more preferably 20 paints (4N) and most preferably 25 paints (5N).<br>
If four key properties are varied (for example, four selected from sheen level, tint base, use type, and quality type) then the complete set of paints can be made from at least one each of prepaint x, prepaint y and prepaint z and at least three additional prepaint x, y or z (N=6), which depends on which key properties are to be varied. The complete set of paints will contain at least 12 paints (2N), preferably 18 paints (3N), more preferably 24 paints (4N) and most preferably 30 paints (5N).<br>
This technique may be continued to vary as many additional key properties as desired.<br>
In each of the above examples one is designing the prepaints so that they cover a wide formulation space so that the desired final paint properties lie within the blend space defined with the prepaints at the vertices. In many cases the prepaints will not by themselves be<br>
practical paints. But by pushing the prepaints to these extremes one can maximize the blend space available for the system. When the prepaints, additives and colorants are all fully compatible, they can be blended at any ratio without inducing colloidal instability, and one can blend them in any combination needed to achieve the desired paint profile.<br>
This technique is similar to the design principles used in statistical experimental design and analysis of mixture component designs, however, instead of designing a mixture space to explore the response surface within it, one is designing the boundaries of the mixture space to maximize the flexibility of the paint system.   The key to success is to have full compatibility of the individual ingredients and prepaints across the mixture space.<br>
Paint properties can be predicted in a number of ways. One approach is to develop response surface models of the blend space using standard Mixture Component experimental design statistical tools. These simple statistical models can then be used by a linear optimization program, by a massive grid search or by a graphical analysis tool. Another approach is to simply use empirical methods to determine which blends are needed for specific paint lines, then incorporate those simple empirical recipes in the paint making machine software.<br>
An extension of the techniques is to have the paint machine automatically pretest certain key properties (e.g., viscosity, forced dry gloss or color) and make minor adjustments during the formulating of the paint from prepaints. Having feedback loops in the paint machine can provide more precise matching of color, gloss, and viscosity targets.<br>
As used herein, paint ingredients are "compatible" if they can be combined in the various prepaints to provide the desired properties without any negative side effects on other paint ingredients in the prepaint and on the properties that the other ingredients are intended to provide in the final paint. The paint ingredients also have to be compatible in the final paint which is formulated by mixing the various prepaints. If the prepaints, optional additives included to enhance specific paint properties, and colorants are fully compatible, i.e., they can be blended at any ratio without inducing colloidal instability, then they can be blended in any combination falling within the formulation space needed to achieve the desired property profile in the final paint.<br>
It is preferred that the all fluid prepaints employed in the method of the invention have the same or similar viscosities to aid in mixing.<br>
The water-resistance properties, including blister resistance, wet adhesion, and scrub resistance of the final paints prepared by the method of the invention, are expected to be improved because of the use of lower amounts of stabilizing materials such as surfactants. In addition, viscosity fluctuation in the final paint formulation are expected to reduced because of the equilibration of ingredients in the prepaints.<br>
The above prepaints are formulated to maximize the flexibility of paint manufacturing. Rather than purchasing individual paint ingredients, paint manufacturers and even buyers at point-of-sale and point-of-use (paint stores, paint departments, contractors and homeowners), can purchase the set of prepaints to prepare a complete set of paints. These sets of prepaints will contain at least one each of prepaints x, y and z and possibly additional variants of each depending upon the formulating flexibility desired. Optionally, the above prepaints are mixed with an additional prepaint which includes at least one colorant, such as a colored pigment or dye.<br>

White opacifying pigments useful in the method and prepaint of the invention include white pigments which impart white scattering power to the paint across all visible wave lengths without a high degree of absorption.

The voided latex particles have a glass transition temperature, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry at a rate of 20°C, of at least about 20°C, preferably at least about 50°C. The higher the glass transition temperature, the harder the particle is and less likely it is to collapse. If the voided latex particles collapse, they are unable to contribute to hiding. They may be prepared by conventional polymerization processes known in the art, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,784,391, 4,798,691, 4,908,271, and 4,972,000, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, as well as Japanese Patent Applications 60/223,873, 61/62510, 61/66710, 61/86941, 62/127336, 62/156387, 01/185311, and 02/140272.

Binders are polymers or prepolymers which form the primary film of the paint. Binders bind the pigment and/or extenders, provide the required paint flow, and determine the gloss and hardness of the final paint film. The binders selected for the prepaints will depend upon the final use of the formulated paints. Binders suitable for exterior paints are generally suitable for interior paints, but that binders suitable for interior paints may not be suitable for exterior paints.<br>
