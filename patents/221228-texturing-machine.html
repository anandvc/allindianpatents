The invention relates to a texturing machine for crimping threads, according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Such texturing machines are used to crimp and stretch a smooth presented thread in a texturing process.  For this purpose, the texturing machine comprises, in one of a plurality of processing stations, a plurality of processing units and a winding device which are disposed in combination in a machine frame to form a thread path.  The processing units such as, for example, delivery roller mechanisms, heating devices, cooling devices, texturing units, tangle devices and lubricating devices, are frequently disposed over two tiers in the machine frame. The known texturing machines therefore require special auxiliary devices in order that, at the start of a process, the presented thread can be fed into the processing units as far as the winding system.  Thus, the practice of pneumatically guiding the thread through guide tubes for the purpose of initial feeding is known from, for example, FR 2 380 972 or FR 2 695 631 Al.  The thread is thus guided through a guide tube to just before the winding device and, at the end of the guide tube, blown out through a blast opening.  Disposed in the blast direction in this case, at a distance from the blast opening, is a deflection plate which deflects the thread towards the winding device.  In the winding device, the thread is then received by a suction appliance.<br>
In general, however, the known appliances have the disadvantage that the thread undergoes a directed deflection only if the blast effect is very strong and, likewise, it is only possible for the loose thread to be<br><br>
taken up by a very strong suction.  In addition, there is the problem of the thread adhering to the deflection plate, due to the pretreatment lubricant residue adhering to the<br>
thread.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to develop a texturing machine of the initially stated type in such a way that, in a highly reliable and simple manner, the thread can be automatically guided into and fed into the winding device before the start of a process.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, by a texturing machine having the features according to Claim 1 and by means of a method for the initial feeding of a thread in a winding device, having the features according to Claim 8.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the sub-claims.<br>
The invention is characterized in that the thread is guided without deflection for the purpose of transfer into the winding device.  For this purpose, the blast opening of the guide tube and the receiving opening of the suction device are disposed opposite one another.  In this case, the guide tube is of such adjustable design that the blast opening can be held in a plurality of positions relative to the receiving opening for the purpose of transfer and feeding of the thread.  Consequently, the functions "thread transfer" and "thread feed" can advantageously be performed from different positions.  It is necessary to ensure, particularly when blowing the thread out of the blast opening, that the loose thread end can be reliablv received<br><br>
by the receiving opening of the suction device.  This requires that, in respect of the opposing disposition of the blast opening and the receiving opening, there be no obstacles between the latter and that adequate distances be maintained from machine parts of the winding device.  In addition, the thread can easily be fed into the winding device directly following transfer into the suction device, without additional thread guide devices.  It is thus possible for the thread to be threaded-in and fed into the winding device in a very short time, so that very short process interruptions can be achieved, for example, following a thread breakage.<br>
In order, on the one hand, to span a wide distance between the blast opening and the receiving opening and, on the other hand, to prevent the thread from adhering to machine parts, provision is made, according to an advantageous development of the invention, whereby the guide tube with the blast opening is adjusted between two positions.  When the blast opening is in a transfer position, the thread is blown out, for the purpose of transfer, towards the receiving opening.  This position is advantageously selected so as to provide for the thread a flight course which is as optimal as possible.  After the thread has been received by the receiving opening of the suction device and is guided between the blast opening and the receiving opening, the guide tube can be moved into the feeding position.  In this position, the thread is advantageously guided for the purpose of feeding into the winding system.<br>
For the purpose of adjusting the guide tube, it is proposed in this case that an end region of the guide tube with the blast opening be of a telescopic or flexible design.<br><br>
Pneumatic conveyance within the guide tube thus remains unaffected by the adjustability at the end of the guide tube for the purpose of positioning the blast opening.  The movement in this case is preferably executed by an associated controllable actuator disposed in the end region of the guide tube.<br>
A particularly simple variant of the invention, which does not require additional auxiliary means, is achieved by the advantageous development according to Claim 5.  For this, the blast opening of the guide tube is disposed before a winding station, on an intake side of the winding device, and the receiving opening of the suction device is disposed after the winding station, on a outlet side of the winding device.  Following transfer of the thread from the blast opening to the receiving opening, the thread is thus advantageously guided directly through the winding station. In the winding station, for example, the thread can be received by a capture device and wound on to a tube.<br>
In the case of a particularly advantageous development of the invention, the thread is guided into a traversing plane by the movement of the guide tube from the transfer position to the feeding position.  Provided in the traversing plane is a thread guide, for traversing the thread while the latter is being wound up to form a bobbin, which thread guide thus automatically receives the thread held in the traversing plane and guides same for the purpose of feeding and capture.<br>
In order that the thread can be threaded into other processing devices at the same time, it is proposed, according to a preferred development, that a lubricating<br><br>
device be disposed after the blast opening of the guide tube in the feeding position.  In this case, the thread can be automatically fed into the lubricating device by the movement of the guide tube from the transfer position to the feeding position.<br>
The method according to the invention is characterized in that the thread can be guided into the winding device and fed-in in a short time, in a highly reliable and reproducible manner.<br>
The invention is described more fully in the following on the basis of an exemplary embodiment of the texturing machine according to the invention and with reference to the appended drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1        shows, in schematic form, a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the texturing machine according to the invention; Fig. 2        show, in schematic form, portions of a and Fig. 3    further exemplary embodiment of the texturing<br>
machine according to the invention.<br>
Represented schematically in Figure 1 is a processing station of a texturing machine according to the invention. The texturing machine comprises a multiplicity of processing stations, in each of which a thread is textured and wound up.  Each of the processing stations thus has the same structure, so that the individual processing units of the texturing machine are described in the following with reference to the thread path of one processing station.<br><br>
A supply bobbin 1 is placed on a pin 2 in a creel 3.  The supply bobbin 1 holds a smooth, thermoplastic thread 36. The thread 36 is drawn off overhead from the supply bobbin 1, through a first delivery roller mechanism 5.  A thread guide 4 is disposed after the supply bobbin 1 for this purpose.  From the delivery roller mechanism 5, the thread 36 passes into a texturing zone.  The texturing zone consists of a texturing unit 8, a heating device 6 and a cooling device 7.  In this example, the texturing unit 8 consists of a false twist spindle, so that the false twist produced in the thread 3 6 is fixed within the heating device 6 and the cooling device 7.  The texturing unit 8 is preceded by a deflection roller 9.<br>
The thread 3 6 is drawn off out of the texturing zone through a second delivery roller mechanism 10, and delivered into an aftertreatment zone.  A second heating device 11 is provided in the aftertreatment zone, a third delivery roller mechanism 14 being disposed after the heating device 11.  The delivery roller mechanism 14 consists of a godet delivery mechanism, with the godet roller 16 and the idler roller 17.<br>
The delivery roller mechanisms 5 and 10 are, for example, so-called nip delivery roller mechanisms, in which the thread is guided between a driven delivery shaft and a pressure roller bearing on the circumference of the delivery shaft.<br>
A winding device 2 0 with a winding station is disposed after the delivery roller mechanism 14.  The winding station comprises a pivotally mounted bobbin holder 24, at the free end of which a tube 23 is tensioned.  For the<br><br>
purpose of winding a bobbin, the tube 23 bears on the circumference of a driving roller 22 which is driven by a drive at an essentially constant circumferential speed. Preceding the winding-on of the thread 3 6 on to a bobbin, there is a traversing device 21 though which the thread is guided back and forth within the bobbin width.  Such traversing devices may comprise a traversing thread guide 37 driven by a reversing threaded shaft or a traversing thread guide 37 driven by a belt drive.  The traversing thread guide 37 moves in parallel to the driving roller 22 and, with a preceding head thread guide 39, realizes a traversing plane.  The head thread guide 3 9 is disposed, with a lubricating device 38, on a carrier 40.  In the operating position, the thread 36 is guided in succession through the lubricating device 38 and the head thread guide 39.  The head thread guide 3 9 is in this case disposed after the lubricating device 38, and forms the end of the traversing triangle.<br>
To enable the thread 36 to be fed at the start of a process of the processing station, the texturing machine comprises a threading-in device for pneumatically conveying the thread 3 6.  This threading-in device consists, essentially, of the guide tubes 12 and 18.  For this purpose, the guide tube 12, with an injector 13, is connected at the output of the second heating device 11.  A suction opening 33, through which an air stream is sucked in when the inj ector 13 is activated, is thereby formed on the intake side of the heating device 11.<br>
The guide tube 12 joined to the heating device 11 has a blast opening 34 at its opposite end.  The blast opening 34 opens towards an intake side of the delivery roller<br><br>
mechanism 14.  Realized on the opposite, outlet, side of the delivery roller mechanism 14 is a suction opening 28 of a second guide tube 18, the blast opening 34 of the first guide tube 12 and the suction opening 28 of the second guide tube 18 being opposite one another in a plane.<br>
The guide tube 18 is connected to an injector 19, which generates within the guide tube 18 an air stream directed in the direction of the thread path.  The guide tube 18 terminates immediately before the winding device 20.  A blast opening 27 is realized on an end portion 31 of the guide tube 18.  The end portion 31 is connected to the rest of the guide tube 18 through a flexible sleeve 32.  An actuator 30, which acts on the end portion 31 of the guide tube 18, is provided for adj usting the position of the blast opening 27.  The blast opening 2 7 at the end of the guide tube 18 is located opposite a receiving opening 26 of a suction device 25.  The suction device 25 is assigned to the winding device 2 0 in order to receive and discharge the thread 3 6 during the bobbin changing operations.  The lubricating device 38 and the head thread guide 39 are disposed after the blast opening 27 on the guide tube 18.<br>
The end region 31 of the guide tube 18 can be adjusted, with the blast opening 27, between an upper transfer position and a lower feeding position.  Fig. 1 shows the guide tube 18 in the feeding position, the transfer position of the guide tube 18 being indicated by a broken line.<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment shown, the suction device 25 with the receiving opening 26 is disposed after the driving roller 22, on the outlet side of the winding<br><br>
station in the direction of the thread path, and the blast end 27 of the guide tube 18 is disposed before the driving roller 22, on the intake side of the winding station in the direction of the thread path.  The thread is guided transversely through the winding station.  This renders possible a transfer and feed-in of the thread in which the latter is handled with particular care, without relatively large thread loops.  It is also possible, however, for the suction device 25 to be positioned immediately after the traversing device 21 and before the driving roller 22.<br>
Figure 1 shows the processing station of the represented exemplary embodiment of the texturing machine immediately prior to the commencement of processing.  In this case, the running thread 3 6 is already guided through the successively disposed processing units 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 14.  Within the winding device 20, the thread 36 is then taken up by the suction device 25 and guided to a waste container.<br>
For the purpose of feeding the thread 36, it is first guided manually, by means of a suction pistol.  After the thread 3 6 has been inserted in the processing units 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10, the thread 3 6 is received via the suction opening 33 at the intake of the heating device 11, and guided by the air stream in the guide tube 12 as far as the blast opening 34.  The thread 36 blown out of the guide tube 12 is captured, on the opposite side of the delivery roller mechanism 14, by the suction opening 33 of the second guide tube 18.  The thread 36, which is guided in parallel to the delivery roller mechanism 14, can then already be automatically fed into the godet roller delivery mechanism by means of a feeding device 15.  The feeding<br><br>
device 15 could consist, for example, of a rotary actuator and a pivoting thread guide, and feed the thread onto the delivery roller mechanism 14, wrapping it around several times.<br>
After the thread 36 has been received by the guide tube 18, it is blown out of the blast opening 27 by the air stream generated by the injector 19 in the guide tube 18 and received by the receiving opening 2 6 of the suction device 25.  For this, the end portion 31 of the guide tube 18 with the blast opening 27 is held in the upper transfer position (indicated by a broken line) .  When the blast opening 27 is in the transfer position, the thread 36 can be blown unimpeded towards the opposing receiving opening 26 of the suction device 25.  Following transfer, the thread 36 is guided in a guide plane between the blast opening 27 and the receiving opening 26, and discharged via the suction device 25 to a waste yarn container.  In  order to feed the thread into the winding station of the winding device 20, the actuator 30 is activated in order to guide the end portion 31 of the guide tube 18 with the blast opening 27 into the lower feeding position.  In the feeding position, the guide plane realized between the blast opening 27 and the receiving opening 26 is substantially the same as the traversing plane in which the thread 36 is guided back and forth during winding-up to form a bobbin.  In this state, the thread is received by the traversing thread guide 37 of the traversing device 21 and received for the purpose of capturing and winding on to an empty tube.  The process can then be commenced by pivoting of the bobbin holder 24, the thread being captured by means of the traversing thread guide 37 and a capture device, not represented here in greater detail, and wound on the tube 23.  The operation of<br><br>
feeding in the thread 36 in the processing station of the texturing machine is thus completed.<br>
In the transition from the transfer position to the feeding position, the thread 36 is simultaneously inserted by the guide tube 18 in the lubricating device 38 and the head thread guide 39, so that the thread 36 receives an application of lubricant and is supplied to the winding system via head thread guide 39.<br>
In the case of the texturing machine represented in Figure 1, the injectors 13 and 19 for pneumatic conveyance of the thread can be switched off during the winding-up operation. It is also possible, however, for the inj ectors 13 and 19 not to be switched off during the winding-up operation, in order to assist conveyance of the thread.  This enables, in particular, low thread tensions to be achieved in winding up the thread.<br>
Represented schematically in Figures 2 and 3 is a partial view of a further exemplary embodiment of the texturing machine according to the invention.  In this case, components which perform the same function have identical references.  The following description applies to both figures unless express reference is made to one of the figures.<br>
Only the processing units immediately preceding the winding device 20 in a machine frame 45 are shown.  In this case, the texturing machine devices on the machine frame 45 can be operated from two sides, the operating side 46 and the doffing side 47.  On the doffing side 47 of the machine frame 45, the winding devices 20 with a plurality of<br><br>
winding stations could be disposed next to and above one another.  Figures 2 and 3 show the winding station of a processing station.  From the doffing side 47 it is possible both to remove the wound bobbins from the winding system and transport them away.<br>
The processing units, such as a texturing unit, delivery roller mechanisms and tangle device, which could be tended by an operator from an operating passage, could preferably be disposed on the opposite, operating, side 4 6 of the machine frame 45.  In order to guide the thread 36 automatically from one machine side 46 to the opposite machine side 47 and into the winding station of the winding device 20, each processing station has guide tubes 12 and 18 which transport the thread 3 6 pneumatically.  For this purpose, a delivery roller mechanism 10 is disposed in the lower region of the machine frame 45, on the operating side 4 6.  The delivery roller mechanism 10 consists in this case of the godet roller 16 and the idler roller 17, the thread 36 being wound around them several times.  Opposite the delivery roller mechanism 10, on the opposite, doffing, side 47, is a further delivery roller mechanism 14.  The delivery roller mechanism 14 likewise consists of a godet roller 16 and an idler roller 17, the thread being wound around them several times.  Disposed in the thread path between the delivery roller mechanism 10 and the delivery roller mechanism 14 are a heating device 11 and a guide tube 12 adjoining the input and output of the heating device 11.  The guide tube 12 is connected to an injector 13 which generates an air stream flowing in the direction of the thread path.  The guide tube 12 thus forms a suction opening 33 on the intake side.  Formed opposite it, at the end of the guide tube 12, is a blast end 34.  A severing<br><br>
Diaae 31, on a holder 32, is assigned to the suction opening 33 in the input region of the heating device 11. On the doffing side 47, the winding device 20 is disposed above the delivery roller mechanism 14.  In the direction of the thread path, in a winding station associated with the processing station, the winding device 20 comprises a traversing device 21, a driving roller 22 and a suction device 25.  A tube or bobbin 48 is held on the circumference of the driving roller 22 by a bobbin holder 24.<br>
A guide tube 18 is disposed in the machine frame 45 for the purpose of guiding the thread from the delivery roller mechanism 14 to the winding device 20.  The guide tube 18 has a suction opening 28, which is disposed on the side of the delivery roller mechanism 14 that is opposite the blast opening 34 of the guide tube 12.  The blast opening 34 and the suction opening 28 thus face one another at an angle. At the other end, the guide tube 18 has a blast opening 27 which faces towards the traversing device 21.<br>
A guide plate 44 is disposed at a distance from the delivery roller mechanism 14, in the blast and suction directions, between the blast opening 34 of the guide tube 12 and the suction opening 28 of the guide tube 18.  The guide plate 44 has a curvature which deflects the direction of the air stream emerging from the blast opening 34.<br>
A lubricating device 38 and the head thread guide 39 are disposed in the thread path between the blast opening 27 of the guide tube 18 and the traversing device 21.  The lubricating device 38 could comprise, for example, a roller<br><br>
which dips into an oil bath and guides the thread on its surface.<br>
The guide tube 18 has a movable end region 31 which is connected, via a telescopic guide 35, to the fixed parts of the guide tube 18.  Provided on the movable end region 31 of the guide tube 18 is the blast opening 27, which is directed towards the receiving opening of the suction device 25.  Acting on the end region 31 of the guide tube 18 is an actuator 30, by means of which the movable end region 31 of the guide tube 18 can be guided into a transfer position and a feeding position.<br>
For the purpose of initial feeding of the thread and, consequently, for transfer of the thread 36 from the operating side 46 to the winding device 20 on the doffing side 47, the thread 3 6 is guided to the suction opening 33 in the intake region of the heating device 11 by means of a manually guided suction pistol.  The injector 13 of the guide tube 12 and the inj ector 19 of the guide tube 18 are activated.  The thread 36 is sucked into the suction opening 33, following severing at the severing blade 31, and blown out from the blast opening 34.  The loose thread is then deflected at the guide plate 4 4 towards the suction opening 28.  After the guide tube 18 has received the thread through the suction opening 28, the thread 36 is blown through the blast opening 27 to the oppositely disposed receiving opening 2 6 of the suction device 25. This situation is represented in Figure 2.  In this case, the end portion 31 of the guide tube 18 with the blast opening 27 is in the transfer position.  After the thread 36 has been received by the receiving opening 26 of the suction device 25, the transfer of the thread is complete.<br><br>
For the purpose of feeding the thread 36 into the winding station of the winding device 20, the actuator 31 is again activated, so that the blast opening 27 can be guided into the feeding position.  Figure 3 shows the operating state in which the end portion 31 of the guide tube 18 is held in the feeding position, the thread 36 already being wound to form a bobbin.  In the feeding position, the thread is guided in the traversing plane and is ready to be received by the traversing thread guide 37.  The winding operation in the processing station can commence.  Figure 3 shows the processing station during the texturing process, so that the thread 36 is wound up to form the bobbin 48.<br>
The exemplary embodiments of the texturing machine according to the invention that are represented in Figures 1, 2 and 3 are exemplary in respect of the arrangement and design of the processing units.  The simple and rapid initial feeding of the thread in the winding device are essential for the automatic operability of the texturing machine.<br><br>
