The invention relates to new fragrance ingredients, their manufacture and use in fragrance compositions, particularly in fine perfumery and cosmetics compositions.<br>
During their investigations of the low-boiling constituents of Bulgarian rose oil in 1959, C. F. Seidel and M. Stoll {Helv. Chim. Acta 1959, 42,1830) discovered an important trace constituent of green-metallic odor reminiscent of geranium oil and carrot leaves. They termed this new odorant rose oxide and later attributed it the structure 1 (C.F. Seidel, D. Felix, A. Eschenmoser, K. Biemann, E. Palluy, M. Stoll, Helv. Chim. Acta 1961, 44, 598). Though in substance the very powerful, green-metallic odor of rose oxide is rather unpleasant, today it is extensively used in many fragrances to provide diffusivity, lift and naturalness, especially in the top note of perfumes.<br><br>
The methoxy pyrazines 2 and 3 represent another class of very powerful green odorants. 2 was first discovered by R. G. Buttery et al. in green bell pepper oil (R. G. Buttery, R. M. Seifert, R. E. Lundin, D. G. Guadagni, L C. Ling, Chem. Ind. 1969, 490) and later also found in galbanum oil (A. F. Bramwell, J. W. K. Burrell, G. Riezebos, Tetrahedron Lett. 1969, 3215). It is reminiscent of pepperoni, galbanum oil and green peas, and has been introduced into perfumery successfully as Galbazine*. Isohexyl methoxy pyrazine (3) with its more pleasant green, vegetable and hyacinth odor is also frequently used in perfumery, though in very low concentration because of its exceptional strength. Yet, even in high dilutions, all<br><br>
these pyrazines have harsh, unpleasant by-odors, which limit their use in perfumery.<br>
Unfortunately, blending of the aforementioned materials has not led to any interesting odor tonalities without harsh, unpleasant or metallic-burnt aspects being noticeable.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide new ingredients to develop interesting odor tonalities that have proven inaccessible by simple blending of these known compounds.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain 3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrans possess the characteristic odor notes of methoxy pyrazines, but do not exhibit the harsh by-notes that prohibit the extensive use of these pyrazines in perfumery. Facets of rose oxides are also present in these compounds leading to overall interesting, novel odor tonalities.<br>
Therefore, the invention provides in a first aspect a compound of the general formula (I),<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may comprise more than one chiral centre and as such they may exist as a mixture of enantiomers and diastereomers, or they may be resolved as enantiomerically and diastereomerically pure forms, lowever, resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds and so it is preferred to use a compound of formula (I) as a mixture of its stereoisomers simply for economic reasons.<br><br>
However, if it is desired to prepare pure stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to techniques known in the art using commercially-available starting materials, or materials that can be easily prepared from known starting materials. The compounds may be prepared according to a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction using 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene and an appropriately substituted aldehyde, for example butyraldehyde may be employed in the formation of compound (7) in Table 1. Reaction conditions for these Diels-Alder reactions are more fully described in the Examples set forth below. The skilled person will appreciate that other compounds of the present invention may be prepared using an appropriately substituted aldehyde.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of a compound of the general formula (I) or mixtures thereof as a fragrance ingredient wherein,<br><br>
Compounds described hereinabove possess unique, character-donating aspects that makes them suitable for a broad range of possible applications in perfumery. Furthermore, because the compounds do not possess the harsh unpleasant by-notes of the pyrazines exemplified by (2) and (3) above, they may confer a fresh green touch to virtually all kinds of perfume compositions, in virtually all kinds of applications from fine fragrances to cosmetics and detergents, e.g. in shampoos, skin-care products or soaps. Depending on the dosage, the effects can extend from providing more naturalness and character to building up hyacinth or petigrain or other green accords. The use is neither limited to any type of perfume nor to any special olfactory directions, odorants or classes of substances. A few illustrative examples of classes of substances, which aarmonise equally well are:<br>
ethereal oils and extracts, e.g. angelica oil, basilic oil, bergamot oil, carrot seed oil, citrus oils, coriander oil, galbanum oil, geranium oil, jasmin absolute, neroli oil, orris oil, petitgrain oil, rose oil, or violet leaf oil;<br><br>
alcohols, e.g. citronellol, cinnamic alcohol, dihydromyrcenol, Ebano Florol*, geraniol, linalool, Mayol", phenylethyl alcohol or terpineol;<br>
aldehydes and ketones, e.g. decanal, alpha-hexylcinnamaldehyd, hydros citronellal, isoeugenol, Iso E Super', Isoraldeine', Hedione*. methylionor or vanillin;<br>
ether and acetals, e.g. Ambrox', 2-(l-ethoxyethoxy)ethyl benzene, geran] methyl ether, Magnolan', 2-(l-propoxyethoxy)ethyl benzene, or rose oxid (1).<br>
esters and lactones, e.g. benzyl acetate, benzyl salicylate, coumarin, decalactone, ethylene brassylate, Thibetolide", y-undecalactone.<br>
heterocycles, e.g. indol, Galbazine* (2) or 6-/8-isobutylchinoline.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) that are particularly preferred for their fragrano properties are set forth in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Compounds of general formula (I) having R1 and R2 as indicated<br><br><br>
Having regard to compounds in Table 1, compound 4, compound 5 and compound 6 are known compounds, however, the olfactory properties of these compounds have not been previously disclosed.<br>
Compounds according to the formula (I) may be employed in any of the fragrance compositions referred to above in widely varying amounts having regard to the other fragrance ingredients employed and depending on the fragrance accord that a perfumer is trying to achieve. Generally however, one may smploy about 0.01 to 1.0% by weight in fine fragrances and about 0.01 to 10% by weight in other perfumed products.<br>
In addition to their admixture with other fragrance ingredients, the :ompounds of formula (I) may be admixed with one or more excipients :onventionally used in conjunction with fragrances in fragrance compositions, for ixample carrier materials, and other auxiliary agents commonly used in the art uch as solvents, preservatives, colourants and the like. The invention therefore ilso provides<br>
-	a fragrance composition comprising at least one compound as hereinabove defined; and<br>
-	a method of conferring a desired fragrance on a fragrance composition, comprising the blending with known fragrance ingredients and/or excipients of at least one compound as hereinabove defined.<br>

Floral-green perfume oil for fabric softeners:<br><br><br><br><br>
Compound 5 conveys to this perfume freshness and lift, and in particular petigrain-type aspects. It combines very well with the aldehydes, and turns the top note of the fragrance oil more eau de cologne-like; thereby, 5 attenuates the functional aspects of the fragrance and the fabric softener becomes overall more sophisticated, more refined.<br>
Flozal-marine fragrance for soap-.<br><br><br><br><br>
Compound 5 harmoniously combines the hesperidic, floral-marine and green notes of the fragrance; thereby, it rounds off the composition and increases its radiance. In addition, it introduces naturalness and increases the character of that fragrance. At this relatively high dosage, 5 additionally brings in facets of petitgrain oil and jasmone; overall, 5 conveys to the fragrance its unique texture, its fresh and hygienic but also soft and caressing character.<br><br><br><br>
compound 5 conveys to this male fine fragrance essai its fresh facet: a green and nvigorating botanical freshness, clean, clear and compelling. It enriches the lassical top of this modern fougere by new aspects, increases radiance and iffusion, and harmonises and stages the spicy accord of anise, artemisia and utmeg oils. In result, this masculine scent acquires a herbal crispness that does ot disturb the mysterious sensuality of the woody-musky-mossy-coumarine and, but instead accentuates it.<br><br><br>
