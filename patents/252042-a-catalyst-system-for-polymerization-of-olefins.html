Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst system for polymerization of olefins. The invention also relates to a process for polymerization of olefins using the catalyst system and to the polyolefin prepared by the process.<br>
Background<br>
Polymerization of olefins is usually carried out in the presence of a catalyst system containing a Ziegler-Natta type procatalyst carrying internal electron donor(s), an organo aluminium cocatalyst and an external electron donor. Depending upon the kind of internal electron donor used, the polymerization catalyst systems could either be (a) a monoester based catalyst system or (b) a diester based catalyst system.<br>
Monoester based catalyst systems use monoester of aromatic carboxylic acids as internal electron donors. When a monoester based catalyst system is used, the polypropylene productivity is usually low to moderate and polymers having relatively high polydispersity are formed. However, the extent of kinetic control achieved for the polymerization reaction, using such catalyst systems, is high, thus avoiding run away reactions leading to chunk formation. In most cases, monoester based catalyst systems provide polymerization reactions that are self extinguishing in nature i.e polymerization activity reduces with increasing temperature of the reaction.<br>
2<br><br>
Diester based catalyst systems typically use diester of aromatic carboxylic acids as internal electron donor. Polymer productivity using such catalyst systems is relatively high. When diester based catalyst system is used, olefins are usually formed with low to medium polydispersity. It is, however, difficult to achieve adequate kinetic control of the polymerization reaction using such catalyst systems.<br>
Catalyst systems that provide combined advantages of monoester based catalyst systems as well as diester based catalyst systems are highly desired. Use of mixture of external electron donors is known to be advantageous in increasing the productivity of polymerization reactions in monoester based catalyst systems and in controlling the kinetics of polymerization reactions in diester based catalyst systems. US 2007/0032376 discloses a monoester based catalyst system comprising an external donor mixture of paraethoxy ethyl benzoate and a silane compound. The catalyst system comprising the external donor mixture show improved activity as compared to the catalyst system containing paraethoxy ethyl benzoate alone as the external electron donor. However, polydispersity of polypropylene synthesized using the monoester based catalyst system need to be lowered further.<br>
US 2007/0032375 disclose diester based catalyst system wherein a external donor mixture of a silane compound and aromatic carboxylic acid ester is used. Better control is<br>
3<br><br>
achieved in reaction kinetics of the polymerization reaction by the use of the mixture of external electron donors, as compared to the control achieved by the use of a catalyst system having silane alone as the external electron donor. However, there is scope for improvement in the kinetic control achieved using the diester based catalyst systems.<br>

The polymerization is usually carried out under pressure and in the presence of hydrogen.<br>

In the experiments that follow, the productivity of the catalyst system was measured based on the polymer yield and amount of catalyst used. Polydispersity of the polymer resins was measured by GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) instrument PL-GPC-220 at 145°C.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by way of the following non limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1: Comparative study of a monoester based olefin polymerization catalyst system using an external electron donor mixture of para ethoxy ethyl benzoate and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane with that using a external electron donor mixture of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidine, para isopropoxy ethyl benzoate and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane<br>
The polymerization was carried out in the slurry phase using 65 to 70 g of a procatalyst having a composition of 2.8 to 3.4 wt % Ti, 17 to 18 wt % Mg, 14 to 16 wt % of ethyl benzoate (internal donor), 1.2 g of triethyl aluminium co-catalyst (diluted to 10 volume % in n-decane) and a mixture of external electron donors (as listed against experiment 1 and experiment 2 of table 1 and diluted to 5 volume % in n-decane). The procatalyst, the mixture of external donors and the cocatalyst were added along with n-hexane solvent into a preheated moisture-free stainless steel jacketed 3 liter semi batch stirred tank reactor containing a magnetic stirrer. Procatalyst and cocatalyst were added in such amounts as to have a cocatalyst/procatalyst molar ratio of 240 to 260 and a cocatalyst /external donor molar ratio of 3. 240 ml of hydrogen was also added into the reactor under ambient conditions. Propylene gas was introduced into the reactor, the reactor<br>
10<br><br>
pressure was raised to 5.0 to 5.5 kg/cm2 and the reactor temperature was raised to 68-72°C. Polymerization of propylene was carried out in the slurry phase for 1 hour maintaining reactor pressure of 5.0 to 5.5 kg/cm2. After 1 hour of reaction, hexane was removed and polymer was collected/ dried. Productivity of catalyst was calculated based on polymer yield and amount of catalyst used. The amount of catalyst was calculated following titanium estimation method. The polymerization productivity of the monoester catalyst systems in different experiments using different mixtures of external electron donors is given in table-1.<br>

From table 1, it is clear that the catalyst system of experiment 2 using a mixture of external electron donors provide polymer resins having low polydispersity. Further, the productivity of both the catalyst systems are comparable. The observed lowering of<br>
11<br><br>
polydispersity is advantageous. The polyolefin resins having low polydispersity is better suited for various applications.<br>
Example 2: Comparative study of a diester based olefin polymerization catalyst system using an external electron donor mixture of para ethoxy ethyl benzoate and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane with that using a external electron donor mixture of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperdine, para isopropoxy ethyl benzoate and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane.<br>
The polymerization was carried out in the slurry phase using 65 to 70 mg of a procatalyst having a composition of 2.5 to 3.0 wt % Ti, 17 to 18 wt % Mg, 12 to 14 wt % of diisobutyl phthalate (internal electron donor), 1.2 g of triethyl aluminium co-catalyst (diluted to 10 volume % in n-decane)and a mixture of external electron donors. The procatalyst, the cocatalyst and mixture of external electron donors (as listed against experiment 1 and experiment 2 of table 2 and diluted to 5 volume % in n-decane) were added along with n-hexane solvent into a preheated moisture-free stainless steel jacketed semi batch stirred tank reactor containing a magnetic stirrer. Procatalyst and cocatalyst were added in such amounts as to have a cocatalyst/procatalyst molar ratio of 240-260 and a cocatalyst /external donor molar ratio of 3. 240 ml of hydrogen was also added into the reactor at ambient condition. Propylene gas was introduced into the reactor, the reactor pressure was raised to 5.0 to 5.5 kg/cm2 and the reactor temperature was raised to 68-72°C. Polymerization of propylene was carried out in the slurry phase for 1 hour maintaining reactor pressure of 5.0 to 5.5 kg/cm2. After 1 hour of reaction, hexane was removed and polymer was collected/ dried. Productivity of catalyst was calculated based on polymer yield and amount of catalyst used. The amount of catalyst was calculated<br>
12<br><br>
following titanium estimation method. The polymerization activity of the diester based<br>
catalyst systems having two different mixtures of external electron donors is displayed in<br>
table-2.<br>

From table 2, it is clear that the catalyst systems of experiment 2 containing a mixture of external electron donors show lower polymer productivity as compared to the catalyst system of experiment 1. Lower productivity signifies better control over the reaction kinetics that enables to avoid run away reactions. The diester based/ monoester based catalyst system of the invention containing a mixture of external electron donors exhibit enhanced performance in terms of enabling better kinetic control of the polymerization<br>
13<br><br>
reaction and/or providing polyolefins having low polydispersity. The catalyst system of the invention, thus, assists in providing high quality polyolefin resins as well as avoids chunk formation during polymerization. Therefore, the polymerization is improved and waste formation is minimized.<br>
