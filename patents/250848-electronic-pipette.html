				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1]	The present invention is related generally to a pipette for aspirating and for dispensing adjustable volumes of Squid More 8peciflca6y, the present invention relates to a programmable electronic pipette providing multiple modes of operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[2]	In pharmaceutical, genomic, and pnoteornic research, biology research, drug development laboratories, and other biotechnology applications, a liquid pipette is used to handle laboratory samples in a variety of laboratory procedures. Using a pipette, a volume of liquid is aspirated into the pipette. The volume of liquid may then be dispensed in one or more dispensation volume. A piston drive mechanism controls the aspiration and the dispensation of the liquid in specified volumes by imparting motion to a piston assembly. Pipettes in which the piston assembly within the body of the pipette Includes a piston nod controlled by either a motor or directly by the user are known to those skilled in the art Motion of the piston rod is controlled by a thrust exerted by the piston drive mechanism. However, angular displacement of components within the piston drive mechanism may occur relative to the piston assembly. The displacement often causes a small, but measurable longitudinal shift of the piston drive mechanism that in turn causes an inaccurate aspiration or dispensation of the volume of liquid. Thus, what Is needed, is a pipette that eliminates the unwanted longitudinal displacement of the piston drive mechanism components. <br>
[3]	A pipette may operate in a manual mode wherein the user manually controls the speed and the volume of aspiration or of dispensation of the liquid using a pressure sensitive Knob. Alternatively, a pipette may operate in an electronic mode wherein a motor consols the aspiration arid/or dispensation of the liquid. The user may select various parameters including a speed, a volume, a number of aspirations, a number of dispensations, etc. using a user interface. The user interface may include a<br>
numeric keypad that allows the user to enter, for example, the volume. A<br>
i<br>
pipette generally is small and lightwei^it because the desire is for an easily portable device that fits comfortably into a hand of the user and that can be used repetitively with a single hand. As a result, the display and the operational controls must be small making them generally tedious to use. For example, some pipettes may have the small numeric keypad, while the input to other pipettes may be through a set of buttons such as up and down arrow buttons to increase or to decrease a parameter. However, the numeric keypad is difficult to use because each numerical button is small and difficult to select particularly when a user is wearing gloves. Also, use of the keypad buttons generally requires the use of both hands. One hand to support the device and the other hand to precisely select the appropriate numerical button. Additionally, the user may need to successively dispense widely- differing volumes. The up and down arrow buttons require a large number of depressions to reach, for example, the widely-differing volume amount Thus, what is needed is a pipette having an input interface that simplifies the selection of operational parameters for the device and that reduces the time requited to change settings within the device. What is further needed is an input interface that can be operated using a single hand.<br>
[0004] Electronic pipettes typically are controlled by small microprocessors placed within the housing of the pipette. As electronic pipettes have become more sophisticated, additional and more complex operational modes may be provided. For example, an electronic pipette may be configured to aspirate a volume of liquid and dispense the volume in successive dispensation cycles. Additionally, an electronic pipette may be configured to repeatedly aspirate and dispense a volume of liquid thereby<br>
mixing the liquid before the final dispensation of the liquid. To add additional complexity, a sequence of modes may be provided to execute in succession. Again, however, the display and the operational controls are small and tedious to use making it more difficult to "program" the electronic pipette to perform a complex sequence of operations. Thus, what is needed is a pipette that can interface with an external computing device. What is further needed is an application that can be executed on the external computing device to -provide an easy to use interface to the user and to provide instructions to the pipette for operation in a "programmed" mode.<br>

[45]	With reference to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 6 a cross section of the piston drive mechanism 34, the piston assembly 35, the sampling tube 36, and the external lip ejection mechanism 40 mounted tor aspiration and dispensation of liquid by the user is shown. The control rod tip 74 contacts the piston contact plate 90 of the piston assembly 35 within the housing 78 of the piston drive mechanism 34. When dispensing liquid, the piston drive mechanism 34, through displacement of the control rod tip 74 along the longitudinal axis A-A, pushes the piston assembly 35 away from the piston drive mechanism 34 at the point where the control rod tip 74 contacts the piston contact plate 90. The piston return spring 98 compresses against the spring guide 100 held in place by the tube attachment nut 84. When aspirating liquid, the piston drive mechanism 34 moves the control rod tip 74 toward the piston drive mechanism 34. Despite this displacement the piston contact plate 90 remains in contact with the control rod tip 74 as a result of the compressive tome of the piston return spring 98. <br>
[46]	With reference to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 7, the control rod tip 74 has a contact surface 75 that contacts the piston contact plate 90. An angular displacement may result depending on where the contact surface 75 of the control rod tip 74 contacts the piston contact plate 90. With reference to FIG. 7, the ideal alignment of the piston drive mechanism 34 is shown. With reference to FIGs. 8 and 9, an example misalignment of the piston drive mechanism 34 is shown including an angular displacement B and an angular displacement C relative to the ideal alignment along the longitudinal axis A-A. If the contact surface 75 is flat, the angular displacement may effect the precision of the pipette 30 by changing the distance along the longitudinal axis A-A that the control rod 72 extends before contacting the contacting the contact plate 90, and thus, the volume of Squid that is aspirated or dispensed. Using a non-flat surface for the contact surface 75 of the control rod tip 74 maintains the correct distance along the longitudinal axis A-A, thereby reducing inaccuracy in the pipette aspiration or dispensation processing. In an exemplary embodiment, the non-flat surface forms part of sphere whose radius is equal to the maximum distance between the ideal contact point along the longitudinal axis A-A and the maximum expected contact point that may result from angular displacement of the control rod 72. As a result, the piston drive mechanism 34 of the pipette 30 virtually eliminates the unwanted longitudinal displacement of the control rod 72 increasing the accuracy In the volume of liquid aspirated or dispensed.<br>
[0047] The external tip ejection mechanism 40 and the Internal lip ejection mechanism 42 eject the tip 130 from the aspirating and dispensing end of the pipette 30 avoiding possible contamination of samples. The internal tip ejection mechanism 42 includes, but is not limited to, an ejection knob 140, a stationary cylinder 142, a knob cylinder 144, a body cylinder 146, a rod 146, an ejection spring 150, and a mounting brace 152. The stationary cylinder 142 mounts to the body case 32. The mounting brace 152 mounts to the body case 32 and/or the stationary cylinder 142. The stationary cylinder 142 and ti^e mounting brace 152 remain fixed to the body case 32. The ejection knob 140 momts to the knob cylinder 144. The ejection knob 140 may be rotatable about the longitudinal axis A-A thereby accommodating comfortable operation using either a left or a right hand of a user. The knob cylinder 144 slid ably mounts to the stationary cylinder 142 to allow motion of the knob cylinder 144 in combination with depression of the ejection knob 140 to eject the tip 130. The body cylinder 146 mounts to the knob cylinder 144. <br>
The rod 148 mounts to an end of the body cylinder 146 opposite the knob cylinder 144. The ejection spring 150 mounts to the body cylinder 146 at a first end 156 and to the mounting brace 152 at a second end 158. Depression of the ejection knob 140 drives the rod 148 toward the tip 130. The ejection spring 150 causes the rod 148 to return in the opposite direction when the ejection knob 140 is released thereby moving the ejection knob 140 back into the original position. The rod 148 includes a notch 154 at a first end of the rod 148 opposite the body cylinder 146.<br>
[48]	With reference to FIG. 3, the external tip ejection mechanism 40 includes, but is not limited to, an ejection blade 156 and an ejection blade adjustment knob 158. The ejection blade 156 has a curved<br>
shape that follows the external shape of the sampling tube 36. The ejection<br>
i<br>
.blade 156 has a first end .160 and a second end 162. An extension 157 extends from the first end 160 of the ejection blade 156. The extension 157 mounts to the notch 154 of the rod 148 thereby attaching the external tip ejection mechanism 40 to the internal tip ejection mechanism 4Z The second end 162 comprises an enclosed cylinder that slides over the sampling tube 36. As a result, depression of the ejection knob 140 causes motion of the ejection blade 156 along the sampling tube 36 ejecting the tip 130 from the sampling tube 36 with the second end 162. Rotation of the ejection adjustment knob 158 mounted to the ejection blade 156 near the first end 160 causes the second end 162 of the ejection blade 156 to move up or down the sampling tube 36. Adjustment of the ejection blade 156 location along the sampling tube 36 allows the external tip ejection mechanism 40 to eject different size tips.<br>
[49]	With reference to the exemplary embodiment of FIGs. 1,2,16, and 17, the control electronics card 44 includes, but is not limited to, the display 170, a thumb wheel 172, a speed decrease button 174, a speed increase button 176, an inversion button 178, an aspirate/dispense button<br>
180, a left operational mode button 182, a right operational mode button 184, <br>
a reset switch 186, an external power supply connector 188, and a communication interface 190. The control electronics card 44 additionally includes a microprocessor and other associated electronics (not shown) to control motion of the control rod 72 through the actuator 70 of the piston drive mechanism 34.<br>
[50]	The display 170 presents information in a user interface to the user and allows the user to define the operational characteristics of the pipette. The display 170 may be, but is not limited to, a thin film transistor (TFT) display, a light emitting diode (LED) display, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display, etc. With reference to FIGs. 16 and 17, the reset switch 186 may be located on the top of the body case 32 opposite the tip 130 for easy accessibility by the user without interrupting the operation of the pipette 30. The reset switch 186 may allow the user to reset the pipette 30 electronics if the microprocessor enters an unstable state. The external power supply connector 188 also may be located on the top of the body case 32 opposite the tip 130 for easy accessibility by the user without interrupting the operation of the pipette 30.<br>
The external power supply connector 188 may provide charging of the battery<br>
!<br>
120 and/or provide power for operation of, for example, the piston drive mechanism 34 and the control electronics card 44.<br>
[51]	The speed decrease button 174 decreases the speed of the aspiration and/or dispensation of liquid into or out of the sampling tube 36. In an exemplary embodiment, the speed decrease button 174 decreases a pre-set speed setting in a range from one to five. In an alternative embodiment, the speed decrease button 174 directly decreases a speed value. The speed increase button 176 increases the speed of the aspiration and/or dispensation of liquid into or out of the sampling tube 36. In an exemplary embodiment, the speed increase button 176 increases a pre-set speed setting in a range from one to five. In an alternative embodiment, the speed increase button 176 directly increases the speed value.<br>
	Depressing the inversion button 178 causes the operation of the aspirate/dispense button 180 to invert from aspirate to dispense or from dispense to aspirate. In an exemplary embodiment, the inversion button 178 is enabled in only certain operational modes supported by the pipette 30 or during specific programs as defined by the user. Depressing the aspirate/dispense button 180 causes the aspiration, dispensation, and/or purge of liquid in the sampling tube 36. In an exemplary embodiment, successive depressions of the aspirate/dispense button 180 causes different results depending on the operational mode of the pipette 30.<br>
[53]	The left operational mode button 182 and the right operational mode button 184 may be located on either side of the pipette 30 to provide comfortable access by the user using either a left or a right hand. The left operational mode button 182 and the right operational mode button 184 provide the user with one or more operational mode of using the pipette 30. The user selects the desired operational mode through successive depression of either the left operational mode button 182 or the right operational mode button 184 or both. Example operational modes may include, but are not limited to "auto", "auto + mix", "manual", "repetitive", and 'program*. In the "auto* operational mode, for example, the user may define the volume to pipette without a limit to the number aspirations and/or dispensations of liquid. In an exemplary embodiment, simultaneous depression of both the left operational mode button 182 and the right operational mode button 184 may cause the display 170 to present a menu of selectable items. Example menu items and a sequence of display are shown in FIG. 20. The menu items may be displayed'm a read only mode and in a read and write mode in an exemplary embodiment The user may navigate between the plurality of items in the menus and select items to modify in the menu using the thumb wheel 172. Additionally, the user may set the items to various values using the thumb wheel 172.<br>
[54]	In the 'auto + mix" operational mode, for example, the user may define the volume to pipette and the volume of mixing. In the "manual" operational mode, for example, the user may use the pipette 30 like a manual pipette without use of the actuator 70 to control the volume of aspiration/dispensation. The user may aspirate or dispense only a part of a defined volume of liquid allowing aspiration or dispensation in one or more step. In the "repetitive" operational mode, for example, the user may define a volume to dispense. In a next step, the user may define the number of dispensation volumes. For example, using a 100pL pipette, selecfog a dispensation volume of 10pL may allow up to 10 successive dispensations. The entire specffied volume is aspirated after a first depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180 and successive depressions of the aspirate/dispense button 180 cause dispensation of the selected dispensation volume divided by the number of selected dispensation volumes. A subsequent depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180 causes a purge. Anew cycle may be entered after a subsequent depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180. In the "program" operational mode, for example, the user may define a "program" for execution by the microprocessor. The program may be defined using an external computing device and received at the pipette 30 using a communication interface 190 discussed with reference to FIGs. 18-18.<br>
[55]	The thumb wheel 172 enables menu navigation and parameter setting by providing three functions: parameter selection, a parameter increase, and a parameter decrease. Use of the thumb wheel 172 minfoizes the number of buttons on the control electronics card 44 of the pipette 30 by replacing a validation button, an incrementing button, and a decrementing button. With reference to FIGs. 10-12, the thumb wheel 172 includes, but Is not limited to, a disc ring 198, a disc support 200, a disc 202, an electronic circuit board 204, and an axle 206. The disc ring 198 mounts to the disc support 200. The user rotates the disc ring 198 that extends beyond the front case 50 of the body case 32. The disc ring 198 may be formed of a <br>
latex rubber in an exemplary embodiment The disc support 200 mounts to the disc 202. The disc 202 mounts to the axle 206 about which the disc 202 rotates. The axle 206 mounts to the electronic circuit board 204 in a generally perpendicular direction from a first face of the electronic circuit board 204.<br>
[56]	Both transnational motion 210 and rotational motion 212 of the thumb wheel 172 are detected and relayed to the microprocessor of the control electronics card 44 through the electronic circuit board 204. In translational motion, all of the points of the moving body have at any instant the same velocity and direction of motion as opposed to rotational motion. In rotational motion, the body turns about an axis. Rotation in a plane involves rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of rotation. An optical motion encoder detects and converts motion Information into a digital output A quadrature encoder generally may be composed of a light source, an encoded disc, and a fight detector. The encoder modulates a beam of light whose Intensity is sensed by the light detector, producing two signals, A and B as showri with reference to FIG. 13. Signal B lags signal A by 90 degrees. An encoder may measure either translation motion or rotational motion. Both types sense mechanical motion and convert the information (velocity, position, acceleration) into electrical signals that can be used to monitor the motion. The most common encoders are opto-mechanical, in which motion of a mechanical encoding unit such as tie encoded disc, interrupts the optical path between the light source and the light detector. For example, the encoded disc may include one or more slot In the surface of the disc. The light source may be a photodiode. The fight detector may be a photodetector<br>
[57]	The photodetector may be mounted to the electronics board 204, detect motion of the rotating disc 202 and transmit the rotational motion information to the electronic circuit board 204. In an exemplary embodiment, the photodetector is an infrared photodetector. As known to those skilled in the art, other detection means may be integrated with the thumb wheel 172 to detect rotational motion of the disc 202. The disc 202<br>
and the electronic circuit board 204 may be arranged so that the rotation 212 of the disc 202 simultaneously generates the signal A arid the signal B, for example as illustrated in FIG. 13. Each signal may be composed of a period of "two  on (1) and then of Two" off (0). FIG. 14 shows a table of successive values for each signal given a positive rotation of the thumb wheel 172. FIG. 15 shows a table of successive values for each signal given a negative notation of the thumb wheel 172. Thus, given a previous value for each signal A and B and a current value for each signal A and B( the rotation direction of the thumb wheel 172 may be determined through comparison with the tables of FIG. 14 and FIG. 15. Thus, a previous signal A value of 1 and a previous signal B value of 1 and a current signal A value of 0 and a current signal B value of 1 indicates a positive rotation of the thumb wheel 172. Conversely, a previous signal A value of 1 and a previous signal B value of 1 and a current signal A value of 1 and a current signal B value of 0 indicates a negative rotation of the thumb wheel 172. Thus, the thumb wheel 172 may include an encoder that uses quadrature encoding.<br>
[58]	A motion detector may be mounted to the electronic circuit board 204 to detect a translations! motion 210 of the disc 202 produced when the user depresses the thumb wheel 172. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the motion detector may include a spring 208 that mounts to the axle 206 and causes the disc 202 to return to its original position after the user releases the thumb wheel 172. Movement of the spring 208 may create an Impulse" that is detected at the electronic circuit board 204. As known to those skilled in the art, other detection means may be integrated with the thumb wheel 172 to detect translational motion of the disc 202.<br>
[59]	The pipette 30 may measure the rotational speed of the rotating disc 202 when It is moved by the user. The rotating disc 202 may be divided into a predetermined number of sections that correspond to an angular measure of the wheel For example, four sections correspond to an angular measure of 90 degrees. Six sections correspond to an angular measure of 60 degrees. The number of section crossings by the rotating disc 202 while It is rotated by the user are counted. While rotating the rotating disc 202, the user may "feel" each section crossing. The microprocessor measures the period of time lor the rotating disc 202 to complete some rotation distance thereby calculating a speed of rotation. For example, the time to complete two successive rotations may be used to calculate the speed of rotation. Based on the period of time measured, the microprocessor may change an increment size for a parameter currently being modified by the user. For example, if the period is less than fifteen milliseconds, the microprocessor may increment the parameter by 100. If the period is greater than fifteen milliseconds but less than twenty-live milliseconds, the microprocessor may increment the parameter by 10. If the period is greater than twenty-five milliseconds, the microprocessor may increment the parameter by 10. Thus, the faster the user rotates the thumb wheel 172, the faster the parameter being set by the user increases or decreases. Conversely, if the rotation of the thumb wheel 172 is slow, the microprocessor commands a slower variation of the parameter. The increment values and Ihreshoids for changing the increment values may be modified.<br>

f0061] As shown with reference to FIG. 18, a system 220 may include, but is not limited to, the pipette 30 and a computing device 230. The communication interface 190 allows the pipette 30 to communicate with the computing device 230. The computing device 230 may be a computer of any form factor including desktop, laptop, personal data a	The<br>
computing device 230 is physically distinct from the pipette 30. The communication interface 190 may be located on the top of the body case 32 opposite the tip 130 for easy accessibility by the user without interrupting the operation of the pipette 30 as shown with reference to FIGs. 16 and 17. Communication between the pipette 30 and the computing device 230 may use various transmission technologies including, but not Unrated to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Short Messaging Seivioe (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), e-mail, Instant Messaging Service (IMS), Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, etc. The pipette 30 and the computing device 230 may communicate using various media including, but riot limited to, radio, infrared, laser, cable connection, efac.<br>
Thus, the communication interface 190 may utilize a wired connection 192 and/or a wireless connection 194.<br>
[62]	The wired connection 192 may include a first end that connects with the communication interface 190 of the pipette 30 and a second end that oonnects with a communication interface 234 of the computing device 230. In an exemplary embodiment the communication interlace 190 of the pipette 30 meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 mini standards, in an exemplary embodiment the communication interface 234 of the computing device 230 may be of type RS 232 that is designed to accept a Universal Serial Bus connector. In an alternative embodiment the communication interface 190 of the pipette 30 and/or the communication interface 23^ of the computing devioe 230 may be an Ethernet interface.<br>
[63]	Wireless communication interfaces may connect devices over various distances from short to long. The pipette 30 and the computing device 230 may support processing for broadcasting and receiving a wireless signal. The wireless signals may, for example, use the IEEE 802.11 ™ standard, using either version 802.11 a, 802.11 b, 802.11 f or 802.11 g. Additionally, the wireless signals may, for example, use the BLUETOOTH standard of which IEEE 802.15.1 is the most recent version. The IEEE 802.11 ™ specifications define wireless standards for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) that provide an "over-the-air" interface between a wireless client and a base station or access point, as well as among other wireless clients. The IEEE 802.15 Working Group provides standards for low-complexity and low-power consumption Wireless Personal Area Networks (PANs) such as those supported by the Bluetooth specification.<br>
[64]	With reference to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 19, the computing device 230 may Include, but is not limited to, a display 232, the communication interface 234, an input interface 236, a memory 238, a <br>
processor 240, and a pipetting module 242, The display 232 presents information to the user of the computing device 230 and allows the user to define the operational characteristics of the pipette 30 using the larger display and input interface 236 of the computing device 230 instead of those provided at control electronics card 44. The display 232 may be, but is not limited to, a TFT display, an LED display, an LCD, a CRT display, etc. The input interface 236 provides an interface for receiving information from the user for entry into the computing device 230. The input interface 236 may use various input technologies including, but not limited to, a keyboard, a pen and touch screen, a mouse, a track bail, a touch screen, a keypad, one or more buttons, etc. to allow the user to enter information into the computing device 230 or to make selections. The input interface 236 may provide both an input and output interface. For example, a touch screen both allows user input and presents output to the user.<br>
10065] The memory 238 may be the electronic holding place for an operating system of the computing device 230 and/or the pipetting module 242 so that the information can be reached quickly by the processor 240. The computing device 230 may have a plurality of memories 238 using different memory technologies including, but not limited to, Random Acoess Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, etc,<br>
[0066] The processor 240 executes instructions that cause the computing device 230 to perform various functions. The instructions may be written using one or more programming language, scripting language, assembly language, etc. Additionally, the instructions may be carried out by a special purpose computer, logic circuits, or hardware circuits. Thus, the processor 240 may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination of these methods. The term "execution" refers to the process of running an application, program, or module or the carrying out of the operation called for by an instruction. The processor 240 executes a module meaning that it performs the operations called for by that module in the form <br>
of a series of instructions. The processor 240 may retrieve an application from a non-volatile memory that is generally some form of ROM or Hash memory and may copy the instructions in an executable form to a temporary memory that is generally some form of RAM. The processor 240 may execute instructions embodied, for example, in the pipetting module 242. The computing device 200 may include one or more processor 240.<br>
[67]	The pipetting module 242 is an organized set of instructions that, when executed, allow the user to create a program for execution by the pipette 30. The program defines operations for the pipette 30 to perform. The pipetting module 242 may be written using one or more programming language, assembly language, scripting language, etc. The term 'execution" is the process of carrying out the instructions called for by the pipetting module 242. For the pipetting module 242 to execute, the application may be translated Into a machine language that the computing device 230 understands. Launching the pipetting module 242 generally entails retrieving the pipetting module 242 in an executable form from a -permanent memory device and copying the executable to a temporary memory device, generally some form of RAM. The permanent memory device may be, but is not limited to, a hard disk, a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, etc.<br>
[68]	The pipette 30 may transmit and receive Information from the computing device 230. Selection of the operational mode "program" causes the pipette 30 to execute a program module defined by the user on the computing device 230 using the pipetting module 242 and transmitted to the pipette 30 through the communication interface 234. The pipetting module 242 transmits the program module to the pipette 30 using the communication interface 234. The pipette 30 receives the program module using the communication interface 190. The program module includes the operations to be executed by the microprocessor of the pipette 30 after the user places the pipette 30 in the "program" operational mode. For example, the program module may be a table of instructions to the pipette 30. As another alternative, the program module may include a word or letter followed by a parameter value. A communication language may be developed for defining the operations to be executed by the pipette 30. The communication language may be similar to those that employ tags such as the hypertext markup language or fie extensible markup language. To execute the program module that comprises the operational instructions to the pipette, the pipette 30 is placed into the program mode using the left operational mode button 182 or the right operational mode button 184.<br>
[0069] The pipetting module 242 of the computing device 230 allows the user to easiy create complex pipetting operations using the display 232 and the Input interface 236 of the computing device 230 instead of the interface components of the pipette 30 described with reference to FIGs: 1,2, and 10. For example, the pipetting module 242 provides functions that include, but are not limited to:<br>
" storing pipette data that indicates the pipette type, for exampie, monocanai pipette, eight- or twelve- canal pipette, nominal pipette volume, etc.,<br>

*	calibration data relative to the target volume and the volume actually measured, and<br>
*	calibration parameters including a volume measured at a minimum volume, a volume measured at a 50% of maximum volume, and a volume measured at a 100% of maximum volume. <br>
Defining user programs for execution by the pipette in the operational mode "program". The user may define a custom program by selecting and organizing elementary tasks to create a program module that is communicated to the pipette 30 through the communication interlace 190. The user defines the custom program using computing device 230. These tasks, in general, have customization parameters. Example tasks and customization parameters are defined below.<br>
*	Air aspiration. A sequence of air intake volumes through the pipette 30 are defined. During this procedure, the pipetting module 242 displays on display 232 a name, a value of the volume of air to aspirate, and a speed of aspiration. In an exemplary embodiment, the user may specify a speed from among a predetermined number of available speeds defined by default for the pipette 30. For example, five speeds may be defined by default The name may be defined by the user to describe the task and may, for example, have a maximum length of fifteen characters. By default, the name of the task may be "air aspiration" or "air gap".<br>
*	Alarm. A number of beeps may be emitted by a sound generator of the pipette 30 even if the sound generator is deactivated by the user to notify the user of a specific point in the operation. For example, two beeps with an interval of about 500 milliseconds may be emitted.<br>
*	Aspiration. The user may specify the following parameters: the volume to be aspirated, the speed of aspiration for this volume, and the name of the task. By default, the name of the task may be "aspiration* or "aspirate".<br>
Dilution. The user may specify the following parameters: the volume of aspirated air or the air gap between each liquid sample, the volume of each liquid to aspirate, the aspiration speed of each liquid, a name of each of the two to five liquids intended to be displayed in the display 170 of the pipette 30, and the name of the task. In the absence of the name of each of the two to five liquids, the aspiration volume may be displayed. Dispensation. The user may specify the following parameters: the volume to be dispensed, the speed of dispensation for this volume, and the name of the task. By default, the name of the task may be 'dispensation" or "dispense".<br>
Manual. Using the "aspiration" and "dispensation" tasks, depressing the aspirate/dispense button 180 aspirates or dispenses the full volume. Using the manual task, aspiration or dispensation occur only when pressure on the aspirate/dispense button 180 is maintained by the user. Aspiration or dispensation of the defined volume can therefore take place in several steps. A name of the task may be defined that is displayed in the display 170 of the pipette. Several types of manual tasks may be defined:<br>
*	Manual mode type in which the volume of liquid and the speed of aspiration are defined and use of the inversion button 178 allows a change in direction of operation.<br>
#	Manual aspiration-only type in which the aspiration volume, the speed of aspiration, and the speed of dispensation are defined and use of the inversion button 178 allows the procedure to be terminated. <br>
• Manual dispensation -only type in which the dispensation volume and the speed of dispensation are defined and use of the inversion button 178 allows the procedure to be terminated. Mix. A mixing procedure involves a liquid that is aspirated and dispensed a predetermined number of times to mix the sample. The user may specify the following parameters: a mixture volume, a speed of aspiration, a speed of dispensation, a number of mixing cycles to be executed, for example, between 1 and 99 inclusive, and the name of the task. By default, the name of the task may be "mix" or "mbdng*. After the number of cycles is executed, the pipette 30 warts for the aspirate/dispense button 180 to be released to stop the mixing cycle.<br>
Normal. Selection of the normal task sends an instruction to the pipette 30 to switch from a programmed task to a standard pipetting mode after user depression of the inversion button 178.<br>
Pause. Selection of a pause task stops the progress of a mode or the programmed task for a time defined by the user. The user may specify the following parameters: the time and the name of the task. The time may, for example, be definable between 0 and 999.9 seconds with an increment of 0.1 seconds. Purge. Selection of a purge task causes motion of the piston to insure that all of the liquid is removed from the sampling tube 36. The user may specify the name of the task. There may be multiple types of purge. Repeat aspirations. The task executes a predetermined number of aspirations with each aspiration having an <br>
aspiration volume and a speed of aspiration. After each aspiration, a pause may be defined for either a period of time or until the aspirate/dispense button 180 is depressed. The user may specify the following parameters: a number of aspirations, a volume to be aspirated for each aspiration, a speed of aspiration for each volume to be aspirated, a name for each volume to be aspirated, a type of pause that follows the aspiration of each volume, and the name of the task. Repeat Dispensations. The task executes a predetermined number of dispensations with each dispensation having a dispensation volume and a speed of dispensation. After each dispensation, a pause may be defined for either a period of time or until the aspirate/dispense button 180 is depressed. The user may specify the following parameters: a number of dispensations, a volume to be dispensed for each dispensation, a speed of dispensation for each volume to be dispensed, a name for each volume to be dispensed, a type of pause that fbflows the dispensation of each volume, and the name of the task. Reverse. Selection of the reverse task inverts the operation of the pipette. During normal operation, aspiration of the liquid occurs until the desired volume is aspirated, dispensation of the liquid causes expulsion of this volume followed by an additional purge to insure that ail of the liquid is dispnsed. Conversely, in the reverse mode, the desired volume and an additional volume are aspirated. Without stopping, the aspiration is followed by a dispensation of half of the additional volume. Depressing the aspirate/dispense button 180 again <br>
causes the dispensation of a quantity of liquid equal to the desired volume without dispensing the additional half Of the additional volume remaining in the sampling tube 36. The remaining additional volume is dispensed during the purge.<br>
• Wait Selection of a wait task stops the progress of a task for the entire time that the user depresses the aspirate/dispense button 160 or for the entire time unto the user depresses the aspirate/dispense button 180. integrating new modes into the pipette 30. Calibrating the pipette by the user. The user measures volumes effectively removed by providing three target volumes for the pipette 30, for example, a minimum volume, a volume at 50% of a maximum volume, and a volume at 100% of the maximum volume. The pipette may self-calibrate after the user transmits the value of the volumes measured for the respective samplings by the pipette 30. The pipetting module 242 executes one or more equations corresponding to the respective volumes. While the pipette 30 is in use, each equation allows the microprocessor of the pipette 30 to calculate a connected value for the volume. The corrected value is displayed in the display 170 while the pipette is in use by the user. In fact, manual adjustment of the value to be aspirated involves transmission of a raw value to the microprocessor that applies the corresponding equation or matrix to obtain the corrected value. Calibrating using a single-point The user may calibrate the pipette 30 using a volume that the user frequently uses. The user specifies the volume and executes the aspiration and dispensation. The pipette 30 may self-calibrate in the manner related above. <br>
• Maintaining service information. The following parameters may be read from the pipette 30: a last servicing date, a total number of samplings executed, a number of pipette operations since the last servicing, a volume Isnlt value, if a volume limit lower than the nominal ppette volume has been defined, values used for calibration, and values used for single-point calibration. The following parameters may be written to the pipette 30: a next". servicing date, the volume limft value, the values used for calibration, and the values used for single-point calibration.<br>
[70]	In alternative embodiments, additional, fewer, or different operations may be definable using the pipetting module 242. For example, when specifying the "auto" operational mode in the program module, the user may additionally select among various aspirate/dispense/purge options. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the user may select from three aspirate/dispensa/purge options, in a first option, the pipette stops after dispensing the liquid and before purging, in a second option, the pipette dispenses the liquid and purges without stopping. In a third option, the pipette Is operated in a classic manner wherein liquid is aspirated alter a first depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180, liquid is dispensed after a second depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180 without releasing the aspirate/dispense button 180, and liquid is purged after a release of the aspirate/dispense button 180 and a third depression of the aspirate/dispense button 180.<br>
