FEMININE SANITARY PROTECTION PACKAGING<br>
ARTICLE AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
absorbing or containing menstrvial fluids and other body exudates .  More specifically, this inven t, ion relates to nc;vp ]<br>
feminine sanitary protection parkaginq which provides fu1 I and complete sanitary protection, ease   in handli ng, convenience and discretion in packaging appearance.<br>
Background of  the invention<br>
Absorbent articles such as   sanitary napkins are designed to absorb body fluids, including menses, and may come in different functional designs as grouped into categories-  In one category, sanitary napkins are externally worn about the pudendal area and are designed primarily for heavy flow. Secondly, panty liners or panty shields are thin products externally worn about the pudendal area and arc developed for light flow.  Thirdly, tampons are designed to be positioned internally within the vagina-<br><br>
I 
i<br>
T<br>
r 1 ( <br><br>
In addition to concerns of sanitary napkin movement and wearer discomfort, a concern of high degree of wearing awareness may be present.  Some thick sanitary napkins have a high profile appearance when viewed through a wearer's outer garments.  The sanitary napkins can be very apparent when worn with tight fitting clothing including slacks, body suits, swimming suits, or similarly thin or close fitting outer garments.<br>
Panty liners or panty shields, as viewed as a second category of functional designs for feminine sanitary protection, have been developed for light or low menstrual flows. Some panty liners or panty shields have the same concerns associated with sanitary napkins although their thin profiles make them more flexible, less obtrusive in appearance, and generally more comfortable than the bulky sanitary napkins. However, the thin-profile panty liners or panty shields can have a drawback in the performance area of absorptive capacity.<br>
Tampons, as viewed as a third category of feminine care devices, are worn internally within the vaginal canal to intercept body fluid.  Sometimes tampons may not function completely to prevent leakage because radial expansion of the tampon within the vaginal canal does not form a perfect seal. Yet without such radial expansion and swelling of the tampon within the vaginal canal, the tampon does not serve as a completely reliable sanitary protection device.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,383,868, issued to Hyun, discloses a sanitary napkin for absorbing and collecting a woman's men-, strual liquids.  An absorbent pad is positioned against the woman's abdomen and the skin area between the thighs so as to overlie the vaginal opening.  A porous absorbent plug extends from one   face of the pad so as to be inserted into the woman's vagina.  Menstrual blood and associated secretions flow through the porous plug into the pad for collection and safe retention-  The Hyun sanitary napkin does not provide a porta-<br><br>
ble and disposable means of carrying vaginal absorbents or suppositories with a panty liner.  The Hyun sanitary napkin further does not allow for a woman to use an applicator and then dispose of it conveniently.<br>
U.S. Patent No, 5,579,916, issued to Manko, discloses a kit or case with hinged sections for carrying feminine hygiene materials.  The case is made of a washable material such as canvas or vinyl and is closed by a zipper.  The Manko kit suffers from the drawbacks of a lack of disposability and a lack of a preferred level of discretion.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,046,620, issued to Barabino, discloses a re-usable method of storing and removal of personal hygiene products ranging from tampons to cosmetics, similar to a pocketbook or purse.  The Barabino purse kit suffers from the drawbacks of a lack of disposability and reusability and doe^ not include tampon applicators with absorbents or suppositories and liners.  The Barabino purse only provides a storage container.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,425,130, issued to DesMarais, discloses a compound sanitary napkin having a primary menstrual pad and a panty protector.  The DesMarais primary menstrual pad and panty protector are joined at their corresponding ends.  The DesMarais compound sanitary napkin does not provide a separate, loose device in each package.<br>
A new feminine sanitary protection package is needed which provides full and complete sanitary protection, ease in handling, convenience, and discretion in packaging appearance.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an absorbent article feminine sanitary protection to absorb or contain menstrual fluids and other body exudates, including urine.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide feminine sanitary protection, which is comfortable, physically and psychologically to the user, to wear and to handle.<br><br>
still another object of the present invention is to provide feminine sanitary protection, which is capable of absorbing significant amounts of menses and other body exudates, while providing enhanced wearer comfort and a low profile of appearance when viewed through a wearer's outer garments .<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide feminine sanitary protection which is capable of absorbing significant amounts of body fluid while providing enhanced protection against leakage through to a wearer's outer garments•<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide feminine sanitary protection which provides full and complete sanitary protection, efficiencies in material and manufacturing costs, ease in consumer handling, convenience, and discretion in packaging appearance.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS     I<br>
NoW, a novel feminine sanitary protection packaging and method have been developed which provide full and complete sanitaty protection, efficiencies in material and manufactur-^ ing costs, ease in consumer handling, convenience, and discretion in packaging appearance.<br>
The feminine sanitary protection packaging of the present invention provides a sanitary napkin or panty liner or shield combined around one or more vaginal inserts or vaginal insert applicators containing absorbents or medical devices for easy handling and use and easy disposal.  In one aspect, the sanitary napkin or panty liner or shield is laterally rolled around a tampon.  In one aspect, the sanitary napkin or panty liner or shield is laterally rolled around a medical device such as a medicinal suppository.  In one  aspect, an ultrathin pad or panty liner or shield is longitudinally C-wrapped around a tampon.  In one aspect, the ultrathin pad or panty liner or shield is longitudinally C-wrapped around a medical device such as a medicinal suppository.<br>
By sanitary napkin, it is meant an ultrathin pad or a maxipad as described in detail herein below.<br>
By vaginal insertion device, it is meant a vaginal insert or vaginal insert applicator.  By vaginal insert, it is meant a tampon or vaginal medicine insert such as a vaginal suppository.  By vaginal insert applicator, it is meant a tampon applicator or a vaginal medicine insert applicator such as a vaginal suppository applicator.<br><br>
The novel sanitary protection package fills a woman's need to have an absorbent pad or panty liner or shield readily accessible when using absorbent substances such as tampons or vaginal suppositories, e.g., such as for yeast infections.  At the same time, the sanitary protection package of the present invention minimizes the use of superfluous materials, e.g., such as peel strip, extra packaging pouch, and the like.<br>
The novel feminine sanitary protection packaging article and method provide a an absorbent pad or panty liner or shield laterally rolled or longitudinally C-wrapped around a separate plastic or paper applicator which contains substances such as absorbents, for menstrual use, or medications, e.g., such as for vaginal infections.  The absorbent pad or panty liner or shield might also be laterally rolled or longitudinally C-wrapped directly around a device without an applicator.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention includes a pouch component and the combination of an absorbent pad or a panty liner or shield partially surrounding one or more applicators containing ab.sorbents or medical devices.  The combination of the an absorbent pad or panty liner or shield around separate applicators containing absorbents or medical devices in one pouch provides a more discreet, convenient, and portable option than carrying the devices separately.  The pouch, made with either biodegradable or non-biodegradable materials, serves to protect the adhesive element prior to wear and acts as a packaging agent for both products.<br>
Sanitary napkins, also referred to as catamenial or feminine pads, and panty liners are described in Serbiak et al., U.S. No. Patent 5,248,309; DiPalma et al., U.S. Patent No.  5,649,916; and DiPalma et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,609,588, which are hereby incorporated by reference and included herein as if they were repeated verbatim.<br>
Sanitary napkins, also referred to as catamenial or feminine pads, are designed to be worn by a female to absorb medium to heavy flow of body fluids such as menses, blood,<br><br>
urine, and other excrements discharged by the body during a menstrual period.  Sanitary napkins are external devices which are designed to be aligned approximate the pudendum region of the human body and are generally held in position by being adhesively or mechanically attached to an undergarment.  Such products differ from tampons which are classified as internal devices and are designed to be physically inserted into the vaginal cavity.<br>
Sanitary napkins include ultrathins and maxipads and differ from panty liners and panty shields in several noticeable ways.  Sanitary napkins are generally larger in size, have a more defined three-dimensional configuration, are thicker in caliper, and are bulkier in appearance than panty liners or panty shields.<br>
Functionally, sanitary napkins are different in that they are constructed to absorb a greater quantity of body fluid and are designed so that they can be worn for a longer period of time, for example, overnight, if needed.<br>
Since sanitary napkins normally are used during the major discharge portion of a menstrual period, they are constructed to handle medium to heavy flows and commonly have a total absorbent capacity in the range of about 20 to 50 grams of fluid.  Panty liners and panty shields, on the other hand, are designed to absorb relatively small amounts of body fluids and are marketed to be used at the beginning and end of a menstrual period when flow is light or spotty.  Commercially available panty liners and panty shields are constructed to have a total absorbent capacity in the range of about 1 to 15 grams of fluid.<br>
Panty liners or panty shields have a caliper of about 0.1 to 4 mm, as indicated in Table I.  Ultrathin pads have a caliper of about 3-5 mm,  Maxipads have a caliper of about 6 mm and higher.  See Table I.<br><br><br>
Absorbent Capacity Testing Method<br>
The absorbent capacity of the sanitary napkin can be stermined by the following test.  In performing this test, he napkin is sufficient.  The sanitary napkin to be tested irst is conditioned by leaving it in a room which is at l + lC and at 50±2% relative humidity for a period of two Durs.  If the napkin contains a peel strip, this is removed. he  entire napkin, minus any peel strip, is weighed to the earest 0.1 gram.  The napkin is then submerged in a beaker of tabilized isotonic saline which contains no preservatives.  A uitable sterile saline is commercially sold by Baxter Traven f Company of Deerfield, 111. under catalog no. B3158-2,  The apkin is submerged totally and is not bent or otherwise wisted or folded.  The napkin is submerged for 10 minutes, he napkin is removed from the saline and suspended for two inutes in a vertical position to allow the saline to drain ut of the napkin.  The napkin then is placed with the body-ide cover face down on an absorbent blotter.  The blotter can e filter paper no. ED 631 -25 available from the Ahlstrom iltration Inc., Mount Holly Springs, Pa. 17065.  A uniform 7.6 grams per square centimeter load is placed over the apkin to squeeze out excess fluid.  The absorbent blotter is eplaced every 30 seconds until the amount of fluid trans-erred to the absorbent blotter is less than 0.5 grams in a 30 econd period.  Next, the napkin is weighed to the nearest 0,1 ram, and the dry weight of the napkin is subtracted.  The ifference in grams is the capacity of the napkin.<br><br>
The novel sanitary protection package combination of the present invention provides efficiencies in material and manufacturing costs and ease in consumer handling.<br>
An advantage for such a packaging combination is that it conveniently contains all the products a women needs to feel fresh and completely protected, i.e., 100% protected, from stains on her undergarments or adjacent clothing.  The novel sanitary protection package combination of the present invention provides women with an almost zero chance of experiencing staining on their undergarments when using these products together.<br>
The product is more discreet and convenient than carrying two separate devices.  A woman does not need to go out and buy two separate products, thereby saving money and time.  Nor does she need to carry them around separately, and make sure when it comes time to use them that both separate packages still are available.<br>
The packaging keeps them both fresh and protected from contamination.<br>
In one aspect, the invention eliminates the need for a release strip on the adhesive-backed product since a sheet backing protects the adhesive element.  The sheet also serves as a pouch which can be sealed together to enclose the combination panty liner and vaginal insert or insert applicator.<br>
The novel feminine sanitary protection combination packaging provide a convenience of a discreet, convenient,  portable system for carrying externally worn absorbent pads when using absorbent substances such as tampons or vaginal suppositories or vaginal creams, e.g., such as for yeast infections.<br>
The pouch component of the present invention provides an individual pouch for transporting the combination of sanitary napkin or panty liner or shield laterally rolled or longitudinally C-wrapped around separate applicators containing absorbents or medical devices.  The pouch keeps the combination package clean when kept and carried in a woman's purse and<br><br>
when it has been stored in the purse for awhile.  The pouch component keeps the combination package sanitary in a purse, briefcase, backpack, car, or in a drawer.<br>
The pouch component provides an individual pouch for disposing of the combination of the sanitary napkin or panty liner or panty shield and vaginal insert or insert applicator.<br>
For attractive appearance, the individual pouch preferably is composed of a plastic material such as polyethylene or polypropylene, but may be composed of other materials, e.g.,. such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polycaporolactone (PCL), paper, or a nonwoven material, e.g., such as spunbond/meltblown.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, similar components in all of the drawings are referenced using the same identifying numerals.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1-3, a sanitary protection device 10 includes a combination of a panty shield 12 and a tampon 14.  The panty shield 12 has an hour glass shape, but may have an oval, straight, or race track shape, having a first end 16, a second end 17, and a middle 18.  The panty shield 12 has a central longitudinal axis X-X.  The tampon 14 is shown placed in a position near the middle 18 and is positioned transverse to the length of the device 10 and transverse to the longitudinal axis X-X of the panty shield 12. The combination of the panty shield 12 and the tampon 14 are rolled up by placing the tampon 14 near one end, i.e., either first end 16 or second end 17, and rolling the panty shield 12 laterally beginning with that end where the vaginal insert device of the tampon 14 is placed for rolling, to form a rolled combination 20.  The rolled combination 20 is rolled in such a manner that a release strip backing 22 of the panty shield 12 is showing on the exterior of the rolled combination 20.  The rolled combination 20 in the case  of a panty liner and tampon combination typically will place the panty liner wrapped around the tampon to the extent of 720 degrees, by way<br><br>
of example.  The rolled combination 20 is placed in a package 2 4 having a closed or sealed end 2 6,  The package 2 4 can then be closed off at an opposite end 28.  The package 24 can be closed at both ends 2 6 and 28 by ultrasonic sealing, heat sealing, adhesive, or embossing.<br>
Referring now to Figures 4-6, a sanitary protection device 210 includes a combination of a panty liner 12 and a tampon 14.  The panty liner 12 has an hour glass shape, but may have an oval, straight, or race track shape.  The panty liner 12 has a first end 16, a second end 17, a middle section 18, a first side 19, and a second side 21.  The panty liner 12 has a central longitudinal axis X-X.

The liquid-permeable cover 90 can also be formed from either natural or synthetic fibers.  Suitable materials include bonded carded webs of polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, or other heat-bondable fibers.  Other polyolefins/ 'such as copolymers of polypropylene and polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, finely-perforated film webs and net materials, also work well.  A preferred material is a composite of an apertured thermoplastic film positioned above a lion-waveh fabric material.  Such a composite material can be forittea by extrusion of a polymer onto a web of spunbond material to form an integral sheet.  One example of this material is an apertured, thermoplastic polyethylene film bonded to a Spunbond material.  Spunbond material is a non-woven material which is manufactured and commercially sold by Kimberly-Clark Corporation having an office located at 401 N. Lake Street/ Neenah, Wisconsin 54956.  The apertured film/non-woven laminate exhibits a smooth appearance and is soft to the touch. This material is soft and does not irritate the wearer's skin and yet has a cushioned feel because of its bulk.  Another material useful as the liquid-permeable cover 90 is a spunfeond web of polypropylene.  This spunbond web can contain from between about 1 percent to about 6 percent of a whitening agent, such as titanium dioxide (Ti02) or calcium carbonate (CaCOj to give it a clean, white appearance.  A uniform thickness of spunbond is desirable because it will have sufficient strength, after being perforated, to resist being torn or pulled apart during use.  The most preferred polypropylene webs have a basis weight of between about 18 grams per square meter (q/m2) to about 40 g/m2.  An optimum weight is between about 30 g/m2 to about 40 q/m2.<br><br>
The absorbent layer 92 can be present as a single layer or as two or more distinct layers.  The absorbent layer 92 can be formed from various natural or synthetic fibers such as wood pulp fibers, virgin cellulose fibers, regenerated cellulose fibers, cotton fibers, peat moss, or a blend of pulp and other fibers.  The absorbent layer 92 also could be formed from a fine pore fabric such as wet-laid, air-dried tissue or from an uncreped through air-dried (UCTAD) tissue having a basis weight of from about 30 g/m2 to about 120 g/m2.  The UCTAD tissue can be prepared by a process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,048,589 issued to Crook et al. on September 17, 1991.  The UCTAD tissue is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,399,412 issued to Sudall et al. on March 21, 1995.  Each of these patents is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.  The absorbent layer 92 also may be comprised of other Well-known materials such as cellulose fibers, rayon fibers, cellulose sponge, hydrophilic synthetic sponge, for example polyurethane, and the like.<br>
The liquid-impermeable baffle 94 is designed to permit the passage of air or vapor out of the absorbent articles 12 and 52 while blocking the passage of body fluid.  The liquid-impermeable baffle 94 can be made from any material having these properties.  The baffle 94 also can be constructed from a material that will block the passage of vapor as well as fluids, if desired.  A good material from which the liquid-impermeable baffle 94 can be constructed is a micro-embossed, polymeric film, such as polyethylene or polypropylene.  Bi-component films can also be used.  A preferred material is polyethylene film.  Most preferably, the polyethylene film will have a thickness in the range of from about 0.5 mm to about 2.0 mm.<br>
It should be noted that construction adhesive can be used in the product to attach and bond the various layers together. For example, construction adhesive can be used to bond the liquid-impermeable baffle 94 to the absorbent 92 or to bond<br><br>
the absorbent 92 to the liquid-permeable cover 90.  The presence of such construction adhesive and the amount used will depend upon manufacturing specifications.  Useful construction edhesives are commercially sold by National Starch and Chemi-cal Company, having an office located at 10 Finderne Ave., Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807,<br>
The absorbent articles 12 and 52 also include one or more elongated strips or areas of garment attachment adhesive 96 secured to the bottom surface of the liquid-permeable baffle 94.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 functions to attach the absorbent articles 12 and 52 to the inner crotch portion of an undergarment during use.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 enables the sanitary napkin or panty liner to be properly aligned and retained relative to the user's vaginal opening so that maximum fluid protection can be obtained.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 can cover the complete bottom surface of the liquid-impermeable baffle 94 or only a portion of it.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 can consist of a swirl pattern of adhesive or be one or more strips of adhe-sive.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 also can consist of a plurality of adhesive dots which are randomly or uniformly arranged on the exterior surface of the baffle 94.  When in strip form, the garment attachment adhesive 96 can be aligned along the central longitudinal axis X-X of the absorbent articles 12 and 52.  Alternatively, the garment attachment adhesive 96 can be present as two or more spaced apart longitudinal strips.  The garment attachment adhesive 96 is of such a nature that it will allow the user to remove the absorbent article 12 or 52 and reposition it on her undergarment if needed.  A hot melt adhesive which works well as the garment attachment adhesive is commercially sold by National Starch and Chemical Company having an office located at 10 Finderne Avenue, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807,<br>
In order to protect the garment attachment adhesive 96 from contamination prior to use, the adhesive 96 can be pro-<br><br>
tected by a releasable peel strip 22 or 60.  The releasable peel strip" 22 or 60 can be a white Kraft paper which is coated on one side so that it can be released from the adhesive 96. The coating can be a silicone coating, such as a silicone polymer commercially available from Akrosil having an office located at 206 Garfield Avenue, Menasha, Wisconsin 54952.  The release strips 22 and 60 are designed to be removed by the user prior to attachment of the absorbent articles 12 and 52, respectively, to the inner crotch portion of her undergarment.<br>
Referring now to Figures 45-47, the construction of a catamenial tampon 14 component of the present invention is shown.  The tampon 14 includes an absorbent 108 which has been compressed into a generally cylindrical shape and a liquid-permeable cover 130 which surrounds or encloses at least a portion of the absorbent 108. The tampon 14 can be constructed by positioning the absorbent 108 on the cover 130, as indicated in Figure 45 and then rolling the two layers into a generally cylindrical shape.  This uncompressed cylindrical shape, shown in Figure 46, is known as a "softwind."  The softwind is then compressed into a tampon "pledget" 14 as is shown in Figure 47.  It should be noted that it is also possible first to roll the absorbent 108 into a generally cylindrical shape and then wrap the liquid-permeable cover 130 around it.  It also is possible to roll up and compress the absorbent 108 before wrapping it in the cover 130.<br>
The tampon "pledget" as shown as the catamenial tampon 14 in Figure 4 7 is an interna] sanitary protection device used for absorbing menses, blood, and other body fluids.  The tampon 14 is normally used during a woman's menstrual i^eriod to prevent leakage of menstrual fluid.  The tampon 14 includes an absorbent material, such as cotton, rayon, cellulose wadding, synthetic sponge, cellulose fluff, synthetic fibers, or combinations thereof, which can be compressed into a generally cylindrical shape.  The cylindrically shaped absorbent material is usually surrounded by a liquid-permeable cover.<br><br>
Catamenial tampons 14 are available in a variety of sizes and shapes so as'to accomnodate different size vaginal cavities. The tampons 14 are sufficiently compressed to retain their sizes and shapes under normal atmospheric conditions but are designed to expand readily when wetted by body fluid.  For example, after a tampon 14 is inserted into a woman's vaginal tract and is contacted by body fluid, the compressed tampon 14 attempts to re-expand approximately to it's original uncompressed size.  This structural change allows the tampon to fill the vaginal cavity and absorb body fluid thereby preventing leakage.<br>
Referring to Figure 47, the tampon 14 further includes a withdrawal string 132 which is secured to either the absorbent 108, the cover 130, or to both and provides a safe and reli-able means by which the tampon 14 can be withdrawn from a woman's vagina after it has absorbed a certain amount of menstrual fluid.  The withdrawal string 132 can be assembled with the softwind, as depicted in Figure 46, or it can be attached to the compressed pledget, depending upon one's preference.  In either case, the free end of the withdrawal string 132 is tied in a knot 134 to assure that it will not be separated from the pledget.<br>
The absorbent 108 can be formed from absorbent fibers which are first assembled into an absorbent ribbon or sheet. Alternatively, the absorbent 108 can be formed from absorbent fibers which are assembled and compressed into a generally cylindrical configuration.  The absorbent 108 is preferably formed from cellulosic fibers, such as cotton and rayon.  The absorbent can be 100% cotton, 100 rayon, or a blend of both cotton and rayon.  A ratio of from about 15% cotton and about 85% rayon works well.  The particular blend of fibers can vary depending on one's preference.<br>
The cotton fibers should have a staple length of between about 5 mm to about 20 mm.  The fibers can be bleached if desired.  Bleaching will make the fibers whiter in appearance.<br><br>
The cotton should generally have a fiber size of between about 150 to about 280 microns.<br>
The rayon fibers should have a staple length of between about 20 mm to about 3 5 mm.     The fibers can also be bleached if desired.  The rayon fibers should have a denier of between about 25 to about 28.  Denier is a unit of fineness of yarn based on a standard of 50 milligrams per 450 meters of yarn.<br>
The absorbent 108, when formed from an absorbent ribbon, is constructed from a blend of rayon and cotton fibers in a process known to those skilled in the art as "carding." Depending upon the desired absorbency one desires in the finished tampon, the basis weight of the absorbent ribbon can vary.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set absorbency standards for "regular," "super," and "super-plus" size tampons.  In order to meet these standards for the three above-identified sizes, the absorbent ribbons are targeted to have basis weights of about 127 grams per square meter (g/m^) , 170 g/m2' and 230 g/m2 respectively.  Typically, the carding process is controlled to produce an absorbent ribbon with a width of about 50 mm for a "regular" size tampon and a width of about 55 mm for both the "super" and "super-plus" size tampons.  During the assembly process, one end of the rectangular absorbent ribbon having a length of about 300 mm is positioned over a portion of the cover 130.  The two materials then are rolled up into a generally cylindrically shape.  This rolling action will cause the absorbent 108 to be located on the interior and be surrounded by the cover 130.  The cover 130 will surround the exterior surface of the softwind and can overlap upon itself, if desired. The cover 130 can be bonded, as indicated by numeral 136, to itself and/or to the absorbent ribbon lOR using heat, pressure, or a combination of heat and pressure.  The softwind then i s compressed into a finished tampon pledges 14.  Preferably, the bonding 136 will occur during the compression step.<br><br>
The cover 130 can be formed from woven or non-woven materials 'having a porous substrate.  Woven materials include textile fabrics and non-woven materials include spunbond and bended carded webs.  Both of these non-woven materials are commercially sold by Kimberly-Clark Corporation, 401 N. Lake Street/ Neenah, Wisconsin 54956.  Another non-woven material which can be used as the cover 130 is formed from 100 percent polyester fibers held tegether by a binder.  This polyester fibers material is known as powder-bonded-carded web (PBCW) and also is available from Kimberly-Clark Corporation in Neenah, Wisconsin,<br>
The withdrawal string 132 can be constructed from various types of threads or ribbons.  A thread made from 100 percent cotton fibers works well.  The withdrawal string 132 normally has a length extending beyond one end of the tampon 14 from about 2 inches to about 8 inches (about 50.8 mm to about 203.2 mm), preferably from about 4 inches to about 6 inches (about 102 mm to about 152.4 mm), and most preferably, about 5 inches (127 mm). The withdrawal string 132 can be dyed and treated with an anti-wicking agent, such as wax, before being secured to the softwind or pledget to prevent it from wicking menstrual fluid.  A dry, clean withdrawal string 132 is preferred by the user when she goes to remove the tampon 14.<br>
Referring now to Figure 48, the tampon applicator components of the present invention are constructed to provide a pair of elongated, concentric, telescoping tubes so that the outer tube can carry the tampon's absorbent material, the tampon's 'pledget," while the inner tube serves as a plunger for dispensing the pledget.<br>
The tampon applicator components for use in the packaging of the present invention are formed from either a plastic or paper.  Plastic tampon applicators are preferred by many women because of a molded-in grip ring and a petal-shaped forward end which facilitates insertion of the applicator article while retaining and protecting the tampon while in the outer<br><br>
ube.  Plastic tampon applicators typically are formed from olyethylene using injection molding.<br>
A convenient place to dispose of a tampon applicator is n a toilet bowl.  However, currently available commercial )lastic applicators formed of polyethylene are ill-suited for ;uch disposal.  Presently available commercial plastic appli-:ators of polyethylene will flush, but they settle in septic :anks without decomposing.  They accumulate on screens in faste-water treatment plants, creating blockages.  If the screens don't stop the applicator articles, they can escape Into the environment intact, washing up on beaches.  Plastic applicators don't always float so they can't be skimmed, and they don't settle to the bottom of settling tanks.<br>
The novel feminine sanitary protection packaging of the present invention provides a solution for these problems in providing means for disposing of the tampon applicators without causing these problems.<br>
Referring to Figure 48, a tampon applicator 100 includes an outer tubular member 34 and a plunger 35.  The outer tube 34 preferably is fabricated to include a one-piece main cylindrical body 112 extending into four or five flexible petal tips 109 disposed on the front end of the outer tube 34.  A finger grip ring 116 is formed on the opposite end of the outer tube 34.  The tampon applicator further includes the plunger 35 having a plunger body 122 adapted to serve as an inner tubular member.  The plunger 35 has finger grip ring 126.  The plunger 35 is designed to urge a pledget (not shown), housed in the hollow cylindrical body 112 of the outer tnbular member 34, through the open petal tips 109 and further<br><br><br>
