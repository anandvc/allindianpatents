				<td>ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH AN AXIALLY-MOVEABLE<br>
SELECTABLE ONE-WAY CLUTCH ASSEMBLY<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/975,949, filed on September 28, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to an electrically variable<br>
transmission (EVT) with a selectable one-way clutch (SOWC) assembly having an<br>
axially-moveable portion for establishing one of three different clutch operating states.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An EVT utilizes differential gearing and one or two electric<br>
motor/generators, also referred to as "motors" for simplicity, to allow adjustment of a<br>
speed ratio of a transmission input over a transmission output. An EVT may be<br>
particularly useful in a hybrid electric vehicle when used in conjunction with an electric<br>
energy storage device, such as a battery. An EVT may be able to save fuel relative to<br>
certain conventional automatic transmissions, in part because the EVT uses the energy-<br>
conserving action of the electric motors rather than the energy-dissipating action of a<br>
hydraulic torque converter. Additionally, an EVT provides the ability to continuously<br>
vary a transmission ratio, as well as the ability to recover energy during a braking event<br>
or slowing of the vehicle and to store this captured energy within the energy storage<br>
device. Finally, an EVT can assist a smaller and generally more efficient engine in<br>
propelling the vehicle.<br>
[0004]	An EVT may have a single range, also referred to as a "mode", wherein<br>
the input speed, the output speed, and one or more motor speeds are a linear<br>
combination of one another. For example, the output speed may be one third of the<br><br>
sum of twice the speed of the input and the speed of one electric motor. Alternately, an<br>
EVT may have multiple ranges/modes to reduce the motor power required for adjusting<br>
the transmission speed ratio and a transmission or transfer of power from the input to<br>
the output.<br>
[0005]	The multiple ranges/modes described above are activated by the<br>
engagement of selectable torque-transmitting devices or clutches. For example, a two-<br>
mode EVT may have one range for high transmission speed ratios, which is activated<br>
by the engagement of one clutch, and another range for low transmission speed ratios,<br>
which is activated by engagement of another clutch. Since each of these ranges is<br>
continuously variable, the EVT may be designed so that shifting between the two<br>
ranges may be accomplished with the transmission operating at a particular speed ratio<br>
which is common to both ranges. Therefore, the shift event may be made<br>
synchronously, that is, with zero relative speed across the clutches during the shift<br>
event. The shift event is then simply a torque transfer between one clutch and another<br>
clutch without the necessity of slipping between the clutches, while the electric motors<br>
control the speed ratio through the transmission both before and after the shift event.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	Accordingly, an EVT is constructed with a SOWC that is operable for<br>
connecting first and second members or shafts of the EVT. The SOWC has a pair of<br>
rings, and is actuated or applied by moving one ring in an axial direction to select<br>
between multiple ranges or SOWC operating modes. The different transmission<br>
operating modes achieved through selection of the different SOWC operating modes<br>
reduce the motor power required for adjusting the transmission speed ratio through the<br>
range required for optimal engine efficiency over a wide range of vehicle operating<br>
conditions. Multiple ranges are also useful for reducing the amount of mechanical<br>
energy from the engine that must be converted to electrical energy and back into<br>
mechanical energy, for reducing the losses which come from these conversions, and<br><br>
therefore for improving fuel economy if greater losses are not incurred from the<br>
devices necessary for operating in multiple ranges.<br>
[0007]	According to one embodiment, an electric motor can be connected to one<br>
or both of the first and second shafts to control a relative speed of the first and second<br>
rings. The SOWC includes a blocking device that moves through frictional contact with<br>
the first ring, with the blocking device at least partially determining a transition of the<br>
SOWC from a transmission of torque in one rotational direction to a transmission of<br>
torque in both rotational directions. The SOWC can be configured to include two sets<br>
of struts oriented in opposite directions, and the blocking device can include a plurality<br>
of windows aligned with respect to the struts to establish one of a plurality of different<br>
clutch operating modes, including holding torque in one, both, or neither rotational<br>
direction, depending one which set or sets of struts are blocked by the blocking device.<br>
[0008]	A SOWC is provided for use with an EVT, and includes a first and a<br>
second ring, a plurality of strut pieces each configured for holding torque in one of a<br>
first and a second rotational direction to establish one of a plurality of different clutch<br>
operating modes, and a blocking device. The blocking device has a plurality of<br>
windows, and moves through frictional contact with the second ring to align the<br>
windows. The SOWC is applied by moving the second ring in an axial direction with<br>
respect to an axis of rotation of the first ring and the second ring.<br>
[0009]	A method is also provided for reducing losses due to drag within an<br>
EVT. The method provides a SOWC having an axially-moveable second ring, a<br>
rotatable first ring, and an axially-moveable and selectively rotatable blocking device,<br>
and applies an apply force to the second ring to move the second ring into contact with<br>
the blocking device. The blocking device is then moved in an axial direction to<br>
establish frictional contact between the blocking device and the first ring. The<br>
frictional contact rotates the blocking device to align the blocking device and the first<br>
ring. The method includes locking the rotation of the first ring in at least one direction<br>
when the desired alignment is established, thus applying the SOWC, and releasing the<br><br>
SOWC by moving the second ring and the blocking device a predetermined axial<br>
distance away from the first ring.<br>
[0010]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
[0020]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, and beginning with Figure 1, a<br>
transmission 10, shown in one embodiment as an electrically variable transmission<br>
(EVT), has a selectable one-way clutch 18, hereinafter referred to simply as the SOWC<br>
18, with an axis of rotation 11 (see Figure 2). The SOWC 18 is shown as a mechanical<br>
diode-type one-way clutch device, but it may also take the form of a sprag clutch, a roller<br>
clutch, or another style of one-way clutch within the scope of the invention. The<br>
transmission 10 has a stationary outer housing or case 13 that is constructed or cast from<br>
a ferrous or a nonferrous material, and within which the SOWC 18 is enclosed. The<br>
SOWC 18 includes a first race or ring 20, second race or ring 22, and a selector plate/ring<br>
or a blocking device 50, each of which will be described in detail below with reference to<br>
Figure 2.<br>
[0021]	The SOWC 18 also includes an actuator 16, such as a hydraulic apply<br>
piston or other hydraulically-actuated device, that is moveable in response to a force<br>
imparted by pressurized hydraulic fluid 23 (see Figure 2). The fluid 23 of Figure 2 may<br>
be delivered to the SOWC 18 by a pump (not shown) as needed through one or more<br>
fluid channels (not shown), as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The transmission 10 has a first rotatable shaft 12A that is connected to an electric<br>
motor/generator 17, and the transmission 10 further includes a second rotatable shaft<br>
12B. The SOWC 18 is operable for transferring torque from a power source, such as an<br>
engine (not shown) and/or the electric motor/generator 17, to the drive wheels of a<br>
vehicle (not shown) by selectively transferring torque between the first and second<br>
rotatabfe shafts 12A and 12B, respectively, as needed, and/or between one of the<br>
rotatable shafts 12A, 12B and a stationary member of the transmission 10, such as the<br>
case 13.<br>
[0022]	In accordance with the invention, the transmission 10 may successfully<br>
shift gears using the SOWC 18 under all necessary operating conditions, including<br>
some random output torque fluctuations that may be caused by rough roads. The<br>
SOWC 18 does not cause significant drag and does not require a high-volume, high-<br>
pressure supply of oil for actuation in the manner of conventional wet plate clutches.<br><br>
Using the SOWC 18, therefore, the transmission 10 will gain a substantial further<br>
advantage by lowering the losses occurring within the transmission 10, thus optimizing<br>
fuel economy while reducing emissions.<br>
[0023]	A portion of the SOWC 18, such as the second ring 22, is splined or<br>
otherwise operatively connected to the first rotatable shaft 12A so that the second ring 22<br>
is configured for or is capable of axial motion along the first rotatable shaft 12A.<br>
Another portion of the SOWC 18, such as the first ring 20, is splined to the second<br>
rotatable shaft 12B of the transmission 10, so that the first ring 20 resists axial motion.<br>
The SOWC 18 connects the first and second rotating shafts 12A, 12B, respectively, and<br>
so may be called a "rotating clutch", while an otherwise similarly configured clutch 19<br>
connects the second rotating shaft 12B with the non-rotating case 13 or another stationary<br>
member, and so may be called a "stationary clutch".<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 2 as one possible embodiment of the SOWC 18, the<br>
first ring 20 includes a circular central bore 39, and includes a plurality of radially-inward<br>
projecting teeth or splines (not shown) which are configured to engage or mate with slots<br>
or grooves of a rotatable body, such as the first rotatable shaft 12A, to thereby rotate in<br>
conjunction therewith. Likewise, the second ring 22 has a circular central bore 24<br>
through which a rotatable and/or groundable hub portion (not shown) extends. To enable<br>
the transfer of torque from the first rotatable shaft 12A (see Figure 1) to the second ring<br>
22, the second ring 22 may be operatively connected to a reaction gear of a compound<br>
planetary gear set (not shown), or the hub portion (not shown) may be directly splined to<br>
the central bore 24, depending on the application, as will be understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0025]	The second ring 22 is shaped or configured to capture a plurality of<br>
torque-holding wedges, strut pieces, or struts 34 and a first ring 20 is shaped or<br>
configured to include a plurality of angled strut pockets 36 for receiving the struts 34,<br>
with two sets of the struts 34 and pockets 36 oriented differently in order to hold torque<br>
in a particular direction, as will be explained later hereinbelow. The blocking device 50<br>
is positioned between the respective first and second rings 20 and 22, and is configured<br>
with a plurality of alternating windows 54 and blocking sections 55 arranged<br><br>
circumferentially around the blocking device 50. The alternating windows 54 and<br>
blocking sections 55 are positioned relative to the struts 34 so that by rotating the<br>
blocking device 50 relative to the second ring 22, all of the struts 34 that are oriented or<br>
facing in one direction or the other direction may be blocked or otherwise prevented from<br>
engaging the first ring 20.<br>
[0026]	An optional centering spring 38 is fitted between the second ring 22 and<br>
the blocking device 50 and is adapted for aligning each of the alternating windows 54 of<br>
the blocking device 50 with a different one of the struts 34. One end of the centering<br>
spring 38 may be press-fitted to the blocking device 50 through a mating hole 35 formed<br>
or bored therein, and at another end to the second ring 22 through a mating hole 31<br>
formed or bored therein. The centering spring 38 is positioned or routed external to any<br>
interface formed between the second ring 22 and the blocking device 50 when the second<br>
ring 22 contacts the blocking device 50, as described in more detail below.<br>
[0027]	The second ring 22 is configured with a plurality of strut wells 32, which<br>
in the embodiment shown in Figure 2 may be configured as through-openings through the<br>
second ring 22, i.e., from a front face 22A of the second ring 22 completely through to a<br>
rear face 22B of the second ring 22. Half of the strut wells 32 are oriented in one<br>
direction, and the remaining strut wells 32 are oriented or aligned in the opposite<br>
direction. In this manner, approximately half of the struts 34 are allowed to "lock" or<br>
engage with the angled strut pockets 36 of the first ring 20 at any given time to lock<br>
torque in a corresponding rotational direction. The different orientation of the struts 34<br>
allows some struts 34 to be deployed in an axial direction (arrow A) while the remaining<br>
struts 34 are depressed by the blocking sections 55 of the blocking device 50, so that the<br>
rotation of the first ring 20 may be locked or held in one rotational direction or the other<br>
rotational.<br>
[0028]	The blocking device 50 has three effective positions relative to the second<br>
ring 22: a first position allowing those of the struts 34 that are oriented or facing in one<br>
common direction to engage the first ring 20 and lock it in one rotational direction<br>
relative to the second ring 22, a second position allowing those of the struts 34 that<br>
oriented or facing in the other common direction to engage the first ring 20 and lock it in<br><br>
the other rotational direction relative to the second ring 22, and a third position which<br>
may be assisted by the centering spring 38, the third position allowing all of the struts 34<br>
of either orientation to engage the first ring 20 and lock it in both directions relative to the<br>
first ring 22, provided that the actuator 16 has moved the second ring 22 in close enough<br>
proximity to the first ring 20.<br>
[0029]	The SOWC 18 further includes the actuator 16 also shown in Figure 1,<br>
such as a hydraulic apply piston responsive to pressurized hydraulic fluid 23, that may be<br>
operatively connected to or formed integrally with an apply ring 26. The second ring 22<br>
and the blocking device 50 together make up an axially-moveable portion 21 of the<br>
SOWC 18, i.e., a portion of the SOWC 18 that is moveable in an axial direction in<br>
response to an apply force in the direction of arrow A. The apply ring 26 has a plurality<br>
of axially-projecting teeth 26A that are mutually spaced around a circumference of the<br>
apply ring 26. The teeth 26A have an upper surface 27, and are each separated by a<br>
lower surface or valley 28. As the strut wells 32 of the second ring 22 are through-<br>
openings as described above, i.e., they each extend axially through the second ring 22<br>
from the front face 22A to the rear face 22B, movement of the apply ring 26 in the<br>
direction of arrow A allows the teeth 26A to enter a corresponding strut well 32<br>
positioned adjacent thereto.<br>
[0030]	The axial movement of the apply ring 26 in response to an apply force in<br>
the direction of arrow A acts as a force on a strut spring 37 that is positioned in each of<br>
the strut wells 32 between the upper surface 27 of each tooth 26A and the strut 34. If this<br>
force acting on each of the strut springs 37 is not opposed by a blocking surface 55 of the<br>
blocking device 50 positioned between a strut 34 and a mating angled strut pocket 36 in<br>
the first ring 20, the spring force imparted by the strut spring 37 will force each strut 34<br>
into a mating angled pocket 36 of the first ring 20. If this force is so opposed, the strut<br>
spring 37 will compress, providing a potential force for rapidly deploying the strut 34<br>
when the blocking device 50 is again moved.<br>
[0031]	Once the blocking device 50 is placed in direct contact with the second<br>
ring 22, a continued application of force in the direction of arrow A will eventually move<br>
the blocking device 50 into contact with the first ring 20. Frictional forces imparted by<br><br>
the rotational motion of the first ring 20, and by any intervening fluid film from the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid 23 present between the first ring 20 and the blocking device<br>
50, will tend to drag the blocking device 50 in the same rotational direction. This drag<br>
will ultimately position the blocking device 50 in such a manner as to cover one<br>
commonly oriented set of struts 34 with the blocking surfaces 55, and to free the other<br>
commonly oriented set of struts 34 to move or deploy through the windows 54 into the<br>
angled strut wells 36 of the first ring 20. That is, the blocking device 50 will rotate to<br>
cover the set of struts 34 oriented so as to immediately attempt to the lock the first ring 20<br>
with respect to the second ring 22 as the struts 34 and the strut springs 37 are actuated by<br>
the apply ring 26.<br>
[0032]	A return mechanism 58 is provided within the SOWC 18, with the return<br>
mechanism 58 being configured as a spring or another suitable device providing a<br>
sufficient return force for moving the blocking device 50 and the second ring 22 in the<br>
direction of arrow R a sufficient distance for disengaging the struts 34 from the first ring<br>
20. Therefore, when an apply force in the direction of arrow A is discontinued or<br>
removed, such as by temporarily interrupting a supply of pressurized hydraulic fluid 23 to<br>
the actuator 16, the return force in the direction of arrow R allows the SOWC 18 to<br>
disengage and to "freewheel" until engagement of the SOWC 18 in one or both directions<br>
is desired.<br>
[0033]	Referring to Figure 3A, various clutch operating modes are shown for the<br>
SOWC 18 (see Figures 1 and 2), with each mode defining a direction of torque holding<br>
with respect to the SOWC 18. In Mode 1, pressure to the actuator 16 (see Figure 2) is<br>
turned off, and the SOWC 18 is allowed to "freewheel", i.e., torque is not held in either<br>
rotational direction. Mode 1 permits the first ring 20 to rotate or spin unimpeded with<br>
respect to the second ring 22. In Modes 2A and 3, pressure to the actuator 16 is turned<br>
on, and torque is locked or held in one rotational direction.   Modes 2A and 2B are<br>
identical in operation, except for the direction in which torque is held. For example, in<br>
Mode 2A the first ring 20 may be permitted to freewheel or rotate unimpeded in a<br>
forward rotational direction, and to lock or be prevented from rotating in the reverse<br>
rotational direction, while Mode 2B would likewise permit the reverse rotation of the first<br><br>
ring 20, holding torque in the forward direction. Finally, in Mode 3 the SOWC 18 is<br>
locked, i.e., torque is held in both rotational directions. Each of the operating modes<br>
described generally above as applied to the SOWC 18 are shown in detail in the<br>
fragmentary cross-sectional side views of Figures 3B, 3C, and 3D, respectively.<br>
[0034]	In each of Figures 3B, 3C, and 3D, the angled strut pockets 36 of Figure 2<br>
are shown as the angled strut pockets 36A and 36B to differentiate their different torque-<br>
holding orientation. Each of the strut pockets 36A, 36B has a substantially vertical<br>
locking surface 40 and an angled surface 41. The struts 34 of Figure 1 are represented by<br>
their respective orientation as 34A, 34B. The vertical locking surface 40 is configured<br>
and/or shaped to oppose a strut 34A, 34B as needed to thereby prevent rotation of the<br>
first ring 20 in one direction when either of Modes 2A, 2B, or 3 are selected (see Figure<br>
3A). Likewise, the sloped surface 41 is configured and/or shaped to allow a strut 34A,<br>
34B to be depressed by the blocking device 50 into a mating strut well 32A, 32B to<br>
permit relative rotation of one of the respective first and second rings 20, 22 (see Figure<br>
2). When the SOWC 18 is locked in one direction and is transmitting torque, the<br>
separation of the ends of the struts 34 in the axial direction may create a force that tends<br>
to separate the first ring 20 from the second ring 22, so that upon the SOWC 18 locking<br>
in one direction, the friction force on the blocking device 50 is reduced, and the blocking<br>
device 50 is rotated by the centering spring 35 (see Figure 2) into the center position<br>
shown in Figure 3E. Alternately, the centering spring 35 may assist friction force on the<br>
blocking device 50 so that as the first ring 20 rotates slightly relative to the second ring<br>
22 to lock via a commonly oriented set of the struts 34, the blocking device 50 also<br>
rotates slightly relative to the second ring 22, thus uncovering the other commonly<br>
oriented set of struts 34.   In this position, all of the struts 34 are aligned with the<br>
windows 54 in the blocking device 50, and may therefore engage the first ring 20.<br>
[0035]	As shown in Figures 3B through 3E, a sensor (S) 29 can sense, detect, or<br>
otherwise determine the relative speed of the rings 20, 22 for use in controlling the<br>
SOWC 16. The second ring 22 may be rotating or grounded, such as to the stationary<br>
transmission housing or casing 13 (see Figure 1), and first ring 20 is always allowed to<br>
rotate. The first ring 20 may be connected to motor/generator 17 (see Figure 1), which is<br><br>
in communication with a motor controller (not shown) that is configured to synchronize<br>
the rotational speeds of the first and second rings 20, 22 to facilitate actuation of the<br>
SO WC 18. However, in the event the second ring 22 is not grounded and therefore is<br>
also rotating, the motor/generator 17 would be likewise connected to the second ring 22<br>
and in communication with the controller (not shown), as will be understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0036]	In Figure 3B, and representing Mode 1 or a "freewheeling" mode, the<br>
blocking device 50 is separated from the first ring 20 by the return mechanism 58 (see<br>
Figure 2), thus forcing the struts 34 out of engagement with each respective mating strut<br>
pocket 36. The apply force represented by the arrow A, as shown also in Figure 2, is zero<br>
or off, allowing the previously described return force (arrow R) to move or separate the<br>
blocking device 50 and the second ring 22 from the first ring 20. The initial distance of<br>
separation (d1) is sufficient for ensuring that no portion of any of the struts 34A, 34B may<br>
contact the first ring 20. The SOWC 18 therefore freewheels in either direction, as<br>
represented by arrows 1 and 2.<br>
[0037]	Referring to Figure 3C, which represents Mode 2A or torque-holding in a<br>
reverse direction, the apply pressure (arrow A) is turned on, thus forcing the apply ring<br>
26 to move axially in the direction of arrow A. This moves the axially-moveable portion<br>
21 of the SOWC 18, and the distance of separation (d2) between the actuator ring 26 and<br>
the first ring 20 is less than the initial distance of separation (d1) shown in Figure 3B.<br>
The blocking device 50 blocks the struts 34A, with the strut springs 37 forcing any<br>
previously depressed strut 34B into engagement with the first ring 20. The struts 34B<br>
"lock' via interference with a vertical locking surface 40 of each angled strut well 36B<br>
into which the struts 34B are forced or moved. The orientation of the struts 34B within<br>
the angled strut wells 36B therefore ensures that torque is held or prevented in the reverse<br>
position by allowing the first ring 20 to rotate in the direction of arrow 2, but by<br>
preventing the first ring 20 from rotating in the direction of arrow 1 (see Figure 3B).<br>
[0038]	Referring to Figure 3D, which represents Mode 2B or torque-holding in a<br>
forward direction, the apply pressure (arrow A) remains on, still forcing the apply ring 26<br>
to move in the direction of arrow A. The blocking device 50 blocks the struts 34B, with<br><br>
strut springs 37 forcing any previously depressed strut 34A into engagement with the first<br>
ring 20. The struts 34A "lock" via interference with a vertical locking surface 40 of each<br>
well 36A into which the struts 34A are forced or moved. The orientation of the struts<br>
34A within the wells 36B therefore ensures that torque is held or prevented in the reverse<br>
position by preventing the first ring 20 from rotating in the direction of arrow 2.<br>
[0039]	Turning to Figure 3E, which represents Mode 3 or torque-holding in both<br>
rotational directions, the apply pressure (arrow A) remains on, still forcing the apply ring<br>
26 to move in the direction of arrow A. The SOWC 18 stops, with zero relative motion<br>
between the inner and second rings 20 and 22, respectively. Drag on the blocking device<br>
50 therefore disappears. Absent such drag forces, the centering ring 38 (see Figure 2) is<br>
allowed to force or pull the blocking device 50 into a desired alignment with the second<br>
ring 22, with the strut springs 37 allowed to move any previously depressed struts 34A,<br>
34B into engagement with the first ring 20. The struts 34A and 34B therefore "lock" the<br>
torque via interference with a vertical locking surface 40 of each well 36A, 36B into<br>
which the struts 34A, 34B are respectively forced or moved. The orientation of the struts<br>
34A, 34B within the angled strut wells 36A, 36B therefore ensures that torque is held or<br>
pre\ ented in both the forward and reverse positions by preventing the first ring 20 from<br>
rotating in the direction of arrows 1 and 2 (see Figure 3B).<br>
[0040]	As shown in Figure 4A, while in Mode 1, i.e., "freewheeling", in order to<br>
apply the SOWC 18, a controller (not shown) cycles or synchronizes the first and second<br>
rings 20, 22, respectively, so that a differential speed Δs therebetween approaches<br>
approximately zero revolution per minute, as represented by the point 61. A signal<br>
communicated at point 61 precipitates a change from Mode 1 to Mode 2 when a speed<br>
sensor (not shown) detects that the direction of Δs, which changes at point 62, reaches a<br>
non-negative quantity, i.e., at point 64, at which point the SOWC 18 of Figure 2 is<br>
"shifted" or changed to either of Mode 2A or Mode 2B, depending on the rotational<br>
direction of first ring 20, and thus holding torque in the respective reverse or forward<br>
rotational direction.<br>
[0041]	Because of the inherent time delay in making a physical shift by<br>
movement of the blocking device plate 50 (see Figures 2 and 3B through 3E), a slight<br><br>
time lag At occurs before Mode 2 is fully realized at point 65. While the direction of Δs<br>
is positive, the SOWC 18 continues freewheeling. While in Mode 2, when the direction<br>
of Δs turns negative, i.e., at point 68, the clutch 18 locks. When the speed sensor (not<br>
shown) detects zero differential clutch speed and zero speed change, the SOWC 18<br>
changes to Mode 3 so that rotational motion is prevented in both directions, as shown in<br>
Figure 2D, thereby freeing or releasing the electric motor/generator 17 (see Figure 1) to<br>
change speeds as necessary. Because of the time delay in making the physical shift by<br>
actuation of the blocking device 50, a slight time lag At occurs before Mode 3 is fully<br>
realized at point 69.<br>
[0042]	Referring to Figure 4B, a similar speed curve is shown describing the<br>
release of the SOWC 18, beginning with dual-directional torque holding of Mode 3. To<br>
initiate a release of the SOWC 18, a mode change is signaled from Mode 3 to Mode 2 at<br>
point 71. Prior to a mode change to Mode 2, the SOWC 18 is momentarily loaded in the<br>
direction opposite that of the impending clutch release in the opposite direction, and then<br>
in Mode 2A or 2B, the clutch 18 is unloaded so that the SOWC 18 may be easily<br>
released. When the speed sensor (not shown) detects that the quantity Δs is positive, the<br>
operating mode is changed to "freewheel in both directions", i.e., Mode 1 at point 72,<br>
which is the initial state of Figure 4A as previously described hereinabove.<br>
