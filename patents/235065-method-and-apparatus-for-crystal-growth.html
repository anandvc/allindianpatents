This application claims the benefits of and priority to U.S. provisional patent<br>
application serial no. 60/419,769 filed on October 18,2002, the entire disclosures of which<br>
are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention generally relates to growing crystalline or polycrystalline materials.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for growing crystalline or<br>
polycrystalline silicon sheet material for use in making low dost solar cells.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Silicon sheet material or ribbon is particularly important in making low cost solar<br>
cells. Continuous growth of silicon ribbon obviates the need for slicing of bulk produced<br>
silicon. Methods for doing this are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,594,229; 4,627,887;<br>
4,661,200; 4,689,109; 6,217,649, and IP No 199943 and IP A no. IN/PCT/2001/01144, the disclosures of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In these patents, continuous silicon ribbon<br>
growth is carried out by introducing two high temperature material strings up through a<br>
crucible that includes a shallow layer of molten silicon. The strings serve to stabilize the<br>
edges of the growing ribbon and the molten silicon freezes into a solid ribbon just above tfi6'<br>
molten layer. The molten layer that forms between the strings and the growing ribbon is<br>
defined by the meniscus of the molten silicon. U.S. Patent No.*^2t^-, 649 'and FP3B&amp; 19394 2&gt;<br>
describe a method and apparatus for continuous replenishment of the feedstock material m a<br>
continuous silicon ribbon.<br>
In order to produce lower cost solar cells and hence expand large-scale electrical<br>
applications of solar electricity, it is important to have lower cost and higher quality substrate<br>
materials for making the solar cell. The current invention provides new and improved<br>
methods and apparatus for growing silicon ribbons.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention, in one embodiment, relates to a method and apparatus of growing or<br>
pulling a crystalline or poly-crystalline sheet material or ribbon from a melt, wherein the melt<br>
is retained by capillary attachment to edge features of a mesa crucible. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the invention is practiced with string ribbon or edge-stabilized ribbon wherein<br>
stringS or fibers are used to stabilize the edges of the ribbon by capillary attachment This<br>
method allows for the growth of ribbons, including continuous ribbons, directly from the<br>
surface of the melt. The melt may be of infinite extent in directions perpendicular to the.,<br>
growth direction of the ribbon, which is the location of the ribbon defined by the location of<br>
the strings.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of forming a crystalline ribbon. The<br>
method includes providing a mesa crucible having a top surface and edges defining a<br>
boundary of the top surface of the mesa crucible and forming a melt of a source material on<br>
the top surface of the mesa crucible. The edges of the melt are retained by capillary<br>
attachment to the edges of the mesa crucible. A crystalline ribbon is pulled from the melt. In<br>
various embodiments, the pulling step includes placing a seed in the melt and pulling the seed<br>
from the melt between a pair of strings positioned along the edges of the crystalline ribbon.<br>
The melt is solidified between the pair of strings to form the crystalline ribbon, and the<br>
crystalline ribbon is continuously pulled from the melt.<br>
In one embodiment, at least a portion of a boundary profile of the melt is concave<br>
downward prior to the pulling step. At least a portion of the boundary profile of the melt may<br>
be concave downward outside the region of the crystalline ribbon as well. In one<br>
embodiment, pulling the crystalline ribbon from the melt forms an inflection point in a cross-<br>
sectional boundary profile of the melt. In some embodiments, the method includes forming a<br>
substantial portion of the melt above the edges of the mesa crucible. The inflection point in at<br>
least a portion of the cross-sectional boundary profile of the melt predisposes the crystalline<br>
ribbon to grow substantially flat.<br>
In various embodiments, more than one crystalline ribbon may be formed. The<br>
method may include replenishing the source material on the top surface of the mesa crucible<br>
for continuous crystalline ribbon growth. In some embodiments, the temperature of the mesa<br>
crucible is controlled while forming the crystalline ribbon.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus for forming a crystalline ribbon.<br>
The apparatus includes a mesa crucible having edges defining a boundary of a top surface of<br>
the mesa crucible. The mesa crucible retains edges of a melt by capillary attachment to the<br>
edges of the mesa crucible. In some embodiments, a pair of strings is positioned along the<br>
edges of the crystalline ribbon. The pair of strings define a region within which a crystalline<br>
ribbon is formed. The mesa crucible may be graphite. In some embodiments, the edges of<br>
the mesa crucible define a recessed top surface of the mesa crucible. The width of the mesa<br>
crucible may be between about 15 mm and about 30 mm.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of forming a crystalline ribbon.<br>
The method includes providing a crucible having a top surface and edges defining a boundary<br>
of the top surface of the crucible. A melt of a source material is formed on the top surface of<br>
the crucible, and a crystalline ribbon is pulled from the melt. The crucible may be a mesa<br>
crucible. In various embodiments, the melt has a boundary profile at least a portion of which<br>
is concave downward. In some embodiments, pulling a crystalline ribbon from the melt<br>
forms an inflection point in at least a portion of a cross-sectional boundary profile of the melt.<br>
A substantial portion of the melt may be above the edges of the crucible.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of controlling temperature of a<br>
mesa crucible while forming a crystalline ribbon. The method includes positioning an<br>
insulator comprising movable elements along a mesa crucible and disposing the mesa<br>
crucible in a furnace. Controlled heat leaks are created by moving the moveable elements of<br>
the insulator relative to the mesa crucible.<br>
In still another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus for controlling temperature<br>
of a mesa crucible while forming a crystalline ribbon. The apparatus includes a mesa crucible<br>
disposed within a furnace, and an insulator comprising movable elements disposed along the<br>
mesa crucible. The apparatus also includes means for moving the moveable elements of the<br>
insulator relative to the mesa crucible to create controlled heats leaks.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of replenishing a melt of a source<br>
material on a mesa crucible. The method includes distributing a source material onto a mesa<br>
crucible, thereby reducing the heat load required to melt the source material.<br>
In one embodiment, the distributing step includes positioning a feeder at a distance from<br>
a mesa crucible and moving a feeder in a first direction and a second direction along a mesa<br>
crucible. The feeder is vibrated during motion in at least one of the first direction and the<br>
second direction, such that a source material disposed within the feeder enters a melt on the<br>
mesa crucible during such motion. The method may include melting the source material prior<br>
to source material from a subsequent motion in the first direction reaching the melt. In<br>
various embodiments, the distance from the mesa crucible is less than the width of the mesa<br>
crucible.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus for replenishing a melt of a<br>
source material on a mesa crucible. The apparatus includes means for distributing a source<br>
material onto a mesa crucible, thereby reducing the heat load required to melt the source<br>
material.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention, in one embodiment, relates to a method of growing crystalline or poly-<br>
crystalline sheet material. As used herein, the term crystalline refers to single crystal,<br>
polycrystalline and semi-crystalline materials. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is<br>
practiced with string ribbon or edge-stabilized ribbon wherein strings or fibers are used to<br>
stabilize the edges of the ribbon by capillary attachment. This method allows for the growth<br>
of ribbons, including continuous ribbons, directly from the surface of the melt. The melt may<br>
be of infinite extent in directions perpendicular to the growth direction of the ribbon, which is<br>
the location of the ribbon defined by the location of the strings. The invention is described in<br>
reference to silicon, although other materials may be used. Other materials include<br>
germanium, alloys of silicon, and alloys of germanium, and generally those materials that can<br>
be produced by crystal growth from the liquid.<br>
In an existing technique for crystal growth, a crucible with walls is used to contain the<br>
molten material. When a large crucible is used, the walls of the crucible are far from the<br>
growing ribbon, and thus the ribbon behaves as though it were growing from an inrmitely<br>
large pool of melt. However, as the size of the crucible is reduced in order to reduce the cost<br>
of the process, the walls of the crucible come closer to the growing ribbon, resulting in an<br>
effect which causes the ribbon to grow in a non-flat or trough-like configuration. Such non-<br>
flat growth can also result from other factors such as a direction of pulling or withdrawal of<br>
the ribbon which is not precisely perpendicular to the surface of the melt.<br>
The present invention, in one embodiment, provides a means alternative to a<br>
conventional crucible for confining and defining the location of the melt from which the<br>
string ribbon is grown. This means is comprised of defining the edges of the pool of melt by<br>
capillary attachment to edge features of a wetted, or partially wetted material, with a<br>
substantial portion of the volume of the melt positioned above these edges. The shape of the<br>
surface of the melt on top of this "mesa" crucible without ribbon present is characteristically<br>
concave downward, in contrast to the characteristically concave upward shape of the melt<br>
surface in a conventional crucible with walls without ribbon present. Regions outside the<br>
ribbon may also be coneave-downward as well. In addition, ai will be described in more<br>
detail below, an inflection point is formed in a cross-section of the boundary profile of the<br>
melt. This inflection point creates an effect that pro-disposes the ribbon to grow flat.<br>
This effect is essentially the opposite of the effect that takes place because of the walls<br>
of a conventional crucible, wherein the ribbon is predisposed to grow in a non-flat shape.<br>
The predisposition of the ribbon to grow flat due to the concave down shape can also mitigate<br>
factors such as off-axis pulling which tends to create a non-flat ribbon. As used herein, the<br>
term "mesa" refers to a crucible which has the general form of a mesa - a generally flat top<br>
surface and steep side walls. In the case of the mesa crucible, a surface is defined by the<br>
edges of the mesa. In the preferred embodiment this surface is planar. In some embodiments,<br>
the edges of the mesa are curved or undulating. Such curvature shapes the meniscus across<br>
the width of the ribbon, may influence the nature of and propagation of grain, structure, and<br>
stress in the ribbon. Note that the surface of the crucible itself can have a slight depression,<br>
e.g., on the order of about 1 mm, as shown in FIG. 11. However, there is still a plane defined<br>
by the top edges of the mesa. In the case of a slight depression, or raised edges, the raised<br>
edges may have a land.<br>
When growing crystal ribbons from a mesa crucible, the meniscus shape is self-<br>
stabilizing, in that the growing ribbon moves back to the center in response to any<br>
perturbation. Another advantage is that the base edge of the meniscus is reasonably far from<br>
the interface between liquid and solid. This is helpful because particles can grow at the base<br>
of the meniscus where it attaches to a crucible. During the growth of a crystalline ribbon in a<br>
crucible made of graphite (the preferred practice), silicon carbide particles can grow, and if<br>
any oxygen is present, silicon oxide particles can grow. These particles can disturb the<br>
flatness and structure of the growing crystals and can even interrupt the growth. As the base<br>
edge of the meniscus is reasonably from the growth interface when using a mesa, crucible, the<br>
impact of such particles is minimized.<br>
As a consequence of this concave down melt surface shape and its effect of leading to<br>
the growth of flat ribbon, the edges of the melt pool may be brought into close proximity with<br>
the ribbon and the size of the melt pool minimized. The small size of the melt pool, in<br>
combination with the lack of need for walls of the crucible, leads to a dramatic reduction in<br>
the amount of crucible material needed and in the expense associated with machining it into<br>
shape. In addition, less power is needed to keep the melt pool and mesa crucible at the proper<br>
temperature. These factors result in a reduction in manufacturing cost for the ribbon<br>
produced. At the same time, the "flattening" effect induced by the shape of the melt surface,<br>
results in flatter, higher quality ribbon. This improved ribbon flatness results in higher yields<br>
in the subsequent handling of the ribbon. Another advantage of the mesa crucible approach is<br>
that it can be scaled to the growth of multiple ribbons from a single crucible by further<br>
elongating the crucible<br>
With the conventional practice of string ribbon, the ribbon is grown from a pool of<br>
melt that is large enough in horizontal extent that it appears to be infinite in extent to the<br>
growing ribbon. In such a case, the meniscus that forms between the melt and the growth<br>
interface has a shape which is determined by capillary and the height of this interface above<br>
the free melt surface. The curvature is calculated using the Laplace Equation:<br><br>
Where AP is the pressure difference across the interface between liquid and gas (the meniscus<br>
surface), y is the surface tension of the liquid, and R1 aad R2 are the principal radii of<br>
curvature of the meniscus.<br>
The pressure difference across the interface between liquid and gas at a given point on<br>
this interface can be found from the height of this point above the "free melt surface." At the<br>
free melt surface, the curvature of the liquid/gas interface is zero, and there is ho pressure<br>
drop across the liquid/gas interface. As the meniscus is above the free melt surface, the<br>
pressure within it is lower than in the gas surrounding it. The pressure difference across the<br>
interface between liquid and gas at a height y above the free melt surface is given by:<br><br>
Where g is the acceleration of gravity, and p is the density of molten silicon.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a flat ribbon 1 growing perpendicularly from a free melt surface 3. The<br>
drawing is roughly to scale and the ribbon is 500 microns. This is thicker than a typical<br>
ribbon, which might range from about 200-300 microns thick, but the higher value is used to<br>
aid in illustration. Further, the concept can be used over a wide range, including the growth<br>
of thin ribbon of 30-100 micron thickness as might be useful for lower cost, higher efficiency<br>
and/or flexible solar cells. For the case of a flat ribbon, one of the principal radii of curvature<br>
of equation (1) is infinite (for example, R2 is taken to be infinite). A numerical calculation<br>
may be done using a technique such as the Finite Difference method, to calculate the<br>
eurvature of the monisous at each point along its surface, and integrate the resulting shaps.<br>
This calculation can be conveniently started at the interface 5 between solid and liquid silicon<br>
using as an initial position the known equilibrium angle 7 between the solid and liquid silicon<br>
at the growth interface of 11°. A guess is made as to where the interface is and the numerical<br>
calculation produces the shape of the meniscus. The guess is refined until the proper<br>
boundary condition Is met at the surface of the malt—that la that the menisoua reaches the<br>
height of the pre-melt surface with a slope of 0 (horizontal). By using such a technique, it can<br>
be found that at the center of a wide silicon ribbon, the height of the interface above the melt<br>
surface is approximately 7.10 mm. FIG. 1 is a scale drawing of the shape of the meniscus<br>
calculated by such a finite difference method.<br>
Alternatively, an approximate method can be employed wherein the curvature of the<br>
meniscus is assumed to be constant and have a value of R' (and not be a function of the<br>
height above the free melt surface). A further approximation is made that the equilibrium<br>
angle between solid and liquid silicon is 0°. Thus, the height of the meniscus will be equal to<br>
the magnitude of the radius of curvature of the meniscus, R', as illustrated in FIG. 2 (again for<br>
the case of a ribbon of thickness 500 microns). A final approximation takes the pressure drop<br>
across the liquid/gas interface to be equal to that present at half the height of the meniscus.<br>
Substituting a value of R'/2 for y in equation 2, we find that ?P=pgR'/2 (the pressure within<br>
the meniscus is lower than outside the meniscus). Substituting this value of ?P and a value<br>
of R'/2 for R1 in equation 1 we obtain:<br><br>
Re-arranging equation 3 and using s to represent the meniscus height, we obtain:<br><br>
Where a is defined as y/pg, for convenience.<br>
Substituting values of y=0.7 N/m, p- 2300 kg/m3, and 9.8 m/sec2 for the acceleration<br>
of gravity, g for molten silicon, we find that this approximate analysis produces a meniscus<br>
height of 7.88 mm. Thus, the approximate analysis produces a result fairly close to that of the<br>
numerical analysis. These two methods will be used with modification to describe the current<br>
invention below.<br>
During growth, string ribbon can be subject to some influences that lead to growth<br>
conditions, which are less than ideal. For example, if the device pulling the ribbon (the<br>
fuller") is located at a position slightly displaced from directly above the region where the<br>
ibbon grows, the ribbon will be pulled at a slight angle with respect to the melt.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a series of drawings depicting a close-up of the upper region of the<br>
meniscus, the lower region of the growing ribbon and the interface between liquid and solid.<br>
The drawings are approximately to scale for silicon ribbon growing from a melt surface. The<br>
scale of the drawings is approximately 10:1 (the drawings are shown approximately 10x<br>
larger than actual size) with a ribbon thickness of 0.5 mm. The position of the free melt<br>
surface is shown in FIG. 3, although the scale of the drawing does not allow for the menisci to<br>
be drawn all the way down to this level without many lines crossing over each other and<br>
rendering the drawing difficult to interpret.<br>
In FIG. 3a the ribbon 1 is shown growing vertically from the melt 3, much as: in FIG.<br>
1. FIG. 3b shows the ribbon as it grows when pulled at an angle of 10 degrees from the<br>
vertical, with consideration of only the physics governing the shape of the meniscus and its<br>
interface to the growing ribbon. Note that 10 degrees is an extreme angle - much larger than<br>
an angle that might be encountered due to a misaligned puller and is chosen for purposes of<br>
illustration. Not considered in FIG. 3b are the heat transfer considerations discussed below.<br>
These heat transfer considerations will force the ribbon to grow differently than shown in<br>
FIG. 3b. Note that in FIG. 3b, the meniscus height 100 on the "underside" is higher than the<br>
meniscus height 102 on the "topside." The origin of this difference in height is that on the<br>
"underside" the meniscus must be allowed to reach a greater height in order to curve over and<br>
meet the ribbon at the thermodynamically determined angle at the interface. The result is that<br>
the interface between liquid and solid 104 is inclined at a steep angle with respect to the<br>
ribbon. This situation can be modeled by the integration of the Laplace equation, as<br>
discussed above, but this time the initial angle conditions have changed. Thus, if the ribbon<br>
is being pulled at an angle of 10° from the vertical, the angle of the meniscus surface on the<br>
"underside" meniscus is an angle of 1° from the vertical where the meniscus meets the ribbon<br>
(the equilibrium solid-liquid angle of 11 degrees - the pulling angle of 10 degrees). The<br>
angle of meniscus surface for the "topside" meniscus is an angle of 21° from the vertical<br>
where the meniscus meets the ribbon (the equilibrium solid-liquid angle of 11 degrees + the<br>
pulling angle of 10 degrees). The change in meniscus height due to pulling at an angle from<br>
the vertical may be related to the pulling angle as follows:<br><br>
Where As is the change in meniscus height from the value when pulling vertical ribbon, r is<br>
the radius of curvature at the top of the meniscus and ? is the angle of pulling, measured from<br>
the vertical. The radius of curvature of the meniscus at the top of the meniscus is found from<br>
the Laplace equation at a height s above the free melt surface (r = y/pgs). In this approximate<br>
result, the equilibrium angle of 11° between solid and liquid silicon is ignored. For the case<br>
of pulling at 10 degrees from the vertical, equation 5 gives As = 0.78 mm. Thus, the<br>
meniscus on the "underside" is higher by 0.78 mm than the meniscus for vertical ribbon,<br>
while the meniscus on the "topside" is 0.78 mm lower than the meniscus for vertical ribbon.<br>
A very similar result may be obtained using the finite difference numerical approach<br>
described above, starting with different boundary conditions for the angle of meniscus at the<br>
top of the meniscus.<br>
However, as noted above, heat transfer considerations will not allow the situation of<br>
FIG. 3b to persist. Note that FIG. 3c shows the direction and approximate magnitudes of the<br>
heat fluxes up the ribbon and out its surfaces. Note that there is a significant flux from the<br>
interface to the "topside" 106 of the ribbon (there must be, as the interface is, by definition, at<br>
the melting point of silicon and the surface of the ribbon is cooler). However, since the two<br>
sides of the ribbon lose approximately the same amount of heat to the environment (the<br>
inclination of the ribbon may allow the topside to loose a bit more heat, but not much), there<br>
is no way that the higher heat fluxes moving from the interface to the top surface of the<br>
ribbon can be supported. As a consequence, the extra heat arriving at the top surface will<br>
tend to melt the ribbon back, leading to an increase of the meniscus height at the topside of<br>
the ribbon. An analogous argument leads to the conclusion that the ribbon on the underside<br>
108 will be caused to temporarily grow faster than in the case of vertically pulled ribbon,<br>
leading to a decrease in the height of the meniscus on the underside of the ribbon, as follows.<br>
The inclination of the interface of FIG. 3b leads to heat being conducted toward the topside of<br>
the ribbon. Less heat is directed toward the underside of the ribbon than for vertical growth<br>
of ribbons. The ribbon will therefore solidify faster on this side and the meniscus height will<br>
decrease. An this manner, thermal considerations force the meniscus to look more like that<br>
shown in FIG. 3d where the meniscus heights are closer to equal on top and bottom sides, as<br>
compared with the situation of FIG. 3c. However, the situation of FIG. 3d cannot persist as<br>
the equilibrium requirements of the angle of the melt with respect to the growing solid is not<br>
satisfied.<br>
The meniscus of FIG. 3d forces the ribbon to grow at an angle different from that of<br>
the pulling direction for a transient period. The direction of growth is determined by a chain<br>
of effects. Laplace's equation determines the shape of the meniscus. Thermal conditions<br>
influence the height of the meniscus. The height in combination with the shape determines<br>
the angle of the meniscus at its top (where it meets the solid silicon). The liquid and solid<br>
silicon must maintain the equilibrium angle of 11 degrees at the interface. The angle of the<br>
ribbon surface is thus determined. FIG. 3e shows the pulling direction as a dotted line and<br>
shows the ribbon 110 growing at less of an angle with respect to the vertical (less than the<br>
angle of the pulling direction). As a consequence, the ribbon advances over the surface of the<br>
melt in the direction of the arrow shown in FIG. 3e. This growth is toward the side of the<br>
ribbon that has the higher meniscus. This is a general result applicable to situations other<br>
than pulling a ribbon at an angle to the melt. The Tesult is that any situation that tends to<br>
cause the meniscus on one side of the ribbon to be higher than the meniscus on the other side,<br>
will result in the ribbon growing in a direction determined by the higher meniscus height.<br>
In the case of the ribbon which is pulled at an angle to the melt, the center portion of<br>
the ribbon is now caused to grow in the direction of the ribbon that has the higher meniscus,<br>
however, the edges of the ribbon axe fixed in place by the location of the strings. As a<br>
consequence, the ribbon 120 tends to grow in the shape of a trough from the melt 122 as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4. For small angles of pulling from the vertical, an equilibrium trough<br>
shape will be reached and maintained. The equilibrium trough shape arises from the fact that<br>
the troughing itself changes the meniscus height on the two sides of the ribbon. The<br>
curvatures of the surface of the meniscus must at all points obey Laplace's equation, equation<br>
1. As noted previously, in the case of a flat ribbon, one of the principal radii of curvature, R2,<br>
is infinite in extent, and therefore drops out of Equation 1. However, when the ribbon grows<br>
as a trough, the concave side of the ribbon (the topside in FIG. 4) now has a finite value of R2,<br>
and it is of the same sign as R1. As a consequence, R1 must increase (in magnitude) from the<br>
value it has for a flat ribbon. On the convex side of the ribbon, i.e., the underside in FIG. 4,<br>
the troughing results in a finite value of R2, but one that is of sign opposite to R1, As a<br>
consequence, R1 must assume a value smaller in magnitude than that for a flat ribbon. The<br>
result is that the troughing results in a shorter meniscus on the convex side (corresponding to<br>
the underside of a ribbon pulled at an angle to the melt), and a higher meniscus on the<br>
concave side (corresponding to the topside of a ribbon pulled at an angle to the melt). The<br>
changes in meniscus height due to troughing result in changes in menisoua height, which<br>
counteract the effect of pulling at an angle.<br>
The constant curvature approximate method used to arrive at the approximation of<br>
Equations 3 and 4 can be extended to the case of troughing. In this derivation, the ribbon will<br>
be examined in a snapshot where it is growing vertically from the surface of the melt, but<br>
with a trough. While such a situation will not persist, the relationship between troughing and<br>
meniscus height will be easiest to analyze for this case. As in the derivation of equation 3, R'<br>
is the radius of curvature of the meniscus in the vertical plane. For convenience, R', which is<br>
concave, is taken to be positive in value. In this case, R* is the radius of curvature of the<br>
trough (which can assume both positive and negative values). Again, the pressure drop across<br>
the meniscus is taken to be that at half the meniscus height. Further, under the approximation<br>
that the liquid meets the solid with no discontinuity in angle, the meniscus height is equal to<br>
R'. Thus,<br><br>
The first term in equation 7 is the meniscus height for the case of vertical ribbon<br>
growth. The second term is the change in meniscus height due to troughing. As noted above,<br>
the concave side of the trough (positive value of R*) experiences an increase in meniscus<br>
height, while the convex side experiences a decrease in meniscus height. This problem may<br>
also be treated by the numerical method, and these predictions match the approximate results<br>
of Equation 7 with good accuracy.<br>
The growth of the ribbon in the shape of a trough is a response to pulling off-angle<br>
and can lead to a stable growth situation for small angles of pulling. The chain of events<br>
begins by pulling at an angle to the vertical. This alters the shape of meniscus. However,<br>
thermal effects enter and cause the ribbon to grow in the direction of the higher meniscus.<br>
The center of the ribbon can move, but the edges cannot, and a trough results. The troughing<br>
in turn, alters the shape of the meniscus so as to lower the meniscus height on the underside<br>
of the ribbon and raise it on the topside - the exact opposite of the effect of pulling an angle<br>
from the vertical. If the angle of pulling is small (close to the vertical), the trough may be<br>
sufficient to completely counteract the effect of pulling off-angle and result in meniscus<br>
heights that are approximately equal on the two sides of the ribbon.<br>
For a ribbon 124 of width w, we can relate the troughing radius, R*, to the depth of the<br>
trough, 5, as illustrated in FIG. 5 (which shows a vertical view of a cross-section through the<br>
ribbon) as follows:<br><br>
As an example, if we pull a ribbon at an angle of 1° from the vertical, we can use<br>
equation 5 to calculate that meniscus height on the topside of the ribbon will decrease by<br>
approximately 78 microns, while that on the bottom of the ribbon will increase by<br>
approximately 78 microns. The center of the ribbon will move in the direction of the higher<br>
meniscus and the ribbon will grow in the shape of a trough. The trough will deepen until the<br>
change in meniscus height predicted by equation 7 counteracts the change predicted by<br>
equation 5. The result will be a trough of radius R* = 0.4 m. If the width of the ribbon is 60<br>
mm, for example, the depth of the trough maybe calculated from equation 8 as 1.1 mm, a<br>
significant deviation from flatness. The trough deepens as the ribbon width increases<br>
according to equation 8.<br>
In any real system, there will always be some errors or noises in the system resulting,<br>
for example, in the ribbon being pulled at a slight angle with respect to the vertical. As can<br>
be seen from this discussion, in order to compensate for such disturbances, the ribbon<br>
responds by deviating from the desired condition of a flat ribbon. The tendency of the<br>
troughing to cause a restoration of flatness may be thought of as something analogous to a<br>
restoring force from a spring which is pulled from an equilibrium position. This "restoring"<br>
tendency may be quantitatively expressed as the change in meniscus height for one side of the<br>
ribbon that is induced by a displacement of the ribbon center from its flat position. Thus, for<br>
the case of a trough-shaped growth of the ribbon, this restoring force may be expressed as:<br>
Using equation 7 in the numerator and equation 8 in the denominator:<br><br>
For Silicon ribbon of width w = 56 mm, the Restoring tendency from equation 9A has<br>
a value of 0.08. Thus for a case where a 56 mm wide ribbon grows in a trough shape with a<br>
depth of the trough of 1 mm, the meniscus height on the concave side will rise by 0.08 mm<br>
and on the convex side will fall by 0.08 mm. Silicon ribbons with a width of 81.2mm may<br>
also be grown with the result of a lower "Restoring Tendency."<br>
When the ribbon begins to grow in a non-flat configuration, new disturbances may be<br>
introduced. For example, when a trough-shaped ribbon enters the pulling device, may exert<br>
bending moments on the ribbon resulting in further disturbances to the growth. The analysis<br>
presented here is intended to provide understanding about the basic aspects of the process.<br>
It should be understood that prior to the current invention, observations were made<br>
relating the axis of the pulling of the ribbon to its tendency to grow in a trough-shaped curve.<br>
However, neither the physical mechanisms, nor a quantitative understanding of this<br>
phenomenon is known.<br>
In a practical system, it is important to rmnimize the size of the crucible and the melt<br>
pool. Minimizing this size reduces the consumable material used, such as the graphite used<br>
for the crucible. Further, the time required to machine the crucible is reduced. Further, the<br>
energy required to operate the furnace will be minimized.<br>
The desirable case then is to make the crucible 130 narrower - that is to bring the<br>
crucible walls 132 close to the plane of the ribbon 134 being pulled from the melt 136, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6a. However, this arrangement leads to a situation where the ribbon is less<br>
likely to stay flat, or, in the limit, cannot stay flat. FIG. 6b illustrates what happens as the<br>
ribbon 134 moves off-center and therefore closer to one wall 138 than to the other wall 140.<br>
The boundary condition that is maintained at the wall is that the wetting angle of the<br>
meniscus to the wall of the crucible stays constant. In essence, the capillary attachment to the<br>
walls of the crucible causes an upward force on the meniscus. As the ribbon gets closer to one<br>
wall, this upward force has more effect on this side of the ribbon, resulting in a meniscus<br>
height which is higher on that side. The numerical approach described above can be extended<br>
to this case. For example, with a crucible that has a separation between walls of 60 mm, if<br>
the ribbon moves off center by 1 mm, the difference in the height of the meniscus from one<br>
side of the ribbon to the other will be approximately 15 microns. This effect may be<br>
expressed with the same sort of ratio used to describe the stabilizing effect of the troughing<br>
above. In this case (for reasons discussed below), it is a destabilizing effect which is<br>
expressed as the ratio of the change of meniscus height for one side of the ribbon, to the<br>
change in the distance of the ribbon to the crucible wall. Table I tabulates this destabilizing<br>
effect for different crucible widths. The relevant dimension is the dimension between the<br>
ribbon and the inside wall of the crucible.<br><br>
The effect is a destabilizing effect because, as the ribbon moves toward a wall, the<br>
meniscus height on the side of the ribbon closer to that wall increases, while the meniscus<br>
height on the side of the ribbon further from the wall decreases. The heat transfer internal to<br>
the ribbon causes the ribbon to grow in the direction of the higher meniscus, as described<br>
above. This results in the continued growth of the ribbon towards the closer wall. This<br>
growth will continue in this direction until reaching the wall. Thus we see that the growth in<br>
the configuration of a trough-shaped ribbon is a stabilizing effect, while bringing a. crucible<br>
wall closer to the plane of the ribbon is a destabilizing effect. Both effects are proportional to<br>
the distance that the center of the ribbon moves from the original growth plane, at least for<br>
small distances.<br>
If these two effects are equal in magnitude, they will cancel each other, resulting in no<br>
predisposition of the ribbon to grow either toward the wall of the crucible or flat. As noted<br>
earlier, the Restoring Tendency for a 56mm wide ribbon is 0.08. Thus, for this ribbon width,<br>
the effects will oanoel each other at a ribbon-crucible wall value of somewhere between 15<br>
and 20 mm. If the destabilizing effect from a nearby crucible wall is larger, the ribbon will<br>
tend to grow into a trough and continue to worsen in flatness. If the stabilizing effect from<br>
troughing is larger (corresponding to crueible wall that is far away), the ribbon will, in<br>
principle, grow flat. The destabilizing influence of the crucible walls may reduce the ability<br>
of the ribbon to reject disturbances such as pulling off the vertical. A 81.2 mm ribbon is<br>
grown from a wider crucible for stability.<br>
In summary, bringing crucible walls in towards the plane of the ribbon, while having<br>
the potential of improving the economics of the process, has the deleterious effect of leading<br>
to ribbon which is less flat.<br>
If the free melt surface (surface of the molten silicon with no ribbon present) is shaped<br>
convex-up, it can be shown that a flatness stabilizing effect is produced on the growing<br>
ribbon.<br>
In one embodiment, this convex-up or concave-down shape is produced by using a<br>
crucible with walls that are non-wetted by the molten silicon. A non-wetting wall is defined<br>
as one which has a contact angle greater than 90°. By analogy, a pool of mercury contained in<br>
a glass vessel will have a free liquid surface that is convex-up due to the fact that molten<br>
mercury does not wet glass. The entire crucible may be made of such non-wetted material, or<br>
small pieces of non-wetted material may be inserted into the wall of the crucible where the<br>
melt wets the wall. For example in the case of molten silicon, Pyrolitic Boron Nitride can be<br>
used as a non-wetted material.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the concave-down shape is created by<br>
disposing all of or a portion of the melt above the wetted edges and allowing gravity in<br>
combination with capillarity to determine the shape of the free melt surface. FIG. 7 shows a<br>
cross-section through a flat sheet of wetted material 300 with a pool of molten silicon 302 on<br>
top. The wetted sheet is an example of a "mesa" crucible that contains melt on its surface<br>
without walls. Rather, the melt is contained by capillarity and is substantially above the<br>
wetted edges of the mesa 304. This silicon wets the edges of the sheet while the shape of the<br>
melt is determined by capillary action in the presence of the gravity field. The outside walls<br>
of the mesa crucible can be vertical as shown in FIG. 7a or can be disposed at a different<br>
angle as shown in FIG. 7b. A re-entrant angle such as that shown in FIG. 7b provides for<br>
greater resistance to the melt spilling over the side of the crucible, but may be less convenient<br>
for fabrication and somewhat less durable. A shallower angle is also possible, but is less<br>
resistant to melt spilling than even the vertical side walls. The edge of the meniscus is stable<br>
over a wide range of melt heights and melt volumes in part due to the ability of the meniscus<br>
to assume a wide range of angles at the edge of the mesa, as is also shown in FIG. 9, which is<br>
described below. FIG. 7c. shows a detail of one edge of the mesa crucible of FIG 7a. Note<br>
that the edge need not be a perfectly abrupt angle, but rather can have a radius as in FIG. 7c.<br>
In fact, in general the crucible will have such a radius, even if machined as a "hard" angle -<br>
albeit at a small scale. Further, if it is found to be advantageous for manufacturing cost or<br>
durability, a radius can be deliberately machined into the crucible. The spot or location of the<br>
meniscus on the radius is determined by satisfying the wetting angle condition between the<br>
liquid and the material of the crucible. In the case of FIG. 7c, this angle is approximately 30<br>
degrees - a typical angle for a wetting system.<br>
The Finite Difference numerical method of calculating the meniscus shape, els<br>
described above, may be extended to calculate the shape of the free melt surface on this mesa<br>
crucible in the absence of a ribbon. For a given width of mesa, a height of melt at the center<br>
of the mesa is assumed. This height is measured from the plane defined by the edges of the<br>
mesa. Next, a guess is made as to radius of curvature of the melt at the top center of the<br>
mesa. The shape of the melt is then calculated. Iteration is performed until the melt passes<br>
through the edge of the mesa. For example, if the radius at the top center is assumed too<br>
large, the first iteration will produce a result where the melt surface passes over the edge. A<br>
second iteration can then be done with a smaller radius of curvature. There is no need to<br>
match a particular angle at the point where the meniscus intercepts the edge of the mesa as the<br>
liquid can assume a wide range of angles at this point. Indeed, this is part of what makes the<br>
mesa crucible stable over a wide range of conditions. This type of analysis can be repeated<br>
with different widths of mesa and different heights of melt. The pool of melt atop the mesa<br>
may be stable for a wide range of melt height. The limits to stability stem from the angle of<br>
wetting of the liquid at the edge of the mesa. If the melt pool is too shallow, the angle of<br>
wetting may be smaller than the equilibrium wetting angle on the mesa material, and the pool<br>
may shrink in away from the edge. In FIGS. 11 and 12, both described below in more detail,<br>
a recess is created in the crucible, which substantially reduces this danger. If the pool is too<br>
deep, the wall of the pool will exceed the vertical at the edge, and be prone to instability.<br>
Although in principal the wall of the pool may somewhat exceed the vertical at the edge (for<br>
example, in FIG. 7b), this is not the preferred embodiment. For example, for a mesa with a<br>
total width of 60 mm (30 mm from each face of the ribbon), the mesa will hold silicon until<br>
the silicon reaches a height of approximately 8 mm above the plane defined by the edges of<br>
the mesa. For a mesa with a total width of 20 mm, the mesa will hold silicon until the silicon<br>
reaches a height of approximately 6mm above the plane defined by the edges of the mesa.<br>
PIG. 7 shows the shape of the pool of molten silicon on a mesa of total width 20mm in a case<br>
where the height of the melt at the center is 5 mm.<br>
Table II shows tabulations for two mesa widths and two heights of melt. For each of<br>
the four combinations, four calculations are tabulated. "Angle" refers to the angle of the<br>
meniscus where it meets the edge of the mesa, measured from the horizontal. "Radius of<br>
Curvature" refers to the radius of curvature of the melt at the top of the meniscus, which over<br>
the center of the mesa. "Pressure" refers to the pressure difference across the meniscus at the<br>
top of the meniscus and it is calculated from the Laplace equation using the radius; of<br>
curvature of the meniscus at the top of the mesa. "Height, ambient Press" is explained below.<br>
Table II. Four characteristics of a Melt on a Mesa with no Ribbon in Place For<br>
Four Combinations of Melt Height and Mesa Width<br><br>
FIG. 8 shows a growing ribbon 800 in place, growing from the pool on top of a mesa<br>
crucible 802. Note that string introduction tubes 804, as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,627,887, have been inserted on the bottom of the mesa crucible to allow for the strings 806<br>
defining the edges to come up through the bottom of the crucible. The Finite Difference<br>
numerical method described above can be used to calculate the shape of the liquid meniscus<br>
808 on top of the mesa. In this calculation, the width of the mesa is taken as a given. The<br>
Finite Difference calculation starts from growth interface and propagates toward the edge of<br>
the mesa. At the growth interface, the equilibrium angle between liquid and solid silicon of<br>
11° is from the vertical is assumed. An initial guess is made as to the height of the interface<br>
above the edge of the mesa.<br>
A final piece of information is needed for this calculation - the pressure inside the<br>
meniscus at some identified height. This is contrasted with the case of the infinite melt pool<br>
where the surface far from the ribbon has no curvature and that the liquid immediately under<br>
it is therefore at the same pressure as the ambient gas. A convenient approach is to take the<br>
height in the liquid silicon at which the pressure is equal to the ambient pressure. As noted<br>
above in the discussion of the mesa crucible with no ribbon growing, the curvature at the top<br>
of the free melt surface results in an internal pressure in the liquid at the top of the melt pool.<br>
Thus, the elevation in the melt pool at which the pressure is equal to the ambient may be<br>
calculated by taking the height of the free melt surface outside the region in which the ribbon<br>
is growing, and adding to it the height of silicon required to drop the pressure to ambient.<br>
This height is tabulated in Table II and identified as "Height, Ambient Press." For example,<br>
for the case of the mesa width of 20 mm and the melt height of 5 mm, the pressure difference<br>
caused by the curvature at the top of the melt is 38.8 Pascal. This is equivalent to 1.7 mm of<br>
silicon. Therefore, a column of liquid silicon 5+1.7 = 6.7 mm tall is required at ambient<br>
pressure.<br>
The numerical solution may now be iterated by choosing starting values of meniscus<br>
height until the meniscus passes through the edge of the mesa. FIGs. 9A through 9D show<br>
four different meniscus geometries corresponding to two widths of mesa and two different<br>
melt heights. These plots show the meniscus height as a function of horizontal position from<br>
the surface of the ribbon. Note that in each case, the surface of the meniscus has a point of<br>
inflection, that is a point at which the curvature changes from concave down (near the mesa<br>
edge) to concave down (near the growth interface). The inflection point is formed in the<br>
cross-sectional boundary profile of the melt as the crystalline ribbon is pulled. In the plots of<br>
Figure 9, the vertical axis represents a face of the ribbon (these plots assume that the ribbon is<br>
very thin with respect to the width of the mesa). Accordingly, the intercept of the meniscus<br>
profile with the vertical axis always has the equilibrium value of 11 degrees required by a<br>
growing silicon crystal. The intercept of the profile with the horizontal axes occurs at the<br>
edge of the mesa. Note that this angle is different for each of the four plots of Figure 9. The<br>
attachment at the edge allows for a wide range of angles and this is what makes the liquid<br>
pool atop the mesa stable over a range of wide melt heights.<br>
Growth from the mesa results in flatess stabilizing affect. Any motion of the<br>
ribbon away from the center of the mesa will result in a tendency to grow back toward the<br>
center. As the ribbon is perturbed from the center of the mesa, one face of the ribbon will be<br>
closer to one edge of the mesa while the other face will be further from its corresponding<br>
edge. The face that is closer will have a lower equilibrium meniscus height while the face<br>
that is further will have a higher equilibrium meniscus height. As before, thermal effects<br>
coupled with the shape of the meniscus will cause the ribbon to grow in the direction defined<br>
by the higher meniscus. Thus, growth from a mesa results in a restoring force causing ribbon<br>
to grow flat and centered on the mesa.<br>
We can attain a qualitative understanding for reduction of the equilibrium meniscus<br>
height on a face that comes closer to an edge of the mesa by examining two factors. First, the<br>
free surface of the melt on the top of the mesa drops as the edge is approached. Second the<br>
angle of the free surface changes as the edge is approached. This angle can be considered as a<br>
boundary condition where the meniscus joins the free melt surface and the effect of this<br>
change in boundary condition is also to lower the equilibrium meniscus height.<br>
The flatness stabilizing effect of the mesa may be calculated from the numerical<br>
solution by calculating the equilibrium meniscus height for a ribbon centered on the mesa and<br>
for a ribbon displaced slightly off center. Table HI tabulates the restoring force Circulated by<br>
these means. The restoring force is defined in the same manner as above, the change in<br>
meniscus height As for one side of the ribbon as the ribbon moves off-center, divided by the<br>
distance that the ribbon has moved off-center.<br><br>
Table III shows this restoring tendency for the same four cases as are tabulated in<br>
Table II. The melt height is that height in a region of the melt on the mesa well away from<br>
the growing ribbon. Two values are given in each cell; the "restoring tendency" as described<br>
above and the height above the mesa at which the pressure in the melt is the same as the<br>
ambient (this is the same as that in Table II).<br>
Table HI. The Restoring tendency for four combinations of Mesa width and Height of<br>
Melt<br><br>
As may be seen from Table ID, the restoring tendency is a strong function of the width<br>
of the mesa and increases as the width of the mesa decreases. In fact, the restoring tendency<br>
due to the mesa can easily exceed the restoring force that the ribbon can induce by growing in<br>
a trough. For example, the restoring tendency due to troughing of a 56 mm wide ribbon is<br>
0.08. However, the restoring tendency for a 20 mm wide mesa is 0.159, for the case of the<br>
Height of Melt above Mesa far from Ribbon = 5mm - as may be seen by reference to Table<br>
III. Thus, the mesa induced restoring tendency is a very substantial effect leading to the<br>
growth of a flatter ribbon. Further, the restoring tendency due to the mesa does not change<br>
with the width of the ribbon. In contrast, the restoring tendency due to troughing decreases as<br>
the ribbon width increases. Thus, the mesa may be used to grow flat, wide ribbon. Note,<br>
that the restoring tendencies of the mesa and the troughing effect add, further promoting the<br>
growth of flat ribbon.<br>
As can be seen by reference to Table III, the "restoring tendency" varies with both the<br>
width of the mesa and the "Height of Melt above Mesa far from ribbon." For convenience<br>
the "Height of Melt above Mesa far from ribbon" will be referred to simply as the Melt<br>
Height in this discussion. The restoring tendency increases as the width of the mesa is<br>
decreased and as the malt height t increase. The choice of the width of the mesa is made as<br>
a compromise. A narrower mesa will lead to a greater restoring tendency and better ribbon<br>
flatness. A wider mesa will place the edges and any particles that accumulate at the edges<br>
further from the growth interface. A suitable compromise is a mesa width of 20mm. The<br>
choice of Melt Height is also made at a compromise. A higher value of Melt Height leads to<br>
a higher restoring tendency. However, a lower value of Melt Height provides a greater<br>
margin of safety against melt spilling over the edge of the mesa - especially in the went of<br>
ribbon or ribbons detaching from the melt with the liquid content of their menisci<br>
redistributing itself along the mesa. A suitable height above the melt is l-3mm. Note that<br>
ribbon growth from a mesa is even stable with a melt height of zero (for example in the case<br>
of a 20mm mesa, the restoring tendency for this condition is approximately 0.055). In fact,<br>
for a 20mm mesa, the melt height can go slightly negative (a bit over 1mm) before the ribbon<br>
becomes unstable from a flatness point of view. This provides a margin of safety during<br>
manufacturing if temporary interruptions of melt replenishment are encountered during<br>
growth (resulting in drawdown of the melt height). However, this is not the preferred mode<br>
of operation as the flatness stabilization is much compromised. Even when the mesa is<br>
practiced with a slightly negative melt height (below the plane defined by the edges of the<br>
mesa), during growth, any detachment of ribbon will result in redistribution of the liquid in<br>
the meniscus of the growing ribbon and in an increase in the melt height, typically to a<br>
positive value.<br>
Another concern centers on the volume of liquid contained in the meniscus and the<br>
effect of a detachment of the meniscus. Periodically, the meniscus may detach from the<br>
growing ribbon, and drop down. This might occur for example if the puller momentarily<br>
pulls at a higher rate than desired. There is a significant volume of molten silicon in the<br>
meniscus, which will fall into the melt pool on the top of the mesa. The mesa crucible must<br>
be able to tolerate such a detachment and accommodate the additional molten silicon that<br>
previously was contained within the meniscus. A necessary but not sufficient condition is<br>
that the mesa be able to accommodate the volume of silicon after it has reached a quiescent<br>
stage. This condition may be calculated by calculating the volume of the liquid under the<br>
growing ribbon, and calculating the volume of the free melt surface after it redistributes itself.<br>
For example, the volume of silicon contained in the meniscus of a ribbon growing from a 20<br>
mm wide mesa in the case where the height of the melt far from the ribbon is 2 mm (the case<br>
of FIG. 9a) is 0.76 cubic centimeters per centimeter of ribbon width. However, a 20 mm<br>
wide mesa can hold molten silicon at a height of up to approximately 6mm, at which point the<br>
volume of melt is approximately 0.95 cubic centimeters per centimeter of mesa length. Thus,<br>
if the meniscus of the ribbon collapses, the mesa can accommodate the additional melt. This<br>
calculation is for the extreme case where the ribbon extends for the full length of the mesa.<br>
Ordinarily there will be additional mesa area outside of the growing ribbon that will be able to<br>
further accommodate the melt from a collapsed meniscus. Note, that if the melt height during<br>
growth is too close to the maximum height that a mesa can hold, the melt from a collapsed<br>
meniscus will result in spillage over the side of the mesa.<br>
A more stringent condition results from the fact that when the meniscus collapses as<br>
the detached meniscus falls, the fluid within it, acquires some velocity. The momentum of<br>
this fluid then initiates a small wave and this wave propagates to the edge of the mesa. The<br>
mesa must be able to absorb the shock of this wave without spilling over the edge.<br>
Experimentally it has been found that the mesa is quite resistant to this wave shock. This<br>
may be due to the fact that the meniscus does not detach across the full width of the ribbon<br>
simultaneously, but rather the detachment begins at one point and propagates across the<br>
ribbon width. The impact of this detachment is thus minimized.<br>
Another use of the flatness stabilization aspect of the mesa is to mitigate or<br>
completely compensate for the destabilizing effect of inadvertently pulling the ribbon at an<br>
angle from the vertical. As noted earlier, pulling at an angle from the vertical from an large<br>
melt pool will result in an increase in the meniscus height on the underside of the ribbon,<br>
which will in turn result in the center of the ribbon growing toward the direction of the pull<br>
and a trough shaped ribbon, as shown in FIG. 4. On a large melt pool, this trough will only<br>
stabilize once it has reached a significant depth and the difference in curvatures of the two<br>
sides of the ribbon is enough to equalize the meniscus heights on the two sides of the ribbon.<br>
However, the mesa brings a strong stabilizing factor into play as the motion of the center of<br>
the ribbon away from the center of the mesa will raise the meniscus on the side of the ribbon<br>
closer to the center and lower it on the side further from the center. This effect quickly leads<br>
to the equalization of the meniscus heights on the two sides of the ribbon with only a small<br>
deviation of the center of the ribbon from the flat condition.<br>
However, it is possible to achieve an even higher degree of flatness in the presence of<br>
unintentional pulling at an angle from the melt. If, the ribbon is pulled at an angle to the melt<br>
and the position of the strings is defined by passage through an orifice, the position of growth<br>
of the ribbon will be displaced from the center of the mesa. As noted above, such<br>
displacement from the center of the mesa will cause the meniscus on the side of the ribbon<br>
closer to the center of the mesa to be higher than the meniscus on the side of the ribbon facing<br>
away from the center. However, the angle of pulling will cause the meniscus on the side<br>
closer to the center to be lower than the meniscus on the side of the ribbon facing away from<br>
the center. If the proper geometry i» selected, these two effects can cancel each other<br>
resulting in the growth of flat ribbon at an angle to the melt.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a ribbon 810 being pulled from a mesa 802 at a slight angle to the<br>
vertical and defines three relevant geometric parameters. The angle of the ribbon with respect<br>
to the vertical is denoted as ft The vertical height between the growth interface and the point<br>
of confinement of the strings 1000 is denoted as H. The third parameter is the horizontal<br>
distance between the center of the mesa and the center of the ribbon, denoted as Distance off<br>
Center. These are related as follows:<br><br>
We may relate the angle of pulling to the difference in meniscus height, As in a<br>
manner analogous to that used in Equation 5<br><br>
where r is the radius of curvature at the top of the meniscus and where b is vertical distance<br>
between the growth interface and the height at which the pressure inside the melt is the same<br>
as that in the ambient outside the liquid.<br>
Pulling at an angle from the vertical produces a destabilizing tendency - a tendency to<br>
grow into a trough. For the case where the angle of pulling can be related to the Distance off<br>
Center by equation 11, this destabilizing tendency can be defined by analogy to equation 10<br>
as:<br><br>
However, the mesa itself has a Restoring Tendency as summarized in Table HI. In a<br>
case where the Destabilizing Tendency of equation 14 is equal in magnitude to the Restoring<br>
Tendency of the mesa, the net result will be that the ribbon can grow at an angle to the melt<br>
and remain flat. Thus, an unintentional pulling at an angle to the melt will not create a trough<br>
shaped ribbon.<br>
 FIG. 11 shows an isometric view of a graphite mesa crucible. The width of the mesa<br>
crucible shown in FIG. 11 is 20 mm. In operation, silicon overfills this crucible to a typical<br>
height of approximately 1 -2 mm above the plane defined by edges 1200. The small<br>
depression in the top 1202 allow for the silicon to stay wetted to the edge even when the<br>
silicon level drops to the level of the edges 1200. While a flat top mesa might de-wet as the<br>
melt height drops, this crucible will not de-wet. The strings come up through string<br>
introduction holes 1204 and the ribbon is puled between these. The 1/4-circle cutouts in the<br>
bottom of the crucible 1208 accept heaters, one on each side of the crucible. Support ears<br>
1210 support the crucible.<br>
As described above, the mesa crucible has a top surface and edges defining a<br>
boundary of the top surface of the mesa crucible. The melt is formed on the top surface of the<br>
mesa crucible, and the edges of the melt are retained by capillary attachment to the edges of<br>
the mesa crucible. The crystalline ribbon is then pulled from the melt. In various<br>
embodiments, a seed is placed in the melt, and the seed is pulled from the melt between a pair<br>
of strings positioned along the edges of the crystalline ribbon. The melt solidifies between<br>
the pair of strings to form the crystalline ribbon. The crystalline ribbon may be continuously<br>
pulled from the melt continuously.<br>
The mesa crucible and all concepts described herein can be applied to the concurrent<br>
growth of multiple ribbons from a single furnace. In this case, the length of the crucible is<br>
increased, while maintaining the approximate width and height. FIG. 12 shows an isometric<br>
view of a graphite mesa crucible suitable for the growth of multiple ribbons, e.g., four<br>
ribbons, each of width 81.3 mm with 38.1 mm between adjacent ribbons. The mesa is<br>
defined by edges 1304 and is 20 mm wide and 650 mm long. The corners of the mesa 1314<br>
are rounded to increase the durability of the crucible and to reduce the possibility of a leak<br>
occurring at a sharp corner. There are eight string introduction holes 1302, two for each<br>
ribbon. The left-most two are annotated in the isometric drawing - corresponding to the left-<br>
most ribbon. The crucible is supported in the furnace by tangs 1300. Section 1 shows a cross<br>
section through the region between strings. This same cross section applies to the majority of<br>
the crucible. Section 2 shows a cross section through one of the eight holes used to introduce<br>
string. Recess 1306, running the full length of the mesa is approximately 1mm deep and<br>
helps to guarantee that the silicon does not de-wet from the edge. This recess also provides a<br>
bit extra depth of liquid silicon to receive the granular silicon feedstock during replenishment.<br>
Note from section 1 and section 2 that the edge of the mesa need not be a "knife-edge" but<br>
rather can have a small flat 1318 (or land) to improve its durability, as evident in "Detail A"<br>
which is an enlargement of the top-left corner of Section 1. Typically foia fiat might be<br>
0.25mm wide. Melt replenishment is accomplished by dropping granular material, in the<br>
general area marked as 1316 and generally the material will be distributed over a length of<br>
crucible of approximately 100mm in the manner previously described. The melt<br>
replenishment can be performed at one end of the crucible - as is contemplated in FIG. 12.<br>
Alternatively, the melt replenishment can be performed in the center of the crucible with two<br>
or more ribbons grown to either side. Further, the mesa need not be of a uniform width along<br>
its entire length, although uniform width does present economy of manufacture, m particular,<br>
the region in which melt replenishment is performed may be a different width, especially<br>
wider than the region where ribbon is grown. In this manner, the melt-in of feedstock will be<br>
facilitated without decreasing the "Restoring Tendency" of the mesa crucible. Cutouts 1310<br>
are to accommodate heaters. Suitable grades of graphite for use in the growth of silicon<br>
ribbon include grade G530 available from Tokai and grade R6650 available from. SGL<br>
Carbon. It will be appreciated that with a long crucible it is particularly important to have the<br>
crucible be level so that the melt will be uniformly distributed along the length and not<br>
accumulate substantially at one end. Typically the crucible is leveled to at least within 0.2<br>
mm along the length.<br>
The new charge of silicon is continually dropped in the region 1205. Typically,<br>
silicon "BB's" made by fluidized bed using the thermal decomposition of silane and provided<br>
by MEMC Corp. are used to replenish the melt continuously as ribbon is grown, although<br>
other granular forms of silicon feedstock can be used as known in the art. For "BB's", the<br>
size ranges from approximately 1 mm diameter to 4 mm diameter. FIG. 13 shows a technique<br>
to accomplish melt replenishment of a mesa crucible which minimizing the mechanical (e.g.<br>
splashing) and thermal disturbance to the system. A mesa crucible 1404 is held inside a metal<br>
furnace shell 1402 (the crucible is held by the end tangs, one of which is evident in FIG. 13,<br>
however, the supports which mate to these tangs are not shown). Insulation 1400 helps to<br>
maintain the crucible at temperature. The granular silicon feedstock will be transported into<br>
the furnace through a horizontally, or substantially horizontal tube 1406. The tube may be<br>
made of any refractory material, however, quartz tubing is a good choice for silicon crystal<br>
growth as it is chemically compatible, economical and has good resistance to thermal shock.<br>
Further, the elastic modulus of quartz is reasonably high and this is helpful as explained<br>
below. Tube 1406 is clamped into trough 1414 by clamp 1426. The frough/tube assembly is<br>
support atop a vibratory feeder 1416, such as those know in the art. The vibratory feeder can<br>
move left and right (it sits on a track, not shown, and is moved by a motor as is well know in<br>
the art). FIG. 13a shows the tube/trough/vibrator assembly in its right-most position -<br>
furthest out of the furnace. FIG. 13b shows the tube/trough/vibrator assembly in its left-most<br>
position - furthest into the furnace. Hopper 1410 is used to hold the granular feedstock,<br>
which is metered out by device 1412. Suitable methods of metering are described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,090,199 and 6,217,649. Enclosure 1418 serves to isolate the contents from air<br>
and the enclosed volume is in communication with the interior of the furnace through the hole<br>
in 1402 through which tube 1406 penetrates. FIGS. 13a and 13b show the hardware without<br>
silicon present, for clarity.<br>
FIGS. 13c and 13d illustrate the cycle used in feeding. As the tube is withdrawn from<br>
the furnace, the vibrator is turned on and the silicon feedstock is transported down the tube<br>
and falls on the melt 1420, which is atop the mesa crucible. The tube and trough move<br>
together as a single unit and the tube must be stiff enough and light enough to enforce motion<br>
as a rigid body so that the vibration will be well defined (hence the advantage of high elastic<br>
modulus). The stiffness to weight ratio of the tube can also be increase by increasing its<br>
outside diameter, while keeping the wall thickness the same. However, the tube cannot be<br>
made so large that the heat loss down the tube and out the furnace is too large or that the<br>
location of the BB's when they drop is too ill-defined to guarantee that they land on the mesa.<br>
For a 20mm wide mesa a quartz tube of 14mm OD and 1mm wall has been found suitable.<br>
The amplitude of vibration is adjusted so that the traverse time for a BB down the tube is on<br>
the same order as the time required to complete one in/out cycle, or not too much greater that<br>
this time. As long as this time is kept fairly short, the tube acts to rapidly transport the<br>
metered feedstock in and back-ups and tube plugging are prevented. At the same time, too<br>
high a vibrational amplitude will result in BB's "spraying" out the end and therefore not<br>
necessarily dropping where intended. The drop from tube to melt is small, typically 10 mm.<br>
This helps to avoid splashing and waves on the liquid silicon. It also minimizes the chance<br>
that a BB will bounce off another BB present in the melt and fall outside the mesa. The<br>
possibility of BB's falling on top of one another is further reduced by withdrawing the tube<br>
during feeding so that, for the most part, BB'a fall on clear melt Distributing the BB's along<br>
a length of the mesa also has the advantage of distributing the cooling effect of the BB's and<br>
thereby reducing the overheat needed in the crucible to melt the BB's. Note that the silicon<br>
BB's float on the surface of the melt due to the lower density of solid silicon (as compared to<br>
liquid silicon) and due to surface tension effects. The BB's may tend to stay in the center of<br>
the mesa or go to the edges, depending on factors including the ourvature of the melt and the<br>
direction of the temperature gradient across the mesa.<br>
In FIG. 13d, the tube/trough/vibrator is moving back, into the furnace with the vibrator<br>
turned off and no silicon feeding in order to minimize the number of collisions of BB's. A<br>
few BB's which remain on the melt are almost fully melted at this stage and will be fully<br>
melted by the time the tube returns to the right-most position on the next withdrawal stroke.<br>
Typically, the feeding/withdrawal stroke takes approximately 5 seconds, the return stroke<br>
approximately 1 second and the traverse time of BB's in the tube approximately 10 sec. The<br>
metering device and hopper may be fixed and need not move with the tube/trough/'vibrator.<br>
In this case, the trough needs to be long enough to capture the BB's over the fall travel.<br>
It will be appreciated that temperature control must be adequately maintained along<br>
the length of the crucible so as to grow ribbon of predictable and consistent thickness. This<br>
may be accomplished by positioning small, 'dimming" heater elements along the length of<br>
the crucible, beneath the crucible. Such methods are well known in the art of high<br>
temperature furnace design. Another method of mamtaining the temperature along the length<br>
of the crucible is to provide for movable portions of the insulation pack, which surrounds the<br>
crucible, as shown in FIG. 14. Mesa crucible 1500 is disposed within furnace shell 1504 and<br>
held in place by supports not shown. Lower insulation pack 1506 is shown, however, all<br>
insulation above the crucible has been omitted for clarity. Replenishment feed tube 1502 is<br>
shown for reference. The lower insulation pack 1506 has openings 1520. Three movable<br>
insulation elements are shown an these elements are actuated from outside the furnace by rods<br>
1508,1510, and 1512. Examining the rightmost movable element, we see a piece of<br>
insulation 1514 on top of a plate 1516 attached to actuation rod 1512. Plate 1516 acts to<br>
support the fragile insulation. The rightmost movable element is in the fully-up position,<br>
resulting in minimum heat loss. The center element is fully down, resulting in maximum heat<br>
loss. The left-most element is in the middle, resulting in an intermediate heat loss condition.<br>
The rods may be positioned by hand or by an electro-mechanical positioning mechanism as is<br>
known in the art, the latter allowing for automated control of position.<br>
The invention, as described herein, has been described in the context of String<br>
Ribbon. However, the mesa crucible can be applied to other methods of growing ribbons and<br>
sheets including, but not limited to, the Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) of crystalline<br>
ribbons. For example, a mesa crucible shaped in a closed polygon may be used to grow such<br>
a hollow, polygonal crystalline ribbon.<br>

retained by capillary attachment to edge features (304) of a crucible (300). The boundary<br>
profile (808) of the resulting melt surface results in an effect which induces a ribbon (800)<br>
grown from the surface of the melt (302) to grow as a flat body. Further, the size of the<br>
melt (302) is substantially reduced by bringing these edges (304) close to the ribbon (80),<br>
thereby reducing the materials cost and electric power cost associated with the process.<br></td>
