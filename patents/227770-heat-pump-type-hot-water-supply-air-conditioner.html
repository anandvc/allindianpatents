				<td>HEAT PUMP TYPE HOT-WATER SUPPLY AIR CONDITIONER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a heat pump type<br>
hot-water supply air conditioner and, more particularly, an<br>
air conditioner in which a hot-water is supplied through an<br>
operation of a heat pump capable of controlling a cooling<br>
ability and performance in accordance with a load in an<br>
indoor side (i.e. room or room side) while ensuring a<br>
suitable hot-water supplying ability.<br>
A conventional heat pump type hot-water supply<br>
device has the structure as shown in Fig. 8. A heat pump<br>
type hot-water supply device 21 has a refrigerating cycle<br>
22 and is formed by sequentially connecting a compressor<br>
23, a four-way valve 24, a heat exchanger 26 for heating<br>
water in a hot-water storing tank 25, a throttle 27, and an<br>
outdoor-side heat exchanger 28. In such a heat pump type<br>
hot-water supply device 21, when a temperature of the water<br>
in the hot water storing tank 25 becomes lower than 30° C, a<br>
hot-water storing operation is performed by a heat pump.<br>
However, the conventional heat pump type hot-water supply<br>
device 21 supplies hot water by using the heat pump, and<br>
another refrigerating cycle for cooling the indoor-side<br>
(interior of the room) is independently required to be<br>
located. Consequently, the exhaust heat of the<br><br>
refrigerating cycle for cooling the room cannot be used.<br>
As a heat pump type hot-water supply device<br>
utilizing an exhaust heat of the refrigerating cycle,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. HEI 11-72268<br>
discloses a heat pump type hot-water supply device for<br>
heating water of a hot-water supply circuit by an<br>
outdoor-side heat exchanger of a refrigerating cycle and is<br>
provided with a structure for preventing the temperature of<br>
warm water in a defrosting operation of the refrigerating<br>
cycle from being decreased. Such conventional heat pump<br>
type hot-water supply device provide a problem such that,<br>
since the refrigerating cycle is carried out in a single<br>
operation mode, good amenity at the time of a room cooling<br>
and hot-water storing operation cannot be realized.<br>
It is therefore required to provide a heat pump<br>
type hot-water supply air conditioner which can utilize an<br>
exhaust heat of a refrigerating cycle for cooling the room<br>
and is operated pleasantly in a room cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been achieved in<br>
consideration of the above-described circumstances and its<br>
object is to provide a heat pump type hot-water supply air<br>
conditioner which can utilize an exhaust heat of a<br>
refrigerating cycle for cooling an indoor side (room) and<br><br>
c:an be operated pleasantly at the time of the indoor-side<br>
(room) cooling and hot-water storing operation.<br>
This and other objects can be achieved according to<br>
the present invention by providing a heat pump type<br>
hot-water supply air conditioner comprising:<br>
a compressor;<br>
a four-way valve operatively connected to the<br>
compressor;<br>
a heat exchanger for heating water connected to<br>
the four-way valve;<br>
a flow rate control valve for an outdoor-side heat<br>
exchanger connected to the water heating heat exchanger;<br>
an outdoor-side heat exchanger connected at one end<br>
thereof to the flow rate control valve for an outdoor-side<br>
heat exchanger; and;<br>
a control unit operatively connected to the<br>
respective elements mentioned above,<br>
wherein the outdoor-side heat exchanger is<br>
connected at another one end thereof to the four-way valve<br>
so as to constitute a refrigerating cycle through a<br>
refrigerant pipe line and an indoor-side heat exchanger and<br>
an indoor-side heat exchanger are further arranged in<br>
parallel to the flow rate control valve for the<br>
outdoor-side heat exchanger and the outdoor-side heat<br>
exchanger, respectively.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the refrigerating cycle<br><br>
in operated in three operation modes including a normal<br>
cooling operation mode, a cooling and hot-water storing<br>
operation mode, and a hot-water storing operation mode<br>
which are switched by the control unit, and one of the<br>
three operation modes is selected in accordance with<br>
presence or absence of a cooling command and a temperature<br>
of the water to be supplied.<br>
A rotational speed of the compressor is changed<br>
according to a frequency of a power supplied from an<br>
inverter connected to the compressor, and when a cooling<br>
load is small, a frequency of the compressor is fixed to a<br>
predetermined frequency, and when the cooling load is<br>
large, the compressor is variable according to the cooling<br>
request load of an indoor side.<br>
In the cooling and hot-water storing operation<br>
mode, the flow rate control valve for the indoor-side heat<br>
exchanger is controlled so that a super-heat condition of<br>
the indoor-side heat exchanger becomes constant, and an<br>
opening degree of the flow rate control valve for the<br>
indoor-side heat exchanger is controlled according to the<br>
cooling load of the indoor side.<br>
The hot water is stored in a hot-water tank in<br>
which the water heating heat exchanger is disposed and a<br>
temperature sensor for detecting a temperature of the hot<br>
water in the hot-water tank is provided for the hot-water<br>
tank.<br><br>
According to the present invention of the<br>
characters and structures mentioned above, there is<br>
provided the heat pump type hot-water supply air<br>
conditioner capable of utilizing the exhaust heat of the<br>
refrigerating cycle for cooling the interior of the room<br>
and being operated pleasantly in the cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation mode.<br>
Specifically, the exhaust heat in the cooling<br>
operation mode is utilized to achieve energy saving and,<br>
furthermore, the cooling ability can be changed according<br>
to the load on the indoor-side (room side) while ensuring<br>
the suitable hot-water storing performance. Thus, omcnty<br>
for people can be also maintained excellent.0<br>
Furthermore, the hot-water storage and cooling<br>
function can be effectively attained. The real operating<br>
frequency of the compressor is forcibly increased to a<br>
predetermined value of the frequency, the heat is<br>
sufficiently released from the heat exchanger, and the<br>
desired hot-water storing ability is realized. Further,<br>
even in the case where the cooling load becomes large, the<br>
cooling capability in the indoor side will be increased,<br>
and hence, the operability conforming with the load can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Still furthermore, the balanced operation of the<br>
entire refrigerating cycle can be achieved, the heat pump<br>
type hot-water supply air conditioner can be operated in a<br><br>
stable state, the hot water can be surely stored and the<br>
amenity of a person in the indoor (room) side can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The nature and further characteristic features of<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of a heat pump type hot-water supply<br>
air conditioner according to the present invention will be<br>
described hereunder with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Further, it is to be noted that the term "heat pump<br>
type hot-water supply air conditioner" mentioned herein is<br>
an air conditioner of the type in which a hot-water is<br>
supplied through an operation of a heat pump.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a heat pump type hot-water supply air<br>
conditioner 1 provided with a refrigerating cycle 2. The<br>
refrigerating cycle 2 is constructed in a manner that a<br><br>
compressor 4 driven at any rotational speed by an inverter<br>
3, a four-way valve 5 connected on a discharge side 4a of<br>
the compressor 4, a heat exchanger 6 for heating water, a<br>
two-way valve 7, a flow rate control valve 8 for an<br>
outdoor-side heat exchanger (hereinbelow, called an<br>
outdoor-side flow rate control valve), and an outdoor-side<br>
heat exchanger 9, which is connected to the the four-way<br>
valve 5. These elements or members are sequentially<br>
connected, in a mentioned order, through a refrigerant pipe<br>
line or arrangement to a suction side 4b of the compression<br>
4 so as to realize a refrigerating cycle. A flow rate<br>
control valve 10 for an indoor-side (room side) heat<br>
exchanger (hereinbelow, called an indoor-side flow rate<br>
control valve) and an outdoor-side heat exchanger 11 are<br>
further provided in parallel to the outdoor-side flow rate<br>
control valve 8 and the outdoor-side heat exchanger 9,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the refrigerating cycle 2, by switching the<br>
four-way valve 5, a hot-water storing operation is<br>
performed by circulating a refrigerant in the direction<br>
shown by a solid-line arrow and a normal cooling operation<br>
is performed by circulating the refrigerant in the<br>
direction shown by a broken-line arrow.<br>
The compressor 4 is connected to the inverter 3<br>
controlled by a controller 12 for controlling the entire<br>
arrangement (all the elements or members) of the heat pump<br><br>
type hot-water supply air conditioner 1 to thereby control<br>
the rotational speed of the compressor 4 is controlled. The<br>
controller 12 is constructed by a CPU, an input/output<br>
interface, a ROM, a RAM, a timer, a counter or like and<br>
drives not only the compressor 4 but also the four-way<br>
valve 5, an outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8, an<br>
indoor-side flow rate control valve 10, an outdoor-side<br>
powered fan 9a, an indoor-side powered fan lla and the like<br>
on the basis of input signals from various sensors,<br>
change-over switches and the like.<br>
The heat exchanger 6 for heating water is disposed<br>
in a hot-water storing tank 14 incorporated in a hot-water<br>
supply apparatus 13 to heat water supplied to the hot-water<br>
heating tank 14 having a water temperature sensor 14s by<br>
the calorie of the refrigerant. Further, the heat exchanger<br>
6 can heat the water to a desired water temperature (hot<br>
water temperature) by using the water temperature sensor<br>
14s provided for the hot-water storing tank 14.<br>
Furthermore, each of the outdoor-side flow rate<br>
control valve 8 and the indoor-side flow rate control valve<br>
10 is, for example, a powered control valve of which<br>
opening degree is controlled by a pulse generated from the<br>
controller 12 and controls the flow rate of the refrigerant<br>
flowing through the outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8<br>
and the; indoor-side flow rate control valve 10.<br>
The outdoor-side heat exchanger 9 is provided with<br><br>
the outdoor-side powered fan 9a and an outdoor-side heat<br>
exchanger sensor 9s, is mounted on the outdoor-side of the<br>
room, is operated as an evaporator in the hot-water storing<br>
operation mode and operated as a capacitor in the normal<br>
cooling operation mode through the operation of the<br>
four-way valve 5 or the like. The indoor-side heat<br>
exchanger 11 is provided with the indoor-side powered fan<br>
lla and an indoor-side heat exchanger sensor 11s, is<br>
mounted on the indoor-side (room-side) and is operated as<br>
an evaporator.<br>
A suction sensor 15s is provided for a refrigerant<br>
pipe 15 for communicating the suction side 4b of the<br>
compressor 4, the outdoor-side heat exchanger 9 and the<br>
indoor-side heat exchanger 11.<br>
The heat pump type hot-water supply air conditioner<br>
1 is operated, as shown in Fig. 2, in three modes of a<br>
normal cooling operation mode, a cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation mode and a hot-water storing operation<br>
mode to be selected in accordance with the presence or<br>
absence of a cooling operation command and the quantity of<br>
remaining hot water (hot water temperature) in the<br>
hot-water storing tank 14.<br>
The operation modes of the heat pump type hot-water<br>
supply air conditioner 1 will be described hereunder.<br>
For example, in the normal cooling operation mode,<br>
as shown in Fig. 3, the refrigerant in the refrigerating<br><br>
cycle 2 is operated by repeating a refrigerating cycle of<br>
returning to the suction side 4b of the compressor 4<br>
through the discharge side 4a of the compressor 4, four-way<br>
valve 5, the outdoor-side heat exchanger 9, the<br>
outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8, the indoor-side<br>
flow rate control valve 10, the indoor-side heat exchanger<br>
11 and four-way valve 5. In the cooling operation, the<br>
refrigerant flowing in the refrigerating cycle 2 is<br>
compressed by the compressor 4, condensed and liquified by<br>
the outdoor-side heat exchanger 9, decompressed by the<br>
indoor-side flow rate control valve 10 and then evaporated<br>
by the indoor-side heat exchanger 11 to thereby cool the<br>
interior of the room. In the normal cooling operation mode,<br>
the refrigerant does not pass the water heating heat<br>
exchanger 6 through the operation of the four-way valve 5,<br>
so that hot water (water) in the hot-water storing tank 14<br>
is not newly heated.<br>
In the cooling and hot-water storing operation<br>
mode, as shown in Fig, 4, the temperature of the water<br>
decreases (for example, 45° C or lower) due to the newly<br>
supplied water, so that the heating of the water is<br>
required. As shown by a solid-line arrow in Fig. 4, a<br>
portion of the refrigerant in the refrigerating cycle 2<br>
returns to the suction side 4b of the compressor 4 through<br>
the discharge side 4a of the compressor 4, the four-way<br>
valve 5, the water heating heat exchanger 6, the two-way<br><br>
12 is small, the frequency of the compressor 4 is forcibly<br>
increased to a frequency (50 Hz) at which a sufficient<br>
hot-water storing ability or performance is obtained and<br>
the compressor 4 is then operated. On the other hand, when<br>
the cooling load of the room side becomes large, the<br>
compressor 4 is operated in accordance with the magnitude<br>
of the load. The indoor-side flow rate control valve 10 is<br>
controlled by an output of the controller 12 to make<br>
constant a super-heat condition (the temperature difference<br>
between the indoor-side heat exchanger sensor 11s and the<br>
suction sensor 15s) of the indoor-side heat exchanger 11.<br>
The valve opening of the outside flow rate control valve 8<br>
Is changed according to the cooling load of the room side<br>
inputted to the operation of the controller 12.<br>
Further, in the hot-water storing operation mode,<br>
as shown in Fig. 2, although there is no cooling command, a<br>
new water supply is required. Moreover, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5, the refringent in the refrigerating cycle 2 flows<br>
as shown by the arrow in Fig. 5 and returns to the suction<br>
side 4b of the compressor 4 through the discharge side 4a<br>
of the compressor 4, the four-way valve 5, the water<br>
heating heat exchanger 6, the two-way valve 7, the<br>
outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8, the outdoor-side<br>
heat exchanger 9 and the four-way valve 5. In the hot-water<br>
istoring operation, the refringent flowing in the<br>
refrigerating cycle 2 is compressed by the compressor 4,<br><br>
and the hot water is heated by the heat generated through<br>
the condensation of the refrigerant in the water heating<br>
heat exchanger 6. That is, although the refrigerant passes<br>
the heat exchanger 6 through the switching operation of the<br>
four-way valve 5 so as to heat the water (to store hot<br>
water), the room side (indoor-side) is not cooled. The<br>
hot-water storing operation is performed while fixing a<br>
real operation frequency of the compressor 4 at 50 Hz.<br>
As described above, the heat pump hot-water<br>
supplying air conditioner 1 can operate in the three modes<br>
of the normal cooling operation, cooling and hot-water<br>
sitoring operation, and hot-water storing operation selected<br>
as shown in Fig. 2 in accordance with the presence/absence<br>
of the cooling operation command and the amount of<br>
remaining hot water (temperature of hot water) in the<br>
hot-water storing tank 14 by the controller 12.<br>
Further, the operation of the heat pump type<br>
hot-water supply air conditioner 1 according to the present<br>
invention will be described hereunder.<br>
The operation mode of the heat pump type hot-water<br>
supply air conditioner 1 is determined according to the<br>
procedure shown in Fig. 6.<br>
First, the controller 12 shown in Fig. 1 reads<br>
input signals from the indoor-side (room-side) heat<br>
exchanger sensor 11s and the water temperature sensor 14s<br>
at the step SI and, thereafter, determines whether the<br><br>
cooling command is made or not in the step S2. In the case<br>
of "YES" in the step S3, it is discriminated whether the<br>
temperature of the hot water in the hot-water storing tank<br>
14 detected by the heater temperature sensor 14s is higher<br>
than 45° C or not. In the case of "YES", the refrigerating<br>
cycle 2 operates in accordance with the normal cooling<br>
operation mode. On the other hand, in the case of "NO", the<br>
refrigerating cycle 2 operates in the cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation mode.<br>
In the case of "NO" in the step S2, in a manner<br>
similar to the step S3, it is discriminated, in the step<br>
SA, whether the temperature of the hot water in the<br>
hot-water storing tank 14 is higher than 45° C or not. In<br>
the case of "YES", the refrigerating cycle 2 does not<br>
operate and remains in an operation stopping state. On the<br>
contrary, in the case of "NO", the refrigerating cycle 2<br>
operates in the hot-water storing operation mode.<br>
When the normal cooling operation mode is selected<br>
in the step S3, as shown in Fig. 3 and described above, the<br>
refrigerant does not pass the water heating heat exchanger<br>
6. Consequently, the interior of the room is cooled down<br>
and the hot water (water) in the hot-water storing tank 14<br>
is not newly heated.<br>
When the cooling and hot-water storing operation<br>
mode is selected in the step S3, as shown in Fig. 4 and<br>
described above, in the cooling and hot-water storing<br><br>
operation (in which the small amount of the hot water<br>
remains), it is necessary to cool down the interior of the<br>
room and newly supply water. In the cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation (in which the small amount of the hot<br>
water remains), the refrigerant flowing in the<br>
refrigerating cycle 2 is condensed by the heat exchanger 6<br>
to heat the water in the hot-water storing tank 14 and is<br>
then evaporated by the outdoor-side heat exchanger 9 and<br>
the indoor-side heat exchanger 11 and the interior of the<br>
room is cooled down by the indoor-side heat exchanger 11.<br>
Further, in the cooling and hot-water storing<br>
operation (in which the small amount of the hot water<br>
remains), when the cooling load is small and the operating<br>
frequency becomes low (for example, 30 Hz), as shown in<br>
Fig. 7, the real operating frequency of the compressor 4 is<br>
forcibly increased to 50 Hz by the controller 12, heat is<br>
sufficiently released from the heat exchanger 6 and a high<br>
hot-water storing ability is achieved. When the cooling<br>
load is large and the operating frequency is higher than<br>
50 Hz, the real operating frequency of the compressor 4<br>
becomes the operating frequency in accordance with the<br>
cooling load.<br>
The degree of opening of the outdoor-side flow rate<br>
conbrol valve 8 is about 60% (300 pulses) of the full open<br>
state (500 pulses). The operational balance of the entire<br>
refrigerating cycle 2 is ensured through the control to<br><br>
make the super-heat condition (temperature difference<br>
between the indoor-side heat exchanger sensor 11s and the<br>
suction sensor 15s) constant by the indoor-side flow rate<br>
control valve 10. Thus, the heat pump type hot-water supply<br>
air conditioner 1 can be operated in a stable state. The<br>
hot-water storing ability in this operating state can be<br>
sufficiently ensured because the operating frequency is<br>
forcibly made high. As for the cooling ability or<br>
performance for cooling the room, since the opening degree<br>
of the outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8 is adjusted<br>
to control the flow rate of the refrigerant to the<br>
indoor-side, the cooling capability balanced with a load<br>
can be realized.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 7, when the cooling<br>
operation frequency becomes 50 Hz or higher due to a<br>
fluctuation in the load, the opening degree of the<br>
outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8 becomes 0 (full<br>
closed state). The hot-water storing capability at this<br>
time is further increased by the increasing in the<br>
operating frequency. The refrigerant does not flow to the<br>
outdoor-side flow rate control valve 8 as shown by the<br>
solid-line arrow in Fig. 4 and flows to the indoor-side<br>
heat exchanger 11 as shown by a dotted-line arrow, so that<br>
the cooling ability also increases. Thus, the cooling<br>
performance corresponding to the load can be realized.<br>
When the hot-water storing operation mode is<br><br>
selected in the step S4, as shown in Fig. 5 and described<br>
above, the compressor 4 operates at a fixed frequency (50<br>
Hz), and the refrigerant flowing in the refrigerating cycle<br>
2 is compressed by the compressor 4 and subjected to the<br>
heat exchanging operation with the water through the heat<br>
exchanger 6 to heat the water. The refrigerant does not<br>
pass the indoor-side heat exchanger 11 and the interior of<br>
the room is not therefore cooled. Since the real operating<br>
frequency of the compressor 4 is fixed at 50 Hz by the<br>
controller 12 in the hot-water storing operation, the<br>
sufficient amount of the heat is released from the water<br>
heating heat exchanger 6, and the hot-water storing<br>
capability is achieved.<br>
Since the exhaust heat in the refrigerating cycle<br>
operation is used to store the hot-water (to heat the<br>
water) in the operation of the heat pump type hot-water<br>
supply air conditioner 1 as described above, the energy<br>
saving can be achieved. Further, the cooling ability and<br>
performance can be changed according to a load on the<br>
indoor-side in the state of the hot-water storing ability<br>
being maintained, so that an excellent amenity can be<br>
realized. Since the heat pump type hot-water supply air<br>
conditioner 1 is operated in the three operating modes of<br>
the normal cooling operation, the cooling and hot-water<br>
storing operation, and the hot-water storing operation.<br>
Therefore, the appropriate mode is selected according to<br><br>
the presence or absence of a cooling command and the<br>
operation under the water-temperature in the hot-water<br>
storing tank, so that the hot-water storage and cooling can<br>
be efficiently performed.<br>
According to the present invention, as mentioned<br>
hereinabove, there can be provided the heat pump type<br>
hoi:-water supply air conditioner which can utilize the<br>
exhaust heat of the refrigerating cycle for cooling the<br>
interior of the room and can be operated pleasantly in the<br>
cooling and hot-water storing operation mode.<br><br>
