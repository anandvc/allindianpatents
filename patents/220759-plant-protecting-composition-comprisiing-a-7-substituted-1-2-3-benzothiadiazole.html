				<td>The present invention relates to a plant-protecting composition comprising a 7-substituted 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole.<br>
The present invention relates to novel plant-protecting active ingredient mixtures having synergistically enhanced action, comprising at least two active ingredient components together with a suitable carrier, wherein component I is a compound having plant-immunising action of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
Z is CN, COOH or a salt thereof, CO-OC1-C4alkyl or CO-SC1-C4alkyl;<br>
and wherein component II is a commercial product selected from the group A)4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl]morpholine ("dimethomorph"), (Reference: C. Tomlin (Editor): The Pesticide Manual, 10th edition, Farnham, UK, 1994, pages 351-352);<br>
B)	5-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3]benzothiazole ("tricyclazole"), (Reference: C. Tomlin<br>
(Editor): The Pesticide Manual, 10th edition, Farnham, UK, 1994, pages 1017-1018); and<br>
C)	3-allyloxy-1,2-benzothiazole-1,1 -dioxide ("probenazole"), (Reference: C. Tomlin (Editor):<br>
The Pesticide Manual, 10th edition, Farnham, UK, 1994, pages 831-832).<br>
The invention relates also to salts and metal complexes of compounds I and II.<br>
Of the compounds of formula I, preference is given to those wherein<br>
Z is COOH (compound IA) or a salt thereof, CN (compound IB), COOCH3 (compound 1C) or<br>
COSCH3 (compound ID).<br><br>
Preferred salts are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, especially lithium, sodium,<br>
potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, and also organic salts, especially salts of saltforming<br>
amines, for example trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine,<br>
triethanolamine, morpholine.<br>
Very special preference is given to the compound of formula I wherein<br>
Z is COSCH3 (compound ID).<br>
It is known that compounds of formula I activate the plant's own latent defence system<br>
against pathogenic microbial influences and accordingly are able to protect the plant against<br>
pathogens (EP-A-313 512).<br>
At low rates of application those compounds have no direct action on the noxious organisms,<br>
but they immunise the healthy plant against diseases.<br>
The disadvantage in using compounds of formula I to control plant diseases is that the action<br>
is often inadequate at low rates of application.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that compounds of formula I in admixture with one of the<br>
conventional microbicides IIA to IIC have synergistically enhanced action. Using such<br>
mixtures it is possible to control plant diseases on the one hand by strengthening the plant<br>
by activating its own defence system and on the other hand by additionally controlling the<br>
pathogens directly. Compared with the customary methods of controlling plant diseases,<br>
unexpectedly small amounts of active ingredients are required.<br>
A particular advantage of the mixtures according to the invention is further that, because the<br>
modes of action of components I and II are completely different, the threat of resistance<br>
being developed in the control of plant diseases is effectively prevented.<br>
The synergistically enhanced action of mixtures of components I and II manifests itself, for<br>
example, in lower rates of application, a longer duration of action and altogether higher crop<br>
yields. Such enhancements were not to be expected from the sum of the actions of the individual<br>
components.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of protecting plants against plant diseases,<br>
especially against fungus infestation, by treating the plants, parts of the plants or their<br>
surroundings with a component I and a component II in any desired sequence or<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Advantageous mixing ratios of the two active ingredients are<br>
l:IIA = from 1:30 to 1:1, preferably l:ll =from 1:30 to 1:3 and from 1:10 to 1:3.<br>
l:IIB = from 1:20 to 1:1, preferably l:ll = from 1:5 to 1:1 and from 1:2.5 to 1:1.<br>
l:IIC = from 1:50 to 2:1, preferably l:ll = from 1:25 to 1:1 and from 1:10 to 1:2.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures l+ll according to the invention have very advantageous<br>
properties for protecting plants against disease infestation.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures of the invention can be used to inhibit or destroy the<br>
microorganisms which occur on plants or on parts of plants (the fruit, blossom, leaves,<br>
stems, tubers or roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time parts of<br>
plants that grow later are also protected against such microorganisms. They can also be<br>
used as dressings in the treatment of plant propagation material, especially seed (fruit,<br>
tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (e.g. rice), to provide protection against fungus infections<br>
as well as against phytopathogenic fungi which occur in the soil.The active ingredient<br>
mixtures according to the invention are distinguished by the fact that they are especially well<br>
tolerated by plants and are environmentally friendly.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures are effective against phytopathogenic fungi belonging to the<br>
following classes: Ascomycetes (e.g. Venturia, Podosphaera, Erysiphe, Monilinia, Mycosphaerella,<br>
Uncinula); Basidiomycetes (e.g. the genus Hemileia, Rhizoctonia, Puccinia);<br>
Fungi imperfect! (e.g. Botrytis, Helminthosporium, Rhynchosporium, Fusarium, Septoria,<br>
Cercospora, Alternaria, Pyricularia and, especially, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides);<br>
Oomycetes (e.g. Phytophthora, Peronospora, Bremia, Pythium, Plasmopara).<br>
Target crops for the areas of indication disclosed herein comprise within the scope of the<br>
present invention e.g. the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice,<br>
sorghum and related crops); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft<br>
fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries);<br>
leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard,<br>
poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber<br>
plants (marrows, cucumber, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit<br>
(oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus,<br>
cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocados, cinnamon,<br>
camphor); or plants such as maize, tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, vines, hops,<br>
bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals (flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved<br>
trees and evergreens, such as conifers). This list does not represent any limitation.<br>
The active ingredient mixtures according to the invention are especially advantageous for<br>
use in vegetables, rice and tobacco; also in potatoes, vines, lawn areas and hops.<br>
The mixtures are especially suitable as follows:<br>
a) I+IIA for the treatment of vegetables and tobacco against Oomycetes, especially against<br>
Phytophthora, Peronospora, Bremia;<br>
b) I+IIB for the treatment of rice against Fungi imperfecti, especially Pyricularia;<br>
c) I+IIC for the treatment of rice against Fungi imperfecti, especially Pyricularia, and against<br>
bacterial diseases.<br>
The mixtures of active ingredients of formulae I and II are generally used in the form of<br>
compositions. The active ingredients of formulae I and II can be applied to the area or plant<br>
to be treated either simultaneously or in succession on the same day, if desired together with<br>
further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed<br>
in formulation technology.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are the substances ordinarily<br>
employed in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances,<br>
solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilisers.<br>
A preferred method of applying an active ingredient mixture comprising at least one of each<br>
of the active ingredients I and II is application to the parts of the plants that are above the<br>
soil, especially to the leaves (foliar application). The frequency and rate of application<br>
depend upon the biological and climatic living conditions of the pathogen. The active ingredients<br>
can, however, also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil or via the water<br>
(systemic action) if the locus of the plant is impregnated with a liquid formulation (e.g. hi rice<br>
culture) or if the substances are introduced in solid form into the soli, e.g. in the form of<br>
granules (soil application). In order to treat seed, the compounds of formulae I and II can<br>
also be applied to the seeds (coating), either by impregnating the tubers or grains with a<br>
liquid formulation of each of the active ingredients in succession, or by coating mem with an<br>
already combined wet or dry formulation. In addition, in special cases, other methods of<br>
application to plants are possible, for example treatment directed at the buds or the fruit<br>
trusses.<br>
The compounds of the combination are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together<br>
with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are therefore<br>
formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsiftablo concentrates, coatable pastes, directly<br>
sprayable or dilutabte solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders,<br>
dusts, granules, or by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the<br>
compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering,<br>
coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the Intended objectives and the prevailing<br>
circumstances. Advantageous rates of application of the active ingredient mixture are<br>
normally from 50 g to 2 kg a.iVha, preferably from 100 g to 1000 g a.I./ha, especially from<br>
250 g to 700 g a.i./ha. In the case of the treatment of seed, the rates of appNcation are from<br>
0.5 g to 1000 g, preferably from 5 g to 100 g, a.l. per 100 kg of seed.<br>
The formulations are prepared In known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or<br>
grinding the active ingredients with extenders, eg. solvents, solid carriers and, where<br>
appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Suitable solvents are: aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions containing 8 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, e.g. xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes, phthalates, such as diburyi<br>
phthaiate or dioctyl phthaiate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cydohexane or paraffins,<br>
alcohols and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as ethanol, ethyiene glycol, ethylene<br>
gtycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar<br>
solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl su If oxide or dimethylformamide, as well<br>
as vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils, such as epoxWtsed coconut oil or soybean<br>
oil: or water.<br>
The solid carriers used, e.g. for dusts and dispersible powders, are normally natural mineral<br>
fillers, such as calcite, talcum, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the<br>
physical properties it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acid or highly dispersed<br>
absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers are porous types, for example<br>
pumice, broken brick, sepiolite or bentonite, and suitable nonsorbent carriers are, for<br>
example, calcite or sand. In addition, a great number of pregranulated materials of inorganic<br>
or organic nature can be used, e.g. especially dolomite or pulverised plant residues.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the active ingredients of formulae I and II to be formulated,<br>
suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants having<br>
good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The term "surfactants" will also be<br>
understood as comprising mixtures of surfactants.<br>
Particularly advantageous application-promoting adjuvants are also natural or synthetic<br>
phospholipids of the cephalin and lecithin series, e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine,<br>
phosphatidylglycerol and lysolecithin.<br>
The agrochemical compositions generally comprise 0.1 to 99 %, preferably 0.1 to 95 %, of<br>
active ingredients of formulae I and II, 99.9 to 1 %, preferably 99.9 to 5 %, of a solid or<br>
liquid adjuvant and 0 to 25 %, preferably 0.1 to 25 %, of a surfactant.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user<br>
will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention; in those Examples "active<br>
ingredient" denotes a mixture of compound I and compound II in a specific mixing ratio.<br>

Cufita a) b) c)<br>
The present invention relates to a plant-protecting composition having synergistic action against disease infestation, comprising at least two active ingredient components together with a suitable carrier, wherein component I is a 7-substituted 1, 2, 3-benzothiadiazole having plant-immunising action of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
Z is COOH or a salt thereof,  CO-OC1-C4alkyl or CO-SC1-C4alkyl;<br>
and wherein component II is a compound selected from the group IIA) 4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3 ,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl] morpholine ("dimethomorph"); and 11B) 5-methyl-l,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b] [1 ,3]benzothiazole ("tricyclazole");<br>
and wherein the ratio by weight of I :IIA is from 1:30 to 1:1 and the ratio by weight of I : IIB is from 1:20 to 1:1.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention; in those Examples "active ingredient" denotes a mixture of compound I and compound II in a specific mixing <br>
The finely ground active ingredient is uniformly applied, in a mixer, to the kaolin moistened<br>
with polyethylene glycol. Non-dusty coated granules are obtained in this manner.<br>
Suspension concentrate<br>
active ingredient (l:ll = 1:8) 40 %<br>
propylene glycol 10 %<br>

sodium lignosulfonate 10 %<br>
carboxymethylcellulose 1 %<br>
silicone oil (in the form of a 75 % emulsion in water) 1 %<br>
water 32 %<br><br>
The finely ground active ingredient is intimately mixed with the adjuvants, giving a suspension<br>
concentrate from which suspensions of any desired dilution can be obtained by dilution<br>
with water. Using such dilutions, living plants as well as plant propagation material can be<br>
treated and protected against infestation by microorganisms, by spraying, pouring or<br>
immersion.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
A synergistic effect exists whenever the action of an active ingredient combination is greater<br>
than the sum of the actions of the individual components.<br>
The action to be expected E for a given active ingredient combination obeys the so-called<br>
COLBY formula and can be calculated as follows (COLBY, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and<br>
antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations". Weeds, Vol.15, pages 20-22; 1967):<br>
ppm = milligrams of active ingredient (= a.i.) per litre of spray mixture<br>
X = % action by active ingredient I using p ppm of active ingredient<br>
Y = % action by active ingredient II using q ppm of active ingredient.<br>
According to Colby, the expected (additive) action of active ingredients l+ll using p+q ppm of<br>
X-Y<br>
active ingredient is E = X + Y -<br>
100<br>
If the action actually observed (O) is greater than the expected action (E), then the action of<br>
the combination is superadditive, i.e. there is a synergistic effect.<br>
O/E = synergy factor (SF)<br>
In the Examples which follow, the infestation of the untreated plants is assumed to be<br>
100 %, which corresponds to an action of 0 %.<br>
Example B-1: Action against Phvtophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
a) Curative action<br>
After a cultivation period of 3 weeks, tomato plants of the "Red Gnome" variety are sprayed<br>
with a zoospore suspension of the fungus and incubated in a cabinet at 18 to 20° and 100 %<br>
humidity. Humidification is stopped after 24 hours. When the plants have dried, they are<br>
sprayed with a mixture comprising the test compound formulated as a wettable powder in a<br>
concentration of 200 ppm. After the spray coating has dried, the plants are again placed in<br>
the humidity cabinet for 4 days. The activity of the test compounds is evaluated on the basis<br>
of the number and size of the typical leaf specks that have occurred after that time.<br>
b) Preventive-systemic action<br>
The test compound formulated as a wettable powder is applied in a concentration of 60 ppm<br>
(based on the volume of the soil) to the soil surface of three-week-old tomato plants of the<br>
"Red Gnome" variety planted in pots. After a 3-day waiting period, the undersides of the<br>
leaves of the plants are sprayed with a zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans. The<br>
plants are then kept in a spray cabinet for 5 days at 18 to 20°C and 100 % humidity. After<br>
that time, typical leaf specks form, the number and size of which are used to evaluate the<br>
activity of the test compounds.<br>
In particular, mixtures of component IA or ID with IIA yield good results.<br>
Example B-2: Action against Peronospora tabacina on tobacco plants<br>
Tobacco plants (6 weeks old) are sprayed with a formulated solution of the test compound.<br>
Four days after treatment, the plants are inoculated with a sporangia suspension of the<br>
fungus, kept at high humidity for 4 to 5 days and then incubated further under a normal day/-<br>
night sequence.<br>
Evaluation of the symptoms in the tests is based on the leaf surface infested with fungus.<br>
The infestation of the untreated plants corresponds to 0 % action.<br>
Component I: compound ID (benzothiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid thiomethyl ester)<br>
Component II: compound HA (dimethomorph)<br>
(Table Removed)  Example B-3: Action against Colletotrichum lagenarium on Cucumis sativus L.<br>
a) After a cultivation period of 10 to 14 days, cucumber plants are sprayed with a spray<br>
mixture prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. After 3 to<br>
4 days, the plants are infected with a spore suspension (1.0 x 105 spores/ml) of the fungus<br>
and incubated for 30 hours at high humidity and a temperature of 23°C. Incubation is then<br>
continued at normal humidity and 22°C to 23°C.<br>
Evaluation of protective action is made 7 to 10 days after infection and is based on fungus<br>
infestation.<br>
b) After a cultivation period of 10 to 14 days, cucumber plants are treated by soil application<br>
with a spray mixture prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound.<br>
After 3 to 4 days, the plants are infected with a spore suspension (1.5 x 105 spores/ml) of the<br>
fungus and incubated for 30 hours at high humidity and a temperature of 23°C. Incubation is<br>
then continued at normal humidity and 22°C.<br>
Evaluation of protective action is made 7 to 10 days after infection and is based on fungus<br>
infestation.<br>
In particular, mixtures of component IA or ID with IIA yield good results.<br>
Example B-4: Action against Pvricularia orvzae on rice plants<br>
Rice plants about 2 weeks old are placed together with the soil around the roots in a<br>
container filled with spray mixture. Fungus infestation is evaluated 36 days later. Infestation<br>
of the untreated plants corresponds to 0 % action.<br>
