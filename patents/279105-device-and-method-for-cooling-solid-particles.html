				<td>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR COOLING SOLID PARTICLES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for providing air at semi cryogenic<br>
temperatures during preparation of various products. In<br>
particularly, this invention relates to a method and<br>
apparatus for distributing air at semi cryogenic<br>
temperatures in cooling chambers during the process of<br>
preparing fine powders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the well known environmental challenges<br>
nowadays is the handling of used tires. Tnere are<br>
estimations that at least one billion tires are discarded<br>
around the world every year. These scrap tires are an<br>
ecological predicament in all countries in which<br>
automobiles and trucks are a standard mode of<br>
transportation. Over the years, many more, tires cast off<br>
in monumental piles than recycled or burned. It is<br>
estimated that in the US alone there are in excess of 1<br>
billion tires in illegal tire piles, generating dangerous<br>
conditions of uncontrollable fires, air pollution as well<br>
as health hazards.<br>
To date, most discarded tires were destined to be<br>
burned, assisting in alleviating an unending energy<br>
crisis. However, since the recognition by meteorologists<br>
of pending earth warming trends, burning tires is quickly<br>
becoming unacceptable solution and in some countries even<br>
illegal. Also, to date, many of the waste tires are<br>
simply shredded and buried in landfills. This too has<br>
become an undesirable solution as more and more countries<br>
recognize the danger in underground buried tires or tire<br>
parts, due to the adverse effect on the diminishing<br>
underground supplies of fresh water. Finally, tire piles<br>
serve as breeding grounds to colonies of disease infected<br>
rodents and incubation hot beds for dangerous and deadly<br>
insects. It is therefore clear that recycling must be the<br>
only acceptable and sustainable solution to the<br>
increasing problem of scrap tires.<br>
Recognizing all of the above, several attempts have<br>
been made to reduce the increasing number of scrap tires<br>
discarded annually by recycling them. Tire recycling has<br>
traditionally been accomplished using three distinctly<br>
different technologies:<br>
• All mechanical ambient grinding the rubber;<br>
• Cryogenically, freezing and crushing the rubber; and<br>
Pyrolysis or microwave treatment to melt rubber.<br>
There are quite few aspects involved in the<br>
implementation of the second type of technology, namely,<br>
the cryogenically, freezing and crushing the rubber to<br>
produce granular rubber which may be used as a<br>
supplementary material in fuel or in road building, etc.<br>
One of the aspects involved in this technology is the<br>
step of exposing the crushed rubber to reduced<br>
temperatures e.g. to a point of embrittling the synthetic<br>
rubber.<br>
Many conventional cryogenic recycling processes<br>
require the use of liquid nitrogen or solid carbon<br>
dioxide to lower the temperature of the material to be<br>
recycled to a point where a proceeding step of the<br>
process can yield a granular material such as a powder.<br>
However, such cryogenic processes are usually expensive<br>
to implement and to operate.<br>
Many solutions were proposed in the past to improve<br>
this cooling step of the process. Few of these solutions<br>
are the following:<br>
US 4,273,294 discloses an improvement of<br>
conventional cryogenic grinding system incorporating an<br>
impact mill by providing means to allow at least 70V of<br>
the embrittled material entering the mill to bypass the<br>
mill's inlet and means to restrict the flow of the cold<br>
gas through the impact mill.<br>
US 5,408,846 describes a cooling device for lowering<br>
the temperature of rubber or polystyrene materials for<br>
recycling purposes. The cooling device has an input<br>
feeder which inputs the material to be treated into a<br>
cooling chamber. The cooling chamber is an elongated<br>
chamber. The cooling chamber receives cold air from an<br>
external air refrigeration unit and circulates that air<br>
within the chamber. The material input into the cooling<br>
chamber is circulated therein by a circulating shaft.<br>
After 15-20 minutes, the input material is discharged<br>
through an output on the opposite end of the cooling<br>
chamber.- The material discharged temperature is -8C°C or<br>
lower.<br>
US 5,568,731 discloses an ambient air freezing<br>
system for producing chilled air in the cryogenic range<br>
of -120°C to -180°C without the use of cryogenic<br>
chemicals or other refrigerants.<br>
US 6,360,547 describes a method for cryogenically<br>
freezing materials, such as rubber, food, plastics by<br>
compressing ambient air to a first level, cooling the air<br>
back to an ambient temperature, compressing the air<br>
again, and then cooling the air followed by expanding the<br>
compressed air thereby cooling it down to cryogenic<br>
temperatures that is fed to the material to be processed.<br>
US 6,397,623 describes a cooling device in which the<br>
compressor and the expander are coupled to one crank<br>
shaft or interlocked crank shafts so as to use the<br>
expansion energy from the compressed air in the expander<br>
as an energy for compressing the outside air in the<br>
compressor, thereby reducing the running cost.<br>
US 7,125,439 discloses a method for providing clean<br>
air to an environment, by cooling incoming air, which may<br>
be contaminated with chemical, nuclear or biological<br>
contamination and removing water from the cooled air. The<br>
cooled air is passed through a regenerative pressure<br>
swing absorption system which removes the contaminants.<br>
The resulting, cleaned, air is expanded by an expander<br>
and is provided to the environment.<br>

cooling particles in a batch operation to cryogenic<br>
temperatures; and<br>
FIG. 2 exemplifies a method of carrying out the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A better understanding of the present invention is<br>
obtained when the following non-limiting detailed<br>
examples are considered in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
As previously discussed, one of the objects of the<br>
present invention is to provide method and means to cool<br>
down solid particles such as recycled tires particles so<br>
that the end product of the whole recycling process, of<br>
which the cooling process described and claimed herein- is<br>
a part, are particles that are in a form of fine or even<br>
ultrafine powder, typically particles of lu or less, as<br>
the unique way of cooling provided by the present<br>
invention results in frozen and highly brittle particles<br>
which may easily be pulverized into a fine or even<br>
ultrafine particles. Although various processes were<br>
suggested in the past to produce fine powders, still,<br>
they are rather expensive to operate as they either make<br>
use of refrigerants or cryogenic chemicals, or<br>
characterized by being an inefficient ambient grinding<br>
processes. Due to high production cost and other<br>
inefficiencies, ultra fine products have not been<br>
produced in large quantities from recycled materials. The<br>
solution provided by the present invention aims to<br>
overcome these obstacles.<br>
Although the invention is described hereinafter in<br>
connection with a process of recycling synthetic rubber<br>
such as rubber that originates from used tires, still,<br>
this is done for the convenience of the reader and the<br>
scope of the invention should not be understood to be<br>
restricted to that specific process.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a<br>
cooling arrangement 100 to which a pre-defined quantity<br>
(e.g. by weight) of synthetic rubber particles derived<br>
from processing used tires is conveyed by using any<br>
applicable solids conveying means known in the art per se<br>
such as conveying belt (not shown in this Fig.) .<br>
Typically, the particles which are of an averaged<br>
diameter in the range of 1 to 5 mm are fed into the top<br>
section of chamber 110, and they free fall 120 to the<br>
bottom of chamber 110, where they are subjected to mixing<br>
operation of mixer/stirrer 140. During their fall, there<br>
is an initial cooling of the particles. The mixer/stirrer<br>
(e.g. a rotary device) operates to ensure that no big<br>
lumps of particles are formed and that all the particles<br>
will be subjected to the cooling air, in order to obtain<br>
a substantially homogenous temperature at the range of<br>
-80°C to -100°C of the synthetic rubber particles present<br>
in the chamber. Once the quantity of particles is<br>
introduced into the chamber, it is closed and preferably<br>
sealed, and a plurality of cooling air discharging<br>
devices 130 are operative to cool down the particles.<br>
Four such cooling air discharging devices are illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1, demonstrating the introduction of cooling air<br>
from each side of the chamber. The air reaching each of<br>
these cooling air discharging devices is preferably<br>
cleaned, dried and compressed prior to reaching the air<br>
discharging devices, although in the alternative all<br>
these operations can be carried out within the cooling<br>
air discharging devices themselves and hence this<br>
alternative ¦should also be considered to be encompassed<br>
by the present invention. In the present example, the<br>
cooling air is introduced to the chamber at -9Q°C and at<br>
a pressure of few atmospheres. When introduced into the<br>
chamber, the air expands, thereby causing its own<br>
temperature to further reduce. The discharge section of<br>
each of the cooling air discharging devices is preferably<br>
designed to blow air somewhat above the particles being<br>
mixed/stirred to avoid too much turbulences among the<br>
particles that might results in particles flowing all<br>
over the chamber, but near enough to the particles to get<br>
an efficient cooling thereof. Typically, the particles<br>
stay in the chamber for about 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
Thereafter, the particles are discharged at the chamber's<br>
bottom section airlock after they have become brittle and<br>
consequently easy to pulverize, to another solid<br>
conveying means for further processing the frozen<br>
granules, e.g. they can then be further ground or crushed<br>
to produce the desired ultra fine powder.<br>
Although the present invention was described in the<br>
above example in connection with synthetic rubber<br>
particles obtained from used tires, as will be understood<br>
by those skilled in the art it can be used for<br>
cryogenically cooling materials such as polymers, rubber<br>
based materials and the like without using refrigerants<br>
or cryogenic chemicals in the process.<br>
In order to obtain the cooling air required for the<br>
process any method known in the art per se, that is<br>
applicable to produce the air at the right physical<br>
conditions of temperature and pressure and the right<br>
cleanness and dryness levels can be used. For example, by<br>
taking ambient air, compressing and expanding it by using<br>
multiple' turbo expander machines. The oil resulting from<br>
the compression is removed and the air is cleaned and<br>
dried before compression. The cooled air may then be fed<br>
into the cooling chamber, after reaching a temperature of<br>
-80 to -100 degree C.<br>
A suitable filter for the air preparation process<br>
could be an inertial separator. This may be achieved by<br>
passing the air through a filter, such as a Borosilicate<br>
micro-fiber filter, in which water, oil and particles are<br>
removed using a coalescing effect. Alternatively a silica<br>
gel or an activated alumina could be usea as an<br>
adsorbent, so as to dry the air by chemically reacting to<br>
the water vapor in the air within the filter to adsorb<br>
and remove the water vapor.<br>
Another option is using a thermodynamic cycle,<br>
otherwise known as the "Russian cycle", where the<br>
compressor and turbo expander are located in one cylinder<br>
and chamber connected horizontally with the motor so as<br>
to use the expansion energy from the compressed air in<br>
the expander as an energy for compressing the outside air<br>
in the compressor, thereby reducing the running cost. The<br>
unit is environmentally friendly low-temperature cycle<br>
(up to -110°C) enclosed in one functional block<br>
aggregate, and can be fully automated.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art,<br>
although the particles themselves undergo a batch type of<br>
operation as they are maintained within the chamber for a<br>
predefined period of time, still, the discharge of the<br>
cooling air may be a continuous type of operation, as<br>
long as the particles are introduced and removed from the<br>
cooling chamber through sealed means such as airlocks.<br>
Fig. 2 exemplifies a method for use in a process of<br>
cooling materials that eventually should be pulverized<br>
such as rubber based materials, polymers ana the like,<br>
carried out according to the present invention. At first,<br>
a plurality of particles is provided (step 200) having an<br>
average diameter of less than 6 mm, and are preferably<br>
between 1 to 5 mm. The particles are fed through a top<br>
section of a cooling chamber (step 210) where they are<br>
allowed to free fall to the bottom section of the<br>
chamber. There they are mechanically stirred (step 220)<br>
for a pre-defined period of time of about 10-15 minutes<br>
while cooling the particles down by air provided via a<br>
plurality of air cooling air discharging devices (step<br>
230). Upon expiring the pre-defined period of time, the<br>
frozen particles are removed (step 240) from the cooling<br>
chamber.<br>
While only the above embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been illustrated and described, it is to<br>
be understood that many changes and modifications may be<br>
made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
