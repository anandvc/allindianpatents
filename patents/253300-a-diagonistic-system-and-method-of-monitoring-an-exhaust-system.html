				<td>FIELD The present invention relates to methods and systems for<br>
diagnosing a fault of a catalyst and a post-catalyst oxygen sensor in a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND During the combustion process, gasoline is oxidized and<br>
hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) combine with air. Various chemical compounds are<br>
formed including carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), carbon monoxide (CO),<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur oxides (SOx), and<br>
other compounds.<br>
. Automobile exhaust systems include a catalytic converter that<br>
reduces exhaust emissions by chemically converting the exhaust gas into carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N), and water (H2O). Exhaust gas oxygen sensors<br>
generate signals indicating the oxygen content of the exhaust gas. An inlet or<br>
pre-catalyst oxygen sensor monitors the oxygen level associated with an inlet<br>
exhaust stream of the catalytic converter. This inlet O2 sensor is also the primary<br>
feedback mechanism that maintains the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio of the engine at the<br>
chemically correct or stoichiometric A/F ratio that is needed to support the<br>
catalytic conversion processes. An outlet or post-catalyst oxygen sensor<br>
monitors the oxygen level associated with an outlet exhaust stream of the<br><br>
catalytic converter. The post-02 sensor signal is used for secondary A/F ratio<br>
control.<br>
 System diagnostics monitor the function of the oxygen sensors<br>
and the catalytic converter to ensure proper operation. Traditionally, diagnostics<br>
employ separate intrusive tests that evaluate the operation of the sensors and<br>
the catalytic converter. During the intrusive tests, the A/F ratio is manipulated<br>
and the sensor response is monitored. However, multiple intrusive tests may<br>
increase exhaust emissions and/or cause engine instability and reduced<br>
driveability that may be noticeable by a vehicle operator. Further, traditional<br>
diagnostics are more complex and computationally intense than desired.<br>
SUMMARY Accordingly, a diagnostic system for an exhaust system<br>
including a catalyst and a post-catalyst oxygen sensor is provided. The system<br>
generally includes a fuel control module that commands fuel to transition from a<br>
rich condition to a lean condition and that commands fuel to transition from the<br>
lean condition to the rich condition. A first diagnostic module monitors the post-<br>
catalyst oxygen sensor during the transition from the rich condition to the lean<br>
condition. A second diagnostic module monitors the catalyst during the transition<br>
from the lean condition to the rich condition.<br>
 In other features, a method of monitoring an exhaust system<br>
that includes a catalyst and a post-catalyst oxygen sensor is provided. The<br>
method generally includes: commanding fuel to transition from a rich condition to<br><br>
a lean condition; monitoring the post-catalyst oxygen sensor during the transition<br>
from the rich condition to the lean condition; commanding fuel to transition from<br>
the lean condition to the rich condition; and monitoring the catalyst during the<br>
transition from the lean condition to the rich condition.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION the following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine<br>
system 12, a fuel system 13, an exhaust system 14, and a control module 16.<br>
The engine system 12 includes a throttle 17, a throttle position sensor (TPS) 18, a mass air flow (MAF) sensor 20, an intake manifold 22 and an engine 24. The<br>
exhaust system 14 includes an exhaust manifold 26, a catalyst 28, a pre-catalyst<br>
or inlet oxygen sensor 30, hereinafter referred to as pre-02 sensor 30, and a<br>
post-catalyst or outlet oxygen sensor 32, herein after referred to as post-02<br>
sensor 32.<br>
 Air is drawn into the engine 24 through the throttle 17 and the<br>
intake manifold 22, and is mixed with fuel from the fuel system 13 inside the<br>
engine 24. The throttle position sensor 18 communicates a throttle position<br>
signal to the control module 16. The MAF sensor 20 communicates a MAF<br>
signal to the control module 16. The air and fuel mixture is combusted within<br>
cylinders (not shown) to generate drive torque. The gases produced via<br><br>
combustion exit the engine 24 through the exhaust manifold 26. The exhaust<br>
gases are treated within the catalyst 28.<br>
 The pre-02 sensor 30 and the post-02 sensor 32 generate<br>
respective voltage signals that are communicated to the control module 16. The<br>
pre-02 and post-02 sensor signals indicate the oxygen content of the exhaust<br>
entering and exiting the catalyst 28, respectively. Based thereon, the control<br>
module 16 communicates with the fuel system 13 to regulate fuel flow to the<br>
engine 24. In this manner, the control module 16 regulates the air-to-fuel ratio of<br>
the engine 24 to be at or near a desired value (e.g., a stoichiometric value). The<br>
control module 16 diagnoses components of the exhaust system 14 based on<br>
one or both of the pre-02 and post-02 sensor signals. In particular, the control<br>
module 16 diagnoses the post-02 sensor 32 and the catalyst 28 based on the .<br>
post-02 sensor signal and/or the pre-02 sensor signal.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) is<br>
typically a narrow range "switching" sensor. The voltage output signal is<br>
generated by the sensor 32 (Figure 1) based on the oxygen content of the<br>
exhaust gases passing thereby. High amounts of oxygen content indicate that<br>
the air-to-fuel ratio is lean or less than the desired value. In contrast, low<br>
amounts of oxygen content indicate that the air-to-fuel ratio is rich or greater than<br>
the desired value. Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary oxygen sensor signal 40 that<br>
is generated by the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) while the control module 16<br>
(Figure 1) is diagnosing the components of the exhaust system 14 (Figure 1).<br><br>
 In general, an oxygen sensor signal generated by a healthy or<br>
operating sensor varies based on the oxygen content of the exhaust gas. A<br>
common characteristic of a malfunctioning oxygen sensor is a lazy or sluggish<br>
response. For example, with a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, an increased<br>
amount of time is required for the signal to transition from high to low (e.g., rich to<br>
lean) and/or low to high (e.g., lean to rich). Therefore, the control module 16<br>
(Figure 1) diagnoses the oxygen sensor during a first rich to lean transition as<br>
shown at 42, during a second lean to rich transition as shown at 44, or during<br>
both the first rich to lean transition 42 and the second lean to rich transition 44.<br>
 The oxygen sensor signal 40 can also be used to diagnose the<br>
catalyst 28. For example, the post-02 sensor signal 40 and/or the pre-02 sensor<br>
signal (not shown) can be monitored during the second lean to rich transition as<br>
shown at 46 to estimate an oxygen storage capacity of the catalyst 28. The<br>
control module 16 (Figure 1) performs the estimation after a fuel cutoff period as<br>
shown at 47, so that the catalyst 28 can be saturated with oxygen.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of the diagnostic system that may be embedded within the control<br>
module 16. Various embodiments of diagnostic systems according to the<br>
present disclosure may include any number of sub-modules embedded within the<br>
control module 16. As can be appreciated, the sub-modules shown may be<br>
combined and/or further partitioned to similarly diagnose components of the<br>
exhaust system 14 (Figure 1). Inputs to the system may be sensed from the<br>
vehicle 10 (Figure 1), received from other control modules (not shown) within the<br><br>
vehicle 10 (Figure 1), and/or determined by other sub-modules (not shown)<br>
within the control module 16. In various embodiments, the control module 16 of<br>
Figure 3 includes a fuel control module 50, an oxygen sensor diagnostic module<br>
52, and a catalyst diagnostic module 54.<br>
 The fuel control module 50 regulates the air-to-fuel ratio of the<br>
engine 24 (Figure 1) by generating a fuel control signal 56 to the fuel system 13<br>
(Figure 1). The fuel control module 50 controls the air-to-fuel ratio such that the<br>
diagnosing of both the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) and the catalyst 28 (Figure<br>
1) can be performed during a single intrusive operation. By combining the fuel<br>
control for diagnosing both the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) and the catalyst 28<br>
(Figure 1), the number of intrusive operations as well as the amount of time spent<br>
in the intrusive operation is reduced thus, improving emissions as well as fuel<br>
economy.<br>
 In various embodiments, the fuel control module 50 determines<br>
if a non-intrusive operation is desired or if an intrusive operation can be<br>
performed based on, for example, engine operating parameters 58. For<br>
example, a non-intrusive operation is desired when the driver performs a<br>
deceleration fuel cut-off maneuver, such as coasting down a hill. During the<br>
deceleration fuel cut-off (DFCO) mode, the fuel control module 50 commands the<br>
fuel control signal 56 such the oxygen sensor signal 40 (Figure 2) transitions<br>
from rich to lean. This allows the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) to be diagnosed.<br>
 The fuel control module 50 then, if desirable, commands the fuel<br>
control signal 56 such that the lean condition is maintained for a time period<br><br>
sufficient to allow the catalyst 28 (Figure 1) to become saturated with oxygen.<br>
Thereafter, the fuel control module 50 commands the fuel control signal 56 such<br>
that the air-to-fuel ratio and thus, the oxygen sensor signal 40 (Figure 1)<br>
transitions from lean to rich. This allows the catalyst 28 (Figure 1) and the post-<br>
02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) to be diagnosed. The fuel control module 50 generates<br>
a control status 60 indicating the state of operation of the fuel control. In various<br>
embodiments, the control status 60 is an enumeration with values indicating at<br>
least one of 'rich to lean transition' and 'lean to rich transition.'<br>
 The oxygen sensor diagnostic module 52 receives as input the<br>
post-02 sensor signal 40 and the control status 60. The oxygen sensor<br>
diagnostic module 52 monitors the performance of the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure<br>
1) by calculating an integrated area (IA) above or below the sensor's voltage<br>
signal during the transition from rich to lean and/or the transition from lean to rich.<br>
As the signal transition speed decreases, the IA increases. The IA is compared<br>
to a threshold IA (IATHR) to determine whether the signal has so deteriorated that<br>
the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) should be serviced or replaced. Based on the<br>
comparison, the oxygen sensor diagnostic module 52 sets a post-02 (P02) fault<br>
status 62. For example, if the IA is greater than the IATHR, the P02 fault status<br>
62 is set to TRUE' or Test Fail.' If the IA is less than or equal to the IATHR, the<br>
fault status is set to 'FALSE' or Test Pass.' In various embodiments, a separate<br>
P02 fault status 62 can be implemented for the rich to lean transition and the<br>
lean to rich transition.<br><br>
 With reference to Figures 2 and 3, the IA is calculated between<br>
first and second voltages V1 and V2, respectively. V1 and V2 are selected based<br>
on preliminary data analysis of the lean (e.g., during DFCO) and rich transitions<br>
for a plurality of combinations of the post-catalyst oxygen sensor and catalyst<br>
states. For example, the preliminary data includes data collected using a good<br>
(i.e., appropriately functioning) post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined with a<br>
good catalyst, a good post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined with a bad catalyst<br>
(i.e., not appropriately functioning), a bad post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined<br>
with a bad catalyst, and a bad post-catalyst oxygen sensor combined with a good<br>
catalyst. The voltages that are the most sensitive to failure of the post-catalyst<br>
oxygen sensor and at the same time is the least sensitive to the catalyst state are<br>
selected. The voltages are selected separately for the first rich to lean transition<br>
42 and for the second lean to rich transition 44. An exemplary method and<br>
system for computing an IA is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
11/671,916 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 Referring back to Figure 3, the catalyst diagnostic module 54<br>
receives as input the post-02 sensor signal 40, the pre-02 sensor signal 64, the<br>
MAF signal 66, and the control status 60. When the control status 60 indicates a<br>
lean to rich transition, the catalyst diagnostic module 54 computes an oxygen<br>
storage capacity (OSC) of the catalyst 28 (Figure 1) over a target time period.<br>
The OSC is computed based on the MAF signal 66 and the oxygen sensor<br>
signals 40 and 64. An exemplary method and system for computing an OSC of<br><br>
the catalyst is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,874,313 and incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
 The catalyst diagnostic module 54 compares the OSC to a<br>
threshold OSC (OSCTHR) to diagnose a conversion capability of the catalyst 28<br>
(Figure 1). Based on the conversion capability, the catalyst diagnostic module 54<br>
sets a catalyst fault status 68. For example, if the computed OSC is greater than<br>
the OSCTHR, the catalyst fault status 68 is set to 'FALSE' or Test Pass.' If the<br>
computed OSC is less than or equal to the OSCTHR, the catalyst fault status 68 is<br>
set to TRUE'or Test Fail.'<br>
 Referring now to Figure 4, a flowchart illustrates a diagnostic<br>
method that can be performed by the diagnostic system of Figure 3 in<br>
accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. As can be<br>
appreciated, the order of execution of the steps of the diagnostic method can<br>
vary without altering the spirit of the method. The method may be performed<br>
periodically during vehicle operation, scheduled to run based on certain events<br>
(e.g., once per key cycle), or based on an initiated command.<br>
 The method may begin at 100. At 110, it is determined whether<br>
the exhaust system diagnostic can be enabled. For example, if a non-intrusive<br>
fuel transition is to occur (e.g., DFCO), the diagnostic can be enabled. It is<br>
appreciated, however, that the diagnostic can be enabled any time deemed<br>
appropriate and can be enabled using an intrusive fuel transition. Once the<br>
diagnostic can be enabled at 110, fuel is commanded lean via the fuel control<br>
signal 56 at 120 and the IA is computed at 130 and evaluated at 140. If the IA is<br><br>
greater than a predetermined IA threshold at 140, the P02 fault status 62 is set<br>
to Test Pass' at 150. Otherwise, if the IA is less than or equal to the<br>
predetermined IA threshold at 140, the P02 fault status 62 is set to Test Fail' at<br>
160 and the method may end at 280.<br>
 Once the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) has passed the<br>
diagnosing at 150, a time period is evaluated at 170. If a predetermined time<br>
period for operating in the lean condition has elapsed at 170, fuel is commanded<br>
rich via the fuel control signal 56 at 180 and the OSC is computed at 190 and<br>
evaluated at 200. If the OSC is greater than a predetermined OSC threshold at<br>
200, the catalyst fault status 68 is set to Test Pass' at 210. Otherwise, if the<br>
OSC is less than or equal to the predetermined OSC threshold at 200, the<br>
catalyst fault status 68 is set to Test Fail' at 220.<br>
 Once the catalyst 28 (Figure 1) is diagnosed at 210 or 220, the<br>
post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) can optionally be evaluated during the lean to rich<br>
transition. The IA is computed 230 and evaluated at 240. If the IA is less than a<br>
predetermined IA threshold at 240, the P02 fault status 62 is set to Test Pass' at<br>
260. Otherwise, if the IA is greater than a predetermined IA threshold at 240, the<br>
P02 fault status 62 is set to Test Fail' at 270. Thereafter, the method may end<br>
at 280.<br>
 As can be appreciated, once the fault status 62 or 68 for either<br>
the catalyst 28 (Figure 1) or the post-02 sensor 32 (Figure 1) is set to Test Fail,'<br>
additional steps can be performed to notify other systems and users of the<br>
failure. In various embodiments, a diagnostic code is set based on the fault<br><br>
status 62 or 68. The diagnostic code can be retrieved by a service tool or<br>
transmitted to a remote location via a telematics system. In various other<br>
embodiments, an indicator lamp is illuminated based on the fault status 62 or 68.<br>
In various other embodiments, an audio warning signal is generated based on<br>
the fault status 62 or 68.<br>

implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>

capacity; and<br><br>
generating a pass status signal when the oxygen storage capacity is<br>
greater than the threshold oxygen storage capacity.<br>
11.The method as claimed in claim 10, comprising generating a fail status<br>
signal when the oxygen storage capacity is less than the threshold oxygen<br>
storage capacity.<br>
12.The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the first period starts when a<br>
first rich air/fuel (A/F) ratio is commanded and ends when transitions from<br>
the first rich A/F ratio to a lean A/F ratio and from the lean A/F ratio to a<br>
second rich A/F ratio are completed.<br>
13.The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the second period starts<br>
when the first rich A/F ratio is achieved and ends when the transitions are<br>
completed.<br>
14. The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the commanding of the first<br>
rich A/F ratio and the transitions are forced during an active diagnostic<br>
operation.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE: A DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM AND METHOD OF MONITORING<br>
OF MONITORING AN EXHAUST SYSTEM	<br><br>
The invention relates to a diagnostic system for an exhaust system having a<br>
catalyst and a post-catalyst oxygen sensor, comprising: a first diagnostic module<br>
that monitors the post-catalyst oxygen sensor during a first period, that<br>
estimates a total integrated area based on a signal from the post-catalyst oxygen<br>
sensor, that compares the total integrated area to a threshold integrated area,<br>
and that determines a pass/fail status of the post-catalyst oxygen sensor based<br>
on the comparison, wherein the first diagnostic module generates a pass status<br>
signal when the total integrated area is less than the threshold integrated area<br>
and generates a fail status signal when the total integrated area is greater than<br>
the threshold integrated area; and a second diagnostic module that monitors the<br>
catalyst during a second period, and that determines a pass/fail status of the<br>
catalyst based on the monitoring during the second period, wherein the first<br>
period includes the second period, and wherein the second period starts after the<br>
first period starts.</td>
