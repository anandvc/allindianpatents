Further, software packages that support language processing are tailor made to suit certain systems before delivery. This limits the number of users that can use the package. Again, the end user looses flexibility and ends up spending lot of money.<br>
In addition, there are hardly any printers in the world capable of printing characters in a myriad of Indian languages. The primary reason for the lack of such printers is the inherent complexity of Indian languages. Most Indian languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam involve the use of a number of stroke and stroke-type symbols on and below the alphabets to denote various sounds. These are often termed as "Matras, Vowels, Halants, consonants or Nukta characters". The strokes and stroke-type symbols are characterised by their size and direction. The total number of strokes and stroke-type symbols used would be about 10-15 in each Indian language. Existing language printer-systems have a keyboard attached to a computer. The keys on the keyboard represent different alphabets of the desired Indian language. The stroke and stroke-type symbols are also represented by some keys. The operator types the alphabets using the keys on the keyboard and manipulates the alphabets by inserting stroke or stroke-type symbols to form the desired characters, words etc. The major defect in these systems is that the operator must be literate in the desired language. Further, all these systems are driven by the software resident in the computers. The printer merely prints the data assembled by the computer in the form of bitmaps or graphic pixel images. There is no printer capable of performing all the above mentioned operations by itself.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to develop a printer that can print in different languages irrespective of the input, and wherein such a device is compatible with various computer systems.<br>
OBJECTS<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel language printer, which has resident fonts that enables it to assemble and print characters in different languages.<br><br>
Another object is to provide a language printer which has a microprocessor which enables the printer to handle huge amounts of data independent of the host computer system.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a novel language printer wherein the computer system is capable of transferring character data in codes rather than in graphics pixel mode so that the amount of data to be transferred by computers to the printer is reduced by more than 60%.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide language printers that are capable of handling data independent of computer system leaving the systems free for other multi-tasking operations.<br>
According to another object, the invention provides a printer which is enabled for bi-directional printing of language text;<br>
According to yet another object, is provided a printer capable of printing data in various modes such as draft, italics, condensed italics, attributes such as underlines, overstrike, double strike and combinations thereof.<br>
Another object is to provide a printer which uses bit map data called 'Compose* wherein composite characters are formed by a combination of stroke or stroke-type characters i.e. Vowels, Vowel Modifiers, Matras, Halant, invisible consonants and Nukta characters.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a printer which uses embedded logical codes (TLC) which make possible multilingual printing having a combination of at least four Brahmi languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Oriya, Assamese, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali etc. apart from English, as well as a mixture of languages to be printed in the same line or text.<br>
Another object is to provide printers that are capable of transliteration of text from one language to another.<br><br>

In accordance with the foregoing objects, the present invention provides a novel multilingual bi-directional printer. As shown in the drawings accompanying the specification, Fig 3 is the block diagram providing the basic working of the printer of the invention wherein the computer systems transfer character data in codes rather than graphics pixel mode. This reduces the amount of data to be transferred by computers by 40 to 60 times and consequently computers are relieved from data transfer faster which allows them to spend their time effectively on other tasks. Conversion of character code to character bit-map (pixel) information is done in the said novel printers. Also obviously the time taken to transfer character information is very less compared to the graphics information required. The innovation supports ISCII-91 (Indian Script Code for Information lnterchange-91) code for character codes, which is the standard<br><br>
code recommended by Department of Electronics (DOE) to be used for the language purposes. The innovation optionally supports PC-ISCII code also.<br>
As shown in fig 3 and 4 of the drawings accompanying the specification, the printer has an interface (Centronics parallel or RS-232C serial) hardware means for receiving data from computer system. The received data will be processed for various types such as printable character codes and non-printable codes such as codes for platen movement, character attributes etc. For printable characters, the corresponding font information is fetched from the embedded resident font information and given to Print Head(PH) to form the character by coherently moving the carriage by giving appropriate signals to carriage motor through carriage motor driving hardware interface. Non-printable codes are processed and action is taken accordingly by giving appropriate signals to platen motor interface hardware or indicating the selected language or attribute etc. The selection of language or attributes will be indicated by a specific value stored in specified memory locations which will be read by the other parts of the logic codes to take action accordingly. The commands given by the user through the Operational Panel also are processed and action is taken accordingly.<br>
The heart of the printer is a microprocessor (processor) with the logical codes (instructions) embedded into Erasable Programmable Read only Memory (EPROM) called TLC\ Based on the instructions fetched from TLC, the microprocessor does various functions such as fetching the data code from computer, processing the fetched data code, activating proper interfaces such as Carriage Motor Drive, Platen Motor Drive, Print Head Drive, Operational Panel etc. The processor also gets the commands given through operational panel and carries out appropriate actions such as moving platen motor, going to Off-Line etc.<br>
The present invention of Language printing carried out both by the hardware and logical codes (instructions) embedded in the TLC.<br>
The hardware of Language printer consists of Mitsubishi 16-bit micro-controller addressing memory capacity of 1024 Kbytes of TLC which is holding the logical codes, font information<br><br>
and 64Kbytes of ReadA/Vrite memory used for storing the codes sent by the computer, the bitmap information and values of variable used during the processing. The processor also addresses the computer interface and other drive hardware circuits. As shown in Fig. 4 the hardware modification includes addition of an AND gate to generate the extra addressing required for extra RAM capacity which is increased from 32 Kbytes to 64 Kbytes. Similarly the ROM capacity has been increased from 512 Kbytes to 1024 Kbytes to accommodate the font information and logic specific to language processing. The logic resides embedded in TLC forming part of the hardware and hence it does not fall in to the classification of software available on Floppy, Hard disk, Optical disk, Tape drive and such other media. It is equivalent to mask programming of microprocessors considered as hardware components. Hence any logic related references mentioned here in the invention should be considered as logic implemented through hardware.<br>
The working of the printer of the invention is illustrated in greater detail in the following paragraphs, giving various examples and, where-ever necessary, algorithms. These are provided merely to illustrate the invention. Various modifications that would be apparent to those skilled in the art are not defined in detail, but such modifications are deemed to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As mentioned above, The logical code (TLC) incorporates an efficient way of processing the logic required for language printing. It stores basic character font information called Indian Script Font Code (ISFOC) initially itself in vertical format, the way the print head is to be provided for further processing to form complete character font. This way of keeping font information makes the total conversion from ISCII code received from computer system to the final bitmap information very efficient and faster. As shown in Fig 3 the invention keeps the basic (ISFOC character) font information in the vertical form residing along with embedded logical codes (TLC). The language character information is received in ISCII-91 or PC-ISCII codes. These ISCII-91 or PC-ISCII codes from computer are converted into intermediate ISFOC character codes. The ISFOC font information corresponding to the ISFOC character codes generated as a result of converting the received ISCII codes are processed based on<br><br>
the language rules to form final character bitmap information that is given to Print Head to form characters on the paper. The logic used to arrive at the final character bit-map data called 'Compose' is very simple and efficient due to the method followed in the initial storage of basic ISFOC font information (vertical format). All the character vertical form bit-map (pixel) information is stored in 24bits( 3 bytes) X 'x1 matrix form, where 'x' value depends on character width in no. of pixels. The character pixel information will have header indicating width and left offset. The algorithm used for composing is indicated in the Annexure 2. This method of composing requires very minimal processor time. Simple logical OR operation will fetch the final character font (pixel or dot) information required to be sent to the Print Head. The Brahmi character formation is different from that of Roman ( English like ) languages in the sense that two or three receive codes from computer system, in this case ISCII codes, to be combined to form one single final character. The/ composite characters are formed through combination of Vowels, Matras, vowel modifiers, /Halant, Invisible consonants and Nukta characters whose definitions is given hereinbelow. Example 1: COMPOSE ALGORITHM Is ISFOC codes exhausted If yes<br>
Go to End Else<br>
Take Basic Character Pixel information and transfer to temporary memory based on width that gives an indication of the number of bytes to be catered. Is next ISFOC Code is part of the previous character If yes<br>
Based on the Offset, identify the position of the starting byte for composing and<br>
carryout logical-OR operation between the basic character pixel bits<br>

The said method of composing requires very minimal processor time. Simple logical OR operation will fetch the final character font (pixel or dot) information required to be sent to the Print Head. The Brahmi character formation is different from that of Roman (English like) languages in the sense that two or three receive codes from computer system, in this case ISCII codes, to be combined to form one single final character. The composite characters are<br><br>
formed through combination of Vowels, Matras, vowel modifiers, Halant, Invisible consonants and Nukta characters whose definitions are mentioned hereinbelow ;<br>
Vowels and Matras<br>
The ISCII code contains separate vowels and matras(vowel signs). While a vowel sign can be used independently, the matra sign is valid only after a consonant<br>
Vowel Modifiers<br>
After a consonant, vowels or matra character, a character can be used which modifies the vowel sound and is called a "vowel modifier"<br>
Halant<br>
The implicit vowel is a consonant can be removed by addition of a Halant sign. In a ISCII code conjuncts are formed by typing a Halant character between consonant. A conjunct may consist of upto 4 consonants joined by Halants. In practice, a Halant sign is shown only if the consonants do not change their shape by joining up<br>
Invisible consonant INV<br>
The INV (Invisible) code is used for formation of composite characters which require a consonantal base, but where the consonant itself ought to be invisible. There may be required only for some special display purposes<br>
Nukta character<br>
The Nukta consonants get formed by adding a Nukta character immediately after the<br>
appropriate consonant.<br>
In the ISCII code the same Nukta character is thought of as an operator to derive some of the<br>
lesser used Sanskrit characters.<br>
Vowels and Matras<br>
The ISCil code contains separate vowels and matras (vowel signs). While a vowel sign can<br>
be used independently, the matra sign is valid only after a consonant.<br>
Vowel Modifiers '<br>
After a consonant, vowels or matra character, a character can be used which modifies the<br>
vowel sound and is called a "vowel modifier".<br><br>
Halant<br>
The implicit vowel is a consonant can be removed by addition of a Halant sign. In a ISCII<br>
code conjuncts are formed by typing a Halant character between consonant. A conjunct may<br>
consist of upto 4 consonants joined by Halants. In practice, a Halant sign is shown only if the<br>
consonants do not change their shape by joining up.<br>
Invisible consonant INA<br>
The INV (Invisible) code is used for formation of composite characters which require a<br>
consonantal base, but where the consonant itself ought to be invisible. There may be required<br>
only for some special display purposes<br>
Nukta character<br>
The Nukta consonants get formed by adding a Nukta character immediately after the<br>
appropriate consonant.<br>
In the ISCII code the same Nukta character is thought of as an operator to derive some of the<br>
lesser used Sanskrit characters.<br>
The present ISFOC character pixel bits till the end of the present character pixel bits are<br>
completed.<br>
Repeat 2<br>
Else<br>
- Calculate full Composite character width for use in Bi-directional logic. - Transfer the present Character pixel date to IMAGE BUFFER for sending to the Print Head. -Gotol. End.<br>
The embedded logical codes (TLC) make possible to have multilingual printing having combination of four Brahmi languages such as Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Marati, Oriya, Assamese, Gujarati, Malayalam, Bengali etc apart from English in single printer. It also makes it possible to have a mixture of languages to be printed in the same line or text that will be very useful in some applications.<br><br>

For effecting bidirectional printing, the processor calculates the positional information of the next printing line in the reverse direction to position the carriage at that position, processes the characters in the reverse direction and fills the image buffer with the pixel information in the mirror image form of the character. The final positional information is calculated by taking width of individual characters as it scans each character-code that is received from computer system and residing in the Line Buffer. For Roman (English like) languages width of each character can be arrived at the same moment when character-code is scanned, as each character-code is independent by itself and does not depend on the next character-code(s), whereas for Brahmi (like Indian languages) or Persian languages, the width can be arrived only after processing and composing a full character that can be a combination of few character-codes. Hence the width information is possible to be arrived at a much later moment of logic processing. This variation has to co-exist along with that required for Roman languages. The innovation takes care of all such logical variations required at various stages of logic processing such a LINE EDIT, IMAGE EDIT, IMAGE BUFFER, PRINTING.<br>
Printing of Draft, Italics, Condensed-draft, Condensed-italics, LQ fonts, 10point and 12 point character sizes of languages is made possible by the invention.<br>
Printing of attributes such as Underline, Over-strike, Double-strike is made possible by the invention.<br><br>
Transliteration of text from one language to any other language is made possible by the invention and is very useful feature in the context of India and India like countries where many languages are prevalent.<br>
This is a unique invention where a single printer supports four Brahmi languages along with<br>
English having the combination of the above mentioned features. Sample Print-outs of 4<br>
languages (Devanagiri, Telugu, Tamil and Kannda are given in the accompanying drawings.<br>
This invention supports ISCII 91 and PC-ISCII Standards. In June 1999, the Tamil Nadu Government has adopted a new coding standard for the Tamil language. This standard is called as the Tamilnet99 standard. The invention has been enhanced to meet the Tamilnet99 standard. The Tamilnet99 standard can be invoked either from the Menu Mode(from the Printer) or by sending the codes ESC ~ t from the host. All features of the Printer that have been listed for ISCII 91 and PC-ISCII are applicable for Tamilnet99 standard also.<br>
Tabular Alignment implementation: GIST emulation<br>
The Indian language scripts are proportionally spaced. For any proportionally spaced character the vertical lines of a table will not get aligned. TVS-E has implemented an algorithm to circumvent the above problem. A brief description of the algorithm is as follows:<br>
1.	Check for a space character from the data that comes from the host.<br>
2.	If there is space character, print the next character( after the space) at a position as it would have printed for a 10 cpi character.<br>
The above can be invoked either through the Menu mode(from the printer) or by sending codes ESC-N.<br>
EA-ISCII<br>
English-Alphabet ISCII or EA-ISCII is meant for those computers and packages which do not allow use of 8-bit codes, or ISO compatible 7-bit codes. Here the Indian script characters have to be defined within the ASCII character set. By defining the Indian script alphabet in place of only 52 upper and lower case English alphabet, one can ensure the Indian scripts would be usable, wherever English alphabet can be used.<br>
Since all the ISCII characters can not be accommodated directly, the Nukta character is used to derive some of the lesser used ones.<br><br>
Since the same codes are now used to represent both the English and Indian script alphabet, some way of distinguishing between both is needed. A small "x" at the beginning of a word indicates that the word is an Indian script one. Very few words start with "x" in English and if necessary they can be written by doubling the V at the start. A stand-alone V continues to be displayed/printed normally. Similarly "-x" after an English word gets displayed/printed normally.<br>
EA-ISCII has been incorporated into this invention. EA-ISCII is automatically detected by the Printer if the Indian Language is selected.<br><br><br><br><br>
