DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to a stirring device for activated sludges contained in a basin<br>
comprising a stirring body (2) having a hyperboloid-like the stirring device shaped wall (3)<br>
attached to a shaft (1) and an air supply line (5, 8) running along the bottom (4) of the<br>
basin to supply air, wherein a vertical section (8) of the air supply line points to a funnellike<br>
recess (6) formed on an underside of the stirring body (2) characterized in that an<br>
opening of the recess (6) formed on the underside is covered with a covering element (7) in<br>
such a way that an annular gap (10) with a specified width remains free between a lower<br>
circumferential surface (9) of the stirring body (2) and the covering element (7), and that<br>
the vertical section (8) of the air supply line (8) is led coaxially through the covering<br>
element (7) in relation to the shaft (1).<br>
In an embodiment of the present disclosure further shear ribs (19) are provided on a<br>
radially outer section of an outer side of the further stirring body (18).<br>
In another embodiment of the present disclosure the shaft (1) is led through the stirring<br>
body (2) and is held on its one end in a safety bearing (13) provided in the covering<br>
element.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure the covering element is held rotatably<br>
in a safety bearing (13) surrounding the air supply line.<br>
The invention relates to a stirring device for activated sludges as defined in the preamble of<br>
claim 1.<br>
The object of the invention is to eliminate the disadvantages in accordance with prior art.<br>
In particular, a stirring device for activated sludges is to be specified with which air<br>
bubbles with a bubble size distribution as homogeneous as possible can be created in a<br>
liquid surrounding the stirring body.<br>
This object is solved by the features of claim 1. Useful embodiments of the invention result<br>
from the features of claims 2 to 13.<br>
4<br>
According to the provisions of the invention, it is provided that an opening of the recess<br>
formed on an underside is covered with a covering element in such a way that an annular<br>
gap with a specified width remains free between a lower circumferential surface of the<br>
stirring body and the covering element, and that the air supply line is led coaxially through<br>
the covering element in relation to the shaft. Due to the provision of the covering element<br>
suggested by the invention, the air supplied to the recess is now supplied through the<br>
annular gap in the area of a circumferential boundary of the stirring body. The formation of<br>
air bubbles with an undesirably large bubble diameter can be counteracted by suitable<br>
selection of the specified width of the annular gap. A particularly homogeneous bubble<br>
distribution in the liquid medium surrounding the stirring body can be created. Leading the<br>
air supply line coaxially in relation to the shaft through the covering element ensures that<br>
the air supplied to the recess essentially only escapes again through the annular gap. The<br>
size distribution of the air bubbles generated by the suggested stirring device is<br>
distinguished by a relatively small, average bubble diameter and by a monomodal size<br>
distribution.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the annular gap has a width in the range<br>
from 1 cm to 15 cm, preferably 2 to 10 cm. Moreover, essentially radially running shear<br>
ribs extending from a radially outer area of the lower circumferential surface can be<br>
provided. In this connection, a height of the shear ribs increases advantageously towards an<br>
outer circumferential boundary of the stirring body. The previously stated features further<br>
contribute to the making of a bubble-size distribution and a low average bubble diameter.<br>
The average bubble diameter can, for example, be in the range from 1 mm to 10 mm,<br>
preferably 2 mm to 8 mm.<br>
In a further advantageous feature, the covering element has a rotationally symmetrical<br>
shape. It can be a disk or a cone with its tip protruding into the recess or a hyperboloidtype<br>
body. A further outer circumferential boundary of the covering element can be<br>
toothed or also can have slits running radially towards the inside. In case of the<br>
embodiment of the covering element as a cone protruding into the recess or as a<br>
hyperboloid-like body, the volume of air in the recess can be small and an undesired<br>
buoyancy of the stirring body caused by this can be minimized. The suggested structures<br>
5<br>
on the further circumferential boundary of the covering element permit a particularly<br>
uniform air outlet throughout the entire circumferential boundary of the stirring body. A<br>
dispersion with a particularly homogeneous bubble size distribution can be generated with<br>
this throughout the entire circumference of the stirring body.<br>
In a first alternative embodiment, the covering element is firmly attached relative to the<br>
stirring body to a frame carrying the shaft or to a bottom of a basin. If the covering element<br>
is provided on a frame carrying the shaft, the stirring device can be designed completely as<br>
a mounting unit. In this connection, a motor to drive the shaft suspended thereon is<br>
provided on a tip of the frame which is usually designed like a tower and surrounds the<br>
stirring body. A height of the frame can be designed such that the motor is located either<br>
above a surface level of the liquid medium to be agitated, or also under a surface level of<br>
same. Reference is made to the disclosure of DE 42 18 027 A1 as well as the disclosure of<br>
DE 198 26 098 C2 which is herewith incorporated.<br>
To avoid an undesired precession movement of the shaft, it is useful to provide that the<br>
shaft is led through the stirring body and is held on its one end in a safety bearing provided<br>
in the covering element. In case of an embodiment of the covering element as a disk, the<br>
shaft can also be led through the disk and be held in a safety bearing provided underneath.<br>
In a second alternative embodiment, the covering element is firmly connected via<br>
connection means to the wall of the stirring body. In other words, in this case, the stirring<br>
body and the covering element form one unit. In this connection, the connection means can<br>
comprise essentially radially running bars extending from the inner side of the wall to an<br>
upper side of the covering element facing the recess. Such bars advantageously only extend<br>
over an outer radial section of the covering element. With the suggested second alternative<br>
embodiment, the covering element can be advantageously held rotatably in a safety bearing<br>
surrounding the air supply line.<br>
With a version of the second alternative embodiment, the covering element is designed as a<br>
hyperboloid-like further stirring body which is connected to the stirring body in such a way<br>
that its further tip points away from the recess of the hyperboloid-like stirring body. In<br>
6<br>
other words, the hyperboloid-like stirring body and the hyperboloid-like further stirring<br>
body are arranged mirror-symmetrically in relation to a rotational plane running vertically<br>
through the shaft. The suggested embodiment has the advantage that the covering element<br>
designed in the form of a hyperboloid-like further stirring body develops a current directed<br>
towards the further stirring body in the area of the bottom which current curves around this<br>
and is radially directed to the outside on its circumferential boundary. Undesired deposits<br>
in the area of the bottom of the basin are avoided by the formation of such a current.<br>
With the first stirring device shown in Fig. 1, a stirring body (2) is attached to a shaft (1).<br>
A wall (3) of the stirring body (2) has a hyperboloid-like shape. An air supply line (5) runs<br>
in the vicinity of a bottom (4) of a (not shown here) basin to supply air into a funnel-like<br>
recess (6) on an underside of the stirring body (2) opposite the bottom (4). An opening of<br>
the recess (6) facing the bottom (4) is covered with a disk (7). A vertically running section<br>
(8) of the air supply line (5) is led through a center of the disk (7). The disk (7) can be<br>
attached firmly or also rotatably to the vertically running section (8). Naturally, it is also<br>
possible that the disk is attached firmly on the bottom (4) via suitable support elements. In<br>
this embodiment, the disk (7) is either permanently or also freely rotatably supported<br>
relative to the stirring body (2). The suggested rotatability of the disk (7) helps to diminish<br>
a current resistance to a rotating current created by the stirring body (2).<br>
An annular gap (10) is formed between a lower circumferential surface (9) of the stirring<br>
body (2) and a first circumferential boundary of the disk (7). Essentially radially running<br>
first shear ribs (11) are provided in a radial section of the lower circumferential surface (9)<br>
located further outside. A height of the shear ribs (11) preferably increases in a direction<br>
pointing radially to the outside.<br>
The air supplied through the air supply line (5) is now forced through the annular gap (10)<br>
through the covering of the recess (6) via the disk (7). The escaping air is then distributed<br>
in the form of fine air bubbles in the surrounding liquid medium by the rotating stirring<br>
body (2), in particular the shear ribs (11) provided on the lower circumferential boundary<br>
(9).<br>
7<br>
With the second stirring device (2) shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, the disk (7) is firmly<br>
connected to an inner side of the wall (3) via connection bars (12) essentially extending in<br>
a radial direction. The disk (7) is in turn designed and/or arranged relative to a lower<br>
circumferential surface (9) of the stirring body (2) so that an annular gap (10) remains free.<br>
The vertical section (8) of the air supply line (5) is led through the center of the disk (7). A<br>
safety bearing (13) surrounding the vertical section (8) connects the disk (7) with the<br>
vertical section (8).<br>
Also with the second device shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, the air supplied into the recess (6)<br>
via the air supply line (5) essentially exits via the annular gap (10) in the vicinity of the<br>
lower circumferential surface (9) and is distributed finely into the surrounding liquid<br>
medium, in particular, due to the effect of the rotating shear ribs (11).<br>
In the exemplary embodiments shown, each recess (6) is covered with a disk (7). Instead of<br>
the disk (7), however, another differently designed means of covering can also be used. For<br>
example, it is possible to use cone-like or also hyperboloid-like formed covering means<br>
instead of the disk (7) so that only a gap for supplying the air to the annular gap (10)<br>
remains between an inner side of the wall (3) and the covering means. This can be used to<br>
minimize the buoyancy generated in the recess (6) by supplying the air.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic cross sectional view of a third stirring device. The third stirring<br>
device is designed similarly to the first stirring device. In this connection, however, the<br>
disk (7) is part of a base (14) - also disk-shaped - supported on the bottom (4). The air<br>
supply line (5) and the vertical section (8) of the air supply line (5) are affixed to the base<br>
(14) which is preferably made of concrete. A section of the shaft (1) which passes through<br>
the stirring body (2) is held rotatably in the safety bearing (13) surrounding the vertical<br>
section (8). In this case, the safety bearing (13) is usefully held in the base (14). The<br>
section of the shaft (1) passing through the stirring body (2) has ventilation openings (15)<br>
through which the air supplied into the recess (6) by the air supply line (5) is introduced.<br>
For this purpose, the section passing through the shaft (1) is provided with a separating<br>
wall (16).<br>
8<br>
The embodiment suggested here of the fixation of the air supply line (5) of the vertical<br>
section (8) as well as of the safety bearing (13) surrounding the vertical section (8) can<br>
naturally also be applied for the second stirring device. In order to keep a flow resistance<br>
as low as possible in this case, however, a sufficient distance must be provided between an<br>
underside of the disk (7) and an upper side of the base (14) facing the stirring body (2).<br>
Fig. 4 shows a fourth stirring device which is designed similarly to the third stirring device.<br>
Here, a further base (17) which can be made of concrete, for example, is designed in the<br>
form of a truncated cone whose tip protrudes into the recess (6). The safety bearing is<br>
provided in the area of the tip. Transport ribs (20) are attached to an outer side of the wall<br>
(3) pointing away from the recess (6), the height of whose ribs can increase in the direction<br>
of a circumferential boundary of the stirring body (2). The transport ribs (20) can also be<br>
curved in a top view (not shown here). Such transport ribs can naturally be used for the<br>
previously described embodiments.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a schematic cross sectional view of a fifth stirring device. Here, the covering<br>
element is designed in the form of a hyperboloid-like further stirring body (18) whose<br>
shape corresponds to the stirring body (2). The further stirring body (18) is firmly<br>
connected to the stirring body (2) via connection bars (12). A further tip of the further<br>
stirring body (18) is pointing away from the recess (6). In other words, the stirring body<br>
and the further stirring body are essentially arranged mirror-inverted in relation to a<br>
rotational plane. The safety bearing (13) is arranged in the area of the further tip of the<br>
further stirring body (18). Reference sign (19) designates further shear ribs which are<br>
provided on an outer side of the further stirring body (18) pointing away from the recess<br>
(6) in a radially outer section. The arrows S1, S2 suggest the direction of currents being<br>
created in the case of a rotation of the stirring bodies. By providing a covering configured<br>
in the form of a hyperboloid-like further stirring body (18), a lower flow S1 is generated in<br>
the vicinity of the bottom (4) which curves around in the area of the further stirring body<br>
(18) and points in a radially outer direction. In similar fashion an upper flow S2 curves<br>
around the stirring body (2) and also points in a direction pointing radially of the stirring<br>
body (2). - With the suggested embodiment, it is possible, on the one hand, to generate<br>
particularly fine air bubbles in the medium to be agitated and, on the other hand, to radially<br>
9<br>
transport these in the medium particular far away from the stirring body. Finally, an<br>
undesirable deposit of sediment on the bottom (4) of the basin can be avoided by the lower<br>
flow S1 being created.<br>
