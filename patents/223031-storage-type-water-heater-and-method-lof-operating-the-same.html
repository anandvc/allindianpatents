[0001]      This application claims the benefit of fee filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/448,245 filed on February 19,2003.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]      The invention relates to a water heater and method of operating the same.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]      In one embodiment, the invention provides a storage-type water heater including a<br>
water tank and a control system. The water tank las an inner surface and a vertical axis. The<br>
control system includes first and second electric-resistance heating elements coupled to the tank.<br>
The first and second heating elements include first and second thermal surfaces, respectively,<br>
disposed within the inner surface of the tank at fust and second locations, respectively. The<br>
control system also includes first, second, and tod temperatures sensors. The first and second<br>
temperature sensors are associated with the first and second heating elements, respectively. The<br>
third temperature sensor is coupled to the tank at a third location disposed vertically between the<br>
first and second locations.<br>
[0004]      The invention also provides a method of heating water stored by the storage-type<br>
water heater. In one embodiment, the method includes sensing a first temperature with the first<br>
temperature sensor; sensing a second temperature with the second temperature sensor;<br>
preventing power to the second heating element and controllably providing power to the first<br>
heating element if the first temperature is below a first set point, the second temperature is above<br>
a second set-point, and zero or more other conditions exist; preventing power to the first heating<br>
element and controllably providing power to the second heating element if the second<br>
temperature is below a second set point and zero or more other conditions exist; and preventing<br>
power to the first and second heating elements if the first and second temperatures are above the<br>
first and second set points, respectively, and zero or more other conditions exist.<br>

least a portion of the tank, and a control system comprising a moisture sensor disposed between<br>
the tank and the jacket. The control system is operable to prevent the heating element from<br>
heating the tank if the moisture sensor generates a moisture value greater than a threshold and<br>
zero or more other conditions exist In another construction, the control system can close a<br>
solenoid valve to prevent water from entering the tank.<br>
[0006]      The invention also provides a method of controlling the operation of a storage-type<br>
water heater. The method comprises controllably providing power to the first and second<br>
heating elements to heat water stored in the water tank; detecting the failure of one of the first<br>
and second heating elements; if detecting the failure of one of the first and second heating<br>
elements and zero or more other conditions exist, preventing power to the failed heating element,<br>
and controllably providing power to the non-failed heating element to heat water stored in the<br>
water tank.<br>
[0007]      Other aspects and embodiments of the invention will become apparent by<br>
consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0008]      The Figure is a schematic representation of a water heater incorporating the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009]      Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the<br>
arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following<br>
drawing. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being<br>
carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology<br>
used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of<br>
"including," "comprising," or "having? and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the<br>
items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Unless specified or<br>
limited otherwise, the terms "mounted," "connected," "supported," and "coupled" and variations<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/074748    -	PCT/US2004/004917<br>
thereof are used broadly and encompass both direct and indirect mountings, connections,<br>
supports, and couplings. Further, "connected" and "coupled" are not restricted to physical or<br>
mechanical connections or couplings.<br>
[0010]      As shown in the Figure, the water heater 10 has a water tank 15, an insulation jacket<br>
20 surrounding the tank 15, and water inlet and outlet spuds 25,30 respectively, for connection<br>
to a cold water supply and the hot water pipes of a building, respectively. For the construction<br>
shown, there are upper and lower (with respect to axis 32) electrical heating elements 35,40 in<br>
the respective upper and lower portions of the water tank 15. Other constructions of the water<br>
heater can include a different number of heating elements and the location of the elements may<br>
vary. The water heater 10 also has a control system that includes four temperature sensors 45,<br>
50, 55, 60, two water sensors 65,70, a current sensor 75 on the power circuit, a switch box or<br>
module 80, and an operator panel 85. Other constructions of the water heater can include<br>
different or additional control sensors, and it should be understood that not all of the control<br>
sensors shown are required for all constructions.<br>
[0011J      Referring again to the construction shown in the Figure, the control sensors (i.e., all<br>
of the sensors in the control system), heating element connections, and all associated<br>
interconnections are located in the insulation space between the tank 15 and the outer protective<br>
jacket 20. The temperature sensors 45,50,55,60 are respectively positioned just above the<br>
lower heating element 40, between the upper and lower heating elements 35,40, just above the<br>
upper heating element 35, and near the top of the tank 15. The temperature sensors are in<br>
intimate contact with the tank walls, and may be, for example, thermistor type sensors.<br>
[0012]      In the construction shown, sensors 55 and 45 are used to control the upper and lower<br>
heating elements 35,40, respectively. Sensor 50 is used to determine the need for automatic<br>
boost For example, this sensor 50 could be used to detect an excessive drawoff situation. The<br>
control system could have an algorithm to detect this situation and initiate a heating pattern<br>
(earlier actuation of the upper heating element than would normally occur with only an upper<br>
and lower temperature sensor).  This can result in a fester hot water recovery time in the water<br>
heater. Sensor 60 is used to monitor the temperature of the hottest water in the tank 15 in a<br>
dedicated high limit circuit.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/074748	PCT/US2004/004917<br>
relay and the manual switch define a double pole circuit for isolation of the electric power supply<br>
to the water heater 10. In the event of an over temperature situation, both poles of the supply to<br>
the water heater are interrupted Referring again to the Figure, there are also heating element<br>
relay switches (e.g., electronic relay switches, electromechanical relay switches, or a<br>
combination thereof) in the switch box 80 for controlling power to the upper and lower heating<br>
elements 35,40. The heating element relay switches are capable of switching 30 amps at 240<br>
volts.<br>
[0016]      The operator panel 85 shown in the Figure includes a programmable central<br>
processing unit (CPU) that controls the operation of the control system. However, other<br>
programmable devices and/or processing or control units or circuits can be used with the water<br>
heater 10. The operator panel 85 operates on utility power, but also includes a battery backup<br>
power source for program retention in the event of a power failure. The operator panel 85 may<br>
be mounted on the water heater jacket 20, remotely from the water heater 10 in the same room<br>
(e.g., on a wall), in another room in the building, or even outside of the building. The interface<br>
between the switch box 80 and the user interface panel 85 may include a 2-wire bus system, a 4-<br>
wire bus system, or a radio wave signal.<br>
[0017]      The CPU is programmable via a user interface on the operator panel 85. The user<br>
interface includes a touch pad or keyboard and a visual display, both of which are backlit for<br>
ease of operation. Using the interface, the operator may set an "OFF" temperature within a<br>
permissible range (e.g., 90-150Â° F for residential applications and 90-180Â° F for commercial<br>
applications), and an "ON*' temperature that, in one construction, must be at least 3Â° F below the<br>
OFF temperature. As the names imply, the OFF temperature is the temperature at which the<br>
control system turns the heating elements 35,40 OFF, and the ON temperature is the temperature<br>
at which the control system turns one of the heating elements 35,40 ON. In some constructions,<br>
the heating elements 35,40 have different ON and/or OFF temperatures.<br>
[0018] The ON/OFF program may, for example, define a 24 hour, 7 day schedule or a 24<br>
hour, 5 weekday and 2 weekend day schedule, any of which can define multiple ON and OFF<br>
temperatures. The operator may manually override the ON/OFF program. The CPU also<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/074748	*	PCT/US2004/004917<br>
accommodates vacation programming, in which the control system reduces the water<br>
temperature for the duration specified by the operator.<br>
[0019]      The CPU is additionally programmed to automatically accommodate excessive draw<br>
off situations (i.e., when the temperature of the water is reduced rapidly over a short time period)<br>
by going into boost mode to decrease the recovery time (i.e., make the water heater 10 recover<br>
from excessive draws faster). In boost mode, the control system energizes the upper heating<br>
element instead of the lower heating element to quickly boost the water temperature at the top of<br>
the tank 15. Once the upper heating element 35 reaches its set point, which may be set at a<br>
higher temperature (such as the highest set point temperature for the current 24 hour period) than<br>
the normal ON temperature for the upper heating element 35, normal automatic operation of the<br>
heating system will resume.<br>
[0020]      The operator panel 85 also provides a switch for manually switching the control<br>
system into boost mode. This will allow the user to initiate a heating sequence that wiU reset the<br>
thermostat set point to the highest programmed value for the day, which, if the water temperature<br>
is below this value, will force the water heater ON. Once the set point is achieved, the<br>
thermostat will automatically reset to the programmed value and normal heater operation will<br>
resume.<br>
[0021]      The operator panel 85 includes indicators for the mode of the control system (e.g.,<br>
manual, automatic, boost, or vacation). It also includes a "power on" indicator and an indicator<br>
for each heating element 35,40 to indicate whether the element is active. Such indicators would<br>
aid both the installer and the end user. The operator panel 85 also includes a port (e.g., an RS232<br>
port) for computer hookup.<br>
[0022]      In the construction shown, the control system prevents simultaneous operation of the<br>
upper and lower heating elements 35,40. In one method of operation, the CPU uses the<br>
following control sequence. If the temperature sensor 55 is below the set point of the upper<br>
heating element 35, output to the lower element 40 is disabled and the upper element 35 is turned<br>
ON. if the temperature sensor 55 is above the set point of the upper heating element 35, and<br>
temperature sensor 45 is below the set point of the lower element 40, the lower element 40 is<br>
turned ON. If the temperature sensor 45 is above the set point of the lower heating element 40,<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/074748         -	PCT/US2004/004917<br>
both outputs are turned OFF. If the temperature sensor 50 senses a rapid temperature drop, the<br>
lower element 45 is disabled and the upper element 35 is turned ON in the automatic boost<br>
mode. Other methods for controlling the elements 35 and 40 are possible.<br>
[0023]      The operator panel 85 provides troubleshooting and error detection features, which<br>
use the above-described control sensors to detect problems, and announce the problem to the<br>
operator via the visual display and/or an alarm (sound and/or lights). For example, when the<br>
control system detects that one of the heating elements 35,40 has failed, it switches power to the<br>
other heating element and alerts the operator of the failure. The control system may detect such<br>
failure (1) when no current is sensed in the element circuit despite the associated sensor (55,45)<br>
being below its set point, (2) when the measured resistance in the element indicates an open<br>
circuit element, or (3) when current is sensed and no temperature rise is sensed in the tank 15 in a<br>
defined time period. The system will also monitor the heating elements 35,40 for scale buildup.<br>
If the rate of change of resistance in the heating elements or heat up rate indicate excessive scale<br>
on the element, the operator will be notified by a display and/or an alarm.<br>
[0024]      The control system will, in addition to alerting the operator, shut down the water<br>
heater 10 when the water sensors 65,70 detect a water leak, when the control system detects dry<br>
fire (i.e., one of the heating elements 35,40 being energized in the absence of water in the tank<br>
15), when the current sensor 15 detects current leak to ground, and when the current sensor 75<br>
detects that the water heater 10 is not grounded. Dry fire is detected when there are abnormal<br>
current and resistance readings in the heating element circuit. Current to ground occurs when<br>
there is no voltage potential on one leg of the power supply circuit due to current leakage to the<br>
heating elements 35,40.<br>
[0025]      The control would incorporate a voltage sensor on each of the incoming powered<br>
leads with the ability to measure voltage potential to chassis ground. If no (or a threshold value<br>
to be determined) voltage potential to ground exists on both legs of the incoming powered leads,<br>
the building circuit is not properly grounded. The control would have an algorithm to detect this<br>
condition and turn off the electrical input to the heater and/or alert the owner that an unsafe<br>
(ungrounded) situation exists.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/074748	PCTVUS2004/004917<br>
[0026]      The control system knows that the heier 10 is not grounded when there is no voltage<br>
potential on both legs of the power supply circuit<br>
[0027]      The control system also incorporates ai electrical output for control of an optional<br>
electric solenoid valve 90 on the incoming water mpply. This optional valve will be closed upon<br>
detection of certain conditions and appropriate mentoring signals to prevent water damage to the<br>
building from leakage or to prevent a safety hazad to user.<br>
[0028]       An additional feature of the control s^tem is the ability to measure and monitor<br>
power consumption. Power consumption is a function of the wattage of an electric heating<br>
element and the time during which it is under power. The CPU is able to keep track of the time<br>
portion of the power consumption equation, but tie OEM or operator is required to program the<br>
wattage of the heating elements 35,40 for the feature to work properly. The control system<br>
displays the power consumption of the water heater on the visual display of the user interface 85.<br>
[0029]      Along with the current sensor to the conductor on each heating element, the control<br>
incorporates a timer which increments with current flow to the heating elements, i.e., when<br>
current is flowing the timer would increment. With heating element wattage input to the<br>
controller, the controller would have an algorithm to calculate and store power consumption.<br>
This power consumption could be continual or reset daily, monthly, annually, or on any time<br>
frame chosen by the user,<br>
[0030]      The control system also includes a voltage sensor on each of the incoming powered<br>
leads with the ability to measure voltage potential to chassis ground. If either no voltage potential<br>
to ground exists on both legs of the incoming powered leads, or if the voltage potential drops<br>
below a threshold value, the building circuit is not properly grounded. The control has an<br>
algorithm to detect this condition and turn off the electrical input to the heater and/or alert the<br>
owner that an unsafe (ungrounded) situation exists.<br>
[0031]      With a voltage sensor on each of the incoming powered leads and a current sensor on<br>
the conductor to each heating element, the controller has an algorithm capable of continually<br>
calculating the "hot* (while under load) resistance of each heating element. The controller<br>
calculates this resistance when the heating element is initially energized, as a baseline, and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/074748	PCT/US2004/004917<br>
continually monitors tbe resistance for comparison to this initial resistance. This ability allows<br>
detection of a dry-fire condition (energization of a heating element with no water in the tank) as<br>
well as scale buildup on the element. The control contains an algorithm capable of detecting a<br>
resistance pattern indicative of a dry-fired element and a resistance pattern indicative of<br>
excessive scale buildup on the heating element. In either event, the control alerts the owner that<br>
the tank contains no water or that the heating element is facing imminent failure.<br>
[0032]      The algorithms for detecting dry-fire and scale buildup take into consideration the<br>
rate of change of resistance as a function of time, and compare that rate of change of resistance<br>
to the characteristics of the brand-new, clean heating element baseline information. A heating<br>
element may burn out in within one to two minutes of dry-firing. The algorithm for determining<br>
the dry-fire condition may, for example, be based on the rate of increase in resistance over the<br>
first few seconds or less of element operation (e.g., a 3-10% increase in resistance in the first 2-<br>
10 seconds). For some heating elements, for example, a 5% increase in resistance in the first<br>
three seconds of element operation may be a good indicator of dry-firing. Early detection of dry-<br>
firing permits the control to save the heating element by shutting it down quickly.<br>
[0033]      Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a new and useful water heater and<br>
method of operating a water heater. The constructions of the water heater and the methods of<br>
operating the water heater described above and illustrated in the figure are presented by way of<br>
example only and are not intended as a limitation upon the concepts and principles of the<br>
invention. Various features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the following claims.<br>
