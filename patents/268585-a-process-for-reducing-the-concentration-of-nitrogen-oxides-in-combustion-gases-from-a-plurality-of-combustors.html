				<td>United States Patent Application<br>
Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction Process And Control System<br>
Related Application<br>
[000] This application is a continuation of copending US Provisional Application SN 60986917,<br>
filed November 9, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001] The invention relates generally to the efficient utilization of urea for selective catalytic<br>
reduction (SCR) of NOx, and more particularly to feeding a gasified product of the urea to feed<br>
multiple turbine power units from a single unit, which converts urea to ammonia-containing<br>
SCR reagent yet maintains the ability to fully control separate SCR units without excessive<br>
reagent usage or loss of pollution control effectiveness.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[002] The use of turbines to generate power is economical in many situations where more<br>
conventional powerplants cannot be contemplated. To their great credit, they generally<br>
operate with minimal generation of NOx and can utilize fuels, such as digester and landfill gases.<br>
However, they do generate regulatory significant amounts of NOx, and efforts are made to<br>
reduce emissions to even lower levels.<br>
[003] Digester and landfill gases are gaseous by-products, principally comprised of methane<br>
and carbon dioxide, of anaerobic decomposition of organic materials from sewage treatment or<br>
landfills. These are not clean fuels according to criteria that utilities normally consider. Trace<br>
quantities of offensive compounds are typically found in the gases and often include hydrogen<br>
sulfide, ammonia and acid gas forming compounds. In addition, some compounds present in<br>
the gas and are known to clog NOx reduction catalysts and shorten the life of the turbines. The<br>
net effect for operators is that utilization of this low-cost fuel can present additional costs in<br>
terms of shortened turbine life, corroded ductwork and fouled catalysts.<br>
[004] Unless these costs can be recovered by taking good advantage of the energy value of<br>
these fuels, the environment will suffer and their energy value will likely be replaced with<br>
imported petroleum. It is, therefore, advantageous that all costs be recovered by the facility<br>
operators, burned in combustion devices such as turbines to either generate electricity or<br>
directly power equipment, and treated by suitable NOx reduction technology, the best of which is<br>
SCR if it can be done effectively without storing dangerous ammonia in a system which is as<br>
flexible as the power grid is to energy demand.<br>
[005] SCR has been proven to be highly effective at NOx reduction, and SCR units can generally<br>
be scaled to the size required for turbines. However, SCR units typically require the use of<br>
ammonia as a reducing reagent, and it is a common problem that ammonia is difficult and<br>
dangerous to store, especially in populated areas. Thus, the use of ammonia generators such as<br>
described in U. S. Patent No. 7,090,810 to Sun, ef a/., and U. S. Patent No. 6,077,491 to Cooper,<br>
et a\., are often required, but their control for multiple turbine units has not been addressed and<br>
can be more costly or difficult than economics may permit in some installations, such as turbines<br>
for use with digester and landfill gases.<br>
[006] The digester and landfill gases, which have more traditionally been burned by a flare<br>
because of the low quality of the gases, can create costs that are difficult to recover. For these<br>
gases, the problem of economics is especially great. Installations requiring more than one turbine<br>
cannot presently benefit from a single urea-based ammonia SCR plant. Unfortunately, it has been<br>
seen that utilization of a single urea conversion unit for each turbine is the most practical<br>
approach.<br>
[007] However, because the demand on the turbines for power fluctuates over time - with<br>
daily and seasonal fluctuations - single ammonia generators have not been practical. SCR units<br>
typically employ ammonia injection grids (AIGs), which are essentially arrays of distribution pipes<br>
with holes arranged through which the ammonia is preferably ejected with a carrier gas to<br>
provide sufficient momentum for the gas at each location and thereby achieve uniform<br>
distribution of ammonia. When demand is low, immediate decrease of ammonia to one SCR unit<br>
for one turbine, will create a temporary excess of ammonia for the others. Without employing<br>
storage tanks, which is to avoided for ammonia safety reasons, there is currently no good way to<br>
accommodate the fluctuations. Distribution will be adversely affected or excess ammonia will be<br>
supplied and result in ammonia slip.<br>
[008] There is a present need for a process, apparatus and system for efficient utilization of<br>
urea for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, and more particularly for feeding a gasified<br>
product of the urea to multiple turbine power units from a single urea gasification unit.<br>
[009] There is a particular need for such a system which converts urea to ammonia, yet<br>
maintains the ability to fully control separate SCR units without excessive reagent usage or loss<br>
of pollution control effectiveness.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[010] The present invention provides a process for reducing the concentration of nitrogen<br>
oxides in combustion gases from a plurality of turbines or other combustors, each of which has<br>
an associated selective catalytic NOx reduction catalyst effective for utilizing gasified urea, the<br>
process comprising: heating aqueous urea at conditions of temperature and pressure for a time<br>
effective to gasify the urea and water by mixing the aqueous urea with a heated gas stream in<br>
amounts relative to the amounts of urea and water to produce a first gasified reductant stream<br>
comprising a predetermined mass and concentration of ammonia; monitoring the demand for<br>
urea at each of the plurality of turbines; feeding the first gasified reductant stream to each<br>
turbine at a rate sufficient to supply gasified reductant to supply the monitored demand to the<br>
selective catalytic NOx reduction catalyst associated with each turbine; determining an amount of<br>
carrier gas needed to achieve a predetermined degree of mixing of the gasified reagent with<br>
combustion gases generated at each turbine; based on this determination, admixing a<br>
determined amount of carrier gas with the first gasified reductant stream to provide a catalyst<br>
feed stream associated with each turbine; and at each turbine, introducing an associated catalyst<br>
feed stream by means of an ammonia injection grid to the combustion gases upstream of the<br>
catalyst under conditions effective to reduce the concentration of NOx in the effluent from each<br>
turbine.<br>
[011] The invention also comprises the system and apparatus described and illustrated for<br>
accomplishing the process as described and reasonable variations of it.<br>
Description of the Drawings<br>
[012] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the<br>
specification, illustrate presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and together with the<br>
general description given above and the detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
given below, serve to explain the principles of the invention. As shown throughout the drawings,<br>
like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts.<br>
[013] Fig. 1 is a schematic flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of the process and system<br>
of the invention.<br>

gasified reductant in accord with the invention.<br>
[015] Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram on one form of ammonia injection grid the operation of<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[016] In describing the present invention, reference is made to the drawings, wherein there<br>
is seen a preferred embodiment shown schematically in Fig. 1. The drawing and the process it<br>
represents will be described briefly below, without undue recitation of sensors, pumps,<br>
indicators, transmitters, valves, pumps, and the like which are so well known to those skilled in<br>
engineering systems of this type. Various labels are used in the drawings to have the meanings as<br>
follows: TE = temperature element/sensor, LT = level transmitter/sensor, VFD = variable<br>
frequency drive, SC = speed control, PI = pressure indicator/sensor, Tl = temperature<br>
indicator/sensor, FT = flow transmitter, l/P - current to pressure transducer, FIT = flow indicating<br>
transmitter, M = flowmeter, PLC = programmable logic controller.<br>
[017] With reference to Fig. 1, a feed line 12 leads to urea tank 14 to maintain a sufficient<br>
supply of an aqueous solution of urea or like chemical as described in United States Patent No.<br>
7,090,810, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The process is effective<br>
with urea, but can utilize other NOx-reducing reagents capable of generating a reactant gas<br>
containing ammonia upon heating. As will be clear from the following, when certain of these<br>
reagents are gasified, the reactant gas will also contain HNCO which reacts with water to convert<br>
to ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is an advantage of the invention that this can be easily<br>
achieved without prehydrolysis of the NOx-reducing reagent which has the attendant risk of<br>
plugging nozzles and other equipment. By the term "gasification" we mean that substantially all<br>
of the urea is converted into a gas, leaving no significant dissolved or free solids or liquid to<br>
contact with and foul SCR catalysts.<br>
[018] The term "urea" is meant to include the reagents that are equivalent to urea in the<br>
sense that they form ammonia and HNCO when heated, whether or not they contain large<br>
amounts of the pure chemical urea in the form introduced into the combustion gases; however,<br>
the reagents that are equivalent to urea typically contain measurable quantities of urea in their<br>
commercial forms and thus comprise urea. Among the NOx-reducing reagents that can be<br>
gasified are those that comprise a member selected from the group consisting of: ammelide;<br>
ammeline; ammonium carbonate; ammonium bicarbonate; ammonium carbamate; ammonium<br>
cyanate; ammonium salts of inorganic acids, including sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid;<br>
ammonium salts of organic acids, including formic and acetic acid; biuret; triuret, cyanuric acid;<br>
isocyanicacid; urea formaldehyde; melamine; tricyanourea and mixtures of any number of these.<br>
Yet other NCvreducing reagents are available that do not form HNCO, but decompose to a<br>
mixture of gases including hydrocarbons. Among this group are various amines and their salts<br>
(especially their carbonates), including guanidine, guanidine carbonate, methyl amine carbonate,<br>
ethyl amine carbonate, dimethyl amine carbonate, hexamethylamine; hexamethylamine<br>
carbonate; and byproduct wastes containing urea from a chemical process. Amines with higher<br>
alkyls can be employed to the extent that the hydrocarbon components released do not interfere<br>
with the NOx-reduction reaction. The term "urea" is thus meant to encompass urea in all of its<br>
commercial and equivalent forms. Typically, commercial forms of urea will consist essentially of<br>
urea, containing 95% or more urea by weight. This relatively pure form of urea is preferred and<br>
has several advantages in the process of the invention. It is preferably supplied to tank 14 at a<br>
concentration of from about 10 to about 50%, with about 30 to about 35%.<br>
[019] A level sensor and feed pump arrangement assure that sufficient urea solution will<br>
always be present in the tank 14 to meet programmed demand. From the tank 14, which can be<br>
heated to facilitate low temperature operation, the urea solution flows via line 16 assisted by<br>
metering pump 18 and flow monitor 20 to line 22 for introduction through injector nozzle 24,<br>
which with the aid of air from line 26, atomizes the aqueous urea solution for its gasification in<br>
gasification chamber 28. The gasification of the urea is facilitated with heated air from line 34<br>
which passes it to heater 36 and line 38 and auxiliary heater 39 for supply to chamber 28. In<br>
chamber 28, the aqueous urea solution is heated at conditions of temperature (e.g., from about<br>
175° to about 650°C) and pressure (e.g., at near atmospheric, say from about 0.5 to about 1.5<br>
atm) for a time effective to gasify the urea and water by mixing the aqueous urea with the<br>
heated gas stream from line 38 in amounts relative to the amounts of urea and water to produce<br>
a first gasified reductant stream comprising a predetermined concentration of ammonia. A<br>
typical gas stream will contain from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight ammonia. In some<br>
embodiments, an air line 30 can be employed to aspirate the nozzle 24 during cleaning. The<br>
gasified urea solution, also called gasified reductant, is withdrawn from chamber 28 via line 40<br>
for distribution as a first gasified reductant stream to supply lines 42 serving the SCR units<br>
associated with each of the turbines as will be describe more below.<br>
[020] The demand for urea is monitored by sensors at each of the plurality of turbines by<br>
sensing at least one control parameter of the combustion gases from a turbine which is indicative<br>
of the NOx in the combustion gases and determining the demand by control programmable logic<br>
controller 43 or other like device. The controller can be feed forward with or without feedback.<br>
The first gasified reductant stream is fed to each turbine via individual lines 42, utilizing control<br>
valves and flow monitors shown generally as 44 and 44', respectively, at a rate sufficient to<br>
supply gasified reductant to supply the monitored demand to the selective catalytic NOx<br>
reduction catalyst associated with each turbine. Because the turbines will have different<br>
requirements for NOx reduction due to their loads, fuels supplied or other factors, and because<br>
the gasified reductant must be uniformly dispersed within the combustion gases, normal<br>
ammonia injection grids, AIGs, will not provide the desired distribution with effective reagent<br>
utilization.<br>
[021] Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of a single turbine with an SCR unit supplied with<br>
gasified reductant in accord with the invention. The turbine 70 is fed fuel from line 72 and air<br>
from line 74 and generates combustion gases 76 which pass into SCR unit 78 where they are<br>
treated according to the invention and then exhausted to stack 80.<br>
[022] Fig. 3 shows one form of AIG, ammonia injection grid 62, the operation of which in an SCR<br>
system that can be improved according to the invention. Such grids will generally have an array<br>
of pipes 63 with an array of holes 64 through which the gasified reagent is distributed to the<br>
combustion gases from the associated turbine. The SCR unit includes an AIG, ammonia injection<br>
grid, 62 fed gasified reagent via line 60.<br>
[023] An in-line mixing device 65 is typically provided for assuring good mixing of the gasified<br>
reagent with the combustion gases. Then, the gases are passed through a series of catalysts<br>
effective for selective catalytic reduction of NOx at the designed temperatures of the system at<br>
this point.<br>
[024] Referring again to Fig. 1, it can be seen that the gasified reagent is passed via line 40 to<br>
individual lines 42 to be mixed with a sufficient amount of carrier gas so that the correct dosing<br>
of gasified reagents can be utilized and mixed with sufficient carrier gas to achieve the correct<br>
mass flow rate and velocity profile for the reducing gas when introduced into the SCR unit 78 by<br>
means of an injection grid 62.<br>
[025] A separate supply system is provided for providing carrier gas to each individual turbine.<br>
Fig. 1 shows air introduced via line 45 and blower 46 to heater 48 and line 50. The rates of supply<br>
and degrees of heating can be controlled by appropriate sensors via controller 43 using<br>
instrument air 43' or equivalent. Because the load of one or more turbines may not be high<br>
enough to require sufficient ammonia that the flow through a feed line 42 maintains it at the<br>
proper temperature, it is important that heater 48 be employed to maintain the temperature of<br>
the gasified reagent in line 60.<br>
[026] To achieve the advantages of the invention, the controller 43 or other logic device will<br>
determie the amount of carrier gas needed to achieve a predetermined degree of mixing of the<br>
gasified reagent with combustion gases generated at each turbine. Then, based on this<br>
determination, a determined amount of carrier gas from supply line 50 and individual lines 52 is<br>
admixed with the first gasified reductant stream from lines 40, 42 to provide a catalyst feed<br>
stream associated with each turbine and which can be fed to the turbine via a line 60. Then, at<br>
each turbine 70, an associated catalyst feed stream 60 is introduced by means of an ammonia<br>
injection grid 62 to the combustion gases upstream of the catalyst 66 under conditions effective<br>
to reduce the concentration of NOx in the effluent from each turbine. Similarly as with supply of<br>
the first gasified reductant stream via individual lines 42, lines 52 can utilize control valves and<br>
flow monitors shown generally as 54 and 54', respectively to control the rate sufficient to supply<br>
a catalyst feed stream with the necessary mass and flow rate to each turbine.<br>
[027] It is an advantage of the invention that a gasified product of urea can be fed with the<br>
ability to fully control separate SCR units without excessive reagent usage or loss of pollution<br>
control effectiveness. The controller 43 can determine the amount of reagent required for each<br>
turbine to control NOx emissions and then direct mixing the gasified urea with the correct<br>
amount of carrier gas for efficient operation of each separate SCR unit despite the demand<br>
variation between the turbines. In this manner the gasification unit can be properly controlled to<br>
provide urea on demand without the need for storing large inventories of ammonia-containing<br>
gasses to correct for fluctuations in demand. While the description exemplifies turbines due to<br>
the special effectiveness and importance of the invention in that context, it will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art that its advantages can be extended to other types of combustors,<br>
including furnaces, boilers, engines, incinerators and the like. It is another advantage of the<br>
invention that the temperature of the gasified reagent in line 60 can be maintained at a<br>
sufficient temperature to prevent condensation or chemical reactions even when the load of one<br>
or more turbines may not be high enough for sufficient mass flow through a feed line 42.<br>
[028] The above description is for the purpose of teaching the person of ordinary skill in the<br>
art how to practice the invention. It is not intended to detail all of those obvious modifications<br>
and variations, which will become apparent to the skilled worker upon reading the description. It<br>
is intended, however, that all such obvious modifications and variations be included within the<br>
scope of the invention which is defined by the following claims. The claims are meant to cover<br>
the claimed components and steps in any sequence which is effective to meet the objectives<br>
there intended, unless the context specifically indicates the contrary.<br>
