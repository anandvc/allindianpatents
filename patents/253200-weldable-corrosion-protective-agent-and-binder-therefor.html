				<td>Weldable Corrosion-protective agent and Binder Therefor<br>
The present invention relates to a corrosion-protective agent for metal surfaces which<br>
is preferably weldable, and to a binder therefor and a coated workpiece.<br>
There are stringent requirements on corrosion-protective agents which are weldable.<br>
They should be easily coated on the metal surface of the workpieces, they should<br>
afford reliable corrosion protection, and they should not cause a weakening of the<br>
weld seam when the workpieces are welded together.<br>
Weldable corrosion-protective agents containing zinc particles and organic or<br>
inorganic binders are well known. These corrosion-protective agents are either based<br>
on water or on organic solvents. Aqueous corrosion-protective agents are clearly<br>
preferred due to their safe processing.<br>
Typical examples of weldable corrosion-protective agents are described in patent<br>
applications DE 197 48 764, DE 199 51 133 and DE 100 22 075 (Henkel). An organic<br>
binder in an aqueous solution always has a powdery metal and a so-called corrosion<br>
protection pigment added to it. If required, mixtures of solvents are used instead of<br>
water. Epoxy resins, as well as blocked PU resins, are amongst the organic binders.<br>
If required, hardening agents for the binders are added to the corrosion-protective<br>
agent. With these formulae it has been found to be disadvantageous for the<br>
corrosion-protective agents to have an insulating effect on the coated workpiece so<br>
that welding is made more difficult. For welding it has turned out that ensuring<br>
conductivity with organic binders to achieve a quick, complete and flawless welded<br>
connection is problematic.<br>
Other binders which are largely inorganic, such as on the basis of titanates and<br>
silanes, have slightly improved conductivity. However, the binder still has an<br>
insulating effect between the corrosion-protective particles. JP2004-04358A<br>
describes a coating agent for forming an antireflection film. It contains a fluorine-<br><br>
-2-<br>
containing copolymer dissolved in a solvent. The coating agent described there is not<br>
suitable for corrosion protection, in particular not suitable for a weldable corrosion-<br>
protective agent.<br>
WO 02/100151 (Adsil) describes a coating wherein the condensation of a silane,<br>
amongst others, is catalyzed by small amounts of a metal alcohol. The coating agent<br>
can contain PTFE as a hard lubricant, if contact-repellent surfaces are to be created.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a suitable binder for a<br>
corrosion-protective agent, in particular a weldable corrosion-protective agent, and a<br>
corrosion-protective agent, in particular a weldable corrosion-protective agent which<br>
ensures a reliable and secure weld connection while remaining simple to process.<br>
This object has been solved by a binder according to claim 1 and a corrosion-<br>
protective agent according to claims 23 and 24, and by a workpiece according to<br>
claim 30.<br>
A binder according to the present invention has the following components: at least<br>
one titanium and/or one zirconium compound, at least one organofunctional silane<br>
and a solvent and at least one fluorinated polymer, which is insoluble in the solvent of<br>
the binder, and wherein the titanium and/or one zirconium compound is used in an<br>
amount of at least 0.5% by weight with reference to 100% by weight of the binder.<br>
The fluorinated polymer added as a solid is of importance, in particular, for good<br>
weldability of metallic workpieces which are coated with this binder or with corrosion-<br>
protective agents made therefrom, in particular weldable corrosion-protective agents.<br>
Even two workpieces coated on both sides can be easily welded if weldable<br>
corrosion-protective agents are manufactured using the binder according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The use of titanates and/or zirconates has been found useful according to the<br>
present invention, since titanates and zirconates, apart from the well known excellent<br>
properties of adhesion promotion, apparently increase the conductivity of the binder<br>
or the corrosion-protective agent when the welding temperature is reached. This can<br>
be due to the fact that some titanium and/or zirconium compounds - only titanium<br>
oxides need be mentioned - exhibit semiconductor properties in the anastatic state.<br><br>
-3-<br>
To enhance conductivity, preferably titanates and/or zirconates, particularly<br>
preferably organic titanates or zirconates are used. Chelates, in particular, are<br>
suitable for use in binders. Mixtures of different organic titanates and/or zirconates<br>
can also be suitably used.<br>
The titanium and/or zirconium compounds are used in an amount of 0.5 weight % to<br>
95 weight % with respect to the binder. For the preferred embodiments of the binder,<br>
at least 3 weight %, in particular at least 5 weight %, preferably at least 10 weight %,<br>
particularly preferably at least 12 weight %, advantageously at least 15 weight % of<br>
the metal compound are used. It has been found advantageous to use up to 80<br>
weight %, particularly preferably up to 70 weight %, preferably up to 50 weight %,<br>
advantageously up to 40 weight %, each with respect to the binder.<br>
Organofunctional silanes or mono silanes are known as components of binders.<br>
According to a further development, preferably methylphenyl -, phenyl - and methyl<br>
silicone resins are used in the binder according to the present invention. Silicone<br>
resins with vinyl or aliyl groups, acryl esters, ethyleneimino groups, fluorinated phenyl<br>
residues, fluorine derivates, hydroxyorgano groups, carboxyorgano groups,<br>
aminoalcyl groups, siloxane-silazane mixed polymerisates, silane compounds with<br>
phenylene groups or with co-condensation products with organic resins can also be<br>
considered. Mixtures of the above-mentioned silane compounds are also possible.<br>
The at least one organofunctional silane or the at least one organofunctional<br>
monosilane is preferably chosen such that its decomposition temperature is below<br>
the welding temperature. The organofunctional silane is therefore largely<br>
decomposed before or at the latest at the point where the welding temperature is<br>
reached. The substantial or complete decomposition of the silane contributes to the<br>
formation of a uniform welding seam. The organofunctional silane is used preferably<br>
in an amount of 0.01 weight % to 20 weight % with respect to the binder. The use of<br>
more than 2 weight %, preferably of more than 5 weight % is advantageous.<br>
According to a suitable embodiment of the present invention, formulae contain up to<br>
15 weight %, particularly advantageously up to 12 weight %, up to 10 weight % of the<br>
organofunctional silane are preferably used, particularly preferably up to 7 weight %,<br>
each with respect to the binder. Each amount of the organofunctional silane or the<br><br>
-4-<br>
mixture of organofunctional silanes to be used depends on each intended application<br>
and the requirements on the processing of the binder.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the binder has an organic solvent or a<br>
mixture of organic solvents. Alcohols, aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbons and<br>
esters are particularly suitable.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that solid fluorinated polymers insoluble in the solvent<br>
of the binder have a binding behavior unlike that of the usual binders or polymers.<br>
Such insoluble fluohnated polymers do not uniformly spread on all surfaces, in<br>
particular not on metallic surfaces. They therefore have a tendency to set in the form<br>
of insulas or dots. This mostly undesirable behavior ensures, however, in the present<br>
case that a binder with a fluorinated polymer, when used, in particular, as a<br>
corrosion-protective agent, provides improved contact of conductive particles, in<br>
particular of corrosion-protective particles, among each other, since the powderous<br>
polymer - unlike a liquid binder - does not spread on the metal surface to be coated<br>
or on the conductive particles. The contact between the conductive particles and the<br>
metal surface therefore remains excellent without the hitherto usual infiltration by the<br>
binder, so that a highly effective corrosion protection coating is formed. When used<br>
as a weldable corrosion-protective agent, the direct binding of the corrosion-<br>
protective particles ensures excellent conductivity.<br>
The fluorinated polymere is preferably used in powder form in the binder. It is<br>
therefore insoluble in the solvent of the binder. The powderous polymer melts at<br>
higher temperatures and hardens at a temperature above room temperature and<br>
below welding temperature. It thus forms point-shaped connections so to speak, so<br>
that the adhesion of the metal particles, essential for corrosion protection, is optimally<br>
maintained. It has been found to be particularly advantageous that the fluorinated<br>
polymer does not lose its binding capability even after repeated heating. While it may<br>
not be avoidable that parts of the fluorinated polymer are decomposed each time it is<br>
heated, the remaining portions still contribute to binding within the coating each time<br>
it is re-heated. The preferable particle diameter of the powdery fluorinated polymer<br>
depends on the desired film thickness of the coating made from the binder. It is<br>
preferably up to 20 pm, particularly preferably up to 10 pm, advantageously up to 5<br>
pm.<br><br>
-5-<br>
At least one fluorinated polymer Is necessary In the binder to achieve the effect<br>
according to the present Invention. Mixtures of fluorinated polymers may also be<br>
used. The following fluorinated polymers are particularly preferred, singly or In<br>
mixture: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvlnylldene fluoride (PVDF),<br>
tetrafluoroethylene / hexafluoropropylene-copolymer (FEP), perfluoroalcoxy-<br>
copolymer (PFA), copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with perfluorlnated propylene and<br>
perfluoroalcylvlnylether (EPE), copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and<br>
perfluoromethylvlnylether (MFA), copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with ethylene<br>
(ETFE), polychlorotrlfluoroethylene (PCTFE) and copolymer of ethylene, and<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the binder according to the present Invention provides<br>
that a fluorinated polymer Is used with a melting point between 100 °C and 500 °C,<br>
preferably between 150 °C and 350 °C. The choice of such a fluorinated polymer<br>
ensures that the fluorinated polymer has largely, or even completely, decomposed<br>
when the welding temperature Is reached.<br>
Since, according to a further preferred embodiment, the organofunctional silane has<br>
also substantially decomposed when the welding temperature is reached, the metal<br>
particles necessary for corrosion protection are in contact with each other largely<br>
unhindered by the binder when using the binder for weldable corrosion-protective<br>
agents so that an optimum corrosion protection is ensured.<br>
Depending on the use of the binder according to the present invention, the use of the<br>
fluorinated polymer can vary widely, from 0.1 weight% to 20 weight %, where 15<br>
weight % are preferred, particularly preferred up to 10 weight %, advantageously<br>
more than 5 weight %, particularly advantageously at least 2.5 weight %, each with<br>
respect to the binder.<br>
The fluorinated organic polymer is used with an average particle diameter of at least<br>
7.5 HE, preferably of 5 HE, particularly preferably of 6 HE to a maximum of 3 HE.<br>
Indication and measurement of the particle size is according to ASTM D 1210.<br>
The binder according to the present invention as defined in claim 1 or according to<br>
any one of the above described embodiments, can be selectively further developed<br><br>
-6-<br>
for special applications when co-binders are added. Co-binders can elastify tine<br>
binder, for example, if necessary. However, they can also improve adhesion of the<br>
binder or of the corrosion-protective agent made using the binder on the workpiece.<br>
Suitable co-binders are in particular, liquid organic binders. Co-binders are used<br>
preferably in an amount of 0.01 weight % up to 20 weight %. Acrylate resins,<br>
aldehyde resins, alcyd resins, epoxy resins, epoxy resin esters, cetone resins,<br>
maleate resins, melamine resins and phenol resins can be used, for example, singly<br>
or in a mixture.<br>
According to an advantageous further embodiment, the binder has additives, in<br>
particular additives for adjusting viscosity, rheology, wetting and dispersing<br>
charactehstics, deposition behavior, the adjustment of storage stability, sliding<br>
properties and processing characteristics. By adding the per se well known additives,<br>
the binder is adjusted to the requirements given by the application purpose or the<br>
processing properties. The viscosity and the rheological behavior of the binder are<br>
not only of importance, for example, when mixing with corrosion-protective particles<br>
or pigments, but also when the binder or a coating manufactured with the use of the<br>
binder is applied to the surface of workpieces. Wetting and dispersion properties and<br>
deposition behavior are usually adjusted to simplify the introduction and uniform<br>
suspension of particles, whether they are fluorinated polymers in the form of<br>
particles, or metal particles, salts or pigments. Additives for adjusting the sliding<br>
properties are aimed at adjusting the characteristics of the coatings obtained with the<br>
binder or used in coating agents manufactured with the binder. Additives, which<br>
adjust the storage characteristics, aim at preventing early reaction of the binding<br>
agent or the coating agents manufactured therewith.<br>
The use of the additives is preferably between 0.01 weight % and 20 weight %. The<br>
proper amount to be used is determined by means of simple optimizing tests.<br>
The binder according to the present invention advantageously has a baking<br>
temperature between 150 °C and 350 °C, preferably of 150 °C to 200 °C. The<br>
indication of the baking temperature refers to each object temperature required for<br>
baking the coated workpiece. The wide spectrum of the adjustable baking<br>
temperatures is advantageous, in particular, when workpieces of high-strength steels<br><br>
-7-<br>
are to be coated. Such materials should not be heated to elevated temperatures so<br>
as not to negatively affect the material strength. According to the present invention it<br>
is easily possible to adapt the binder and also the corrosion-protective agents made<br>
thereof to these requirements.<br>
The baking duration is preferably between 1 second and 90 minutes. It essentially<br>
depends on the baking temperature to be reached and on the way in which the<br>
baking temperature is generated. Inductive methods usually work with very short<br>
baking times, methods using convective heat transfer usually need longer baking<br>
times. A baking duration of between 30 seconds and 30 minutes is preferred,<br>
particularly preferred of between 1 minute and 20 minutes. The binder according to<br>
the present invention does not have to rely on the use of particular methods or<br>
installations for baking.<br>
The above described binder is suitable for use in corrosion-protective agents. For this<br>
purpose the binder has added to it corrosion-protective particles, in particular metal<br>
particles, preferably zinc or aluminum particles, or metal salts, or a mixture of<br>
different metal particles, or metal salts or a mixture of metal particles and metal salts.<br>
The advantageous effects of the titanium or zirconium compounds and the<br>
fluorinated polymer and the organofunctional silane preferably chosen as a function<br>
of the required product properties, when the binder is used in a corrosion-protective<br>
agent, have been explained in detail above. The components according to the<br>
present invention of the corrosion-protective agent are primarily the above-mentioned<br>
corrosion-protective particles, as well as the binder.<br>
The corrosion-protective agent according to the present invention preferably<br>
comprises at least 0.1 weight % up to 95 weight %, preferably up to 85 weight %,<br>
particularly preferably up to 70 weight %, advantageously up to 60 weight %,<br>
particularly advantageously up to 35 weight % corrosion-protective particles, each<br>
with respect to the corrosion-protective agent.<br>
The corrosion-protective agent according to the present invention, according to an<br>
advantageous embodiment, is adjusted such that the dry film thickness of the<br>
finished coating is 1 pm to 50 fjm, preferably up to 20 |jm, particularly preferably up<br><br>
-8-<br>
to 15 |jm, advantageously up to 5 |jm. The dry film thickness can be determined,<br>
mainly by the selection of metal and/or salt particles of a suitable size. The dry film<br>
thickness can also be adjusted by the respective aggregates with which the<br>
corrosion-protective agent is applied.<br>
It must be seen as a particular advantage of the corrosion-protective agent according<br>
to the present invention that it has excellent electric conductivity over and above the<br>
state of the art.<br>
If a weldable corrosion-protective agent is used according to the present invention, it<br>
is characterized, in particular, in that two workpieces, both coated on both sides, can<br>
be welded to each other. When two workpieces both coated on both sides are<br>
welded together, a total of four layers of weldable corrosion-protective agent must be<br>
overcome to achieve a strong weld connection. A technically realizable coating which<br>
reliably solves this problem is hitherto unknown. It has only been possible by using<br>
the weldable corrosion-protective agent according to the present invention. This is<br>
also due to the hardly diminished conductivity - unlike the prior art - between the<br>
welding electrodes that occurs when workpieces are welded together which are<br>
coated with the weldable corrosion-protective agent according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
A particular advantage of the weldable corrosion-protective agent according to the<br>
present invention must be seen in that reliable welds are created even in dot welding<br>
with processing times of about 80 ms, wherein neither evaporated metal nor binder<br>
residues, in particular of the monosilane, cause weak points in the weld.<br>
The binder according to the present invention and the coating agents made thereof,<br>
in particular corrosion-protective agents and/or weldable corrosion-protective agents,<br>
may be easily processed. They can be applied to the surface of workpieces using<br>
any known application method, such as doctored, sprayed, painted, dipped, rolled<br>
and the like.<br>
Details of the invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference<br>
to exemplary embodiments:<br><br>
-9-<br>
Binder I<br>

and II each relate to the binder.<br>
Manufacture of the binder I is explained in the following.<br>
Binder II with additives (prepared for improved mixing with corrosion-<br>
protective agent)<br>
Trimethoxyvinylsilane: 9.5 weight %,<br>
titanium-ethylhexanolate (tetra-2-ethylhexyl titanate): 24 weight %,<br>
n-butyl polytitanate (titanium tetrabutanolate, polymer): 35.5 weight %,<br>
alcohol: 14 weight %,<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride: 3.5 weight %, and<br>
antisettling agent: 11 weight % overall. Various antisettling agents are used, here: 2.5<br>
weight % amorphous silicic acid, 3 weight % paint additives Y 25 SN (Ashland) and<br>
5.5 weight % Ethocell 45 solution 11 % in alcohol of Ewald Dorken AG and<br>
wetting and dispersing additive: 2.5 weight % Disperbyk 160 solution 20 % in<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons (Ewald Dorken AG)<br>
sum: 100 weight % with respect to the binder.<br>
IVIanufacture of binder I and II<br>
These binder formulae I and II are each prepared in a coolable and heatable<br>
process container with integrated, infinitely variable stirring apparatus. The above<br>
mentioned components for binder I and binder II are consecutively mixed in the<br>
process container while stirring in the above mentioned sequence. The temperature<br><br>
- 10-<br>
is between -10 °C and +60 °C. The stirring apparatus is set to 1000 rpm and the<br>
binder is mixed for 5 minutes after adding each component.<br>
The binder has a baking temperature of 200 °C.<br>
A composition of corrosion-protective agents according to the present invention will<br>
be described in the following in an exemplary manner. The formula for a weldable<br>
corrosion-protective agent is also given:<br>
Corrosion-protective agent I<br>
43 weight % of binder II had added to it 55 weight % zinc paste (zinc paste: 90<br>
weight % zinc dust, stabilized with 10 weight % organic solvent) with an average<br>
diameter of the zinc particles of about 4 pm, and with 2 weight % aluminum paste.<br>
Zinc and aluminum particles are for cathodic corrosion protection. This formula of the<br>
corrosion-protective agent I is 100 weight %.<br>
Corrosion-protective agent II<br>
The corrosion-protective agent II described here is a weldable corrosion-protective<br>
agent. 45 weight % of binder II had added to it 25 weight % zinc paste (zinc paste:<br>
90 weight % zinc flake, stabilized with 10 weight % organic solvent) having an<br>
average diameter of the zinc particles of about 4 pm, and 25 weight % iron<br>
phosphide. The zinc particles and the iron phosphide were used as corrosion-<br>
protective particles. Then 5 weight % of an organic solvent are added to adjust<br>
viscosity. If no solvent is necessary, more binder, zinc paste and iron phosphide is<br>
added in a ratio of 2:1:1 to corrosion-protective agent II. The prescnbed composition<br>
of the weldable corrosion-protective agent is 100 weight %.<br>
To produce the weldable corrosion-protective agent, the binder is provided. Mixing in<br>
the corrosion-protective particles is carried out in the prescribed process container at<br>
1850 rpm for 15 minutes. The production of the weldable corrosion-protective agent<br>
is carried out in a temperature range from room temperature to not more than 40 °C.<br><br>
-11 -<br>
The weldable corrosion-protective agent is applied to the components of the B-pillar<br>
in an automotive vehicle body. The baking temperature, measured as the object<br>
temperature, is 200 °C; the baking duration in a continuous convection furnace is 30<br>
minutes. The dry film thickness of the corrosion protection coating is 10 +/- 3 pm.<br>
This coating withstands the salt spraying test according to DIN 50 021 for at least 48<br>
hours without red rust formation.<br>
Two components of the B-pillar having a material thickness of 2 mm and both coated<br>
in the above described manner with the corrosion-protective agent II are dot welded<br>
by means of electrodes. The thus dot welded components can be used for the<br>
construction of motor vehicles.<br><br>
