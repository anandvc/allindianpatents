Novel thrombin inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to novel five-membered heterocyclic amidines, to their preparation and to their use as competitive inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, especially thrombin and kininogenases such as kallikrein. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which contain the compounds as active ingredients, and to the use of the compounds as thrombin inhibitors, anticoagulants and antiinflammatory agents.<br>
Thrombin belongs to the group of serine proteases and plays a central part in the blood coagulation cascade as terminal enzyme. Both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation cascades lead via a plurality of amplifying stages to the production of throm¬bin from prothrombin. Thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin then initiates blood coagulation and aggregation of platelets which, in turn, due to the binding of platelet factor 3. and coagulation factor XIII, and a large number of highly active mediators, enhance thrombin formation.<br>
The formation and action of thrombin are central events in the development both of white, arterial and of red, venous thrombi and are therefore potentially effective points of attack for drugs. Thrombin inhibitors are, by contrast with heparin, able independently of cofactors completely to inhibit simultaneously the effects of free thrombin and of that bound to platelets. They are able to prevent in the acute phase thromboembolic events after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and lysis, and to act as anticoagulants in extracorporeal circulation (heart-lung machine, hemodialysis). They can also be used gener¬ally for the prophylaxis of thrombosis, for example after surgi¬cal operations.<br>
It is known that synthetic arginine derivatives influence the enzymatic activity of thrombin by interacting with the active serine residue of the protease thrombin. Peptides based on Phe-Pro-Arg in which the N-terminal amino acid is in the D form have proven particularly beneficial. D-Phe-Pro-Arg isopropyl ester is described as a competitive thrombin inhibitor (C.Mattson et al.. Folia Haematol, IQl (1983) 43-51).<br>
Derivatization of the arginine at the C terminus to the aldehyde leads to an enhancement of the inhibitory effect. Thus, a large number of arginals able to bind the hydroxyl group of the "active" serine in a hemiacetal have been described (EP 185390, 479489, 526877, 542525; WO 93/15756, 93/18060).<br><br>
The thrombin-inhibitory activity of peptide ketones, fluorinated alkyl ketones and of keto esters, boric acid derivatives, phos¬phoric esters and a-keto carboxamides can likewise be explained by this serine interaction (EP 118280, 195212, 362002, 364344, 410411, 471651, 589741, 293881, 503203, 504064, 530167; WO 92/07869, 94/08941).<br>
The diphenyl 4-amidinophenylglycinephosphonates described by J. Oleksyszyn et al. in J. Med. Chem. 37 (1994) 226-231 are irre¬versible thrombin inhibitors with inadequate selectivity in respect of other serine proteases.<br>
DE 3 108 810, WO 93/11152 and EP 601 459 describe agmatine and hence arginine derivatives which are unable to interact with the active serine in serine proteases.<br>
WO 94/29336, EP 0 601 459 and WO 95/23609 represent a further development in which the agmatine is replaced by an arylamidine residue.<br>
Kininogenases are serine proteases which liberate vasoactive pep¬tides, called kinins (bradykinin, kallidin and Met-Lys-bradyki-nin), from kininogens. Kininogens are multifunctional proteins which occur in coagulation and inflammation cascade reactions. As inhibitors, they protect cells from damage by cysteine proteases (Miiller Esterl, FEES Lett. 182 (1985) 310-314). Important kinino¬genases are plasma kallikrein, tissue kallikrein and mast cell tryptase.<br>
Kinins like bradykinin and kallidin are vasoactive peptides which influence a large number of biological processes. They play an essential part in inflammatory processes. By increasing vascular permeability, they lead to hypotension and edema. Furthermore, they are very potent pain-producing autacoids and have great im¬portance as cellular mediators in the pathophysiology of asthma, of allergic rhinitis and of arthritis (K.D. Bhoola, CD. Figueroa, K. Worthy, Pharmacological Reviews 44. (D (1992)1-80).<br>
Irrespective of the mechanisms underlying inflammatory processes, fluid containing all the protein systems in the circulating blood escapes from blood vessels. This means that escape of plasma fluid from vessels is involved in diseases such as asthma, rhini¬tis and inflammatory internal diseases. Moreover, mast cell tryp¬tase is released particularly in allergic processes (Salomons-son et al.. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 146 (1992) 1535-1542).<br>
The arginine chloromethyl ketones H-(D)-Pro-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl and<br><br>
H-(D) -Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2-Cl have been described by Kettner and Shaw as plasma kallikrein inhibitors (Biochem. H (1978) 4778-4784 and Meth. Enzym. M (1981) 826-842).<br>
Various synthetic derivatives of benzamidines and benzylamines have proven to be inhibitors of plasma kallikrein, with the benzamidines having a considerably stronger inhibitory effect (F. Markward, S. Drawert, P. Walsmann, Biochemical Pharmacology 21 (1974) 2247-2256) .<br>
PKSI-527, the hydrochloride of N-(trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexyl-carbonyl)-L-phenylalanine 4-carboxymethylanilide, is also an effective inhibitor of this kininogenase (Wanaka, Ohamoto et al., Thromb. Res., 51 (6) (1990) 889-895).<br>

D have the abovementioned meanings, and there is on the nitrogen atom of E a hydrogen atom, a protective group, an unsubstituted or substituted natural or unnatural amino acid, an unsubstituted or substituted carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid or an unsubsti¬tuted or substituted alkyl radical. The structural fragment is valuable as constituent of serine protease inhibitors and espe¬cially of thrombin and kallikrein inhibitors.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the intermediates of the formula Ila and lib<br><br><br>
The novel intermediates are used to prepare the compounds I and are valuable building blocks for synthesizing serine protease inhibitors.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can exist as such or in the form of their salts with physiologically tolerated acids. Examples of such acids are: hydrochloric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, hydroxy-succinic acid, sulfuric acid, glutaric acid, aspartic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoic acid, glucuronic acid, oxalic acid, ascor¬bic acid and acetylgylcine.<br>
The novel compounds of the formula I can be employed for the fol¬lowing indications:<br>
diseases whose pathogenetic mechanism derives directly or indirectly from the proteolytic effect of thrombin,<br>
diseases whose pathogenetic mechanism derives from thrombin-dependent activation of receptors and signal transductions,<br>
diseases associated with stimulation [eg. by PAI-1, PDGF (platelet derived growth factor), P-selectin, ICAM-1, tissue factor] or inhibition (eg. NO synthesis in smooth muscle cells) of the expression of genes in body cells,<br>
diseases deriving from the mitogenic effect of thrombin,<br>
diseases deriving from a thrombin-dependent change in the contractility and permeability of epithelial cells (eg. vascular endothelial cells),<br>
thrombin-dependent thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial or cerebral infarct, atrial fibrillation, bypass occlusion,<br>
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIG),<br>
reocclusion and for reducing the reperfusion time on comedication with thrombolytics such as streptokinase, urokinase, prourokinase, t-PA, APSAC, plasminogen activators from the salivary glands of animals, and the recombinant and mutated forms of all these substances,<br>
the occurrence of early reocclusion and late restenosis after<br><br>
PTCA,<br>
the thrombin-dependent proliferation of smooth muscle cells,<br>
the accumulation of active thrombin in the CNS (eg. in Alzheimer's disease),<br>
tumor growth and to prevent adhesion and metastasis of tumor cells.<br>
The novel compounds can be used in particular for the therapy and prophylaxis of thrombin-dependent thromboembolic events such as deep vein thromboses, pulmonary embolisms, myocardial or cerebral infarcts and unstable angina, also for the therapy of dissemi¬nated intravascular coagulation (DIG). They are furthermore suit¬able for combination therapy with thrombolytics such as strepto¬kinase, urokinase, prourokinase, t-PA, APSAC and other plasmino¬gen activators to shorten the reperfusion time and extend the reocclusion time.<br>
Further preferred areas of use are to prevent thrombin-dependent early reocclusion and late restenosis after percutaneous trans¬luminal coronary angioplasty, to prevent thrombin-induced pro¬liferation of smooth muscle cells, to prevent accumulation of active thrombin in the CNS (eg. in Alzheimer's disease), to con¬trol tumors and to prevent mechanisms which lead to adhesion and metastasis of tumor cells.<br>
The novel compounds can also be used for coating artificial sur¬faces such as hemodialysis membranes and the tubing systems and lines necessary therefor, and of oxygenators in extravascular circulation, stents and heart valves.<br>
The novel compounds can furthermore be employed for diseases whose pathogenetic mechanism derives directly or indirectly from the proteolytic effect of kininogenases, especially kallikrein, eg. in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, pancreatitis, rhinitis, arthritis, urticaria and other internal inflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be administered in a conventional way orally or parenterally (subcutaneously, intrave¬nously, intramuscularly, interperitoneally, rectally). Adminis¬tration can also take place with vapors or sprays through the nasopharyngeal space.<br>
The dosage depends on the age, condition and weight of the<br><br>
patient -and on the mode of administration. As a rule, the daily dose of active substance per person is about 10-2000 mg on oral administration and about 1-200 mg on parenteral administration. This dose can be given in 2 to 4 single doses or once a day as depot form.<br>
The novel compounds can be used in conventional solid or liquid pharmaceutical forms, eg. as uncoated or (film-)coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suppositories, solutions, ointments, creams or sprays. These are produced in a conventional manner. The active substances can for this purpose be mixed with conven¬tional pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as tablet binders, bulking agents, preservatives, tablet disintegrants, flow regulators, plasticizers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solvents, release-slowing agents, antioxidants and/or propellant gases (cf. H. Sucker et al.: Pharmazeutische Technologie, Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978) . The administration forms obtained in this way normally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight of active substance.<br>
Experimental part<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be prepared as shown in Schemes I-III.<br>
Building blocks A, B, E and D are preferably assembled separately beforehand and employed in suitably protected form (see Schemes I-III).<br><br><br>
(P = protective group, (P) = protective group or H)<br>
Scheme I describes linear assemblage of the molecule I by cou¬pling the amine H-D-CN to the N-protected amino acid P-E-OH to give P-E-D-CN, eliminating the N-terminal protective group to give H-E-D-CN, coupling to the N-protected amino acid P-B-OH to give P-B-E-D-CN, eliminating the protective group P to give H-B-E-D-CN, subsequently alkylating with the unprotected or protected (P)-A-U building block (U = leaving group) or reductively alky¬lating with (P)-A'-U (U = aldehyde, ketone) or Michael addition with a suitable (P)-A"-C=C- derivative to give (P)-A-B-E-D-CN. Conversion of the nitrile functionality into the amidine group takes place either by the classical Pinner synthesis (R. Boder, D.G. Neilson, Chem. Rev.  (1962) 179) or by a modified Pinner synthesis which proceeds via imino thioester salts as intermedi¬ate (H. Vieweg et al. , Pharmazie 39. (1984) 226) or directly by the method of A. Eschenmoser Helv. Chimica Acta 69. (1986) 1224. Subsequently the protective groups still present in the molecule are eliminated, preferably by acid hydrolysis.<br>
If building block D is incorporated as H-D-CONH2 into the synthe¬sis, dehydration of the amide to the nitrile functionality, or the conversion into the thioamide functionalities takes place on<br><br>
one of the protected intermediates. As an alternative, the build¬ing block D may be employed as H-D-CSNH2 in the synthesis.<br>
Scheme II<br><br>
Scheme II describes linear assemblage of the molecule I by alkylation, reductive amination or Michael addition of H-B-P onto appropriately suitable unprotected or protected A building blocks to give (P)-A-B-P, elimination of the C-terminal protective group to give (P)-A-B-OH, coupling to H-E-P to give (P)-A-B-E-P, elimi-. nation of the C-terminal protective group to give (P)-A-B-E-OH, coupling to H-D-CN to give (P)-A-E-C-D-CN and reaction of this intermediate to give the final product as in Scheme I.<br>
Where compounds (P)-A-B-P still have a free NH functionality on B, this must be provided with a suitable protective group before elimination of the C-terminal protective group. The protective groups used in each case must be orthogonal to one another.<br>
As an alternative to the H-D-CN building block, it is also pos¬sible to employ H-D-CONH2, H-D-CSNH2, H-D-C(NH)NH2, H-D-C(NP)NH2, H-D-C (NP)NHP, with the coupled intermediate (P)-A-B-E-D-CONH2 in the first case being dehydrated to (P)-A-B-E-D-CN or being di-<br><br>
rectly converted into (P)-A-B-E-D-CSNHj. Scheme III<br><br>
Scheme III describes a very efficient way for preparing compounds I by a convergent synthesis. The appropriately protected building blocks (P)-A-B-OH and H-E-D-CN are coupled together and the resulting intermediate (P)-A-B-E-D-CN is reacted to give the final product as in Scheme I.<br>
As an alternative to H-E-D-CN, it is also possible to employ H-E-D-CONH2 or H-E-D-CSNH2, and in the first case the coupled in¬termediate (P)-A-B-E-D-CONH2 is dehydrated to (P)-A-B-E-D-CN or converted into (P)-A-B-E-D-CSNH2.<br>
The N-terminal protective groups employed are Boc, Cbz or Fmoc, preferably Boc, and the C-terminal protective groups are methyl, tert-butyl and benzyl. If a plurality of protective groups is present in the molecule, they must be orthogonal to one another if they are not to be eliminated simultaneously. If the inter¬mediates contain building block E, the Cbz and benzyl protective groups are unsuitable.<br>
The required coupling reactions and the other reactions for introducing and eliminating protective groups are carried out under standard conditions of peptide chemistry (see M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky "The Practice of Peptide Synthesis", 2nd edition. Springer Verlag Heidelberg, 1994).<br>
Boc protective groups are eliminated using dioxane/HCl or TFA/ DCM, and Cbz protective groups are eliminated by hydrogenolysis<br><br>
or with HF. Hydrolysis of ester functionalities takes place with LiOH in an alcoholic solvent or in dioxane/water. TFA or dioxane/ HCl is used to cleave t-butyl esters.<br>
The reactions were checked by TLC, normally using the following mobile phases:<br>
A.	DCM/MeOH	95:5<br>
B.	DCM/MeOH	9 :1<br>
C.	DCM/MeOH	8:2<br>
D.	DCM/MeOH/50 % HOAc	40:10:5<br>
E.	DCM/MeOH/50 % HOAc	35:15:5<br>
Where separations by column chromatography are mentioned, these were separations on silica gel using the abovementioned mobile phases.<br>
Reversed phase HPLC separations were carried out with aceto-nitrile/water and HOAc buffer.<br>
The starting compounds can be prepared by the following methods:<br>
Examples of building blocks A employed for the alkylation are tert-butyl a-bromoacetate, tert-butyl p-bromopropionate, tert-butyl a-bromopropionate, tert-butyl ytioitobutyrate, tert-butyl a-bromobutyrate, THP-protected bromoethanol, THP-protected y-bro-mopropanol, a-bromo-y-butyrolactone, for the reductive amination are dihydroxyacetone, di-tert-butyl acetonedicarboxylate, and for the Michael addition are tert-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl meth-acrylate, di-tert-butyl fumarate. Those of said tert-butyl esters which cannot be purchased are prepared by methods similar to G. Uray, W. Lindner, Tetrahedron, 44. 1988 4357-4362.<br>
B building blocks:<br>
A wide variety of possibilities is available in the literature for the general and specific synthesis of amino acids. A review thereof is provided by, inter alia, Houben-Weyl, Volume E16d/Part 1, pages 406 et seq.<br>
Precursors which were frequently employed were diphenylmethylene-glycine ethyl ester, diethyl acetamidomalonate and ethyl isocya-noacetate.<br>
Various glycine and alanine derivatives were prepared, for exam¬ple, starting from ethyl isocyanoacetate and an appropriate ke¬tone or aldehyde (see H.- J. Pratorius, J. Flossdorf, M.-R. Kula<br><br>
Chem. Ber. IM (1975) 3079) .<br>
The syntheses of cyclooctylglycine, 2-norbornylglycine, adamantylalanine, ymethylcyclohexylalanine, 4-isopropyl-1-cyclo-hexylalanine, 4-methyl-1-cyclohexylalanine and 4-methyl-1-cycIo-hexylglycine were carried out via the corresponding ethyl 2-formylaminoacrylates (U. Schollkopf and R. Meyer, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1977, 1174) starting from ethyl isocyanoacetate with the relevant carbonyl compounds cyclooctanone, 2-norbornanone, 1-formyladamantane, 1-formyl-1-methylcyclohexane, 1-formyl-4 -iso-propylcyclohexane, 1-formyl-4-methylcyclohexane and 4-methyl-cyclohexanone by the following general methods:<br>
General method for synthesizing ethyl 2-formylaminoacrylates<br>
A solution of 100 mmol of ethyl isocyanoacetate in 50 ml of THF was added dropwise to 100 mmol of potassium tert-butoxide in 150 ml of THF at 0 to -10°C. After 15 min at the same temperature 100 mmol of the appropriate carbonyl compound in 50 ml of THF were added, the reaction mixture was allowed slowly to rise to RT, and the solvent was stripped off in a rotary evaporator. The residue was mixed with 50 ml of water, 100 ml of acetic acid and 100 ml of DCM, and the product was extracted with DCM. The DCM phase was dried over Na2S04, and the solvent was stripped off in a rotary evaporator. The products resulted almost pure but could, if necessary, be purified further by column chromatography on silica gel (mobile phases: ether/petroleum ether mixtures).<br>
General method for amino acid hydrochlorides starting from the ethyl 2-formylaminoacrylates<br>
100 mmol of the ethyl 2-formylaminoacrylates were hydrogenated with Pd/C (10%) and hydrogen in 200 ml of glacial acetic acid until the reaction was complete. The catalyst was then filtered off, the acetic acid was stripped off as far as possible in a rotary evaporator, and the residue was refluxed in 200 ml of 50% concentrated hydrochloric acid for 5 h. The hydrochloric acid was stripped off in a rotary evaporator, and the product was dried at 50OC under reduced pressure and then washed several times with ether. The hydrochlorides resulted as pale colored crystals.<br>
25.0 g of cyclooctylglycine hydrochloride were obtained starting from 18.9 g (150 mmol) of cyclooctanone. 26.6 g of 2-norbornyl¬glycine hydrochloride were obtained starting from 16.5 g (150 mmol) of 2-norbornanone. 26.0 g of adamantylalanine hydrochloride were obtained starting from 19.7 g (120 mmol) of 1-formyladaman¬tane. 16.6 g of y-methylcyclohexylalanine hydrochloride were<br><br>
obtained starting from 12.6 g (luu mmoi) ot l-tormyi-l-methyl-cyclohexane. 25.9 g of 4-methylcyclohexylglycine hydrochloride were obtained starting from 16.8 g (150 mmol) of 4-methylcycle-hexanone. 18 g of trans-4-methyl-l-cyclohexylalanine hydrochlo¬ride were obtained starting from 15 g of trans-1-formyl-4-methyl-cyclohexane. 10 g of 3,3-dimethyl-l-cyclohexylalanine hydro¬chloride were obtained starting from 9 g of 3,3-dimethyl-l-formylcyclohexane.<br>
The aldehyde l-formyl-3,3-dimethylcyclohexane required for the synthesis is prepared by a method based on those of Moskal and Lensen (Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 106 (1987) 137-141).<br>
A solution of n-butyllithium in n-hexane (72 ml, 115 mmol) was added dropwise over the course of 10 min to a stirred solution of diethyl isocyanomethylphosphonate (17 ml, 105 mmol) in 280 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether at -60°C. The resulting suspension was then stirred at -60°C for 15 min and, over the course of 10 min, a solution of 3,3-dimethylcyclohexanone (13 g, 105 mmol) in 100 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether was added, keeping the temperature below -45°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to reach 0°C and, after stirring at this temperature for 90 min, 150-200 ml of 38% strength aqueous hydrochloric acid were cautiously added. The mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 15 h to complete the hydrolysis. The organic phase was separated off and washed with 200 ml each of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. It was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in a rotary evaporator in order to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was employed without further purification as starting material for synthesizing the amino acid.<br>
Boc-(D)-a-methylcyclohexylalanine<br>
3.4 g (12.2 mmol) of Boc-(D)-a-methyl-Phe-OH were hydrogenated in<br>
100 ml of MeOH in the presence of 250 mg of 5% Rh on AI2O3 under<br>
10 bar of hydrogen at 50°C for 24 h. Filtration and stripping off<br>
the solvent resulted in 2.8 g of Boc-(D)-a-methyl-Cha-OH.<br>
H-NMR (DMS0-d6, 8 in ppm): 12 (very broad signal, COOH); 1.7-0.8<br>
(25 H; 1.35 (s, Boc), 1.30 (s. Me))<br>
Boc-(3-Ph)-Pro-OH was synthesized by a method similar to that of J.Y.L. Chung et al. (J.Y.L. Chung et al. J.Org.Chem. 55.   (1990) 270) .<br>
Preparation of Boc-1-tetralinylglycine<br>
Boc-1-Tetralinylglycine was prepared starting from 1,2-dihydro-<br><br>
naphthalene. 1,2-dihydronaphthalene was initially converted into 1-tetralyl bromide with HBr (similar to J. Med. Chem. 17 (1994) 1586). The bromide was subsequently reacted with diethyl acetamidomalonate and, after hydrolytic cleavage, the resulting a-amino acid was converted into the Boc-protected form under standard conditions. Another possible preparation is described by E. Reimann and D. Voss (E. Reimann, D. Voss, Arch. Pharm. 310 (1977) 102) .<br>
Preparation of Boc-1 -(D,L)Tic-OH<br>
Boc-1-(D,L)Tic-OH was prepared by a method of R. T. Shuman et al. (R.T. Shuman et al. J. Med, Chem. 16. (1993) 314),<br>
Preparation of Boc-(D,L)Dch-OH<br>
Boc-(D,L)-Dpa-OH (1 mmol) was hydrogenated in 12 ml of MeOH together with catalytic amounts of 5% Rh/Al203 under 5 bar. Filtration and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure resulted in the product in quantitative yield.<br>
Preparation of cycloheptylglycine, cyclopentylglycine, 4-isopro-pylcyclohexylglycine and 3,3-dimethyl-cyclohexylglycine<br>
These amino acids were prepared by reacting cycloheptanone, cyclopentanone, 4-isopropylcyclohexanone and 3 , 3-dimethylcyclo-hexanone, respectively, with ethyl isocyanoacetate by a method of H.J. Pratorius (H.J. Pratorius, J. Flossdorf, M.Kula, Chem. Ber. 108 (1985) 3079) .<br>
Preparation of H-D,L-Chea-OH<br>
4.0 g of cycloheptylmethyl methanesulfonate (19.39 mmol), pre¬pared from cycloheptylmethanol and methanesulfonyl chloride, were refluxed together with 4.9 g of diphenylmethyleneglycine ethyl ester (18.47 mmol), 8.9 g of dry, finely powdered potassium car¬bonate (64.65 mmol) and 1 g of tetrabutylammonium bromide (3 mmol) in 50 ml of dry acetonitrile under an inert gas atmo¬sphere for 10 h. The potassium carbonate was then filtered off, the filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and the crude product was hydrolyzed directly with 20 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid in 40 ml of ethanol, stirring at RT for 1.5 h. The reaction solution was diluted and then benzophenone was extracted with ethyl acetate in the acidic range, and subsequently H-D,L-Chea-OEt was extracted with DCM in the alkaline range (pH = 9), and the solution was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in a rotary evapo¬rator. Yield 3.7 g = 95% of theory.<br><br>
Boc-(D,L)- (3,4,5-(MeO)3)Phe-OH was prepared by alkylation of diphenolmethyleneglycine ethyl ester with trimethoxybenzyl chlo¬ride, subsequent introduction of the Boc protective group and ester hydrolysis.<br>
D-(1,4-Cyclohexadienyl)Ala-OH was prepared by the method of G. Zivilichovsky, V. Gurvich J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans I 1£ (1995) 2509-15.<br>
H-(D,L)-pp-Me2Cha-0H was prepared by the method of U. Schollkopf, R. Meyer, L. Ann. Chem. (1977) 1174-82.<br>
Said amino acids were converted with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in water/dloxane by conventional methods into the Boc-protected form in each case and subsequently recrystallized from ethyl acetate/ hexane mixtures or purified by column chromatography on silica gel (mobile phases: ethyl acetate/petroleum ether mixtures).<br>
The Boc-protected amino acids were employed as B building blocks as shown in Scheme I.<br>
Said amino acids as B building blocks were also in some cases converted into the corresponding benzyl esters and linked to the appropriately protected A building blocks. In the case of com¬pounds with an N-H functionality which was still free, this was subsequently protected with a Boc group, the benzyl ester group was removed by hydrogenation, and the building block A-B-OH was purified by crystallization, salt precipitation or column chroma¬tography. This route is described by way of example for tBuOOC-CH2-(Boc)(D)Cha-OH below.<br>
Synthesis of D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl ester<br>
A suspension of 100 g (481 ramol) of D-cyclohexylalanine hydro¬chloride, 104 g (962 mmol) of benzyl alcohol and 109.7 g (577 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in 2200 ml of toluene was slowly heated to reflux with a water separator. Evolution of hydrogen chloride and dissolving of the suspension to give a clear solution were observed in the temperature range 80-90°C. When no further water separated out (about 4 h), 500 ml of toluene were distilled out, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool overnight, and the resulting residue was filtered off and washed twice with 1000 ml of hexane each time. The resulting res¬idue (195 g) was then suspended in 2000 ml of dichloromethane and, after addition of 1000 ml of water, adjusted to pH 9-9.5 by gradual addition of 50% strength sodium hydroxide solution while<br><br>
stirring. The organic phase was separated off, washed twice with 500 ml of water each time, dried over sodium sulfate and filtered to remove desiccant, and concentration of the filtrate resulted in 115 g (94%) of the title product as pale oil.<br>
N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylmethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl ester<br>
115 g (440 mmol) of D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl ester were dis¬solved in 2000 ml of acetonitrile and, at room temperature, 607.5 g (4.40 mol) of potassium carbonate and 94.3 g (484 mmol) of tert-butyl bromoacetate were added, and the mixture was stirred at this temperature for 3 days. Carbonate was filtered off, washing with acetonitrile, the mother liquor was concen¬trated (30°C, 20 mbar), the residue was taken up in 1000 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether, and the organic phase was extracted with 5% strength citric acid and saturated sodium bicarbonate solu¬tion. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered to remove desiccant and concentrated, and the resulting oil (168 g) was employed directly in the next reaction.<br>
N-Boc-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylmethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl ester<br>
The oil (168 g, 447 mmol) obtained in the previous synthesis was dissolved in 1400 ml of acetonitrile and, after addition of 618 g (4.47 mmol) of potassium carbonate powder and 107.3 g (492 mmol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, stirred at room temperature for 6 days. The potassium carbonate was filtered off with suction, washing with about 1000 ml of acetonitrile, and the filtrate was concentrated. 230 g of the required product were obtained.<br>
N-Boc-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylmethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine cyclo-hexylammonium salt<br>
115 g of N-Boc-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylmethyl)-D-cyclohexylala¬nine benzyl ester were dissolved in 1000 ml of pure ethanol and hydrogenated in the presence of 9 g of 10% Pd on active carbon with hydrogen under atmospheric pressure at 25-30°C for 2 h. Filtration and removal of the solvent in a rotary evaporator resulted in 100 g (260 mmol) of a yellow oil which was taken up in 1600 ml of acetone and heated to reflux. The heating bath was removed, and a solution of 27 g (273 mmol) of cyclohexylamine in acetone was quickly added through a dropping funnel. The required salt crystallized out on cooling the reaction mixture to room i temperature. The solid was filtered off, washed with 200 ml of acetone and, for final purification, recrystallized once more from acetone. Drying of the residue in a vacuum oven at about 30°C<br><br>
resulted in 70.2 g of the required salt as white powder.<br>
N-Boc-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylmethyl)-D-cyclohexylglycine cyclo-hexylammonium salt was prepared in a similar way from cyclohex-ylglycine as precursor.<br>
N-Boc-N-(tert-butyloxycarbonylethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine cyclo-hexylammonium salt<br>
a)	tert-Butyl 3-bromopropionate<br>
16.64 g (109 mmol) of bromopropionic acid, 150 ml of condensed 2-methylpropene and 2 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were placed at -3 0°C under a countercurrent of nitrogen in a glass vessel suitable for an autoclave, tightly closed and stirred at room temperature for 72 h. For workup, the reaction vessel was again cooled to -30°C, and the solution was cautiously poured into 200 ml of ice-cold saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. Excess 2-methylpropene was allowed to evaporate off with stirring, the residue was extracted three times with 50 ml of dichloromethane each time, the combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, the desiccant was filtered off, and the solution was concentrated under water pump vacuum. The oily residue was purified by column chromatography (mobile phase n-hexane, later n-hexane/diethyl ether 9:1). 18.86 g of the title compound were obtained.<br>
b)	N-(tert-Butyloxycarbonylethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl<br>
ester<br>
49.4 g (189 mmol) of D-cyclohexylalanine benzyl ester were dissolved in 250 ml of acetonitrile and, after addition of 31.6 g (151 mmol) of tert-butyl bromopropionate at room temperature, refluxed for 5 days. The resulting precipitate was filtered off and washed several times with acetonitrile, the filtrate was concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue was taken up in 350 ml of dichloromethane, and the organic phase was extracted with 5% strength citric acid and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered to remove desiccant and concentrated. The oily residue was purified by column chromatography (mobile phase dichloromethane, later dichloromethane/methanol 95:5). A slightly impure oil was obtained and was employed directly in the next reaction.<br><br>
c)	N-BOc-N-(tert-Butyloxycarbonylethyl)-D-cyclohexylalanine<br>
benzyl ester<br>
The oil obtained in the previous synthesis (30 g, max. 70 mmol) was dissolved in 150 ml acetonitrile and, after addition of 28 ml (160 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine and 19.2 g (88 mmol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The reaction mixture was concentrated in a rotary evaporator under water pump vacuum, the residue was taken up in n-hexane and washed five times with 3 ml of a 5% strength citric acid solution each time, the combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, the desiccant was filtered off, and the residue after concentration was subjected to separation by column chromatography (mobile phase hexane/ethyl acetate 95:5). 32.66 g (64 mmol) of the required product were obtained.<br>
