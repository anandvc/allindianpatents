FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to internal combustion engine and more particularly it relates to the drive arrangement for reciprocating systems using engine rocker arm system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In vehicles with Internal Combustion Engine ("IC engine") the fuel is supplied from fuel tank to the engine. The fuel needs to be supplied within certain pressure range. This necessitates use of fuel feed pump. The mechanical fuel feed pump requires a reciprocating input for its actuation. The conventional input is from engine camshaft adapted to have extra cam lobe and with crankcase mounted on feed pump. In some vehicles this is very difficult due to packaging complexity arising of the accessories present in the engine family. It also requires machining changes in the cylinder block transfer line, which calls for heavy investments. This necessitated need for alternate innovative way for providing the input to fuel feed pump.<br>

IC engine with novel drive arrangement for reciprocating devices in accordance with this invention basically comprises of crankcase, cylinder head, piston, connecting rod, crankshaft, gear train, valve train, rocker cover and one or more reciprocating devices, wherein said reciprocating device is mounted on the rocker cover by means of fasteners. Drive unit for said reciprocating device/s is connected to the rocker arm assembly through rocker arm adjusting screw or it can be directly<br><br>
fitted to rocker arm assembly. Said drive unit provides the drive input to the reciprocating device/s. In the valve train system, the cam lobes are designed suitably to provide the required lift for the engine valves. As drive unit is attached to the rocker arm assembly, certain lift for drive unit is achieved during normal engine operation. The drive unit can alternatively be positioned at different locations on the rocker arm assembly, from valve end to adjusting nut end or extending on either side based on lift requirement of reciprocating device.<br>
Thus necessary lift for the drive unit on the engine rocker is achieved from the cam lobes of the engine camshaft, through the tappet and pushrod system of the engine.<br>
The lubrication for the drive interface is achieved by means of oil mist which is present inside rocker cover, thus ensuring adequate reliability and durability of the drive system.<br>
DEATIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Fig. 1 shows the cross sectional view of IC engine with novel drive arrangement for<br>
reciprocating devices<br>
Fig. 2 shows valve train system of IC engine<br>
Fig. 3 shows rocker arm assembly<br>
Fig. 4 shows the detail of novel drive arrangement<br>
Fig. 5 shows the external view of mounting arrangement of reciprocating device on<br>
rocker cover<br>
Referring to figs. 1 to 5<br><br>
IC engine with novel drive arrangement for reciprocating devices basically comprises of crankcase (1), cylinder head (2), piston (3), piston pin (4), connecting rod (5), crankshaft (6), valve train (7), rocker cover (8) and one or more reciprocating device /s (9). Wherein said Valve train (7) further comprises of intake / exhaust valve (10), rocker arm (11) which pivots over the rocker arm shaft (12). The rocker arm shaft is supported by pedestal rocker arm (13). At other end of the rocker arm is the adjusting screw (14) which has adjustable position in the rocker. The adjusting screw is locked in position by the lock nut (15). The rocker arm assembly (16) consists of rocker arm (11), adjusting screw (14) &amp; lock nut (15). Drive unit (17) for said reciprocating device/s (9) is connected to the rocker arm assembly (16) by internal threads engaging in adjusting screw (14) or it is directly fitted to rocker arm assembly (16) by alternate means (press fit, bolting etc).<br>
The location of drive unit (17) depends upon the lift requirement of the reciprocating device (9). This can be either at the adjusting screw (14) location or suitably be varied on the rocker arm (11) to achieve the desired lift of the drive unit (17) for the cam lift from the engine cam shaft. The push rod (18) is the connecting link between the rocker / adjusting screw (14) and the valve tappet (19). The valve tappet (19) is guided in the crankcase (1) and runs on the lobes of engine cam shaft (20). The cam shaft (20) is supported in the crankcase (1) and takes drive input from the crankshaft through gear train or belt drive. The reciprocating device (9) is mounted on the rocker cover (8).<br>
Said reciprocating device (9) can be either mechanical fuel feed pump, pneumatic pump, diaphragm pump etc. which works on reciprocating drive input principle.<br>
This invention also applies for the engines with overhead camshaft, wherein the cam motion is transferred via rockers to the engine valves. The components illustrated herein are typical for the system under consideration for demonstrative purpose. But the invention covers the arrangement wherein the physical shape of<br><br>
the components may change or the components may be clubbed together serving the same end result.<br>
During engine operation cam lobe actuates the valve tappet (19) which in turn actuates the push rod (18), pushrod (18) actuates the rocker arm (11), due to this rocker arm (11) oscillates pivoting about the rocker shaft (12). This motion actuates the opening and closing of the engine valve (10).<br>
The drive unit (17) fitted on rocker arm (11) gets lifted up during the opening of the engine valve (10). This rising motion of the drive unit (17) results in lifting of driven unit (21) of the reciprocating device/s (9) is a plunger with ball arrangement wherein the ball is rotatably mounted to the plunger to transmit the motion from rocker arm to the plunger i.e. to convert oscillatory motion of said rocker arm to reciprocatory motion.<br>
After the cam lobe peak is reached, further rotation of camshaft guides engine valve (10) return motion due to cam profile and the force exerted by valve springs acting on the engine valve (10), leading to the closing of the engine valve (10) and in turn the rocker arm (11), push rod (18) and valve tappet (19) motion is reversed with respect to initial motion.<br>
This rocker arm (11) motion leads to the lowering of the drive unit (17). The spring in the reciprocating device (9) forces the driven unit (21) which is a plunger with ball arrangement to be lowered guided by the motion of the drive unit (17). This completes one rising stroke and return stroke of the driven unit (21) of the reciprocating device (9).<br>
This reciprocating motion of driven unit (21) is repeated for every rotation of the camshaft. Thus the reciprocating drive is provided to the reciprocating device during the opening and closing of engine valve.<br><br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br>
