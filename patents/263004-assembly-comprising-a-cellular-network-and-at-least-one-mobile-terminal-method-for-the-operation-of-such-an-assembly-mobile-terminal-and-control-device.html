				<td>Description<br>
Assembly comprising a cellular network and at least one mobile<br>
terminal, method for the operation of such an assembly, mobile<br>
terminal and control device<br>
The invention relates to an assembly comprising a cellular<br>
network which has a mobile core network and a number of access<br>
networks for connecting mobile terminals to the mobile core<br>
network, and comprising at least one mobile terminal.<br>
US 2005/227692 Al relates to a network selection method,<br>
wherein a mobile terminal, during a conversation with a<br>
subscriber, selects a network from a multiplicity of networks<br>
if the connection deteriorates or a further network is<br>
detected. The continuance of the connection between the parties<br>
is ensured by selecting a network under supervision of the<br>
server system.<br>
In the context of cellular networks of the so-called third<br>
generation, it is usual that, for connecting mobile terminals,<br>
a cellular network has a number of access networks which are<br>
connected to a so-called mobile core network of the cellular<br>
network. The terms of the access network and the mobile core<br>
network are generally known to the expert in the field of<br>
mobile radio. Thus, the mobile core network, in particular,<br>
contains switching- and network-oriented functions and devices<br>
such as, for example, switching centers and home data bases. In<br>
comparison, access networks, in particular, comprise the<br>
radio-related part of a cellular network, i.e., in particular,<br>
this is the base station system. A mobile terminal can be, for<br>
example, a mobile radio<br><br>
telephone, a mobile computer ("notebook"), a so-called PDA<br>
(personal digital assistant) with a radio interface or also a<br>
radio module. Radio modules are used for establishing a<br>
communication link via a communication network in the form of a<br>
cellular network in the most varied areas such as, for example,<br>
for applications in the so-called machine-to-machine (M2M)<br>
field or for supporting applications in the field of<br>
telematics.<br><br>
An access network can be, for example, such a one in accordance<br>
with the GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) or the UMTS<br>
(Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) standard. Various<br>
access networks usually overlap wholly or partially with<br>
respect to their geographic coverage, i.e. at a particular<br>
geographic location, a number of access networks are frequently<br>
available to a mobile terminal for utilizing mobile radio<br>
services. These can be different access networks of a network<br>
operator (which, in the context of the present invention,<br>
together with a mobile core network connected to them are<br>
called cellular network) or also access networks of different<br>
network operators.<br>
The average number of access networks available at a geographic<br>
location will increase further due to future generations of<br>
radio standards (i.e. particularly those beyond the third<br>
mobile radio generation) which lead to the provision of<br>
evermore powerful access networks. In such an environment, it<br>
is of high significance how one of the available access<br>
networks is selected for a mobile terminal. Such a selection is<br>
required both when the mobile terminal registers in the<br>
cellular network for the first time via one of the access<br>
networks after the mobile terminal is switched on and at later<br>
times under certain circumstances such as, for example, in the<br>
case of a deterioration of the transmission quality of the<br>
access network currently used. A change of the mobile terminal<br>
from one access network to another one is generally also called<br>
a "handover". In this context, it is also necessary, apart from<br>
selecting the access network to be used, to establish the<br>
protocol or protocol layer, respectively, with which the<br>
handover is to take place.<br><br>
The selection of one of the available access networks usually<br>
occurs by taking into consideration certain aspects or<br>
criteria. In general, it is thus worthwhile for a mobile<br>
terminal or its user, respectively, to use at any time the best<br>
possible connection under the respective circumstances, i.e.<br>
select the access network by significantly taking into<br>
consideration the quality of the connection. Apart from the<br>
transmission quality, a multiplicity of other criteria can have<br>
an influence on which one represents the preferred access<br>
network from the point of view of the mobile terminal (or its<br>
user, respectively). Examples of this are the costs for a call<br>
or a data transmission, general preferences of the user or<br>
characteristics of the mobile terminal.<br>
In contrast, a selection of the access network to be used by a<br>
mobile terminal in accordance with other criteria such as, for<br>
example, an optimization of the utilization of the available<br>
transmission resources may be appropriate from the point of<br>
view of the cellular network or its network operator,<br>
respectively. In the individual case, it is quite conceivable<br>
that the access network preferred in a certain situation from<br>
the point of view of the mobile terminal (or its user,<br>
respectively) and the access network preferred from the point<br>
of view of the cellular network (or its network operator) do<br>
not match.<br>
The present invention is based on the object, therefore, of<br>
specifying an assembly by means of which the selecting of an<br>
access network to be used by a mobile terminal can be<br>
controlled in a flexible and dynamic manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by an<br>
assembly comprising a cellular network which has a mobile core<br>
network and a number of access networks for connecting mobile<br>
terminals to the mobile core network, and comprising at least<br>
one mobile<br><br>
terminal, wherein the mobile terminal has a decision unit at<br>
the terminal end for selecting the access network to be used by<br>
the mobile terminal, and the cellular network has a decision<br>
unit at the network end for selecting the access network to be<br>
used by the mobile terminal, and a control device for<br>
controlling the decision unit at the terminal end and the<br>
decision unit at the network end.<br>
The assembly according to the invention is preferred since it<br>
makes it possible to determine in a flexible and dynamic manner<br>
whether decisions with regard to the selection of the access<br>
network are to be made by the respective mobile terminal or by<br>
the cellular network. The basic flexibility that decisions can<br>
be made both by the mobile terminal and by the cellular network<br>
is given by the fact that the mobile terminal has a decision<br>
unit at the terminal end and the cellular network has a<br>
decision unit at the network end, both of which are in each<br>
case constructed for selecting the access network to be used by<br>
the mobile terminal. In addition, the decision units are<br>
preferably in each case also capable of determining the<br>
protocol or protocol layer, respectively, by means of which the<br>
connection to the selected access network is to be set up. The<br>
control device which is arranged both for controlling the<br>
decision unit at the terminal end and for controlling the<br>
decision unit at the network end makes it possible that it is<br>
possible to determine in a flexible and dynamic manner which of<br>
the two decision units are to carry out the selection of one of<br>
the available access networks. In this context, for example,<br>
the capacity utilization of the cellular network and of its<br>
access networks, respectively, or also possible disturbances,<br>
can be taken into consideration. In addition, for example, the<br>
mobile terminals of users having high turnovers can be allowed<br>
a free selection of the access<br><br>
network to be used whilst the access network to be used is<br>
selected at the network end for the mobile terminals of the<br>
remaining users.<br>
In this context, it must be noted that generally both the use<br>
of the decision unit at the network end and the use of the<br>
decision unit at the terminal end for selecting the access<br>
network to be used by the mobile terminal has advantages and<br>
disadvantages. Thus, a mobile terminal, in comparison with the<br>
cellular network, for example, only has limited information,<br>
particularly with regard to the overall situation of the<br>
cellular network. For this reason, the cellular network, more<br>
than the mobile terminal, should be generally capable of making<br>
decisions which are of use to the overall system consisting of<br>
the cellular network and mobile terminal (or a multiplicity of<br>
mobile terminals, respectively). However, selecting the access<br>
network to be used by the decision unit at the network end has<br>
the disadvantage that the decision unit at the network end must<br>
make corresponding decisions for a multiplicity of mobile<br>
terminals in this case. There is thus a risk that the decision<br>
unit at the network end becomes a bottleneck for the cellular<br>
network. In this case, the selection of the access network can<br>
be unnecessarily delayed due to the high load on the decision<br>
unit at the network end and the delay to be expected in the<br>
transmission of the decision from the decision unit at the<br>
network end to the mobile terminal. Due to its flexibility, the<br>
assembly according to the invention advantageously avoids the<br>
disadvantages of a rigid selection at the terminal end or at<br>
the network end of the access network to be used. In this<br>
context, it is preferably also possible that the control device<br>
instructs the decision unit at the terminal end and the<br>
decision unit at the network end to communicate<br><br>
with one another and to jointly select the access network to be<br>
used.<br>
It should be generally pointed out that both the decision units<br>
and the control device are logical components. This means that<br>
these devices are defined by their function and do not<br>
necessarily need to be implemented in the form of separate<br>
hardware such as, for example, a special network node or a<br>
separate electronic logic chip. Instead, the corresponding<br>
function, for example of the control device, can be<br>
implemented, for example, as additional function of an existing<br>
network node or, for example, can also be distributed over a<br>
number of network nodes.<br>
The assembly according to the invention is preferably designed<br>
in such a manner that the decision unit at the network end<br>
and/or the control device are arranged completely or partially<br>
in the mobile core network of the cellular network. This<br>
embodiment is advantageous since the mobile core network<br>
represents the central component of the cellular network and is<br>
thus particularly suitable for implementing the decision unit<br>
at the network end and the control device. The decision unit at<br>
the network end and the control device can be preferably<br>
implemented in the form of a common component in the mobile<br>
core network.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the assembly according to the<br>
invention can also be designed in such a manner that the<br>
decision unit at the terminal end and/or the decision unit at<br>
the network end is or are constructed for selecting the access<br>
network to be used by the mobile terminal by means of<br>
programmable or configurable rules. This is advantageous since<br>
it can be established in a simple and flexible manner<br><br>
by means of programmable or configurable rules which of the<br>
available access networks is to be selected in a respective<br>
situation. In addition, it is possible to advantageously<br>
respond rapidly and flexibly to changes in the network<br>
conditions or, for example, also to the provision of a new<br>
access network by this means.<br>
The assembly according to the invention can also be<br>
advantageously designed in such a manner that the control<br>
device is constructed for controlling the decision unit at the<br>
network end and the decision unit at the terminal end by means<br>
of programmable or configurable rules. Controlling the decision<br>
unit at the network end and the decision unit at the terminal<br>
end by means of the control device by means of programmable or<br>
configurable rules is preferred since it is thus possible to<br>
modify or newly add rules in a simple manner and the behavior<br>
of the control device can thus be flexibly adapted to altered<br>
requirements. In particular, this also provides for a dynamic<br>
consideration of changes in the network conditions. In this<br>
context, individual rules can apply either to all or also only<br>
to particular mobile terminals. Furthermore, for example, rules<br>
can be created according to geographic or temporal criteria.<br>
The assembly according to the invention can also be preferably<br>
formed in such a manner that the control device is constructed<br>
for communicating activation and deactivation signals,<br>
respectively, to the decision unit at the terminal end and/or<br>
the decision unit at the network end. This embodiment is<br>
preferred since it enables the control device at any time to<br>
activate or to deactivate the decision unit at the terminal end<br>
and/or at the network end. The control device can thus<br>
generally specify whether an access network is to be selected<br>
at the terminal end or at the network end.<br><br>
The assembly according to the invention can also be designed in<br>
such a manner that the mobile core network and/or at least one<br>
of the access networks has or have at least one further<br>
decision unit which can be controlled by the control device.<br>
This preferred embodiment of the assembly according to the<br>
invention makes it possible to introduce a multiplicity of<br>
decision units at the network end and to arrange these, for<br>
example, in a tree-like hierarchy. Thus, for example, the<br>
possibility exists that, in the normal case, decision units of<br>
the respective access networks select the access network to be<br>
used for the mobile terminal. If a more central control is<br>
required under certain circumstances, the decision units of the<br>
access networks as well as the decision unit at the terminal<br>
end can be deactivated by the control device and at the same<br>
time a central decision unit at a higher level in the hierarchy<br>
can be activated, for example, in the mobile core network.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the assembly according to<br>
the invention, the decision unit at the terminal end and/or the<br>
decision unit at the network end is or are constructed for<br>
selecting the access network to be used by the mobile terminal<br>
with an existing connection of the mobile terminal to one of<br>
the access networks. This embodiment is preferred since it<br>
provides for the selection of a further one of the available<br>
access networks in the case where the mobile terminal is<br>
already registered in the cellular network by means of an<br>
access network. This can be the case, for example, if the<br>
mobile terminal leaves the area of the currently used access<br>
network due to a change in location. In addition, however, a<br>
change of access network can also be triggered by various other<br>
events such as, for example, a weather-related change in the<br>
network conditions<br><br>
or the use of a certain service by the mobile terminal which<br>
renders another access network necessary or desirable. It<br>
should be pointed out that, in principle, as a result of the<br>
selection of the access network to be used, an acknowledgement<br>
of the access network already currently used can also exist.<br>
This can happen, for example, if a change of the access network<br>
does not bring any advantages or is not possible for certain<br>
reasons in the relevant situation from the point of view of the<br>
decision unit concerned.<br>
The assembly according to the invention is preferably designed<br>
in such a manner that the decision unit at the terminal end<br>
and/or the decision unit at the network end is or are<br>
constructed for selecting the access network to be used by the<br>
mobile terminal when the mobile terminal is switched on. This<br>
makes it advantageously possible that the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end or the decision unit at the network end carries<br>
out a selection of the access network to be used even when the<br>
mobile terminal is switched on, i.e. in a situation in which<br>
the mobile terminal is not yet registered in any of the<br>
available access networks.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the assembly according to<br>
the invention, the control device is connected to a further<br>
control device of a further cellular network. This embodiment<br>
provides the advantage that control information can be<br>
exchanged between the control devices of cellular networks of<br>
different network operators. As a result, for example, the<br>
control device of the further cellular network can be informed<br>
about the criteria according to which it is intended to control<br>
the decision unit at the terminal end and the decision unit at<br>
the network end for mobile terminals of users of<br><br>
the cellular network. In real terms, the control information<br>
can state, for example, that certain "premium" users, i.e.<br>
users with high turnovers or a special contract, are to be<br>
allowed a free selection of the access network by means of the<br>
decision unit at the terminal end. In this context, it is up to<br>
the control device of the further cellular network (or its<br>
network operator) to decide whether the received control<br>
information is taken into consideration - wholly or<br>
partially - in the further cellular network, or not.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a method for the<br>
operation of an assembly comprising a cellular network which<br>
has a mobile core network and a number of access networks for<br>
connecting mobile terminals to the mobile core network, and<br>
comprising at least one mobile terminal.<br>
With regard to the method, the invention is based on the object<br>
of specifying a method in which the selecting of an access<br>
network to be used by a mobile terminal can be controlled in a<br>
flexible and dynamic manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a method<br>
for the operation of an assembly comprising a cellular network<br>
which has a mobile core network and a number of access networks<br>
for connecting mobile terminals to the mobile core network, and<br>
comprising at least one mobile terminal, wherein the terminal<br>
has a decision unit at the terminal end for selecting the<br>
access network to be used by the mobile terminal and the<br>
cellular network has a decision unit at the network end for<br>
selecting the access network to be used by the mobile terminal,<br>
comprising the following method step: controlling the decision<br>
unit at the terminal end and/or the decision unit<br><br>
at the network end by means of a control device arranged in the<br>
cellular network.<br>
The method according to the invention is advantageous since it<br>
provides for a control at the network end of the decision unit<br>
at the terminal end and of the decision unit at the network end<br>
by the control device arranged in the cellular network. By this<br>
means, it is possible to specify in a flexible manner which of<br>
the two decision units is to perform the selection of the<br>
access network to be used by the mobile terminal. This<br>
advantageously dispenses with the necessity of generally and<br>
thus inflexibly specifying whether the access network to be<br>
used is to be selected at the terminal end or at the network<br>
end.<br>
The method according to the invention preferably proceeds in<br>
such a manner that a decision unit and/or control device at the<br>
network end, arranged completely or partially in the mobile<br>
core network of the cellular network, is used. Using a control<br>
device arranged in the mobile core network of the cellular<br>
network is preferred since the mobile core network is connected<br>
to the various access networks of the cellular network and, as<br>
a result, central control is made possible.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method according<br>
to the invention, the decision unit at the terminal end and/or<br>
the decision unit at the network end is or are controlled by<br>
the control device by means of configurable or programmable<br>
rules. As has already been explained previously in conjunction<br>
with the assembly according to the invention, the use of<br>
configurable or programmable rules is preferred since it<br>
4<br>
provides for a particularly high measure of flexibility and<br>
simple applicability.<br><br>
The method according to the invention can also be designed in<br>
such a manner that a deactivation signal is communicated from<br>
the control device to the decision unit at the terminal end,<br>
and an activation signal is communicated from the control<br>
device to the decision unit at the network end. This embodiment<br>
provides the advantage that, for example in the case where,<br>
most of all, decisions are made by the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end, the decision unit at the terminal end can be<br>
deactivated and at the same time the decision unit at the<br>
network end can be activated, if necessary in dependence on the<br>
situation.<br>
Furthermore, the method according to the invention can also<br>
proceed in such a manner that an activation signal is<br>
communicated from the control device to the decision unit at<br>
the terminal end, and a deactivation signal is communicated<br>
from the control device to the decision unit at the network<br>
end. This embodiment is advantageous since it enables the<br>
decision-making power to be transferred from the decision unit<br>
at the network end to the respective decision unit at the<br>
terminal end.<br>
The method according to the invention can also be preferably<br>
designed in such a manner that the control device controls at<br>
least one further decision unit of the mobile core network<br>
and/or at least one further decision unit of at least one of<br>
the access networks. This provides the advantage that a number<br>
of decision units can be provided at the network end, all of<br>
which are controlled by the control device. In this context,<br>
further decentralized decision units provide the advantage, for<br>
example, that overloading of a central decision unit which must<br><br>
make the decisions for all mobile terminals is avoided.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention, the control device communicates control information<br>
to a control device of a further cellular network. In<br>
accordance with the statements in conjunction with the assembly<br>
according to the invention, this provides for control even in<br>
the case of cellular networks of different network operators,<br>
i.e. in the case where the change of access network entails the<br>
change of the network operator supplying the mobile terminal.<br>
This is frequently the case, for example, in the case of<br>
so-called "roaming", i.e. for instance if the mobile terminal<br>
is used in a different country (i.e. in a foreign country with<br>
reference to the usual home network).<br>
The invention also relates to a mobile terminal for use in a<br>
cellular network comprising a number of access networks and a<br>
mobile core network connected to the access networks.<br>
With respect to the mobile terminal, the invention is based on<br>
the object of specifying a mobile terminal which provides for a<br>
flexible and dynamic control of the selection of an access<br>
network to be used.<br>
This object is achieved by a mobile terminal for use in a<br>
cellular network comprising a number of access networks and a<br>
mobile core network connected to the access networks,<br>
comprising a decision unit at the terminal end for selecting<br>
the access network to be used by the mobile terminal, receiving<br>
means for receiving an activation signal or a deactivation<br>
signal from a control device of the cellular network and<br>
control means for activating and deactivating, respectively,<br>
the decision unit at the terminal end.<br><br>
The mobile terminal according to the invention is preferred<br>
since it has a decision unit at the terminal end which, if<br>
necessary, can be activated and deactivated, respectively, by<br>
the control device of the cellular network.<br>
The mobile terminal according to the invention is preferably<br>
designed in such a manner that the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end is constructed for selecting the access network to<br>
be used by the mobile terminal by means of programmable or<br>
configurable rules. This provides the advantage that the<br>
network operator or the user of the mobile terminal, for<br>
example, can specify in a simple manner the criteria according<br>
to which the selection is to take place for the most varied<br>
situations which can make it necessary to select an access<br>
network to be used.<br>
The mobile terminal according to the invention can be<br>
advantageously designed in such a manner that the decision unit<br>
at the terminal end is constructed for selecting the access<br>
network to be used by the mobile terminal with an existing<br>
connection of the mobile terminal to one of the access<br>
networks. This is advantageous since the mobile terminal can<br>
thus select a further one of the available access networks also<br>
in the case where it is already registered in one of the<br>
available access networks. This can happen, for example, in the<br>
case of a deterioration in the transmission quality, for<br>
instance due to leaving the coverage of the access network<br>
currently used or due to the most varied further events.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end is constructed for selecting the access network to<br>
be used by the mobile terminal when<br><br>
the mobile terminal is switched on. This advantageously<br>
provides for a selection at the terminal end of the access<br>
network to be used also in the case where no connection is yet<br>
set up to one of the access networks. In addition, the<br>
invention relates to a control device in a cellular network<br>
which has a mobile core network and a number of access networks<br>
for connecting at least one mobile terminal to the mobile core<br>
network.<br>
With respect to the control device, the invention is based on<br>
the object of specifying a control device which provides for<br>
flexible and dynamic control of the selection of an access<br>
network to be used.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a<br>
control device in a cellular network which has a mobile core<br>
network and a number of access networks for connecting at least<br>
one mobile terminal to the mobile core network, wherein the<br>
control device has control means for controlling at least one<br>
decision unit at the terminal end, used for selecting the<br>
access network to be used by the mobile terminal, and for<br>
controlling a decision unit at the network end, used for<br>
selecting the access network to be used by the mobile terminal,<br>
in the cellular network.<br>
The control device according to the invention is preferred<br>
since it provides both for controlling the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end and for controlling the decision unit at the<br>
network end.<br>
The control device according to the invention is preferably<br>
formed in such a manner that the control device is constructed<br>
for controlling the decision unit at the terminal end and the<br>
decision unit at the network end by means of programmable or<br>
configurable rules. In accordance with the previous statements,<br><br>
the use of programmable or configurable rules is preferred due<br>
to the flexibility provided as a result and the possibility of<br>
taking into consideration changes or extensions in a rapid and<br>
simple manner.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the control device according to the<br>
invention is constructed for communicating activation and<br>
deactivation signals, respectively, to the decision unit at the<br>
terminal end and/or the decision unit at the network end. The<br>
control device can thus advantageously specify in dependence on<br>
a situation whether the selection decisions should be made at<br>
the terminal end or at the network end.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the control device according<br>
to the invention is constructed for controlling at least one<br>
further decision unit of the mobile core network and/or at<br>
least one further decision unit of at least one of the access<br>
networks. This is advantageous since the control device can<br>
thus also control a multiplicity of decision units in the<br>
cellular network. These decision units at the network end can<br>
in each case be directly connected to the control device or<br>
arranged in a hierarchical structure.<br>
The control device according to the invention preferably has<br>
means for connecting to a further control device of a further<br>
cellular network. This advantageously provides for a<br>
transmission of information between the control devices of the<br>
two cellular networks.<br>
For the further explanation of the invention,<br>
figure 1 shows in a diagrammatic sketch an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the assembly according to the invention<br>
with an exemplary embodiment of the mobile<br><br>
terminal according to the invention and an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the control device according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
figure 2 shows a second exemplary embodiment of the assembly<br>
according to the invention with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the mobile terminal according to the<br>
invention and an exemplary embodiment of the control<br>
device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
assembly according to the invention. A mobile terminal 1 is<br>
shown which has a decision unit 2 at the terminal end.<br>
Furthermore, an access network 3 which has a decision unit 4 at<br>
the network end and an access network 5 which has a decision<br>
unit 6 at the network end are shown. The two access networks 3<br>
and 5, which can be those according to an arbitrary radio<br>
standard such as, for example, the GPRS (General Packet Radio<br>
Service), the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System),<br>
the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), the CDMA<br>
(Code Division Multiple Access), or the WLAN (Wireless Local<br>
Area Network) standard, are connected to a mobile core network<br>
7 and, together with this, form a cellular network.<br>
The mobile core network 7 has a decision unit 8 at the network<br>
end and a control device 10. The control device 10 is connected<br>
to the decision units 4, 6 and 8 at the network end and can<br>
send signaling or control messages to the decision unit 2 at<br>
the terminal end. This occurs via one of the two access<br>
networks 3 and 5, a direct connection between the control<br>
device 10 and the mobile terminal 1<br><br>
being drawn in figure 1 for reasons of clarity. It should be<br>
noted generally that in figure 1, only the connections between<br>
the various components which are of the greatest importance for<br>
the explanation of the invention are indicated, the arrows<br>
indicating that control is effected by the control device 10.<br>
If the mobile terminal 1 then changes its geographic location,<br>
for example, as indicated by the thick vertical arrows, the<br>
mobile terminal 1 may leave the geographic coverage of the<br>
access network currently used by it, which is not shown in<br>
figure 1. In this situation, the necessity exists that a<br>
selection of the access network to be used from the set of the<br>
two basically available access networks 3 and 5 is carried out<br>
by or for the mobile terminal 1, respectively. As an<br>
alternative, the situation could also exist that the mobile<br>
terminal 1 has just been switched on and a selection of one of<br>
the access networks 3 and 5 is required for this reason. Other<br>
scenarios which lead to a selection of one of a number of<br>
available access networks are conceivable such as, for example,<br>
starting of a service for which the access network currently<br>
used is unsuitable due to its characteristics.<br>
In principle, the access network to be used can be selected<br>
both by the decision unit 2 at the terminal end and by one of<br>
the decision units 4, 6 or 8 at the network end. In this<br>
context, it depends on the respective situation and the given<br>
boundary conditions whether a decision at the terminal end or<br>
at the network end is to be preferred. The control device 10<br>
makes it possible then to dynamically establish whether the<br>
decision unit 2 at the terminal end or one of the decision<br>
units<br><br>
4, 6 or 8 at the network end should take over the selection of<br>
the access network. In this context, the control device 10 can<br>
also specify, if necessary, which one of the decision units 4,<br>
6 or 8 at the network end is to make the selection decision. In<br>
this context, the control device 10 is controlled by<br>
configurable or programmable rules. Thus, the control device 10<br>
can use, for example, individual rules for each mobile terminal<br>
(e.g. 1) or for its user, respectively. In addition, rules can<br>
also be defined which apply to all mobile terminals or a<br>
predetermined selection of mobile terminals such as, e.g., for<br>
those which are located in a predetermined location area. In<br>
this context, the rules are deposited in a storage device, not<br>
shown in figure 1, which is allocated to the control device 10.<br>
The most varied scenarios are conceivable which can lead to the<br>
control device 10 having a controlling effect on the decision<br>
units 2, 4, 6, 8. Thus, for example, it can be defined by the<br>
network operator that, in the standard case, each mobile<br>
terminal should be allowed to select the access network used by<br>
it by itself. In this case, the decision unit 2 of the mobile<br>
terminal 1 makes the corresponding decision, for example on the<br>
basis of rules defined for the mobile terminal 1 which may be<br>
stored for example in a storage device of the mobile terminal<br>
1. The storage device can be a fixed component of the mobile<br>
terminal 1 or a memory card, which can be separated from the<br>
mobile terminal 1, for example in the form of a SIM (Subscriber<br>
Identity Module) card used for customization of mobile<br>
terminals.<br><br>
One rule can specify, for example, that the access network with<br>
the lowest costs, the highest data transmission rate or the<br>
best transmission quality should be selected. In addition, much<br>
more complex conditions can also be defined with the aid of the<br>
rules.<br>
As an alternative, the network operator of the cellular network<br>
could decide that the decision of mobility (i.e. the selection<br>
of the access network to be used) should be made at the network<br>
end for the mobile terminal 1 (or all mobile terminals using<br>
the cellular network) . In this case, the control device 10 of<br>
the mobile core network 7 would send a deactivation signal to<br>
the decision unit 2 at the terminal end of the mobile terminal<br>
1 and at the same time send an activation signal, for example,<br>
to the decision unit 8 at the network end in the mobile core<br>
network 7 of the cellular network. This has the result that<br>
selection is switched from a selection at the terminal end of<br>
the access network used to a selection at the network end. The<br>
decision unit 8 at the network end can then delegate the<br>
decision-making power - if it has been allowed to do this by<br>
the control device 10 - to the decision units 4 and 6 at the<br>
network end arranged in the access networks 3 and 5. In this<br>
case, the decision units 4 and 6 at the network end thus make<br>
the decisions with regard to the selection of access network by<br>
means of the rules available to them. In addition, the rules to<br>
be applied can also be communicated to the decision units 4 and<br>
6 at the network end by the decision unit 8 at the network end<br>
or the control device 10.<br>
Apart from the scenarios, previously described, of a general<br>
decision at the terminal end about the selection of access<br>
network or of a general selection at the network end, there is<br>
the possibility of further, more differentiated procedures.<br><br>
Thus, for example, the information that one of the access<br>
networks is overloaded in a certain region of the cellular<br>
network can be present in the mobile core network 7. In this<br>
case, the control device 10 instructs all mobile terminals<br>
(e.g. 1) in this region and the adjoining regions to deactivate<br>
their decision unit at the terminal end (e.g. 2). Since the<br>
decision unit 8 at the network end has information on the<br>
overloaded region, it can make decisions for the selection of<br>
access network for the mobile terminals affected (e.g. 1) in<br>
such a manner that the overloaded access network is avoided as<br>
far as possible in the region concerned. The same applies, for<br>
example, to the case where maintenance work is carried out in<br>
one of the available access networks in a predetermined region.<br>
In this case, the control device 10 can again switch off the<br>
decision units at the terminal end of the mobile terminals<br>
located in the region (e.g. 1) so that the decision unit 8 at<br>
the network end can leave the relevant access network in the<br>
region concerned out of consideration in the selection for the<br>
duration of the maintenance work. In general, the control<br>
device 10 and the decision unit 8 at the network end can be<br>
preferably implemented in one component which simplifies the<br>
assembly.<br>
In addition, it is conceivable that a network operator, in<br>
order to avoid overload situations, allows a free selection of<br>
the access network at any time only to preferred users. In this<br>
case, the decision unit 10 can instruct the mobile terminals of<br>
users not preferred in this way to switch off their decision<br>
units at the terminal end in heavy-traffic periods.<br>
It is also conceivable that, for example, a set of rules which<br>
overwrites the rules present in the mobile terminal 1<br><br>
is communicated to the decision unit 2 at the terminal end by<br>
the control device 10. The communicated rules can be, for<br>
example, instructions of the type "avoid access network A in<br>
location area xyz" or "prefer UMTS instead of WLAN". These<br>
instructions can also be provided with validity periods so that<br>
the mobile terminals (e.g. 1) can carry out the selection of<br>
access network largely autonomously outside the periods<br>
concerned.<br>
Furthermore, a statistical mode is also conceivable in which<br>
the decision unit 2 at the terminal end is instructed to make<br>
the decision about the selection of access network by itself<br>
only when a random number generated from the range of values of<br>
0 to 10 has, for example, a value of greater than 3. If this is<br>
not the case, the decision about selection should be made at<br>
the network end for the corresponding mobile terminal.<br>
In general, the control device 10 thus provides the possibility<br>
of adapting in a dynamic, situation-dependent and flexible<br>
manner the responsibility for selecting the access network to<br>
be used between the decision unit 2 at the terminal end and the<br>
decision units 4, 6 and 8 at the network end. As a result, a<br>
meaningful and dynamic compromise between the aim of greatest<br>
possible independence of the mobile terminal 1 and central<br>
control of the selection of the access network by the cellular<br>
network is advantageously provided for. Under normal<br>
conditions, the mobile terminal 1 can thus independently select<br>
the access network to be used by it by means of the decision<br>
unit 2 at the terminal end. This avoids unnecessary signaling<br>
between the cellular network and the mobile terminal 1.<br>
Furthermore, a high real-time capability is ensured,<br><br>
i.e. the mobile terminal 1 (and similarly all other mobile<br>
terminals which use the cellular network) can react in the<br>
fastest possible way to changing network conditions. Under<br>
certain circumstances, however, it is advantageous or of<br>
fundamental significance, respectively, that the selection of<br>
the access network can be influenced at the network end for the<br>
mobile terminal 1. The control device 10 then makes it possible<br>
to perform a selection of the access network at the network end<br>
for predetermined mobile terminals (e.g. 1) for example in<br>
selected regions and under certain conditions. As a result, the<br>
decisions can be made in such a manner that they provide the<br>
best possible result for the overall system from the point of<br>
view of the cellular network.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the assembly<br>
according to the invention. In contrast to figure 1, it shows<br>
the case where access networks 23, 24, 25 and 26 of two<br>
different network operators which in each case have an<br>
independent mobile core network 27 and 32, respectively, can be<br>
of use to a mobile terminal 21 which has a decision unit 22 at<br>
the terminal end. The mobile core networks 27 and 32 of the two<br>
cellular networks in each case have their own control device 28<br>
and 30, respectively, and their own decision units 29 and 31 at<br>
the network end.<br>
To enable the network operator of the cellular network with the<br>
mobile core network 27, to which the user of the mobile<br>
terminal 21 has a contractual relation, to specify the extent<br>
to which the mobile terminal 21 is allowed to perform an<br>
independent selection of the access network by means of its<br>
decision unit 22 even in the utilization of one of the other<br>
two access networks 25 and 2 6 by the mobile terminal 21, the<br>
control device 28 of the cellular network with the mobile core<br>
network 27 transmits to the control device 30 of the mobile<br>
core network 32 of the<br><br>
cellular network of the other network operator a set of general<br>
decision rules. These rules describe the behavior desired by<br>
the network operator for mobile terminals of his users in the<br>
case of a stay in the cellular network of the other network<br>
operator. Thus, the network operator can specify, for example,<br>
that a preferred user should be authorized for a free selection<br>
of the access network even in this case whilst this should not<br>
be the case for other users. In this context, the extent to<br>
which the rules communicated by the control device 28 are<br>
observed lies ultimately in the decision-making power of the<br>
control device 30 of the mobile core network 32 of the other<br>
network operator.<br>
It should be pointed out that, in the exemplary embodiment of<br>
figure 2, a decision unit 28 or 30 at the network end is in<br>
each case only present in the mobile core networks 27 and 32,<br>
i.e. the access networks 23, 24, 25 and 2 6 themselves do not<br>
have any further decision units at the network end.<br><br><br>
