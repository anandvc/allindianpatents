This invention relates to a process for producing an optically active aldehyde.<br>
Asymmetric synthesis is of importance, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry, since frequently only one optically active isomer (enantiomer) is therapeutically active. An example of such a pharmaceutical product is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen. The S enantiomer is a potent antiarthritic agent while the R enantiomer is a liver toxin. It is therefore oftentimes desirable to selectively produce one particular enantiomer over its mirror image.<br>
It is known that special precautions must be taken to ensure production of a desired enantiomer because of the tendency to produce optically inactive racemic mixtures, that is equal amounts of each mirror image enantiomer whose opposite optical activities cancel out each other. In order to obtain the desired enantiomer (or mirror image stereoisomer) from such a racemic mixture, the racemic mixture must be separated into its optically active components. This separation, known as optical resolution, may be carried out by actual physical sorting, direct crystallization of the<br><br>
racemic mixture, or other metiiods known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent 4,242,193). Such optical resolution procedures are ofben laborious and expensive as well as destructive to the desired enantiomer. Due to these difiEiculties, increased attention has been placed upon asymmetric synthesis in whidi one of the enantiomers is obtained in significantly greater amoimts than the other enantiomer. Ef&amp;dent asymmetric synthesis desirably affords the ability to control both regioselectivity Gjranched/normal isomer ratio in hydroformylation of terminal olefins) and stereoselectivity.<br>
Various asymmetric synthesis catalysts have been described in the art. For example, Wink, Donald J. et al., Inorg. Chem. 1990, 29, 5006-5008 discloses the synthesis of chelating bis(dioxaphospholane) ligands through chlorodioxaphospholane intermediates and the utility of bis(phosphite)rhodium cations in hydrogenation catalysis. A complex derived fi:om dihydrobenzoin was tested as a precursor in the hydroformylation of olefins and gave a racemic mixture.   Cationic rhodiiun complexes of bisCdioxaphospholane) ligands were tested in the hydrogenation of enamides and gave enantiomeric excesses on the order of 2-10%,<br>
Pettier, Y. et al.. Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 370,1989,333-342 describes the asymmetric hydroformylation of sl^rene using rhodium catalysts modified with aminophosphine-phosphinite ligands. Enantioselectivities greater than 30% ee are reportedly obtained.<br>
East Germany Patents Nos. 275,623 and 280,473 relate to chiral rhodium carbohydrate-phosphinite catalyst production. The catalysts are stated to be useful as stereospedfic catalysts for carrying out carbon-carbon bond formation, hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, carbonylation and hydrogenation reactions to give optically active compounds.<br><br>
Stile et al., Organometallics 1991,10,1183-1189 relates to the synthesis of three complexes of platinum Il-containing the chiral Ugands: l-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-(2S, 4S)-2-[(diphenyl-phosphino)metiiyl]-4-(dibenzophospholyl)pyrrolidme; l-(tert-butoxycarbonylH2S,4S)-2-[(dibenzophos- pholyl)methyl]-4-(diphenylphosphino)pyrrolidine; and l-(tertrbuto^carbonyl)-(2S,4S)-4-(dibenzophospholyl)-2-[(dibenzophospholyl)methyl]pyrrolidine. Asjrmmetric hydroformylation of vinyl arenes (including methoxyvinylnaphthalene) was examined with use of platinum complexes of these three ligands in the presence of stannous chloride as catalyst.  Various branched/normal ratios (0.5-3.2) and enantiomeric excess values (12-77%) were obtained. When the reactions were carried out in the presence of triethyl orthoformate to improve on the enantiomeric purity of the products, all four catalysts gave virtually complete enantioselectivity (ee&gt;96%) and similar brsmched/normal ratios.  A similar disclosiu'e appears in pubUshed PCT patent application WO 88/08835<br>
PubHshed Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent AppHcation 93/03839 (Babin et al.) relates to asymmetric syntheses processes in which a prochiral or chiral compoimd is reacted in the presence of an optically active metal-Ugand complex catalyst to produce an optically active product. The processes of Babm et al. are distinctive in that they provide good yields of optically active products having high stereoselectivity, high regioselectivity, and good reaction rate without the need for optical resolution. The processes of Babin et al. stereoselectively produce a chiral center. An advantage of the processes of Babin et al. is that optically active products can be   % synthesized firom optically inactive reactants. Another advantage of the processes of Babin et al, is that yield losses associated with the production of an undesired enantiomer can be substantially reduced. The asjmametric syntheses'processes of Babin et al. are useful for the production of numerous optically active organic compounds, e.g.,<br><br>
aldehydes, alcohols, ethers, esters, amines, amides, carbbxylic acids and the like, which have a wide variety of appUcations. Despite the remarkable advance in the art represented by Babin et al, there remains further room for improvement with respect to the enantiomeric purify of the optically active aldehyde isomers produced by the Babin et al. processes.<br>
Enantiomeric purification of enantiomerically enriched compounds (e.g., by crystaUization) is a well known process and has been observed for many compotinds. However, the ability to purify a chiral product via crystaUization varies widely fi'om compound to compound and even closely related compoiuids may behave very differently. There appears to be no prior art relating to the enantiomeric purification of enantiomerically enriched aldehyde mixtures, particularly mixtures of R- and S-2-(6-niethoxy-2-naphthyDpropionaldehyde, by crystallization. The following pubHcations are illustrative of prior art related to the crystaUization of S-ibuprofen and S-naproxen adds, their sodimn salts and 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionitrile from enantiomeric mixtures thereof. These references do not disclose crystallization of enantiomeric aldehyde mixtiures.<br>
Manimaran, T.; Stably, G.P. Tetrahedron:   Asymmetry 1993, 4,1949, "Optical Purification of Profen Drugs," discloses the crystallization of the sodiiun salts of S-ibuprofen and S-naproxen. CrystaUization of the sodium salts results in significant improvement in the enantiomeric purity of the product. The article includes phase diagrams for S-ibuprof6n and S-naproxen adds and several salts of each. The article also desmbes some fiindamenCal prindples governing the enantiomeric purification of products via crystallization.<br>

crystallization of various Ibuprofen salts as a means of improving enantiomeric purity.<br>
Pringle, P.; Murray, W.T.; Thompson, D.K.; Choudhury, A.A.; Patil, D.R. U.S. Patent 5,260,482,1993, "Enantiomeric Resolution," discloses the use of hydrates of the sodiiun salt of ibuprofen in crystallization processes which result in enantiomeric purification of the product.<br>
Rajanbabu, T.V.; Casalnuovo, A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 6265, "Tailored Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis: The Hydrocyanation of Vinylarenes," discloses the preparation and use of catalysts for the hydrocyanation of vinylarenes as a route for the preparation of S-ibuprofen and S-naproxen,  The authors comment, although no experimental details are given, that enantiomerically enriched mixtures of 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphtJiyl)propionitrile may be purified by crystallization.<br>
The prior art relating to enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures does not disclose the use of crystallization to separate the enantiomers firom each other. Thus, in the Stille et al. article discussed above, there is no mention of crystallizing aldehyde mixtures to improve their enantiomeric piuity. Babin et al. discussed above discloses: "The desired optically active products, e.g., aldehydes, may be recovered in any conventional manner. Suitable separation techniques include, for example, solvent extraction, crystallization, distillation, vaporization, vdped film evaporation, falling film evaporation and the like. It may be desired to remove the optically active products fix)m the reaction system as they are formed through the use of trapping agents as desmbe<f4n wo patent babin et al. does not disclose the use of crystallization to separate enantiomeric aldehydes from each other.></f4n><br><br><br><br>

Detailed Description Forming Aldehyde Mixture<br>
This invention encompasses first providing a suitable enantiomeric aldehyde mixture. Such mixtures can be provided by such known processes as non-asymmetric processes (e.g., non-asjmunetric hydroformylation, non-asjmtmietaic olefin isomerization or non-asymmetric aldol condensation) followed by conventional resolution processes (e.g., chiral chromatography, kinetic resolution or other known resolution methods). However, the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures are preferably provided by carrying out any known conventional non-as3anmetric syntiieses of aldehyde mixtures in an asymmetric fashion.  In such preferred processes, the catalyst of a conventional non-as3nnmetric Synthesis is replaced by an optically active metal-ligand complex catal3rst and the process is conducted to produce a suitable optically active aldehyde mixture. Illustrative sudi asymmetric syntheses processes include, for example, a83amnetric hydroformylation, asymmetric olefin isomerization and asymmetric aldol condensation.<br>
Preferably, the first step of the process of this invention comprises forming an enantiomeric aldehyde mixture by asjonmetric hydroformylation.  Such asymmetric hydroformylation processes involve the use of an optically active metal-phosphorus<br><br>
ligand complex catalyst and, optionally, free ligand to produce optically active aldehydes by reacting a prochiral or chiral olefinic compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The optically active aldehydes produced in this preferred first step of the process of this invention are compoiuids obtained by the addition of a formyl group to an olefinically unsaturated carbon atom in the starting material with simtdtaneous saturation of the olefinic bond. The processing techniques of this preferred first step of the process of this invention may correspond to any of the known processing techniques heretofore employed in conventional asymmetric syntheses reactions, including asymmetric hydroformylation reactions.  For instance, the asymmetric sjmtheses processes can be conducted in continuous, semi-continuous or batch fashion and can involve a Uquid recycle operation if desired. This step of processes of this invention are preferably conducted in batch fashion. Likewise, the manner or order of addition of the reaction ingredients, catalyst and solvent are also not critical and may be accomplished in any conventional fashion.<br>
Alternatively, as the first step in the process of this invention, asymmetric olefin isomerization can be carried out in accordance with conventional procedures known in the art to produce the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures used in this invention. For example, allylic alcohols can be isomerized under isomerization conditions in the presence of an optically active metal-ligand complex catalyst described herein to produce optically active aldehydes.<br>
Also alternatively, as the first step in the process of this invention, asymmetric aldol condensation can be carried out in accordance with conventional procedtu^s known in the art to produce the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures used in this invention; For example, optically active aldehydes can be prepared by reacting a prochiral aldehyde and a stiyl enol ether under aldol condensation<br><br>
conditions in the presence of an optically active metal-ligand complex catalyst described herein.<br>
In general, the above-mentioned asymmetric synthesis processes are carried out in a hquid reaction medimu that contains a solvent for the optically active catalyst, preferably one in which tiie reaction ingredients including catalyst are substantially soluble. In addition, it may be desured that the asymmetric syntheses processes be effected in the presence of free ligand as well as in the presence of the optically active complex catalyst. By "free Hgand" is meant Ugand that is not complexed with the metal atom in the optically active complex catalyst.<br>
The prochiral and chiral starting materials useful in the processes for produong the enemtiomeric aldehyde mixtures employed in the process of the present this invention are chosen depending on the particular asymmetric synthesis process that is used. Sudi starting materials are well known in the art and can be used in conventional amounts in accordance with conventional methods.  Illustrative starting material reactants include, for example, substituted and unsubstituted aldehydes (for aldol condensation processes), prochiral olefins (for hydroformylation processes) and ketones (for aldol condensation processes) and the like.<br>
Illustrative olefin starting material reactants usefrd in certain of the asymmetric syntiiesis processes usefrd in producing the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures employed in this invention (e.g., asymmetric hydroformylation) include those which can be terminally or internally imsaturated and be of straight chain,   ^ branched-chain or cychc structure.  Such olefins can contain from 2 to 40 carbon atoms or greater and may contain one or more ethyleiiic unsaturated groups. Moreover, such olefins may contain groups or substituents which do not essentially adversely interfere with the asynmietric syntheses process such as carbonyl, carbonyloxy, oxy,<br><br>
hydros, oxycarbonyl, halogen, alkozy, aiyl, haloall^l, and the like. Illustrative olefLnic unsaturated compounds indude substituted and unsubstituted alpha olefins, internal olefins, all^l alkenoates, alkenyl alkanoates, alkenyl aU^l ethers, alkenols and the like, e.g., 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-octadecene, 2-butene, isoamylene, 2-pentene, 2-hezene, 3-hexene, 2-heptene, cyclohexene, propylene dimers, propylene trimers, propylene tetramers, 2-ethylhexene, 3-phenyl-l-propene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 3-cyclohexyl-l-butene, allyl alcohol, hex-1-en-4-ol, oct-l-en-4-ol, vinyl acetate, allyl acetate, 3-butenyl acetate, vinyl propionate, allyl propionate, allyl butyrate, methyl methacrylate, 3-butenyl acetate, vinyl ethyl ether, allyl ethyl ether, n-propyl-7-octenoate, 3-butenenitrile, 5-hexenamide, styrene, norbomene, alpha-methylstyrene and the Uke. Illustrative preferred olefinic im.saturated compounds include, for example, p-isobutylst3a:ene, 2-vinyl-6-methoxy-2-naphthylene, 3-ethenylphenyl phenyl ketone, 4-ethenylphenyl-2-thienylketone, 4-ethenyl-2-fluorobiphenyl, 4-(l,3-dihydro-l-oxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl)styrene, 2-ethenyl-5-benzoylthiophene, 3-ethenylphenyl phenyl ether, propenylbenzene, isobutyl-4-propenylbenzene, phenyl vinyl etiier, vinyl chloride and the Uke. Suitable olefinic unsaturated compoxm^ds useful in certain asymmetric syntlieses processes of this invention include substituted aryl ethylenes described in U.S. Patent 4,329,507, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Mixtures of different olefinic starting materials can be employed, if desired, in the as3naunetric syntheses processes used as the first step in the process of this invention. More preferably, the first step involves hydrofonnylating alpha olefins containing fi'om 4 to 40 carbon atoms or greater and internal olefins containing fi'om 4 to 40 carbon atoms or greater or mixtures of such alpha olefins and internal olefins.<br><br>
Illustrative prochiral and chiral olefins useiful in the processes that can be employed to produce the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures that can be employed in this invention include those represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein R^, Ro, Ro and R^ are the same or different (provided R-, is different from Ro or Rg is different from R&gt;) and are selected from<br>
hydrogen; alkyl; substituted aUqd, said substitution being selected from dialkylamino such as benzylamino and dibenzylamino, alkoxy such as methoxy and ethoxy, acyloxy such as acetoxy, halo, nitro, nitrile, thio, carbonyl, carboxamide, carboxaldehyde, csirboxyl, carboxyHc ester; aryl including phenyl; substituted aryl including phenyl, said substitution being selected from alkyl, amino including alkylamino and dialkylamino such as benzylamino and dibenzylamino, hydroxy, alkoxy such a^ methoxy and etho:g^, acyloxy such as acetoxy, halo, nitrile, nitro, carboxyl, carboxaldehyde, carbo^Hc ester, carbonyl, and thio; acylo^ such as aceto^ alkoxy such as methoxy and ethox3r, amino including alkylamino and dialkylamino sudi as benzylamino £md dibenzylamino; acylamino and diacylamino such as acelylbenzylamino and diacetylamino;^ nitro; carbonyl; nitrile; carboxyl; carboxamide; carboxaldehyde; carboxylic ester; and alkylmercapto such as methylmercapto. It is tmderstood that the prochiral and chiral olefins of this definition also include molecules of the above general formula where the R-groups<br><br>
are connected to form ring compounds, e.g., S-methyl-l-cydohexene, and the like.<br>
The optically active catalyst iiseful in producing tJie aldehyde mixtures that are employed in this invention includes an optically active metal-ligand complex catalyst in which the ligand is optically active, preferably optically pure. The permissible metals which make up the optically active metal-ligand complexes include Group VIII metals selected from rhodium (Rh), cobalt (Co), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), osmium (Os) and mixtures thereof, with the preferred metals being rhodium, cobalt, iridium and ruthenium, more preferably rhodixim and ruthenimn, espedally rhodium.   Other permissible metals include Group IB metals selected from copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au) and mixtures thereof, and also Group VIB metals selected from chromiimi (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W) and mixtures thereof.  Mixtures of metals from Group VIII, Group EB and Group VIB may be used in this invention. It is to be noted that the successful practice of this invention does not depend and is not predicated on the exact structure of the optically active metal-ligand complex species, which may be present in their mononuclear, dinuclear and or higher nuclearity forms, provided the ligand is optically active. Indeed, tiie exact optically active structure is not known. Although it is not intended herein to be bound to any theory or mechanistic discourse, it appears that the optically active catal3rtic spedes may in its simplest form consist essentially of tiie metal in complex combination with the optically active ligand and, in hydroformylation, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and an olefin.<br>
The term "complex" as used herein and in the claims means a coordination compound formed by the union of one or more electronically rich molecules or atoms capable of independent existence with one or more electronically poor molecules or atoms.<br><br>
each of which is also capable of independent existence. For example,<br>
the preferred optically active ligands emplo3rable herein, i.e.,<br>
phosphorus ligands, may possess one or more phosphorus donor<br>
atoms, each having one available or imshared pair of electrons<br>
which are each capable of forming a coordinate covalent bond<br>
independently or possibly in concert (e.g., via chelation) with the<br>
metal. As can be surmised from the above discussions, carbon<br>
monoxide (which is also properly classified as ligand) can also be<br>
present and complexed with the metal. The ultimate composition of<br>
the optically active complex catalyst may also contain an additional<br>
ligand, e.g., hydrogen or an anion satisfying the coordination sites or<br>
nuclear charge of the metal.  Illustrative additional ligands include,<br>
e.g., halogen (CI, Br, I), alkyl, aryl, substituted aiyl, acyl, CF3, C2F5, CN, RgPO and RP(OXOH)0 (wherein each R is alkyl or aryl), acetate,<br>
acetylacetonate, SO^, PF^, PFg, NOg, NO3, CHgO, CH2=CHCH2,<br>
CgHgCN, CHgCN, NO, NHg, pyridine, (C2Hg)gN, mono-olefins,<br>
diolefins and triolefins, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. It is of course<br>
to be xmderstood that the optically active complex species is preferably<br>
free of any additional organic ligand or anion that might poison the catalyst and have an xindue adverse effect on catalyst performance. It is preferred in the rhodiimi-cataljrzed asymmetric hydroformylation reactions of this invention that the active catalysts be free of halogen and sulfrir directly bonded to the rhodivim, although such may not be absolutely necessary.<br>
The nmnber of available coordination sites on such metals is weU known in tiie art. Thus IJie optically active species may comprise a complex catalyst mixture, in their monomeric, dimeric or higher nuclearity forms, which are preferably characterized by at least one phosphorus-containing molecule complexed per one molecule of rhodium. As noted above, it is considered that the opticaUy active spedes of the preferred rhodi\im catalyst employed in this invention during asymmetric<br><br>
hydrofonnylation may be complexed vfiih. carbon monoxide and hydrogen in addition to the optically active phosphorus ligands in view of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas employed by the as3anmetiic hydroformylation process.<br>
Moreover, regardless of whether the optically active complex catal3rst is formed prior to intiroduction into tiie reaction zone or whether the active catalyst is prepared in situ during the reaction, the asymmetric synthesis processes (and especially the asymmetric hydroformylation processes) may, if desired, be effected in the presence of free ligand.<br>
The Ugands employable in producing the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtiires useful in this invention include those optically active ligands having the general formula:<br><br>

As used herein, the term "substituted" is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compoimds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acycUc and (cylic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocycUc, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds.  Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described hereinabove. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compoimds described herein which satisfy the valencies of the heteroatoms. This invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds.<br>
The optically active ligands employed in the complex catalysts useful in the first step of the process of this invention are uniquely adaptable and smtable for asymmetric syntheses processes,<br><br>
espedaUy rhodium-catalsrzed assniimetaic hydrofonnylation. For instance, the optically active phosphorus ligands may provide very good rhodium complex stability in addition to providing good catalytic activity for the asymmetric hydroformylation of aU types of permissible olefins.  Further, their unique diemical structure should provide the ligand with very good stability against side reactions such as being hydroljrzed during as3nnmetric hydroformylation, as well as upon storage.<br>
The tyes of novel optically active ligands of the generic class employable in the first step of the process of this invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For instance, the optically active phosphorus ligands employable in this invention can be prepared via a series of conventional phosphorus halide-alcohol or amine condensation reactions in which at least one of the alcohol or amine ingredients is optically active or optically pure. Such types of condensation reactions and the manner in which they may be conducted are well known in the art. Moreover, the phosphorus ligands employable herein can be readily identified and characterized by conventional analytical techniques, such as Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectroscopy if desired.<br>
As noted above, the optically active ligands can be employed as both the ligand of the above-described optically active metal-ligand complex catalyst as well as the fi*ee ligand that can be present in the reaction medium of the processes of this invention. In addition, while the optically active ligand of the metal-Ugand complex 'catalyst and any excess free ligand preferably present in a given process of this invention are normally the same ligand, different optically active hgands, as well as mixtures of two or more different optically active liggands, may be employed for each purpose in any given process.<br><br>
The optically active metal-ligand complex catalysts of this invention may be formed by methods kno-wn in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,769,498,4,717,775,4,774,361,4,737,588, 4,885,401,4,748,261,4,599,206,4,668,661,5,059,710 and 5,113,022, an of which are incorporated herein by reference. For instance, preformed metal hydrido^carbonyl catal3rsts may possibly be prepared and introduced into the reaction medimn of an asymmetric S3nitheses process. More preferably, the metal-ligand complex catalysts of this invention can be derived fix)m a metal catalyst precursor which may<br>
be introduced into the reaction medium for in situ formation of the active catalyst.  For example, rhodium catalyst precursors such as rhodium dicarbonyl acefylacetonate, BhnOo, BhACO)-,^, Ehg(CO)^g, Rh(NOo)q and the like may be introduced into the reaction medium along with the Ugand for the in situ formation of the active catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, rhodium dicarbonyl acetylacetonate is employed as a rhoditun precursor and reacted in the presence of a solvent with a phosphorus ligand compound to form a catalytic rhodiimi-phosphorus complex precursor which is introduced into the reactor, optionally along with excess free phosphorus hgand, for the in situ formation of tiie active catalyst. In any event, it is sufficient for the purpose of this invention to understand that an optically active metal-hgand complex catalyst is present in the . reaction medium under the conditions of the asynmmetric syntheses and more preferably asymmetric hydroformylation process.<br>
Moreover, the amount of optically active complex catalyst present in the reaction medium need only be that minimum amount necessary to provide the given metal concentration desired to be employed and which will furnish the basis for at least that catalytic amotmt of metal necessary to catalyze the particular asynunetric syntheses process desired.   In general, metal concentrations in the range of frt&gt;m about 1 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, calculated as free metal, and Ugand to metal mole ratios in the<br><br>
catalyst ranging from about 0.5:1 to about 200:1, should be sufficient for most as3amnetric syntheses processes. Moreover, in the rhodium catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation processes of this invention, it is generally preferred to employ fix)m about 10 to 1000 ppm of rhodium and more preferably from 25 to 750 ppm of rhodium, calculated as free metal.<br>
A further aspect of the first step of the process of this invention involves the use of a catalyst precursor composition consisting essentially of a solubilized metal-Ugand complex precursor catalyst, an organic solvent and free ligand.  Such precursor compositions may be prepared by forming a solution of a metal starting material, such as a metal oxide, hydride, carbonyl or salt e.g., a nitrate, which may or may not be in complex combination with an optically active ligand, an organic solvent and a free ligand as defined herein. Any suitable metal starting material may be employed, e.g., rhodiiun dicarbonyl acetylacetonate, RhgOg, Rh4(C0)12» I^6(C0)16, Rh(N0g)3, poly-phosphite rhodium carbonyl hydrides, iriditun carbonyl, poly-phosphite iridiimi carbonyl<br>
hydrides, osmium halide, chlorosmic add, osmium carbonyls, palladiimi hydride, paUadous hahdes, platinic acid, platinous halides, ruthenium carbonyls, as well as other salts of other metals and carboxylates of Co-C^g adds such as cobalt chloride, cobalt<br>
nitrate, cobalt acetate, cobalt octoate, ferric acetate, ferric nitrate, nickel fluoride, nickel sulfate, paUadiiun acetate, osmiiun octoate, iridiima sulfate, ruthenium nitrate, and the like. Of course, any suitable solvent may be employed such as those employable in the asymmetric syntheses process desired to be carried out. The desired asynmietric syntheses process may of cotirse also dictate the various ' amoiints of metal, solvent and optically active hgand present in the precursor solution.  Optically active ligands if not already complexed<br><br>
with the initial metal may be complezed to the metal either prior to or in situ during the asymmetric syntheses process.<br>
The optically active catalyst used in the first step of the process of this invention may optionally be supported. Advantages of a supported catalyst may include ease of catalyst separation and ligand recovery..  Illustrative examples of supports include alumina, silica gel, ion-exchange resins, polymeric supports and the like.<br>
The process conditions employable in the asymmetric processes that can be employed in the first step of the process of this invention are chosen depending on the particular asymmetric synthesis process.  Such process conditions are well known in the art. All of the asymmetric syntheses processes useful in this invention can be carried out in accordance with conventional procedures known in the art. Illustrative reaction conditions for conducting the asymmetric syntlieses processes of this invention are described, for example, in Bosnich, B., Asymmetric Catalysis, Martinus Nijhoff PubHshers, 1986 and Morrison, James D., As3nmmetric Synthesis, Vol. 5, Chiral Catalysis, Academic Press, Inc., 1985, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Depending on the particular process, operating temperatures can range from about -80°C or less to about 500oC or greater and operating pressures can range Gcom about 1 psig or less to about 10,000 psig or greater.<br>
The reaction conditions for efiecting the preferred as3mmietric hydroformylation process that can be employed in the first step of the process of this invention may be those heretofore conventionally used and may comprise a reaction temperature of fi'om about -25'C or lower to about 200°C and pressures ranging firom about 1 to 10,000 psia. While the preferred asymmetric syntheses process is the hydroformylation of olefinicaUy unsaturated compounds carbon mono^de and hydrogen to produce optically<br><br>
actiye aldehydes, it is to be understood that the optically active metal-ligand complexes may be employed as catalysts in other types of assmimetric syntheses processes to obtain good restilts.<br>
As noted, the first step of the preferred process of this invention involves the production of optically active aldehydes via asymmetric hydroformylation of a prochiral or chiral olefinic unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of an optically active metal-phosphorus Hgand complex catalyst £ind, optionally, fi-ee phosphorus hgand, especially, an optically active rhoditun-phosphorus hgand complex catalyst.<br>
While the optimization of the reaction conditions necessary to achieve the best results and efficiency desired are dependent upon experience in the utiHzation of this invention, only a certain measure of experimentation should be necessary to ascertain those conditions which are optimum for a given situation and such should be well within the knowledge of one skilled in the art and easily obtainable by following the more preferred aspects of this invention as explained herein and/or be simple routine experimentation. For instance, the total gas pressm-e of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and olefinic unsattirated starting compotmd of the preferred asymmetric hydroformylation process of this invention may range fi-om about 1 to about 10,000 psia. More preferably, however, in the asymmetric hydroformylation of prochiral olefins to produce optically active aldehydes, it is preferred that the process be operated at a total gas pressing of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and olefinic unsaturated starting compound of less than about 1500 psia, and more preferably less than about 1000 psia. The minimum total pressure of the reactants is not particularly critical and is limited predominately only by the amount of reactants necessary to obtain a desired rate of reaction. More specifically, the carbon monoxide partial pressiire of the asymmetric hydroformylation process of this invention is preferably fi'om about 1 to about 360 psia, and more<br><br>
preferably from about 3 to about 270 psia, while the Iqrdrogen partial pressure is preferably about 15 to about 480 psia and more preferably from about 30 to about 300 psia. In general, the molar ratio of gaseous hydrogen to carbon monoxide may range from about 1:10 to 100:1 or higher, the more preferred hydrogen to carbon monoxide molar ratio being from about 1:1 to about 1:10. Higher molar ratios of carbon monoxide to gaseous hydrogen may generally tend to favor higher branched/normal isomer ratios.<br>
Further as noted above, the preferred asynmietric hydroformylation process useful in the first step of the process of this invention may be conducted at a reaction temperatiire from about -25°C or lower to about 200°C. The preferred reaction temperature employed in a given process will of course be dependent upon the particular olefmic starting material and optically active metal-Ugand complex catalyst employed as well as the efficiency desired. Lower reaction temperattures may generally tend to favor higher enantiomeric excesses (ee) and branched/normal ratios.  In general, asymmetric hydroformylations at reaction temperatures of about 0°C to about 120°C are preferred for all types of olefinic starting materials. More preferably, alpha-olefins can be effectively hydroformylated at a temperature of &amp;Y}m about O^C to about 90°C while even less reactive olefins tiian conventional linear alpha-olefins and internal olefins as well as mixtures of alpha-olefins and internal olefins are effectively and preferably hydroformylated at a temperature of from about 25°C to about 120*'C. Indeed, in the rhodiiun-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation process of this invention, no substantial benefit is seen in operating at reaction -temperatures much above 120°C and such is considered to be less desirable.<br>
The processes employed in the first step of the process of this invention are conducted for a period of time sufficient to produce an enantiomeric aldehyde mixture. The exact reaction time<br><br>
employed is dependent, in part, upon factors such as temperature, nature and proportion of starting materials, and the like. The reaction time will normally he wilJiin the range of &amp;om about one-half to about 200 hours or more, and preferably from less than about one to about 10 hours.<br>
The asymmetric synthesis processes, preferably asymmetric hydroformylation processes, useful as the first step in the process of this invention can be carried out in either the Uquid or gaseous state and involve a batch, continuous Uquid or gas recycle system or combination of sudi systems. A batch system is preferred for conducting such processes.  Preferably, such asymmetric hydroformylation involves a batch homogeneous catalysis process wherein the hydroformylation is carried out in the presence of both free phosphorus Ugand and any suitable conventional solvent as further described herein.<br>
The asymmetric synthesis processes, and preferably as3anmetric hydroformylation process, useful as the first step in tiie process of tiiis invention may be conducted in the presence of an organic solvent for the optically active metal-Hgand complex catalyst. Depending on the particular catalyst and reactants employed, suitable oirganic solvents include, for example, alcohols, alkanes, alkenes, alkjmes, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids, amides, amines, aromatics and the like. Any suitable solvent which does not imduly adversely interfere with the intended asjnomietric S3nitiiesis process can be employed and such solvents may include those heretofore commonly employed in known metal catalyzed processes. Increasing the dielectric constant or polarity of a solvent may generally tend to favor increased reaction rates and selectivity. Mixttires of one or more different solvents may be employed if desired. The amoimt of solvent employed is not critical to this invention and need only be that amount sufficient to provide the reaction medium with the particular metal, substrate and product<br><br>
concentration desired for a given process. In general, the amount of solvent when employed may range from about 6 percent by weight up to about 95 percent by weight or more based on the total weight of the reaction medium.<br>
As noted above, the metal-ligand-catalyzed asymmeti:ic synthesis processes (and especially the as3rmmetric hydroformylation process) useful as the first step in the process of this invention can be carried out in the presence of free Ugand, i.e., ligand that is not complexed with the metal of tiie optically active metal-Ugand complex catalyst employed. While it is preferred to employ a fi^e ligand that is the same as the ligand of the metal-ligand complex catalyst such ligands need not be the same in a given process, but can be different if desired. While the asymmetiic sjmtheses and preferably asymmetric hydroformylation process may be carried out in any excess amount of free ligand desired, the employment of free ligand may not be absolutely necessary. Accordingly, in general, amounts of ligand of from about 2 to about 100, or higher if desired, moles per mole of metal (e.g., rhodium) present in the reaction mediiun should be suitable for most purposes, particularly with regard to rhodiima catalyzed hydroformylation; said amotmts of ligand employed being the siun of both the amount of ligand that is boxmd (complexed) to the metal present and the amount of free (non-complexed) ligand present. Of course, if desired, make-up ligand can be supplied to the reaction mediimi of the asymmetric hydroformylation process, at any time and in any suitable manner, to maintain a predetermined level of free ligand in the reaction mediiun.<br>
The ability to carry out the processes usefrd as the first step of the process of this invention in the presence of free ligand can be a beneficial aspect of this invention in that it removes the criticality of employing very low precise concentrations of ligand that may be required of certain complex catalysts whose activity may be retarded when even any amoimt of free ligand is also present dtiring the<br><br>
process, particularly when large scale commercial operations are involved, thus helping to provide the operator with greater processing latitude.<br>
As indicated above, the aldehyde-forming processes uBeful in this invention can he conducted in a batch or continuous fashion, vntb. recycle of unconsumed starting materials if required. The reaction can be conducted in a single reaction zone or in a pluraUty of reaction zones, in series or in parallel or it ms^ be conducted batchwise or continuously in an elongated tubular zone or series of such zones. The materials of construction employed should be inert to the starting materials during the reaction and the fabrication of the eqtdpment should be able to withstand the reaction temperatures and pressures. Means to introduce and/or adjust the quantity of starting materials or ingredients introduced batchwise or continuously into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction can be conveniently utihzed in the processes especially to maintain the desired molar ratio of the starting materials. The reaction steps may be effected by the incremental addition of one of the starting materials to the other. Also, the reaction steps can be combined by the joint addition of the starting materials to the optically active metal-Hgand complex catalyst. When complete conversion is not desired or not obtainable, the starting materials can be separated from the product and then receded back into the reaction zone. The processes may be conducted in either glass lined, stainless steel or similar tjrpe reaction equipment. The reaction zone may be fitted with one or more internal and/or external heat exdianger(s) in order to control undue temperature fluctuations, or to prevent any possible "runaway" reaction temperatiures.<br>
The aldehyde-forming processes useful as the first step in the process of this invention are useful for preparing mixtures of substituted optically active aldehydes. The aldehyde-forming processes usefiil in this invention stereoselectively produce a chiral<br><br>
center. Illustrative optically aldehydes prepared by the processes of tibis invention indude, for example, substituted aldehydes, niustx-ative preferred optically active aldehyde compounds prepared by the asymmetric hydroformylation process of this invention include, for example, S-2-(p-isobutylph«iyl)-propionaldehyde, S-2-(6-metho^-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde, S-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionaldehyde, S-2-(p-thienoylphenyl)propionaldehyde, S-2-(3-fluoro-4-phenyl)phenylpropionaldehyde, S-2-[4-(l,3-dihydro-l-oxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl)phenyl]propionaldehyde, S-2-(2-methylacetaldehyde)-5-benzoylthiophene and the like. Illustrative of suitable optically active compounds which can be prepared by the processes of this invention (including derivatives of the optically active compounds as described hereinbelow and also prochiral and chiral starting material compounds as desmbed hereinabove) include those permissible compounds which are described in Kirk-Otimier, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, 1984, tiie pertinent portions of whidi are incorporated herein by reference, and The Merck Index, An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs and Biologicals, Eleventh Edition, 1989, the pertinent portions of whidi are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aldehyde-forming processes useful as the first step in the process of this invention can provide optically active aldehydes having very high enantioselectivity and regioselectivity. Enantiomeric excesses of preferably greater than 50%, more preferably greater than 75% and most preferably greater than 90% can be obtained by sudi processes. Branched/normal molar ratios of preferably greater than 5:1, more preferably greater than 10:1 and most preferably greater than 25:1 can be obtained by such processes.<br>
In the process of this invention, the aldehyde mixtures may be separated fi*om the other components of the crude reaction mixtures in which the aldehyde mixtures are produced by any suitable method. Suitable separation methods include, for example,<br><br>
solvent extraction, crystallization, distillation, vaporization, wiped film evaporation, falling film evaporation and the like. It may be . desired to remove the optically active products fix)m the crude reaction mixture as they are formed through the use of trapping agents as described in published Patient CSooperation Treaty Patent ApplicationWO 88/08835. A preferred method for separating the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures from the other components of the crude reaction mixtures is by membrane separation.  Such membrane separation can be achieved as set out below which for purposes of illustration, relates to the separation of a crude as5mametric hydroformylation reaction mixture.<br>
In membrane separation of a crude hydroformylation reaction product, a hydrophobic solvent-resistant membrane is used which allows the aldehyde mixture, any tmreacted olefin and any solvent to pass through while retaining a substantial portion of the optically active metal-phosphorus ligand complex catalyst and any fi'ee Hgand. A flow diagram of a suitable membrane separation system is shown in Fig. 1. The membrane separation is a pressure-driven process and, typically, the pressure of the feed stream (i.e., the crude reaction product that is being separated) is about 400 to 500 poTinds per square inch, although pressmres as low as 50 poimds per sqtiare inch and as high as 1000 pounds per square inch can be used. The feed stream to the membrane is the crude reaction product comprising an optically active, metal-phosphorus ligand complex catalyst and any fi'ee Ugand dissolved in the aldehyde mixtxu'e, the imreacted olefin and any solvent used in the asymmetric hydroformylation.  The "permeate" is the stream which has parsed throtigh the membrsine, as compared to ihe feed stream, the permeate is at a greatly reduced pressure. Typically, the permeate is near atmospheric pressure. The permeate contains a greatly reduced amount of optically active metal-phosphorus ligand complex catalyst and any fi-ee ligand dissolved in the bulk of the aldehyde, the<br><br>
unreacted olefin and any solvent. The "raffinate" stream (also called the "concentrate" or "non-permeate" stream) is the stream that does not pass through the membrane. The ra£5nate contains the bulk of the optically active metal-phosphorus ligand complex catalyst and any free ligand dissolved in some aldehyde, unreacted olefin and any solvent. The ra£Gnate stream is typically only slightly lower in pressure than the feed stream. The rafOnate stream can be recycled back to the hydroformylation reactor for reuse. The permeate stream can be repressurized if it is desired to remove more of the optically active metal-phosphorus ligand complex catalyst and any free ligand catalyst and sent to another membrane to undergo separation again. Alternatively, the permeate stream can be sent to the next step of the process of this invention (crystallization) if the levels of catalyst and Ugand are acceptably low.<br>
Suitable membranes for the above separations are disclosed in published Eviropean Patent Application 0 532,199 Al.

a.       Solutions<br>
Once the requisite mixture of enantiomeric aldehydes has been provided, the next step of the process of this invention involves crystaUizing the mixture from a solution thereof so as to isolate the desired enantiomer in a purer form.   Suitable solutions can be provided by using liquid aldehydes or by melting solid aldehydes (when melt orystallization is employed). However, suitable solutions usually consist of the aldehydes dissolved in an appropriate solvent (e.g., in the solvent in which the first step of the process of this invention was conducted). Any solvent which will dissolve the aldehyde mixture may he used. Examples of suitable solvents are ketones (e.g., acetone), esters (e.g., ethyl acetate), hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene), nitrohydrocarbons (e.g., nitrobenzene) and ethers [e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF) and glyme]. A mixture of two or more solvents can be employed to maximize the purity and yield of the desired aldehyde. The solution used may also contain materials other present in the crude reaction product of the aldehyde-forming reaction (e.g., catalyst, ligand and heavies). Preferably, however, the solution consists essentially of only the aldehyde mixture and the solvent. The concentration of the aldehyde mixture in the solvent solution wiU be limited by the solubility of the aldehyde mixture in the solvent.<br>
b.        Crystallization Conditions<br>
In the process of this invention the solution containing the enantiomeric aldehyde mixture is maintained tmder conditions such that the solubiUty limit of the desired aldehyde is exceeded. Such conditions include addition of a non-solvent to the. solution, removal of any solvent from the solution and, preferably, cooling the solution (including vacuum cooling the solution). Combinations of these conditions can be used to effect the desired crystallization.<br><br>
With respect to ciystallization by using solvent removal, it should be noted that, if the pressure above the solution is fixed, then adding heat will increase solution temperature until the solution boils. Upon continued addition of heat, solvent will evaporate and the solution will become saturated. At this point, the solution concentration will remain constant (Gibbs Phase Rule) and continued heating will precipitate (taystallize) solute (i.e., the desired aldehyde). Conversely, if the pressure above the saturated solution which exhibits an increase in solubility with increased temperatiire is slowly reduced, tiie temperature of the solution will decrease and cooling will cause precipitation (crystallization) of solute (i.e., the desired aldehyde).<br>
With respect to aystallization by using non-solvent (e.g., water) addition, it should be noted that adding a liquid to the saturated solution that is misdble with the solvent but in whidi the solute has limited solubility will cause the solute (i.e., the desired aldehyde) to precipitate (crystallize). Crystallization using non-solvent addition is a preferred practice of this invention and is demonstrated in Example 10 below.<br>
Although the description of this invention appearing below relates primarily to oystallization by cooling, this invention encompasses any conditions for effecting the desired crystallization, c.        Phase Diagrams<br>
This invention is applicable to the separation of any enantiomeric aldehyde (first aldehyde) fix)m an mixttu'e containing that aldehyde and the corresponding enantiomeric aldehyde, provided tiie mixture is in the compositional region v^ere only the first aldehyde crystallizes on cooling of solution of the mixture.  Suitable mixtures include mixtures of conglomerate aldehyde compoimds (illustrated by Fig. 2 which is discussed below) and mixtures of aldehydes that can form racemic compoimds (illustrated by Fig. 3 which is discussed below).<br><br>
When aldehydes being seperated are conglomerates, the crystallization phenomenon that occurs in the practice of this invention is generally governed by the factors illustrated in Fig. 2 which is a phase diagram of two substances, X and Y (e.g., enantiomer aldehydes). In Fig. 2, area (i.e., compositional region) I represents a unsaturated solution containing X and Y, area (i.e., compositional region) II corresponds to the coexistence of crystals of substance Y and the saturated solution containing X and Y, area (i.e., compositional region) III represents the coexistence of crystals of substance X and the saturated solution containing X and Y, and area (i.e., compositional region) IV corresponds to mixtures of crystals of substances X and Y.  The curve separating areas (i.e., compositional regions) I and II is the solubility curve for substanc8 Y, while the curve separating areas (i.e., compositional regions) I and III is the curve for phase equibrimi between solid X and the corresponding solution containing X and Y. The curves intersect at point E, where solid X, solid Y and a solution with composition E, that is saturated with both X and Y are in equilibrium. Points tx and ty are the melting points of pure components X and Y, respectively.<br>
If an unsaturated solution containing X and Y (represented by point A in Fig. 2) is cooled, the composition of the solution does not change and the point representing the cooling solution therefore moves vertically downward on the phase diagram (Fig. 2). With continued cooling, this vertical line intersects the solubility curve at point B, lying on the boundary of the region corresponding to the separation of crystals of substance Y. On still further cooling, crystals of only substance Y separate, the solution is depleted in component Y and hence the composition of the solution moves along the solubility curve from right to left. For example, on cooling the solution down to a temperature corresponding to point C, crystals of composition F and the mother liquor (melt or solution) with a composition corresponding to point D are in equilibrium in the<br><br>
weight ratio CD : CF. On a further decrease in temperature, the point representing the liquid phase (solution) moves along the solubility curve towards point E. Finally, at a temperature corresponding to point G, crystals of H are in equilibrium with a solution of composition E. Solution E is saturated with both components, so that the crystals of both components will separate from a liquid phase (solution) with a constant composition at constant temperature  te on further removal of heat. Temperature te is thus the lowest temperature at which crystals of a single component can still be obtained from the solution. For initial solution A, the weight ratio of the maximum obtainable amount of crystals of Y to mother liquor E is given by the ratio of segments EG : GH. Point E is called the eutectic point, temperature tE is the eutectic temperatiire and the mixture of substances X and Y with composition correspondmg to point E is a eutectic mixttire.<br>
Fig. 3 is a melting point diagram (or phase diagram) of enantiomers that can form a racemic compound.  The shape of such diagram can vary within rather large limits depending upon whether the racemic compotmd melting point is greater, lower, or equal to that of the enantiomers. In Fig. 3, tR represents a racemic compound having a melting point that is lower than ty (or tx), which is the melting point of the pure optically active substance. The eutectic Ey (or Ex consists of a mixture of crystalline Y (or X) and racemic compoimd R.<br>
If a solution of X and Y having composition A in Fig. 3 is cooled to B, pure crystalline Y will begin to form. As the solution  of composition B is cooled further, the composition of the solution follows the path from B to D to EY while continuing to form ptire • crystalline Y.  Upon reaching solution composition Ey a mixture of crystalline pure Y and crystalline racemic compoimd R forms thereby limiting possibihty of additional recovery of pure Y.<br><br>
Similarly, crystals of only X can be obtained by cooling solutions in area V (i.e., compositional region V).<br>
If point K in Fig. 3 represents the initial solution composition, then cooling the solution to L initiates formation of racemic ciystalline compound R.  Upon Further coohng, the solution composition follows the path L to N to Ey while continuing to form crystalline racemic compoiind R.  Upon reaching composition Ey, a mixture of crystalline pure Y and crystalline racemic compound R forms. Thus, if K represents the initial solution compositipn, piire crystalline Y can not be obtained by cooling.<br>
Thus, Areas II and V in Fig. 3 illustrate compositional regions in which the process of this invention can be practiced to produce relatively pure X (area V) or relatively p\are Y (area II).<br>
Although Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 have been disclosed above in terms of crystallizalion achieved by cooling, tiie phase relationships shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are also appUcable to crystalhzation achieved by any other means.<br>
d.       Compositional Region<br>
Initially, the appropriate concentration of the aldehydes in the solution (i.e., concentration in tiie region where only the desired enantiomer crystallizes) can be adaieved by controlling the above-described asjonmetric syntiieses, particularly by the proper selection of the chiral ligand used in the syntheses. By way of illustration, the following ligands have resulted in aldehyde mixtiures in the desired compositional region when used in rhodiimi-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation of 6-methbxy-2-vinylnaphthalene to produce the aldehyde precursor for S-naproxen (S-2-(6-methoxy-^-naphthyDpropionaldehyde):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
*   Ratio of branched isomer to normal isomer. ** Enantiomeric excess.<br>
The above hydroformylation reaction conditions were: 25°C, 130 psi, 1:1 H2/CO, 300 ppm Rh, 2:1 hgand/Rh ratio and an acetone solvent.<br>
The second step of the process of this invention (crystallization) is conducted using solutions containing non-eutectic aldehyde mixtures in the compositional region where only the desired aldehyde is obtained by crystallization. During crystallization by cooling, the relative concentration of the enantiomeric aldehydes, the uniformity of solution temperature, the cooling rate and the cooling temperature are controlled so that the concentration of the aldehydes remains in the region where only the desired enantiomer crystallizes. Thus, with reference to Fig. 1, in order to crystallize only component Y, the relative concentration of the enantiomers must be controlled to be to the right of eutectic concentration (E)r During the crystallization (when the concentration of Y in the solution shifts to the left on the solubility curve toward the eutectic concentration, E), the appropriate concentration is maintained by stopping crystallization before the eutectic concentration and/or temperature are reached.<br><br>
The enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures useful in the process of this invention can have any composition other than the. composition at which the mixture is eutectic (i.e., the mixtures are non-eutectic), provided the composition is in the region where only the desired aldehyde crystallizes on cooling the mixture. The reason for the requirement of using non-eutectic mixtures is that unacceptably large amounts of the undesired enantiomer usually crystallize from eutectic mixtures.<br>
e.	Crystallization Temperature<br>
In the preferred practice of the process of this invention, solutions containing the enantiomeric aldehyde mixtures are cooled to effect crystallization of the desired enantiomer. Higher crystaUization temperattires promote the formation of desirably l£irger crystals but increase the possibiHIy of undesirable racemization. The temperature of the solution can be raised slightiy after the crystals initially form to a temperature just below the initial crystallization temperature and then the temperature can be lowered again. This technique causes the smaller oystals to redissolve and the larger aystals to grow still larger with the result that better generation of the crystals from the solution is achieved. Crystallization temperature wiU effect both product purity and jdeld in that lower temperatures produce higher yields. Vacuiun cooling is a preferred practice of this invention and is demonstrated in Example 11 below.<br>
f.	Grvstallization In Stages<br>
In the preferred practice of the process of this invention, the crystallization can, if desired, be conducted by cooling in stages. That is, the initial solution of the aldehyde mixture can cooled to a temperature at which the desired aldehyde crystallizes and held at that temperattire until crystallization is com^plete. Then the crystals can be filtered from the remaining solution to produce a filtrate and the filtrate can be again cooled to crystallize additional<br><br>
amounts of the desired aldehyde. The cooling-ctystaUization-filtration-cooling sequence can be repeated as often as desired, provided the eutectic composition and temperature are not reached. The advantage of operating in stages is increased yield of the desired aldehyde.   It is desirable to remove some of the solvent between eadi cooling stage.<br>
g.        Crystallization Apparatus<br>
In the practice of this invention, the crystaUization of the desired enantiomeric aldehyde can be adueved using any convenient apparatus. The preferred apparatus is a falling film crystallizer such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,621,664 and that apparatus contains vertical (usually metaUic) wall surfaces which are cooled from the opposite wall siurface. When the. Hquid phase (i.e., the solution of the aldehyde mixture) flows as a much smaller stream-like film that is spread over the area of the wall, the separation is superior to that obtained when the liqmd phase fills the entire cross section of the means, such as a pipe, down which it flows, the wetted circumference and tiie quantity of flow for the one case being equal to those of the other. The reason for this is that in the case of the film the flow is turbulent, whereas in the other case, for a given example, the flow has a Resnoolds Number of 1600, indicating a laminar flow. The turbulent flow in tiie falling film has a laminar bomidary layer a few tenths of a millimeter thick where mass transfer occurs by molecular difiEusion, whereas this boundary layer for a completely laminar flow is approximately ten millimeters thick. The equation for the actual distribution coefELdent, reproduced in "Background of the Invention" in U.S. Patent 3,621,664, shows that a distribution coefELdent approaching the best possible value is obtainable with film flow, when the crystaUization rate is on the order of one centimeter per hour, as would be required in a large scale operations and, when the tnolecular difliision coefi&amp;dent in the hquid phase is on the order of 10-5 centimeters^/second; whereas in the<br><br>
other case the distribution coefficient is dose to one, indicating virtually no separation. If good separation is wanted in the other case, the Resmolds Number must be raised, which necessitates a larger flow and greater power consimiption, particularly with viscous liquids, rendering operation tmeconomical.<br>
Good separation of the desired enantiomeric aldehyde during crystallization occurs in the apparatus of U.S. Patent 3,621,664 even in the laminar region, provided that the waves appearing on the film surface cause a mixing action. Here also the layer thickness is only a few tenths of a millimeter and separation is correspondingly good. The quantity of liquid processed and the power consouned by the circulation pump are relatively little. The cooled vertical walls of the crystallizer are, in a preferred embodiment, in the form of tube bundles having any desired number of vertical, parallel tubes, the liquid being introduced at the tops of the tubes by a distributor to flow down the tubes iimer siufaces as a film, and the cooling medium filling the jadcet smrounding ihe tubes. The lower end of the oystallizer incorporates a tank for collecting the Uqpiid phase.<br>
The desired aldehyde crystals usually form on the inner surface of the falling film crystallizer. The crystals are removed by dissolving the crystals in a solvent (e.g., acetone) at a temperature below the melting point of the desired crystals to avoid substantial racemization of the desired crystals.<br>
Two other arrangements of the apparatus of U.S. Patent 3,621,664 can be used for crystallization in accordance with this invention on an industrial scale.  In one arrangement, crystalHzation occurs on the outer surfaces of a heat exdianger composed of a bimdle of thin, parallel tubes, with baffle plates causing a strong oross flow of the liquid phase. In the other arrangement, the crystals Term on the outer surface of a horizontal pipe grid, the liquid phase flowing down over the grid. In both<br><br>
arrangements, the cross flow about the pipes causes a turbulence producing a general mixing action, the laminar boundary layer at each pipe being then very thin. Similar results are obtained witii cooled or, for some applications, heated short fins or bafEle plates positioned in the flow to give a pronounced cross flow.<br>
The separation in the preferred crystallization apparatus may be improved during crystallization by periodically briefly heating (or cooling, in certain applications) the fluid phase before it enters the crystalUzer. This measure yields a smooth crystal surface and avoids dendritic or xmeven crystal growth with the attendant undesirable trapping of mother liquid within the crystal layer.<br>
Crystallization in the above-mentioned preferred crystallization apparatus is convenientiy carried out in a single apparatus in such a mamier that single crystallizations are cyclically repeated, beginning with the step of the highest concentration of impiuity or impurities and advancing to the step of the desired component in its purest form, llie small amount of mother liquor (i.e., solution of the aldehyde mixture) held on the surfaces of the crystaUizer only slightly contaminates the crystallization of the succeeding step and going from the "purest" step to the "least pure" step, when ending one (^de and starting another, does not influence the separation.<br>
The oystaUization process can be conducted in the preferred crystalHzation apparatus in an inert atmosphere. The crystals of the final step can be fiiither purified by distillation or partial melting and the less pure separated substance returned to the finsd step.  The surface on which crystallization occiu:s can be cooled by flowing a heat exchange meditun, in the form of a film, over the opposite surface of the aystallizer wall. This surface can be vertical, horizontal, or at any angle^therebetween.<br><br>
h.       Product Purity<br>
The crystals of the desired enantiomeric aldehyde produced by the process of this invention contain considerably less of the other enantiomeric aldehyde than is contained the starting liquid aldehyde mixture. However, some of the other aldehyde may be present in the crystals due to occlusion, incomplete draining or entrainment of the solution from which the oystals are formed. Thus, the process of this invention provides optically active aldehydes having very high enantioselectivities and very high regioselectivities. With respect to enantioselectivity, enantiomeric excesses of preferably greater than 96%, and more preferably greater than 99%, can be obtained by the process of tiiis invention. With respect to regioselectivity, branched/normal molar ratios of preferably greater than 100:1, more preferably greater than 200:1 and most preferably greater than 1000:1, can be obtained by the process of this invention. In addition, the desired aldehydes are relatively free of any residual metal catalyst (e.g., rhodiima) used in the production of the starting aldehyde mixture, especially when the above-described membrane separation is employed. Thus, if the initial aldehyde solution contains substantial amounts of metal catalyst (e.g., 300 parts per million of rhodium), the desired aldehydes can contain less than 20 parts per million by weight of residual metal catalyst (e.g., rhodium) when crystallization without membrane separation is used. The desired aldehydes can contain less than 2 parts per million by weight of residual metal catalyst (e.g., rhodium) when membrane separation followed by crystallization is used.<br>

Example 1<br>
Improving- Enantiomeric Purity of an Aldehyde<br>
Through Crystallization in Acetone<br>
A solution consisting of 6-metho^-2-vinyinaphthalene (395 g), Iso(BHA-P)2-2R,4R-pentanediol (6.041 g), Rh4(CO)i2 0.862 g) and acetone (1500 mL) was charged to a 1 gallon reactor which was pressurized to 250 psi with 1:1 H2/CO. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for four days to effect hydroformylation. The crude reaction product so produced was removed from the reactor and an aliquot removed to determine the composition of the product.<br>
GrC analysis of the aliquot of the crude reaction product indicated that 98.8% of the olefin starting material had been converted to aldehydes and that a 95:1 ratio of 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyDpropionaldehyde to 3-(6-metho3gr-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde had been obtained. Oxidation of the aldehydes in the aliquot followed by chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the resulting carboxylic adds indicated that an 81% ee of the desired S-aldehyde [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde] was produced.<br>
The above-mentioned oxidation and HPLC analysis were conducted as follows: 3 mL of the crude reaction product was diluted in 50 mL of acetone and mixed with 0.3 g of potassium permanganate and 0.32 g of magnesinm sulfate. The mixture so formed was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes to effect oxidation of the aldehydes in the crude reaction product to the corresponding carboxylic adds. Then the acetone was removed under reduced pressure. The residue so produced was extracted three times with 50 mL of hot water and the three aqueous solutions so obtained were . combined, filtered and washed with 50 mL of chloroform. The aqueous layer was then addified with HCl to a pH of 2 at which time a white, solid predpitate formed. The predpitate was filtered,<br><br>
washed with water and dried to isolate the carboxylic adds. The carboxylic adds were analyzed by diiral HPLC on a CHIRACEL™ OD-H column which could separate the two enantiomers of the resulting 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic add.<br>
The remainder of the crude reaction product was stored at -22°C overnight and during that time crystals formed. These crystals were filtered, washed with cold acetone and dried under vacuum to yield 111 g of off-white crystals and a first filtrate. Analysis of the crystals indicated that the b/n isomer ratio had been increased to &gt;250:1. Oxidation of the aldehydes to carboxylic adds and chiral HPLC of the resulting carboxyhc adds indicated a 93% ee of the S-enantiomer had been obtained.<br>
The first filtrate was stored overnight at -22°C and additional crystals formed. These crystals were filtered, washed with cold acetone and dried under vacuum to jdeld a second filtrate and<br>
70 g of white oystals with an b/n isomer ratio of 250:1 and a 93% ee of the S-enantiomer.<br>
The second filtrate was stored at -22°C overnight and again crystals formed.  Filtration, washing and vacutmi drying of these crystals resulted in isolation of 50 g of a crystalline aldehyde product having an b/n isomer ratio of 200:1 and an ee of 92% S-enantiomer.<br>

Through Crvstallization in Ethvl Acetate	^<br>
A solution consisting of 6-methoxy-2-vinylnaphthalene<br>
(60 g), Iso(BHA-P)2-2R,4R-pentanediol (1.25 g), Rh4(CO)i2 (0.131 g)<br>
and ethyl acetate (180 g) was charged to a 300 mL reactor which was<br>
pressurized to 250 psi with 1:1 H2/CO. The reaction mixture so<br>
formed was stirred at ambient temperature for four days to effect<br><br>
hydroformylation. The crude reaction product was removed from the reactor and an aliquot removed to determine the composition of the product.<br>
GrC analsrsis of the aliquot indicated that 99% of the olefin starting material had been converted to aldehydes and that a 59:1 ratio of 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde to 3-(6-metho^-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde had been obtained. Oxidation of the aldehyde products followed by dairal HPLC analysis of the resulting carboxylic acids indicated that an 80% ee of the desired S-aldehyde [i.e., S-2-(6-niethoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde] was produced.<br>
The remainder of the crude reaction product was then stored at -22°C overnight, dtiring which time crystals formed in the container. These crystals were filtered, washed with cold acetone and dried under vacumn to yield 32 g of off white crystals. Subsequent analysis of these oystals indicated that the b/n isomer ratio had been increased to &gt;129:1. Oxidation of the crystalline aldehyde and chiral HPLC of the restdting carboxylic add indicated a 92% ee of the S-enantiomer had been obtained.<br>
Example 3<br>
Membrane Separation of An Aldehyde from Acetone Solution<br>
A.      A crude hydroformylation reaction product similar to the crude reaction product produced in Example 1 above was processed through a membrane to remove the rhodium and ligand. The crude reaction product contained 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde (30 wt%) dissolved in acetone (70 wt%)C. The crude reaction product also contained rhodium (263.3 ppm) and ligand.<br>
The membrane and associated equipment is shown in Fig. 4. The membrane was arranged and used as follows: Three 2 inch circles were cut from an 8 inch xll inch sheet of MPF-50<br><br>
membranes (Lot #021192, code 5107) which are sold by Membrane Products Kiryat Weizmann Ltd. and which are bdieved to be within the scope of above-mentioned European Patent Application 0 532,199 Al. These circles were placed into three Osmonics membrane holders. The crude reaction product (feed) was placed into a 2L Hoke cylinder under nitrogen. The feed was pumped to 500 psi at a flow rate of about 380 ml/min. The feed flowed through a 60 micron filter and then was split into three streams which went to the membranes. Flowmeters were used to ensure that the flow was split equally to the holders.  The permeate from the membranes was combined and collected under nitrogen. The raffinate flowed to a back pressure regulator and was then returned to the Hoke cylinder.<br>
About 1500 g of the crude reaction product was permeated and the rhodium content of the resulting first permeate was about 69.4 ppm. The membrane and equipment were washed with acetone and the acetone was discarded.<br>
The above-described membrane separation was repeated on the 1500 g of the first permeate (which contained 69.4 ppm rhodium) and 1000 g of a solution (containing 19.2 ppm rhodium) was separated as a second permeate. The composition of the second permeate was 80% acetone and 20% solids. The b/n isomer ratio of the solids was 64:1 and it contained 1.4% normal isomer, 9.9% R-isomer, and 88.7% S-isomer [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde]. The enantiomeric excess (ee) of the crystalline soHds was 80.7%. The second permeate so obtained was then concentrated and crystalUzed as described below.<br>
A portion of the second permeate produced as descfibed above was concentrated by evaporating acetone at IS^C and 25 inches of mercury pressure to produce a concentrated solution containing 70% acetone and 30% solids. The concentrate so obtained was charged into the crystallizer shown in Fig. 5. The crystallizer consisted of a jacketed, 250 cc vertical cylinder (A) fitted with a stirrer<br><br>
(B) and an internal filter (C). Crystallization was initiated by cooling the jacket to -14'C thus cooling l^e contents of the cylinder to near -14°C. In ord6r to dissolve the small crystals that formed on the inner surface of the pylinder and to enhance oystal size, the crystallizer was reheated to 3°C and again cooled to -14°C using cooler (D). This procedure was repeated three tames. Since the internal filter (C) dogged, the solid crystals formed in the cylinder and liquid were removed fi'om the crystallizer and separated in a laboratory vacuum filter. The resulting filter cake was washed with one part by weight of cold acetone (0°C) per two parts (by weight) of wet solids (filter cake). The restiltant crystalline filter cake contained 13% acetone and 87% <a solids and had a b isomer ratio of the contained normal rrisomer s-isomer. enantiomeric excess was scanning electron microscope photos indicated that solid particles were uniform about microns in size.></a>
B.	The concentration and crystaUization procedure<br>
of A above was repeated with another portion of the second permeate<br>
obtained in the above-described membrane separation and the<br>
crystals produced had a b/n isomer ratio of 446:1 and contained of<br>
0.2% normal isomer, 2.7% R-isomer, and 97.1% S-isomer. The ee of<br>
the crystals was 94.6%.<br>
C.	The wet filter cakes produced via the procedures<br>
of A and B above were combined and dissolved in two parts by weight<br>
of acetone per part by weight of the combined wet filter cake. The<br>
solution so obtained was crystallized using the crystaUization<br>
procedure of A above, separated and washed per tiie procediure of A<br>
above. The resultant crystals had a b/n isomer ratio of 921:1 and<br>
contained 0.1 normal isomer, 1.3% R-isomer, and 98.6% S-isomer!<br>
The ee of the crystals was 97.4%.<br>
D.	The wet crystalline filter cake produced by<br>
procedure of C above was dissolved in two parts (by weight) of acetone<br><br>
per part of the combined wet cake and crystallized using the crystallization procedure of A above, separated and washed according to the procedure of A above. The final crystals so obtained had a b/n isomer ratio of 1836:1. The crystal contained 0.05% normal isomer, .6% E-isomer, 99.35% S-isomer and 4 ppm rhodium. The ee of the crystals was 98.8%. The melting point of the crystals was 72.5°C determined in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC).<br>
Refining An Aldehyde from Ethyl Acetate Solution<br>
A.	A crude hydroformylation reaction product was<br>
used that was similar to the crude reaction product produced in<br>
Example 2 above and that was composed of 62.9% ethyl acetate and<br>
37,1% soUds containing 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde.<br>
The soUds had a b/n of 42:1 were composed of 2.3% normal isomer,<br>
11.7% R-isomer and 86% S-isomer [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-<br>
propionaldehyde] and had an ee of 76%. The anide reaction product<br>
was crystallized as follows:<br>
B.	Seven successive 250 cc charges of the crude<br>
reaction product were cooled to -7°C in the crystalHzer used in<br>
Example 3 above (see Fig. 5). The crystals and liquid resulting from<br>
the crystaUization were separated on an external vacutun filter and<br>
the o^stals were washed with 0.5 parts of ethyl acetate per part of<br>
wet cake. The resultant composite cake from the seven<br>
crystaUizalions contained 24% ethyl acetate and 76% crystalline<br>
sohds. The b/n isomer ratio of the crystalline solids was 123:1 and the<br>
soHds contained .8% normal isomer, 6.0% R-isomer, and 93.2%^-<br>
isomer. The ee of the crystalline soUds was 87.9%.<br>
C.	The wet filter cake from step B. above was<br>
dissolved in two parts by weight of ethyl acetate per part (by weight) of<br>
wet filter cake. The solution was cooled to -13°C in the laboratory<br>
crystalHzer (Fig. 5). The contents of the crystaUizer were then<br><br>
reheated to 3oC and again cooled to -130. This cool-reheat cycle was repeated two times to enhance the oystal size. The solid-liquid mixture so produced was separated in an external vacuum filter and the wet filter cake 50 produced was washed with 0.5 parts of cold (-10oC) ethyl acetate per part of wet filter cake. The resultant cake contained 25% ethyl acetate and 75% OTstalline solids. The crystalline solids had a b/n isomer ratio of 483:1 and had, a nozmal isomer content of .2%, a K-isomer content of 1.6% and a S-isomer content of 98.2%. The ee of the crystalline solids was 96.8%.<br>
Example 5 fiefining of An Aldehyde from Acetone Solution in a Falling Film Crystallizer<br>
Crude hydroformylation reaction product that was similar to the crude reaction product produced in Example 1 above and that contained 70% acetone and 30% solids was refined in a laboratory falling film crystallizer. The soHds in the crude reaction product had a b/n isomer ratio of 69:1 and tiie solids composition was 1.4% normal isomer, 8.9% R-isomer, and 89.7% S-isomer [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde].  The enantiomeric excess of the solids was 81.9%.<br>
The crude reaction product was concentrated by evaporating 30% by weight of the solution. The resulting concentrate consisted of 57% acetone and 43% soUds. This was crystallized in a laboratory falling film crystallizer by the following procediure.<br>
The crystallizer used is shown in Fig. 6 and consisted of a kettie (A), a jacketed colunm (B) {the colmnn was a one meter fong jacketed vertical tube having a one inch diameter internal opening} and (D) means for pumping (i.e., circulating) liquid from the kettie to the film device (C) at the top of the falling film CTystallizer. The jacket of the crystallizer was affixed to a supply of coolant (E) whidi flowed co-ctirrent with the falling film, That is, both the falling film<br><br>
and the coolant in the jacket flowed downward in a co-current fashion. The crystallizer shown in Fig. 6 is similar in principle of operation to those described in above-mentioned U.S. Patent 3,621,664.<br>
Two thousand milliliters of the concentrate produced as      -described above were charged to the kettle (A) of the falling film crystallizer (Fig. 6). The concentrate in the kettle was circulated briefly down through the column (B) to wet the inside walls and then circulation was discontinued. Since the walls of the column were maintained at -20°C by circulating coolant, a thin frosting of solids quickly formed on the inner walls of the column.  The flow through the falling film crystallizer was resumed depositing crystals on the inside of column wall. After the kettie temperature was reduced to -16°C, the recirculation flow was stopped. During the cooling, a slight amount of heat was added to the kettie by a heating mantle (F) to prevent crystallization in the kettle. To compensate for this heating, the recirculating liquid was cooled slightiy by circulating coolant from bath (G) to coolers (H). After crystallization was complete, the residual liquid in the kettie was emptied and the solids inside the crystallizer walls were washed with 50 cc of wash hquid that was added from the top of the column and this wash liquid was discarded. The composition of the kettle residue was 61% acetone and 39% solids. The solids in the kettie had a b/n isomer ratio of 60:1 and contained 1.6% normal isomer, 12.8% R-isomer and 86.6% S-isomer. The ee of the kettie solids was 74.0%.<br>
600 CC of reagant grade acetone was added to the kettle and drculated to the falling film device at 20°C and then down the inside wall of the column to dissolve the solids adhering to the iniide of the colunm. This was a very quick and efficient technique for recovering adhering solids and is a unique method for recovery of solids from the falling film crystallizer.  In the prior art, the internal film of crystals in such crystallizers is normally melted (see above-mentioned U.S. Patent 3,621,664). However, this invention is<br><br>
designed to increase the amount of the desired enantiomeric aldehyde (in this Example, the S-isomer) and melting is not feasible since the S-isomer will quickly racemize at its melting point (72.5°C) and so the ee of the crystals will deteriorate.<br>
The acetone solution recovered from the column wall contained 78% acetone and 22% crystalline soHds. The (xystalline solids had a b/n isomer ratio of 111:1 and contained 0.9% normal isomer, 6.9% R-isomer and 92.2% S-isomer. The crystaUine soHds ee was 86.1%.<br>
Example 6 Refining of An Aldehvde from Acetone Solution Utilizing Cooling<br>
Crystallization Three 2 inch circles from an 8.5 inch x 11 inch sheet of MPF-50 membranes (LOT #021192 code 5102). These were placed into three Osmonics membrane holders. Feed was placed into a 2L Hoke cylinder under nitrogen in equipment arranged as shown in Fig. 4. The feed was pumped to 500 psi at a flow rate of about 380 mL/min. The feed flowed through a 60 micron filter and then was spUt into three streams which went to the membranes. Flowmeters were used to ensiu*e that the flow was split equally. The permeate from the membranes was combined and collected under nitrogen.  The rafEinate flowed to a back pressure regulator and then was rettimed to the Hoke cylinder.<br>
The feed was a 4 L batch of a crude hydroformylation reaction product containing 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehydes (30 wt%) in acetone (70 wt%). The mixture also contained rhodium (389.3 ppm) and Iso(BHA-P)2-2R,4R-pentanediol. About 3325 g of this solution was permeated through the membrane and the resulting permeate solution had a rhodium content about 36.3 ppm. The system was emptied, cleaned with acetone and the waste discarded.<br><br>
The 3325 g of the permeate solution contaimng 36.3 ppm rhodium was placed back into the Hoke cylinder and about 1439 g of this solution was again permeated through the membrane. The resulting permeate solution contained about 5.6 ppm rhodium.<br>
The 1439 g of the solution containing 5.6 ppm rhodium was placed back into the Hoke cylinder and passed back through the membrane for the third time. About 935 g of tbis solution was permeated through the membrane and the resulting permeate had about 1.2 ppm rhodium. This permeate was then used as a feed for the crystallization process described below.<br>
Recovery and refining of S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde aldehyde from the permeate obtained as described above was accomplished by the sequence of operations depicted in Fig. 11. In simMnary, the permeate feed solution was batch crystallized by cooling to - 10°C. The slurry so obtained was filtered to remove crystals and the crystals were washed with one half gram of acetone per gram of wet solids. The filtrate and was were combined and the solution concentrated to 40 percent soUds by evaporating acetone. The crystallization, filtration and washing was repeated on this concentrated solution. The crystals fix)m this second stage were combined with crystals fix)m the first oystaUization and dissolved in one and one half parts by weight of acetone per part of wet soUds. This solution was processed in the same manner as the original permeate feed solution. The solids that were recovered and washed from both crystaUization stages were again combined and dissolved in acetone. The final recrystaUization was also conducted in the manner as described above in this Example. The refined aystalline solids from this last stage represented tiie final product (i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde). The final ee was 96.8. The yield of S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde as a fraction of that supplied in the feed was 26.8 percent.<br><br>
A.       Naproxen Aldehyde Melting Point Diagram<br>
Fig. 7 is a melting point diagram for naproxen aldehyde enantiomers [i.e., R- and S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde]. The liquidus curves in Fig. 7 were calculated using the Schore-Van Laar equation [see Jacques, J., A. Collet, and S.H. Wilen, "Enantiomers,Racemates, and Resolutions"; Kriegar (1991) p. 46] using 74°C as the melting point of the pure isomers and 5630.4 calories per gram mole for the enthalpy of fusion. The assumptions in the Schroder-Van Laar equation include immiscibility of enantiomers in the solid state and ideality of the enantiomer mixtxure in the liquid state.<br>
Experimental data was obtained using the crystallizer shown in Fig. 5 and is indicated in Fig. 7 as circles. Samples were obtained during crystaUization tests in acetone solutions. The solid samples were removed from the slurry by filtration. The samples were then slowly heated in a Perkin/Elmer DSC7 to obtain the melting point. The data on Fig. 7 are tabulated on Table 1.<br>
The melting point of pure S enantiomer (S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde) is discernible. It is difficult to develop a complete liquidus curve for a variety of reasons. A problem with melting point determination of such solid samples is that N isomer is present in sufficient concentration to depress the mixture melting point.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
If K is greater than 1, then the crystalHzed sbhds are enhanced in that component. If K is less than 1 then the crystallized solids are depleted of the particular component.<br>
Experimental data shown that the distribution coefficient for S-aldehyde, (Ks), is greater than 1 for the solution concentration range tested. Experimental evidence shows that S-aldehyde is enhanced by crystallization from acetone solutions ranging from 54 to 98.6% S isomer (i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde). Also there is experimental evidence that verifies that R and N isomers are preferentially excluded via crystallization in the S solution range between 54 and 98.6%.<br>
There is some evidence that the S and R isomers form a solid solution in the high purity S isomer range. Although the Ks factor is greater than one, the stage efficiency is only 50% at the high purity end versus 80% or better in the middle range.<br>
In the low S isomer region, the 54% S isomer residue liquid solidified after concentrating and cooling. It may be possible to squeeze a little more S isomer out of solution but 50% S is probably a lower limit on residue concentration via crystallization technology.<br>
Fig. 9 also includes data from a single falling film crystallizer experiment conducted in the crystallizer shown in Fig. 6. Sufficient data were generated to show that the falling film crystallization was effective in upgrading the ee of the desired aldehyde. Distribution coefficients for falling film crystallization using the crystallizer of Fig. 6 are similar in magnitude to results obtained using the crystaUizer of Fig. 5.<br>

Example 8<br>
Recoverv of S-Naproxen Aldehvde from Acetone Solution<br>
A crude reaction product of an asymetric<br>
hydroformylation reaction was produced with low ee (62%) to<br>
experimentally investigate the quality of S-naproxen aldehyde [i.e., S-<br><br>
2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propoinaldehyde] that can be recovered from solutions with high concentrations of corresponding isomeric R- and N-aldehydes. Using the cooling crystallization procedure described in Example 3 above (i.e., the solution is cooled to -15°C, reheated to 0°C and tins technique repeated three times before a final cool down to minus 15), a feed solution containing 77.6% S-isomer, 18.2% R-isomer and 4.2% N-isomer and having an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 62% was processed. The resulting crystals were recovered on a vacum filter and washed with cold acetone. The composition of the crystals was 95.5% S-isomer, 4.0% R-isomer, and 0.5% N-isomer giving an enantiomeric excess of 92%. The filtrate recovered firom the crystallization procedure described above in this Example and having a solids concentration of 65.5% S-isomer, 26.8% R-isomer and 7.7% N-isomer was concentrated to 53% solids by evaporating acetone under vacuum. The concentrate so obtained was crystallized using the crystallization procedure described above in this Example. The composition of the crystalline solids obtained by the latter crystallization was 92.3% S-isomer, 7.0% R-isomer and 0.7% N-isomer.   The enantiomeric excess of those solids was 85.9%. The composition of the soUds in the final filtrate was 54.1% S-isomer, 37.6% R-isomer and 8.3% N-isomer.<br>
Example  9 Improving Enantiomeric Pttritv of 2-(p-Isobutvlphenyl)propionaldehvde Through Melt Crvstallization A solution was prepared consisting of p-isobutylstyrene (100.2 g), Iso(BHA-P)2-2R,4Rrpentanediol (0.85 g), and Rh4(C0)i2 (0.091 g). 100 mL of the mixture so formed was charged to a 300 mL reactor which was pressurized with 1:1 H2/CO.  The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 46 hors at 130 psi to effect hydroformylation. The crude reaction product was removed firom the reactor and an aliquot removed to determine the composition of the product.<br><br>
GrC analysis on a beta-pydodextrin chiral capillary column (Cydodex-B™) indicated that 99.4% of the olefin starting material had been converted to aldehydes and that a 42:1 ratio of 2-(p-isobutylphenyDpropionaldehyde to 3-(p-isobutylphenyl)propion-aldehyde had been obtained. Oxidation of the aldehyde products followed by chiral gas chromatography of the resulting carboxylic adds indicated that an 85±5 % ee of the desired S-aldehyde [i.e., S-2-(p-isobutylphenyl)propionaldehyde] was produced.<br>
A portion (25 mL, 23.54 g) of the crude product was flash distilled to separate the products from the catalyst. The first cut (12,4 g) was obtained at 89-92°C head temperature at a pressure of 1 mm of Hg. A second cut (9.4 g) was obtained at 83-4°C at 0.6 mm of Hg, and a small eimoimt was left as residue. The second cut was partially fi'ozen and some Hquid (3.27 g) was withdrawn, first with a pipet and then a fiitted glass filter stick with the liquid at -12 to -17°C.<br>
Oxidation of portions of the liquid and crystals with sodium chlorite followed by chiral gas chromatography of the resulting carboxyUc adds indicated 92±1 and 75±2 % ee for the S-aldehyde in the crystals and and liquid respectively. The ratios of the concentrations of other impmities in liquid to their concentrations in the crystals averaged 2.2 and the b/n ratio in the crystals was 54:1.<br>
The oxidation with sodiiun chlorite referred to above was conducted as foUows:<br>
A mixture of 0.28 gram of aldehyde and 2.0 mL of distilled water was cooled to 0°C and stirred. Aqueous sodium sulfamate (3 mL of 1M, adjusted to pH 5 with phosphoric add) and sodium chlorite (0.61 mL of 20%) solutions were added. After 15^ minutes, the cooling bath was removed and the solution was stirred for an additional 15 minutes as it was allowed to warm to room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 9.5 with 0.5 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide and the material rinsed with water into a separatory funnel. The solution was shaken with added dichloromethane (10<br><br>
mil) to extract neutral compounds. The aqueous layer was separated and addified to pH
Example 10 Refining of An Aldehvde from Acetone Solution Utilizing Cooling CrvRt^llization and Non-Solvent Addition Crude hydroformylation reaction product (47 g) that was similar to the crude reaction product produced in Example 1 above and that contained 70.5 g of acetone was partially refined in a laboratory crystallizer in a manner similar to Example 6. The solids in the partially refined reaction product had 97.65% S-isomer [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde]. The partially refined product was firrther predpitated by adding non-solvent (water) at the final arystallizer condition. The quantity of water added was 0.5 CC per CC of crystallized slurry. The quality of the S-isomer recovered after vacuum filtration and washing with 150 CC of water was 97.87%. The quantity of material recovered was 40 g. By repeating this procedure four times, product quality increased to 99.10% ( 98.2% ee) with a recovery of 28 g.<br><br>
Refining of An Aldehyde from Acetone Solution Utilizing Vacuum<br>
Cooling Crude hydroformylation reaction product (666 g) that was similar to the crude reaction product produced in Example 1 above and that contained 40% acetone and 60% solids was added to a crystallization apparatus designed to provide vacuum cooling as described below. The solids had a b/n ratio (2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde to 3-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-propionaldehyde) of 82.76:1 and a 76% ee of the S-isomer [i.e., S-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionaldehyde]. The apparatus consisted of a jacketed one liter kettle equipped with stirrer, condenser and vacuum pump. The solution was cooled to 5oC, where crystals formed, and then to 0°C by slowly reducing the vacuum to a final reading of 50 mm absolute.   The contents of the kettle were maintained at 0°C for 15 minutes and then heated to 8°C by increasing system pressure to 150mm and warming the kettle jacket to 10°C to heat the contents. Conditions in the kettle were maintained at 8oC for 10 minutes, vacutmi was again reduced to 50 mm and the kettle temperature reduced to 0°C. This heat back technique was employed to dissolve fine crystals and re-deposit the supersaturation onto existing crystals thereby enhancing the crystal size. After maintaining kettle temperature at 0°C for 10 minutes the contents were separated in a laboratory centrifugal filter and washed with cold acetone. About 60 g of dry solids were recovered with a b/n ratio of 440:1 and an ee of 92.3%.<br>
Although the invention has been illustrated by        ' certain of the preceding examples, it is not to be construed as being limited thereby; but rather, the invention encompasses the generic area as hereinbefore disclosed.  Various modifications and embodiments can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br><br><br></td>
