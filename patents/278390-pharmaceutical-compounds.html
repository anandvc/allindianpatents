				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This inyention relates to novel crystaline and salt forms of compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of the heat shock protein Hsp90 and to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by Hsp90 Also provided are novel processes for making the compounds and novel chemical intermediates<br>
Background of the Inyention<br>
In response to cellular stresses including heat, toxins, radiation, infection, inflammation, and oxidants, all cells produce a common set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (Macano &amp; de Macano 2000) Most heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones Chaperones bind and stabilize proteins at intermediate stages of folding and allow proteins to fold to their functional states Hsp90 is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp under normal conditions There are two human isoforms of Hsp90, a major inducible form Hsp90a and minor constitutively expressed form Hsp90p and two other closely related chaperones which are restncted in their intracellular location (Endoplasmic reticulum GP96/GRP94, mitochondrial TRAP1) The term HSP90 as used here includes all these analogues unless stated Hsp90 binds proteins at a late stage of folding and is distinguished from other Hsps in that most of its protein substrates are inyolved in signal transduction Hsp90 has a distinct ATP binding site, including a Bergerat fold characteristic of bacterial gyrase, topoisomerases and histidine kinases It has been shown that ATP bound at the N-terminal pocket of Hsp90 is hydrolysed This ATPase activity results in a conformational change in Hsp90 that is required to enable conformational changes in the client protein<br>
A dimenzation domain and a second ATP binding site, which may regulate ATPase activity, is found near the c-terminus of Hsp90 Dimenzation of Hsp90 appears critical for ATP hydrolysis Activation of Hsp90 is further regulated through interactions with a variety of other chaperone proteins and can be isolated in complex with other chaperones including Hsp70, Hip, Hop, p23, and p50cdc37 Many other co-chaperone proteins have also been demonstrated to bind Hsp90 A simplified model has emerged in which ATP binding to the amino terminal pocket alters Hsp90 conformation to allow association with a multichaperone complex First the client protein is bound to an Hsp70/Hsp40 complex This complex then associates with Hsp90 via Hop When ADP is replaced by ATP, the conformation of Hsp90 is altered, Hop and Hsp70 are released and a different set of co-chaperones is recruited including p50cdc37 and p23 ATP hydrolysis results in the release of these co-chaperones and the client protein from the mature complex    Ansamycin<br>
 <br>
 [antibiotics herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) are ATP binding site inhibitors that block the binding of ATP and prevent conyersion to the mature complex (Grenert et al ,1997 J Biol Chem , 272 23834-23850)<br>
Despite Hsp90 being ubiquitously expressed, GA has a higher binding affinity for Hsp90 denyed from tumour vs normal cell lines (Kamal et al, Nature 2003, 425 407-410) GA also shows more potent cytotoxic activity in tumour cells and is sequestered at higher concentrations within tumours in xenograft mouse models (Brazidec J Med Chem 2004, 47, 3865-3873) Furthermore the ATP-ase activity of Hsp90 is elevated in cancer cells and is an indication of the increased level of stress in these cells Hsp90 gene amplification has also been reported to occur in the later stages of cancer (Jolly and Monmoto JNCI Vol 92, No 19, 1564-1572, 2000)<br>
Increased genetic instability associated with the cancer phenotype leads to an increase in the production of non-native or mutant proteins The ubiquitin pathway also serves to protect the cell from non-native or misfolded proteins, by targeting these proteins for proteasomal degradation Mutant proteins are by their nature not native and therefore have the potential to show structural instability and an increased requirement for the chaperone system   (Giannini et al, Mol Cell Biol 2004, 24(13) 5667-76)<br>
There is some evidence that Hsp90 is found pnmanly within "activated" multichaperone complexes in the tumour cells as opposed to "latent" complexes in normal cells One component of the multichaperone complex is the cdc37 co-chaperone Cdc37 binds Hsp90 at the base of the ATP binding site and could affect the off rates of inhibitors bound to Hsp90 in the "activated" state (Roe et al, Cell 116, (2004), pp 87-98) The client protein bound to the Hsp90-Hsp70 form of the chaperone complex is believed to be more susceptible to ubiquitination and targeting to the proteasome for degradation E3 ubiquitin hgases have been identified with chaperone interacting motifs and one of these (CHIP) was shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (Connell et al, 2001 Xu et al,2002)<br>
Hsp90 client proteins<br>
The number of reported Hsp90 client proteins now exceeds 100 Since many of its client proteins are inyolved in cell signalling proliferation and survival, Hsp90 has received major interest as an oncology target Two groups of client proteins, cell signalling protein kinases and transcription factors, in particular suggest Hsp90 regulation may have potential benefit as an anticancer therapy<br>
Hsp90 protein kinase client proteins implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following<br>
c-Src<br>
Cellular Src (c-Src) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, required for mitogenesis initiated by multiple growth factor receptors, including the receptors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1R), and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGFR) C-Src is also overexpressed and activated in many of the same human carcinomas that overexpress EGFR and ErbB2 Src is also required for the maintenance of normal bone homeostasis through its regulation of osteoclast function<br>
p185erbB2<br>
ErbB2 (Her2/neu) is a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of malignancies including breast, ovarian, prostate, and gastric cancers ErbB2 was originally identified as an oncogene and inhibition of Hsp90 results in the polyubiquitination and degradation of erbB2<br>
Polo mitotic kinase<br>
Polo-like kinases (Plks) are important regulators of cell cycle progression dunng M-phase Plks are inyolved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and in the activation of CDK/cychn complexes     Plk1  regulates tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C     CDK1 activation in turn leads to spindle formation and entry into M phase<br>
Akt (PKB)<br>
Akt is inyolved in pathways that regulate cell growth by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis Hsp90 inhibition by ansamycins results in a reduction in the Akt half life through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation Binding of cdc37 to Hsp90 is also required for the down-regulation of Akt Following ansamycin treatment cancer cells arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle 24 hours after treatment and proceed to apoptosis 24-48 hours later Normal cells also arrest 24 hours after ansamycin treatment, but do not proceed on to apoptosis<br>
c-Raf. B-RAF. Mek<br>
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in approximately 15% of human cancers The three RAF genes are senne/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS<br>
EGFR<br>
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is implicated in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and migration Overexpression of EGFR has been found in many different cancers and activating mutations of its kinase domain appear to be pathogenic in a subset of adenocarcinoams of the lung<br>
Flt3<br>
FMS-hke tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase inyolved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis Flt3 activation also leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAS signal-transduction cascades<br>
c-Met<br>
c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase which binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and regulates both cell motility and cell growth c-met is overexpressed in tumours, including thyroid, stomach, pancreatic and colon cancer HGF is also detected around the tumours, including liver metastases This suggests that c-met and HGF play an important role in inyasion and metastasis<br>
Cdk1.Cdk2.Cdk4.Cdk6<br>
Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 drive the cell cycle The activity of CDKs is regulated by their binding to specific subunits such as cychns, inhibitory and assembly factors The substrate specificity and timing of CDK activities is dictated by their interaction with specific cychns Cdk4/cychn D and Cdk6/cychn D are active in the G1 phase, Cdk2/cychn E and Cdk2/cychn A in S phase, and Cdc2/cychn A and Cdc2/cychn B in G2/M phase<br>
Cychn-dependent kinase type 4 (CDK4), plays a key role in allowing cells to traverse G1 to S-phase transition of the cell cycle and is constitutively activated in many human cancers The CDK4 activator, cyclin D1, is overexpressed and a CDK4 inhibitor, p16, is deleted in a vanety of human tumours<br>
Cdk1/Cdk2 inhibitors have been developed which reversibly block normal cells in either the G1/S-phase or at the G2/M border G2/M arrest is generally less well tolerated by the cells and consequently, they undergo apoptotic cell death Since Hsp90 also is known to affect cell survival pathways this effect may be further amplified with an Hsp90 inhibitor<br>
Wee-1<br>
 The Wee-1 protein kinase carnes out the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 on tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) This is required for activation of the G2-phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage<br>
Hsp90 transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following<br>
Mutant p53<br>
P53 is a tumour suppressor protein that causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis P53 is mutated in approximately half of all cancers   Mutant p53 associates with Hsp90 and is down-regulated in cancer lines treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, while wild type p53 levels were unaffected<br>
Progesterone receptor/ Estrogen receptor/ Androgen receptor<br>
Approximately 70% of post-menopausal women who develop breast cancer have tumours that express the estrogen receptor The first line treatment of these patients is directed at preventing signalling through this pathway and thus inhibiting tumour growth This can be done by ovarian ablation, treatment with gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists, aromatase inhibition or treatment with specific agonists which bind to the estrogen receptor but prevent further signalling Ultimately patients develop resistance to these interventions often as a consequence of crosstalk between the estrogen receptor and growth factor receptors located on the cell membrane In the unliganded state estrogen receptors are complexed with Hsp90 which facilitates hormone binding Following binding to the mature receptor Hsp90 complex the hganded receptor can bind to hormone-response elements (HREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes inyolved in maintaining cell proliferation Inhibition of Hsp90 initiates proteosomal degradation of the estrogen receptor thus preventing further growth signalling via this pathway Prostate cancers are hormone-dependent malignancies that respond to therapeutic interventions which reduce circulating levels of testosterone or prevent testosterone binding to the androgen receptor Although patients initally respond to these treatments most subsequently develop resistance via restoration of signalling via the androgen receptor Pnor to hgand binding the androgen receptor exists in a complex with Hsp90 and other co-chaperones including p23 and immunophihns This interaction maintains the androgen receptor in a high-affinity hgand binding conformation Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to proteosomal degradation of the androgen receptor and other co-chaperones which may sensitise the tumour to further hormonal therapies<br>
Mutated steroid hormone receptors that have arisen for example dunng anti-hormone therapy and which might be resistant to such therapies are likely to have a greater dependence on HSP90 for their stability and hormone binding function<br>
Hrf-1a<br>
Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes which play a role in angiogenesis HIF-1a is expressed in the majority of metastases and is known to associate with Hsp90 Ansamycin treatment of renal carcinoma cell lines leads to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1a<br>
Hsp90 inhibitors are capable of affecting a large number of targets significant to signal transduction in tumour cell proliferation Signal transduction inhibitors which regulate the activities of a single target, may not be as efficacious due to signalling pathway redundancy and the rapid development of resistance<br>
By regulating multiple targets inyolved in cell signalling and cell proliferation HSP90 inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of a wide spectrum of proliferative disorders<br>
ZAP70<br>
ZAP-70, a member of the Syk-ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase family, is normally expressed in T cells and natural killer cells and has a critical role in the initiation of T-cell signalling However, it is also expressed aberrantly in approximately 50% of cases of CLL, usually in those cases with unmutated B-cell receptor genes The mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (lgVH) genes in the leukemic cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an important prognostic factor The expression of ZAP-70 in CLL cells correlates with lgVH mutational status, disease progression, and survival ZAP-70 positive CLL is more aggressive than ZAP-70 negative CLL indicating that ZAP-70 may be a key dnyer of malignancy in this disease ZAP-70 is physically associated with HSP90 in B-CLL lymphoblasts thus the inhibition of Hsp90 may sensitise these cells to existing chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody therapy<br>
Heat Shock Proteins and antitumour drug resistance<br>
It has long been recognized that the native tertiary conformation of any given polypeptide is determined by its primary (amino acid) sequence However, as explained above, it is now clear that the proper folding of many proteins in vivo requires the assistance of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones     While this chaperone function is<br>
 important to normal cellular function under all conditions, it becomes crucial in cells which are stressed (for example by heat, hypoxia or acidosis)<br>
Such conditions typically prevail in tumour cells, which exist in a hostile host enyironment The upregulation of Hsps often seen in such cells is therefore likely to represent a mechanism by which malignant cells maintain the integnty of their proteomes under conditions which compromise protein folding Thus, modulators or inhibitors of stress proteins in general (and Hsp90 in particular) represent a class of chemotherapeutics with the unique ability to inhibit multiple aberrant signaling pathways simultaneously They can therefore exert antitumour effects whilst eliminating (or reducing the incidence of) resistance relative to other treatment paradigms<br>
Moreover, therapeutic anticancer interventions of all types necessanly increase the stresses imposed on the target tumour cells In mitigating the deleterious effects of such stresses, Hsps are directly implicated in resisting the effects of cancer drugs and treatment regimens Thus, modulators or inhibitors of stress protein function in general (and Hsp90 in particular) represent a class of chemotherapeutics with the potential for (i) sensitizing malignant cells to anticancer drugs and/or treatments, (n) alleviating or reducing the incidence of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments, (in) reversing resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments, (iv) potentiating the activity of anticancer drugs and/or treatments, (v) delaying or preventing the onset of resistance to anticancer drugs and/or treatments<br>
HSP90 Inhibitors as anti-fungal, anti-protozoal and anti-parasitic agents<br>
Fungal infections have become a major cause for concern in recent years due to the limited number of antifungal agents available, and the the increasing incidence of species that are resistant to established antifungal agents such as the azoles In addition, the growing population of immunocompromised patients (e g patients such as organ transplant patients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, burn patients, AIDS patients, or patients with diabetic ketoacidosis) has given rise to an increase in the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections by fungal agents such as Candida, Cryptoccocus and Aspergillus species and, on occasion, Fusanum, Tnchosporon and Dreschlera species<br>
Consequently, there is a need for new anti-fungal agents that can be used to treat the growing numbers of patients with fungal infections and in particular infections due to fungi that have become resistant to existing antifungal drugs<br>
HSP90 is conserved across evolution being found in bactena (e g HTPG in E coll) and yeast (e g HSC82 and HSP82) Although clients have not been formally identified for the E coh form, in yeast and all higher organisms the HSP90 family has been shown to function as a chaperone for many essential proteins as described above<br>
Infection by a range of pathogens is associated with an antibody response to HSP90 For example in Candida albicans infected patients the 47kDa C-terminal fragment of HSP90 is an immunodominant epitope Furthermore this antibody response is associated with good prognosis suggesting a protective effect against infection Recombinant antibodies to an epitope in this polypeptide are also protective against infection in mouse models of inyasive candidiasis (See Mathews et al Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 2003 vol 47, 2208 - 2216 and references therein) Likewise surface expressed HSP90 serves as an antigen in Chagas' disease, ascanasis, leishmaniasis, toxoplamosis and infection due to Schistosoma mansoni and it has been postulated that antibodies to HSP90 conyey protection against plamodium infection and Malana<br>
Mycograb (NeuTec Pharma/Novartis) is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody against heat shock protein 90 that is being developed as a treatment for Candida and has shown significant responses in early trials Furthermore, the natural product HSP90 inhibitors Geldanamycin, Herbimycin and Radicicol were originally identified by their antifungal activity Key essential proteins have been identified as HSP90 clients in several human pathogens (see Cowen and Lindquist, Science 2005 Sep 30,309(5744)2175-6) Thus HSP90 can play an important role in the growth of pathogens such as Candida species, and HSP90 inhibitors can be useful as treatments for a range of infectious diseases including candidiasis<br>
It has also been found that Hsp90 increases the capacity of fungi to develop antifungal drug resistance (see Cowen LE, Lindquist S "Hsp90 potentiates the rapid evolution of new traits drug resistance in diverse fungi" Science 2005 Sep 30,309 (5744)2185-9) Therefore, co-administration of an Hsp90 inhibitor with an antifungal drug may enhance the efficacy of the antifungal drug and reduce resistance by preventing the emergence of resistant phenotypes<br>
HSP90 Inhibitors in the treatment of pain, neuropathic conditions and stroke<br>
Cdk5 is a member of the Cdk family of serine/threonine kinases, most of which are key regulators of the cell cycle Cdk5 activity is regulated through association with its neuron-specific activators, p35 and p39 Recent evidence suggests that CDK5 can phosphorylate tau protein and a number of other neuronal proteins such as NUDE-1, synapsinl,<br>
DARPP32 and the Munc18/Syntaxin1A complex The evidence also suggests that aberrant Cdk5 activity induced by the conyersion of p35 to p25 plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Niemann's Pick type-C disease (NPD) Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau after Aß1-42 treatment destabilizes microtubules, contributing to neunte degeneration and the formation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), one of the principal lesions of AD It has furher been found that cdk5 is necessary for correct neuronal development<br>
The p35 protein which acts as a regulator of CDK5 activity has recently been identified as a client protein for HSP90 and therefore the activity of CDK5 can be regulated by changes in the level and activity of HSP90 Thus inhibition of HSP90 can lead to loss of p35, an inhibition of CDK5, a reduction of phosphorylated tau protein in susceptible individuals and will bring benefit to sufferers of Alzheimers Disease<br>
Additionally inhibition of HSP90 using known agents has been shown to reduce the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in cellular systems in vitro (Dickey et al Curr Alzheimer Res 2005 Apr,2(2) 231-8)<br>
Cdk5 has also been shown to have a role in mediating pain signalling Both Cdk5 and p35 have been shown to be expressed in nociceptive neurons In p35 knockout mice, which show substantially reduced Cdk5 activity, the response to painful thermal stimuli is delayed (Pareek, TK, et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103 791-796 (2006) Additionally administration of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) inhibitor roscovitine has been shown to attenuate the formalin-induced nociceptive responses in rats (Wang, Cheng-haung, et al, Acta Pharmacologica Sinica , 26 46-50 (2005) Activation of calpain is calcium dependent and is known to affected by activation of the NMDA receptor calcium channel (Amadoro, G, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 103, 2892-2897 (2006)) -NMDA receptor antagonists are know to be clinically effective against neuropathic pain conditions (Chnstoph, T, et al, Neuropharmacology, 51,12-17 (2006)) This efficacy may be linked to the effect of NMDA receptor related calcium influx on calpain activity and its subsequent effect on the activity of Cdk5 As such compounds modulating Cdk5 activity will be useful for the treatment or prevention of pain and thus modulation of the CDK5 regulator p35 by HSP90 inhibition could lead to inhibition of CDK5<br>
It is desirable to have an agent for the palliative treatment of pain, 1 e the direct relief of pain in addition to the relief of pain as the result of amelioration of the underlying disease or medical condition, which is the cause of the pain<br>
Various Cdk's (especially Cdk's 4, 5 &amp; 6) have been shown to be inyolved with or mediate neuronal death following hypoxic or ischemic insult (Rashidan, J , et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 102 14080-14085 (2005) Furthermore the Cdk inhibitor flavopindol has been shown to significantly reduce neuronal death in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia (Osuga, H , et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 97 10254-10259 (2000) Cdk5 inhibitors have been shown to have protective effects in both necrotic and apoptotic paradigms of neuronal cell death (Weishaupt, J , et al, Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience , 24 489-502 (2003)<br>
Stroke is a cerebrovascular event, which occurs when the normal bloodflow to the brain is disrupted, and the brain receives too much or too little blood Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is also one of the most common causes of neurologic disability<br>
Ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke, results from insufficient cerebral circulation of blood caused by obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood Normally, adequate cerebral blood supply is ensured by a system of arteries within the brain However, vanous disorders, including inflammation and atherosclerosis, can cause a thrombus, i e , a blood clot that forms in a blood vessel The thrombus may interrupt arterial blood flow, causing brain ischemia and consequent neurologic symptoms Ischemic stroke may also be caused by the lodging of an embolus (an air bubble) from the heart in an intracranial vessel, causing decreased perfusion pressure or increased blood viscosity with inadequate cerebral blood flow An embolus may be caused by various disorders, including atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis<br>
A second type of stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, inyolves a hemorrhage or rupture of an artery leading to the brain Hemorrhagic stroke results in bleeding into brain tissue, including the epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid space of the brain A hemorrhagic stroke typically results from the rupture of an arteriosclerotic vessel that has been exposed to artenal hypertension or to thrombosis<br>
One opportunity for intervention in stroke is the prevention or reduction of risk of stroke in patients at risk for stroke There are many known nsk factors for stroke, including vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and atnal fibrillation At nsk patients have been treated with agents to control blood pressure or manage blood lipid level, and have been treated with antiplatelet agents (such as clopidrogel) and anticoagulants A second opportunity is the treatment of acute stroke However, current pharmacologic therapies for treating acute stroke are limited to restonng blood flow within a narrow therapeutic time window of less than three hours after stroke<br>
Jhere remains a need for agents which are effective within a longer therapeutic time window   Another opportunity is recovery or restoration after the acute stroke penod, i e the reduction or prevention of secondary cell damage in the penumbra There remains a need for agents which are effective in reducing or preventing secondary cell damage after stroke<br>
It would be desirable to obtain a single pharmaceutical agent which can be used in more than one of the above-mentioned opportunities for treating stroke Such an agent may be administered to patients at risk for stroke, and also may be administered to patients suffering from acute stroke, or patients undergoing treatment for recovery or restoration after the acute stroke penod Such an agent may also target more than one distinct mechanism in the biochemical cascade of stroke<br>
HSP90 inhibitors and the treatment of Hepatitis C and other viral diseases<br>
Infection of a host cell with viral RNA/DNA results in a substantial redirection of cellular protein sysnthesis towards key viral proteins encoded by the viral nucleic acid The increased protein synthetic burden places a stress on the cell as a consequence of increased demand for energy and synthetic precursers Upregulation of heat shock proteins is frequently a consequence of viral infection at least in part due to this stress One function of the HSP induction may be to assist in the stabilization and folding of the high levels of 'foreign' protein generated in preparation for virus replication In particular recent work has suggested that HSP90 is required for stable production of functional NS2/3 protease in Hepatitis C (HCV) replicon infected cells HSP 90 inhibitors have also been demonstrated to block viral replication in in vitro systems (Nagkagawa, S, Umehara T, Matsuda C, et al Biochem Biophys Res Commun 353 (2007) 882-888, Waxman L, Witney, M et al PNAS 98 (2001) 13931 - 13935)<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
In this specification, the terms "compounds of the inyention" or "compound of the inyention", unless the context indicates otherwise, refer collectively to (a) the novel compound of formula (10) and its salts, solvates, N-oxides and tautomers, (b) the acid addition salts of compound (1) (particularly the L-lactate salt), and (c) the crystalline forms of the compound of formula (1) and its acid addition salts (particularly the L-lactate)<br>
As used herein, the term "treatment" and the related terms "treat" and "treating" refer to both prophylactic or preventative treatment as well as curative or palliative treatment of pain Thus, the term encompasses situations where pain is already being experienced by a subject or patient, as well as situations where pain is not currently being expenenced but is expected to anse The term "treatment", "treat", "treating" and related terms also cover both complete and partial pain reduction or prevention Thus, for example, the compounds of the inyention may prevent existing pain from worsening, or they reduce or even eliminate pain When used in a prophylactic sense, the compounds may prevent any pain from developing or they may lessen the extent of pain that may develop<br>
As used herein, the term "modulation", as applied to the activity of the heat shock protein Hsp90, is intended to define a change in the level of biological activity of the heat shock protein Thus, modulation encompasses physiological changes which effect an increase or decrease in the relevant heat shock protein activity   In the latter case, the modulation may<br>
 <br>
be described as "inhibition" The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post-translational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of heat shock protein activity Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of the heat shock protein, including gene amplification (i e multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activity and (de)activation of the heat shock protein (including (de)activation) by mutation(s) The terms "modulated", "modulating" and "modulate" are to be interpreted accordingly<br>
As used herein, the term "mediated", as used eg in conjunction with the heat shock protein as described herein (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate hmitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which heat shock protein Hsp90 plays a biological role In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by heat shock protein Hsp90 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression) Thus, heat shock protein Hsp90 activity (and in particular aberrant levels of heat shock protein Hsp90 activity, e g Hsp90 over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition rather, it is contemplated that the heat shock protein Hsp90 mediated diseases, states or conditions include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which Hsp90 is only partially inyolved In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention (e g in the "Hsp90-mediated treatments" and "Hsp90-mediated prophylaxis" of the inyention), the role played by Hsp90 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention Thus, a disease state or condition mediated by Hsp90 includes the development of resistance to any particular cancer drug or treatment (including in particular resiatnce to one or more of the signalling inhibitors described herein)<br>

described as "inhibition" The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post-translational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), or at the level of enzyme (e g cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activity (for example by allostenc mechanisms, competitive inhibition, active-site inactivation, perturbation of feedback inhibitory pathways etc) Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of the cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) including gene amplification (i e multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activity and (de)activation of the cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) including (de)activation) by mutation(s) The terms "modulated", "modulating" and "modulate" are to be interpreted accordingly<br>
As used herein, the term "mediated", as used e g in conjunction with the cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) as described herein (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate hmitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) plays a biological role In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression) Thus, cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activity (and in particular aberrant levels of cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activity, eg cychn dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition rather, it is contemplated that the CDK5-mediated diseases, states or conditions include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which CDK5 In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention (e g in the "CDK5-mediated treatments" of the inyention), the role played by CDK5 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention<br>
The term "intervention" is a term of art used herein to define any agency which effects a physiological change at any level Thus, the intervention may comprise the induction or repression    of    any    physiological    process,     event,     biochemical     pathway    or<br>
cellular/biochemical event The interventions of the inyention typically effect (or contnbute to) the therapy, treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition<br>
As used herein, the term "combination", as applied to two or more compounds and/or agents (also referred to herein as the components), is intended to define material in which the two or more compounds/agents are associated The terms "combined" and "combining" in this context are to be interpreted accordingly<br>
The association of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination may be physical or non-physical   Examples of physically associated combined compounds/agents include<br>
•	compositions (eg unitary formulations) comprising the two or more compounds/agents in admixture (for example within the same unit dose),<br>
•	compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically linked (for example by crosshnking, molecular agglomeration or binding to a common vehicle moiety),<br>
•	compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically co-packaged (for example, disposed on or within lipid vesicles, particles (e g micro- or nanoparticles) or emulsion droplets),<br>
•	pharmaceutical kits, pharmaceutical packs or patient packs in which the two or more compounds/agents are co-packaged or co-presented (e g as part of an array of unit doses),<br>
Examples of non-physically associated combined compounds/agents include<br>
•	matenal (e g a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for the extemporaneous association of the at least one compound to form a physical association of the two or more compounds/agents,<br>
•	material (e g a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for combination therapy with the two or more compounds/agents,<br>

• material comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents in an amount or in a form which is specifically adapted for use in combination with the other(s) of the two or more compounds/agents<br>
As used herein, the term "in combination" may refer to compounds/agents that are administered as part of the same overall treatment regimen As such, the posology of each of the two or more compounds/agents may differ each may be administered at the same time or at different times It will therefore be appreciated that the compounds/agents of the combination may be administered sequentially (e g before or after) or simultaneously, either in the same pharmaceutical formulation (i e together), or in different pharmaceutical formulations (i e separately) Simultaneously in the same formulation is as a unitary formulation whereas simultaneously in different pharmaceutical formulations is non-unitary The posologies of each of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination therapy may also differ with respect to the route of administration<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical kit" defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition together with dosing means (e g measuring device) and/or delivery means (e g inhaler or syringe), optionally all contained within common outer packaging In pharmaceutical kits comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack The pharmaceutical kit may optionally further comprise instructions for use<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical pack" defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition, optionally contained within common outer packaging In pharmaceutical packs comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack The pharmaceutical pack may optionally further comprise instructions for use<br>
As used herein, the term "patient pack" defines a package, prescnbed to a patient, which contains pharmaceutical compositions for the whole course of treatment Patient packs usually contain one or more blister pack(s) Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions<br>
Acid Addition salts<br>
In a first aspect, the inyention provides an acid addition salt of a compound of the formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which has the chemical name (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone<br>
The terms "salt" and "acid addition salt" may be used interchangeably in this application as may the terms "salts" and "acid addition salts" The terms "salt" and "salts" as used herein refer to the acid addition salts unless the context indicates otherwise<br>
References to the compound (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone and its acid addition salts include within their scope all solvates, tautomers and isotopes thereof and, where the context admits, N-oxides and other ionic forms<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e g L-ascorbic), aspartic (eg L-aspartic), benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, camphonc (eg (+) camphoric), camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capnc, caproic, capryhc, carbonic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecanoic, dodecylsulphunc, ethane-1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumanc, galactanc, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (eg D-glucuronic), glutamic (eg L-glutamic), a-oxoglutanc, glycohc, hippunc, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydnodic, isethionic, isobutync, lactic (e g (+)-L-lactic [which may be referred to elsewhere herein simply as L-lactic acid] and (t)-DL-lactic), laurylsulphonic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, (-)-L-mahc, malonic, (±)-DL-mandehc, methanesulphonic, mucic, naphthalenesulphonic (e g naphthalene-2-sulphonic and naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic), 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitnc, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-sahcylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, tartaric (e g (+)-L-tartanc), thiocyanic, toluenesulphonic (e g p-toluenesulphonic), undecylenic, valeric acids and xinafoic acids<br>
Particular acid addition salts are the salts formed with hydrochloric acid, lactic acid (e g L-lactic acid) or sulphuric acid<br>
A preferred salt is the salt formed with lactic acid, i e the lactate salt and in particular the L-lactate salt<br>
The acid addition salts are typically pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al, 1977, "Pharmaceutical^ Acceptable Salts," J Pharm Sci, Vol 66, pp 1-19 However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be conyerted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the inyention, also form part of the inyention<br>
In the solid state, the salts of the inyention can be crystalline or amorphous or a mixture thereof<br>
In one embodiment, the salts are amorphous<br>
In an amorphous solid, the three dimensional structure that normally exists in a crystalline form does not exist and the positions of the molecules relative to one another in the amorphous form are essentially random, see for example Hancock et al J  Pharm  Sci (1997), 86, 1)<br>
In another embodiment, the salts are substantially crystalline<br>
The salts of the present inyention can be synthesized from the parent compound by conyentional chemical methods such as methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts Properties, Selection, and Use, P Heinnch Stahl (Editor), Camille G Wermuth (Editor), ISBN 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002 Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free base form of the compound of formula (1) with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two<br>
In another aspect, the inyention provides a method of prepanng an acid addition salt of (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone, which method compnses forming a solution of (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the acid addition salt<br>
The acid may be added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved   The solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved<br>
may be one in which the acid addition salt thereof is insoluble Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the acid addition salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution<br>
In an alternative method of forming an acid addition salt, (2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-<br>
phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone	is<br>
dissolved in a solvent comprising a volatile acid and optionally a co-solvent, thereby to form a solution of the acid addition salt with the volatile acid, and the resulting solution is then concentrated or evaporated to isolate the salt An example of an acid addition salt that can be made in this way is the acetate salt<br>
The salt is typically precipitated from the organic solvent as it is formed and hence can be isolated by separation of the solid from the solution, e g by filtration<br>
One salt form of the inyention can be conyerted to the free base and optionally to another salt form by methods well known to the skilled person For example, the free base can be formed by passing the salt solution through a column containing an amine stationary phase (e g a Strata-NH2 column) Alternatively, a solution of the salt in water can be treated with sodium bicarbonate to decompose the salt and precipitate out the free base The free base may then be combined with another acid by one of the methods descnbed above or elsewhere herein<br>
Salts such as acid addition salts have a number of advantages over the corresponding free base For example, the salts will enjoy one or more of the following advantages over the free base in that they<br>
will be more soluble and hence will be better for i v administration (e g by infusion)<br>
will have better stability (e g improved shelf life),<br>
will have better thermal stability,<br>
will be less basic and therefore better for i v administration,<br>
will have advantages for production,<br>
will have improved solubility in aqueous solution,<br>
will have better physicochemical properties,<br>
may have improved anti-cancer activity, and<br>
may have an improved therapeutic index<br>
Particular advantages of the L-lactate salt of the compound of formula (1) are that it<br>
is not hydrated and therefore is easier to formulate,<br>
has fewer polymorphic forms than the free base and other salt forms tested (i e the salts formed with hydrochlonc acid and sulphunc acid),<br>
is non-hygroscopic, and<br>
has a better rate of solubility than the free base and other salts tested<br>
The term 'stable' or 'stability' as used herein includes chemical stability and solid state (physical) stability The term 'chemical stability' means that the compound can be stored in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no chemical degradation or decomposition' for example for a period of six months or more, more usally twelve months or more, for example eighteen months or more 'Solid-state stability' means the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no solid-state transformation (eg hydration, dehydration, solvatisation, desolvatisation, crystallisation, recrystallisation or solid-state phase transition)<br>
The terms "non-hygroscopic" and "non-hygroscopicity" and related terms as used herein refer to substances that absorb less than 5% by weight (relative to their own weight) of water when exposed to conditions of high relative humidity, for example 90% relative humidity, and/or do not undergo changes in crystalline form in conditions of high humidity and/or do not absorb water into the body of the crystal (internal water) in conditions of high relative humidity<br>
Crystalline Forms<br>
In another aspect, the inyention provides a compound of the formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
or an acid addition salt thereof in substantially crystalline form<br>
By "substantially crystalline" is meant that the compound of formula (1) or its acid addition salt are from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly the compound of formula (1) or its salts may be at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99 5% crystalline, or at least 99 9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline<br>
More preferably the compound of formula (1) or its salts are those (or may be selected from the group consisting of those) that are 95% to 100 % crystalline, for example at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99 5% crystalline, or at least 99 6% crystalline or at least 99 7% crystalline or at least 99 8% crystalline or at least 99 9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline<br>
The crystalline forms of the inyention, in the solid state, can be solvated (e g hydrated) or non-solvated (e g anhydrous)<br>
In one embodiment, the crystalline forms are non-solvated (e g anhydrous)<br>
The term "anhydrous" as used herein does not exclude the possibility of the presence of some water on or in the salt (e g a crystal of the salt) For example, there may be some water present on the surface of the salt (e g salt crystal), or minor amounts within the body of the salt (e g crystal) Typically, an anhydrous form contains fewer than 0 4 molecules of water per molecule of compound, and more preferably contains fewer than 0 1 molecules of water per molecule of compound, for example 0 molecules of water<br>
In another embodiment, the crystalline forms are solvated Where the crystalline forms are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e g one molecule of water or two molecules of water Non-stoichiometric hydrates may also be formed in which the number of molecules of water present is less than one or is otherwise a non-integer For example, where there is less than one molecule of water present, there may be for example 0 4, or 0 5, or 0 6, or 0 7, or 0 8, or 0 9 molecules of water present per molecule of compound<br>
Other solvates include alcoholates such as ethanolates and isopropanolates<br>
The crystalline forms described herein, individual crystals thereof and their crystal structures form further aspects of the inyention<br>
The crystalline forms and their crystal structures can be characterised using a number of techniques including single crystal X-ray crystallography, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calonmetry (DSC) and infra red spectroscopy, e g Founer Transform<br>
,jnfra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) The behaviour of the crystals under conditions of varying humidity can be analysed by gravimetric vapour sorption studies and also by XRPD<br>
Determination of the crystal structure of a compound can be performed by X-ray crystallography which can be carried out according to conyentional methods, such as those descnbed herein and in Fundamentals of Crystallography, C Giacovazzo, H L Monaco, D Viterbo, F Scordan, G Gilh, G Zanotti and M Catti, (International Union of Crystallography/Oxford University Press, 1992 ISBN 0-19-855578-4 (p/b), 0-19-85579-2 (h/b)) This technique inyolves the analysis and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction of single crystal<br>
Alternatively, the crystalline structure of a compound can be analysed by the solid state technique of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) XRPD can be earned out according to conyentional methods such as those described herein and in Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffraction, Ron Jenkins and Robert L Snyder (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1996) The presence of defined peaks (as opposed to random background noise) in an XRPD diffractogram indicates that the compound has a degree of crystalhnity<br>
A compound's X-ray powder pattern is characterised by the diffraction angle (29) and interplanar spacing (d) parameters of an X-ray diffraction spectrum These are related by Bragg's equation, nA=2d Sin 0, (where n=1, A=wavelength of the cathode used, d=mterplanar spacing, and 6=diffraction angle) Herein, interplanar spacings, diffraction angle and overall pattern are important for identification of crystal in the X-ray powder diffraction, due to the characteristics of the data The relative intensity should not be strictly interpreted since it may be vaned depending on the direction of crystal growth, particle sizes and measurement conditions In addition, the diffraction angles usually mean ones which coincide in the range of 26±0 2° The peaks mean main peaks and include peaks not larger than medium at diffraction angles other than those stated above<br>
The compound of formula (1) and its acid addition salts exist in a number of different crystalline forms and these are described in more detail below and are characterised in the Examples<br>

The cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, and such cancers may be determined by a method as set out in the section headed "Methods of Diagnosis"<br>
One group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e g primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, inyasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometnoid breast cancers), and mantle cell lymphomas In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers<br>
Another sub-set of cancers includes hematopoietic tumours of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell<br>
 lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and optionally further includes chronic myelogenous leukaemia and multiple myeloma<br>
A preferred sub-set of cancers consists of ErbB2-positive breast, prostate, lung, and gastnc cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, androgen receptor dependent prostate cancer, Flt3-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia, melanoma associated with Braf mutation, multiple myeloma, velcade refractory multiple myeloma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)<br>
Of these, particularly preferred cancers are multiple myelomas and velcade refractory tumour types as defined herein<br>
Another preferred sub-set of cancers consists of hormone refractory prostate cancer, metastatic melanoma, HER2 positive breast cancer, mutant EGFR positive non-small cell lung carcinoma and Gleevec resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumours<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof could also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, parasitic disease, autoimmune diseases (e g multiple sclerosis and lupus erythematosus), neuro-degenerative disorders (eg Alzheimer's disease), inflammation, Type I and II diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiac disease<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof could also have clinical benefit in transplantation and immunosuppression<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof may also have clinical benefit in the previously described diseases when used in combination with existing or new therapeutic agents<br>
Based on the activities of Hsp90 client proteins and experimental evidence, the following disorders may be particularly sensitive to treatment by the Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof<br>
ErbB2-positive breast, prostate, lung, and gastric cancer<br>
Overexpression of ErbB2 (HER-2) occurs in approximately 30 % of breast cancers and ErbB2 receptor down-regulation by herceptm sensitized cells to Taxol   ErbB2 over-expression is linked to poor prognosis and drug resistance (Tsugawa et   al,  1993 Oncology 1993, 50 418)<br>
Mutant EGFR in lung cancer<br>
Somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including L858R and exon 19 deletions, underlie responsiveness to gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Acquired resistance to these tyrosine kinase inhibitors is in some cases mediated by a second mutation, T790M Ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin, potently inhibit heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of oncogenic kinases that require the chaperone for proper conformational folding Exposure of EGFR-mutant cell lines to geldanamycin induced marked depletion of phospho-Akt and cyclin D1 as well as apoptosis These data suggest mutational activation of EGFR is associated with dependence on Hsp90 for stability and that Hsp90 inhibition may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC<br>
Chronic myeloid Leukemia<br>
The aberrant BCR-Abl protein is created through a chromosomal translocation and results in a constitutively active Abl kinase domain This translocation event has been shown to be causal for CML P210BcrAbl is a known client protein for Hsp90 Treatment of the BCR-Abl cell line K562 with an hsp90 inhibitor induced apoptosis The Bcr-Abl inhibitor Gleevec® also induces apoptosis in K562 cells, however Gleevec® resistant K562 cells still retain sensitivity towards Hsp90 inhibitors (Gome et al 2002, Blood 100 3041-3044)<br>
Androgen receptor dependent prostate cancer<br>
The androgen receptor kinase is an Hsp90 client protein Hormone replacement therapy is usually adopted where surgery does not resolve the cancer The cancer may become refractory to hormone manipulation through receptor mutation Hsp90 regulation of the receptor would still be viable post-mutation<br>
The same would apply to estrogen-dependent breast cancers<br>
Flt3-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia<br>
Internal duplication of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 leads to its constitutive activation and oncogenesis These internal duplications are observed in 20% of all reported cases of AML and are an indication of poor prognosis Much like the activation of the ABL kinase in CML, this represents another example of a single genetic lesion giving rise to a malignancy Hsp90 inhibitors are predicted to be of clinical benefit to these patients as Flt3 is an Hsp90 client protein (Bah et al, 2004 Cancer Res 64(10) 3645-52)<br>
Melanoma associated with Braf mutation<br>
Braf encodes for a serine/threonine kinase which is mutated in 70% of all melanomas 80% of these represent a single V599E point mutation that confers elevated kinase activity<br>
to BRAF    This mutation is also transforming in NIH3T3 cells (Bignell et al, 2002 Nature 417(6892)949-54)<br>
Multiple Myeloma<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG potently inhibits proliferation of Bortezomib refractory multiple myeloma cell lines Cell surface levels of IGF-1R and IL-6R were also diminished in 17-aag treated MM-1 cells (Mitsiades et al, Blood 107 1092-1100, 2006) Autocnne stimulation of multiple myeloma cells, as well as paracrine stimulation of bone marrow stromal cells with IL-6 is also diminished through downregulation of the Hsp90 client IKK<br>
Velcade Refractory Multiple Myeloma<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof can be used in the treatment of velcade refractory tumour types including treatment of patients with second line mantle cell lymphoma, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage 1MB and IV Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma<br>
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)<br>
GIST disease particularly disease dependent on growth factor activation or overexpression (eg c-kit)<br>
Other conditions or disorders for which an Hsp90 inhibitor may be of clinical benefit include, but are not limited to<br>
Neurodegenerative disorders<br>
Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment GA inhibition of Hsp90 and the resulting up-regulation of Hsps are effective in preventing huntington protein aggregation in neuronal cells (Sittler ef al, 2001, Human Molecular Genetics, Vol 10, No 12 1307-1315) Up-regulation of HSP may also be of clinical benefit in other diseases of protein misfolding e g , CJD and Alzheimer's<br>
Inflammatory disease, including Rheumatoid arthritis, Asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and inflammatory bowel disease<br>
GA has been shown to dissociate HSF-1 from Hsp90 leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of HSF-1 HSF-1 subsequently acts as a transcnption factor to induce HSP90 and Hsp70 The induction of Hsp70 has been implicated in the resolution of inflammation in an induced mouse model of edema (lanaro et al, 2004 Human Molecular<br>
.Genetics, 2001, Vol 10, No 12 1307-1315) Additionally GA treatment inhibited IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation by TNF-a or PMA IkBa is a regulator of Nf-kB and Ap-1 (Broemer et al 2004) Ap-1 and Nf-kB is a major transcription factor leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Yeo et al, 2004 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 30, 320(3)816-24) The stability of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcnpts is also regulated through inhibition of p38 MapK (Wax et al, 2003 Rheumatism Vol 48, No 2, pp 541-550)<br>
Atherosclerosis<br>
It is known that inflammatory and immune cells play a central role in the initiation and progression of human atherosclerosis (Rigano et al, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 2007, 1107 1-10) and it has been proposed that Hsp90 acts as an autoantigen in carotid atherosclerosis Rigano et al found specific antibodies and cells against Hsp90 in the sera of 60% of patients tested who were suffering from carotid atherosclerotic plaques but no specific antibodies and T cells against Hsp90 in the sera of healthy patients Therefore, the Hsp90 inhibitor compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and the salts (particularly the L-lactate) and crystalline forms thereof should be useful in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis<br>
Angiogenesis related disease, including but not limited to tumour angiogenesis. psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy<br>
Induction of angiogenesis is regulated by Hsp90 client proteins eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells (Sun and Liao, 2004 Artenoscler Thromb Vase Biol  24(12) 2238-44) Suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a can also impair the growth, angiogenesis and vessel maturation of gastric tumours in a mouse model (Stoeltzing et al, 2004 J Natl Cancer Inst, 96 946-956)<br>
Type I and type II diabetes<br>
Hsp90 inhibition has a profound effect on Akt signalling as well as e-nos These are two key regulators in high glucose induced endothelial cell apoptosis in type I diabetes (Lin et al, 2005 J Cell Biochem 1, 94(1) 194-201) and the development of hypertension in type II diabetes (Kobayashi et al, 2004 Hypertension 44(6) 956-62)<br>
Immunosuppression and transplantation<br>
Hsp90 inhibition has been shown to down regulate Lck, a T-cell specific tyrosine kinase required for T-cell activation   (Yorgin et al, 2000 J Immunol 15, 164(6) 2915-23)<br>
Cardiac disease<br>
Cardiac ischemic is the most common cause of death in the western world Hsps, and notably Hsp70 (induced by radicicol treatment) have demonstrated cardioprotective activity in rat cardiomyocytes (Griffin et al, 2004) Inhibition of Hsp90 results in the release of HSF-1 from the chaperone complex and its subsequent activation of Hsp genes Inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to the down-regulation of HIF-1, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and stroke<br>
Infectious disease<br>
Hepatits C viral NS2/3 protease is an Hsp90 client protein and Hsp90 activity is required for viral processing and replication (Whitney et   al, 2001   Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 20,98(24)13931-5)<br>
Parasitic disease<br>
GA has reported antimalarial activity against an Hsp90 ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium growth was inhibited with GA at an IC50 similar to that observed with chloroquine   GA was also effective against chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Kamaret al, 2003 Malar J 15, 2(1) 30)<br>

hERG<br>
In the late 1990s a number of drugs, approved by the US FDA, had to be withdrawn from sale in the US when it was discovered they were implicated in deaths caused by heart malfunction It was subsequently found that a side effect of these drugs was the development of arrhythmias caused by the blocking of hERG channels in heart cells The hERG channel is one of a family of potassium ion channels the first member of which was identified in the late 1980s in a mutant Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly (see Jan, L Y and Jan, Y N (1990) A Superfamily of Ion Channels Nature, 345(6277) 672) The biophysical properties of the hERG potassium ion channel are described in Sanguinetti, M C, Jiang, C , Curran, M E , and Keating, M T (1995) A Mechanistic Link Between an Inherited and an Acquired Cardiac Arrhythmia HERG encodes the Ikr potassium channel Cell, 81 299-307, and Trudeau, M C , Warmke, J W, Ganetzky, B , and Robertson, G A (1995) HERG, a Human Inward Rectifier in the Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Family Science, 269 92-95<br>

Anti-viral Activity<br>
As discussed above in the introductory sections of this application, infection of a host cell with viral RNA/DNA results in a substantial redirection of cellular protein synthesis towards key viral proteins encoded by the viral nucleic acid, and this frequently gives rise to upregulation of heat shock proteins It is believed that one function of the HSP induction may be to assist in the stabilization and folding of the high levels of 'foreign' protein generated in preparation for virus replication and it has been shown (Nagkagawa ef a/) that HSP 90 inhibitors can block viral replication Accordingly, the compounds of the inyention are useful in combatting viral infections, for example by blocking or inhibiting viral replication<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e g formulation) comprising at least one active compound of the inyention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable earners, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)<br>
Thus, the present inyention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e g human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio Each carrier, excipient, etc must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the inyention provides compound of the inyention as defined herein and in particular compounds of the formulae (10) and (1) and crystalline and salt forms thereof as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
 The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intrapentoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bactenostats, co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cyclodextnn complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellable polymers for forming polymenc gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendenng the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration may also take the form of aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents (R G Stnckly, Solubihzing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230)<br>
A drug molecule that is lonizable can be solubilized to the desired concentration by pH adjustment if the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneously the range is pH 2 7-9 0 The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tns(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (TRIS), or carbonate<br>
The combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i e , a cosolvent) is often used in injectable formulations The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrohdone (NMP, Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS 15, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80 Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection<br>
Propylene glycol, PEG 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available<br>
injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion<br>
Alternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextnns<br>
Liposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of 
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dned (lyophihsed) condition requiring only the addition of the stenle liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophihsing a compound of the inyention or acid addition salt thereof Lyophihsation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition Freeze-drying and lyophihsation are therefore used herein as synonyms A typical process is to solubihse the compound and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophihsation (eg vials) In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophihsation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry lyophile formulation The composition will typically have a low residual water content, e g less than 5% e g less than 1% by weight based on weight of the lyophile<br>
The lyophihsation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid salts Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal,<br>
benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyndinium chloride The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary<br>
Bulking agents are generally used in lyophihsation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integnty to the lyophilized cake Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitution The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic<br>
The water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutical^ acceptable inert solid matenals typically used for lyophihsation Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose, polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol, amino acids such as glycine, polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidine, and polysaccharides such as dextran<br>
The ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e g in the range of about 1 to 2<br>
Alternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial     Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropnate stages of the formulation process The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the inyention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i v administration, for example by injection or infusion<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s c) administration<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA<br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol, and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e g swellable crosshnked polymers such as crosshnked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e g stearates), preservatives (e g parabens), antioxidants (e g BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof<br>
The solid dosage forms (eg, tablets, capsules etc) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e g a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating The coating (e g a Eudragit ™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum Alternatively or additionally, the coating can be used as a taste masking agent to mask unpleasant tastes such as bitter tasting drugs The coating may contain sugar or other agents that assist in masking unpleasant tastes<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e g a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound   Osmotic release and other<br>
delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with  methods well known to those skilled in the art<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in "patient packs" containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescnptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions<br>

The compounds are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a compound of the formula (I) may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner<br>
A typical daily dose of the compound of the inyention can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams<br>
per kilogram (eg 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams, and more typically 1 microgram per kilogram to 20 milligrams per kilogram, for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams per kilogram) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required The compound can be administered on a daily basis or on a repeat basis every 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 or 14, or 21, or 28 days for example<br>

More particularly, a patient may be given an infusion of a compound for periods of one hour daily for 5 days and the treatment repeated every three weeks<br>
In another particular dosing schedule, a patient is given an infusion over 30 minutes to 1 hour followed by maintenance infusions of variable duration, for example 1 to 5 hours, e g 3 hours<br>
In a further particular dosing schedule, a patient is given a continuous infusion for a period of 12 hours to 5 days, an in particular a continuous infusion of 24 hours to 72 hours<br>
Ultimately, however, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician<br>
The compounds as defined herein can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined<br>

For the case of Hsp90 inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes<br>
Where the compound is administered in combination therapy with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, more preferably one), the compounds can be administered simultaneously or sequentially When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s)<br>
The compounds of the inyention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy, surgery and controlled diets<br>
For use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the compound and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through his or her common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use<br>
Methods of Diagnosis<br>
Prior to administration of a compound, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffenng is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Hsp90<br>
For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to the mutation or over-activation of an Hsp90 client protein Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation of Hsp90 client proteins include, Bcr-ABL translocation, Flt-3 internal duplication, and mutation of Braf, or over-expression of ErbB2<br>
Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation The term diagnosis includes screening By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Braf, BCR-abl, and Flt3 or other affected client proteins The term marker also includes proteins such as ErbB2, including levels or concentrations of the protein or some fragments or degradation product and for enzymes the enzymic activity The protein (eg phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins could also be assessed to characterise a change in activity For example the level of phosphorylated AKT can be an indicator of sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors<br>
The diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from for example tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and ennchment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, buccal spears or biopsy or from unne<br>
I The screening process will typically inyolve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide or protein microarray analysis, proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry, immunohistochemical techniques or detection using a specific antibody<br>
Methods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are well known to a person skilled in the art Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcnptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in-situ hybridisation or immunoblotting<br>
In screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F M et al, eds Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc , or Innis, M A et-al, eds PCR Protocols a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego Reactions and manipulations inyolving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al, 2001, 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828, 4,683,202, 4,801,531, 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference<br>
An example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybndisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth Enzymol, 152 649)<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed, (2) prehybndization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce non-specific binding, (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue, (4) post-hybndization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments The probes used in such applications are typically labelled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stnngent conditions Commercially available FISH probes also exist for cytogenetic detection of chromosome rearrangemrnts, which can be used to detect Flt3 and Bcr-Abl translocations within leukeamia cell populations Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F M et al, eds   Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004,<br>

Methods for gene expression profiling are described by (DePnmo et al, BMC Cancer 2003, 3 3) Briefly, the protocol is as follows double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from total RNA Using a (dT)24 oligomer for priming first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers The double-stranded cDNA is used as a template for in vitro transcription of cRNA using biotinylated ribonucleotides cRNA is chemically fragmented according to protocols descnbed by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), and then hybridized overnight on Human Genome Arrays<br>
Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of the "Philadelphia chromosome" indicative of BCR-ABL translocation<br>
Therefore, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the compounds of the inyention<br>
