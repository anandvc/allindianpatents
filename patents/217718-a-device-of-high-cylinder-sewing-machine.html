machine, especially refer to a high cylinder which can be alternated adequately and conveniently in accord with the size of sewing materials.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A conventional high-cylinder type sewing machine uses proper type of cylinder (shown as Fig.1) to stitch various sizes of bag. The needle base 13 contains spindle with needle plate 14 at side, fixed on the high-cylinder 12, and form a free rotate needle base by the axis of spindle<br>
shaft.<br>
Assembly base 10 fixed on the shaft center holds the "C" shape high-cylinder 12 in order to rotate the "C" shape high-cylinder 12 freely, and arrange wheel 27 in the inner side to translate the rotate movement (not shown) into vertical movement and finally reach spindle; whereby the "C" shape part of high-cylinder of various brand of high-cylinder sewing machine is built in a solid structure and form into an independent sewing machine; therefore, various kinds of sewing machine has to be prepared to meet the requirements of stitching processing or different stitching materials, and cause idle machines and spending the alternating time.<br>
Accordingly, changing the high-cylinder part of conventional high-cylinder sewing machine including assembly base 10 into another type has to be replaced in whole.<br>
In addition, the replacement will cause time-consuming, labor losing, and inefficiency due to the clumsy body of these rotating high-cylinder type sewing machine bigger than usual high-cylinder type sewing machine.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a high-cylinder sewing machine by which replacement of the part of high-cylinder without pushing down the sewing machine. It is further object of present invention to provide a high-cylinder sewing machine by which the rotating high-cylinder designed into separable parts of high-cylinder A and high-cylinder B; whereas high-cylinder A used to transmit the rotation movement from lower shaft and translate into vertical rotation by means of right angle translation mechanism forms the horizontal high-cylinder unit; whereby high cylinder B support the rotation transmission mechanism to reach the spindle.<br>
The designation of unitary high cylinder mainly arranges an alignment washer and fork plate on the driving shaft to assemble two high-cylinder units into correct position.<br>
Therefore, the further object of the present invention of rotating high-cylinder sewing machine is to make high-cylinder replacement in more convenient and economic efficiency.  <br>
  The  present invention therefore  provides a device of high-cylinder sewing machine comprising:<br>
a first high-cylinder fixed on the assembly base connecting with a second high-cylinder on one end, and fitted with an alignment shaft and acentric shaft;<br>
a second high-cylinder fitted with a groove and fork plate at upper and lower portion respectively, wherein the groove is opposite to alignment washer, and fork plate is opposite to acentric shaft; said first high cylinder and second high cylinder is fastened by means of the combination of alignment washer and groove, acentric shaft and fork plate.<br>

The rotation energy of top driving shaft 87 transmits to wheel 103 by means of connection 97.<br>
The crown wheel 116 mesh with bevel wheel<br>
The wheel 116 and the wheel 103 engage with each other.<br>
The bearing 112 is stationery to the center of spindle shaft base 111, and fixed the concave part by means of the side needle plate 14 of needle base 13 so as to make wheel 116 rotate freely by the center of the bearing 112.<br>
The function of ball connection B60 is the same as ball connection B48 possessed a concave groove with a ball like outlook. The ball connection B48 fixed in the center of the bearing 62 of high cylinder B12' for free rotation, and connected with connection ring A41 by means of fixed ring 61,63 to prevent from shifting, and mounted a connection on the other end 64.<br>
In high cylinder B12', the driving shaft 70 is fixed in the middle of bearings 68, and can rotate freely, and further fix by means of fixed ring 67, 69 at both ends to prevent from shift, and at one end of the driving shaft fitted with a connection 66, and a crown wheel 71 on the other end,<br>
then transmit the rotation energy by means of the rotation of connection 65 and ball connection 60.<br>
The driving shaft 80 is fixed between of top and bottom bearing 81,84 and can rotate freely, and the bearings 81,84 is fitted in the high cylinder B12' and fixed by means of fixed ring 82, 83 at both ends to prevent from shift, and mounted a crown wheel 79 at one end of the driving shaft to mesh with crown wheel 71, and on the other end of the driving shaft mounted a crown wheel 85 to engage with crown wheel 104.<br>
The driving shaft 107 is fixed between bearings 105,109 for free rotation, whereby the bearings 105,190 is fitted in setting-up base 89 of the high cylinder B12' by means of fixed ring 106,108 to prevent from shift, and a crown wheel 104 mounted at one end of the driving shaft 107, wheel 110 mounted at the other end.<br>
The top spindle driving shaft 113 is fitted in the center of spindle bearing 112 for free rotation, the top spindle driving shaft 113 assembled with wheel 110 and fixed a spindle 115 on the top.<br>
In order to align the shaft center of the bottom spindle driving shaft 28 with the spindle driving shaft 111, the spindle driving shaft 111 is fixed in the high cylinder B12'.<br>
Acentric shaft 22 is fixed in the lower side of high cylinder A11' and assembled with fork plate 20 at the lower of high cylinder B12', the setup of acentric shaft 22 and fork plate 20 is to set respective distance to assembly alignment washer 18 into a A 
The bolts 24,25 are used to assemble high cylinder A11 and high cylinder B12.<br>
Action describes as follows:<br>
The lower shaft rotation (not shown) is actuated from wheel 27, and translates into vertical rotation by means of the bevel wheel of bottom spindle driving shaft 28 and spindle driving wheel 42 in a 1 to 1 proportion pitch movement, and pass through the separable combination<br>
of shaft direction of connection A45 and ball connection B60, and translate rotation direction in a 1 to 1 proportion pitch movement by means of crown wheel 71,79, and once more translate rotation direction in a 1 to 1 proportion pitch movement by means of crown wheel 110,113 to reach the spindle 115.<br>
The combination of high cylinder A11' and high cylinder B12' rotates by the axis of shaft 26, the rotation of inner mechanism of high cylinder A11' and high cylinder B12' actuate the wheel 38 meshed by wheel 37, and pass through the separable combination of shaft direction of<br>
connection A41 , ball connection B48 and rotation proportion 1 to 1 pitch<br>
of crown wheel 59,72 to alternate rotation direction, and transmit the rotation movement to wheel 103 by means of the 1:1 rotation pitch of crown wheel 78,86.<br>
The shape of wheel 103 mentioned above is similar to the wheel 38 and the shape of wheel 37 is similar to that of wheel 116 so as to keep needle plate base 13 and the direction of needle plate at the same position. 14<br>
When loosen the bolts 24 , 25 under the bottom of high cylinder A11', and move high cylinder B12' along the high cylinder A11' apart, the ball connection B48 , 60 depart from connection A41 , 45 and the rotation stops.<br>
In order to match the fixture pin of connection ring A41 - 45 with fork<br>
groove of ball connection B48 - 60 for connection, the direction of high<br>
cylinder B12' must set to make fork groove of ball connection B48 , 60<br>
opposite to fixture pin 46 , 47. The high cylinder A11' guide high cylinder B12' to slide left hand side shown as Fig. 4.<br>
Connect the alignment washer 18 with groove 19 of high cylinder B12', and continue to slide high cylinder B12' till the acentric bolt 22 hook with fork plate 20, simultaneously because of designation of ball type shape<br>
of ball connections B48 , 60, the connection A41 and ball connection<br>
B48, and the connection A45 and ball connection B60 can be assembled conveniently. Acentric bolt 22 can be rolled to micro-adjust the position of spindle to needle, when depart or assemble the high cylinders.<br>
The present invention divides driving shaft, and transmit by means of the groove with ball-type outlook connection, therefore split the unitary high cylinder structure into two, and still easy to assemble the driving division.<br>
Furthermore, the high cylinder can only be changed to fix without pushing down the sewing machine to save time and labor, and increase high efficiency and decrease the cost burden of stitching processor.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures.<br>
