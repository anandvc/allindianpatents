This  Invention relates to an automatic brake  adjuster, primarily for a vehicle brake,  operable  to maintain a substantially constant clearance between the braking surfaces  respectively of a braking element and a  rota table braking member of the brake,   the adjuster being of the kind conprising a strut having two parts between which  there is a non-reversible  screw threaded connection permitting  the effective length of the strut to be increased by relative rotation between the parts under the  influence of an adjuster device operable in response  to the occurrence of excessive clearance between said surfaces.<br>
One  form of adjuster of  this kind as   applied to a  shoe drum brake  is known and it is an object of the present invention to improve and simplify certain aspects of such an adjuster.<br>
According to the  invention,  an automatic brake  adjuster comprises a strut having two parts between which there is a non-reversible  screw threaded connectionpermitting the effective length of the  strut to be increased by relative rotation between the parts under the  influence of an adjuster device operable in response  to the occurrence of excessive clearance between said surfaces,   the  adjuster device including an adjuster element operatively connected to one of the  strut parts and providing a first connecting<br><br>
formation serving to connect the element to a unidirectional device acting to prevent movement of the adjuster element in a direction such as to cause de-adjustment of the strut, whilst permitting movement thereof in a direction allowing strut adjustment , and a manual adjuster shaft normally held in a non-operative position and providing a second formation capable of forming a rotary driving connection with the first formation when the shaft is moved to an operative position, the arrangement being such that as the first and second formations are brought into engagement to form said driving connection, the uni-directional device is caused to free the adjuster element for movement in a de-adjustment direction by operation of the manual adjuster shaft.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, an automatic brake adjuster comprises a strut having two parts between which there is a non-reversible screw threaded connection permitting the effective length of the strut to be increased by relative rotation between the parts under the influence of an adjuster device operable in response to the occurrence of excessive clearance between braking surfece of a brake characterised in that the adjuster device having an adjuster element rotatably mounted in a housing of the adjuster and being separate from and operatively connected to one of the stait parts, and a unidirectional device contained within the adjuster housing and acting to prevent movement of the adjuster element in a direction such as to cause de-adjustment of the strut, whilst permitting movement  thereof in  a  direction  allowing strut adjustment, the<br><br>
unidirectional device having a tootlied element movable with the adjuster element and a relatively fixed housing element containing the toothed element and having a ratchet formation engaged with the toothed element.<br>
Preferably, the housing element and toothed element are arranged to form a self-contained unit for assembly into the adjuster.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:-<br>
Figure 1 is an elevation of part of a vehicle internal shoe drum brake with the<br>
drum removed.<br>
Figure 2 is a longitudinal cross-section of an actuator installed in the brake of<br>
Figure 1;<br>

adjuster of the invention installed in the actuator of Figure 2;<br>
Figure 4 is a reduced scale exploded view of part of the adjuster of Figure 3;<br>
Figure 5 is a fragmentary view, partly in cross-section, of an alternative form of<br>
the adjuster of the invention and<br><br>
Figure  6  is a  reduced  scale escploded view of part of  the adjuster of Figure   5,<br>
The   shoe drum brake  illustrated in Figure   1  has a pair of arcuate brake   shoes  1 and  2  mounted on a backplate   3,  each shoe  having a  friction lining 4  for braking engagement with a surrounding rotatable drum (not shown) •  The brake is of the leading/trailing type,  having an actuator  5 of appro¬priate  type*  illustrated as a cam actuator mounted on the backplate  3 between one pair of adjacent shoe ends and an abutment device  6 also mounted on or formed  integrally with the backplate and disposed between the other pair of adjacent shoe ends*   in conventional manner.<br>
As can be  seen more clearly from Figure  2,  the  actuator  5 comprises a housing 7 adapted to be fixed to the backplate 3,   usually by bolts or the  like. A  rotary cam 8 is mounted for  rotation within the  housing 7 and  co-operates via struts 9 and inserts  10 with respective tappets*indicated generally at 11,   12,   the  inserts being press-fitted within the  tappets. Each tappet 11,   12  incorporates an adjustable machanism which includes an internally threaded nut 13 through which extends a correspondingly threaded  spigot 14 projecting  from a larger diameter head portion  15 of  the tappet,   the nut and  spigot together constituting a  strut of which the  length may be varied by  relative  rotation of the  nut and spigot in order to alter the  retracted position of the adjacent brake shoe  in response to wear of the<br><br>
shoe friction lining.  The adjacent shoe abuts the nut 13, thereby effectively preventing rotation of the latter, so that, in this embodimant, the length of the strut is variable by rotating the spigot 14 in the manner to be described.  The external surface of the head 15 is formed with helical gear teeth 16 which mesh with similar teeth 17 on an end portion of an adjuster member in the form of a spigot 18 mo'.'nted in the housing 7 for rotation about an axis at right angles to that of the tappet 11,<br>
One particular form of the adjuster member and its associated mechanism is illustrated in more detail in Figures 3 and 4, The spigot 18 is provided with axlally spaced journal portions 18A, 18B which are engaged respectively in correspondingly sized portions of a through bore 19 of the housing to mount the shaft rotatably therein. The helical teeth 17 are arranged between the spigot portions 18A, 18B and mesh with the teeth 16 of the tappet head 15 (Figure 2) , as described above. A further cylindrical spigot portion 18C projects from the portion 18B and lies closely within an aperture formed in an end wall of a hollow cam 20 which lies within the bore 19 closely adjacent the wall thereof and acts to support the shaft 18 axlally of the housing. The free end of the cam 20 is provided with one or more axial tongues 20A each of which engages within a complementary peripheral formation 21 on an end closure member 22 at the outer end of the bore 19 so that the cam 20 is held thereby against<br><br>
rotation. Alternatively,  the cam 20 may be foreshortened to  lie  just clear of  the end member 22  and  thus be  free to rotate,<br>
A  cylindrical extension 23 of the  member 22 acts as a rotairy bearing for a manual  adjuster shaft 24 having an enlarged head  25 lying within the bore   19 adjacent the end member 22.   The  head 25  is provided with castellations 26  resulting from the  formation on  its inner end portion of a pair of mutually perpendicular slots 21,  28,  for the purpose  to be described.  The outer end of  the  shaft 24  is provided with a hexagonal  formation 29  to which a  spanner or  the  like may be  applied  to turn  the  shaft, when required for manual adjustment.<br>
Arranged within the  cam 20  is an inner hollow generally cylindrical  cam 30 having a base   31  through which is formed a circular opening 32, As can be  seen more clearly from Figure 4,   the  cam 30  is provided with three equi-angularly spaced slots  33 in its peripheral wall forming arms   33A,  and  the base   31 is  slit radially from its outer edge over a short distance within the peripheral extent of each slot  33,   the  respective base portions at corresponding sides of each radial slitting being inwardly upset to form downwardly projecting teeth  34.<br>
A  generally plate-like  ratchet member  35 is housed within the  cam 30 and is rotationally coupled to the adjuster shaft 18 by a nose  36 of generally oblong cross-section<br><br>
projecting  from the   inner end of  the  shaft into engagement with a correspondingly shaped  slot 36A  in the  ratchet member.   The  ratchet member  35 is provided around   its periphery with  teeth   37 which co-operate with the down¬wardly projecting teeth  34 of the  caro   30,  against the base  31 of which the  ratchet member lies. An additional ratchet conponent in the form of a ratchet plate   38 is disposed  at the opposite side of  the  ratchet member  35 and  is  slit and  upset in a similar manner to  the  base<br>
of  the  cam   30  in order to provide  teeth  39 projecting<br>
ratchet member<br>
towards the	for engagement with the  teeth<br>
thereof.  The  teeth  39 are arranged in relation to those<br>
34 of  the  cam   30  so  that each tooth  39 lies between a<br>
different pair of  teeth  34  and equl-dlstantly from the<br>
teeth of each pair,   thereby effectively making available<br>
six equi-spaced teeth for co-operation with the  teeth  37<br>
of the  ratchet member 35.    The ratchet plate  38 has an<br>
axially projecting flange 40 which rests on the  inner<br>
end  of  the  adjuster  shaft 24 and a spring 41  acts between<br>
the  inner end of  the  cam 20 and  the outer surface of  the<br>
can   30  to urge  the  assembly  30,   35,   38 towards  the  inner<br>
end of the  shaft 24  and  thereby hold  the  latter against<br>
the  inner end  of  the closure member 22,     The  ratchet plate<br>
38 has  three  radial  arms  38A spaced angularly  so  as  to<br>
lie within the  slots   33 of  the cam   30 and  thereby couple<br>
the plate   38 rotationally to the cam   30,<br>
In  an alternative  arrangement,   the  spring 41  is  arranged as  illustrated  in Figure   3 and  an additional  spring acts<br><br>
between  the  inner end of the  shaft 24  and  the  ratchet plate   38,  loading plate   38 against the  ratchet member 35 and hence  the member  35 against the  cam  30  to  increase the  load on the  ratchet components.   It also urges  the shaft 24  against the  inner end of  the  closure member 22, For manual operation,   both springs partially collapse  to permit engagement of  the formations  27 or 28 of  the  shaft 24 with  the  adjuster shaft formation   36 and  also freeing of  the  cam 30  from the member 22  to disable  the  ratchet mechanism.<br>
One  advantage  of the present arrangement is  that the  cam 30, ratchet member  35 and  ratchet plate   38 may be assembled together to form a self-contained  unit for subsequent assembly  into  the outer cage  20,  This  is achieved by forming one or more pips 42  in the  arms   33A of the  ca^" 30  and forcing the  coroponents   35 and   38 into  the  cam  30 past the pips, which are capable of limited radially out¬ward displacement due  to the  resilience of  the  arms   33A, Resilient recovery of  the  arms  returns  the pips inwardly to perform the aforesaid  retaining function.  This arrange¬ment considerably facilitates assembly of  the  adjuster on an assembly line.<br>
A   further sub-assembly can be  formed by first inserting the  sub-assembly  30,   35,   38 within the cam 20 and   then securing  the cams  30  and  20  to the end cap 22 after assembly of  the  shaft 24  in  the  latter,   the  cam 20 being<br><br>
press-fitted on to  the end cap.  This enables  the entire adjuster mechanism and manual adjuster shaft to be assembled  into  the housing  5 as a  unit and   the  required connections  to be made with  the  adjuster shaft 18 already placed  therein.     This further improves assembly rates on an assembly line.<br>
Actuation of  the brake  by  rotation of  the cam 8 causes the  tappets  11  and  12  to be  urged outwardly in order to separate the  shoes 1 and 2 into braking engagement with the brake drum,    A predetermined amount of backlash is provided between the  teeth 16 and  17 respectively on the tappet head portion 15 and adjuster shaft 18,  and by other clearances in  the  mechanism,   in order to permit sufficient separation of the shoes to take up the maximum desired shoe  to drum clearance without causing operation of  the  automatic adjuster.  When wear of the friction linings 4  becones such  that the  shoe  movement exceeds this maximum clearance,  the corresponding excessive axial movement of the tappet 11 causes the adjuster shaft 18 to rotate and thereby in turn rotate the  ratchet member  35 disposed between  the  teeth respectively on the cam   30  and  ratchet plate   38,  Since  the  ratchet wheel engages with the  three spaced  teeth on the cam   30,  or those on the   ratchet plate   38,  a  relatively  small excessive lining wear will  cause  the  ratchet wheel  to click past one or more of  these  sets of teeth alternately,  providing<br><br>
a fine, degree of  adjustment. When the brake  is released, the  adjuster shaft 18  is held  stationary  in a new position by the  ratchet wheel  locking against either the cam  30 or ratchet plate   38,  This causes  the  axial return movement of the  adjuster tappet to wind out the tappet screw 11  In a direction such as to lengthen the strut 11,   13 and  retain the  retracted  shoe  in a new outwardly adjusted position.<br>
When manual de-adjustment is required,   the manual adjuster shaft 24  is pushed  inwardly and by bearing against the cylindircal part 40 of the  ratchet plate  38, pushes the whole of the  assembly  38,   35,   30  inwardly against the spring 41,  enabling  the  nose   36 of  the adjuster shaft 18 to engage within one  of  the  slots  27,   28 of the   shaft 24 and  thereby provide a driving coupling between the shafts 24 and  18,  Simultaneously,  the free ends of the legs  33A of the  cam   30 become disengaged from the end member 22,   leaving the  aforesaid assembly free  for rotation.   The   interconnected shafts 24 and  18 may now be rotated in an appropriate direction in order to effect de-adjustment by applying a suitable  tool  to the hexagonal formation 29 at the outer end of the shaft 24. When the axially inward force on the  shaft 24  is  released,   the  spring 41 acts to  restore  the coiTtponents  to their rest positions illustrated  in Fugure  3.<br><br>
In  the  alternative embodiment described  in Figures 5 and 6,   the  general  arrangement of  the adjuster shaft  18,   the manual  adjuster shaft 24  and end member 22  are  generally similar to  the  corresponding items in Figure   3,  but the adjuster mechanism itself  is considerably  sinplified. The mechanism again includes an outer cage  20 which,  at its  inner end,   surrounds  the  cylindrical boss 18C of  the adjuster shaft 18,  and extends longitudinally as far as the end member 22, where castellated portions  20A of  its outer periphery engage  in corresponding grooves formed in the end member to preclude rotation thereof,   the cage being press-fitted onto the end  member for axial   retention also. Alternatively or additionally,   the  outer end portion of  the  cage may be  formed with  radially  inwardly formed tags  for engagement in the grooves of   the end member. The  main component of  the  adjuster mechanism is a  ratchet wheel  50 which includes a cylindrical  boss  51 and a peri¬pheral  radial  flange   52 of which the outerperipheral edge is  formed with ratchet teeth  53.   The   ratchet wheel  is urged  longitudinally of  the  housing by a  spring  54  of which one end engages the end of  the  cage  20  and  the other surrounds  the  boss  51 of  the  ratchet wheel  and engages  the  flange  52  thereof  to urge  the wheel against the adjacent end of  the manual adjuster shaft 24  and thereby maintain  this  shaft in  its rest position against the  inner surface of  the end member 22.<br><br>
The  cage  20  is formed  at a first axial distance with a plurality of   ,e,g.   three equi-angularly spaced  inwardly directed  teeth  55  located  so  that all   three  of  the   ratchet teeth  55 engage with  the  teeth  53 at any one  time. At another axial  location nearer to its free end,   the cam  20  is  formed a further plurality of  inwardly, directed teeth  56 which,   in the  same way as the pips 42 of the previous embodiment,  enable  the  ratchet wheel  to be assembled  through the  open end of  the  cam by resilient deformation of the  teeth  56 and be  retained  by  these  teeth following their resilient recovery.  The cage 20  thereby encapsulates  the  ratchet wheel  50  and  the   spring  54   to form a  self-contained  assembly,  as before. As can be  seen more clearly from Figure  6,  the boss  51 of  the   ratchet wheel   50  is provided with a generally rectangular opening 57 which matches  the cross-sectional  form of the  nose   36 of  the  adjuster shaft 18 so as to be  rotationally connected to  the  latter.<br>
The operation of the  adjuster is  imilar to  that described previously,   in that excessive outward movement of  the actuator tappet causes  rotation of the  adjuster shaft  18 and  ratchet wheel   51,   causing  the  teeth  53 to click over the  teeth   56 on  the  cam.     Once  this occurs,   return move¬ment of the  adjuster shaft is precluded,   causing rotation of  the adjuster tappet upon brake  retraction to lengthen the  adjuster strut and  set a new retracted position of the brake  shoe,   as described previously.    Manual de-adjustment is effected  by pushing the  shaft 24  and  conse-<br><br>
quently the  ratchet wheel   50 axially   inwardly against the  action of  the  spring 44,   until  one of the  slots  27, 28 of  the  cruciform arrangement at the  inner end of  the adjuster  shaft engages with  the  nose   36,  which now projects beyond  the   inner end of  the  ratchet wheel. The  ratchet wheel will  now have  moved  axially inwardly far enough to move  the  teeth 4 3 clear of  the  teeth 4 5, permitting the wheel  and adjuster shaft to be  rotated freely  in either direction,   but usually  in  the de-adjustment direction.     Release of the  shaft enables the components to return to their rest positions shown in Figure   5.<br><br><br>
