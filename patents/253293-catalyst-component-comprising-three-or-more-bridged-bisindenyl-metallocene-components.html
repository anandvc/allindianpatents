				<td>CATALYST COMPONENT COMPRISING THREE OR MORE BRIDGED BISINDENYL METALLOCENE COMPONENTS<br>
The present invention discloses metallocene catalyst sytems comprising several	<br>
types of indenyl or pseudo-indenyl catalyst components.It also discloses their use in<br>
the polymerisation of alpha-olefins.	<br>
In many applications in which polyolefins are employed, it is desirable that the<br>
polyolefin used has good mechanical properties. It is known that, in general, high<br>
molecular weight polyolefins have good mechanical properties. Additionally, since<br>
the polyolefin must usually undergo some form of processing, such as moulding<br>
processes and extrusion processes and the like, to form the final product, it is also<br>
desirable that the polyolefin used has good processing properties. However, unlike<br>
the mechanical properties of the polyolefin, its processing properties tend to improve<br>
as its molecular weight decreases.<br>
Polymers having good optical properties, such as high transparency combined with<br>
good processing were typically low density polyethylene (LDPE) resins prepared by<br>
radical initiated polymerisation reaction. These polymers were prepared under<br>
severe conditions of very high pressure, typically larger than 1000 bars and up to<br>
3000 bars, and of high temperature, typically larger than 200 °C. This process was<br>
not environmentally friendly as it released unconsumed monomers into the<br>
atmosphere. The polymer exiting the reactor was in a molten state and included<br>
monomers that were subsequently released in the environment. In addition, the<br>
products did not have excellent mechanical properties. It was also difficult to<br>
control the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution as the<br>
polymerisation was initiated with oxygen and/or peroxides.<br><br>
Ethylene-based copolymers produced using metallocene catalysts were<br>
introduced to the marketplace over a decade ago, first by Exxon Chemical<br>
Company followed closely by The Dow Chemical Company. These copolymers<br>
had densities of at most 0.910 g/cm3. Very low density polyethylene (VLDPE)<br>
resins and ultra-low density polyethylene (ULDPE) resins produced by<br>
conventional methods were available on the market such as for examples Union<br>
Carbide's Flexomer® and Mitsui's Tafmer® product lines. Metallocene-based<br>
ethylene copolymers were however sufficiently novel to capture novel end-use<br>
applications.<br>
Ethylene-based copolymers having densities higher than 0.910 g/cm3 were<br>
progressively introduced on the market such as for example Dow's octene-based<br>
linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and Exxon's butene- and hexene-based<br>
LLDPE. As production of metallocene-based LLDPE (mLLDPE) was ramped up in<br>
the mid- to late 90s, the premium commanded by these products decreased<br>
compared to conventionally produced LLDPE. The mechanical, physical, and<br>
optical properties of mLLDPE were far superior to those of conventional LLDPE<br>
and low density polyethylene (LDPE). Its processability on available equipment was<br>
however very poor in comparison to that of conventional LDPE. Resin producers<br>
and manufacturers of processing equipment, especially blown-film equipment,<br>
worked simultaneously to address the problem of the difficult processability of<br>
metallocene-based polyethylene as compared to the very easy processing of<br>
classical LDPE.<br>
US-A-5714427 discloses catalyst systems comprising a mixture of 2 metallocene<br>
components that are suitable for the polymerisation of ethylene and alpha-olefins.<br>
Polyethylene is an inexpensive material that can be processed and moulded into<br>
myriads of shapes with the desired mechanical and optical properties for numerous<br>
end uses. It has a useful balance of physical, mechanical, and optical properties,<br>
all of which are a function of polymer structure. Polymer structure depends upon<br><br>
the catalyst system and the process technology that are used to produce the<br>
polymer.<br>
The properties that have an impact on processability and mechanical properties of<br>
polyethylene are:<br>
-	molecular weight<br>
molecular weight distribution<br>
-	molecular architecture, specifically branching, both short-chain branching<br>
(SCB) and long-chain branching (LCB). For SCB, both the level of SCB as<br>
well as the distribution of SCB are important for determining the Theological<br>
and end-use properties of the polyethylene resin.<br>
The molecular weight of a polymer has an impact on its hardness, durability or<br>
strength. Polymers including polyethylene comprise short chains, long chains,<br>
and chain lengths in between, each with a different molecular weight. An average<br>
molecular weight can be calculated, but by itself this number is virtually<br>
meaningless. It is preferable to characterize polymers in terms of the distribution<br>
of the chain lengths and hence in terms of molecular weight distribution.<br>
Quantitatively, molecular weight distribution is described by the polydispersity<br>
index, PDI. It is the ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw to<br>
the number average molecular weight Mn.<br>
The MWD of LDPE, conventional LLDPE, and metallocene-based LLDPE differ<br>
markedly. The MWD of LDPE is typically broad of from 5 to 15, that of conventional<br>
LLDPE ranges between 4 and 6, and that of mLLDPE is of less than 4.<br>
The primary difference between LDPE and conventional or metallocene-based<br>
LLDPE is in type degree and distribution of branching, both SCB and LCB.<br>
During the production of LDPE, SCB form via the back-biting mechanism. Mostly<br>
ethyl and butyl branches are formed. The short chains are distributed evenly along<br>
every chain. Typical SCB density in LDPE is of from 10 to 30 SCB/1000 backbone<br><br>
carbon atoms. The regular SCB distribution results in excellent optical properties and<br>
a low melting point.<br>
Type and degree of short-chain branching in linear polyethylene made using<br>
coordination catalysts are determined by the type and level of added comonomer.<br>
Butene-1, hexene-1, or octene-1 are the usual comonomers, resulting in formation<br>
of ethyl, butyl, or hexyl branches, respectively.<br>
Catalyst type determines the distribution of SCB. A conventional LLDPE with a<br>
density of 0.918 g/cm3 has an average of 13-15 side branches/1000 carbons that<br>
are randomly distributed. There is inter-chain heterogeneity, with some chains have<br>
more SCB than others. Intra-chain SCB is a function of molecular weight: the<br>
higher the molecular weight, the lower the frequency of SCB. As a consequence of<br>
SCB variability, the optical properties are poor.<br>
One of the key features of metallocene catalysts is their ability to incorporate<br>
comonomer uniformly both intra- and inter-molecularly. Thus mLLDPE has a<br>
uniform comonomer distribution that is independent of molecular weight, resulting<br>
in excellent optical properties.<br>
During the production of LDPE long-chain branches (LCB) form via chain transfer.<br>
A long-chain free radical can abstract a hydrogen atom from the backbone of a<br>
nearby chain, leaving a free radical in the interior of the chain which reacts with<br>
nearby ethylene molecules to form a very long branch, sometimes referred to as a<br>
T-junction. Sufficient LCB results in formation of a polymer network. Typically there<br>
are 15 long-chain branches/1000 carbon atoms in LDPE and 10 to 50 branch<br>
points. These branch points function as permanent cross-links, thereby resulting in<br>
the high melt strength of LDPE due to frequent polymer-chain entanglements, of<br>
great benefit in extrusion processes such as blown film and extrusion coating.<br>
Reactor type also determines the extent of LCB in LDPE. Two types of reactor can<br>
be used: autoclave or tubular. In general LDPE produced in an autoclave reactor<br>
has a more complex, multi-branched structure than that produced in a tubular<br>
reactor. More LCB results in low intrinsic viscosity.<br><br>
The disadvantage of LLDPE is that there is essentially no LCB in conventional<br>
LLDPE and no or very little LCB in mLLDPE. As a consequence, extrusion of<br>
LLDPE produced with any type of coordination catalyst is very difficult on<br>
equipment designed for extruding LDPE.<br>
The disadvantage of LDPE is that, the use of peroxides to initiate the<br>
polymerisation of LDPE resulted in residual contamination within the polymers. The<br>
polymers produced did not have optimal transparency and processing properties:<br>
-	the processing capabilities were reduced by long chain branching;<br>
-	the crystallinity was reduced by the short chain branching formed during<br>
polymerisation by the mechanism of backbiting.<br>
There is thus a need to improve the processing capabilities of mLLDPE and thus to<br>
prepare resins that would combine the good physical, mechanical and optical<br>
properties of single-site catalyst system and the good processability of classical<br>
LDPE resins.<br>
To obtain the best balance of mechanical and processing properties, polyolefins<br>
must have both a high molecular weight (HMW) component and a low molecular<br>
weight (LMW) component: such polyolefins have either a broad molecular weight<br>
distibution (MWD), or a multi-modal molecular weight distribution. There are several<br>
methods for the production of polyolefins having a broad or multimodal molecular<br>
weight distribution. The individual polyolefins can be melt blended, or can be formed<br>
in separate reactors in series. Use of a dual site catalyst for the production of a<br>
bimodal polyolefin resin in a single reactor is also known.<br>
Chromium-based catalysts for use in polyolefin production also tend to broaden the<br>
molecular weight distribution and can, in some cases, produce bimodal molecular<br>
weight distribution, but usually the low molecular part of these resins contains a<br>
substantial amount of the co-monomer. Whilst a broadened molecular weight<br>
distribution provides acceptable processing properties, a bimodal molecular weight<br>
distribution can provide excellent properties.<br><br>
Ziegler-Natta catalysts are known to be capable of producing bimodal polyethylene<br>
using two reactors in series. Typically, in a first reactor, a low molecular weight<br>
homopolymer is formed by reaction between hydrogen and ethylene in the<br>
presence of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst. It is essential that excess hydrogen be used<br>
in this process and, as a result, it is necessary to remove all the hydrogen from the<br>
first reactor before the products are passed to the second reactor. In the second<br>
reactor, a copolymer of ethylene and hexene is made in order to produce a high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene.<br>
Metallocene catalysts are also known in the production of polyolefins. For example,<br>
EP-A-0619325 describes a process for preparing polyolefins having a bimodal<br>
molecular weight distribution. In this process, a catalyst system that includes two<br>
metallocenes is employed. The metallocenes used are, for example, a<br>
bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and an ethylene-bis(indenyl) zirconium<br>
dichloride. By using the two different metallocene catalysts in the same reactor, a<br>
molecular weight distribution is obtained, which is at least bimodal. As for Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalysts, it is also possible to use a single metallocene catalyst system in<br>
two serially connected loop reactors operated under different polymerising<br>
conditions.<br>
A problem with known bimodal polyolefins is that if the individual polyolefin<br>
components are too different in molecular weight and density, they may not be as<br>
miscible with each other as desired and harsh extrusion conditions or repeated<br>
extrusions are necessary which might lead to partial degradation of the final<br>
product and/or additional cost. The optimum mechanical, optical and processing<br>
properties are thus not achieved in the final polyolefin product.<br>
There is thus a need to prepare LDPE-like polymer resins having controlled<br>
molecular weight distribution and controlled long chain branching as well as good<br>
optical properties and that do not require severe polymerisation conditions of high<br>
temperature and high pressure.<br><br>

It is an aim of the present invention to prepare a catalyst system that polymerises<br>
ethylene or alpha-olefins under mild conditions of temperature and pressure.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to prepare a catalyst system for the<br>
production of polymers with controlled molecular weight distribution.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to prepare a catalyst system for the<br>
production of polymers with controlled long and short chain branching.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to prepare a catalyst system for the<br>
production of polymers with good optical properties.<br>
It is yet another aim of the present invention to prepare a catalyst system for the<br>
production of polymers that are easy to process.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a catalyst component that comprises<br>
three or more bridged bisindenyl metallocene components that are structurally<br>
slightly different in that they have different substitution patterns. They are<br>
represented by formula I<br><br>
wherein THI represents an unsubstituted bis- or bis-tetrahydro-indenyl, THI'<br>
represents a substituted bis- or bis-tetrahydro-indenyl and THI" represents a<br>
substituted bis- or bis-tetrahydro-indenyl having a different substitution pattern than<br>
that of THI', R" is a structural bridge between two cyclopentadienyl rings imparting<br>
rigidity to the component, M is a metal group 4 of the Periodic Table (Handbook of<br>
Chemistry, 76th edition) and each Q is the same or different and may be a<br>
hydrocarbyl or hydrocarboxy radical having 1-20 carbon atoms or a halogen.<br>
In this invention, THI', THI"... must be differently substituted from one another, either<br>
by the nature of the substituents or by the position of the substituents. Typical bis- or<br>
bis-tetrahydro-indenyl structures are represented in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Each substituent group on the bis- or bis-tetrahydro-indenyls THI' and THI" may be<br>
independently chosen from those of formula XRV in which X is chosen from group 14,<br>
oxygen and nitrogen and each R is the same or different and chosen from hydrogen<br>
or hydrocarbyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and v+1 is the valence of X. X is<br>
preferably C. If the cyclopentadienyl ring is substituted, its substituent groups must<br>
not be so bulky as to affect coordination of the olefin monomer to the metal M.<br>
Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring preferably have R as hydrogen or CH3.<br>
Preferably, THI' is mono-substituted with an alkyl or aryl group and both THI' have<br>
the same substitution pattern. More preferably the substituent on each THI' is at<br>
position 2 and is selected from methyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, or naphtyl.<br><br>
Preferably THI" is di-substituted with an alkyl or aryl group and both THI" have the<br>
same substitution pattern. More preferably the substituents on each THI" are at<br>
positions 2 and 4 and are selected from methyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, or naphtyl.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, THI' is mono-<br>
substituted and THI" is di-substituted.<br>
Preferably, the bridge R" that is a methylene or ethylene or silyl bridge either<br>
substituted or unsubstituted or a diphenyl bridge.<br>
The metal M is preferably the same for all components and is selected from<br>
zirconium, hafnium or titanium, most preferably zirconium.<br>
Suitable hydrocarbyls for Q include aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl or aryl alkyl. Each Q<br>
is preferably halogen.<br>
The respective amounts of each metallocene component are not particularly limited<br>
and depend upon the desired properties of the final polymers. When good<br>
mechanical properties are needed, the high molecular weight component is essential<br>
and the catalyst components having a large number of substituents is favoured: a<br>
typical composite molecular weight distribution of such resin is represented in Figure<br>
3c. When good processing is preferred, the low molecular weight component is<br>
needed and the catalyst component without substituents is favoured: a typical<br>
composite molecular weight distribution of such resin is represented in Figure 3b.<br>
When a good balance of mechanical and processing properties is preferred, all<br>
catalyst components are equally represented.<br>
The metallocene catalyst component used in the present invention can be prepared<br>
by any known method. A preferred preparation method for preparing the bis- or bis-<br>
tetrahydro-indenyl component is described in J. Org. Chem. 288, 63-67 (1985).<br><br>
An active catalyst system is prepared by combining the three or more bis-<br>
tetrahydroindenyl catalyst components with a suitable activating agent.<br>
The activating agent used to activate the metallocene catalyst component can be<br>
any activating agent having an ionising action known for this purpose such as<br>
aluminium-containing or boron-containing compounds. The aluminium-containing<br>
compounds comprise alumoxane, alkyl aluminium and/or Lewis acid.<br>
The alumoxanes are well known and preferably comprise oligomeric linear and/or<br>
cyclic alkyl alumoxanes represented by the formula:<br><br>
for oligomeric, cyclic alumoxane,<br>
wherein n is 1-40, preferably 10-20, m is 3-40, preferably 3-20 and R is a C1-C8 alkyl<br>
group and preferably methyl.<br>
Suitable boron-containing cocatalysts may comprise a triphenylcarbenium boronate<br>
such as tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl-borato-triphenylcarbenium as described in EP-A-<br>
0427696, or those of the general formula [L'-H] + [B Ar1 Ar2 X3 X4- as described in<br>
EP-A-0277004 (page 6, line 30 to page 7, line 7).<br>
Optionally, the catalyst components can be supported on the same or on separate<br>
supports. Preferred supports include a porous solid support such as talc, inorganic<br><br>
oxides and resinous support materials such as polyolefin. Preferably, the support<br>
material is an inorganic oxide in its finely divided form.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxide materials are well known in the art. Preferably, the support<br>
is a silica support having a surface area of from 200-700 m2/g and a pore volume of<br>
from 0.5-3 ml/g.<br>
Alternatively, an activating support may be used, thereby suppressing the need for<br>
an activating agent.<br>
The amount of activating agent and metallocene usefully employed in the<br>
preparation of the solid support catalyst can vary over a wide range and depend<br>
upon the nature of the activating agent.<br>
The active catalyst system of the present invention is used for the polymerisation of<br>
alpha-olefins. It is particularly useful for the preparation of polyethylene or isotactic<br>
polypropylene.<br>
The present invention also discloses a method for polymerising ethylene or alpha-<br>
olefins that comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	injecting into a reactor a composite active catalyst system comprising several<br>
bridged bis-tetrahydroindenyl components having different substitution<br>
patterns and a suitable activating agent;<br>
b)	injecting a monomer and optional comonomer into the reactor;<br>
c)	maintaining under polymerisation conditions;<br>
d)	retrieving a polymer having a broad molecular weight distribution.<br>
Preferably the monomer is ethylene or propylene.<br>
The comonomer can be created in situ by adding an oligomerisation catalyst<br>
component.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present method, polymerisation takes<br>
place in a single reaction zone, under polymerising conditions in which the catalysts<br>
producing the polymer components are simultaneously active.<br>
Many known procedures for forming multimodal polyolefins have employed a<br>
different reactor for forming each component. The methods of the present invention<br>
are particularly advantageous, since they allow for the production of improved olefin<br>
polymers from a single reactor. This is because the catalysts employed in the<br>
present invention are more effective than known catalysts, particularly when utilised<br>
simultaneously in the same reactor. This has two distinct advantages. Firstly, since<br>
only a single reactor is required, production costs are reduced. Secondly, since the<br>
components are all formed simultaneously, they are much more homogeneously<br>
blended than when produced separately.<br>
Although polymerisation in a single reactor is particularly preferred, the catalysts<br>
employed in the present invention are still effective in producing the required<br>
polyolefin components of a multimodal product even when these components are<br>
produced in separate reactors. Accordingly, in some embodiments, separate<br>
reactors may be employed for forming some or all of the components, if desired<br>
Each of the three or more bis- or bis-tetrahydro-indenyl catalyst components<br>
produces a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution, each molecular<br>
weight distribution being slightly different than the two or more others. The resulting<br>
resin thus has a final molecular distribution that is the superposition of three or more<br>
narrow molecular weight distributions slightly displaced with respect to one another.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the fraction of high<br>
molecular weight component in the molecular weight distribution increases with the<br>
number of substituents on the THI. A typical composite molecular weight distribution<br>
is represented in Figure 3 that represents the superposition of molecular weight<br>
distributions for a catalyst system comprising three bridged bis-tetrahydro-indenyl<br>
components, the left one having no substituent, the middle one being substituted<br>
with a methyl group at position 2, the right one being substituted with two methyl<br><br>
groups, respectively in positions 2 and 4. The exact shape of the molecular weight<br>
distribution is a function of the amount of each metallocene component: for example,<br>
in Figure 3a, the indenyl component having one substituent is predominant, whereas<br>
in Figure 3b, the unsubstituted indenyl component is predominant and in Figure 3c,<br>
the di-substituted indenyl component is in major amount. It is further possible to play<br>
on the number and nature of the substituents to modify the properties of the final<br>
polymer.<br>
The final molecular weight distribution is in the range of 5 to 8, preferably of from 6 to<br>
7, whereas each individual component has a polydispersity of from 2.5 to 4.<br>
The polyethylene obtained with the catalyst composition according to the present<br>
invention typically have a density ranging from 0.910 to 0.930 g/cm3 and a melt index<br>
ranging from 0.1 to 30 dg/min. Density is measured following the method of standard<br>
test ASTM 1505 at a temperature of 23 °C and melt index MI2 is measured following<br>
the method of standard test ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of 190 CC and under a<br>
load of 2.16 kg.<br>
The resins of the present invention can be used in the applications of classical LDPE<br>
obtained with peroxide.<br>
The important structural attributes of polyethylene include molecular weight,<br>
molecular weight distribution, degree and type of branching, comonomer<br>
distribution (compositional distribution), and degree of crystallinity.<br>
The physical properties of polyethylene include density, melting temperature,<br>
crystallisation temperature, heat-deflection temperature, glass-transition<br>
temperature, moisture and gas permeability, and other electrical and thermal<br>
properties.<br>
The mechanical properties of polyethylene include tensile properties such as for<br>
example strength, modulus, tensile strength at yield, ultimate tensile strength,<br><br>
flexural properties such as strength and modulus, elongation properties such as<br>
elongation at yield and elongation at break, tear strength, stiffness, hardness,<br>
brittleness, impact resistance, puncture resistance, and environmental stress<br>
crack resistance (ESCR).<br>
The optical properties of polyethylene include clarity, haze, gloss, and colour.<br>
The rheological properties of polyethylenes include melt strength, intrinsic<br>
viscosity, shear viscosity, and extensional viscosity.<br>
These properties vary with molecular weight, density, and molecular weight<br>
distribution as summarised in Table I.<br><br>
As density increases so does crystallinity, so it is the degree of crystallinity that<br>
actually determines these properties.<br><br>
The molecular weight distribution also influences the physical properties of a<br>
polyethylene. For example, at equivalent molecular weight, a polyethylene with a<br>
narrow MWD is tougher than a polyethylene with a broad MWD. mLLDPE makes<br>
therefore a tougher film than a conventional LLDPE having the same molecular<br>
weight and density. The MWD has also an effect on the organoleptic properties of a<br>
resin because the low molecular weight components are volatile and extractable.<br>
More importantly, the MWD has an effect on the processability of the resin.<br>
Major polyethylene processing operations include extrusion, injection moulding,<br>
blow moulding, and rotational moulding, each requiring different resin properties.<br>
-	In extrusion, molten polymer is continuously forced through a shaped die<br>
then drawn onto take-off equipment as it cools. Pipes, fibres, blown-film or<br>
cast-film, sheets, coating for wire, cables, or paper are extruded in this<br>
manner. Extrusion processes require resins with some degree of melt<br>
strength.<br>
-	In injection moulding, molten polymer is injected at very high pressure into a<br>
mould where the polymer solidifies, replicating the shape of the mould.<br>
Resins suitable for injection moulding must have low melt viscosity in order<br>
for the mould to be filled quickly and completely. Typically, they have a<br>
narrow MWD and a high melt index. The melt index is determined using the<br>
method of standard test ASTM D 1238, at a temperature of 190 °C for<br>
polyethylene and under a the load of 2.16 kg for MI2 and 21.6 kg for HLMI<br>
-	In blow moulding, thin-walled hollow parts are formed, such as for example<br>
bottles or large articles such as drums or asymmetric articles such as<br>
automotive fuel tanks. Blow-moulding resins require high melt strength in<br>
order to avoid sagging or shearing away during processing. Blow-moulding<br>
resins typically have a broad MWD and a low melt index, usually MI2 is less<br>
than 1 dg/min and HLMI is less than 10 dg/min.<br>
-	In rotational moulding, finely divided polymer powder is poured into a mould<br>
that is then heated to over 300°C and slowly rotated. As the mould rotates<br>
the polymer melts and coats the inside walls of the mould uniformly.<br><br>
Rotational moulding is a low-shear process suitable for producing large,<br>
irregularly-shaped objects.<br>
LDPE and LLDPE resins are used mainly to prepare various types of film. The<br>
LDPE-iike resins such as prepared in the present invention are principally used in<br>
film applications. Other applications may include paper extrusion-coating.<br>
The LDPE-like resins according to the present invention have an improved<br>
Theological behaviour when compared to conventional LDPE. improvements<br>
include for example the good bubble stability of LDPE pius the draw down property<br>
of LLDPE without concomitant melt fracture.<br>
Conventional LDPE has a very broad MWD, wherein the lower molecular weight<br>
fraction enhances processability whereas the higher molecular weight fraction<br>
enhances mechanical properties. In addition the extensive LCB present in LDPE<br>
lends very large melt strength. Branching, both SCB and LCB, lowers the<br>
crystaliinity of solid LDPE which, combined with its homogeneous inter- and intra-<br>
molecular branching frequency, makes it a very clear resin. Thus LDPE is noted for<br>
its easy processing, particularly in blown film and extrusion coating, and excellent<br>
optical properties. The low crystaliinity of LDPE means however mediocre puncture<br>
resistance, tensile strength, and tear strength. In addition, in processing, the draw<br>
down of LDPE is poor. It is thus difficult to down-gauge LDPE film and thus to<br>
prepare very thin final articles. The LDPE-like resins prepared according to the<br>
present invention do not exhibit these drawbacks: they have excellent down-<br>
gauging capability and good tensile and tear strength as well- as excellent<br>
resistance to puncture.<br>
