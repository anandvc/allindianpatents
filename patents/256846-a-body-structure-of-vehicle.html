				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates particularly to a vehicle body structure of a vehicle such that the passenger can ride thereon comfortably. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As a vehicle body structure of a vehicle, there has been known, for example, the one described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 6-48343 "Motor Scooter Type Vehicle".<br>
In Figs. 2 and 3 of the above publication, there is shown a vehicle in which auxiliary foot rests 96, 96   (the symbols used in the publication are used here and hereinafter) are provided at side surfaces of a rear<br>
cover 94 covering side portions of a rear portion of the vehicle body, and recessed portions 114, 114 are provided respectively along the auxiliary foot rests 96, 96 in the vicinity of the auxiliary foot rests 96, 96.<br>
By the presence of the recessed portion 114, the gap between the recessed portion 114 and a power unit 32 on the inside of the rear cover 94 is reduced, resulting in that hot air from an exhaust pipe 44 would not easily enter into the rear cover 94.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the running of a vehicle, for example, where it is necessary to run at a low speed in a city street in a summery season, the running airflow may not sufficiently come into contact with the riders and the riders may feel unpleasant. This is more so particularly for the passenger seated on the rear seat.  In such a case, the unpleasant feeling can be reduced if the running airflow can be caused to come into contact with the body of the passenger as efficiently as possible by utilizing a part of the vehicle body.<br>
The position of the recessed portion 114 of the vehicle as mentioned above is located roughly at the same height as the auxiliary foot rest 96, just corresponding<br>
to the position of the shoe of the passenger. Therefore, it is difficult to control the running airflow so as to bring the airflow into contact with the body of the passenger.<br>
[0004]<br>
In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to improve the vehicle body structure of a vehicle and thereby to enable particularly the passenger to ride comfortably.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, claim 1 is characterized in that, in a vehicle comprising a body cover disposed on the lower side of a tandem seat and passenger steps for the passenger seated on a rear portion of the tandem seat to put his feet on provided on the lower side of the body cover, recessed portions are provided at side surfaces of the body cover on the upper side of the passenger steps.<br>
[0006]<br>
With the recessed portions provided at side surfaces of the body cover on the upper side of the passenger steps, airflows can be passed through the recessed portions, and the airflows can be sufficiently<br>
brought into contact with the inside of the legs of the passenger seated on the rear portion of the tandem seat, so that the passenger can feel cool and can ride comfortably. [0007]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the recessed portions have a triangular shape with a width reduced toward the rearwardly upward side in side view.<br>
With the recessed portions having a triangular shape with a width reduced toward the rearwardly upward side in side view, the appearance property of the body cover can be more emphasized, and a sharp impression can be provided. [0008]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that rearmost portions of the recessed portions are connected to edge lines provided in a rearwardly upward form on the body cover.<br>
Since the triangular recessed portions are connected naturally to the edge lines and the edge lines set off the recessed portions to advantage, the appearance property of the body cover can be further enhanced. [0009]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that a tail lamp unit<br>
is disposed at a rear end portion of the body cover, and the rear end of the tail lamp unit is formed in a V shape with a width reduced toward the rearwardly upward side.<br>
[0010]<br>
It is possible to respectively emphasize the V-shaped rear ends of the recessed portions and the V-shaped rear end of the tail lamp unit, and to harmonize the V-shaped rear ends of the recessed portions with the V-shaped rear end of the tail lamp unit, so that the appearance property of the side surfaces of the vehicle body can be made to be more attractive.<br>
[0011]<br>
Claim 5 is characterized in that the body cover is provided at its rear end with a triangular portion with a width reduced toward the rearwardly upward side, and the triangular portion is so formed as to lap over bulbs of winkers provided in the tail lamp unit in side view.<br>
[0012]<br>
It is possible to emphasize the triangular portion of the body cover, and to synchronize the triangular portion of the body cover with the V-shaped rear ends of the recessed portions and the V-shaped rear end of the tail lamp unit, so that it is possible to provide a better impression design with the feeling of unity as<br>
side surfaces of the vehicle body.  In addition, the bulbs of the winkers can be protected by the triangular portion of the body cover.<br>
[0013]<br>

The recessed portion 23a is a portion disposed on the upper side of the passenger step 37, in Fig. 2. [0029]<br>
Returning to Fig. 6, the body cover 23 is provided at its rear end with an extension portion 23c as a triangular portion with a width reduced toward the rearwardly upward side.<br>
The tail lamp unit 35 disposed on the rear side of the body cover 23 is comprised of a stop lamp 91, and rear winkers 92, 92 (the rear winker 92 on the depth side is not shown) disposed on both sides of the stop lamp 91. [0030]<br>
The stop lamp 91 is a component part in which the rear end edge (namely, a lens surface) 91b of a lens 91a is formed in a roughly laterally directed V shape so that its width is reduced toward the rearwardly upward side in side view.<br><br>
The rear winker 92 is a component part in which the rear end edge (namely, a lens surface) 92b of a lens 92a is formed in a roughly laterally directed V shape so that its width is reduced toward the rearwardly upward side in side view. [0031]<br>
The tandem seat 22 is comprised of a driver's seat 95 as a front half and a passenger's seat 96 as a rear half, and a seat surface 96a of the passenger's seat 96 and a rear portion upper surface 24a of the rear grip 24 are roughly at the same height. [0032]<br>
The action of the recessed portion 23a of the body cover 23 described above will be described below.<br>
Fig. 7 is an action view for illustrating the action of the recessed portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention.  For example, even in the case of running at a low speed in a city street in a summery season, the recessed portion 23a causes the running airflow (the running airflow flows in the direction of the arrow) to sufficiently come into contact with the inside of the leg portion, particularly the leg portion below the knee, of the passenger 98, resulting in that the passenger 98 who is located on the<br><br>
rear side of the driver and whose upper half body or the like would not easily receive the running airflow can feel cool.<br>
[0033]<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view showing a major part of a rear portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the large-type rear winkers 92, 92 (the rear winker 92 on the depth side is not shown) are arranged on the rear side of the body cover 23.<br>
[0034]<br>
Returning to Fig. 6, the rear winker 92 is located between the extension portion 23c of the body cover 23 and the stop lamp 91, in side view.  In addition, similarly to the extension portion 23c in the roughly laterally directed V shape of the body cover 23 and the rear end edge 91b in the roughly laterally directed V shape of the stop lamp 91, the rear end edge 92b of the rear winker 92 is formed in a roughly laterally directed V shape. Therefore, the rear winker 92 can occupy an extremely large area between the extension portion 23c of the body cover 23 and the stop lamp 91.<br>
[0035]<br>
Fig. 9 is a side view of a major part of the rear<br>
portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the extension portion 23c of the body cover 23 is so formed as to lap over a winker bulb 101 of the rear winker 92, in side view.<br>
[0036]<br>
The rear winker 92 adopts an uncolored transparent or translucent lens 92a, so that the entire body of the winker bulb 101 cannot be seen in side view, whereby appearance property is enhanced.  In addition, the entire body of the winker bulb 101 is not hidden, and the lens area is enlarged, whereby a lowering of the amount of light is prevented, and visual recognizability from the distance is enhanced.<br>
[0037]<br>
Fig. 10 is a back elevation showing the rear portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention. Rear surface side edges 91c, 91c of a lower portion of a lens 91a of the stop lamp 91 are broadened toward the lower side, whereby the area of the lens 91a in back view is further enlarged, and its visual recognizability from the rear side is enhanced.<br>
[0038]<br>
Fig. 11 is a perspective view showing the rear<br><br>
portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where the rear grip 24 is fitted to the side of the vehicle body-frame 31 (See Fig. 2) through the body cover 23 by bolts 104 ... at three positions.  Incidentally, of a rear portion of the tandem seat 22, the hatched portion is a triangular portion 22c which will be described later.<br>
[0039]<br>
The rear grip 24 is comprised of a V-shaped large width portion 24b, and narrow extension portions 24c, 24c extended respectively from ends of the large width portion 24b.  Particularly, the extension portions 24c, 24c are located at the lateral sides of the passenger, so that they can be easily reached by hand.<br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 12 is a plan view of the rear portion of the vehicle body in the vehicle according to the present invention, and shows the condition where a rear portion of the tandem seat 22, namely, a rear portion of the passenger's seat 96 is projected rearward in a triangular shape in plan view, and he rear grip 24 is formed in roughly the same shape as the shape of the rear portion of the tandem seat 22 in plan view.<br>
[0041]<br><br>
Namely, the rear edge 22a of the tandem seat 22 is formed in a V shape, and the central front edge 24d of the rear grip 24 is formed in roughly the same V shape as the rear edge 22a of the tandem seat 22.<br>
[0042]<br>
Further, side edges 22b, 22b of the tandem seat 22 are narrowed toward the rear side, and end portion front edges (namely, the inside edges of the extension portions 24c, 24c) 24e, 24e of the rear grip 24 are narrowed toward the rear side in the same manner as the side edges 22b, 22b of the tandem seat 22.<br>
[0043]<br>
The triangular portion 22c which is hatched is formed at a rear portion of the tandem seat 22, so that the area of the passenger's seat 96 can be enlarged, and it is easier for the passenger to be seated.  In addition, it is convenient for loading luggage.<br>
[0044]<br>
Besides, the rear edge 24f of the rear grip 24, the rear end edge 23d of the body cover 23, the rear end edge 91d of the upper surface of the stop lamp 91, and the rear end edge 35a of the tail lamp unit 35 (the rear end edge 3 5a corresponds to the rear end edge 91d of the upper surface of the stop lamp 91 plus the rear end edges<br><br>
of the upper surfaces of the rear winkers 92, 92 in plan view) are also formed to be narrowed toward the rear side. [0045]<br>
