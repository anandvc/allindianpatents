releasing the charcoal bed with the absorbed elements and testing for level of said<br>
elements.<br>
The above disclosed sampling device thus provides for monitoring and investigating the level of harmful toxic elements like benzene, toluene, xylene etc. in ambient air and a sampling technique using the same. The cylindrical glass sampler filled with activated charcoal is adapted to trap toxic organic compounds present in air samples. Importantly, the dimensions of the trap tube are based upon the flow characteristics. Preferably, the size range of the activated charcoal/carbon is 0.5 -1.5 mm., the glass tube is of 5 -8 mm outside diameter with internal diameter of 3-6 mm, length of 70 - 100 mm.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder is greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments.<br>
Description of accompanying drawings<br>
Fig. 1A shows a longitudinal sectional view of the sampling device<br>
Fig. 1B shows a sectional view of the sampling device showing the disposition of the<br>
support means.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the sampling device comprises the tubular/cylindrical member (CM) which internally accommodates the activated charcoal bed (ACB).<br><br>
5<br>
The tubular/cylindrical member is provided to have a streamlined and uniform inflow of atmospheric air sample through the tube and the charcoal bed absorbent. The cylindrical shape provides least resistant mean free path to the incoming air/gas. The activated charcoal (ACB) is supported with respect to radially inwardly protruding supports (RPS) which have opening (OP) for communication of ambient air from outside to the charcoal bed (ACB). To maintain the charcoal bed compact at its sides the same is provided with glass wool (GW) plug. As shown in said figure, the ends of the tubular/cylindrical member are tapered and sealed (TS), such tapered end portion is provided to facilitate the breakage of the seal for entry of the air into the device and in particular absorption of the elements by said charcoal bed.<br>
A vigreux constriction (as shown in figure 1) was made at one end to prevent the movement and loosening of activated carbon bed, when the air is sucked through the trap. Once the activated carbon was placed inside the glass trap, both ends of the sampler were sealed by fusing.<br>
The dimension of the sampler tube is selected based on the Air Flow Rate, Sampling Time and Amount of Activated Charcoal packed in the sampler. In the sampling device Air Flow Rate of 20 - 30 cc/min, Sampling Time of 2 - 8 minutes and Amount of activated charcoal at 100 - 150 mg. would be accommodated which was as per established standards.<br>
Method of manufacture :<br>
The glass tube of 5 - 8 mm outside diameter and 3-6 mm internal diameter and length of 70 - 100 mm was selected for development of sampler. One end of the tube was sealed, to facilitate the making of three number of supporting projection towards one end of the tube. The blast burner flame was used for sealing. The oxygen rich blue and sharp flame is passed at the location of about 12-15 mm from the sealed end on the outer surface of the glass and the melted portion was pierced towards the center of axis of the glass tube by a sharp tool, to make a projected triangular shaped support (Vigreux constriction) as shown in the figure 1. The same process was carried out all around the tube to have three number of supports. Then, the activated charcoal of size around 0.5 - 1.5    mm was<br><br>
6<br>
sandwiched between the glass wool pack, so that, one side of glass wool pack rests on the projected triangular support. The other end of the glass tube was then sealed. Finally, the trap sampler was preserved in reclosable polythene bag to protect it from atmospheric moisture.<br>
Method of identification of ambient air elements using the sampling device. To use the sampling device at the collection site, the thin ends of the trap are broken using an iron file. The trap is then connected to an air sampling equipment which passes the atmospheric air into the glass trap and consequently, through the activated charcoal bed to enable the absorption of chemical pollutants. Then, the activated charcoal is taken out from the tube after removing the glass wool. The charcoal is then subjected to the analysis of various pollutant chemicals using gas chromatography. Importantly, air was sampled by means of a positive displacement pump. The sampler was connected on the suction side with a needle valve in between to control the flow rate. The flow rate was measured on the delivery side of the pump by means of a bubbler meter. Immediately before an air sample was taken, the ends of a sampler were cut and connected to the pump via the needle valve by means of a clear plastic (polyethylene) tube. Flow rate was measured at the start and at the end of each sampling. After the sampling was over, the ends of the sampler were covered with adhesive tapes and brought to the laboratory for analysis.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed sampling device of the invention to provide for a device which would be useful for effectively monitoring and investigating the level of harmful toxic elements like benzene, toluene, xylene etc. in ambient air and further discloses a simple and cost effective method of sampling of air and the like.<br><br>
