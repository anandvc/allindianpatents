				<td>SHUTTERED ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR SOCKET FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and in particular to electrical connector sockets having shutters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrical connectors such as data outlets have used shutters for many years to minimise the ingress of dust grime, grease, condensation and other contaminants. The shutter is usually biased by a spring to bias it towards closure. Alternatively, some shutters are closed by gravity. When a plug is inserted in the socket, the shutter is driven away from the plug by rotation or linear movement<br>
Shuttered RJ45 sockets can be grouped into two types: front plate assembled shutters and modular sockets with integral shutters.<br>
With front plate assembled shutters, the shutter is part of the front plate assembly, hence much more room is available to fit the shutter. Typically, shutters slide upwards behind the front plate with a spring or gravity return. A disadvantage for this shutter arrangement is the limited numbers of sockets that can be fixed to the front plate due to the room needed for the shutter movement.<br>
Modular sockets with integral shutters tend to be more compact. The modular socket cart also be fitted to many different applications, as the shutter is part of the socket itself. This arrangement allows for the most number of sockets per front plate. A disadvantage with this arrangement is the complexity of the design due to very small spaces available and the shape and need to meet strict standard requirements for dimensions.<br>
Modular outlet shutter types can also be broken down into two groups: linear push in types and rotating shutters.<br>
Linear shutters are pushed into the socket when the plug is inserted. This type of shutter has slots in its front face to allow the contact arms to pass through the shutter when the plug is being fitted. The shutter runs in slots and typically has a complicated spring arrangement to keep the shutter parallel with the plug to prevent jamming. A problem with this design is the need for slots in the front face of the shutter. The slots provide a path allowing contaminants to enter the socket. This type of design usually has the shutter recessed to meet the socket dimension requirements when completely pushed in.<br>
Rotating shutters provide a better dust cover arrangement than the linear version, as no slots are required. The problem with this type of shutter is a messy look. The shutter's front face requires a large recess with catch surfaces to catch the plug's locking tab when inserted. The shutter catch surfaces also protrudes out of the module again to provide the appropriate shape to accommodate the RJ45 plug when the shutter has rotated it to its fully inserted position.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an electrical connector with an improved shutter arrangement.<br>

Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in some further detail with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying figures. These embodiments are illustrative and are not meant to be restrictive of the scope of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
representations in which:<br>
Figures la and Ib show a perspective view of a shuttered electrical connector in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the invention with the shutters in closed and<br>
open positions respectively.<br>
Figure 2 shows the connector of Figure la in an exploded view.<br>
Figure 3 shows a spring component of the connector shown in Figure 2,<br>
Figure 4 shows a detailed view of a sub-assembly of Figure 2.<br>
Figures 5a, 5b and 5c are similar views to those of Figure la and Ib showing the<br>
shutters progressively opening in cut-away perspective views.<br>
Figures 6a, 6b and 6c show the connector of Figure 5a, 5b and 5c in a cut-away side<br>
view.<br>
Figures 7a and 7b are similar views to Figures la and Ib, but show the embodiment<br>
with a more rounded front face.<br>
Figure 8 is a cut-away perspective view of a connector according to a second<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure la and Ib, a shuttered electrical connector 10 has a body 20 which defines a socket 22 having an open mouth 24. As can be seen from Figure Ib, the socket 22 is shaped to receive a RJ45 style plug 5 such as that shown in Figure 6a. RJ45 style plugs are fitted with a hinged tail 6 for lockingly engaging the plug to its connector.<br>
The connector 10 has a central shutter 30 hingedly mounted to the body 20 adjacent the open mouth 24 for rotation about a first hinge axis 32. A pair of spaced apart side shutters 40 and 50 are also hingedly mounted to the body 20 at a point adjacent the open mouth 24 for rotation about a second hinge axis 42. The second hinge axis 42 is<br><br>
parallel to and spaced apart from the first hinge axis 32. The separation of the hinge axis 32 and 42 is such that the shutters are movable through approximately 90 degrees from a closed position in which together they cover the open mouth as is shown in Figure la, to an open position in which the central shutter is offset from the side shutters as is shown in Figure Ib. In the closed position shown in Figure la, the three shutters present a substantially flat outer face giving a clean appearance to the overall connector 10.<br>
The shutters 30,40 and 50 connect to the body 20 at body sub-frame 21 by integral hinges 31,41 and 51 respectively as shown in Figure Ib. This greatly simplifies manufacture and assembly. In other embodiments of the invention, other hinge arrangements may be used.<br>
The positioning of the side shutters 40 and 50, on an axis parallel to but offset from the axis of the central shutter 30, allows the shutters to match the specified internal dimensions of an RJ45 socket outlet as dictated in National International Standards when in their open position as shown in Figure Ib. This arrangement can also be used to provide specified internal dimensions of plugs of other standards (other than RJ45). The central shutter hinge axis 32 is positioned such that a large recess area is not required where it would be required with a single pivot shutter mechanism. Thus, the front face of the connector assembly 10 is essentially flat when the shutters 30,40 and 50 are closed as is shown in Figure la.<br>
The various components and sub-components of the connector 10 are clearly illustrated in the exploded view of Figure 2. This figure shows that with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the connector 10 includes a separable shutter sub-assembly 60 having a body sub-frame 21. The sub-frame 21 supports the central shutter 30 and the adjacent side shutters 40 and 50. The connector 10 also includes a rear contact sub-assembly 80 having a rear frame 23 that supports contacts 82. A<br>
spring 70, most clearly shown in Figure 3, is provided to bias the shutters to a closed position.<br>
The central shutter 30 is T-shaped having a central leg 34 through which the first hinge axis 32 passes as is most clearly shown in Figure la. A pair of infill portions 28, more easily seen in Figure lb, are mounted to the body 21 one each side of the central leg 34. More specifically, with this embodiment of the invention, the infill portions 28 are part of the sub-frame 21. The infill portions 28 assist in covering the mouth 24 of the socket 22 when the shutters 30,40 and 50 are in the closed position. Furthermore, infill portions 28 present abutment surfaces to assist in retaining the plug 5 when the shutters 30,40 and 50 are in their open position as is shown in Figures Ib, 5c and 6c.<br>
Referring to Figure 5 it can be seen that spring 70 is provided to bias the shutters into a closed position. Spring 70 has been designed to operate in an efficient and effective manner in a very restricted space. The spring 70 offers good closing force to shut the triple shutters 30,40 and 50 and overcome any friction caused by cleaning of the contacts but is also such that it is unstressed when the shutters are in their open position. This is important because much of the operating life of the connector will be with a plug inserted into it. A poorly designed spring will be overstressed and will fail to close the shutters when its plug is removed.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 3, the spring 70 can be punched and formed from sheet metal into a shape similar to a question mark. Figures 6a through to 6c show that Dnly two points of the spring, its end lip 71 and its anchor portion 76, come into :ontact with the body 20 and the central shutter 30. The central shutter has a slot 39 ihat receives the spring end lip 71 as is shown in Figure 5a. When the central shutter 50 is closed the spring 70 is essentially being compressed at its curved portion 72. rhis provides a closed preload bias. When the shutters open, the spring anchor portion 76 is allowed to rotate to greatly reduce the stress being applied to the spring<br>
70. The rotation also changes the overcentre point which is important to prevent the shutter 30 staying in the open position. The spring 70 has a cantilever portion 74 which functions as a cantilever spring as the curved portion 72 becomes more closed. When the shutters are completely open, that is when the plug 5 is inserted, the spring 70 is in a low state of stress as the cantilever portion 74 is in a relatively relaxed condition and the curved portion 72 has been rotated to minimise the force in this area. However, the spring 70 has been held so that it doesn't go over centre.<br>
Referring to Figure 4 it can be seen that the central shutter 30 has a pair of wings 36 arid 38 that actuate the side shutters 40 and 50. This arrangement of driver and driven can equally work in the opposite, that is the side shutters 40 and 50 can drive the central shutter 30.<br>
Again referring to Figure 4, stops 44 and 54 on the upper ends of side shutters 40 and 50 respectively can be seen. These stops engage with the body 20 to limit rotation of the shutters from there open position to the closed position. The stops 44 and 54 are specifically shaped position to ensure that the shutters close to provide a substantially flat outer face.<br>
Figure 4 shows how the entire sub-frame 21 can be created from a single plastic moulding. The hinges 31,41 and 51 are created by necked regions, that is regions of plastic that are narrowed sufficiently to provide flexibility. Figure 4 also shows abutment surfaces 28a formed on the rear sides of the infill portions 28. These abutment surfaces assist in retaining the plug within the open mouth of the connector 10.<br>
A variant of the first embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 7a and 7b. With this variant, the front face has a more rounded shape. In other respects, this variant is substantially the same as the embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 6c.<br>
A second embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 7. With this alternative embodiment of the invention, the central shutter 30 has a pair of spaced apart protrusions 92 and 94 positioned adjacent the first hinge axis 32. The protrusions 92 and 94 present abutment surfaces to assist in retaining the plug 5 when the shutters 30,40 and 50 are in the open position. With this embodiment of the invention, although the three shutters 30,40 and 50 present a generally flat face, protrusions 92 and 94 interrupt the smooth face and protrude outwards.<br>
The second embodiment of the invention also differs in that the spring 70 is more of a torsion spring. The end of the spring 70 is connected to side shutter 50. The side shutter 50 has a tab (not shown) that pushes against the rear of the central shutter 30.<br>
The connectors described above are very easy to use. A suitable plug having a hinge tail is simply pressed into the open mouth, the plug itself pushing on the shutters to open them. Once the plug has been pressed fully into the connector, the tail springs downwards to engage the abutment surfaces 28a most clearly shown in Figure 4. The plug is then retained within the connector. Removal of the plug is just as easy. All that is required is for a person to lift the tail of the plug and pull the plug out from the socket. As the plug comes out of the socket, the spring 70 acts to close the shutters as previously described above.<br>
The embodiments described above are modular sockets. However, it should be appreciated that the invention can also apply to front plate assembly type sockets/connectors as well. Modular outlets are referred to by many names including "key stone data outlets", "30 mec outlets". Shutters according to the invention can fit to any connector or outlet including data outlets, modular or are integral with patch panels, hubs, front plates etc.<br>
While the present invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments in order to facilitate better understanding of the invention, it should be appreciated<br>
that various modifications can be made without departing from the principles of the invention. Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all such modifications within its scope.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
