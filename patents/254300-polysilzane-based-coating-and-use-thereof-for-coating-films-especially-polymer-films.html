	Description<br>
	Polysilazane-based coating and use thereof for coating films, especially polymer<br>
	films<br>
5<br>
	The present invention relates to a polysilazane-based coating and to the use thereof<br>
	for continuously coating films, especially polymer films, and to a process for<br>
	continuously coating films with polysilazanes.<br>
10	Films made of polymers play an important role in many fields of industry, and for<br>
	objects for daily use.<br>
	According to the application, ever higher demands are being made on the properties<br>
	of the films. In the field of packaging materials, these are, for example, a barrier<br>
15	action against oxygen, carbon dioxide or water. In industrial films, for example, a<br>
	higher scratch resistance, chemical resistance or a UV protective action are required.<br>
	Demands for a barrier action are made in particular in the field of packaging<br>
	materials. The state of the art is represented by various processes for improving the<br>
20	insufficient barrier action of the pure polymers.<br>
	In the production of what are known as film composites, a plurality of films of which<br>
	at least one consists of a material having an increased barrier action are combined<br>
	by coextrusion or lamination.<br>
25	One example of a film material having an increased barrier action against oxygen is<br>
	EVOH. However, this polymer has the disadvantage that the barrier action of the<br>
	polymer film is moisture-dependent and decreases greatly at high atmospheric<br>
	moisture contents.<br>
30	It is possible by vacuum deposition to apply barrier layers to polymer films. These<br>
	may be metallic layers, for example aluminum, or oxidic layers such as AI2O3 or SiOx.<br>
	Films coated with aluminum by deposition have the disadvantage that they are not<br>
	transparent. The production of transparent coatings such as SiOx by means of the<br>
	chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is very complicated and is therefore<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	2	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	associated with huge apparatus complexity and financial outlay. Furthermore, the<br>
	nonstoichiometric SiOx layers can have yellow coloration which is undesired.<br>
	The literature discloses that polysilazanes can increase the barrier action on<br>
5	polymers, but the only processes for coating and curing which are known to date are<br>
	those in which the polysilazane-coated polymers have to be treated over a prolonged<br>
	period at elevated temperature or moisture content or with certain chemicals, so that<br>
	they are unsuitable for a continuous, economically viable process for film coating.<br>
10	US 5,747,623 describes the preparation of ceramic layers of polysilazanes.<br>
	Examples 20 and 21 also mention the coating of PET films with<br>
	perhydropolysilazane. The coating is cured by heating to 150°C for one hour,<br>
	followed by treatment in dilute hydrochloric acid or at 95°C and 80% relative<br>
	atmospheric humidity for 3 hours. Both methods are unsuitable for an industrial<br>
15	process for coating polymer films.<br>
	JP-81 74 763 describes a packaging material which is provided with a protective<br>
	layer of perhydropolysilazane. There is no precise specification of the polysilazane<br>
	solution nor whether it comprises a catalyst. The coating is cured by drying and<br>
20	subsequent calcining in an oxidative atmosphere. There are no details in the<br>
	examples of the precise conditions which are required for the curing.<br>
	JP-100 16 150 describes the use of a polysilazane for obtaining a barrier layer on a<br>
	polymer film. In the example described, the polysilazane is conditioned within a<br>
25	period of 150 h at a temperature of 60-70°C. This process is thus unsuitable for use<br>
	on the industrial scale for film coatings.<br>
	JP-93 00 522 describes the use of a polysilazane for producing a barrier layer on a<br>
	biodegradable polymer. Example 20 describes the application of the polysilazane.<br>
	The curing is effected in a two-stage process, first at 120°C within 1 h, followed by a<br>
30	conditioning step at 80°C and 90% relative atmospheric moisture within 2 h. This<br>
	process too does not constitute an economically viable coating process for industrial<br>
	film coating.<br>
	EP-781 815 A1 describes processes for producing a ceramic coating starting from<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	3	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	polysilazanes. Examples 27 to 59 also describe the continuous coating of polymer<br>
	films. In these examples, various methods are described for conditioning the coating,<br>
	which consist of a combination of two of a total of four possible steps.<br>
	One conditioning step is the passage through a drying zone at elevated temperature,<br>
5	which additionally contains water vapor. Alternatively, the drying zone, instead of<br>
	water vapor, may also contain various gaseous chemicals (hydrogen peroxide,<br>
	hydrogen chloride, acetic acid or amines). A third possible step is the passage<br>
	through an immersion bath (filled with water, inorganic or organic acids, sodium<br>
	hydroxide solution, amines or hydrogen peroxide). Finally, the storage of the coated<br>
10	film under defined climatic conditions over a prolonged period is a step for<br>
	conditioning.<br>
	The methods described for conditioning the polysilazane coating are firstly very time-<br>
	consuming, since the individual steps require between a few minutes and several<br>
	hours and are thus not cost-effective for an industrial continuous coating process. In<br>
15	addition, the treatment of the film with controversial chemicals which have to be<br>
	applied in a complicated process is problematic. Such processes entail high<br>
	apparatus complexity, in which the problems of recycling and of disposing of the<br>
	chemicals used additionally arise; in addition, excess chemicals have to be washed<br>
	off the polymer film, which necessitates an additional working step.<br>
20	A common feature of all of these processes is that, although it is possible to apply<br>
	barrier layers to polymer materials with polysilazanes, the curing of the coating<br>
	entails such long process times or is technically so complicated that they are<br>
	unsuitable for an industrial process which requires a high throughput in order to be<br>
	economically viable.<br>
25<br>
	It is thus an object of the present invention to develop a coating for films, in particular<br>
	for polysilazane-based polymer films, with which particular performance-relevant<br>
	properties of the films can be improved and which can additionally be applied<br>
	inexpensively and rapidly to the film in a continuous coating process.<br>
30<br>
	It has now been found that, surprisingly, polysilazane-based coatings can be applied<br>
	to films and conditioned in a continuous coating process which includes only a short<br>
	drying step within short processing times, and simultaneously improves certain<br>
	performance properties in films, especially polymer films, such as barrier action,<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	4	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	chemical resistance, UV absorption or scratch resistance.<br>
	The invention therefore provides a coating for films, comprising a solution of a<br>
	polysilazane or a mixture of polysilazanes of the formula 1<br>
5<br>
-(SiR'R"-NR'")n- (1)<br>
	where R1, R", R'' are the same or different and are each independently hydrogen or<br>
	an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or (trialkoxysilyl)alkyl radical, where n is an integer<br>
10	which is such that the polysilazane has a number-average molecular weight of from<br>
	150 to 150 000 g/mol, in a solvent and at least one catalyst.<br>
	Particularly suitable polysilazanes are those in which R1, R", R'' are each<br>
	independently a radical from the group of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,<br>
15	butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, vinyl or 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl, 3-(trimethoxy-<br>
	silyl)propyl.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, perhydropolysilazanes of the formula 2 are used for the<br>
	inventive coating.<br>
20<br><br>
	In a further preferred embodiment, the inventive coating comprises polysilazanes of<br>
	the formula (3)<br>
25<br>
-(SiR'R"-NR'")n-(SiR*R**-NR***)p - (3)<br>
	where R, R", R'', R*, R** and R*** are each independently hydrogen or an optionally<br>
	substituted alkyl, aryl, vinyl or (trialkoxysilyl)alkyl radical where n and p are each an<br>
30	integer and n is such that the polysilazane has a number-average molecular weight<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	5	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	of from 150 to 150 000 g/mol.<br>
	Especially preferred are compounds in which<br>
	-	R1, R'' and R*** are each hydrogen, and R", R* and R** are each methyl;<br>
5	-	R1, R'" and R*** are each hydrogen, and R", R* are each methyl, and R** is<br>
	vinyl; or<br>
	-	R1, R'", R* and R*** are each hydrogen, and R" and R** are each methyl.<br>
	Preference is likewise given to polysilazanes of the formula (4)<br>
10<br>
-(SiR'R"-NR'")n-(SiR*R**-NR***)p-(SiR1, R2-NR3)q- (4)<br>
	where R", R", R'', R*. R**, R***, R1, R2 and R3 are each independently hydrogen or<br>
	an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, vinyl or (trialkoxysilyl)alkyl radical, where n, p and<br>
15	q are each an integer and n is such that the polysilazane has a number-average<br>
	molecular weight of from 150 to 150 000 g/mol.<br>
	Especially preferred are compounds in which<br>
		R', R'' and R*** are each hydrogen, and R", R*, R** and R2 are each methyl,<br>
20		R3 is (triethoxysilyl)propyl and R1 is alkyl or hydrogen.<br>
	The invention further provides a process in which films are coated continuously with<br>
	a polysilazane solution. The polysilazane solution can be applied to the polymer film,<br>
	for example, by roll application, dipping or spraying.<br>
25<br>
	Finally, the invention provides the polymer films coated in accordance with the<br>
	invention.<br>
	Polysilazanes are cured in the continuous film coating process either by passage<br>
30	through an oven or passage of a drying zone which is equipped with IR or NIR<br>
	radiators. These radiators work in the wavelength range from 12 to 1.2 micrometers<br>
	and from 1.2 to 0.8 micrometers respectively. The radiation intensities are preferably<br>
	in the range from 5 to 1 000 kW/m2. The temperature, the residence time in the oven<br>
	and the radiation intensity of the IR or NIR radiators are adjusted in such a way that<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	6	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	there is no excessive heating and thus damage to the thermally sensitive polymer<br>
	material.<br>
	Polysilazanes exhibit very good adhesion to a wide variety of substrates, even to<br>
5	polymeric organic materials. Suitable polymer films may, for example, consist of<br>
	polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyesters such as polyethylene<br>
	terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyamides, PVC,<br>
	polycarbonate, PMMA or of copolymers of the polymer materials mentioned.<br>
10	It is also possible that the polymer film already has a thin SiOx layer which has been<br>
	applied by means of a preceding process, without there being impairment of the<br>
	adhesion.<br>
	The polysilazane solution is applied in a continuous process, i.e. the application to<br>
15	the film is effected, for example, by means of roll application, immersion or by<br>
	spraying. The application may be effected either on one side of the film or<br>
	simultaneously on the front and back side.<br>
	A particularly simple process for the single-side coating of a polymer film is that of<br>
20	drawing it through an immersion bath by means of a deflection roller. In this process,<br>
	one side of the film is covered by the roller and only the other side is wetted by the<br>
	polysilazane solution.<br>
	A further common process for film coating is application by means of one or more<br>
25	rollers. In this case, the polysilazane is applied to a roller which transfers the solution<br>
	directly or indirectly to the polymer film.<br>
	The polysilazane coating is conditioned in a continuous drying process, either in an<br>
	oven or by IR or NIR radiation. In addition, it is possible to subject the film, before,<br>
30	during or after the drying, to an atmosphere with increased atmospheric moisture<br>
	content. The atmospheric moisture content during this step is between 50 and 100%<br>
	relative atmospheric humidity, preferably from 60 to 80% relative atmospheric<br>
	humidity.<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	7	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	The drying process is effected in the course of a very short time, i.e. less than<br>
	one minute, preferably fewer than 30 seconds.<br>
	Suitable selection of the drier temperatures or IR drier temperatures and belt speeds<br>
5	allows the polymer films based on polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
	polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate<br>
	(PEN), polyamides, PVC, polycarbonate, PMMA or composed of copolymers of the<br>
	polymer materials mentioned, to be dried in a simple manner, and the resulting film<br>
	achieves good barrier values.<br>
10	In particular, in the case of a PET film, suitable film speeds and appropriate radiator<br>
	output allow curing of the polysilazane layer at temperatures between 50 - 100°C, in<br>
	particular 80 - 90°C, within 10-120 seconds, in particular 20 - 30 seconds.<br>
	These short processing times make it possible to achieve high throughput by means<br>
15	of the dimensioning of the drying zone. In the case of a drying zone of length 10m<br>
	and a residence time of 60 seconds, it is possible, for example, to coat at a speed of<br>
	10m/min. In the case of a doubling of the length of the zone to 20 m and a shorter<br>
	residence time of only 15 seconds, it is possible, for example, to achieve 80 m/min.<br>
	In the case of a further halving of the residence time, the speed is increased to<br>
20	160 m/min.<br>
	The process of film coating can be repeated in order to apply a plurality of functional<br>
	layers to the polymer film one on top of another.<br>
25	The inventive polysilazane coating makes it possible to improve various<br>
	performance-relevant properties of a polymer film. The layers obtained after curing,<br>
	in very thin layer thicknesses, have very good protective action against oxygen,<br>
	carbon dioxide or water vapor permeation.<br>
30	Moreover, thicker layers can improve the scratch resistance of sensitive polymer<br>
	films, for example on polycarbonate or PMMA. Furthermore, the chemical resistance<br>
	of the films is significantly improved, for example of polycarbonate films which are<br>
	very sensitive toward organic solvents.<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	8	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	Finally, addition of additives, for example nanoparticles, allows further properties of<br>
	interest for application to be obtained, for example a UV-absorbing function by<br>
	addition of finely divided zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.<br>
5	The cured polysilazane coating typically has a layer thickness of form 0.02 to<br>
	10 micrometers, preferably from 0.1 to 5 micrometers, more preferably from 0.2 to<br>
	3 micrometers.<br>
	Suitable solvents for the polysilazane-based coating are particularly organic solvents<br>
10	which do not contain any water or any reactive groups (such as hydroxyl or amine<br>
	groups). These are, for example, aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, halo<br>
	hydrocarbons, esters such as ethyl acetate or butyl acetate, ketones such as<br>
	acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dibutyl ether, and<br>
	also mono- and polyalkylene glycol dialkyl ethers (glymes) or mixtures of these<br>
15	solvents.<br>
	A further constituent of the polysilazane coating may be additives which influence, for<br>
	example, viscosity of the formulation, substrate wetting, film formation or venting<br>
	performance, or inorganic nanoparticles, for example SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, ZrO2, indium<br>
20	tin oxide (ITO) or AI2O3.<br>
	The catalysts used may, for example, be organic amines, acids or metals or metal<br>
	salts, or mixtures of these compounds. The catalyst is used preferably in amounts of<br>
	from 0.01 to 10%, in particular from 0.1 to 6%, based on the weight of the<br>
25	polysilazane.<br>
	Examples of amine catalysts are ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine,<br>
	trimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, n-propylamine,<br>
	isopropylamine, di-n-propylamine, di-isopropylamine, tri-n-propylamine, n-butylamine,<br>
30	isobutylamine, di-n-butylamine, di-isobutylamine, tri-n-butylamine, n-pentylamine, di-<br>
	n-pentylamine, tri-n-pentylamine, dicyclohexylamine, aniline, 2,4-dimethylpyridine,<br>
	4,4-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, N,N-<br>
	dimethylpiperazine, cis-2,6-dimethylpiperazine, trans-2,5-dimethylpiperazine, 4,4-<br>
	methylenebis(cyclohexylamine), stearylamine, 1,3-di-(4-piperidyl)propane, N,N-<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	9	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	dimethylpropanolamine, N.N-dimethylhexanolamine, N,N-dimethyloctanolamine,<br>
	N,N-diethylethanolamine, 1-piperidineethanol, 4-piperidinol.<br>
	Examples of organic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid,<br>
5	caproic acid.<br>
	Examples of metals and metal compounds are palladium, palladium acetate,<br>
	palladium acetylacetonate, palladium propionate, nickel, nickel acetylacetonate,<br>
	silver powder, silver acetylacetonate, platinum, platinum acetylacetonate, ruthenium,<br>
	ruthenium acetylacetonate, ruthenium carbonyls, gold, copper, copper<br>
10	acetylacetonate, aluminum acetylacetonate, aluminum tris(ethylacetoacetate).<br>
	Depending on the catalyst system used, the presence of moisture or of oxygen plays<br>
	a role in the curing of the coating. Thus, selection of a suitable catalyst system allows<br>
	rapid curing to be achieved at high or low atmospheric moisture content and at high<br>
15	or low oxygen content.<br>
	Before the application of the coating, it is possible first to apply a primer layer which<br>
	may contribute to improvements in the adhesion of the polysilazane layer to the<br>
	polymer film. Typical primers are those based on silane, for example 3-aminopropyl-<br>
20	triethoxysilane, 3-glycidyloxypropyltriethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
	vinyltriethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-<br>
	aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)amine, N-(n-butyl)-3-amino-<br>
	propyltrimethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane.<br>
	It is also possible to pretreat the film in another way before coating, for example by<br>
25	flaming, corona treatment or plasma pretreatment.<br>
	In the same way, it is possible to use ready-preprimed films which have already been<br>
	provided, in the course of production or thereafter, with a coating which improves the<br>
	adhesion or wetting of the polysilazane solution.<br>
30<br>
	The polymer films coated with polysilazane in accordance with the invention are<br>
	likewise suitable for producing film composites. In this case, two or more films are<br>
	combined to a composite material which has particular performance properties; this<br>
	is of relevance for packaging films in particular.<br><br>

	A PET film of thickness 23 micrometers is drawn at a speed of 3 m/min continuously<br>
	by means of a deflection roller through an immersion bath which is filled with a<br>
	mixture of a 20% perhydropolysilazane solution NP110-20 (Clariant Japan) which<br>
15	has been diluted with butyl acetate down to a concentration of 5%. In this process,<br>
	only the front side of the film comes into contact with the perhydropolysilazane<br>
	solution; the back side is covered by the deflection roller. Subsequently, the film is<br>
	conducted through an infrared drying channel having a length of 60 cm. The<br>
	residence time in the drying channel is thus approx. 12 seconds; this heats the film to<br>
20	a temperature of 60°C. The result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side.<br>
	The thickness of the coating is approx. 500 nm.<br>
	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 14 ml/(d m2 bar). In<br>
	comparison thereto, an uncoated film has an oxygen permeability of<br>
25	85 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
	Example 2:<br>
	A PET film of thickness 23 micrometers is drawn at a speed of 3 m/min continuously<br>
30	by means of a deflection roller through an immersion bath in which there is a 5%<br>
	perhydropolysilazane solution [prepared from a 20% perhydropolysilazane solution<br>
	NL120 A-20 (Clariant Japan) and dibutyl ether]. In this process, only the front side of<br>
	the film comes into contact with the perhydropolysilazane solution; the back side is<br>
	covered by the deflection roller. Subsequently, the film is conducted through an<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	11	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	infrared drying channel having a length of 60 cm. The residence time in the drying<br>
	channel is thus approx. 12 seconds; this heats the film to a temperature of 60°C. The<br>
	result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of the coating<br>
	is approx. 500 nm.<br>
5	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 12 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
	Example 3 (continuous coating of a PET film)<br>
10	A PET film of thickness 23 micrometers, to which an SiOx layer had been applied<br>
	beforehand under high vacuum, is drawn at a speed of 3 m/min continuously by<br>
	means of a deflection roller through an immersion bath in which there is a 5%<br>
	perhydropolysilazane solution [prepared from a 20% perhydropolysilazane solution<br>
	NL120 A-20 (Clariant Japan) and dibutyl ether]. In this process, only the front side of<br>
15	the film comes into contact with the perhydropolysilazane solution; the back side is<br>
	covered by the deflection roller. Subsequently, the film is conducted through an<br>
	infrared drying channel having a length of 60 cm. The residence time in the drying<br>
	channel is thus approx. 12 seconds; this heats the film to a temperature of 60°C. The<br>
	result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of the coating<br>
20	is approx. 500 nm.<br>
	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 1.0 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
	In comparison thereto, a film which only has an SiOx layer applied under high<br>
	vacuum exhibits an oxygen permeability of 2.5 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
25<br>
	Example 4<br>
	Analogous to 2, except with a reduced film speed, so as to result in a residence time<br>
	of 20 seconds in the IR drying channel. This heats the film to a temperature of 80°C.<br>
30	The result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of the<br>
	coating is approx. 500 nm.<br>
	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 9 ml/(d m2 bar).<br><br>
WO 2006/056285 	12	 PCT/EP2005/011425<br>
	Example 5:<br>
	Analogous to 2, except with a reduced film speed, so as to result in a residence time<br>
	of 28 seconds in the IR drying channel. This heats the film to a temperature of 86°C.<br>
5	The result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of the<br>
	coating is approx. 500 nm.<br>
	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 7 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
10	Example 6:<br>
	Analogous to 2, except with an increased film speed, so as to result in a residence<br>
	time of 10 seconds in the IR drying channel. This heats the film to a temperature of<br>
	55°C. The result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of<br>
15	the coating is approx. 500 nm.<br>
	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 20 ml/(d m2 bar).<br>
	Example 7:<br>
20<br>
	Analogous to 3, except with a reduced film speed, so as to result in a residence time<br>
	of 22 seconds in the IR drying channel. This heats the film to a temperature of 82CC.<br>
	The result is a clear and transparent film coated on one side. The thickness of the<br>
	coating is approx. 500 nm.<br>
25	The oxygen permeability of a thus coated film is determined with a MOCON Oxtrans<br>
	unit at 0% relative atmospheric humidity. The measured value is 0.8 ml/(d m2 bar).<br><br>
