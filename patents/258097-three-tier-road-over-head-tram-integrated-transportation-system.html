3        Description of the invention: Field of the invention:<br>
[001] This invention relates to road and rail transportation system more useful in dense cities with narrow roads and limited spaces for expansion. Vehicles move on three tiers, i.e., one top road on flyover, middle suspended overhead rail tram below the flyover and the surface ground level road underneath. Thus facilitating movements of more number of vehicles / commuters on a less width road by distributing traffic vertically.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
[002] Transportation is one of the major fields for growth of cities. Worldwide cities are growing tremendously placing heavy demand for space for more vehicles / commuters. Various types like higher capacity buses, trains - surface &amp; elevated, etc., are being tried out. In densely populated cities, adding more roads or widening existing roads is impossible. Here is one, the most economical system, where both road and rail transportation is used to solve the said problem.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
[003] This system integrates both railway and road, utilizing the benefits of both systems. The traffic is distributed vertically in three tiers and thus uses only less width roads or avoids horizontal widening of the existing roads. The structure generally follows the existing surface road in cities. The system consists of a top road, middle suspended overhead tram ways and underneath the regular surface road. The top road is like a flyover with all facilities. The RCC structure flyover is fully used at top, as well as at bottom for vehicles movements. The tram is unique a four wheeler Electric vehicle and is different from any of the existing types in service, has new features like compact spring suspension, motorized wheel set, Rotating mechanism on suspensions for tram removal / addition. The suspension has wide support of vehicle on tracks, takes all dynamics of the vehicle including turnings and hence is suitable even for high speeds. Two overhead rail tracks are provided for opposite directions (both up &amp; down) travel of trams. From underneath, Trams can be removed from / added onto tracks anywhere in between without any disconnections and    without   affecting any traffic.      At the end<br><br>
terminals, new type Overhead Traversers are used for shifting trams from one track to another adjacent return track. No turning around of tram or any disconnection is required and hence saves lot of time. All along the length below the trams, including the end terminals under the traverser, a clearance between ground level road &amp; lowest surface of the tram / traverser is provided for free flow of traffic underneath without any hindrance. Fire safety and other norms, as used in standard Railway systems, are incorporated.<br>
[004] The benefits of the system are: -Feasible and simple for manufacture, -Adoptable on the existing city narrow roads, traffic distributed vertically, hence no road widening but needs small lands for stations, -Most Economical: Less investments, faster implementation, cheaper operational &amp; maintenance costs and hence affordable fares. -Uses Electric powered rail vehicle and hence no pollution, almost nil noise, less energy consumptions, most comfortable &amp; safe.<br>

[024] Other features of the present embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings:<br>
SYSTEM &amp; STRUCTURE:<br>
[025] The pictorial views Fig-1 &amp; 2 show this system consisting of Top road on flyover, Middle Overhead suspended rail vehicle Tram and the surface ground level road. The main flyover is a single RCC structure with number of centrally supporting columns (1)-, (Fig-3 &amp; 4). The columns are oval in shape and are provided at suitable distances to meet road requirements. The top road (2B) is wide enough to allow both way vehicles traffic (for example four lanes) and is provided with parapet walls (2A), etc. The height of the flyover is so as to accommodate middle tier tram and road traffic underneath. Up &amp; Down ramps are provided at the end terminals. Standards / Codes of practices are followed for the flyover design and constructions.<br>
[026] Four numbers of RCC I-beams (2C) (two numbers on each side of column) are built in continuously along the length of structure underneath as shown in Fig-3. Numbers of openings are provided on these I-beams for maintenance, as shown in Fig-4. The top road (2B)t I-beams (2C) and columns (1) are integral RCC structure. Rails (2F) are fixed on these I-beams continuously along the full length of flyover for travel of Trams (3). Two rail tracks are provided for both (opposite) directions travel of trams. Rails &amp; fixings are same as those used in surface Standard Railways. The middle tier consists of overhead suspended trams, elevated stations and Traversers at the end terminals.<br>
STATION:<br>
[027] Elevated Stations, constructed at convenient distances, have all facilities like staircases, lifts / elevators, shelter with good lighting, etc. The station platform level (2E), (Fig-3), is in level with Tram floor and hence very convenient to passengers. The platform is wide enough to accommodate the length of, for example, three or four cars coupled. The platform (2E) is an RCC extended floor and clearance below it is suitable for smooth flow of road traffic (2G) underneath.<br><br>
[028] Each Tram unit (3) has, for example, two cars coupled together with vestibules (3B), like in articulated road buses. Each car has a driver's cabin (3A) at one end corner, as shown in Fig-5, thus facilitating bi-directional operation without turning around the,tram unit at the end terminals. Each car is symmetrical. Both the ends of car are tapered to cater smaller turning radius. Aesthetically designed trams have wide central doors with automatic door shutters, wide windows, well-lit lighting &amp; ventilation, seats, etc. All safety norms like fire safety, etc., as in any passenger rail vehicles are incorporated. Equipments (3C) like Air conditioners, batteries, pneumatic compressors &amp; reservoirs, electric controlling items, etc., are mounted on roof of each car. Fig-6 shows the end view of tram with complete suspension assembly (4). A pair of side buffers on the tram ends is also fitted to dampen buffing loads.<br>
[029] Electric power is tapped from an overhead top bar (with insulators) (21, Fig-3), supported centrally on an overhead concrete beam (2D) on structure, laid all along the lengths of tracks for supply of power to moving trams. The current collectors with springs (3E), two numbers fitted on roof of trams are collecting electric power required for trams.<br>
[030] Trams move in their own dedicated up / down tracks, Driver is having full view and hence can control safely much better than road vehicles. Driverless trams with central control may also be used.<br>
OVERHEAD SUSPENSION ASSEMBLY ON TRAM:<br>
[031] Each Overhead suspended Tram unit consists of, for example, two numbers of symmetrical cars. Each car is four wheeled vehicle with compact suspension assemblies. No bogies are used thereby reducing the overall cost of vehicle. Fig-7 shows this complete assembly (4) consisting of suspension assembly (5), wheelset with traction motor (6), rotating mechanism (7) and brake assembly (8). Fig-8 and Fig-9 show the side and plan views of the assembly referred in Fig-7. The complete assembly (4) is mounted on a rotating base frame (7B). The complete tram car with various assemblies i.e., wheelset, brakes, power drive, suspension, rotating base frame &amp; fixing to car body is unique, simple in design, has minimum parts and is easy to maintain.<br><br>
[032] The compact suspension assembly is explained in Fig-10 &amp; 11 with plan, end and side views. Helical steel springs (5A) with rubber pads (5B) below and Anchor bolts (5C) with spherical seats are fitted. This gives a good dynamic balancing of vehicle even on curves / turnings as well a good passenger ride comfort. Air bags in lieu of steel helical springs may be used as an alternative.<br>
WHEELSET:<br>
[033] Each wheelset (6), consisting of wheel axle (6A, Fig-13) and a Traction motor (6B), is self powered by electric Traction motor with latest technology. A low speed high torque electric motor is directly mounted on axle.<br>
ROTATING MECHANISM ASSEMBLY:<br>
[034]     The Rotating mechanism assembly, another unique system as shown in Fig-12,<br>
is provided on both  the suspensions of the car.    With this, the tram unit (two cars) or<br>
each car, can be mounted / dismounted from the rail tracks at any location on the track<br>
for emergencies, as well as adding or removing the trams in service, thus saving lot of<br>
time.    This system consists of a   pivoted base frame (7B) fitted with a segment gear<br>
(7E), a motor with pinion (7D), guide brackets (7C), positive magnetic clutch with locking<br>
pins (7F).    The Electric motor with a pinion,  fixed on the car body (3D),  will drive the<br>
segment gear and thereby rotate the whole base frame along with suspension &amp;<br>
wheelset,  on the pivot (7A).   The central pivot pin (7A) is bolted to the base frame and<br>
car roof structure.    This central pivot pin is the main connection between the car body &amp;<br>
suspension and   takes up all vertical (hanging) forces as well as all horizontal forces.<br>
Also four numbers of guide brackets (7C) are fitted on the car body, which not only guide<br>
the base frame for rotation but also take up vertical hanging forces as safety.    A rotation<br>
of about 80-90 degrees will clear the wheelset from the rail track and the tram can be<br>
lowered onto the truck (road vehicle) underneath.      The process of dismounting /<br>
mounting of the tram from / onto track is described in the paragraphs (039) to (043)<br>
below.   Limits switches fitted will guide the location of the base frame for correct rotated<br>
positions.    Three nos. of heavy locking pins actuated by magnetic clutches are fitted<br>
onto the car body to lock rotation of the mechanism during (tram running) service.    A<br>
fool-proof Electrical connection is made to actuate both Motor &amp; locking pins work<br><br>
together and this actuation is possible only when tram is stationary. A battery set provided on the tram will supply the power for this purpose.<br>
TRAM BRAKES:<br>
[035] Clasp type shoe brake arrangement as shown in Fig-13, Fig-14 and Fig-15, is fitted on each wheelset. A brake cylinder (8A) (high pressure pneumatic) actuates the links (8D) &amp; hence shoes (8C) to apply brakes directly on wheel. The complete rigging assembly is mounted on brackets (8B) and these brackets are bolted / riveted rigidly onto the motor housing. Composite blocks (8C) are used for higher braking efficiency.   In addition Magnetic brakes may be fitted for high power braking.<br>
[036] The design is made so flexible that sufficient space is provided in between the axle mounted housing and pressed wheels, for implementing Disc brakes as an alternative.<br>
OVERHEAD TRAVERSER:<br>
[037] Both the end terminals of the flyover are provided with a new &amp; unique design traversers (9), installed at an elevated height without affecting / hindering the underneath road traffic, as shown in Fig-16 &amp; Fig-17. Fig-16 show the traverser carrying one tram unit (cars coupled). Fig-17 show the cross sectional view of the complete arrangement, traverser picking-up tram, for example, from left hand side track and shifting to right hand side track (shown in phantom lines).<br>
[038] The end bays are provided with Steel girders (crane gantries / rails) fixed transversely over the concrete cross beams (9F). The traverser moves on these girders, across the bridge shifting tram units from one track to another adjacent return track. Rails (9B) are fitted longitudinally on the traverser structure (9A), the driver can drive the tram directly into / out of this traverser. Current collector (9D) is also fitted on the traverser structure (9E) to supply power for tram movements inside the traverser, as well as for traverser movements. Drive (Electric motors, gear boxes) required for traverser crane wheels (9C) are mounted at one end of the traverser structure. The tram unit (two cars) is not disconnected for anything and hence once the tram unit is picked &amp; shifted, it can be driven into service immediately. The tram unit is having driver's cabin at both ends, facilitates bi-directional operation, the driver sits on the forward end cabin<br><br>
and starts driving. No turning around of tram unit is required. This saves lot of time and hence quick service is possible.<br>
DISMOUNTING / MOUNTING OF TRAM :<br>
[039] The process of dismounting / mounting (removal / addition) of the tram at any location on the track, is the unique idea, designed to reduce time. A tram unit (consisting of two cars coupled together) is as is removed / added, as desired, without any disconnection. Removal of tram in case of emergencies or derailments, anywhere in between on the tracks is made easy by this. A road truck with a trailer is used for this purpose.<br>
[040] A scissor type hydraulic platform is fitted on this low bed trailer. The size and capacity of the platform is to suit the tram unit. Also the platform is provided with lateral (hydraulic) movements and on top, two full length side beams actuated by hydraulic cylinders, to align the tram centrally after loading the same on platform.<br>
[041] The road truck is stationed almost closely under the tram to be removed. The scissor platform is raised, laterally aligned, made just to touch the tram base, slowly the tram is further lifted up so that the wheels clear the rails on the track. Then the rotation motor (on rotating mechanism on suspension) is switched on, automatically the locking pins disengage and motor rotates the base frame at the top and after full stroke the motor stops by limit switches. Similarly other left-out three wheels are cleared off from the rails. Separate switches are fitted to operate individually each base frames for safety. Batteries fitted on the tram will supply the power required for the said operations. Clearing of all top wheels is observed &amp; then the scissor platform along with the tram unit is slowly lowered fully down onto the truck. The platform which was shifted sideways for taking the tram, is aligned centrally to the truck, by operating the hydraulic cylinders meant for it. Also the side beams on the platform are actuated and the tram is aligned centrally on the platform for further truck movements on road to the maintenance workshop.<br>
[042]    This said procedure, in the reverse manner, can be made to mount the tram car on the rail track anywhere in between.<br>
[043]    The procedure of removal / addition of tram unit is also carried out even when the tram unit is on the Overhead traversers at the end bays.<br><br><br>
