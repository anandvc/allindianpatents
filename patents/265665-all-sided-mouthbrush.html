shown and described herein, those of ordinary skill in the art who have read this<br>
description will appreciate that there are numerous other structures for connecting<br>
the template to the handle and, therefore, as used herein the phrase "means for<br><br>
connecting the template to the handle" should be construed as including all such<br>
structures as long as they achieve the desired result of connecting the template to<br>
the handle, and therefore, that all such alternative mechanisms are to be<br>
considered as equivalent to the one described herein.<br>
The operation of the all-sided mouthbrush 10 will now be described with<br>
reference to the figures. In operation, the all-sided mouthbrush 10 is contained<br>
within a resealable packet 94 from which it must be removed. The packet 94 may<br>
contain mouthwash 100 for covering the bristles and aiding in freshening the<br>
mouth of the user during and after use. The templates are also each contained in<br>
resealable packets 88 from which they must be removed. The packets 88 may<br>
contain mouthwash 100 for covering the cleaning surface thereof and aiding in<br>
freshening the mouth of the user during and after use. The user will decide which<br>
cleaning surface is desired to be used and remove the appropriate template from<br>
its packet 88.<br>
The user will now releasably secure the template to the second side 22 of<br>
the handle 12 opposite the conventional bristles 20. This is performed by applying<br>
a force on the template towards the second side 22 until the clips extending from<br>
the template engage the connection device 28 on the handle 12. The all-sided<br><br>
mouthbrush 10 is now ready for use.<br>
The user will brush the teeth in the usual manner using the conventional<br>
toothbrush bristles. Once completed, the user will then use the alternate cleaning<br>
surface provided by the template and using a back and forth or side to side motion<br>
will scrub the alternate cleaning surface against the tongue and inner side of the<br>
mouth. This scrubbing will act to clean the tongue and inner side of the mouth of<br>
the user. The user may then rinse the mouth with any mouthwash in the packets<br>
88 and 94.<br>
Once finished the user will remove the template by applying g a force in a<br>
direction opposite the connection force to disengage the clips from the connection<br>
device. The template will then be placed within its packet 88 and the packet 88<br>
will be resealed. The second end 16 of the all-sided mouthbrush 10 will then be<br>
inserted into its packet 94 and the packet 94 will be resealed. The all-sided<br>
mouthbrush 10 and template will then be put away for use in the future.<br>
From the above description it can be seen that the all-sided mouthbrush of<br><br>
the present invention is able to overcome the shortcomings of prior art devices by<br>
providing an all-sided mouthbrush which is able to clean the tongue and inner<br>
mouth surfaces in addition to cleaning the teeth of the user. The all-sided<br>
mouthbrush includes a handle having conventional toothbrush bristles extending<br>
from a side of one end thereof and a connection device for selectively receiving<br>
one of a plurality of templates on a side opposite the conventional toothbrush<br>
bristles, the plurality of templates including a template having a ridged surface for<br>
scraping the tongue and inner surfaces of the mouth, a template having bristles<br>
forming tufts for scraping the tongue and inner surfaces of the mouth, a template<br>
having spade shaped bristles for scraping the tongue and inner surfaces of the<br>
mouth and a template having a scouring-like pad for scrubbing the tongue and<br>
inner surfaces of the mouth. The all-sided mouthbrush may also include bristles<br>
which include an upper surface formed of a soluble crystal substance able to<br>
freshen the mouth of the user while brushing the teeth. The all-sided mouthbrush<br>
is able to be used as a platform for attaching various pads thereto which can<br>
scrape, clean and massage the tongue, gums and interior surfaces of the mouth<br>
with ointments, mouthwash and antiseptics such as hydrogen peroxide. The all-<br><br>
sided mouthbrush may also include a plurality of non-abrasive pads for<br>
massaging the tongue, gums and interior surfaces of the mouth of the user.<br>
Furthermore, the all-sided mouthbrush of the present invention is simple and easy<br>
to use and economical in cost to manufacture.<br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or<br>
more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods<br>
differing from the type described above.<br>
While certain novel features of this invention have been shown and<br>
described and are pointed out in the annexed claims, it is not intended to be<br>
limited to the details above, since it will be understood that various omissions,<br>
modifications, substitutions and changes in the forms and details of the device<br>
illustrated and in its operation can be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the<br><br>
present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it<br>
for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of<br>
prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects<br>
of this invention.<br><br>
