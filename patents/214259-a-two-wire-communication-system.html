				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to the field of data communication systems and to distributed two<br>
wire communication systems. More particularly the invention relates to a two wire<br>
communication system utilising a communication protocol in which an electrical bi - polar<br>
waveform is used for data transmission and power transfer over a two wire conductor system.<br>
The protocol is a physical layer protocol which defines the electrical waveform applied to a two<br>
wire conductor system acting as the transmission means The two wire conductor system is used<br>
to interconnect a Controller and at least one module but preferably a multiplicity of modules<br>
Throughout the specification the term Controller will be used to describe a device which controls<br>
the two wire conductor and the term Module will be used to describe a device which connects to<br>
the two wire conductor. In operation the communication protocol allows data communication<br>
between the Controller and the Modules across the two wire conductor by a digital<br>
communication methodology which is provided by the bi - polar waveform structure as defined in<br>
the protocol Power transfer via the two wire conductor from the controller to the modules is<br>
also achieved by the bi - polar waveform structure as defined by the protocol<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Two wire conductor systems are known in the electrical engineering and electronics fields as a<br>
means of data and power transmission Systems of this type generally known as Down Line<br>
Powered two wire conductor communication system (DLPCS) typically employ a controller<br>
which drives power into the two wire conductor systems, controls the timing of data transfer and<br>
transmits and receives data<br>
They also employ modules which draw power from the two wire conductoi and transmit and<br><br>
receive data DLPCS"s can be classified into uni - polar DLPCS"s and bi - polar DLPCS"s<br>
Most data and power transmission systems use different conductors for the transmission of data<br>
and the transmission of power However, in low power applications where the length of the<br>
conductors between the Modules and the Controller is large, the transfer of power and data over<br>
the same two conductors can give large cost savings compared with multiple conductor systems<br>
A unipolar DLPCS is a system where the Controller drives power down the two wire conductor<br>
using one voltage polarity Data is transferred between the Controller and Modules by modulating<br>
the voltage ( between voltages of the same polarity ) and current ( positive or negative ) Power<br>
can be transferred from the Controller to the Modules while ever the line voltage are higher than<br>
the internal voltage of the Modules<br>
A telephone system is an example of a uni polar DLPCS wherein power is drawn continuously<br>
from the line by the telephone which transmits the voice signal by modulating the telepohone"s<br>
impedance The change of impedance modulates the voltage and current on the two wire<br>
communication line. Digital data transfer via the telephone DLPCS usually requires special<br>
modulation techniques using modems<br>
Another uni-polar DLPCS provides for a controller and multiple modules connected to a<br>
two-wire line and supports digital data only. The modules draw power whenever the voltage is<br>
high Digital data is transmitted and received by the modules during periods when the voltage on<br>
the two -wire line is "low" The controller lengthens the "low" voltage period if a low impedance<br>
is detected across the two-wire line Modules transmit data by modulating their impedance in the<br>
"low" voltage periods An advantage of this signalling technique is that all modules connected to<br>
the two wire line receive all data transmitted over the two wire line Module to module<br>
communication is also possible The "low" voltage disables power transmission so the controller<br>
can easily detect the data signal A disadvantage of this approach is that the low1 voltage has a<br>
low noise margin ( the amount of noise voltage that is needed to corrupt the data) Another<br>
disadvantage is thai it is difficult to adjust the speed of operation to accommodate different<br>
operational environments<br>
Another two wire utility data communication system for communicating utility meter readings<br>
over two wires is disclosed in Australian patent application 64664/94 The specification teaches<br>
communication systems used to transmit consumption data from a meter such as an electric, gas<br>
or water meter to remote meter reading units The system described is very similar to a well<br>
known field known as M-BUS and provides for a controller and multiple modules connected to a<br>
two- wire line The invention described comprises a reader /programmer for communicating with<br>
a utility meter or the like over at least two- wire lines. The system described includes means for<br>
generating an interrogate signal, means for demodulating a data signal received from the utility<br>
meter over the two- wire lines wherein the data signal consists of a current in the two-wire lines<br>
which varies in accordance with data being transmitted from the utility meter when the<br>
leader/programmer is connected via two wire lines and means for demodulating the data signal<br>
received from the utility meter over the wire lines wherein the data signal has characteristics<br>
which vary in accordance with the data being transmitted from the utility metel<br>
Each meter includes an encoder which converts consumption information displayed by a<br>
mechanical or electronic register associated with the meter to a form which can be transmitted<br>
over wires or the like to a remotely located meter reading unit The specification also teaches the<br>
use of three wire communications for the system When operating in the two wire mode the<br>
reader/programmer and encoder are inductively coupled<br>
The encoder includes circuitry for varying an impedance in accordance with data<br><br>
representing the quantity being measured by the meter to cause the current flowing between the<br>
encoder and the remote reader/programmer to be modulated in accordance with the data<br>
The system is relatively complicated in the coding and decoding of the signals in comparison to<br>
pulse duration signals and furthermore it does not permit use of 100% of data transmission time<br>
when transmitting power due to the nature of the uni-polar signalling used to transmit both power<br>
and data. The modules draw power while ever the voltage is "high" The controller transmits<br>
binary data to the modules by modulating the voltage between "high" and zero voltage The<br>
modules transmit data to the controller by modulating the line current on the two- wire line by<br>
varying the modules"s impedance. This system works well when the module"s dala current is<br>
much larger than the power consumption current It is therefore a disadvantage that power<br>
consumption is limited Another disadvantage of this system is that modules can only receive data<br>
from the controller Also the communication speed can be adjusted to meet unusual operating<br>
conditions but the speed is generally limited to fixed baud rates and it is difficult to change baud<br>
rates during operation<br>
Another known digital uni-polar DLPCS employs said two- wire protocol wherein the modules<br>
draw power when the voltage is high In that system the controller transmits data to the modules<br>
by modulating the voltage between "high" and zero voltage The modules transmit data to the<br>
controller by modulating their impedance which modulates the line voltage and current In this<br>
case all modules connected to the line can receive all data transmitted on the two- wire line as the<br>
modules modulate the voltage between "high" and near zero voltage. The key disadvantage of this "<br>
system is that very little power can be transmitted and communication speed has to be fixed<br>
Bi-polar DLPCS"s are systems where the controller drives power down the two wire conductor<br>
using an alternating voltage polarity<br><br>
Data is transmitted between the controller and modules by modulating the voltage and /or current<br>
The module"s circuitry whtch draws power from the line and enables data transfer by modulation<br>
of the voltage oi the current, is more complex than the uni-polar interface circuitry of the DLPCS<br>
Bi-polar systems have a number of advantages including the ability to detect a change of<br>
polarity more reliably and with less circuitry than a voltage level in the uni-polar systems A<br>
further advantage is that the bi-polar system has twice the noise margin of a uni polar system for a<br>
given line voltage Another advantage is that power transmission can occur during either polarity.<br>
The bi-polar signal supports binary communication, and low voltage periods, as in some uni polar<br>
systems, can be eliminated<br>
Australian patent 481585 (82170/75) discloses a signal transmission system for telemetering<br>
instruments and controllers in a process control system. It is an object of the invention described<br>
in that patent to provide a signal transmission system capable of transmitting data in terms of<br>
pulse duration together with power necessary to operate process instruments The patent teaches<br>
that data transmission and power transmission are carried out alternately by changing the polarity<br>
of the line voltage It is a further object of the invention disclosed in that patent to provide a<br>
signal transmission system capable of analogue -to - digital and digital -to - analogue conversion<br>
for signal transmission<br>
The system described is complex in that it employs diodes including a photocoupler which allow<br>
current to flow forward and which are capable of detecting the flow of current As part of its<br>
operation, a signal start drives a converter so that process data is converted into a pulse width<br>
proportional to its analogue value The patent teaches signal transmission and power transmission<br>
earned out alternately by changing the polarity of the loop current Alternatively, the value of<br>
current , the polarity of voltage or the value of voltage may be changed to set up transmission<br><br>
systems for signal and power instead of proportional relationship between pulse width and<br>
analogue value a logararithinic . exponential, square or like relationship may be used for the two<br>
signals During data transmission, the controller modulates the data pulse duration in response to<br>
a change of impedance caused by the modules This has the advantage that all modules can<br>
receive all data transmitted on the line<br>
The key disadvantage of this system is that no useful information is transmitted during the power<br>
period, wasting a significant percentage of the available transmission communication time<br>
Furthermore, there is no means to enable the transmission of power during the data<br>
periods when the controller is the originator of the data The system described is said to be<br>
readily compatible with digital systems as well as analogue systems<br>
The primary disadvantage of the system described in that patent is that during periods of power<br>
transmission no useful data transmission can occur<br>
Another known two wire system is described in Japanese publication No.5003457 but<br>
this arrangement also suffers from the disadvantage that data transmission time is compromised<br>
during power transmission In fact a significant amount of time is devoted to power transmission<br>
which prevents data transmission during that period<br>
The prior art arrangements for transmitting data and power over the same two wires are<br>
disadvantaged by the fact that they devote a percentage of the total transmission time to the<br>
transfer of power during which phase no useful data is transmitted According to the prior art<br>
methodology, up to 50% of the available transmission time is used for transferring power to<br>
modules Furthermore, all uni-polar prior art systems have much smaller noise margins and so are<br>
more susceptible to noise on long distance transmission<br>
Another prior art in digital bi-polar DLPCS involves power and data transmission by the<br><br>
controller to the modules at a "high" bi-polar voltage and the modules respond using a low<br>
bi-polar voltage In this system high communication speeds are possible The "low" voltage<br>
transmission in this case can be made robust in the presence of noise because the modules directly<br>
drive the line voltages The disadvantage of this approach is that the modules use significant<br>
power whenever they transmit data and the length of time that can expire between power<br>
transmissions from the controller necessitates large energy storage devices in all modules<br>
Up until the present, the art has not included a system which modulates the pulse duration of both<br>
polarities with data and allows power to be drawn from either polarity depending on the data<br>
being transmitted. It is now possible using this system to power and communicate with hundreds<br>
possibly thousands of modules on a low cost cable<br>
Whilst the industry has been well served by standard communication techniques where power and<br>
data are run in separate cables there has been a long felt want for a system which enables<br>
communication and power transmission over long distances say greater than 5 kilometers and<br>
particularly in environments where power voltage and current must be kept at low levels for<br>
safety reasons but without compromise to data transmission time Such a system can be used to<br>
 advantage in explosive mining environments where long distances require increased power<br>
transmission but regulation requires a power not to exceed a predetermined maximum and where<br>
data transmission is desirable 100° c of the time<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome theaforesaid prior art disadvantages by providing a two<br>
wire communication system in which data and power are transferred over the same two wires<br>
using a bi-polar signal such that useful data can be transmitted independant of and during power<br>
transmission without loss of data transmission time<br>
According to the invention 100% of the transmission time is used in data transmission without<br>
affecting the transfer of power to the modules connected to the two wire conductor According tc<br>
the prior art in comparison, up to 50% of transmission time may be lost in transfering power to<br>
the modules<br>
The arrangement of the present invention utilises a bi-polar signal which has a very large noise<br>
margin As each period is followed by a period of the opposite polarity and only one value<br>
(analogue or digital) is conveyed during each period, there is no fixed timing with respect to data<br>
Also, the line speed can be increased or decreased at an arbitrary baud rate, because timing<br>
information for data sampling is passed with each transition of the polarity Further, the<br>
arrangement of the invention can support full duplex protocols on a single two wire conductor<br>
system The protocol supports two data channel for simultaneous independent data transmission in<br>
both directions.<br>
It is one object of the invention to provide a two wire communication protocol for a<br>
communication system which is capable of transmitting data in terms of pulse duration together<br>
with power to at least one but preferably a multiplicity of modules connected to the two- wire<br>
conductor wherein useful data may be sent 100% of the time and allow the designer to specifiy<br>
the power duty cycle required for the application<br>
In one broad form the present invention comprises<br>
a two wire communication system capable of transmitting data and transferring power by<br>
means of an electrical bi-polar waveform across a two wire conductor from a controller<br>
in communication with said conductor to at least one module in communication with said<br>
controller and/or data from said at least one module to said controller, the system including a<br>
remote electrical device in communication with said controller,<br><br>
wherein useable data may be continuously transmitted across said two wire conductor<br>
independent of and during power transmission between said controller and said at least<br>
one module without loss of data transmission time and without affecting the transfer of<br>
power to said at least one module<br>
In another broad form the present invention comprises<br>
a two wire communication system capable of transmitting data and transferring power by<br>
means of an electrical bi-polar waveform across a two wire conductor From a controller<br>
in communication with said conductor to at least one module in communication with said<br>
controller and/or data from said at least one module to said controller, the two wire system<br>
including a remote electrical device in communication with said controller,<br>
wherein useable data may be continuously transmitted across said two wire conductor<br>
independant of and during power transmission between said controller and said at least<br>
one module without loss of data transmission time and without affecting the transfer of<br>
power to said at least one module; wherein the system is capable of using up to 100% of<br>
available transmission time to transmit data without affecting transfer of power to said at<br>
least one module, and wherein data and power transfer are effected through the same transmission<br>
line<br>
According to a preferred embodiment a plurality of modules are connected in parallel and which<br>
are each capable of transmitting and receiving data across said conductor<br>
Preferably, when the controller is transmitting data said modules are capable of drawing power<br>
and when each said modules transmit data they do not draw power from said controller nor from<br>
other modules<br>
Each module is capable of transmitting data by putting a low impedance signal across said two<br><br>
wire conductor wherein, said low impedance signal from said module for data transmission does<br>
not distort pulse duration allowing said controller to transmit data on the two-wire transmission<br>
line to any value independant of said impedance signal from each module<br>
The low impedance signal may convey analogue or digital information by either<br>
modulating the current, voltage or duration of said low impedance signal<br>
In a further broad form the present invention comprises,<br>
a two- wire communication system for transmitting power and data between a controller and at<br>
least one module, said system including a two wire transmission line including two data channels<br>
which allow two independant bi -directional communication channels between the controller and<br>
said at least one module wherein power may be drawn by said at least one module whilst ever the<br>
controller is transmitting data on either data channel, wherein when said module is transmitting<br>
data back to the controller no power transfer is possible to other modules<br>
In another broad form the present invention comprises a two wire communication system for<br>
transmitting power and data between a controller and at least one module, said system including a<br>
two wire transmission conductor including two data channels which allow two independant bi<br>
directional communication channels between the controller and said at least one module wherein<br>
power may be drawn by said at least one module whilst ever the controller is transmitting data on<br>
either data channel, wherein when said module is transmitting data back to the controller no<br>
power transfer is possible to other modules, wherein the system includes a P-side channel<br>
allowing bi-directional data flow and power transfer from said controller to said at least one<br>
module and an N- side channel allowing bi-directional data flow and power transfer between the<br>
controller and said at least one module, wherein, when data is transmitted on said P- side<br>
channel, said controller modulates at the P- side pulse width to effect data transfer such that<br><br>
the system is capable of utilising up to 100% of the transmission time to transmit data without<br>
affecting the transfer of power across said two wire transmission conductor<br>
According to a preferred embodiment there is provided means at the controller and modules to<br>
convey data to connect remote electrical devices and receive data from said connected remote<br>
electrical devices According to the preferred embodiment there are a plurality of sparsely<br>
separated modules connected in parallel across said conductor along with one controller which i:<br>
connected in parallel across said two- wire conductor.<br>
Preferably a bi-polar signalling scheme is used which provides high noise immunity The two<br>
polarities of the two wire conductor are designated P -side and N-side, wherein, the pulse width<br>
of the P-Side pulses and N-side pulses are modulated by the controller to convey all data to all<br>
modules connected to the two-wire conductor<br>
Preferably, all modules connected to the conductor can take power from the conductor<br>
when the controller is transmitting data The relative duration of the controller data compared<br>
with the module data determines the power duty cycle for the conductor<br>
Preferably, the power available to the modules connected to the conductor can be traded off<br>
against communication speed<br>
Modules connected to the conductor can pass data to the controller by putting low impedance<br>
across the conductor The controller can then modulate the duration pf the pulse in response to<br>
the low impedance signal from the module<br>
The low impedance signal from the module does not distort the duration of the pulse directly, so<br>
the controller can still force data on the conductor ro any desired value independently of the<br>
modules low impedance signal<br>
Further, the module"s low impedance signal may convey analogue or digital information by<br><br>
either modulating the current, voltage or duration of the low impedance signal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a two wire communication system capable<br>
of transmitting data and transferring power by means of an electrical bi-polar<br>
waveform across a two wire conductor from a controller in communication with said<br>
two-wire conductor to at least one module in communication with said controller and<br>
capable of transmitting data from said at least one module to said controller; the<br>
system comprising a remote electrical device in communication with said controller;<br>
wherein the system is capable of continuous transmission of usable data across said<br>
two wire conductor independent of and during power transmission between said<br>
controller and said at least one module without loss of data transmission time and<br>
without affecting the transfer of power to said at least one module.<br>
The present invention also provides a two wire communication system capable of<br>
transmitting data and transferring power by means of an electrical bi-polar waveform<br>
across a two wire conductor from a controller in communication with said two-wire<br>
conductor to at least one module in communication with said controller and capable of<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The DLPCS according to the invention was developed for use in particular, though not<br>
exclusively in long distance mining operations where explosive atmospheres require<br>
that power voltages and current be kept to safe minimums.<br>
Due to large power and data transmission distances in mining applications constraints<br>
on transmission of power would normally compromise data transmission. These<br>
constraints are not an issue in relatively short distance communications in normal<br>
above ground operations presently satisfied by prior art technology.<br>

multiplicity of modules 6, 7 and 8 each remote from one another and which are in communication^<br>
with said L+ and L- wires such that each module is in communication with controller 1 and in<br>
communication with each other module The system is such that data can be transmitted from the<br>
controller 1 onto the transmission line L+and L- and received at said modules 6, 7 and 8<br>
Data can also be transmitted from any one module 6, 7 and 8 onto the transmission lines L+ and<br>

electrical devices and the controller 1<br>

Figure 4 shows a block diagram of a P-Side N- side line protocol according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention<br>
The P-side channel and the N- side communication channels are bi directional communication<br>
channels between the controller and the modules 6, 7 and 8. When transmitting data on the P-<br>
side channel the controller 1 modulates the P- side pulse width to effect data transfer According<br>
to the preferred embodiment of the invention, three symbols are used to effect data transfer on<br>
the P-side, namely a synchronous pulse 46, a zero pulse 44 and a one pulse 45 A reply pulse 48<br>
has the same period as a one pulse 45 The period of the synchronous pulse 46 is longer than the<br>
one pulse 45 The one pulse 45 is longer than the zero pulse 44<br>
A synchronous pulse 46 alerts all modules connected to the line that new data follows The digital<br>
data in the new data to be transmitted is represented by zero pulses 44 and one pulse 45<br>
If the controller wants to transmit data on the P- side channel it transmits Zero pulses<br>
44 and one pulses 45 according to the digital data being transmitted If a module is transmitting<br>
data on the P- side channel the controller issues a zero pulse 44 and modulates rhe period to a<br>
one pulse 45 if a low impedance is measured during the zero pulse 44 When a low impedance is<br>
placed on the two wire conductor by a module the line voltage is reduced and line current is<br>
increased as in the reply pulse 48<br>
When transmitting data on the N- side channel the controller modulates the side pulse width to<br>
effect data transfer According to the preferred embodiment of the invention , three symbols are<br>
used to effect data transfer on the Signal side , a synchronous pulse 47, a zero pulse 41 and a one<br>
pulse 42 A reply pulse 43 has the same period as a one pulse 42 The period of the synchronous<br>
pulse 47 is longer than the one pulse 42 The one pulse 42 is longer than the zero pulse 41<br>
The controller transmits a synchronous pulse 47 to alert all modules connected to the line that<br><br>
new data follows The digital data to be transmitted is represented by zero pulses 41 and one<br>
pulses 42 If the controller wants to transmit data on the N- side channel it transmits Zero pulses<br>
41 and one pulses 42 according to the digital data being transmitted If a module is transmitting<br>
data on the N- side channel the controller issues a zero pulse 41 and modulates the period to a<br>
one pulse 42 if a low impedance is measured during the zero pulse 41 When a low impedance is<br>
placed on the two wire conductor by a module the line voltage is reduced and line current is<br>
increased as in the reply pulse 43 The controller reads the current measurement 12 and voltage "<br>
measurement 11 to determine if a module is placing a low impedance on the conductor and<br>
modulates the period to the same length of a one pulse 42 if a low impedance is detected If there<br>
is no reply from a module connected to the conductor the controller terminates the pulse when it<br>
is equal to a zero pulse 41<br>
In the foregoing embodiment, digital data is transferred over the P- side channel and the signal N-<br>
side channel. A higher level protocol enables addressing and arbitration between modules so<br>
individual modules can be individually accessed However it is clear that many high level<br>
protocols including full duplex communication can be supported using the two communication<br>
channels on the P- side and N- side<br>
It is also clear that the pulse period can be modulated with analogue data instead of the digital<br>
modulation used in the foregoing embodiment In fact, any number of pulse symbols and analogue<br>
modulation of the pulse period could be supported under a high level protocol<br>
Refering to figure 5 there is shown an example of the use of a system in accordance with the<br>
present invention The system shown is applicable to transmission of data relating to a conveyor<br>
belt used for example in mining operations particularly though not exclusively where<br>
communications over 5 kilometers is required and where the potentially explosive atmospheres<br><br>
common in mining, limits the energy that may be applied to wire conductors to avoid ignition of<br>
explosive gas The system includes a controller 50 linked to one end of a two wire<br>
communication line 5 1 and at the other end, to an end of line module 52 The system further<br>
comprises a plurality of additional modules 53, 54, 55, 56 and 57, connected in parallel and in<br>
electrical communication with respective associated switches 58, 59, 60, 61 and 62<br>
In accordance with the system set up, the emergency switches are monitored for correct<br>
Operation and should any one of switches 58, 59, 60, 61 and 62 be operated the end of line<br>
module 52 will be open circuit and will go off line in view of the series connection with module<br>
52 Each emergency stop switch has two contacts which are operated simultaneously should the<br>
emergency stop switch be operated The second of the two contacts is monitored by the modules<br>
53, 54, 55, 56 and 57 allowing the modules to report back to the controller on which emergency<br>
switch has been operated<br>
Figure 5a shows the arrangement of figure 5 wherein emergency switch 60 has been operated.<br>
Two wire communication line is now open at module 55 rendering modules 56 and 57 to be off<br>
line Module 55 will send data backto controller 50 indicating that it"s emergency switch 60 has<br>
been operated<br>
While a preferred embodiment has been described , it is understood that numerous variations anc<br>
modifications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the overall spirit and<br>
scope of the invention<br>
