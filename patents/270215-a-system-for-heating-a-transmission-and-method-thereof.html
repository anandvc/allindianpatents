				<td>TRANSMISSION HEATER SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to transmissions, and more<br>
particularly to a transmission heater system and method.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] A typical transmission in a motor vehicle runs at peak efficiency<br>
when at an elevated temperature, anywhere from 25 to 90 degrees Celsius.<br>
However, when a motor vehicle is first started and has not been warmed up, it<br>
will take time for the transmission to warm up and reach an ideal operating<br>
temperature, perhaps taking as long as 25 minutes of continuous operation.<br>
During the warm up, the transmission suffers from inefficiencies such as spin<br>
loss.<br>
[0004] Various devices have been employed to attempt to reduce the<br>
warm up time by increasing the temperature of the transmission. For example,<br>
heat exchangers, bypass valves, and oil pan heaters have been employed to<br>
provide heat to the transmission. However, these devices are limited by when<br>
and by how much heat can be extracted from the engine. Additionally, these<br>
devices require additional transmission and vehicle content. Accordingly, there is<br><br>
room in the art for a system and method of heating a transmission without adding<br>
additional components.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] The present invention provides a system for heating a<br>
transmission.<br>
[0006] In one aspect of the present invention at least one regulator<br>
valve is in selective hydraulic communication with a torque transmitting device.<br>
At least one solenoid valve is in hydraulic communication with the regulator valve<br>
and the solenoid valve is operable to selectively actuate the regulator valve. A<br>
controller is in electronic communication with the solenoid valve, and the<br>
controller has control logic including a first control logic for measuring a<br>
transmission temperature, a second control logic for determining whether the<br>
transmission temperature is greater than or equal to a desired operating<br>
temperature, a third control logic for determining a currently selected gear ratio of<br>
the transmission, and a fourth control logic for overdriving at least one solenoid<br>
valve if the transmission has not achieved the desired operating temperature and<br>
the overdriving solenoid valve will not disrupt the operation of the transmission<br>
for the currently selected gear ratio. In addition to overdriving the current within<br>
the solenoid valve, the solenoid valve itself can be redesigned to further enhance<br>
the heating capability.<br><br>
[0007] In another aspect of the present invention, the solenoid valve<br>
and regulator valve are replaced with a high flow solenoid valve which directly<br>
acts on the torque transmitting device.<br>
[0008] In another aspect of the present invention overdriving the<br>
solenoid valve includes increasing the current through the solenoid valve such<br>
that the current is greater than a normal current applied to the solenoid valve to<br>
achieve the selected gear ratio.<br>
[0009] In another aspect of the present invention overdriving the<br>
solenoid valve will not disrupt the operation of the transmission when the<br>
solenoid valve is already carrying a normal current in order to achieve the<br>
currently selected gear ratio.<br>
[0010] In yet another aspect of the present invention overdriving the<br>
solenoid valve will not disrupt the operation of the transmission when the<br>
regulator valve is not in hydraulic communication with the torque transmitting<br>
device.<br>
[0011] In yet another aspect of the present invention the solenoid valve<br>
is a variable bleed solenoid valve, a pulse width modulated valve, a variable<br>
force solenoid valve, or a direct acting high flow variable force solenoid valve.<br>
[0012] The present invention also provides a method for heating a<br>
transmission.<br>
[0013] In one aspect of the present invention, the transmission has at<br>
least one solenoid valve that hydraulically actuates a valve, and the method<br>
includes the steps of measuring a transmission temperature, determining<br><br>
whether the transmission temperature is greater than or equal to a desired<br>
operating temperature, determining a currently selected gear ratio of the<br>
transmission, and overdriving at least one solenoid valve if the transmission has<br>
not achieved the desired operating temperature and overdriving the solenoid<br>
valve will not disrupt the operation of the transmission operation for the currently<br>
selected gear ratio.<br>
[0014] In another aspect of the present invention overdriving the<br>
solenoid valve includes increasing a current through the solenoid valve such that<br>
the current is greater than a normal current applied to the solenoid valve to<br>
achieve the maximum pressure and to maintain the selected gear ratio.<br>
[0015] In yet another aspect of the present invention the method<br>
includes the step of overdriving the solenoid valve if the solenoid valve is already<br>
carrying the normal current in order to achieve the currently selected gear ratio.<br>
[0016] In yet another aspect of the present invention the method<br>
includes the step of overdriving the solenoid valve if the regulator valve is not in<br>
hydraulic communication with the torque transmitting device.<br>
[0017] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0024] With reference to FIG. 1, a portion of an exemplary hydraulic<br>
control system for a transmission is indicated by reference number 10. The<br>
hydraulic control system 10 is preferably employed in an automatic transmission<br>
having a park, a neutral, and a plurality of forward and reverse gear ratios. Each<br>
gear ratio is selected by engaging a combination of torque transmitting devices.<br>
These torque transmitting devices may take the form of clutches or brakes. The<br>
hydraulic control system 10 actuates or controls these torque transmitting<br><br>
devices within the transmission by regulating the hydraulic line pressure to these<br>
devices. In addition to controlling these devices, the hydraulic control system 10<br>
provides lubrication and cooling fluids to various components of the transmission<br>
system. In the particular example provided, the hydraulic control system 10<br>
provides hydraulic fluid to at least one actuatable device 11. The actuatable<br>
device 11 may take many forms, including a shift valve coupled to a torque<br>
transmitting device such as a friction clutch or brake, or any other device<br>
commonly found in a transmission hydraulic circuit.<br>
[0025] The hydraulic control system 10 generally includes a hydraulic<br>
circuit 12. The hydraulic circuit 12 includes a plurality of passages or lines 14<br>
that are used to transport pressurized hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic fluid source<br>
(not shown), such as a pump, to the various components of the transmission,<br>
including the actuatable device 11. The hydraulic fluid may also be used for<br>
lubrication and for cooling.<br>
[0026] At least one regulator valve 15 is located within the hydraulic<br>
circuit 12. The regulator valve 15 includes a shaft 16 having a plurality of lands<br>
18 mounted thereon. The regulator valve 15 is operable to restrict or allow the<br>
passage of hydraulic fluid to the actuatable device 11 by moving between various<br>
positions within the hydraulic circuit 12. For each position, the regulator valve 15<br>
controls the passage of hydraulic fluid through the regulator valve 15, as will be<br>
described in greater detail below. The regulator valve 12 is biased to one of<br>
these positions by a biasing member 20.<br><br>
[0027] At least one solenoid valve 26 is located within the hydraulic<br>
circuit 12. The solenoid valve 26 is in communication with a feeder line 28 that<br>
carries a pressurized hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic fluid source (not shown) to<br>
the regulator valve 15. The solenoid valve 26 is an electrically actuated valve<br>
that controls the line pressure of the hydraulic fluid downstream of the solenoid<br>
valve 26 by selectively inhibiting the flow of the hydraulic fluid through the<br>
solenoid valve 26. When the solenoid valve 26 is open, line pressure<br>
downstream of the solenoid valve 26 is at a maximum (approximately 130 psi for<br>
a typical six-speed transmission) and equal to the supply pressure from the<br>
hydraulic fluid source. When the solenoid valve 26 is closed, line pressure<br>
downstream of the solenoid valve 26 is at a minimum (typically zero psi). The<br>
solenoid valve 26 is actuated by an electrical current and is either a normally<br>
open or normally closed solenoid valve. The normally open solenoid valve<br>
provides maximum downstream pressure (the solenoid valve is open and not<br>
restricting fluid flow therethrough) when the current to the solenoid valve is zero.<br>
The normally open solenoid is also commonly referred to as a normally high<br>
solenoid valve. Applying current to the normally open solenoid valve restricts or<br>
closes the solenoid valve, thereby reducing downstream line pressure. The<br>
normally closed solenoid valve provides minimum downstream pressure (the<br>
solenoid valve is closed and restricting fluid flow therethrough) when the current<br>
to the solenoid valve is zero. The normally closed solenoid is also commonly<br>
referred to as a normally low solenoid valve. Applying current to the normally<br>
closed solenoid valve opens the solenoid valve, thereby increasing downstream<br><br>
pressure. Moreover, the solenoid valve may take various forms, such as a<br>
variable bleed solenoid valve (VBS), a variable force solenoid valve (VFS), an<br>
on/off solenoid valve, a pulse width modulated valve, or a direct acting/high flow<br>
solenoid valve. A VBS or VFS solenoid valve is operable to regulate<br>
downstream pressure through a range of values based on the current provided to<br>
the solenoid valve. An on/off solenoid valve is either fully opened or fully closed.<br>
[0028] A controller 30 is in electrical communication with the solenoid<br>
valve 26. The controller 30 may be an engine controller or transmission<br>
controller, or any other electronic device having a preprogrammed digital<br>
computer or processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least<br>
one I/O section. The control logic includes a plurality of logic routines for<br>
monitoring, manipulating, and generating data. The controller 30 is also in<br>
communication with various sensors coupled to the transmission and engine,<br>
such as temperature sensors.<br>
[0029] It should be appreciated that while only one regulator valve 15,<br>
one solenoid valve 26, and one actuatable device 11 have been illustrated, the<br>
transmission may include a plurality of these devices coupled together to form a<br>
complete control circuit operable to provide a plurality of gear ratios.<br>
Accordingly, the number of regulating valves 15, the number and type of solenoid<br>
valves 26, and the number and type of actuatable devices 11, as well as the<br>
arrangement of lines 14, will vary with the type of transmission. For example, in<br>
a 6-speed automatic transmission, the complete hydraulic control system 10 may<br>
include seven VBS solenoid valves including a line VBS solenoid valve and a<br><br>
torque converter clutch solenoid valve, and two on/off solenoid valves, all<br>
controlling five clutches.<br>
[0030] Additionally, the actuatable device 11 can by directly<br>
hydraulically actuated by a high flow version of the solenoid valve 26. The high<br>
flow solenoid valve 26 replaces the regulator valve 15 and directly controls the<br>
pressure and flow to the torque transferring device 11.<br>
[0031] During operation of the hydraulic control system 10 specific gear<br>
ratios require that certain combinations of torque transmitting devices be<br>
actuated. Accordingly, in order to actuate the actuatable device 11, pressurized<br>
fluid must be delivered through the hydraulic circuit 12 to the actuatable device<br>
11. This is accomplished by actuating the regulator valve 15 to a specified open<br>
position such that the lands 18 of the regulator valve 12 do not block the lines 14<br>
that feed the actuatable device 11. In the example provided, the regulator valve<br>
15 is actuated to the open position when a pressurized hydraulic fluid in the<br>
feeder line 28 is allowed to pass through the solenoid valve 26 such that the<br>
pressurized fluid engages the regulator valve 15 and moves the regulator valve<br>
15 against the biasing member 20. Accordingly, pressurized fluid is delivered to<br>
the regulator valve 15 when the solenoid valve 26 is in the open position. In the<br>
case of a normally open solenoid valve, this occurs when the solenoid valve 26<br>
has not been energized by a current. In the case of a normally closed solenoid<br>
valve, this occurs when the solenoid valve 26 has been energized by a current.<br>
In either case, the controller 30 controls the actuation of the solenoid valve 26<br><br>
using predefined and appropriate control logic based on the types of solenoid<br>
valves and positions of the regulator valves.<br>
[0032] With reference to FIG. 2, a method for heating a transmission<br>
employing the hydraulic control system 10 is illustrated in flow-chart form and<br>
indicated by reference number 100. The method 100 will be described using one<br>
regulator valve 15 and one solenoid valve 26 for exemplary purposes, however, it<br>
should be appreciated that the method 100 may employ as many of the regulator<br>
valves 15 and the solenoid valves 26 that are within the transmission. The<br>
method 100 begins at step 102 when the motor vehicle engine is first started.<br>
Then, the controller 30 reads the current temperature of the transmission at step<br>
104 from one or more temperature sensors located throughout the transmission.<br>
[0033] At step 106, the controller compares the current temperature of<br>
the transmission to a desired operating temperature. The desired operating<br>
temperature is a pre-defined set value, and may vary between applications, for<br>
example ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius). If the<br>
current temperature is greater than or equal to the desired operating<br>
temperature, then the method 100 proceeds to step 108 where normal<br>
transmission operation continues.<br>
[0034] If the current temperature is less than the desired operating<br>
temperature, the method proceeds to step 110 where a solenoid valve heating<br>
control logic routine begins. The solenoid valve heating control logic at step 110<br>
serves to selectively overdrive specific solenoid valves without affecting the<br>
normal operation of the transmission. By overdriving the solenoid valves, the<br><br>
solenoid valves give off excess heat that is transmitted to the hydraulic fluid.<br>
This in turn rapidly increases the current operating temperature of the<br>
transmission. During the solenoid valve heating logic routine at step 110, the<br>
method continues to repeat steps 104 and 106. When the current transmission<br>
temperature achieves the desired operating temperature, the solenoid valve<br>
heating logic routine 110 terminates and the method proceeds to step 108 where<br>
the transmission operates normally.<br>
[0035] Turning now to FIG. 3, the solenoid valve heating logic routine<br>
110 will be described in further detail. The solenoid valve heating logic routine<br>
begins at step 112 where the controller 30 determines the currently selected gear<br>
ratio of the transmission. Next, the controller 30 uses the currently selected gear<br>
ratio to determine whether the solenoid valve 26 is being energized at full normal<br>
current. If the solenoid valve 26 is being energized at full normal current, the<br>
solenoid valve 26 is overdriven at step 116. The solenoid valve 26 is overdriven<br>
by preferably increasing the current through the solenoid valve 26 to a value<br>
greater than the full current applied to the solenoid valve 26 to achieve the<br>
selected gear ratio. As most solenoid valves are designed to carry currents<br>
greater than the full normal current used to achieve the selected gear ratio,<br>
overdriving the solenoid valve will not damage the solenoid valve or the<br>
transmission. In the particular example provided, the solenoid valve 26 is<br>
overdriven by doubling the full normal current, though various levels of current<br>
may be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. As<br>
the current is increased through the solenoid valve 26, resistance heating occurs,<br><br>
and the current operating temperature of the transmission increases.<br>
Alternatively, rather than increasing the current through the solenoid valve 26,<br>
the resistance of the solenoid valve 26 may be increased. However some<br>
solenoid valves 26 may be redesigned to enable this feature and withstand the<br>
higher currents and further enhance the desired heating characteristics.<br>
[0036] If the solenoid valve 26 is not at full normal current for the given<br>
gear ratio, then the controller 30 then determines whether the regulator valve 15<br>
that is actuated by the solenoid valve 26 is hydraulically isolated for the given<br>
gear ratio. The regulator valve 15 is hydraulically isolated when the regulator<br>
valve is not in hydraulic communication with the torque transmitting device even<br>
if the regulator valve 15 is in an open position such that the lines 14 are not<br>
closed off by the lands 18 of the regulator valve 15. Hydraulic isolation of the<br>
regulator valve 15 can occur due to the positions of various other shift valves,<br>
regulator valves or solenoid valves within the hydraulic circuit 12 upstream of the<br>
regulator valve 15. If the regulator valve 15 is hydraulically isolated, then<br>
overdriving the solenoid valve 26 will not affect the actuatable device 11, and the<br>
solenoid valve heating logic routine 110 proceeds to step 116 where the solenoid<br>
valve 26 is overdriven.<br>
[0037] If the regulator valve 15 is not hydraulically isolated, then the<br>
solenoid valve heating logic routine 110 repeats. Over time, the current gear<br>
ratio may change and solenoid valves may become fully energized or regulator<br>
valves may become hydraulically isolated, thus allowing specific solenoid valves<br>
to be overdriven.<br><br>
[0038] With reference to FIG. 4, an exemplary solenoid valve heating<br>
chart is shown for a six-speed transmission. For each given gear ratio, a specific<br>
solenoid valve is indicated whether it can be overdriven. Additionally, for each<br>
solenoid valve and each gear ratio, a specific controlling limitation or factor is<br>
listed. These limitations are used to help determine when the solenoid valve may<br>
be overdriven.<br>
[0039] For example, in neutral, the solenoid valve labeled C1 VBS is<br>
limited in that it is a normally closed solenoid valve and controls a valve that is<br>
hydraulically isolated when the current gear ratio is neutral. Accordingly, C1 VBS<br>
may be overdriven. The solenoid valve labeled C2/C5 VBS is limited in that it is<br>
a normally open solenoid valve and the solenoid valve is controlling (i.e., the<br>
solenoid valve is open and providing pressurized fluid to the respective regulator<br>
valve). Accordingly, the C2/C5 VBS is not at full current and cannot be<br>
overdriven when in neutral. The solenoid valve labeled C3 VBS is limited in that<br>
it is a normally open solenoid valve and the solenoid valve is off (i.e. the solenoid<br>
valve is closed and restricting pressurized fluid from passing to the respective<br>
regulator valve). Therefore, the C3 VBS is at full current and may be overdriven.<br>
The solenoid valve labeled C4 VBS is limited in that it is a normally closed<br>
solenoid valve and controls a valve that is hydraulically isolated when the current<br>
gear ratio is neutral. Accordingly, C4 VBS may be overdriven. The solenoid<br>
valve labeled Line VBS is a normally open solenoid valve is limited in that it may<br>
only be overdriven when minimum line pressure downstream of the solenoid<br>
valve is desired. The solenoid valve labeled TCC VBS is limited in that it may<br><br>
only be overdriven when the transmission will not be starved of cooler or<br>
lubrication fluids by overdriving the solenoid valve (lube dependent) and the<br>
regulator valve is hydraulically isolated (no TCC Apply). The solenoid valves<br>
labeled Solenoid valve 2 and Solenoid valve 3 are on/off solenoid valves and<br>
may be overdriven when in the "on" position (e.g. the solenoid valves are at full<br>
current).<br>
[0040] In first gear, the C1 VBS is limited in that it is a normally closed<br>
solenoid valve and may be overdriven when the correspondingly controlled clutch<br>
has already been applied. The C2/C5 VBS is limited in that it is a normally open<br>
solenoid valve and the solenoid valve is controlling (i.e., the solenoid valve is<br>
open and providing pressurized fluid to the respective regulator valve).<br>
Accordingly, the C2/C5 VBS is not at full current and cannot be overdriven when<br>
in first gear. The C3 VBS is limited in that it is a normally open solenoid valve<br>
and the solenoid valve is off (i.e. the solenoid valve is closed and restricting<br>
pressurized fluid from passing to the respective regulator valve). Therefore, the<br>
C3 VBS is at full current and may be overdriven. The C4 VBS is limited in that it<br>
is a normally closed solenoid valve and the solenoid valve is off (i.e. the solenoid<br>
valve is closed and restricting pressurized fluid from passing to the respective<br>
regulator valve). Accordingly, C4 VBS may not be overdriven. The Line VBS is a<br>
normally open solenoid valve is limited in that it may only be overdriven when<br>
minimum line pressure downstream of the solenoid valve is desired. The TCC<br>
VBS is limited in that it may only be overdriven when the torque converter clutch<br>
is already fully applied or locked and accordingly the solenoid valve may be<br><br>
overdriven without affecting the engagement of the torque converter clutch. The<br>
Solenoid valve 2 may be overdriven when the torque converter clutch is fully<br>
applied or locked or when the torque converter clutch is off. Solenoid valve 3<br>
may be overdriven when in the "on" position (e.g. the solenoid valves are at full<br>
current). The remaining gear ratios follow a similar pattern as illustrated in the<br>
chart.<br>
[0041] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
