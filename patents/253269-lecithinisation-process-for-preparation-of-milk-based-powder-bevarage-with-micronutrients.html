US Patent No. 5,480,661 teaches Vitamin A and D additive for milk products wherein an oil-based vitamin A and Vitamin D preparation having a specific gravity greater than 1.0 used to fortify milk products. The preparation contains vitamin A palmitate, Vitamin D.sub.3 resin, ester gum and/or brominated vegetable oil, corn oil, polysorbate 80, and triglycerol monooleate. The preparation is added to the milk product any time during processing and remains dispersed in the milk phase during centrifugal separation. The preparation is concentrated, resists oxidation, and does not require refrigeration.<br>
US Patent No. 5,906,847 discloses milk substitute prepared with whey or whey and added lactose wherein a milk substitute composition is prepared with whey solids or whey solids and added lactose by dissolving a whey solids powder in an aqueous medium containing calcium sequestering agent and carrageenate components at a temperature of approximately from 30°C to 65 °C and then, in a second step, at the same temperature, a skimmed milk solids powder is dissolved in the whey-containing medium, and before and/or after dissolving the skimmed milk solids powder, the whey solids are allowed to soak in the aqueous liquid phase of the composition so prepared for from 10 minutes to 4 hours for hydrating the whey solids. When lactose is used, the amount of whey solids powder employed may be reduced by about half.<br>
Further in the said document a process for preparing a milk substitute composition is described by dissolving a whey solids powder in an aqueous medium comprising calcium sequestering agent and carrageenate components at a temperature of approximately from 30°C to 65°C to obtain a whey-containing medium having an aqueous liquid phase; dissolving a skimmed milk solids powder in the whey-containing medium at a temperature of approximately from 30°C to 65°C to obtain a milk substitute composition having an aqueous liquid phase; and allowing, before and/or after dissolving the skimmed milk solids powder, the whey solids to soak in the aqueous liquid phase for from 10 minutes to 4 hours for hydrating the whey solids.<br>
US Patent No. 5,907,031 describes milk whey protein-containing powder and process food<br><br>
obtained by using the same wherein the process is described in which a solution of milk whey protein is reacted with a transglutaminase, heated, and then dried. The resulting milk whey protein composition, and food products containing the resulting milk whey protein composition are also described. The milk whey protein composition has an excellent taste and imparts a smooth and pleasant feel on the palate.<br>
US Patent No. 6,423,335 discloses modified milk powder composition wherein the composition comprising modified milk powder, and glutamine and/or a peptide containing glutamine, wherein the glutamine and/or a peptide containing glutamine is contained at an amount of from 5 to 170% by weight calculated as glutamine based on protein weight in the modified milk powder, and wherein the peptide containing glutamine has a molecular weight of 2000 or less and contains glutamine in an amount of 20% or more of the total amino acid residues in the peptide.<br>
US Patent No. 6,592,927 discloses skimmed milk powder substitute wherein it comprises an intimate mixture of protein and a non-fermentable sweetening and/or bulking agent. The powder includes 0-40 weight parts of lactose and 0-10 weight parts offatper 100 weight parts of protein. The powder is prepared by forming an aqueous solution or dispersion of the components including protein and the sweetening/bulking agent followed by drying, e.g. by spray drying. The skimmed milk powder substitute is useful as an ingredient in the manufacture of food, in particular chocolate.<br>
US Patent No. 6,635,302 teaches milk protein dispersions wherein soluble sugar can be added to milk protein dispersion with reduced lactose to slow viscosity buildup and gelation. Preferably, greater than about 3 percent by weight soluble sugar is added to the milk protein dispersion. The resulting milk protein dispersion generally has greater than about 6 percent by weight protein, less than about 20 percent by weight lactose and greater than about 3 percent by weight soluble sugar. Preferred milk protein dispersions are low fat. The milk protein dispersions are suitable for storage for at least several days without viscosity build-ups that inhibit processing<br>
A stabilized concentrated aqueous milk protein dispersion comprising a milk protein dispersion concentrated by removing fat and lactose from a milk composition and concentrating the milk<br><br>
composition to increase the protein concentration by from about a 4-fold increase to an about 5.5-fold increase, and greater than about 3 percent by weight added soluble polyol, soluble sugar, or a combination thereof, wherein the weight ratio of sugar to protein of the stabilized concentrated aqueous milk protein dispersion is 1.25 or less.<br>
US Patent No. 7,150,893 describes milk beverage comprises a polyglycerol fatty acid ester having a cloud point of not less than 90°C when measured at a concentration of 1% by weight in a 20% sodium chloride aqueous solution containing said ester wherein the amount of polyglycerol ratty acid ester is 0.01 to 0.1% by weight and the weight ratio of said polyglycerol fatty acid ester to said sucrose ratty acid ester is 1:1 to 7:3.<br>
Further it is observed in the prior art that the method of producing milk based powder beverage with micronutrients comprises of Whole Milk Powder (WMP), Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC), Maltodextrin Vitamin Mixture and Mineral Mixture after sieving and mixing thoroughly in dry mixing in ribbon mixer for 60 minutes followed by spraying of oils comprises of Groundnut Oil (GNO), Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil, Ghee and L-Ascorbyl Palmitate in the said mixer for 20 minutes followed by filling, packing and transporting the final product.<br>
According to the prior art process and product described above, it is felt that no such improved methods have been suggested to improve the appearance of the milk based powder beverage with micronutrients. In addition to the enhanced nutritious value to meet the demand of the customers in the present era.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for a method for preparation of the milk based powder beverage with micronutrients, vitamins and minerals with oil lecithin mixture to improve the appearance and nutritious value during the shelf life of the product.<br>
PROCESS OF LECITHINISATION : -<br>
Liquid lecithin is added to beverage based on milk powder &amp; conventional rat with an intention to prevent floating of fat after reconstituting the beverage with water.<br><br>
Fat separation leads to following discrepancies,<br>
a)	Poor appearance of the reconstituted beverage.<br>
b)	Uneven distribution of nutrients as fat &amp; fat-soluble nutrients separates out.<br>
Conventional lecithinisation: -<br>
a)	Lecithin is added to fat / oil ingredients of the formula to make oil lecithin base.<br>
b)	Above oil lecithin base is mixed with remaining powder ingredients.<br>
c)	Upon reconstituting with water, oil does not separate out from the beverage.<br>
Disadvantages of Conventional lecithinisation: -<br>
a)	Appearance of final beverage powder becomes oily &amp; sticky. Product does not look like as if it is based on milk powder.<br>
b)	Colour of the powder appears darker than milk powder<br>
Modified process of lecithinisation : -<br>
Advantages :-<br>
a)	Appearance of powder does not become oily &amp; sticky.<br>
b)	It resembles milk powder with bright milky colour.<br>
c)	Oil does not separate out upon reconstitution with water.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a method for preparation of milk based powder beverage &amp; micronutrients with homogeneous appearance without fat separation after reconstitution with better availability of all the nutrients. In short beverage resembles homogenized milk.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a method for manufacturing of the said product by dry blending to improve the quality and standard of the product.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a method for manufacturing of the said product<br><br>
with oil lecithin mixture to improve the homogeneity and free flowing property, so that it can be dissolve easily during the process of beverage preparation.<br>
The other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.<br>
