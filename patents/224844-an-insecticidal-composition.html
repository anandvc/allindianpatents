				<td>Insecticidal agents and compositions have been developed to control insect pests such as agrohorticultural pests, hygienic pests, or wood-eating pests and in practice have been used as a single or a mixed agent. However, economically efficient and ecologically safe insect control compositions are still being sought.  Znsecticidal compositions which allow for reduced effective dosage rates, increased environmental safety and lower incidence of insect resistance are highly desirable. Although the rotational application of insect control agents having different modes of action may be adopted for good pest management practice, this approach does not necessarily give satisfactory insect control.  Further, even though combinations of insect control agents have been studied, a high synergistic action has not always been found. Obtaining an insecticidal composition which demonstrates no cross-resistance to existing insecticidal agents, no toxicity problems and little negative impact on the environment is extremely difficult.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a synergistic insecticidal composition which demonstrates a high controlling effect with concomittant reduced crop production cost and reduced environmental load.<br><br>
It is another object of this invention to provide methods for synergistic insect control and enhanced crop protection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a synergistic insecticidal composition comprising as essential active ingredients a synergistically effective amount of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist in combination with one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of pyrethroids, pyrethroid-type compounds, recombinant nucleopolyhedroviruses capable of expressing an insect toxin, organophosphates, carbamates, formamidines, macrocyclic lactones, amidinohydrazones, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) antagonists, and acetylcholine receptor ligands.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for synergistic insect control which comprises contacting said insect with a synergistically effective amount of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist in combination with one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of pyrethroids, pyrethroid-type compounds, recombinant nucleopolyhedroviruses capable of expressing an insect toxin, organophosphates, carbamates, formamidines, macrocyclic lactones, amidinohydrazones, GABA antagonists and acetylcholine receptor ligands.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the enhanced protection of plants from infestation and attack by insects.<br><br><br><br>
* Synergism • as used in this application means a cooperative action encountered in a combination of two or more biologically active components in which the combined activity of the two or more components exceeds the sum of the activity of each component alone.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a composition which comprises a combination of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist and a second inaecticidal ingredient provides superior insect control at lower levels of the combined active agents than may be achieved when the neuronal sodium channel antagonist or the second inaecticidal ingredient is applied alone.<br>
As previously stated, the term neuronal sodium channel antagonist designates a compound which is capable of preventing the ability of a neuron cell to transfer sodium ions across the cell membrane.  A neuron cell thus affected is unable to fire, resulting in paralysis, and ultimately mortality, in the target host.

Further, the compositions of the invention may be particularly useful for the prevention and control of wood-eating insects such as termites (Isoptera), carpenter ants (Hymenoptera), wood-destroying beetles (Coleoptera) or the like.<br>
These and other advantages of the invention may become more apparent from the examples set forth herein below.  These examples are provided merely as illustrations of the invention and are not intended to be construed as a limitation thereof.<br><br><br>
In this evaluation, Heliothis zea   (cotton bollworm), Heliothis vireacena   (tobacco budworm) and pyrethroid-resietant Heliothis virescens  larvae used are obtained from laboratory colonies.  Pyrethroid-resistant H. virescens are derived from the PEG-strain [Campannola<br>
&amp; Plapp, Proceedings of Beltwide Cotton Conference (1988)1.<br>
Cotton leaves are immersed in 1:1 v/v, acetone/water solutions of test compound, or solutions of a combination of test compounds for a period of about 3 seconds.  Following immersion, leaves are allowed to air-dry for 2-3 hours.  Plastic bioassay trays containing multiple open-faced wells (4.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm) are used as the test arenas.  Cut portions of a treated leaf, a moistened cotton dental wick and a single third-instar larva are placed into each well, covered with an adhesive vented clear plastic sheet and held under constant fluorescent light at about 27°C for a predetermined period of time.  Larval mortality/morbidity is evaluated at 5 days after treatment.  All treatments are replicated 4-5 fold in a randomized complete block design with 16-32 larvae per treatment.  Using conventional log-probit analysis, the LC50 of each treatment is determined.<br>
Using the above protocol, a neuronal sodium channel antagonist (Compound A) may be evaluated alone at dose rates of 0.1 ppm, 1.0 ppm and 10.0 ppm and in combination with 1.0 ppm of a second insecticidal<br><br>
compound.  Treatments which may be used are shown in Table I.<br><br><br><br><br>
In this evaluation, adult male German cockroaches (Blattella germanica)  are  used.  For each test, a 4.0 g<br>
portion of ground Purina Dog Chow (Hi-Pro Glo*) is treated with an acetone solution of test compound alone or in combination with a second test compound.  After treatment, the acetone is evaporated and the treated dog chow is placed in a 3/4 oz plastic cup which is placed in a harborage made of folded sheets of blotter paper placed in a plastic box (16" L x 11" W x 6" H) . The plastic box (test arena) is also fitted with a 1 oz narrow mouth bottle with 2 dental wicks inserted at the mouth. A control box is prepared in the same manner using ground dog chow which has been treated with reagent grade acetone.  Each treatment is replicated three times.  Into each test arena are placed 20 healthy adult male cockroaches which have been reared in an insectary.  The test arenas are then stored at 76*F and mortality is determined daily by visual examination.  The data obtained are shown in Table II.<br><br><br><br><br>
In this evaluation, Helicoverpa zea   (cotton<br>
bollworm) larvae are obtained from a laboratory colony. Test compounds are dissolved in 1:1 v/v ace tone/water. Plastic bioassay trays (C-D International, Pitman, NJ) are used as test arenas.  Each tray contains 32 open-faced wells, 4.0x4.0x2.5 cm.  A portion {5 ml) of a wheat germ-soybean flour-based artificial diet (Southland Products, Lake Village, AR) is poured into each well. After the diet hardened, 0.4 ml of test solution is pipetted onto the diet surface in each well. Test solutions are evenly spread over surfaces of diet by picking up the tray and gently tilting it from side to side.  Trays are then held in a vented area for about 2 h, until water is no longer pooled on diet surfaces.  A single 4-day-old H.   zea larva  is then placed on the surface of diet in each well.  After larval infestation, each well is covered with an adhesive, vented, clear plastic sheet.<br>
All test arenas are held under constant fluorescent light and a temperature of about 27°c for duration of the assay. Larval mortality is determined at 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after treatment. A larva was considered to be dead if it exhibited little to no movement, even after being shaken in the diet tray. A total of 32 insects were tested for each treatment.<br><br><br><br>
capable of expressing an insect toxin demonstrate synergistic insect control.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. An insecticidal composition comprising a neuronal sodium channel antagonist of formula I:<br><br><br><br>
6. The composition as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the ratio of the active<br><br>
ingredients is 1 weight part of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist of formula I as claimed in claim 1 to 0.01 to 100 weight parts of one or more compounds of group A as claimed in claim 1.<br><br></td>
