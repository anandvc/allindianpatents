				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a construction method of a steel pipe having a diameter of over 600mm, and in particular to a construction method of a steel pipe in which neighboring steel pipes are roughly arranged, and a shaper is installed at the ends of the steel pipes for thereby forming a perfect circle, and the ends of the perfect circles are arranged to abut with each other or are inserted into each other, so that abutting portions of inner or outer surfaces are welded.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, a steel pipe has been used for a line pipe, an oil pipeline, a water pipe, etc. and has a diameter of over 600mm. In the fabrication method of the steel pipe, there are a roll bending method and a spiral method. In the roll bending method, a steel pipe is bent with a circular cross section using a plurality of rolls, and the abutting ends of the steel pipes are welded in the direction of a centerline. In the spiral method, the steel pipe is wound in a spiral shape using a belt steel and is welded, while twisting the same.<br>
The spiral method in the fabrication method of the steel pipe has a thin plate material, and a mass production is made easier. However, in the case that the steel pipe is thick, accuracy is decreased during the fabrication. Therefore, the roll bending method has been generally used.<br>
Even when the steel pipes are fabricated based on the  roll  bending method,  it  is  very  difficult  to achieve a perfect circle steel pipe due to its fabrication method, so that a non-perfect circle steel pipe is fabricated. The allowable error has a range of 0. 5% of a circular surrounding length based on the KS standard. As the diameter of the steel pipe gets increased, the error gets increased. For example, in the case of the steel pipe of 600mm, the error is permitted within a range of 597mm-603mm, so that at least 6mm error occurs. The error is more increased at the upper portion of the steel pipe due to the accumulating error in addition to the above error, so that there are many problems in the abutting method and the constriction based on a socket connection.<br>
The above problems occur due to the following reasons. Namely, when the steel pipes are constructed using a socket joint type at the construction site of the steel pipes, it is needed to insert the other end of the neighboring steel pipe into the socket of one end of the steel pipe, so that it is impossible to achieve a proper insertion because of the deformed cross section shape of the steel pipe.<br>
In the conventional insertion method of the steel pipe, a certain wedge is inserted into the portion that is not inserted due to the deformed shape to have a certain perfect circle in a state that the other end of the neighboring steel pipe is suspended at the socket of an end of the steel pipe and is stroke. In another method, a turnbuckle or a chain block is inserted at an inner surface of the steel pipe for thereby performing an insertion process.<br>
Since the above steel pipe is inserted under the ground, the ground is excavated along the line in which the steel pipe is buried. The insertion construction of<br>
the steel pipe is performed in a state that the steel pipes are roughly arranged at the excavated portions. Therefore, in this case, the work gets bad, and the construction period may be delayed, and safety accidents may occur.<br>
In particular, it is needed to excavate the ground deeper and wider at the portions of abutting both ends of the neighboring steel pipes. Since the workers have to work the insertion construction of the steel pipe at the above portions, the construction period is delayed and extended, and safety accidents may occur.<br>

device 33  is  installed at the guide rail  32  for thereby<br>
performing a welding operation, moving by the driving source<br>
of a trolley 34. In the welding robot 30b, the semicircular<br>
i body 11 of the shaper 10 of one side includes a guide rail 32.<br>
The welding device 33 performs a welding work, moving along<br>
the guide rail 32. In the above descriptions, the operation<br>
that the welding device 33 moves along the guide rail 32 was<br>
described. In another embodiment of the present invention, a<br><br>
carriage having a small driving error with a self-driven unit may be preferably adapted.<br>
In addition, in the above description of the present invention, the welding robot 30b is installed at the shaper 10 of the outer surface of the steel pipe P, but a certain welding robot may be installed at an end of the outer surface of the steel pipe P.<br>
The construction method of the steel pipe according to the present invention will be described based on the above-described construction of the equipment.<br>
1) Arranging process<br>
An excavating work is performed along a line in which steep pipes P are buried using an excavator or a back hoe (BH) that is heavy equipment. A clamp is engaged at a crane that is adapted to perform an excavating work and at an end of a work arm R of the excavator or back hoe, respectively. The steel pipe P is caught by the clamp and is placed down. As shown in Figure 6A, the steel pipes are arranged. When arranging the steel pipes P, the ends of the steel pipes P are arranged to meet each other in consideration of easier installation work of a shaper that is followed.<br>
At this time, in the excavating work, since the lengths of the steel pipes P are 6m 9m and 12m fabricated based on the roll bending method or spiral method, the excavated portions corresponding to the ends of the steel pipes P are formed deeper and wider based on the lengths of the steel pipes P because a shaper 10 is installed at the end portions of the steel pipes, and a welding device is installed for the conjunction portions of the outer surface of the steel pipe P.<br><br>
2) Perfect circle formation process<br>
As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the shaper 10 is installed at the ends of the steel pipes P that are arranged in the aligning process, and the steel pipes P are pressurized in the radial direction from the inner and outer sides of the steel pipes P using the shaper 10 for thereby achieving a perfect circle shape and maintaining the same. In the process of installing the shaper 10 at the ends of the steel pipes P, the shaper 10 is engaged at the end of the work arm R of the back hoe, and then in a state that a locking device 15 of the shaper 10 is unlocked, the opening and closing cylinder 14 is operated, so that the semicircular bodies 11 and 12 are widened about the axis 13. At this time, the work arm R of the back hoe is moved and positioned at the semicircular bodies 11 and 12 of the shaper 10 for thereby holding the ends of the steel pipes P.<br>
In this state, two semicircular bodies 11 and 12 are contracted to form one circle by operating the opening and closing cylinders 14 and are locked using the locking device 15, and a plurality of pressurizing cylinders 16 installed at the semicircular bodies 11 and 12 in a radial shape are operated. All or part of the pressurizing cylinders 16 can be selectively operated. When selectively operating the pressurizing cylinders 16, the protruded portion is pressurized by operating only the pressurizing cylinder 16 positioned at the portion more outwardly protruded rather than an imaginary perfect circle for thereby achieving a perfect circle.<br><br>
The ends of the neighboring steel pipes P are deformed to have a certain perfect circle using the shaper 10 and are fixed.<br>
In the above descriptions, the operation that the pressurizing is performed in the direction from-the outer side of the steel pipe P to the center when shaping the ends of the steep pipes P to have a certain perfect circle, but the pressurizing may be performed in the radial direction from the inner side of the steel pipes P to the outer side. In addition, the pressurizing is performed in the direction of the center of the steel pipes P at the outer and inner sides of the steel pipes P, and concurrently the pressurizing is performed in the direction from the center of the steel pipes P to the outer side.<br>
3) Matching process<br>
After the steel pipes are deformed to form a perfect circle in the perfect circle formation process, the steel pipes P are preferably matched in the horizontal state. As shown in Figure 9, the steel pipes P are pulled using the pulling unit so that the ends of the neighboring steel pipes P are inserted into the ends of the steel pipes P.<br>
The above operation will be described in detail. The pulling unit 20 installed at the shaper 10 of the ends of the steel pipes P is operated so that one side steel pipe P among the neighboring steel pipes P is pulled. At this time, the ends of the neighboring steel pipes P are relatively pulled and inserted into the socket PS of the steel pipe P.<br><br>
In the above operation, the ends of the steel pipes P are deformed to have a certain perfect circle by the shaper 10 for thereby achieving a smooth and easier insertion.<br>
4) Welding process<br>
After the ends of the neighboring steel pipes P are inserted and engaged in the above matching step, as shown in Figures 10 and 11, the conjunction portions of the inner or outer surface of the steel pipes P are welded and rust-prevented and sealed.<br>
In the process of welding the conjunction portions of the inner surface of the steel pipes P, as shown in Figure 10, the welding robot 30a installed in the interior of the steel pipes P is positioned near the conjunction portions of the inner surface of the steel pipes P and is fixed, and the arm 3 7 of the welding robot 30a is adjusted in the horizontal and vertical states. The welding unit 31 is set to rotate along the conjunction portions of the inner surface of the steel pipes P, and the welding unit 31 is rotated using the rotary shaft 36 for thereby welding the conjunction portions of the inner surface of the steel pipes P.<br>
After the welding process  is  completed  in the  above<br>
manner, the set state of the welding robot 3 0a is released,<br>
and  the  welding  robot  3 0a  is  moved  in  the  longitudinal<br>
(centerline) direction of the steel pipes P and is fixed at a<br>
certain portion.<br>
In the process of welding the conjunction portions of the outer surface of the steel pipes P, the welding robot 30b installed at the semicircular body 11 of the shaper 10 installed at the outer surface of the steel pipe P, namely,<br><br>
the welding device 33 installed at the trolley 34 of the guide rail 32 is moved along the guide rail 32 in the direction from the lower side to the upper side of the conjunction portions of the outer surface of the steel pipes P, welding the conjunction portions of the outer surface of the steel pipes P.<br>
When welding the conjunction portions of the outer surface of the steel pipes P, if there is a certain concern about the limitation of the welding work due to the shaper 10, the shape 10 is disassembled and moved in the direction of the steel pipes P inserted into the socket PS of the steel pipes P or the end portion of the other steel pipe P, and then the welding ia performed using the welding device 33 of the welding robot 30b. As indicated by the arrow of Figure 11, the welding operation performed in the direction from the lower side to the upper side of the steel pipe P is performed more than two times for thereby finishing the welding work.<br>
In the above descriptions of the present invention, the method of inserting using the steel pipes P having the socket PS at ore end of the same was described. In another embodiment of the present invention, the abut joint method in which the outer ends of the neighboring steel pipes P are abutted and welded may be performed.<br>
Industrial Applicability A described above,  in the construction method of the<br>
steel pipes according to the present invention, the excavating<br>
work  is  performed  at  the  construction  site,  and  the<br>
neighboring steel pipes are roughly arranged, and the ends of<br>
the neighboring steel pipes are held and pressurized in the<br><br>
radial shape in the inner and outer directions for thereby forming and fixing a perfect circle state. Thereafter, the ends of the neighboring steel pipes are horizontally arranged, and the ends of the steel pipes maintain abutted and inserted for thereby welding the conjunction portions of the inner surface or outer surface of the steel pipes, so that it is possible to achieve an easier construction of the steel pipes and to minimize the construction period of the steel pipes.<br>
In the present invention, a plurality of hydraulic are provided at the semicircular body of the shaper in a radial shape, and a welding robot capable of welding the conjunction portions of the inner surface of the steel pipes P is provided, so that it is possible to, prevent a safety accident that may occur during a perfect circle shaping work of the ends of the steel pipes or the welding work.<br>
