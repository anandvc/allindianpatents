Process for the preparation of haloaenated hYdroxvdiphenvl compounds<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of halogenated hydroxydlphenyl compounds of the formula<br><br>
and to the use of these compounds as disinfectants for protecting organic materials from<br>
microorganisms.<br><br>
WO 99/10310 disclpses a four-stage process for the preparation of 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether (triclosan) by acylation of a halobenzene compound (first stage), etherification of the acylated compound using a halogenated phenol compound in an Ullmann-analogous reaction (second stage), Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the etherified compound (third stage) and subsequent hydrolysis.<br>
However, the yields in this process are moderate, in particular yields of 
Surprisingly, it has been found that significantly higher yields can be achieved for the second reaction stage [f halogenated phenol compounds which are not further substituted in the ortho position are used as starting compounds for the Ullmann condensation.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a four-stage process for the preparation of halogenated hydroxydlphenyl compounds, which are not further substituted in the 2'- and 6'-position, of the formula (1), in which in the first stage a halogenated benzene compound is acylated, in the second stage the acylated compound is etherified using a halogenated phenol compound which is not further substituted in the ortho-position, in a third stage the etherified compound is oxidized and in the fourth stage the oxidized compound is<br><br>
hydrolysed, wherein the reaction of the second stage is carried out in the presence of K2CO3 and any desired copper catalyst, where K2CO3 is used in a concentration of from 0.5 to 3 mol, based on the phenol compound employed of the formula (6), according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
In the first reaction step (acylation reaction), compounds of the formula (5) are prepared. Usually, this reaction is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid, e.g. aluminium halide, in particular aluminium chloride. The Lewis acid is in this case employed in a 1 to 3, preferably 1.25 to 2, molar amount, based on the halogenated compound of the formula (5). A possible acylating reagent for this reaction is an acyl halide, in particular acetyl chloride.<br>
C1-C4alkyl is preferably a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical, e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
The Lewis acid and acylating reagent are preferably employed in equimolar amounts. The reaction is carried out in the solvents customary for Friedel-Crafts reactions, e.g. nitrobenzene, dichlorobenzene, methylene chloride or ethylene chloride. The reaction time<br><br>
for this reaction stage plays a minor part and can vary within wide bounds, from, for example, 1 to 18 hours.<br>
In the second reaction stage, the compounds of the foRmula (7) are prepared. The etherification of the free OH group of the halogenated phenol compound of the formula (6) is carried out in alkaline medium using K2CO3, and in the presence of any copper catalyst, for example metallic copper, copper(l) and copper(ll) oxides, copper halides and copper acetates or CuCOa x Cu(0H)2 and an inert organic solvent, e.g. toluene or a xylene isomer mixture. The reaction can also be carried out, however, in the presence of polar solvents, for example DMF or DMSO.<br>
The reaction times for this reaction step are usually 1 to 24 hours, preferably 2 to 10 hours; the temperature ranges from 80 to 250'C, preferably 100 to lyoC.<br><br>
The base (K2CO3) is used in concentrations of preferably from 0.8 to 2 mol per mole and very particularly 0.9 to 1.1 mol per mole, based on the phenol compound employed.<br>
The phenol compound of the formula (6) is preferably employed in a definite excess.<br>
In the third reaction stage (oxidation), compounds of the fonnula (8) are prepared.<br>
The oxidation of the acyl compound of the formula (7) to the compound of the formula (8) (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation) can be carried out using various oxidizing agents. Suitable oxidizing agents are, for.example:<br>
a mixture of dilute peracetic acid and acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalytic<br>
amount of perchloric acid;<br>
m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) in water;<br>
diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDDA);<br>
a mixture of dilute peracetic acid and acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid;<br>
perbenzoic acid (PBA)<br>
a mixture of sodium borate and trifluoroacetic acid;<br>
a mixture of formic acid, hydrogen peroxide, acetic anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide<br>
and acetic acid;<br>
a mixture of acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, acetic anhydride and phosphorus<br>
pentoxide;<br>
a mixture of hydrogen peroxide/sulfuric acid/acetic acid;<br><br><br><br>
a mixture of KzSzOs, sulfuric acid and a 1:1 water/methanol mixture;<br>
a mixture of acetic acid and the potassium salt of monoperoxymaleic acid;<br>
a mixture of trichloromethylene, the potassium salt of monoperoxymaleic acid and<br>
sodium hydrogen sulfate;<br>
a mixture of maleic anhydride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen peroxide and<br>
trichloromethane;<br>
a mixture of maleic anhydride, a urea-hydrogen peroxide complex and acetic acid;<br>
magnesium monoperphthalate;<br>
a mixture of acetic anhydride, sulfuric acid and H202;<br>
a mixture of dichloroacetic acid and HaOg.<br>
Percarboxylic acids, m-Chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) or peracetic acid or a mixture of hydrogen peroxide/sulfuric acid/acetic acid is preferably used for the oxidation.<br>
If desired, a commercially available wetting agent can additionally be added to the oxidizing agent. The reaction times lie in a wide range and range from about 0.5 to about 15 hours, preferably 1 to 8 hours. The reaction temperature ranges from -20 to about 100°C, preferably from 0 to about 85°C.<br>
The subsequent hydrolysis to give the desired halohydroxydiphenyl ether of the fonnula (1) proceeds quantitatively in the acidic or alkaline medium.<br>
The process according to the invention preferably relates to the preparation of halohydroxydiphenyl compounds of the formula (1), in which<br><br><br>
for the control of microorganisms, in particular of bacteria, and as disinfectants for protecting organic materials and articles from attack by microorganisms is very versatile. Thus they can be applied to these in diluted or undiluted form, for example, together with wetting or dispersing agents, e.g. as soap or syndet solutions for the disinfection and cleaning of human skin and hands, of hard articles and in dental hygiene compositions.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without restricting it thereto.<br><br>
Preparation examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of 2.5-dichloroacetophenone (first reaction stage)<br><br>
147 g (1.0 mol) of p-dichlorobenzene are completely melted at GCC in an apparatus having an attached dropping funnel, stirrer and reflux condenser. 120 g (0.9 mol) of anhydrous AlCU are added to the melt. 39.3 g (0.5 mol) of acetyl chloride are then added dropwise to the readily stirrable suspension at 60°C in the course of about 1 hour, a clear solution slowly resulting. After heating to 110'C, the mixture is stirred at this temperature for 7 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the brown reaction mass is hydrolysed by cautious decantation onto a mixture of 200 ml of water and 200 g of ice. The temperature of the mixture is kept between 30 and 40'C during the hydrolysis by external cooling. After separation of the phases, the lower, organic phase is washed with 400 ml of water and, after fresh phase separation, subjected to fractional distillation. The aqueous phases are discarded.<br>
Yield: 66 g of 2,5-dichloroacetophenone (70% of theory, based on acetyl chloride)<br><br>
Example 2: Preparation of 1-(5-chloro-2-(2.4-dichlorophenoxv)phenvlethanone (second reaction stage)<br><br>
164.4 g of K2CO3 (1.03 mol), 0.86 g of copper(ll) oxide and 600 g of xylene isomer mixture are initially introduced and 132.5 g of 4-chlorophenol and 189.1 g of 2,5-dlchloro-acetophenone are introduced with stirring. The grey suspension is heated to reflux at 144°C and 8 g of water are distilled off in a water separator. After a residence time of 2.5 h at 145°C, the reaction mass is cooled to 80°C, 500 g of water are added and the mixture is stirred for 15 min. Phase separation is then awaited in a separating funnel. The lower aqueous phase is separated off (670 g). The conversion in the remaining organic phase (desalted reaction mass; 921 g) is determined by means of HPLC. Yield: 257.0 g of the compound of the formula (102) (91.3% of theory).<br>
Example 3: Preparation of 1-(5-chloro-2-(2.4-dichlorophenoxv)phenvnethanone (2nd reaction stage) using basic copper carbonate as the catalyst<br>
The procedure is as described in Example 2, with the difference that instead of copper(ll)<br>
oxide, basic copper carbonate (CuCOa x Cu(0H)2) is employed.<br>
The yield is 260.7 g of the compound of the formula (102); (92.6% of theory).<br><br>
Example 4: Preparation of 5-chloro-2-(4-chloroDhenoxv)Dhenol (third and fourth reaction stage)<br><br>
14 g of the acetyl compound of the fonmula (102) are suspended in 100 ml of deionized water at 20'C using a wetting agent. 29 g of 70% 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) are scattered in and the mixture is heated with stirring. A resin/water phase is formed from 52°C; the mixture is heated to about 80'C and kept at this temperature for 7 hours.<br>
It is treated with 0.5 g of sodium hydrogen sulfite to destroy excess peroxide. Two clear phases are obtained by addition of 50 ml of xylene isomer mixture and 9 g of ION NaOH. The water phase having a pH of about 12 is separated off; the solvent phase comprising the compound of the formula (103) is washed with water until neutral.<br>
To hydrolyse the ester, the xylene phase is treated with 24 g of 10% NaOH and stirred under reflux (about 95°C) for 5 hours. The xylene phase is then separated off and the pale brown water phase is adjusted to a pH of about 3 using 4 g of 34% hydrochloric acid at 25°C. In the course of this, the product precipitates in sandy, beige-coloured form and, after filtration, can be thoroughly washed with water on the suction filter. After drying, 5 g of the crude product of the formula (104) having a melting point of 73 to 74°C are obtained.<br><br>
After recrystallization from petroleum ether 80/110, the pure substance is obtained in colourless crystals having a melting point of 74 to 74.5°C.<br>
Example 5: Preparation of 5-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenoxv)phenol (third and fourth reaction stage)<br>
a)	Preparation of the Baever-Villiger reaction (=BV reagent)<br>
300 g of anhydrous acetic acid are initially introduced,<br>
102 g of 96% sulfuric acid are metered in (internal temperature 
106.2 g of 50% hydrogen peroxide solution are metered in, the internal temperature being<br>
maintained at 
The mixture is then stirred for a further hour at 20*'C.<br>
b)	Preparation of the Baever-Villiger initial mixture (=BV initial mixture)<br>
450 g of anhydrous acetic acid are initially introduced with cooling,<br>
440 g of 96% sulfuric acid are metered in (internal temperature 
281.1 g of crystalline 2-acetyl-4,4'-dichlorophenyl ether are introduced at an internal<br>
temperature of 20°C.<br>
c)	Baever-Villiger reaction<br>
BV reagent is metered into the BV initial mixture in the course of 4 hours (internal tempeature 30°C).<br>
The reaction is then kept at an internal temperature of 40°C for 2 hours and at an intemal temperature of 50'C for 0.5 hours.<br>
d)	Work-up<br>
The work-up is carried out according to the customary methods.<br>
623 g of 2-OH-4,4'-DCDPE are obtained as a 30% solution in 1,2-PG.<br>
This corresponds to 187 g of 100% strength of 2-OH-4,4'-DCDPE (73% of theory).<br><br><br>
