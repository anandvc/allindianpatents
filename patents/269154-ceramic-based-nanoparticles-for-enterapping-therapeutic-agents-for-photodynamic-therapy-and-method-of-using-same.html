FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of photodynamic therapy<br>
and more particularly to a novel drug-carrier system for photodynamic therapy.<br>
DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART<br>
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is an emerging modality for the treatment of a<br>
variety of oncological, cardiovascular, dermatological and ophthalmic diseases [1,2].<br>
PDT for cancer is based on the concept that light sensitive species or<br>
photosensitizers (PS) can be preferentially localized in tumor tissues upon systemic<br>
administration [2,3]. When such photosensitizers are irradiated with an appropriate<br>
wavelength of visible or near infra-red (N1R) light, the activated molecules pass on<br>
their energy to surrounding molecular oxygen. This results in the formation of<br>
reactive oxygen species (ROS), like singlet oxygen ('02) or free radicals. ROS are<br>
responsible for oxidizing various cellular membranes including plasma,<br>
mitochondria, lysosomal and nuclear membranes etc., resulting in irreversible<br>
damage of cells [2-6]. Under appropriate conditions, PDT offers the advantage of an<br>
effective and selective method of destroying diseased tissues without damaging<br>
adjacent healthy ones [3].<br>
However, most photosensitizing drugs (PS) are hydrophobic, i.e. poorly<br>
water soluble, and therefore, preparation of pharmaceutical formulations for<br>
parenteral administration is highly hampered [2-7]. In order to overcome this<br>
difficulty, different strategies have evolved to enable the stable dispersion of these<br>
drugs into aqueous systems, often, by means of a delivery vehicle. Upon systemic<br>
administration, sw.h drug 'doped carriers are preferentially taken up by tumor tissues<br>
by the virtue ol the 'Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect [2, 8-10].<br>
The earners include oil-dispersions (micelles), liposomes, polymeric micelles,<br>
hydrophilic drug-polymer complexes, etc. Oil-based formulations (micellar systems)<br>
using non-ionic poloxyethylated castor oils (e.g. Tween-80, Cremophor-EL, CRM,<br>
etc.) have shown enhanced drug loading and improved rumor uptake, presumably<br>
due to interaction with plasma lipoproteins in blood [11-13]. However, such<br>
emulsifying agents are also reported to elicit acute hypersensitivity (anaphylactic)<br>
reactions in vivo [14,15]. Liposomes are concentric phospholipid bilayers<br>
encapsulating aqueous compartments, which can contain hydrophilic and lipophilic<br>
drugs [2]. Although the tumor-uptake of liposomal formulation of drugs is better<br>
than that of simple aqueous dispersions, they suffer from poor drug loading and<br>
increased self-aggregation of the drug in the entrapped state [2, 16-18]. Liposomes<br>
are also prone to opsonization and subsequent capture by the major defense system<br>
of the body (Reticulo-Endothelial System, or RES) [18]. Recently, drugs<br>
incorporated inside pH sensitive polymeric micelles have shown improved tumor<br>
phototoxicity compared to CRM formulations in vitro, however in-vivo studies<br>
showed poor tumor regression and increased accumulation in normal tissues<br>
[7,19,20].<br>
Hydrated ceramic based nanoparticles, doped with photosensitive drugs,<br>
carry the promise of solving the problems associated with free as well as polymerencapsulated<br>
drugs. Such ceramic particles have a number of advantages over<br>
organic polymeric particles. First of all, the preparative processes involved, which<br>
are quite similar to the well known sol-gel process, require simple and room<br>
temperature conditions [21,22]. These particles can be prepared with desired size,<br>
shape and porosity, and are extremely stable [22], Their ultra low size (less than 50<br>
nm) can help them evade capture by the RES. hi addition, there are no swelling or<br>
porosity changes with change in pH, and these particles are not vulnerable to<br>
microbial attack [23]. These particles also effectively protect doped molecules<br>
(enzymes, drugs etc.) against denaturation induced by extreme pH and temperature<br>
[24]. Such particles, like silica, alumina, titania etc. are also known for their<br>
compatibility in biological systems [24,25,26]. In addition, their surfaces can be<br>
easily iunclioiiali/ed with different groups [26,27], and therefore they can be<br>
attached to a variety of monoclonal antibodies and other ligands in order to target<br>
them to desired sites in vivo.<br>
Although synthesis of ceramic nanoparticles, mostly but not exclusively<br>
based on silica, has been extensively reported in literature [28-30], their application<br>
in drug delivery has not yet been fully exploited. Thus, there is an ongoing need to<br>
develop novel drug delivery systems for PDT therapy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides compositions and methods useful for photodynamic<br>
therapy. The compositions of the present invention comprise ceramic based<br>
nanoparticles in which one or more therapeutic agents are entrapped.<br>
This invention also provides a method for the synthesis of the ceramic based<br>
nanoparticles in which one or more therapeutic agents are entrapped. When<br>
synthesized by the method of the present invention, the particles were found to be<br>
spherical and highly monodispersed.<br>
In one embodiment, this invention provides a method for the synthesis of<br>
photosensitizer dye/drug doped silica-based nanoparticles (diameter ~30 nm), by<br>
controlled alkaline hydrolysis of a ceramic material (such as triethoxyvinylsilane<br>
(VTES)) in micellar media.<br>
In one embodiment, the photosensitive drug/dye used was 2-devinyl-2-(lhexyloxyethyl)<br>
pyropheophorbide (HPPH), an effective photosensitizer which is in<br>
Phase I/II clinical trials at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA [32,33].<br>
Although the particle matrix does not interfere with the visible absorption spectra of<br>
the entrapped photosensitizing drug, the quenching of fluorescence of the drug was<br>
found to be largely prevented in aqueous media. Singlet oxygen detection<br>
experiments revealed that the entrapped photosensitizer is able to interact with the<br>
surrounding molecular oxygen and the singlet oxygen generated is able to permeate<br>
out of the silica matrix. Such doped particles are actively taken up by tumor cells<br>
and light irradiation of suitable wavelength resulted in irreversible destruction of<br>
such impregnated cells. Accordingly, the ceramic-based particles of the present<br>
invention can be used as carriers for photodynamic therapy drugs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides ceramic nanoparticles in which one or more<br>
therapeutic agents are entrapped. The present invention also provides a method for<br>
the synthesis and use of the ceramic particles loaded with one or more therapeutic<br>
agents The term "nanoparticles" is used herein to indicate particles that are lOOnm<br>
of less in diameter.<br>
The ceramic nanoparticles of the present invention can be used to deliver<br>
therapeutic agents such as photosensitive drugs or dyes to cells for photodynamic<br>
therapy. The drugs may be hydrophobic and hydrophilic.<br>
In one embodiment, the silica particles useful in the present invention are<br>
organically modified silicate (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles loaded with a hydrophobic<br>
photosensitive (also referred to herein as photosensitizer) drug. To prepare the<br>
nanoparticles, the photosensitizer is entrapped inside the non-polar core of sodium<br>
bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT)/l-butanol/water micelles which are dissolved<br>
in alkoxy-organosilane (such as triethoxyvinylsilane (VTES)) and precipitated by<br>
alkaline hydrolysis (such as by ammonia, ammonium compounds or amine<br>
containing compounds) under gentle conditions (such as stirring at room<br>
temperature for 24 hours). The precipitated materials and surfactant are removed by<br>
dialysis. The dialysis can be carried out for prolonged period of time (such as 50<br>
hours) indicating that the entrapped agent has stable dispersion over a long tune.<br>
The main advantage of ORMOSIL nanoparticles over other nanoparticles<br>
is that the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups on the precursor<br>
alkoxy-organosilane helps them to self-assemble both as normal micelles and<br>
reverse micelles under appropriate conditions. The resulting micellar (and reverse<br>
micellar) cores can be used for entrapping biomolecules like drugs, proteins, etc.<br>
Such a system has a number of advantages including: (a) they can be loaded with<br>
both hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic dyes, (b) they can be precipitated in oil-inwater<br>
microemulsions so that corrosive solvents like cyclohexane and complex<br>
purification steps like solvent evaporation, ultra-centrifugation etc., can be avoided<br>
(c) their organic group can be further modified for the attachment of targeting<br>
molecules, and (d) they may be can be possibly bio-degraded through the<br>
biochemical decomposition of the Si-C bond. The presence of the organic group<br>
also reduces the overall rigidity and density of the particle, which is expected to<br>
enhance the stability of such particles in aqueous systems against precipitation.<br>
Spherical, monodisperse particles of colloidal silica can be conveniently<br>
prepared by hydrolysis of tetraalkyl silane. This method, commonly referred to as<br>
i:he 'sol gel method, can be further extended in the synthesis of organically<br>
modified silica (ORMOSIL) particles, where the precursor alkoxysilane molecules<br>
also include one or two organic groups. The incorporation of organic groups modify<br>
the final structure of the silica network, e.g. leading to the formation of mesoporous<br>
matrices, characterized by a network structure of ordered and uniform porosity.<br>
Such porous matrices can host a number of optically as well as biologically active<br>
molecules like fluorescent dyes, proteins, anticancer drugs, image contrast agents,<br>
etc.<br>
For using the ceramic particles of the present invention, the drug loaded<br>
particles can be administered locally or systemically. Local administration can be<br>
effected, for example, by injection of a composition comprising the drug/dye loaded<br>
ceramic particles proximate to the target tissues or intratumoral. In local treatment<br>
of superficial tumors, the nanoparticles can be topically administered by<br>
incorporating into standard topical compositions involving lotions, suspension, or<br>
pastes. Systemic administration can be implemented by intravenous, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intraperitoneal or rectal route. Formulations for these modes of<br>
administration are well known in the art; exemplary formulations are described, for<br>
example, in Remmington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Easton, Pa.:Mack Publishing<br>
Co.<br>
The nanoparticles entrapping a drug/dye can be administered in the form, of a<br>
composition made up in a suitable form appropriate for the desired use; e.g., oral,<br>
parenteral, or topical administration. Suitable dosage forms for oral use include<br>
suspensions, dispersion, emulsions in the form of tablets, dispersible powders,<br>
granules, capsules, syrups, and elixirs. Inert diluents and carriers for tablets include,<br>
for example, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, and talc. Tablets may<br>
also contain granulating and disintegrating agents such as starch and alginic acid,<br>
binding agents such as starch, gelatin, and acacia, and lubricating agents such as<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be<br>
coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption. Inert diluents<br>
and carriers which may be used in capsules include, for example, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate, and kaolin. Suspensions, syrups, and elixirs may contain<br>
conventional excipients, for example, methyl cellulose, tragacanth, sodium alginate;<br>
wetting agents, such as lecithin and polyoxyethylene stearate; and preservatives,<br>
e.g., ethyl-p-hydroxybenzoate. Dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration<br>
include ceramic nanoparticles in suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, and the like.<br>
hi general, ceramic nanoparticles are highly stable, and may not release any<br>
encapsulated biomolecules even at extreme conditions of pH and temperature [24].<br>
Conventional drug delivery methods require the carrier vehicle to .free the<br>
encapsulated drug in order to elicit the appropriate biologic response [3]. However,<br>
this is not required when macromolecular carrier molecules are used for the delivery<br>
of photosensitizing drugs in PDT [3,31]. hi the present invention, we have<br>
developed ceramic-based nanoparticles as carriers of photosensitizing drugs for<br>
applications in PDT. Their porous matrix of the nanoparticles is permeable to<br>
molecular oxygen as well as reactive oxygen species (singlet oxygen and free<br>
radicals) and the nanoparticles do not release any significant amounts of entrapped<br>
drugs into an aqueous environment. Therefore, the desired photodestructive effect<br>
of the drug can be maintained even in the entrapped form.<br>
By the method of the present invention, silica based nanoparticles, doped<br>
with a water-insoluble photosensitizing anticancer drugs such as HPPH, can be<br>
synthesized in micellar media. The doped particles, with a unimodal size distribution<br>
of 30 run, can be formulated as stable aqueous dispersion. Although the drug is<br>
embedded inside the particle matrix, it can be sensitized by irradiation with light of<br>
appropriate wavelength, and the generated singlet oxygen can diffuse out of the<br>
particle matrix. Such doped nanoparticles are actively taken up by tumor cells and<br>
light irradiation of such impregnated cells results in significant cell-death. These<br>
observations demonstrate that various ceramic based matrices can be used as drug<br>
carriers for Photodynamic Therapy. The particles of the present invention can be<br>
used as injectable formulations for safe and efficient trafficking to tumor tissues in<br>
vivo.<br>
hi one embodiment, the specific tumor-targeting ligands can be attached to<br>
the surface of the ceramic nanoparticles. Recently, our group has synthesized silica<br>
based nanoparticles which encapsulate a magnetic core [39]. These particles were<br>
functionalized with a peptide hormone targeting agent (lutinizing hormone releasing<br>
hormone (LH-RH)). The resulting 'nanoclinic' was shown to selectively target LHR<br>
l l receptor positive tumor cells Exposure to a DC magnetic field then resulted in<br>
the selective magnetocyto lysis of the receptor positive cells only (U.S. patent no.<br>
6,514,481, incorporated herein by reference). Thus, the ceramic surface of the<br>
nanoparticles of the present invention can be functionalized with different ligands in<br>
order to target the particles to tumor-cells containing such ligand-specific receptors.<br>
The present invention is further described by way of examples presented<br>
below which are intended to be illustrative and not restrictive in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example describes the preparation of the drug-loaded silica<br>
nanoparticles. To illustrate this embodiment, silica particles loaded with HPPH were<br>
synthesized. Surfactant Aerosol OT (AOT, 98%), Co-surfactant n-Butanol (99.8<br>
%), and Triethoxyvinylsilane (VTES, 97%), were purchased from Aldrich. MTT and<br>
isopropanol are a product of Sigma. Deuterium oxide (99.9 Atom % D) was<br>
obtained from Isotec Inc., USA. Dye/Drug HPPH 2-devinyl-2-(l-hexyloxyethyl)<br>
pyropheophorbide[38] was a kind gift from Dr. Tom Dougherty, Roswell Park<br>
Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York. Dye anthracenedipropionic acid-disodium salt<br>
(ADPA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, USA. Cell-Culture products like<br>
medium MEM-alpha, 5 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), Phosphate Buffered Saline<br>
(PBS) etc. were purchased from GIBCO, USA. All the above chemicals were used<br>
without any further purification.<br>
The nanoparticles, both void and drug-loaded, were synthesized in the nonpolar<br>
core of AOT/n-Butanol/Water micelles, as shown schematically in Figure 2.<br>
The micelles were prepared by dissolving 0.44 g of AOT and 800 fiL (0.56 g) of nbutanol<br>
in 20 mL of double distilled water by vigorous magnetic stirring. To the<br>
resulting clear solution, 40 ]U.L of HPPH in DMF (15 mM) and 10 /iL of pure DMF<br>
were dissolved by magnetic stirring (in case of void ormosil particles, 50 fiL of<br>
DMF and no HPPH was added). Then to the micellar system, 200 /iL of neat<br>
triethoxyvinylsilane (VTES) was mixed and allowed to stir for about one hour, or till<br>
the solution becomes clear. After that, 10 jttL of aqueous ammonia (10 M) solution<br>
was added and the system was allowed to stir for about twenty hours. The entire<br>
reaction was earned out at room temperature. At the end of the process, a bluishwhite<br>
translucency indicating the formation of nanoparticles was observed. After the<br>
formation of drug-doped nanoparticles, surfactant AOT and co-surfactant n-Butanol<br>
were completely removed by dialyzing the solution against water in a 12-14 kD cutoff<br>
cellulose membrane (from Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., USA) for 40 hours. The<br>
dialyzed solution was then filtered through a 0.2 Micron cut-off membrane filter<br>
(Nalgene, USA), and was used for further experimentation.<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was employed to determine the<br>
morphology and size of the resulting aqueous dispersion of nanoparticles, using a<br>
JEOL JEM 2020 Electron Microscope, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200<br>
kV. The results are shown in Figure 1 as a Transmission Electron Microscopy<br>
(TEM) picture of the drug loaded nanoparticles. The particles are spherical, having<br>
unimodal size distribution, with an average size of 30 nanometers (as prepared with<br>
the above protocol).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example demonstrates that the emission characteristics of the entrapped<br>
drug is the same as the unentrapped drug. To illustrate this embodiment, UVVisible<br>
absorption Spectra of the silica particles in which the drug was entrapped<br>
and free drug was recorded on a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) UV-3101 PC<br>
Spectrophotometer, using 1 cm thick Quartz Cuvettes and fluorescence Spectra was<br>
recorded on a Shimadzu RF 5000U Spectrofluorimeter using 1 cm thick Quartz<br>
cuvette. The UV-Visible absorption spectra of HPPH, in AOT/BuOH/Water<br>
micelles as well as entrapped inside nanoparticles show the same peak positions for<br>
the two (Figure 3). This demonstrates that there is no shift in peak position of<br>
HPPH upon entrapment inside nanoparticles. A control experiment, using void<br>
nanoparticles, shows virtually no absorption in the visible and Near Infra-Red (NIR)<br>
wavelength region (600-900 ran), which is the region of interest (Therapeutic<br>
Region) in PDT due to the high tissue penetration of light. Therefore, such particles<br>
can be effectively used in PDT, as they do not interfere with the therapeutic light<br>
used for excitation of photosensitive anticancer drugs.<br>
Figure 4 represents the fluorescence emission spectra of HPPH, in<br>
AOT/BuOH/ Water micelles as well as entrapped inside nanoparticles, The spectra<br>
for both the samples, at an excitation wavelength of 414 nm, were recorded before<br>
and after dialysis against distilled water (which effectively removes the surfactant<br>
and co-surfactant molecules used). While the emission for HPPH, in micelles as well<br>
as nanoparticles, are almost similar before dialysis, substantial difference between<br>
the two can be observed after dialysis. While the emission intensity from the<br>
nanoparticle doped HPPH is still significant (almost 75 % of the intensity obtained<br>
before dialysis), practically no emission is observed from the HPPH/ 'micelles' after<br>
dialysis. This can be explained by the fact that HPPH, being a non-polar molecule,<br>
aggregates in polar solvents and therefore its fluorescence gets self-quenched. As<br>
long as HPPH molecules are inside the non-polar core of micelles, they remain<br>
separated, but with the removal of surfactants, the molecules come increasingly in<br>
contact with the aqueous surrounding, and begin to aggregate. But in case of<br>
nanoparticle-doped HPPH, the drug molecules can be visualized as discretely<br>
embedded in the particle matrix (refer to Figure 1), and therefore, exposure to<br>
aqueous system does not result in their aggregation and significant loss of emission<br>
intensity. This property of entrapped drugs/dyes of resistance to self-quenching in<br>
aqueous media can be exploited to fabricate nanoprobes for imaging in biological<br>
systems.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example demonstrates the generation of singlet oxygen by the entrapped<br>
drug as detected by phosphorescence spectra. Detection of singlet oxygen ('Oa) has<br>
been extensively reported by its phosphorescence emission spectra at 1270 nm [34,<br>
35]. Since the lifetime of 'Oa in water is very low (2-5 fis) and hence its detection<br>
by the above method is very difficult, we have used Deuterium Oxide (D2O) owing<br>
to the enhanced lifetime (50-60 /is) of 'Oa in this solvent [36]. In a typical<br>
experiment, 3 niL of 22.5 jiiMHPPH, entrapped in nanoparticles dispersed in DaO,<br>
was used. HPPH solubilized in AOT/BuOH/DaO micelles and void nanoparticles in<br>
D2O were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. A SPEX 270M<br>
Spectrometer (Jobin Yvon) equipped with In-Ga-As photodetector (Electro-Optical<br>
Systems Inc., USA) was used for recording singlet oxygen phosphorescence<br>
emission spectra. A solid-state diode-pumped laser (Verdi, Coherent) was used as a<br>
- )source o( excitation ('5.32 nm). A 1 cm thick square quartz cuvette with sample<br>
solutions was placed directly in front of the entrance slit of the spectrometer and<br>
emission signal was collected from the side of cuvette at 90-degrees relative to<br>
exciting laser beam. As additional NIR long wave edge filter (Andover Corp., USA)<br>
was also placed before the photodetector.<br>
The results demonstrate that since ceramic matrices are generally porous,<br>
photosensitizing drugs entrapped within them can interact with molecular oxygen by<br>
diffusion of oxygen through these pores. Any reactive oxygen species (ROS),<br>
formed as a result of interaction of oxygen with the excited photosensitizer, will<br>
diffuse out of the porous matrix, into the surrounding environment, where it can be<br>
detected. We have studied the generation of singlet oxygen, the ROS which evolves<br>
from HPPH, by its phosphorescence emission spectra at 1270 nm. Figure 5 shows<br>
the spectra for HPPH, sombilized in micelles as well as entrapped in nanoparticles.<br>
Both the spectra show peaks at 1270 nm, indicating the evolution of singlet oxygen<br>
in both the cases. Control spectrum, ran with void nanoparticles, shows no<br>
phosphorescence peak. This demonstrates that singlet oxygen is indeed generated by<br>
photosensitized HPPH in the entrapped state, which can diffuse out through the<br>
pores of the ceramic matrix to interact with the surrounding environment.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example demonstrates the generation of singlet oxygen by the entrapped<br>
drug as detected by a chemical method using disodium salt of anthracenedipropionic<br>
acid (ADPA) as detector. In addition to Phosphorescence Spectra, generation of<br>
singlet oxygen was also detected chemically, using disodium salt of ADPA (9,10-<br>
anthracenedipropionic acid) as singlet oxygen sensor [36]. Disodium-ADPA (a<br>
water-soluble anthracene-derivative) is bleached to its corresponding endoperoxide<br>
on reaction with singlet oxygen, which was followed spectrophotometrically by<br>
recording the decrease in Optical Density at 400 nm (AniaK of ADPA). In a typical<br>
experiment, 150 jttL of disodium-ADPA in D2O (5.5 mM) was mixed with 3 mL of<br>
15 /iM HPPH (in AOT/DjO micelles as well as entrapped in nanoparticles in D2O)<br>
in 1 cm thick Quartz Cuvettes. A control experiment was carried out with disodium-<br>
ADPA mixed with void nanoparticles dispersed in DaO. The resulting solutions<br>
12. -<br>
were irradiated with a 650 nrri Laser Source (Solid-State Diode-Pumped Laser) and<br>
their Optical Densities were recorded every 10 minutes in a spectrophotometer.<br>
Figure 6 shows the time-dependent bleaching of ADPA, observed by the<br>
decrease in Optical Density (OD) at 400 nm (absorption maxima for ADPA), upon<br>
incubation with different samples and photo-exposure. The plots with HPPH,<br>
solubilized in micelles as well as doped in nanoparticles, show sharp fall in OD with<br>
time of light exposure, indicating ample evolution of singlet oxygen in both the<br>
cases. Plot with void nanoparticles incubated with ADPA showed no reduction in<br>
OD with time, indicating that the bleaching of ADPA is a result of generated singlet<br>
oxygen and not by the irradiated light.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Tliis example demonstrates that the silica nanoparticles, in which a<br>
photosensitizer drug/dye is entrapped can be taken up by cells. For studying<br>
nanoparticle uptake, KB cell line (human epithelial oral carcinoma cells) was used.<br>
Cells were maintained at 37°C (humidified 5% COa atmosphere) in DMEM medium<br>
with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Monolayers of cells, in 3 ml of medium, were<br>
incubated with 100 fil of aqueous dispersion of HPPH (15 jiM) doped nanoparticles<br>
for an hour in 60x15 mm tissue-culture plates. The cells were rinsed with sterile<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and directly observed under a confocal laser<br>
scanning microscope.<br>
Having established the generation of cytotoxic singlet oxygen molecules by<br>
HPPH doped inside nanoparticles, we determined the uptake of such doped<br>
nanoparticles by tumor cells using fluorescence imaging technique. The two-photon<br>
fluorescence image of tumor (KB) cells (Figure 7 A) shows significant staining in the<br>
cytoplasm and membranes, indicating accumulation of nanoparticles in those<br>
regions. Localized spectra of the cytoplasm, shown in Figure 7B show the<br>
characteristic emission peak for HPPH (665 nm)., which effectively separates HPPH<br>
fluorescence from auto-fluorescence of such cells. The viability of such treated cells<br>
was verified by their morphology and it indicated the cells were alive even after 10<br>
hours of staining.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
This example demonstrates that the silica nanoparticles of the present<br>
invention can he used for photodynamic therapy. As an illustration, cell viability<br>
was studies in cells which had taken up the drug loaded silica nanoparticles with and<br>
without photoirradiation. For studying cell viability, UCI-107 (University of<br>
California, Irvine, CA) tumor cell line was used. Cells were maintained in MEM<br>
alpha Medium with 5% FBS at 37°C (humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere). Prior to the<br>
experiment, 24-well plates were inoculated with cells (7.5 X 105 cells/well) and<br>
incubated overnight. The medium was removed and the wells were rinsed three<br>
times using sterile PBS. After careful rinsing, 2 mis of fresh medium was replaced<br>
into each well. Pre-determined concentrations of the drug, as determined by Optical<br>
Density measurements, i.e. (a) 20 f*M HPPH in 120 pL 0.25% Tween-80/Water<br>
micelles, (b) 20 fiM HPPH encapsulated in 120 juL aqueous nanoparticle dispersion,<br>
(c) 120 /iL 0.25% Tween-80/Water micelles, and (d) 120 /iL aqueous voidnanoparticle<br>
dispersion, were added to designated wells at this time, and the plate<br>
was then returned to the incubator for two hours. The wells were rinsed three times<br>
with sterile PBS, and fresh medium was replaced at a volume of 2 mis/well.<br>
Immediately following medium replacement, the wells was exposed to a 650 nm<br>
light source (using solid-state diode-pumped laser) for 10 minutes each. After the<br>
completion of exposure to the light source, the plate was returned to the incubator<br>
overnight. Cell viability was estimated by means of the colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay [37]. MTT measures<br>
only viable living cells and absorbance at 570 nm is found to be directly<br>
proportional to the number of such cells. Briefly, MTT was dissolved in sterile PBS<br>
at a concentration of 5mg/ml and added to each well at a volume of 200 jtd/well. The<br>
plate was then incubated at 37°C with 5% COa for 4 hours. After incubation,<br>
medium containing MTT solution was carefully aspirated from all wells. 2 mis of a<br>
0.1 N HC1 in anhydrous isopropanol solution were added to each well to dissolve<br>
any purple MTT formazan crystals that formed. The resulting purple solution's<br>
absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Bausch &amp; Lomb Spectronic 601<br>
spectrophotometer. Average absorbance of control cells, which were incubated with<br>
only serum supplemented medium, represents 100% cell survival. Four fold<br>
replicates were run per drug arid light dose, and each experiment was repeated three<br>
times.<br>
The results in Figure 8 show percentage of cell survival on treatment of<br>
UC1-107 tumor cells with various agents (relative to pure medium as control) and<br>
subsequent photo-activation. Significant cell-death can be observed for both HPPH<br>
in Tween-80 micelles (about 7 % cell-survival) and HPPH doped in nanoparticles<br>
(about 11 % cell-survival). In addition, substantial cellular toxicity can be observed<br>
for blank Tween-80 micelles, which is usually known to be a non-toxic surfactant,<br>
while blank nanoparticles have very little toxicity. In general, it can be concluded<br>
that HPPH doped nanoparticles are almost as effective a drug/carrier system as<br>
HPPH solubilized in Tween-80 micelles for killing tumor cells.<br>
EXAMPLE?<br>
This example describes the use of nanoparticles of the present invention can<br>
be used in an animal. Female SCID mice carrying a human tumor can be injected<br>
intraperitoneally with HPPH doped nanoparitcles (1014 particles per gram body<br>
weight). After injection, the animals can be housed for 24 h in single cages in<br>
absolute darkness. The mice can be anaesthesized with 5.5 p.g fentanyl and 5.5 mg<br>
metomidat-hydrochloride (Janssen Cilag, Sulzbach, Germany) in 0.9% NaCl per 100<br>
g body weight and the fur shaved once more before photoirradiation. The tumors can<br>
be exposed for 2 min to laser light of 532 nm with a power of 50 mW to deliver a<br>
total irradiation dose of 30 J/cm2 (ambient temperature 25°C). The light can be<br>
delivered using a fiber optic light delivery system. Tumors of animals without<br>
photoirradiation can serve as controls. Assessment of tumor response can be<br>
determined by changes in size and histological morphology. Based on the<br>
description provided herein, the nanoparticles can be used for PDT in other<br>
individuals including humans.<br>
Although the present invention is demonstrated through the examples<br>
presented herein, routine modifications of the various embodiments will be apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of the invention as<br>
described in the specification and claims.<br>
