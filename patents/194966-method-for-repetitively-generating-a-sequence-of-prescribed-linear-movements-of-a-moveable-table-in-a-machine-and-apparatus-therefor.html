The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for repetitively generating a sequence of prescribed linear movements of a moveable table in a production or factory machine.<br>
Many systems are known to repetitively generate prescribed linear movements of a table in a machine. For example, a motorised lead-screw together with the appropriate controls can be employed to this effect. Similarly, hydraulically/pneumatically driven mechanical linkages can also be used.<br>
However the acceleration and speed of such devices may be limited in adjustability and functionality Furthermorer  the main driving element is often intermittently operated, and in both forward and reverse modes, thereby increasing power requirements and long term wear.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention has therefore as an object to provide an improved method and apparatus for repetitively generating a prescribed sequence of linear movements of a moveable table in a machine, the drive unit for the apparatus operating at nearly constant speed and the inertial load limited mainly to that of accelerating the moveable table and its contents. According to this invention an apparatus for repetitively generating a<br><br>
(2) sequence of prescribed linear movements of a table in a machine, the table<br>
being constrained to be able to move in substantially a horizontal line, comprises an endless flexible loop unslippably mounted upon and caused to move around two rotatable end wheels separately located from the moveable table, the plane, of the moving loop being closely parallel to the line of travel of the table, and two or more releasable gripping mechanisms are attached to the moveable table, each mechanism adapted to grip, hold and release part of the moving loop, there being provided preferably at least one releasable gripping mechanism for each of the two strands of the moving loop between the rotatable end wheels. The method for repetitively generating a sequence of prescribed linear movements of a moveable table in a machine comprises, according to the invention, employing the above apparatus, using one of the two or more releasable gripping mechanisms provided to grip, hold and then release anv Dart of the moving loop between the two rotatable end wheels, so that the table is caused to make a single movement along its constrained path,(in one direction if part of the loop moving in that direction is held by one releasable gripping mechanism, or in the reverse direction if part of the loop moving in the opposite direction is held preferably by another releasable gripping mechanismleach releasable gripping mechanism being actuated repeatedly or one after the other to generate a prescribed sequence of table movements which eventually returns the table to its original starting position, from which the sequence of table movements is repeated by repeating the pattern of actuation of the releasable gripping.mecbanisms.<br>
Further improvements in features and methods of employing the apparatus are also disclosed.<br>
Not only is the resulting apparatus more economical than other known devices for achieving the same result, but also the accuracy and repeatability with which the apparatus can position the table are found in practice to be as good as, if not better than, such alternat	ive devices.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided :<br>
An apparatus for repetitively generating a sequence of<br>
prescribed linear movements of a moveable table in a machine,<br>
wherein the table being constrained to be able to move in<br>
substantially a horizontal line, characterised in that an endless<br>
flexible loop is unslippably mounted upon and caused to move<br>
around two rotatable end wheels separately located from the<br>
moveable table, the plane of the moving loop being closely<br>
parallel to the line of travel of the table, and two or more<br>
releasable gripping mechanisms are attached to the moveable<br>
table, each mechanism adapted to grip,hold and then release part<br>
of the moving loop, there being provided preferably at least one<br>
releasable gripping mechanism for each of the two strands of the<br>
moving loop between the rotatable end wheels.	<br>
A method for repetitively generating a sequence of prescribed linear movements of a moveable table in a machine, characterised in that a moving endless flexible loop, at any part of the moving loop between two rotatable end wheels separately located from the moveable table, upon which wheels the loop is unslippably mounted and caused to move around at a predetermined speed, is gripped, held and then released by one of two or more releasable gripping mechanisms attached to a table constrained to be able to move in a substantially horizontal line closely parallel to the plane of the flexible loop, so that the table is caused to make a single movement along its constrained path, in one direction if part of the loop moving in that direction is held by one releasable gripping mechanism or in the reverse direction if part of the loop moving in the opposite direction is held preferably by another releasable gripping mechanism, each releasable gripping mechanism being actuated repeatedly or one after the other to generate a prescribed sequence of table movements which eventually returns the table to its original starting position from which the sequence of table movements is repeated by repeating the pattern of actuation of the releasable gripping mechanisms.<br>
-  2A  -<br><br>
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:<br>
Two specific embodiments of an apparatus in accordance with the<br>
invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of one embodiment;<br>
Figure 2 is an end view of the apparatus in figure 1, part sectioned<br>
through the moving loop (3) and the feed shafts (1,2) and omitting<br>
mounting details for the feed shafts (1,2) and sprocket (5);<br>
Figure 3 is a side view of another embodiment; and<br>
Figure 4 is an end view of the apparatus in figure 3, part sectioned<br>
through the moving loops (47,48), the sprockets (41,42,43,44) and the<br>
feed shafts (1,2) and omitting mounting details for the feed shafts (1,2)<br>
and sprockets (41,42,43,44);<br>
In figure 1, a roller chain (3) is moved around sprockets (4,5) mounted on the machine separately from the moveable table (31) which slides in a nearly horizontal line along two feed shafts (1.2). One of the two sprockets (4 or 5) is provided with controllable driving means (not shown) to drive the chain (3). Two releasable gripping mechanisms (13, 14) are attached to the table (31), one each for each of the two strands of the chain between the sprockets. Each mechanism {13 or 14) is provided with two substantially planar pads (6,7 or 15,16) which have two opposing gripping surfaces facing each other across the chain (3) passing between the gripping surfaces. The innermost pad (6 or 15) in each mechanism {13 or 14) is fixed at or near its four corners to four parallel rods (two each shown in figure 1:- 9,10 and 1 8,19; and two each shown in figure 2:-9,11 and 1 8,20; the remaining one not shown in the figures). The other pad (7 or 16) is adapted to slide along the four rods at its four corners. The four rods also guide the passage of the chain (3) to remain within a channel defined by the plane of two rods on one side of the chain, the plane of the other two rods  on the other side of the chain and the two<br><br>
(4) gripping surfaces of the pads (6,7 or 15,16). The four rods are fixed at<br>
the other end to the body of a pneumatic actuator (8 or 17) attached to the moveable table (31). The actuating shaft of the pneumatic cylinder (8 or 1 7) is attached to the pad nearer it (7 or 16). The signal wires, sensors, timers and the tubes carrying air to the pneumatic cylinders are not shown in the figures.<br>
The lower mechanism (13) is shown in the "release" condition with the pads (6,7) apart to allow free passage of the moving chain (3). The upper mechanism(14) is shown in the "hold" condition with one pad (16) moved closer to the other pad (15) by the pneumatic actuator (17) to grip the chain (3) unslippably and cause the table (31) to move, in figure 1 from right to left since this is the direction of movement of that part of the chain (3) held by the mechanism (14). The speed of the table is controlled by setting the controllable driving means to drive one of the sprockets (4 or 5) at the required angular rate.<br>
After the mechanism (14) is actuated to release the chain, (3), the moveable table may come to a halt because of frictional or other resistance forces, but also may, either before or after halting, be moved a further step in either direction by actuating one or the other mechanisms (13 or 14).<br>
In one example only of a prescribed sequence of movements, the table (31) may be moved , from a starting position, a given distance in either direction by actuating one of the two mechanisms (13 or 14), at a given speed set by the speed of the chain (3), and then returned to the original position by actuating the other mechanism (14 or 13) to move the tabje (31) back the same distance at the same speed as before. This example of a prescribed sequence of table movements can then be repeated by repeating the sequence of actuations of the gripping mechanisms (13 ,14).<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show an implementation of the invention with two roller<br><br>
( 5) chains (47, 48) mounted on sprockets (41, 42, 43, 44), each of the two<br>
roller chains moving at a different speed from the other. The operation of the releasable gripping mechanisms (13, 14) as specified above now results in a two speed movement of the table (31), one speed in the forward direction when one roller chain is gripped and another speed in the reverse direction when the other roller chain is gripped. In this way, for example, the table can be returned to its original starting position at a higher speed than its forward speed giving faster cycle times for the apparatus<br><br><br>
