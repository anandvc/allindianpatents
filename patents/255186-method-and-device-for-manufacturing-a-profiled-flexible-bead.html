METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MANUFACTURING A PROFILED FLEXIBLE<br>
BEAD<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  method  for<br>
5  manufacturing a profiled flexible bead in a polymer<br>
material on a glazing by encapsulation, the said method<br>
comprising a step of moulding, having brought at least<br>
one  moulding  element  into  contact  with  the  said<br>
glazing, by means of at least one sealing system, and<br>
10  to a device for implementing this method and to the<br>
glazing obtained by implementing this method.<br>
It relates more particularly to the production of the<br>
vents which allow the air present  in  the moulding<br>
15 elements during the encapsulation moulding of a<br>
flexible bead made of polymer material to be<br>
discharged, thus enabling a uniform distribution of the<br>
moulded polymer in the moulding element. The term<br>
"encapsulation" within the meaning of this invention is<br>
20 to be understood as meaning the use of a technique of<br>
injecting material into a closed-mould system, it being<br>
understood that the flexible bead may be formed over<br>
all or part of the periphery of the glazing or on any<br>
part of the glazing.<br>
25<br>
Indeed, in the absence of at least one vent, the<br>
encapsulation-moulded polymer runs the risk of<br>
exhibiting a profile that does not precisely correspond<br>
to the inverse of the cavity of the moulding elements<br>
30  or runs the risk of exhibiting roughnesses or bubbles.<br>
It is thus known in the prior art to produce controlled<br>
air leaks, particularly at the parting line of the<br>
moulding elements, but these air leaks are often<br>
35 accompanied by leakage of material. This excess<br>
material has subsequently to be removed during a flash-<br>
removal operation which leads to a significant loss of<br>
time and requires a great deal of manpower because it<br>
is  an  operation  that  can  be  automated  only  with<br><br>
difficulty. It is not conceivable to let this material<br>
because the parting line of the moulding elements is<br>
always in vincinity of the lateral edge of the glazing<br>
and thus this material would be visible when mounting<br>
5  the glazing in the opening it has to close.<br>
It is, also, known to produce a sprue-vent channel by<br>
causing the air and the surplus material to discharge<br>
into  a  special  volume  of  the  mould,  even  in  the<br>
10 moulding cavity as in document JP 05084778, but this<br>
sprue has then to be removed from the mould before the<br>
next flexible bead can be moulded. This operation also<br>
generates a loss of time and also requires manpower<br>
because it is an operation that can be; automated only<br>
15  with difficulty.<br>
It is also known practice in the prior art to position<br>
on the glazing a strip of material that adheres to the<br>
glazing and to make a vent at this strip so that the<br>
20 excess material becomes deposited on this strip and is<br>
subsequently easier to remove. However, this solution<br>
also leads to a loss of time in sticking down the<br>
adhesive strip and removing it and also requires<br>
manpower  because  it  is  an  operation  that  can  be<br>
25  automated only with difficulty.<br>
The object of the invention is to alleviate the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art by proposing a method<br>
that makes it possible to produce at least one vent<br>
30 without causing a loss of time or, at the least, while<br>
reducing the losses of time, both in the moulding and<br>
in the subsequent finishing. By virtue of the method<br>
according to the invention, the encapsulation operation<br>
can be automated more readily and the producing of the<br>
35 vents in itself generates neither a loss of time nor an<br>
additional manual flash-removal operation.<br>
The present invention thus relates in its broadest<br>
sense to a method for manufacturing a profiled flexible<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
bead in a polymer material on a glazing by<br>
encapsulation, the said method comprising a step of<br>
moulding, having brought at least one moulding element<br>
into contact with the said glazing , by means of at<br>
5 least one sealing system, characterized in that at<br>
least one vent is formed inside the said sealing<br>
system.<br>
This vent could be at an extremity in direct contact<br>
10 with atmosphere exterior to the mold cavity in which<br>
the profile bead is formed or could constitute a simple<br>
closed cavity for the welcome of the air during the<br>
molding, the air being thus compressed in this cavity<br>
by the progression of the material in the moulding<br>
15 cavity; however according to the invention the vent is<br>
realized in the interior of the sealing system , in<br>
contac with the glazing; il is thus not realized in the<br>
interioir of the cavity molding.<br>
20 This vent (or these vents) is (are) preferably formed<br>
between a plurality of lips of the sealing system at<br>
least one of this lip being interrupted and/or having<br>
at least one hole and/or being more supple than at<br>
least one other.<br>
25<br>
When a vent is produced between several lips, at least<br>
two lips are preferably more or less parallel or<br>
coaxial.<br>
30 Prior to moulding the flexible bead, each zone of the<br>
glazing in which a vent is produced is preferably<br>
prepared so that any excess material that forms in the<br>
region of a vent adheres to the glazing. This adhesion<br>
is preferably identical to the adhesion of the flexible<br>
35  bead to the glazing.<br>
This preparation can be done either by applying an<br>
adhesion primer, or by applying an adhesive strip.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
One particular feature of the method according to the<br>
invention is that the production parameters for the<br>
said flexible bead are constant throughout a production<br>
run, that is to say that injection is performed at<br>
5 constant volume or constant weight and at the same<br>
pressure from one flexible bead to the next. It is<br>
therefore no longer necessary, as it was before during<br>
a production run (same glazing , same flexible bead) to<br>
adjust the quantity or pressure of the material to be<br>
10 injected, particularly when dimensional discrepancies<br>
show up on the glazings. These discrepancies now have<br>
no impact on the flexible bead itself. They simply<br>
cause a greater or lesser amount of flash at the vent<br>
or at each vent.<br>
15<br>
This excess material that forms in the region of a vent<br>
or in the region of each vent is not removed after the<br>
manufacturing of the profile bead, before delivery to<br>
the client or before monting in the opening it has to<br>
20  close.<br>
When the method according to the invention is<br>
implemented for producing a flexible bead on a glazing<br>
intended to be mounted on any vehicle and in particular<br>
25  automobile vehicle, the said glazing at least partially<br>
having a decorative strip of  the attached strip of<br>
coloured  material   (enamel)   or  strip  of  coloured<br>
material incorporated into the substrate type, the vent<br>
(or vents) is (are) at least partially, and preferably<br>
30 wholly, produced behind the said decorative layer when<br>
the vehicle is viewed from the outside looking in.<br>
Thus, the surplus material escaping through this<br>
(these) verit(s) will be concealed from the outside, at<br>
least  partially  and  preferably  wholly,   by  the<br>
35 decorative strip. This material will further be in<br>
general concealed from the interior of the vehicle by<br>
ornamental edges.<br>
On this premise also,  prior to the moulding of the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
flexible  bead,  at  least  one  reinforcing  or  fixing<br>
insert; may be positioned in a moulding element so that<br>
the flexible bead formed subsequently incorporates this<br>
insert at least.<br>
5<br>
The present invention also relates to a device for<br>
manufacturing a profiled flexible bead made of a<br>
polymer material on a glazing by encapsulation, the<br>
said device comprising at least one moulding element<br>
10 brought into contact with the said glazing by means of<br>
at least one sealing system, characterized in that the<br>
said sealing system comprises means for producing at<br>
least one vent within the said sealing system.<br>
15 In the device according to the invention, the said<br>
sealing system preferably comprises at least one<br>
annular seal or a plurality of seal portions forming an<br>
annulus, the said system thus exhibiting an axis A.<br>
20  The  said  means  for  producing  at  least  one  vent<br>
preferably consist of a plurality of lips at least one<br>
of which is interrupted and/or has at least one hole<br>
and/or is more supple than at least one other.<br>
25 This lip that is interrupted and/or has at least one<br>
hole and/or is more supple than at least one other is<br>
preferably situated closest to the said flexible bead<br>
with respect to the other lip(s).<br>
30  When the said means for producing at least one vent<br>
consist of a plurality of lips, at least two lips are<br>
preferably more or less parallel, or coaxial when they<br>
are annular.<br>
3 5 The said sealing system preferably comprises at least<br>
one groove, which is annular when the sealing system is<br>
annular, this groove having, in cross section, the<br>
shape of a V or U for example, the opening of which<br>
faces towards the glazing. It is in this groove that<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
the vent is produced, that is to say that it is in this<br>
groove that the air expelled by the material injected<br>
into the moulding cavity will be compressed and that<br>
the excess material will spread out and adhere to the<br>
5  glazing.<br>
When the glazing at least partially has a decorative<br>
strip, the said means for producing at least one vent<br>
are preferably positioned at least partially behind the<br>
10 said decorative strip at the time of injection, so that<br>
the excess material can be produced at least partially,<br>
and preferably wholly, behind the decorative strip when<br>
the vehicle is viewed from the outside looking in.<br>
15 The said means for producing at least one vent are<br>
preferably positioned at a location opposed with<br>
respect to at least one (or each) injection nozzle via<br>
which the material that forms the flexible bead is<br>
injected into the said moulding element at least. The<br>
20 expression "opposed with respect to" here is to be<br>
understood as meaning:<br>
when the nozzle is positioned at one longitudinal<br>
end of a longitudinal moulding cavity, "opposed with<br>
respect to" denotes the other longitudinal end;<br>
25 - when the nozzle is positioned in the middle of a<br>
longitudinal moulding cavity, "opposed with respect to"<br>
denotes one longitudinal end;<br>
when the moulding cavity is annular, "opposed with<br>
respect  to"  denotes  a  position  approximately  180°<br>
30  removed from the nozzle about the axis of the annulus.<br>
The present invention also relates to a glazing having<br>
at least one profiled flexible bead made of a polymer<br>
material obtained by encapsulation by implementing the<br>
3 5 method according to the invention or by using the<br>
device according to the invention.<br>
The flexible bead of the glazing thus produced thus<br>
comprises  when  delivering  to  the  client  and  by<br><br>
-7-<br>
consequence also when and after mounting in the opening<br>
it  has  to  close,  at  least  one  excess  of  material<br>
corresponding to the site where the said vent at least<br>
was produced.<br>
5<br>
In the case of a glazing for a vehicle, this excess<br>
material is preferably positioned on a side of the<br>
glazing intended to face, and effectively facing after<br>
mounting of the glazing in the opening, the inside of<br>
10  the motor vehicle.<br>
In the case of a glazing for a vehicle also, when the<br>
said glazing at least partially has a decorative strip<br>
of the attached strip of coloured material (enamel) or<br>
15 strip of coloured material incorporated into the<br>
substrate type, the said excess material is at least<br>
partially positioned behind the said decorative strip<br>
and preferably positioned wholly behind this strip,<br>
when the vehicle is viewed from the outside looking in.<br>
20<br>
In the case of a glazing for a vehicle also, the<br>
flexible bead may comprise at least one insert, or even<br>
several inserts, for fixing the glazing in place or<br>
reinforcing it or for the fixation of accessories.<br>
25<br>
In the case also of a glazing that only partially has a<br>
decorative layer, that is to say has a decorative layer<br>
not over the entire surface of the glazing equipped<br>
with a flexible bead, the said excess material may be<br>
30 at least partially positioned behind a facing when the<br>
vehicle is viewed from the inside looking out.<br>
A glazing within the meaning of the present invention<br>
is to be understood as meaning any glass or plastic<br>
35  panel that is monolithic or multiple,  that is to say<br>
formed of one or several sheets of material.<br>
According to the invention, a use of this glazing could<br>
be realized for closing an opening and in particular an<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
opening in a body of a vehicle and particularly of an<br>
automobile vehicle.<br>
This  use  is  realized without  prior  removing  of  the<br>
5  excess  material  that  forms  in  the  region  of  the<br>
vent (s) .<br>
Advantageously, the present invention thus makes it<br>
possible to produce one (or several) controlled venting<br>
10 zone(s) in one (or several) specifically chosen zone(s)<br>
of the glazing and which will not be visible or will be<br>
visible only slightly on the glazing once installed.<br>
Advantageously also, the vent(s) is (are) thus produced<br>
15  on a side of the glazing in an element guiding the<br>
excess material, actually inside a seal.<br>
The excess material generated for each vent can thus be<br>
concealed behind a decorative strip and therefore does<br>
20  not  affect  the  aesthetic  characteristics  of  the<br>
glazing.<br>
It may also be concealed behind a facing, particularly<br>
when no decorative strip is provided.<br>
25<br>
This excess material does not affect the mechanical<br>
properties of the flexible bead either, because it<br>
adheres to the glazing in the same way as the flexible<br>
bead.<br>
30<br>
Thus, the excess material may be left on the glazing<br>
and there is therefore no need to remove it before<br>
delivering to the client and before mounting in the<br>
opening it has to close.<br>
35<br>
Time is saved prior to moulding because there is no<br>
need to carry out a special operation for preparing the<br>
vent: all that is required is for the glazing zone near<br>
the vent is siutated to be prepared in the same way as<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
the zone of the glazing to which the flexible bead is<br>
to adhere.<br>
Time is also saved after moulding because there is no<br>
5  need to carry out any flash-removal.<br>
Advantageously too, the method according to the<br>
invention is compatible with all materials customarily<br>
used for performing encapsulation techniques.<br>
10<br>
The present invention will be better understood upon<br>
reading the detailed description hereinafter of some<br>
non-limiting exemplary embodiments and from studying<br>
the attached figures:<br>
15<br>
•	Figure  1  illustrates  a  simplified  view  from<br>
beneath  of  a  moulding  device  according  to  the<br>
invention,  on a horizontally-orientated glazing,  the<br>
view being taken at the underside of the glazing;<br>
20     •  Figure 2 illustrates a view in section on B-B' of<br>
Figure 1; and<br>
•	Figure 3 illustrates a view in section on C-C of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
25  In order to make the figures easier to understand,<br>
these figures are not drawn strictly to scale.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a glazing (2) on which a profiled<br>
flexible  bead  (1)  made  of  a  polymer  material  is<br>
3 0  produced.<br>
The polymer material of which the flexible bead (1) is<br>
made  may  be  a  thermoplastic  (PVC,  TPE,  etc.),  a<br>
polyurethane or alternatively a synthetic rubber of the<br>
35  EPDM type or any other suitable material.<br>
The method of manufacture of the flexible bead (1) is<br>
termed "encapsulation" because it involves a step of<br>
moulding the flexible bead  (1)  in a moulding device<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
(10) between two moulding elements, an upper moulding<br>
element (3) and a lower moulding element (3'), as can<br>
be seen in Figure 2.<br>
5 In the figures, the flexible bead (1) is arranged<br>
around the entire periphery of the glazing (2) but this<br>
flexible bead could perfectly well be positioned on<br>
only part of the periphery of the glazing or on any<br>
part of the glazing.<br>
10<br>
Each moulding element is closed around the glazing (2)<br>
by virtue of a sealing system (4); however, for greater<br>
clarity, only the sealing system (4) for the lower<br>
moulding element (3') has been depicted.<br>
15<br>
It is these sealing systems which make it possible to<br>
maintain sufficient pressure inside the mould while the<br>
polymer material is being injected.<br>
2 0 These sealing systems also make it possible, to a<br>
certain extent, to "compensate" for the manufacturing<br>
and tolerances on the glazing, that is to say to<br>
compensate for any discrepancies that may arise on the<br>
nominal dimensions of the glazing within the mould.<br>
25<br>
Each sealing system constitutes an annular seal,<br>
positioned at the periphery of the glazing and has an<br>
axis A, in this instance directed vertically because<br>
injection  is  performed  onto  a  glazing  positioned<br>
30 horizontally; however, the axis A could also be<br>
orientated horizontally if injection is performed onto<br>
a glazing positioned vertically, or orientated in any<br>
other way.<br>
35 According to the invention, in order to allow the air<br>
to escape from the moulding cavity of the moulding<br>
elements closed onto the glazing when the material that<br>
constitutes the flexible bead is being injected, at<br>
least one vent is formed inside the said sealing system<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
(4) .<br>
It  is  recalled here that,  the injection pressure  is<br>
often in the region of a few bars to a few tens of<br>
5  bars, particularly for PU-RIMs, but may also be as much<br>
as   a   few  hundred  bars,   particularly   for   PVC<br>
(poly(vinylchloride)) resins.<br>
Of course, this (or these) vent(s) also allows (allow)<br>
10  a small amount of excess material to escape from the<br>
moulding cavity for moulding the flexible bead without<br>
in any way  leaving  the  sealed enclosure  and more<br>
specifically  the  enclosure  defined  by  the  sealing<br>
system  (4)  in its entirety.  The excess material  (9)<br>
15  escaping in this way into the vent is illustrated in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
To do this, the sealing system (4) of the lower<br>
moulding element (3') comprises means for producing at<br>
20 least one vent within the said sealing system (4) . It<br>
is these means that will guide the excess material (9)<br>
to make it spread out where it is wanted, actually<br>
within the sealing system (4).<br>
25 These means may originate from an additional operation<br>
performed after the manufacture of the seal,<br>
particularly when the seal is extruded, or may<br>
originate from the very operation of manufacturing the<br>
seal,  particularly  when  the  seal  is  produced  by<br>
30  moulding.<br>
The sealing system  (4) may,  for example,  be made of<br>
silicone.<br>
3 5 In the version of the invention illustrated here, the<br>
means for producing at least one vent consist of a<br>
plurality of lips (5, 5') which are parallel, and more<br>
specifically coaxial, because the sealing system (4) is<br>
annular,  of which one,  the lip  (5)  situated axially<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
closest to the said flexible bead (1) , is interrupted:<br>
it exhibits a portion which is no longer in contact<br>
with the glazing, via which portion the air expelled by<br>
the injected material passes into the sealing system<br>
5 (4) and via which the excess material also passes into<br>
the sealing system (4).<br>
In an alternative form,  it might equally have been<br>
possible for this outer lip to be equipped with at<br>
10  least one hole or with a plurality of holes for the<br>
passage of the air and the excess material.<br>
In the version of the invention illustrated here, the<br>
lips  (5,  5')  have a more or less  triangular cross<br>
15 section and meet at their base. An annular V-shaped,<br>
groove (6) is thus formed between the two lips (5, 5').<br>
However, it is possible to conceive of other cross<br>
sections for the groove (6), particularly a U-shaped<br>
cross section. It is also possible that the bottom of<br>
20 the groove is in contact directly or indirectly (by the<br>
mean of a flapgate or a filter) with the atmosphere<br>
exterior to the mold.<br>
It is also possible to produce the groove (6) on only<br>
25  part  of  the  sealing  system  comprising  means  for<br>
producing at least one vent at the point (s) where the<br>
vent(s) is (are) to be produced. Thus, the cross<br>
section of the groove may have a maximum value at the<br>
interruption of  the lip axially closest to the said<br>
30  flexible bead (1)  and/or at the holes formed in this<br>
lip which is axially closest to the said flexible bead<br>
(1)  and  then  diminish  down  to  a  zero  value  with<br>
increasing distance away from this interruption and/or<br>
from these holes, after a few centimetres.<br>
3 5<br>
Furthermore, in the version of the invention<br>
illustrated here:, the lips (5, 5') constitute; upper<br>
vertical extensions of the sealing system (4) of the<br>
lower  moulding  element  (3'),  but  it  is  entirely<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
possible to make the two lips (5, 5') completely<br>
independent. In this latter variant in particular, it<br>
is preferable to produce the lip (5) situated axially<br>
closest to the said flexible bead (1) more supple than<br>
5 the other, so as to facilitate the passage of the air<br>
and of the excess material (9) into the groove (6)<br>
situated between the two lips and so as to prevent this<br>
air and this excess material from escaping from the<br>
sealing system (4).<br>
10<br>
A hole having a cylindrical cross section (7) may also<br>
be produced right along all or a part of the seal<br>
system (4) to facilitate the deformation of the latter<br>
while at the same time ensuring the desired level of:<br>
15  sealing.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, the vent is preferably<br>
positioned at a location opposed with respect to the<br>
injection nozzle (11) via which the material of which<br>
20 the flexible bead (1) is made is injected into the<br>
mould. More specifically, with the flexible bead being<br>
annular and more or less symmetric about its axis, the<br>
vent is positioned more or less at a location opposed<br>
to the region at which the material is injected, where<br>
25 the flux or fluxes arriving from each side meet. It may<br>
also be preferable to produce several vents even when<br>
just one injection nozzle is used, especially when the<br>
mould cavity extends over a long length.<br>
30 Prior to moulding the flexible bead (1), each region of<br>
the glazing (2) in which a vent is produced is prepared<br>
so that the excess material (9) adheres to the glazing<br>
(2) just like the flexible bead (1) adheres to the<br>
glazing (2).<br>
35<br>
The glazing (2) is preferably at least partially<br>
transparent and may be a monolithic glazing, that is to<br>
say one consisting of a single sheet of material, or<br>
may be a multiple glazing, that is to say one formed of<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
several sheets of material between which at least one<br>
layer of adhesive material is inserted in the case of<br>
laminated glazings, or at least one interlayer space is<br>
inserted in the case of double glazing. The sheets of<br>
5 material may be inorganic in nature, particularly made<br>
of glass, or organic, particularly made of plastic.<br>
In the case of a glazing for a vehicle, the glazing<br>
generally at least partially has, at its periphery, a<br>
10 decorative strip (8) . This decorative strip generally<br>
results from a deposit of enamel, produced on the<br>
inside of the glazing or on an interlayer face of the<br>
glazing in the case of composite glazing, but can also<br>
result from a partial and/or peripheral coloration of a<br>
15 sheet of material used, particularly a sheet made of an<br>
organic material. In this case, the vent (or vents) is<br>
(are) produced behind the said decorative strip (8) so<br>
that the excess material (9) is concealed by the<br>
decorative  strip  (8).  To  do  this,  the  means  for<br>
20 producing at least one vent are positioned at least<br>
partially under the said decorative strip (8) because<br>
the glazing is positioned horizontally and the flexible<br>
bead (1) is produced essentially under the glazing (2)<br>
in the version illustrated.<br>
25<br>
The excess material (9) is thus also produced on the<br>
side of the glazing intended to face the inside of the<br>
vehicle;.<br>
3 0 The vents could just as easily be produced at points<br>
other than under the decorative strip: in regions of<br>
the glazing which will be concealed once the glazing<br>
has been fitted.<br>
35 In the case of a glazing for a vehicle also, it is<br>
possible to position one (or several) insert(s) (12) in<br>
the moulding element (3, 3') prior to the moulding of<br>
the flexible bead (1) so that the flexible bead<br>
incorporates this (these) insert(s).<br><br>
-15 -<br>
This (or these) insert (s) may be one (or more)<br>
reinforcing insert(s) generally completely incorporated<br>
into the flexible bead (1) as can be seen in Figure 2,<br>
5 or may be one (or more) fixing insert(s), generally<br>
protruding, for securing the glazing or an accessory.<br>
The glazing (2) such as can be seen in Figures 2 and 3,<br>
having a profiled flexible bead (1) made of a polymer<br>
10 material and excess material (9) corresponding to the<br>
location where the vent has been produced, is then<br>
delivered in that state to the customer once it has<br>
been removed from the mould. No flash-removal operation<br>
is carried out when it leaves the mould before it is<br>
15 delivered to the customer and before it is mounted in<br>
the opening.<br>
The present invention is described in the foregoing by<br>
way of example. It is understood that the person<br>
20 skilled in the art is capable of producing various<br>
variants of the invention without thereby departing<br>
from the scope of the patent as defined by the claims.<br><br>
