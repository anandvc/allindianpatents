				<td>A METHOD FOR INCREASING THE PERMEABILITY OF WOOD<br>
The present invention relates to the treatment of wood, and is particularly concerned with a method for increasing the permeability of wood, especially moist wood<br>
The treatment of wood by impregnating it with preservatives and other agents, such as for fire-proofing, is very well known One of the problems of the impregnation treatment is ensuring that the agent has impregnated the wood fully or at least sufficiently<br>
It is also known to prepare wood tor impregnation by using steam 10 raise the temperature and pressure in the wood and break down some of the wood cells (after the pressure is rapidly reduced) and thereby to improve the natural permeability of the wood Updated steaming specifications for, for example, round wood radiata pine steam conditioning recommend the use of steam at a temperature of , and pressure of 138 kPa for a period of from 1.5 to 18 hours depending upon the thickness of the wood before the pressure is rapidly reduced While this treatment does help to improve the impregnation process, it has several disadvantages, particularly the duration of the treatment and the requirement for high pressure steam<br>
It is also known to dry wood and to form fibres by destroying the wood structure using microwave energ\. It is important in drying the wood using microwave energy not to damage the wood and special drying schedules have been proposed for different wood species In all of these schedules the microwave radiation intensity is very low below 5 to 10 W/cm2. in order to avoid damage to the wood.<br>
Destruction of wood using microwave energy to form fibres is performed at a considerably higher radiation intensity, tor example up to 150 k\V/cr.r. with the aim of heating the moisture in the wood to form steam very quickly and in sufficient quantity to enrirely break down the structure of the wood<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for increasing the permeability of wood which comprises subjecting wood with a moisture content (based on dry weight) of at least 15% to microwave radiation at a frequency (0 in the range of from about 0 1 to about 24 GHz with a power intensity (p) from about 10 W/cm2 to about 100 kW/cnr for a duration of from about 0.05 to about 600 seconds to cause water in the wood to vaporise resulting in an internal pressure in the wood such that the permeability of the wood is increased by partial or complete destruction of ray cell tissue, softening and displacement of wood resin, formation of pathways in the radial direction of the wood and/or by creating, on the base of destroyed rays, cavities in the wood, said cavities being primarily , in radial-longitudinal planes of the wood, and wherein the overall integrity of the wood is substantially maintained<br>
There is also provided wood whenever treated by the method described in the immediately preceding paragraph.<br>
Using the method of the invention, it is possible to selectively or randomly treat wood and produce wood having regions of differing permeability.   Therefore, according to another aspect of the invention there is provided wood having regions of differing permeability, wherein at least one of said regions has been treated to increase the permeability thereof ', relative to the untreated wood<br>
The microwave treatment of the present invention increases the permeability of the wood typically by vaporising water contained in the wood to create an internal pressure and a temperature above 100Â°C resulting in the modification of the wood structure by any one or more of the destruction of ray cells in the wood, softening and mobilising of the resin in the wood and replacing it at least partially with open pores, and the creation of thin radial checks resulting in cavities disposed mainly in radial-longitudinal planes There may he no substantial drying of the wood during the process of the invention The present invention may facilitate in-line processing of wood such as for impregnation or fast drying That us. The tain, radial checks and cavities formed by the method of the present invention may allow<br>
more effective impregnation of certain treatment agents The thin radial checks or cavities may also allow faster subsequent drying treatments than compared with the drying techniques conventionally employed in the absence of the treatment of the present invention For example, hard wood species (i.e. refractory woods), such as .eucalypts, may experience internal checking and collapse upon fast drying without the prior treatment of the present invention due to excessive pressure build up within the wood<br>
The microwave treatment of the present invention is not necessarily limited to subjecting the wood to a single microwave frequency or power intensity The method may comprise, for example, subjecting the wood to \ancus microwave frequencies and power intensities in .1 single treatment. Preferably, the power intensity. whether a single power intensity or a number of different power intensities are used, is maintained at not less than 10W/cm2 In a preferred embodiment, however, the power intensity is maintained above l0W/cm2<br>
The microwave treatment of the present invention may also be used to increase the permeability of a portion or portions of the wood either selectively or randomly For example, energy impulses of predetermined duration and separated by set time intervals or random impulses may be used to treat the wood Alternatively, microwaves may be directed at a portion or portions of wood to be treated    If a plurality of portions are to be treated.<br>
these may be selected randomly or in a predetermined manner with the proposed use of the final product in mind That is. depending on the required flexibility, strength, permeability and other required characteristics of the product Wood produced by either this selective or random treatment comprises regions of differing permeability wherein a treated portion of the wood constitutes at least one region and an untreated portion constitutes another region, and<br>
,  wherein the treated portion has greater permeability than the untreated portion<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably applied to the treatment of moist wood As used herein and throughout the specification the term "moist wood' refers broadly to wood which is "green" after sawing as would be understood by a person skilled in the an 1 he amount of water present in the moist wood will. 01 course, van' depending on the specie-<br>
of plant, but it is considered that moist wood will generally have a moisture content in the range of from about 30 to about 200% based on the dry weight of the wood. The process of the present invention is also applicable to the treatment of wood having lower moisture contents, such as from 15% to 30%.<br>
Wood is capable of absorbing very high quantities of microwave energy. The microwave energy causes the water in the cells of the wood to heat up and boil, creating steam pressure in the cells which results in the destruction of cell walls. The ray cells have thinner walls than the cells of the main wood tissues (tracherds. libriform) and ray cells are destroyed by the microwa\e energy before cells of the main wood tissue The destroyed ra\ cells form paths in the radial direction for the easy transportation of liquids and vapours inwardly from the outer surface. Ray cells form from about 5 to about 35% of the wood volume, so their destruction may increase the wood permeability substantially.<br>
The treatment, therefore, advantageously results in the destruction of ray cells while substantially maintaining the overall integrity of the wood. That is, the destruction of the ray cells may occur without significant destruction of cells of the main wood tissues (commonly referred to as the grams or fibres of the wood) resulting in treated wood which, as discussed hereafter, will generally have decreased tortional strength, but substantially unaffected flexural strength in the radial direction.   In a treatment of approximately four seconds duration, for example, a low frequency (f) of about 0 4 GHz is preferably used with a power intensity (p) of about 6 kW/cm2   A higher frequency of, for example 10 GHz is preferably used with a lower power intensity of about 0.24 kW/cm2   Most preferably, a frequency of from about 1 to about 2 4 GHz is used with a power intensity of from about 2 4 kW/cm2 to about 1 k\V/cm2<br>
As discussed above, increasing the intensity of microwave energy supplied to the wood increases the steam pressure therein to the extent of ray volume that the tracherd (libriform) walls begin to rupture The tensile strength of wood is two to three times less in the tangential direction than in the radial direction and with increased internal pressure, for<br>
example corresponding to increased intensity of microwave energy, the wood may be destroyed along the mam wood tissues. This results in checks which extend in the radial-longirudinal planes. Furthermore, as the tensile strength of the wood in the tangential direction reduces, as the temperature (and pressure) increases, the checks may be formed in die wood at comparatively low pressures. The treated wood will, therefore, generally have decreased torsional strength, but substantilly unaffected flexural strength in the radial direction<br>
When subjected to microwave energy. any resin in the wood sottens before melting and boiling Steam pressure in the wood forces the .soli resin to be displaced from rays, leaving pores or cavities in the wood This is a particularly effective means of increasing the permeability of wood having substantial quantities of resin <br>
For the softening of resin and its removal from, for example, radiata pine in a treatment of 1 about 12 seconds duration, a frequency of about 0 4 GHz and power intensity of about 2 kW/cm2 are preferably used If a higher frequency of about 10 GHz is used, the power intensity is preferably about 0.08 kW/cnr More preferably a frequency of from about 1 to about 6 GHz is used with a power intensity of from about 0.08 to about 0.13 kW/cm2<br>
The present invention substantially maintains the integrity or overall structure of the wood, but provides increased permeability which may enhance impregnation during subsequent treatments. The range of microwave frequencies suitable for the wood treatment is limited to from about 0.1 GHz to about 24 GHz. It is impossible at a frequency less than about 0 1 GHz to create sufficient energy in the wood to destroy the cell walls because, at the required power density. electric breakdown (punch-throu<h takes place and the wood is carboni7ed at a frequency greater than about ghz penetration depth of microwaves in most may be less to mm this generally will not permit .sufficiant distribution energy provide desired effects></h>
The desired power intensity will vary with the selected microwave frequency    At a freaquency<br>
of about 24 GHz, it is sufficient for the microwave intensity to be about 10 W/cnV. However, at a microwave frequency of about 0.1 GHz, up to 100 kW/cm2, preferably up to 50 kW/cm2, and more preferably up to 10 kW/cnr is required for rapid heating and destruction of the wood cells. Preferred ranges of microwave frequency (f) and power intensity (p) are from about f=0 4 GHz and p = 6 kW/cm2 to about f= 10 GHz and p=0.24 kW/cm2, more preferably from about f= 1 GHz and p = 2 4 kW/cm2 to about f=6 GHz and p=0.4kW/cnr<br>
The duration of the microwave treatment within ^ne defined frequency and power intensity ranges is in the range of from 0.03 to 600 seconds, preferably 0 1 to 600 seconds, and will generally be less than 250 seconds, preferably less than 100 seconds, more preferably from about 1 to about 20 seconds   The minimum duration of the microwave treatment to increase the permeability of the wood is determined by the power of the microwave generator(s) used. The maximum capacity generator used in the timber industry is generally 500 kW Experiments have shown the highest excessive pressure in the wood for making the radial-longitudinal checks must be about 400 kPa, and from a practical point of view it is difficult to create conditions for increasing the wood permeability during a period of less than 0.05 seconds   A microwave wood treatment of greater than 600 seconds is unlikely to produce good quality wood for impregnation, but longer periods may be used with combinations of very low microwave frequency and power intensity    However, commercially such long periods will not usually be acceptable.<br>
To achieve wood modification (for example improvements in permeability) in different zones in the wood advantageously microwave radiation of different frequencies is used For example, if timber has a cross-section of 100 \ \()0 mm. microwave modification ma\ be achieved using a frequency of 2 4 GHz The wood may subsequently be modified to a depth of 20 mm in which the modification is restricted to the ray cells If a frequency of 0 915 GHz is employed, modification in the central zone of the wood may he effected by modification or destruction of the ray cells and formation of a number of cavities in the radial - longitudinal planes<br>
Wood cells have a maximum absorption of microwave energy if the electric field strength vector E is oriented parallel to the length of the cell Rays are generally aligned in the radial direction (perpendicular to the mam wood tissues (tracheids, libriform) so that the ray cells will have a maximum microwave energy absorption when vector E is oriented in the radial direction With the vector E orientation parallel to the rays and perpendicular to the main wood tissues, the ray cells will heat faster than the other tissues of the wood and absorb more energy which permits the destruction of the ray cells without the destruction of the main wood tissues    The present process may also enable a reduction in energy consumption<br>
The dielectric properties 01 wood are dependent upon the vector E orientation to the mam wood tissue direction The dielectric loss factor or moist wood when vector E is oriented parallel to the main wood tissues has a value about 1 6 to 2 2 times higher than when vector E is oriented perpendicular to the tissues. Furthermore, the microwave penetration depth decreases about 1.5 to 2 times when the orientation of vector E is changed from perpendicular to the main wood tissues to parallel to the tissues, and the absorption ability of wood increases correspondingly Accordingly, the effects of applying the microwave energy to the wood can be controlled by moving the vector E orientation between the preferred perpendicular direction to the wood tissues and parallel to the wood tissues<br>
The use of microwave energy for increasing permeability is most efficient at elevated temperature, and advantageously the method of the invention is performed at a wood temperature of about 80 to about 110Â°C, preferably about 90 to about 100Â°C. The wood may be heated by any suitable means, for example by convection, contact or electroconductive methods Advantageously the wood is heated by means of microwave energ\. for example at a frequency range of about 0 1 to about 24 GH/ w ith a power intensity of from anout 0 1 to about 10 W/cm2 The microwave preheating ina\ r&gt;e carried out over any suitable period for example from about 20 to about 600 seconds<br>
In order to increase the effect of the selective influence of microwave energy on ray cell destruction or resin softening, it may be advantageous at wood temperatures above about<br>
100Â°C to use energy impulses with high energy density This may help to avoid overheating the body of the wood<br>
During high intensity microwave treatment, the surface of timber may be overheated and carbonised To alleviate this, it is desirable to cool the surface using gas or air flow, preferably at speeds of not less than 1 m/sec, more preferably not less than 2 m/sec applying gas or air flow to the surface of the wood may also advantageously remove vapours, dust and moisture from the zone of irradiation and ma\ also avoid moisture condensation in the microwave applicator<br>
For uniform modification, wood may be moved through the zone of microwave irradiation at a constant speed with irradiation with microwaves of particular frequencies In some cases, it may be advantageous to provide wood having treated and untreated zones, or zones with varying degrees of treatment and, therefore, with varying permeability. To control wood modification, whether uniformly or non-uniformly. the intensity and frequency of microwave irradiation can be altered during a treatment as required to provide the desired effect This will be readily determined by those skilled in the an.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a wood-based material formed by microwave treatment of an untreated wood having a moisture content (based on dry-weight) of at least 15%. the wood-based material having a multitude of cavities primarily in the radial-longitudinal planes thereof formed by the full or partial destruction of ray cells and by expanding destroyed rays to cavities during the microwave treatment of the untreated wood, and having permeability in radial and longitudinal directions which is at least 5 times that of the untreated wood, wherein the overall integrity of the untreated wood is substantially maintained in the wood-based material<br>
The wood-based material may be uniform in permeability having the multitude or ca\me&gt; spaced evenly throughout the body of the material However, in another embodiment, the wood-based material has regions which have a high aensn\ of the cavities alternating with<br>
regions which have a low density of the cavities or which do not include any of the cavities. More particularly, the alternating regions may alternate in the longitudinal, radial and/or tangential directions of the wood-based material. Furthermore, the alternating regions may be selectively formed in the wood-based material, or may be random The particular arrangement of these regions will generally depend on the anticipated use of the final product<br>
The increase in permeability of the wood-based material compared with the untreated wood is quite marked As such, the uptake of treatment solution by the wood-based material is also dramatically increased compared with the untreated wood Generally, the wood-based material will have a treatment solution uptake of from about 120 to about 550 (c/m More particularly, the wood-based material will have a copper-chrome-arseruc solution uptake of from about 190 to about 520 f/m3 Additionalh. the wood-based material according to the invention preferably has a good uptake of treatment materials such as, for example, creosote Preferably, after 30 minutes soaking in creosote, the wood-based material according to the invention has an uptake of from about 115 to about 220 kg/m3<br>
The overall integrity of the untreated wood is substantially maintained in the wood-based material according to the invention That is. as discussed above, there is no significant destruction of cells of the main wood tissue in the wood-based material. However, there will generally be a reduction in mechanical properties of the wood-based material compared with those of the untreated wood. In particular, it can be expected that the wood-based material will have decreased modulus of elasticity (MOE) and decreased modulus of rupture (MOR) compared with the untreated wood These factors will be taken into consideration and discussed in further detail in the following examples<br>
The present invention is suitable for round wood, lumber beams and other timber and blank.s of different forms The method of increasing wood permeability can be used before am drying of the wood. The method is suitable for any species of wood, but is especially suitable for hard drying species with a high volume of ray cells, such as English oak<br>
The present invention will now be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of apparatus for performing the process of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a photomicrograph at x 100 magnification illustrating the ray cells of radiata pine wood in tangential section,<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are photomicrographs at x 200 and 700 magnification, respectively, of radiata pine alter microwave treatment in tangential section, and<br>
Figure 5 is a photomicrograph at x 20 magnification of a transverse section of wood after microwave treatment<br>
Referring to Figure 1. the apparatus 10 comprises a microwave generator 12 which directs microwave energy through a waveguide 14 perpendicular to a treatment path 16 defined by conveyor roller pairs 18 and 20 respectively upstream and downstream of the waveguide 14.<br>
The waveguide 14 opens to an upper side of the treatment path 16. and is connected with a water load 22 which absorbs microwave energy which passes through a length 24 of timber<br>
The length 24 of timber is conveyed along the treatment path by the conveyor at a predetermined speed to give the desired treatment time opposite the waveguide 14<br>
The waveguide 14 directs microwaves perpendicularly to the length of timber as shown by arrows 26 Electric field strength vector E, therefore, is oriented perpendicularly to the length of timber (i,e to the main wood tissues) The orientation of vector E may be altered to parallel to the main wood tissues by electrical or mechanical means, as will be recognised by those skilled in the art<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 to 4. the tangential-longituainal sections of the photomicrographs clearly illustrate the grain of the wood and the individual fibres (tracherds) 28 extending from left to right in Figures 2 and 3 and from top to bottom in Figure 4 Also clearly shown are numerous    rays    30   extending   approximate!)    transversely    to   the   section   of   the<br>
photomicrographs Figure 2 is a section of radiata pine taken prior to the microwave treatment, and the individual ray cells in each ray are clearly visible.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4 the sections are of wood which has been subjected to microwave treatment in the apparatus 10 at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, a microwave power intensity of 250 W/cnr for a processing time of 7 seconds to destroy the individual ray cells and thereby increase the permeability of the wood. It is also clear from Figures 2 and 3 that the overall structure or integrity of the wood has been maintained<br>
Resinous channels which extend in the radial-longuudmal planes of the wood nave a high microwave absorption ability relative to the surrounding wood Therefore, on microwa\e treatment the resin softens and melts and, under vapour pressure, is forced to the surface of the wood leaving the channels vacant At least a portion of the resin is also displaced through pores in adjacent wood cells The vacant channels advantageously substantially increase the permeability of the wood and, therefore, the woods susceptibility to chemical penetration<br>
In the transverse section of Figure 5. it is possible to see checks 32 which are formed in radial-longitudinal planes of radiata pine wood alter the wood has been subjected to microwave treatment in the apparatus 10 at a frequency of 2 4 GHZ and power intensity of 500 W/cnr for a duration of 8 seconds<br>

In both of Examples 4 and 5. the permeability of the wood increased substantially without deteriorating the overall structure or integrity of the wood<br>
Using the microwave treatment of the present invention it may be possible to increase the permeability of wood samples up to and above 100 times the permeability of the sample prior to treatment For example, a sample of pine timber treated at a frequency of 2 4 GHz. power intensity of about 10 W/cnr lor 35 seconds increases in temperature to 95-100Â°C \lte; an additional 3 seconds treatment at a power intensity of about 500 W/cm-. ray cells are destroyed and resin soltened and removed to form open pores and thin radial checks and cavities primarily in the radial-longirudinal planes of the sample The permeability of the wood sample m the radial direction is approximate!1. 120 times that of the original untreated sample<br>
The density of the wood following treatment, corresponding to the density of the wood-based material was found to decrease depending on the particular microwave treatment schedule For Radiata pine, the reduction was found to be in the order of up to 15% for Douglas fir, up to 9 4%, and for Messmate, up to 13 4 %<br>
Thus, it is possible to torm a novel wood product, "Torgvin", which has a multitude of cavities disposed in radial-longuudinal planes thereof Furthermore, materials may be produced having treated and untreated zones by irradiating selected areas of sample or by using intermittent or pulse irradiation Materials in accordance with the invention, or produced by the method according to the invention, advantageously have very high permeability, increased flexibility, altered shrinkage and mechanical properties and lowered densities as compared with the natural wood<br>
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.<br>

It is to be understood that the invention includes all such variations and modifications which fall within its spirit and scope The invention also includes all of the steps, features, compositions and compounds referred to or indicated in this specification, individually or collectively, and any and all combinations of  any two or more of said steps or features<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1	A method for increasing the permeability of wood comprises the steps of<br>
-    subjecting wood with a moisture content (based on dry weight) of at least 15% to microwave radiation at a frequency (f) in the range of from 0 1 to 24 GHz with a power intensity (p) from 10 W/cm2 to 100 kW/cm2 for a duration of from 0 05 to 600 seconds to cause water in the wood to vaponze resulting in an internal pressure in the wood such that the permeability of the wood is increased by partial or complete destruction of ray cell tissue softening and displacement of wood resin, formation of pathways in the radial direction of the wood and/or by creating, on the base of destroyed rays cavities in the wood said cavities being primarily in radial-longitudinal planes of the wood, and wherein the overall integrity of the wood is substantially maintained<br>
2	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the electnc field strength vector E of said microwave radiation during treatment of the wood is oriented perpendicularly to the wood grain and preferably parallel to the radial direction of the wood<br>
3	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the electric field strength vector E of said microwave radiation during treatment of the wood is alternated between perpendicular and parallel orientations relative to the wood grain<br>
4	A method as clatmed in claim 1 wherein the wood is subjected to more than one microwave frequency and/or power intensity in a single treatment to provide treated wood having regions of differing or uniform permeability<br>
5	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the microwave radiation is applied to the wood as impulses of predetermined duration and separated by set time intervals or as random impulses to provide treated wood having treated and untreated regions<br><br>
6	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the wood prior to irradiation has a moisture content in the range of from 15% to 200% based on the dry weight of the wood<br>
7	A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the duration of the microwave irradiation is less than 250 seconds<br>
8	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the duration of the microwave irradiation is from 1 to 20 seconds<br>
