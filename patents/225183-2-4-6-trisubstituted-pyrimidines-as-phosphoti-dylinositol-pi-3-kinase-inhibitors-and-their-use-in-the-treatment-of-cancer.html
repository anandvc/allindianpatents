				<td>2,4,6-TRISUBSTITUTED PYRIMIDINES PHOSPHOTIDYLINOSITOL (PI) 3-KINASE INHIBITORS AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CANSER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains generally to the treatment of diseases, such as cancer, characterized by the abnormal activity of growth fectors, protein serine/threonine kinases,<br>
inhibitors of phosphotidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, pharmaceutical formulations containing such inhibitors, methods of treating patients with such pharmaceutical formulations, and to methods of preparing such phannaceutical formulations and inhibitors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is both a phospholipid kinase, and a protein serine/threonine kinase as described in Carpenter et al, Mol. Cell Biol 13:1657-1665 (1993). PI3K is an enzyme stimulated by growth factors that is responsible for phosphorylating phosphotidylinositol (PI) at the D-3' position of the inositol ring as described in Whitman et al, Nature 332:644-646 (1988). PI3K association with Src-like or receptor tyrosine kinases also implicates PDK in the oncogenic or mitogenic responses induced by these protein kinases, as described in Cantley et al, Cell 64:281-302 (1991), Escobedo and Williams, Nature 335:85-87 (1988), and Fantl et al, Cell 69:413-423 (1992).<br>
Previously, studies to elucidate the downstream effects of PI 3-kinase activation have been conducted with receptor mutants constructed to alter the signal transduction of PI3K, or by constructing mutant oncogenes to study a PDK inducible oncogenic response. The failure of receptor mutants of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor to activate PDK has been correlated with deficiency of the receptor mutants in triggering a mitogenic response. Similarly, mutants of certain oncogenes have failed to trigger the oncogenic transformation inducible by the parent oncogene. A method was subsequently constructed to facilitate downstream effects of PDK directly, without growth fector activation to determine whether PDK was distinctly involved oncogenesis and mitogenesis. The results elucidated that PDK can be directly or indirectly responsible for many cellular processes, such as mitogenesis and oncogenesis, as well as histamine secretion, neutrophil activation, platelet activation, cell migration, glucose transport, antilipolysis, and vesicle sorting.<br>
With the many regulatory responses associated with PI3-kinase, which is known to be involved in signal cascades involving other well know oncogenic proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., VEGF-RTK), it would be highly desirable to produce small molecules capable of modulating, e.g. inhibiting, the activity of PI3-kinase. <br>
It is an object of this invention to provide potent inhibitors of PI3K. It is further<br>
other known agents to modulate cellular proliferation in patients in need thereof. Additionally, it is an object of this invention to provide medicaments for use in the treatment cancer.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxichy, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term "prodrug" refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided hi T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible<br>
Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, "limit", "treat" and "treatment" are interchangeable terms as are "limiting" and "treating" and, as used herein, include preventative (e.g., prophylactic) and palliative treatment or the act of providing preventative or palliative treatment<br>
Treating" Within the context of the instant invention, means an alleviation of <br>
symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or halt of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or prophylaxis of the disease or disorder. For example, within the context of treating patients in need of an inhibitor of PI3K, successful treatment may include a reduction in the proliferation of cappilaries<br>
an alleviation of symptoms related to a cancerous growm or tumor, proliferation of capillaries, or diseased tissue, a halting in capillary proliferation, or a halting in me progression of a disease such as cancer or in the growth of cancerous cells. Treatment may also include administering the pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention in combination with other therapies. For example, the compounds and pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may be administered before, during, or after surgical procedure and/or radiation therapy. The compounds of the invention can also be administered in conjunction with other anti-cancer drugs including those used in antisense and gene therapy.<br>
The PI3K inhibitors of this invention, as described herein, can be administered in the form of add addition salts. The salts are conveniently formed by reacting a compound, if basic, with a suitable acid, such as have been described above. The salts are quickly formed in high yields at moderate temperatures, and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash as the final step of the synthesis. The salt-forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form, it is isolated from a basic final wash step, according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it It will also be recognized that it is possible to administer amorphous forms of the PI3K inhibitors.<br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled PI3K inhibitors, which are structurally identical to those disclosed above, but for the fact that one or more atoms<br>
are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes mat can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, l5N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36O, respectively. Compounds of the present<br>
of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as *H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., MC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out known or referenced procedures and by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent<br>

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a phosphotidylinositol 3-ldnase inhibitor compound described herein formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as com starch and<br>
potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipiento such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar, buffering agents such as magnesium<br>
Singer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-tone compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraparitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray, or a liquid aerosol or dry powder formulation for inhalation.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylfonnamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene giycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally<br>
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglyceridos. In addition, fatty adds such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by Incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
injectable medium prior to use.<br>
In order to prolong me effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed<br>
form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations may also be prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulasions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>

Further, the formulation preferably has balanced osmolarity ionic strength and chloride concentration, and the smallest aerosolizable volume able to deliver effective dose of the compounds of the invention to me site of the infection. Additionally, me aerosolized formulation preferably does not impair negatively the functionality of the airways and does not cause undesirable side<br>
effects.<br>
Aerosolization devices suitable for administration of aerosol formulations of the invention include, for example, jet, vibrating porous plate, ultrasonic nebulizers and energized dry powder inhalers, that are able to nebulize the formulation of the invention into aerosol particle size predominantly in the size range from 1-5 µ. Predominantly in this application means that at least 70% but preferably more than 90% of all generated aerosol particles are within 1-5 µ range.. A jet nebulizer works by air pressure to break a liquid solution into aerosol droplets. Vibrating porous plate nebulizers work by using a sonic vacuum produced by a rapidly vibrating porous plate to extrude a solvent droplet through a porous plate. An ultrasonic nebulizer works by a piezoelectric crystal that shears a liquid into small aerosol droplets. A variety of suitable devices are available,<br>
including, for example AeroNeb™ and AeroDose™ vibrating porous plate nebulizers (AeroGen, Inc., Sunnyvale, California), Sidestream® nebulizes (Medic-Aid Ltd., West Sussex, England), Pari LC® and Pan LC Star® jet nebulizers (Pan Respiratory Equipment, Inc., Richmond, Virginia), and Aerosonic™ (DeVilbiss Medizinische Produkte (Deutscaland) GmbH, Heiden, Germany) and UhraAire® (Omron Healthcare, Inc., Vernon Hills, Illinois) ultrasonic nebulizers.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be formulated for use as topical powders and sprays that can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.<br>

Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase me flux .of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, tumor growth is reduced or prevented in a patient such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result By a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat tumor growth, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of fectors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of admmistration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like fectors well known in the medical arts.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other mammal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or in more usually from 0.1 to25mg/kg body weight Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 2000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.<br>
Methods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa, 19th Edition (1995). Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present invention can be in the form of sterile, non-pyrogenic liquid solutions or suspensions, coated capsules, suppositories, lyophilized powders, transdermal patches or other forms known in the art<br>
A "kit" as used in the instant application comprises a container for containing the pharmaceutical compositions and may also include divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a phannaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a resealable bag (for example, to hold a "refill" of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. it is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle which is in turn contained within a box.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packagmg of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tablets and/or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of<br>
relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the fece of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a written memory aid, where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or other health care provider, or subject, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby me numbers correspond with the days of the regumen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or a card which contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, eg., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday,"... etc ... "Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, ..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apperent A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. When the kit contains separate compositions, a daily dose of one or more compositions of the kit can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of another one or more compositions of the lot can consist of several tablets or capsules.<br>
Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter, which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed.

Example 162 4-Substituted Pyrimidinyl Compounds<br>
Modifications in the 4- position of the pyrimidinyl core can be accomplished starting from the 4- ester moiety, as shown in Scheme 1 below. The ester 1 can be reduced to the alcohol 2 and then reoxydized to the corresponding aldehyde 3. The aldehyde can be used as a substrate for reductive amination with primary or secondary amines to afford 4-alkyl (or dialkyl)ammomethyl substituted pyrimidines 4 (representative procedure given below). As an alternate route, alcohol 2 can be converted to a good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate (5) triflate and the like, and reacted with suitable nucleophiles such as primary or secondary amines, alcohols, thiols. As an additional alternate route the ester can be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, which can be<br>
easily coupled with a variety of primary and secondary amines to afford 4-amides 6. Reduction of the amide will afford the desired 4- alkyl (or dialkyl)aminomemyl substituted pyrimidines 4 (see scheme 1). Compound 1 and its analogs can be obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of suitable aldehydes with ethyl acetoacetate, followed by oxidation of the dihydropyrimidine core with DDQ, with a procedure essentially identical to the one used in the Solid phase synthesis of this class of compounds (other known agents e.g. CAN, can also be used in the aromatization step).<br>
