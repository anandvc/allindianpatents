				<td>FIELD<br>
 The present disclosure relates to diagnostic systems for<br>
vehicles, and more particularly to methods and systems for monitoring<br>
catalytic converter efficiency.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
 Ethanol, also know as ethyl alcohol, is a flammable, colorless<br>
chemical compound that can be mixed with gasoline to fuel an internal<br>
combustion engine. Flexible fuel vehicles include adaptations that allow the<br>
vehicle to run on various blends of gasoline and ethanol. For example, E85<br>
fuel contains a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. A virtual flex fuel<br>
sensor and method detects the concentration of ethanol in the fuel. Based on<br>
the concentration level, the air/fuel ratio is adjusted and the engine operation<br>
is controlled accordingly.<br>
 During the combustion process, gasoline and ethanol are<br>
oxidized and hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) combine with air. Various<br>
chemical compounds are formed and released in an exhaust stream including<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H20), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides<br>
(NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other<br>
compounds. However, the use of ethanol in the fuel reduces the amount of<br>
carbon dioxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust.<br><br>
 Automobile exhaust systems include a catalytic converter<br>
that further reduces the levels of CO, HC, and NOx in the exhaust gas by<br>
chemically converting these gasses into carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water.<br>
Diagnostic regulations require periodic monitoring of the catalytic converter for<br>
proper conversion capability. Typical monitoring methods employ two<br>
exhaust gas oxygen sensors and infer the conversion capability of the<br>
catalytic converter using the sensor signals. One sensor monitors the oxygen<br>
level associated with an inlet exhaust stream of the catalytic converter. This<br>
inlet O2 sensor is also the primary feedback mechanism that maintains the<br>
fuel-to-air (F/A) ratio of the engine at the chemically correct, or stoichiometric<br>
F/A ratio needed to support the catalytic conversion processes. A second or<br>
outlet O2 sensor monitors the oxygen level concentration of the exhaust<br>
stream exiting the catalytic converter. Excess O2 concentration in the exiting<br>
exhaust stream induces a "lean" sensor signal. A deficit or absence of O2 in<br>
the exiting exhaust stream induces a "rich" sensor signal.<br>
 Traditional catalytic converter monitoring methods relate the<br>
empirical relationships that exist between the inlet and outlet O2 sensor to<br>
quantify catalyst conversion capability. These methods compare sensor<br>
amplitude, response time, response rate, and/or frequency content data. All<br>
of these measurements are affected by a property of a catalytic converter<br>
known as Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC). OSC refers to the ability of a<br>
catalytic converter to store excess oxygen under lean conditions and to<br>
release oxygen under rich conditions. The amount of oxygen storage and<br>
release decreases as the conversion capability of the catalytic converter is<br>
reduced. Therefore, the loss in OSC is related to the loss in conversion<br>
capability.<br><br>
 Methods and systems for monitoring a catalytic converter<br>
based on the OSC are described in commonly assigned U.S. patent no.<br>
6,874,313. The methods and systems relate to various types of hydrocarbon<br>
fuels. As implemented, the methods and systems may not properly diagnose<br>
a catalytic converter for engine systems running alternative fuels such as E85<br>
or diesel.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
 Accordingly, a monitoring system for a catalytic converter is<br>
provided. The system includes: a fuel determination module that determines<br>
a fuel type based on a composition of fuel in a fuel system; a fuel/air (F/A)<br>
determination module that selectively determines a stoichiometric F/A ratio<br>
based on the fuel type; and an oxygen storage capacity (OSC) diagnostic<br>
module that computes a target OSC based on the stoichiometric F/A ratio,<br>
that compares the target OSC to a reference value and diagnosis the catalytic<br>
converter based on the comparison.<br>
 In other features, a method of diagnosing a catalytic<br>
converter is provided. The method includes: selectively determining a<br>
stoichiometric fuel/air ratio based on a fuel type; computing a target oxygen<br>
storage capacity (OSC) of the catalytic converter based on the stoichiometric<br>
fuel/air ratio; and diagnosing the catalytic converter based on the oxygen<br>
storage capacity.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference<br>
numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described<br>
functionality.<br><br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, a vehicle 10 includes an engine<br>
12, an exhaust system 14, and a control module 16. The engine 12 includes<br>
an intake manifold 17, a throttle position sensor (TPS) 18, and a mass air flow<br>
(MAF) sensor 20. The throttle position sensor 18 and the MAF sensor 20<br>
communicate with the control module 16. The exhaust system 14 includes a<br>
catalytic converter 22, a pre-catalyst or inlet oxygen sensor 24, and a post-<br>
catalyst or outlet oxygen sensor 26. The inlet and outlet oxygen sensors 24,<br>
26 communicate with the control module 16 to provide inlet and outlet F/A<br>
ratio signals, respectfully. The control module 16 communicates with a fuel<br>
system 28 to regulate fuel flow to the engine 12. The fuel system includes a<br>
flex fuel sensor 29. The flex fuel sensor 29 generates a fuel signal to the<br>
control module 16 indicating a composition of the fuel in the fuel system 28.<br>
Alternatively, the vehicle may employ a virtual flex fuel sensor method in the<br>
control module 16 that utilizes a learned shift in fuel trim calculated from the<br>
inlet oxygen sensor 24 to estimate the fuel composition. In this manner, the<br>
control module 16 determines or estimates the stoichiometric F/A ratio of the<br>
engine 12. In addition, the control module 16 diagnoses the catalytic<br>
converter 22 of the exhaust system 14 based on a flexible fuel tolerant<br>
catalytic converter diagnostic method described herein.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, a dataflow diagram illustrates<br>
various embodiments of a flexible fuel tolerant catalytic converter diagnostic<br>
system that may be embedded within the control module 16. Various<br>
embodiments of catalytic converter diagnostic systems according to the<br>
present disclosure may include any number of sub-modules embedded within<br>
the control module 16. The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or<br>
further partitioned to similarly monitor a catalytic converter 22. Inputs to the<br>
system may be received from sensors within the vehicle 10, received from<br>
other control modules (not shown) within the vehicle 10, and/or determined by<br>
other sub-modules (not shown) within the control module 16. In various<br>
embodiments, the control module 16 of Figure 2 includes an enable module<br><br>
40, a fuel determination module 42, a fuel/air (F/A) ratio module 44, and an<br>
oxygen storage capacity (OSC) diagnostic module 46.<br>
 The enable module 40 receives as input a fuel event signal<br>
48. The fuel event signal 48 indicates a status of the remaining fuel in the fuel<br>
system 28 (Figure 1). The enable module 40 determines when a refuel event<br>
has occurred based on the fuel event signal 48 and sets a refuel event flag 50<br>
accordingly. In various embodiments, the fuel event signal 48 indicates a<br>
current fuel level of the fuel system 28 (Figure 1). The enable module 40<br>
compares the current fuel level to a previous fuel level to determine when a<br>
refuel event occurs. It is appreciated, that other methods may be used to<br>
detect a refuel event. The fuel determination module 42 receives as input the<br>
refuel event flag 50 and a fuel sensor signal 52 indicating a composition of the<br>
fuel in the fuel system 28 (Figure 1). The fuel determination module 42<br>
determines a fuel composition 54 of the fuel in the fuel system 28 (Figure 1)<br>
after a refuel event has occurred and based on the fuel sensor signal 52. In<br>
various embodiments, the fuel determination module 42 estimates a<br>
composition of fuel based on engine operating parameters (i.e., fuel trim shift<br>
values) and determines the fuel composition 54 based on the estimated<br>
composition. These methods eliminate the need for the fuel sensor signal 52. The F/A ratio module 44 receives as input the fuel<br>
composition 54. Based on the fuel composition 54, the F/A ratio module 44<br>
determines the ideal stoichiometric F/A ratio 56. The OSC diagnostic module<br>
46 receives as input the stoichiometric F/A ratio 56, mass airflow (MAF) 58,<br>
throttle position (TPS) 60, inlet O2 sensor signal 62 and the outlet O2 sensor<br>
signal 64. Based on the received signals, the OSC diagnostic module 46<br>
determines an oxygen storage capacity for the catalytic converter 22 (Figure<br>
1) and diagnosis the catalytic converter 22 (Figure 1) based on a comparison<br>
of the determined OSC and a reference value. Based on the diagnosis, the<br>
OSC diagnostic module 46 sets a failure code 66. Wherein the failure code<br>
66 is set to TRUE or "test fail" if a malfunction is diagnosed.<br><br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, a flowchart illustrates a flexible<br>
fuel tolerant catalytic converter diagnostic method performed by the control<br>
module 16. The method may be run periodically during engine operation.<br>
Control evaluates whether a refuel event has occurred at 90. If a refuel event<br>
has occurred, the diagnosis is delayed until an accurate determination of the<br>
fuel composition is made at 92. Otherwise control proceeds to evaluate the<br>
current fuel composition at 94. If the fuel composition is of a typical fixed<br>
hydrocarbon mixture at 94, the stoichiometric F/A ratio is set based on a<br>
predetermined value at 96. If the fuel composition is of an alternative fuel<br>
mixture of more than one typical hydrocarbon, such as E85 (85% ethyl alcohol<br>
blended with 15% gasoline), the stoichiometric F/A ratio is computed based<br>
on the composition of the fuel mixture at 98. After setting the F/A ratio, control<br>
proceeds to perform the OSC diagnostic at 99.<br>
 More particularly, the details of the OSC diagnostic module<br>
46 of Figure 2 and the process step 99 of Figure 3 will be discussed in the<br>
context of Figures 4-7. Referring to Figure 4, a simplified chemical<br>
combustion model for hydrocarbon and alternative fuels will be described in<br>
detail. The combustion model is based on an equivalence ratio (FR) that is<br>
defined as the actual F/A ratio (F/AACT) divided by the determined<br>
stoichiometric F/A ratio (F/ASTOICH). During periods of O2 release (i.e. rich<br>
engine operation), the chemical combustion model is provided as:<br><br>
During periods of O2 storage, the chemical combustion model is provided as:<br><br><br>
Where a, u, v, x are coefficients. The coefficient a represents a simplification<br>
contsant determined from the following equation:<br><br>
The coefficient u represents the ratio of the alcohol in the fuel mixture of the<br>
total fuel mixture. The coefficient v represents the number of carbon atoms in<br>
a molecule of the alcohol fuel. The coefficient x represents the number of<br>
carbon atoms in a molecule of the non-alcohol hydrocarbon fuel. The<br>
coefficient y represents the hydrogen atoms in a molecule of the non-alcohol<br>
hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
 Periods of 02 release require the catalyst to release 1/2 Mole<br>
of 02 for each Mole of excess CO in the exhaust to completely convert the<br>
CO. Periods of 02 storage require the catalyst to store one mole of 02 for<br>
each mole of excess 02 in the exhaust. The ratio of 02 released by the<br>
catalyst to the mass of inlet 02 in the F/A charge mixture is given as:<br><br>
A positive term indicates 02 release and a negative term indicates 02 storage. As seen in the graph of Figure 4, when FR is greater than 1<br>
(i.e. rich engine operation), stored 02 within the catalytic converter 22 is<br>
released. When FR is less than 1 (i.e. lean engine operation), excess 02 is<br>
stored. The rate of 02 released to the mass air rate associated with the F/A<br>
mixture is provided as:<br>
  grams per sec/ Air grams per sec<br>
M02 is the mass of 02 in a mole of air. MAIR is the average molar mass of air.<br>
The molar ratio of 02 to that of air is assumed to be a constant.<br><br>
 The OSC diagnostic is executed during a fuel cut-off mode of<br>
the engine 12. The fuel cut-off mode occurs during a vehicle overrun<br>
condition, such as when the vehicle 10 is coasting downhill. The fuel cutoff<br>
mode can be determined from the throttle position 60 and intake manifold<br>
pressure. While in the fuel cut-off mode, the F/A ratio of the exhaust stream<br>
from the engine 12 is equal to zero. The OSC diagnostic is initiated after the<br>
engine 12 has operated in the fuel cut-off mode for a predetermined period of<br>
time and is signaled to return to normal operation (or non fuel cut-off mode).<br>
More specifically, the predetermined time period is calibrated to completely<br>
saturate the catalytic converter 22 with oxygen.<br>
 Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, time t=0 indicates the<br>
beginning of the OSC diagnostic. Initially, FR is commanded to a fixed<br>
percentage rich. Commanding the equivalence ratio a fixed percentage rich<br>
results in F/AACT being greater than F/ASTOICH- AS the engine 12 operates rich,<br>
the inlet oxygen sensor 24 detects the transition to rich and correspondingly<br>
signals the control module 16. The delay time required for the inlet oxygen<br>
sensor 24 to achieve a reference signal is indicated as tinlet delay. The<br>
reference signal indicates when the exhaust from the engine 12 achieves<br>
F/ASTOICH- The outlet oxygen sensor 26 detects the transition to rich and<br>
correspondingly signals the control module 16. The outlet oxygen sensor<br>
signal 64 is delayed relative to the inlet oxygen sensor signal 62. The<br>
transition time required for the outlet oxygen sensor 26 to achieve the<br>
reference signal is indicated as toulet delay The lag time required for a<br>
predetermined amount of air (such as approximately 1.5g) to flow through an<br>
inert catalytic converter 22 (Figure 1) is indicated as tlag.<br><br>
 The OSC diagnostic module 46 (Figure 2) determines a<br>
target time over which a target OSC of the catalytic converter 22 (Figure 1) is<br>
calculated. The target time, indicated as target, is based on tinlet delay, toutlet delay,<br>
and tlag. More specifically, the OSC diagnostic module 46 monitors the inlet<br>
and outlet sensor signals 62, 64 to determine tinlet delay and toutlet delay The OSC<br>
diagnostic module 46 estimates tlag as the interval of time required to pass a<br>
fixed mass of air between the oxygen sensors as:<br>
tlag= K air_mass_grams/ MAF(tend-of-test)<br>
This process assumes that exhaust flow conditions toward the end-of-test are<br>
known. Referring to Figure 4, the end-of-test time can be estimated as:<br><br>
This instant in time will vary with the OSC of the catalyst and cannot be<br>
determined until after the test conditions have passed. Also, the mass flow<br>
rate of air is transient in nature during the diagnostic and cannot be assumed<br>
to be constant. For these reasons, MAF 58 is averaged over fixed duration<br>
subintervals of the transition period and stored. The estimated lag period is<br>
then calculated by a backwards integration of the stored MAF 58 terms<br>
beginning at t= tend-of-test and ending when the summation equals K<br>
air_mass_grams. By definition, this occurs at t= tend-of-test- tlag . The target<br>
time is provided as:<br><br>
The target time is the time period immediately after F/A becoming greater<br>
than the stoichiometric F/A 56.<br>
 In addition to monitoring the above-described times, the OSC<br>
diagnostic module 46 stores subinterval averages of the mass air flow (MAF)<br>
into the engine 12 and an FR compensated MAF term (see Figure 6). The<br>
subinterval is defined as an integer multiple of the data sample rate<br>
associated with the MAF and FR terms. This method does not preclude<br>
having the subinterval equal the sample rate and subinterval average based<br><br>
on a single value. However, a more efficient use of control module memory<br>
can be obtained without significantly affecting the accuracy of the OSC<br>
calculation by specifying a larger subinterval. The MAF 58 is provided as a<br>
signal to the control module 16 from the MAF sensor 20. The incremental<br>
OSC, derived from the simplified O2 release model, is represented by the<br>
following relationship:<br><br>
where the incremental OSC is measured in terms of grams of stored oxygen<br>
per unit time, a is the mass of oxygen in a mole of air divided by the mass of a<br>
mole of air, and p is the mass air flow fraction per catalytic converter.<br>
Preferably, for an exhaust system having a single catalytic converter 22 as<br>
shown in Figure 1, β is equal to 1. For an exhaust system having a catalytic<br>
converter for each N/2 cylinders, β is equal to 0.5. The OSC at ttarget is<br>
represented by the numerical integration, or summation, of the incremental<br>
OSC over the target period:<br><br>
where T represents the sampled data period, MAF(nT) represents the MAF at<br>
time nT, and FR(nT) represents the fuel equivalence ratio at time nT. A<br>
prefered equivalent form of this relationship is represented by:<br><br>
This form is less prone to numerical accumulation of small round-off errors.<br>
 Once the outlet oxygen sensor 26 achieves the reference<br>
signal (i.e. detects F/ASTOICH of the exhaust gases from the catalytic<br>
converter), the OSC diagnostic module 46 determines the target OSC.<br>
Referring again to Figure 6, to determine the target OSC, the OSC diagnostic<br>
module 46 calculates the OSC according to the prefered OSC relationship<br>
stated previously. The OSC diagnostic module 46 integrates both the stored<br>
FR compensated MAF and stored MAF measurements over the target time.<br>
This corresponds to the area under each of their respective curves. The<br>
difference between these areas, graphically represented by the area between<br><br>
the two curves, is then multiplied by the constant term, α x β x T to obtain the<br>
OSC over the target period. The constant term acts as a scalar that optionally<br>
could be omitted if an unscaled result was desirable. The calculated OSC is<br>
compared to a reference OSC value to determine if the catalytic converter 22<br>
passes or fails.<br>
 Referring to Figure 7, a flowchart illustrates an OSC<br>
diagnostic method performed by the OSC diagnostic module 46 of Figure 2<br>
and shown in process step 99 of Figure 3. Control determines whether a fuel<br>
cut-off mode is present at 100. If a fuel cut-off mode is not present, control<br>
loops back. Otherwise, control checks particular conditions at 102, 104, and<br>
106 prior to initiating monitoring. At 102, control determines whether the<br>
engine 12 has been operating under closed loop fuel control (CLFC) for a<br>
sufficient time. If not, control loops back to monitor for a fuel cut-off mode at<br>
100. If the engine 12 has been operating under CLFC for a sufficient time,<br>
control determines whether the catalytic converter 22 has achieved an<br>
operating temperature at 104. If the temperature has not been achieved at<br>
104, control loops back to 100. If the temperature has been achieved, control<br>
continues at 106. At 106, control determines whether the catalytic converter<br>
22 has been exposed to air flow for a time sufficient to achieve oxygen<br>
saturation. If the catalytic converter 22 has not been sufficiently exposed,<br>
control loops back to 100. If the catalytic converter 22 has been sufficiently<br>
exposed, control initiates the OSC diagnostic upon the engine 12 exiting the<br>
fuel cut-off mode at 108.<br>
 Upon exiting the fuel cut-off mode, control commands FR to a<br>
fixed percentage rich at 110. At 112, control continually records subinterval<br>
measurements of the MAF and FR compensated MAF using the MAF sensor<br>
20 as explained above. At 114, control tracks the signals of the inlet and<br>
outlet oxygen sensors 24, 26. At 116, control determines whether the outlet<br>
oxygen sensor 26 has achieved the reference signal. If the outlet oxygen<br>
sensor 26 has achieved the reference signal, control continues at 118. If not,<br>
control loops back to 112. At 118, control determines toutlet delay, tinlet delay, tlag<br><br>
and ttarget therefrom. At 124, control integrates the stored OSC related<br>
quantities over the target time and obtains the target OSC value using the<br>
preferred difference equation provided above. At 126, control evaluates the<br>
target OSC value. If the target OSC is not above a reference value, test<br>
failure is indicated at 128. If the target OSC is above the reference value, test<br>
pass is indicated at 122.<br>
