Process for Preparing Amino Acids using the<br>
Amidocarbonylation Reaction (1)<br>
The present invention relates to a sequence for the<br>
preparation of amino acids, for example alpha-amino acids,<br>
in particular methionine, by making use of an<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction. During the process, an N-acyl<br>
amino acid is synthesised in an amidocarbonylation reaction<br>
by making use of a catalyst, and this N-acyl amino acid is<br>
then subsequently hydrolysed to the desired amino acid<br>
while the carboxylic acid thereby formed is reconverted to<br>
the corresponding carboxylic acid amide by reaction with<br>
ammonia, followed by dehydration. This carboxylic acid<br>
amide can then be re-introduced as a starting material in<br>
the initial amidocarbonylation reaction step. According to<br>
the invention, the catalyst used during the first reaction<br>
step can be recovered and recycled into the first reactor<br>
vessel. The synthesis can be conducted in a batch,<br>
semi-batch or preferably in a continuous manner.<br>
Amino acids are important products and are correspondingly<br>
used in a variety of applications, such as human medicine,<br>
the pharmaceuticals industry as well as in the synthesis of<br>
a plurality of fine chemicals and active ingredients. In<br>
particular they are used as additives in the fodder of many<br>
livestock in enantiomerically pure form, but also in the<br>
racemic form.<br>
Several methods are employed on an industrial scale to<br>
prepare amino acids, such as biotechnological processes, as<br>
for example fermentation processes, and hydrolysis of<br>
proteins. Chemical syntheses are also used for producing<br>
amino acids. One possibility is the Strecker reaction or<br>
its variants, such as the Bucherer-Bergs reaction. Still<br>
further, the amidocarbonylation reaction is also known to<br>
be used for preparing amino acids.<br><br>
The amidocarbonylation reaction was discovered by Wakamatsu<br>
et al. in 1971 and is disclosed in the German patent<br>
application DE-A-2115985. The reaction is catalysed by<br>
various transition metal compounds and is a three component<br>
reaction between a carboxylic acid amide, an aldehyde and<br>
carbon monoxide, either in a pure form or as a mixture with<br>
hydrogen (synthesis gas) (see Scheme 1).<br><br>
One should bear in mind that the utilisation of the<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction is to be regarded as<br>
advantageous in comparison to the conventional Strecker<br>
synthesis of amino acids or its variants since the<br>
amidocarbonylation requires carbon monoxide instead of<br>
hydrogen cyanide as one of its integral raw materials. This<br>
is of considerable advantage due to the higher price and in<br>
particular due to the high toxicity of hydrogen cyanide..<br>
The products of the amidocarbonylation reaction are N-acyl<br>
amino acids, having the general formula:<br><br>
R1-CH (NH-CO-R2 ) COOH<br>
R1 is: hydrogen, a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl<br>
group that has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
especially 1 to 7, or<br>
a linear or branched alkyl group that has from 1<br>
to 10, especially 1 to 6 carbon atoms containing<br>
a substituent(s) amido, amino, monoalkylamino,<br>
dialkylamino, monoalkylamido, dialkylamido<br>
alkoxy, alkylthio, hydroxy, thiol, carboxylic<br>
acid or carboxylic acid alkyl ester group(s), or<br>
a 1H-imidazole-, phenyl- or 3'-indolyl-, p-<br>
hydroxyphenyl or p-alkoxyphenyl residue, whereby<br>
the said alkyl (alkoxy) group(s) has (have) 1 to<br>
3 carbon atoms,<br>
most preferred for R1 is a linear or branched<br>
alkyl group' that has from 1 to 10, especially 1<br>
to 6 carbon atoms containing a substituent(s)<br>
amido, alkoxy, alkylthio or a phenyl or p-<br>
alkoxyphenyl residue, whereby the said alkyl<br>
group(s) has 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
R2 is: hydrogen or a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or<br>
a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl group having 1<br>
to 10 carbon atoms, containing a substituent(s)<br>
amido, monoalkylamido, dialkylamido hydroxy,<br>
alkyoxy, thioalkoxy group(s)or<br>
a substituted or non-substituted aryl or benzyl<br>
group, where the substituent(s) may be a hydroxy,<br>
alkoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo or a trialkylamino<br>
group, whereby the said alkyl group has 1 to 3<br>
carbon atoms.<br><br>
The said N-acyl amino acids are starting materials<br>
especially for the α-amino acids:<br>
asparagine, aspartic acid, cystein, glutamine, glutamic<br>
acid, histidine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine,<br>
most especially for alanine, glycine isoleucine, leucine,<br>
methionine, phenylalanine, valine.<br>
Substituted hydantoins can also be prepared instead of<br>
N-acyl amino acids. In such a case, ureas are used as<br>
starting materials, as for example disclosed in the<br>
European patent application EP 1 048 656 A2 .<br>
The European patent application EP 338 330 A1 and the<br>
German patent application DE 19629717 also disclose the<br>
synthesis of various N-acyl amino acids via the<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction. DE 4415712 and DE 195456416<br>
deal with that reaction as well, for example in the case of<br>
the industrial preparation of sarcosinates.<br>
However, no prior art suggests a process to prepare amino<br>
acids, in particular methionine, comprising of the<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction, hydrolysis of the JV-acyl amino<br>
acid formed, reuse of the catalyst and solvent from the<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction and conversion of the<br>
carboxylic acid formed during hydrolysis into a carboxylic<br>
acid amide to be reused in the first step.<br>
With regard to this one should note that the aspect of<br>
catalyst recycling of the expensive transition metal<br>
catalyst used in the amidocarbonylation is also an<br>
important target from an economic point of view, that is<br>
avoiding the high costs involved in the acquisition of new<br>
catalyst and the disposal of spent catalyst. Recycling of<br>
the catalyst is furthermore advantageous with respect to<br>
environmental reasons due to the often high toxicity of<br>
transition metals and compounds related thereto.<br><br>
A process for the recovery of cobalt carbonyl catalysts is<br>
for example described in the European patent EP 779 102 B1.<br>
According to that prior art, the active catalyst was<br>
initially oxidised after the reaction to the more stable<br>
cobalt(II) form, which was then extracted into aqueous<br>
solution, precipitated as the hydroxide and subsequently<br>
converted into a melt consisting of the hydroxide and N-<br>
acyl amino derivative which can be used for regeneration of<br>
the active catalyst under a synthesis gas atmosphere.<br>
However, the same disadvantage as mentioned above occurs<br>
according to that prior art. For example, handling problems<br>
occur during the precipitation and drying of cobalt<br>
hydroxide. Still further, if the process were to be run in<br>
a continuous way, higher expenses would be incurred.<br>
Summing up, the processes suggested in the prior art for<br>
catalyst recovery during an amidocarbonylation reaction are<br>
not suitable for the large scale industrial synthesis of<br>
amino acids, especially methionine, due to the variety of<br>
handling problems, occurring in particular for such amino<br>
acids containing sulphur, as methionine.<br>
There is, however, a strong need to find a way to recycle<br>
the catalyst used during the synthesis of amino acids via<br>
the amidocarbonylation. The carbonyl catalyst makes it<br>
possible to make use of carbon monoxide as a starting<br>
material, which is easier to handle and more widely<br>
available than hydrogen cyanide.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an<br>
amidocarbonylation reaction for producing amino acids<br>
providing a method of reusing and recycling the catalyst<br>
employed in the amidocarbonylation reaction to increase the<br>
efficiency of the amidocarbonylation reaction and to limit<br>
harmful emissions and environmental damage.<br>
These objects have been solved by a process as disclosed in<br>
the patent claims. The process is also suited for producing<br><br>
sulphur containing amino acids, such as methionine, which<br>
might be expected to cause problems with the transition<br>
metal catalyst.<br>
Catalyst recycling means preferably recovery and reuse of<br>
the catalyst, specifically after removal of the product<br>
from the reaction mixture, and reuse of the recovered<br>
catalyst. According to an aspect of the invention,<br>
regeneration of the catalyst from the reaction solution<br>
takes place by means of a chemical conversion into an<br>
intermediate, from which the active catalyst can be later<br>
regenerated, if necessary in a further separate step, and<br>
reused. According to the invention the catalyst is<br>
separated, recovered and subsequently reused.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the preparation<br>
of amino acids occurs in a continuous manner. A<br>
particularly preferred process is directed to the<br>
production of methionine.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
a)	Amidocarbonylation of an aldehyde with a carboxylic<br>
acid amide to give an N-acyl amino acid in the<br>
presence of a transition metal catalyst, carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen,<br>
b)	recovery of the formed N-acyl amino acid from the<br>
reaction mixture; and<br>
c)	hydrolysis of the said N-acyl amino acid in an aqueous<br>
medium to obtain the corresponding amino acid; and<br>
d)	reuse of the remaining reaction mixture of step a),<br>
comprising the catalyst and solvent is after<br>
separation of said N-acyl amino acid by feeding into<br>
the amidocarbonylation step a), optionally after<br><br>
supplementing any lost amount of solvent and spent<br>
catalyst; and<br>
e) in a preferred case, reaction of the carboxylic acid<br>
resulting from hydrolysis with ammonia, resulting in<br>
the regeneration of the carboxylic acid amide to be<br>
used in step a),.<br>
This overall process is illustrated in Figure 1 for the<br>
preferred case of methionine synthesis. As apparent from<br>
Figure 1, the raw materials required are an aldehyde, for<br>
the case of methionine synthesis as demonstrated in Figure<br>
1, 3-(methylthio)propanal, carbon monoxide and ammonia. The<br>
ammonia is transported into the reaction in the form of<br>
acetamide used in step a) and has the function of a<br>
nitrogen carrier. Acetic acid formed during the hydrolysis<br>
step is reconverted into acetamide by reaction with ammonia<br>
and subsequent dehydration.<br>
The hydrolysis occurring during step c) is known to the<br>
skilled person and is, for example, disclosed in the patent<br>
application WO 02/14260. Details of the regeneration<br>
reaction step of the amide can be taken from EP 919 539 A1.<br>
In the first step the aldehyde and amide are mixed in a<br>
solvent under an inert atmosphere. The molar ratio of the<br>
aldehyde to the amide can be in the range of 1:1 to 1:5,<br>
preferably in the range of 1:1 to 1:1.5.<br>
A suitable and preferred solvent is dipolar and aprotic.<br>
Examples of these are sulphones; dimethyl sulphoxide;<br>
esters, like methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or butyl<br>
acetate; ketones, like acetone or methylisobutylketone;<br>
ethers, like tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, methyl tert-butyl<br>
ether, diisopropyl ether; amides, like dimethyl acetamide,<br>
DMF and N-methylpyrrolidine, aromatics, like toluene;<br>
nitriles, like acetonitrile and carboxylic acids.<br><br>
The catalyst is preferably preformed in a separate reactor<br>
vessel from the desired cobalt precursor with carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen. Preferred amounts of the active<br>
catalyst are in the range of 0.1 mol% to 5 mol%, with<br>
respect to the reacting aldehyde, particularly preferred in<br>
the range of 1 to 2 mol%. A wide range of catalysts can be<br>
used, either as preformed carbonyls or formed in situ,<br>
including transition metal compounds of the following<br>
metals, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir or Pt. Preferred are<br>
compounds of Co, Pd, or Rh, especially preferred are<br>
compounds of cobalt. The presence of heteroatoms,<br>
especially sulphur, in the starting aldehyde does not<br>
negatively influence the yield of product, when cobalt is<br>
used as the metal in the catalyst.<br>
For step a), the amidocarbonylation reaction, the solution<br>
of the amide and the aldehyde is fed into a pressure<br>
resistant vessel and the vessel is pressurised with either<br>
carbon monoxide or synthesis gas, depending on the catalyst<br>
used. Carbon monoxide is preferably applied when catalysts<br>
based on palladium are used. In the case of catalysts based<br>
on other transition metals, synthesis gas is preferred.<br>
In the case of carbon monoxide, the preferred range of<br>
pressure is 20 to 130 bar (20,000 to 130,000 hPa) and in<br>
the case of synthesis gas the preferred range of pressures<br>
is 20 to 200 bar (20,000 to 200,000 hPa), especially<br>
preferred are 80 to 130 bar (80,000 to 130,000 hPa).<br>
Synthesis gas with H2/CO ratios of 1:1 to 1:9 can be used,<br>
whereby the. ratio of 1:8 to 1:9 is preferred. The pressure<br>
is maintained constant during the reaction.<br>
After pressurisation is completed, the vessel is heated to<br>
a temperature in the range of 40 °C to 150 °C, preferably<br>
between 60 °C and 120 °C, more preferred between 60 °C and<br>
80 °C.<br><br>
During the entire reaction period the reaction solution is<br>
agitated, preferably by means of stirring, enabling a<br>
maximal gas absorption into the solution.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the process of the<br>
present invention, a solution of the starting amide and the<br>
catalyst are added to an organic solvent in a pressure<br>
vessel. After pressurisation to the above mentioned<br>
pressure and heating to the above mentioned temperature,<br>
the aldehyde starting material is fed into the pressure<br>
vessel by means of a pump at a constant linear or more<br>
preferably non-linear rate during the reaction. In this way<br>
the selectivity of the reaction can be increased, and the<br>
amount of unwanted side products can be diminished.<br>
At the end of the reaction which takes between 20 minutes<br>
and 6 hours, or, if the process is run continuously, after<br>
an average residency time of the same, the reaction<br>
solution is cooled to 10 °C to 40 °C, preferably 20 °C to<br>
30 °C and depressurised to between 4 and 8 bar. The formed<br>
N-acyl amino acid precipitates from the solution and is<br>
removed by filtration.<br>
Residues of the active catalyst are then removed by washing<br>
the W-acyl amino acid filter cake under pressure of between<br>
4 to 6 bar with the solvent used for the reaction. These<br>
washings containing the residues of active catalyst are<br>
then recycled into the initial pressure vessel, thus<br>
avoiding the necessity for the destruction and regeneration<br>
of the active catalyst. One has to bear in mind that the<br>
active form of the catalyst is volatile and hence some<br>
quantity of catalyst might be lost during depressurisation.<br>
To avoid this effect, the gases released upon<br>
depressurisation are, after recompression, returned to the<br>
pressure reaction vessel. Catalyst dissolved in the<br>
reaction solution is recycled into the said vessel after<br>
the W-acyl amino acid is removed from the said reaction<br>
solution as described above. Some of this solution is<br><br>
discarded in order to prevent enrichment of the spent<br>
catalyst and has to be replaced by fresh solvent and fresh<br>
cobalt carbonyl catalyst. Experiments show an activity loss<br>
of not more than 10-15 %.<br>
After removal of the last traces of solvent by means of<br>
drying, the product N-acyl amino acid is transferred to a<br>
pressure vessel containing water. The concentration of the<br>
N-acyl amino acid in the water is in the range of 0.1 molar<br>
to 5 molar. The reaction solution is then heated to a<br>
temperature in the range of 120 °C to 180 °C, preferably to<br>
between 140 °C and 160 °C. Further details of such a<br>
process are known by the skilled person and are, for<br>
example, described in WO 02/14260.<br>
After a reaction time of between 4 and 6 hours, the aqueous<br>
solution is cooled to a temperature in the range of 10 °C<br>
to 40 °C where upon the product amino acid precipitates.<br>
After filtration and drying, the desired amino acid is<br>
obtained.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the filtrate<br>
containing the carboxylic acid formed during the<br>
hydrolysis, as well as trace amounts of the starting N-acyl<br>
amino acids, is mixed with an organic solvent immiscible<br>
with water in a counter flow extraction column. Preferred<br>
organic solvents are cyclohexanone, butanone, ethyl acetate<br>
and MIBK, particularly preferred is MIBK (methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone). The carboxylic acid is transferred into the<br>
organic layer and the aqueous solution containing<br>
impurities and the remaining starting material is returned<br>
to the hydrolysis reaction vessel. A part of the said<br>
solution is also discarded in the form of a purge, in order<br>
to prevent the build-up of unwanted side products. The<br>
organic solvent containing the carboxylic acid (in<br>
particular acetic acid) is then fed into a second counter<br>
flow extraction column, where an aqueous solution of<br>
ammonia is used as the counter flow. The reaction leads to<br><br>
the formation of an ammonium carboxylate in the aqueous<br>
phase which is subjected to a dehydration reaction to<br>
obtain a carboxylic acid amide. Details are known to the<br>
skilled person, or for example described in EP 919 539 A1.<br>
The organic solvent from the organic layer is separated and<br>
after drying recycled in the first extraction column.<br>
The single processes are preferably conducted as connected<br>
processes, which is an advantage during large scale<br>
production.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate the<br>
invention, without having a limiting effect.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
3.02 g acetamide, 5.36 g 3-(methylthio)propanal (97 %<br>
purity) and 0.342 g of Co2(CO)8, the cobalt catalyst<br>
precursor were dissolved in 50 ml butyl acetate in a 100 ml<br>
laboratory autoclave. The reactor was pressurised to 130<br>
bar (130,000 hPa) with 1:1 H2/CO synthesis gas and heated<br>
to 70 °C whilst stirring. The reaction was stirred for 8<br>
hours after which the reactor vessel was cooled to room<br>
temperature and the pressure released. Analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture using HPLC gave:<br>
MMP conversion 100 %<br>
Yield (N-acetyl methionine)	92.2 %<br>
Selectivity (N-acetyl methionine) 92.2 %<br>
Side products included approximately 5 %<br>
1,3-bis(methylthio)propane.<br>
The product N-acetyl methionine was recovered by filtration<br>
of the product solution. Washing the solid with chilled<br>
ethyl acetate and drying in vacuum gave N-acetyl methionine<br>
as a white solid.<br><br>
The filtrate and the wash fractions are recovered, spent<br>
catalyst amounts are supplemented and the whole is fed into<br>
step a) of the process.<br>
Example 2<br>
3.02 g of acetamide and 0.142 g of Co2(CO)8, the cobalt<br>
catalyst precursor, were dissolved in 2 0 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate in a 100 ml laboratory autoclave. The reactor was<br>
pressurised to 130 bar (130,000 hPa) with 1:1 H2/CO<br>
synthesis gas and heated to 80° C whilst stirring. After 5<br>
minutes a solution of 5.36 g MMP (97 %) in 25 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate was slowly added using an HPLC pump at a rate of<br>
0.42 ml/min up to 50 % addition, 0.21 ml/min up to 75 %<br>
addition, 0.13 ml/min up to 91 % addition and 0.08 ml/min<br>
up to 100 % addition. Subsequently, 5 ml of ethyl acetate<br>
were added to the reaction in order to rinse the pump and<br>
addition line. The reaction was continued for a further 2.5<br>
hours, after which the reactor vessel was cooled to room<br>
temperature and the pressure released. Analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture using HPLC gave:<br>
MMP conversion	96 %<br>
Yield (N-acetyl methionine)	89.9 %<br>
Selectivity (N-acetyl methionine) 93.6 %<br>
Side products included 
ester and approximately 4 % 1,3-bis(methylthio)propane.<br>
Example 3<br>
N-Acetyl methionine formed according to example 1 was<br>
hydrolysed to methionine and the acetic acid formed was<br>
reacted with ammonia to give acetamide.<br>
6.40 g of N-acetyl methionine were dissolved in 50.4 g of<br>
water. The solution was transferred to a 100 ml pressure<br>
vessel and heated to 165 °C whilst stirring for 5 hours,<br><br>
during which the pressure remained constant at about 9 bar<br>
(9,000 hPa).<br>
After cooling to room temperature, the solution was<br>
filtered and the recovered methionine was dried in vacuum.<br>
N-Acetyl methionine conversion 93 %<br>
Yield (methionine)	90 % (60 % isolated)<br>
Yield (acetic acid)	92 %<br>
The presence of the dipeptide Met-Met as well as the<br>
diketopiperazine formed from two methionine molecules were<br>
detected by HPLC (&gt; 0.5 % overall).<br>
The filtrate containing the acetic acid formed during the<br>
hydrolysis, as well as trace amounts of the starting N-acyl<br>
amino acids, is mixed with MIBK in a counter flow<br>
extraction column.<br>
The acetic acid is transferred into the organic layer and<br>
the aqueous solution containing impurities and the<br>
remaining unreacted starting material is returned to the<br>
hydrolysis reaction vessel. A part of the said solution is<br>
also discarded in the form of a purge, in order to prevent<br>
the build-up of unwanted side products. The organic layer<br>
containing the acetic acid is then fed into a second<br>
counter flow extraction column, where an aqueous solution<br>
of ammonia is used as the counter flow. The reaction leads<br>
to the formation of an ammonium carboxylate which is<br>
subjected to a dehydration reaction in order to obtain<br>
acetamide as described in EP 919 539 A1. The MIBK is then<br>
removed and after drying recycled in the first extractor<br>
column.<br><br>

TITLE: PROCESS FOR PREPARING AMINO ACIDS USING THE<br>
AMIDOCARBONYLATION REACTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing an amino acid<br>
comprising the following reaction steps: amidocarbonylation reaction,<br>
wherein an aldehyde is reacted in an organic solvent with an amide<br>
and carbon monoxide and hydrogen to give an N-acyl amino acid in<br>
the presence of a transition metal carbonyl catalyst, recovery of the<br>
formed N-acyl amino acid from the reaction mixture; and hydrolysis of<br>
the recovered N-acyl amino acid in an aqueous medium to obtain the<br>
corresponding amino acid and carboxylic acid; reuse of the reaction<br>
mixture of step comprising the catalyst and solvent after separation<br>
of the N-acyl amino acid by feeding into the amidocarbonylation step<br>
optionally after supplementing lost solvent and spent catalyst,<br>
characterized in that the amide used in step is regenerated such<br>
that after separation of the amino acid the carboxylic acid formed by<br>
hydrolysis is extracted and brought into contact with aqueous<br>
ammonia, formed ammonium carboxylate is separated, and said<br>
carboxylate is subjected to a dehydration reaction for obtaining<br>
carboxylic acid amide, and said carboxylic acid amide is fed to the<br>
amidocarbonylation process.</td>
