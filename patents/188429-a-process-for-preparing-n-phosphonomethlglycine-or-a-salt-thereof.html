N-phosphonomethylglycine, known also by its common name glyphosate, is a highly effective commercial herbicide (available under the trade name Roundup™) useful for the control of a large variety of weeds. When used in a hcrbicidal composition, N-phosphonomethylglycine is generally in the form of one of its various salts in solution, preferably an aqueous solution.<br>
Many methods for producing N-phosphonomethylglycine are known including several methods for producing N-phosphonomethylglycine from aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) or its salts. These methods include a process in which AMPA is added to an aqueous solution of glyoxal at 40° to 45°C and heated, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 61992/1987; a process in which AMPA and glyoxal are reacted in the presence of sulfur dioxide, as disclosed in European Patent No. 81,459 and U.S. Patent No. 4.369,142; a process in which AMPA and glyoxylic acid are reacted and reduced subsequently with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst, as described in European Patent No. 186,648; a process in which AMPA and chloroacetic acid are heated in the presence of an acid acceptor such as sodium hydioxide, as described in Polish Patent No. 120,759 and Spanish Patent No. 504,479; and a process in which AMPA and diethyl bromomalonate are reacted under alkaline conditions, and then hydrolyzed under acidic<br><br>
conditions using sulfuric acid, as described in Spanish Patent No. 545,456.  These processes,<br>
however, have deficiencies, including the use of volatile gases, creation of high levels of<br><br>
waste by-products, insufficient product yield, relatively high materials cost, and inadequate product quality.<br>
Other known processes for preparing N-phosphonomethylglycine from AMPA involve the hydrolysis of the intermediate material N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile or its salts. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,221,583, AMPA is reacted sequentially with formaldehyde, generally in the presence of alkali, and an alkali metal cyanide at pH 7 to 10. The resulting product, N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile, is then converted to N-phosphonomethylglycine. The yield of isolated N-phosphonomethylglycine, based on AMPA, was only about 60% and it was necessary to use up to 2.4 times the molar equivalent of potassium cyanide and to control the pH carefully to accomplish this yield.<br>
Similarly, in Polish Patent No. 156,933, the reaction of AMPA to prepare N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile is sequential and multi-step using formaldehyde and an alkali metal cyanide or hydrogen cyanide. Polish Patent No. 156,933 requires even more careful control of pH by adding mineral acid in order to obtain optimum yields.<br>
PCT/95/GB2573 is also directed to a reaction of AMPA to prepare N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile in a sequential, multi-step process using formaldehyde and an alkali metal cyanide. PCT/95/GB2573 avoids the use of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and also requires careful control of pH by continuously adding mineral acid to obtain optimum yields.<br><br>
U.S.   Patent   No.   5,453,537   further   discloses   a   process    for   preparing   N phosphonomethylglycine using AMPA as a starting compound. An AMPA. in the form of it dialkali     metal     salt,     and     glycolonitrile     are     reacted     and     the     resulting     N phosphonomethylglycinonitrile   is   hydrolyzed   to   produce   N-phosphonomethylglycine. According to the examples, the yield of isolated N-phosphonomethylglycine was at best 78% based on AMPA.   The nature of AMPA for this process requires the addition of an alkali metal hydroxide in an amount of 2 times the molar amount of AMPA for reaction to occur between glycolonitrile and AMPA.    Using glycolonitrile to produce the intermediate N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile in this process also precludes the direct cyanomethylation of AMPA by the use of more basic, more readily available, and less expensive raw materials such as formaldehyde and sodium, potassium or hydrogen cyanide.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the art for a versatile process which directly and readily converts AMPA to N-phosphonomethylglycine and its salts in high yields from inexpensive and available raw materials.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of N-phosphonomethylglycine and its salts. More particularly, this invention is directed to a method for preparing N-phosphonomethylglycine involving the reaction of AMPA, an alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide,, and formaldehyde and hydrolyzing the product of that reaction to form N-phosphonomethylglycine and its salts.<br><br>
The process according to the invention offers the significant advantage over other N-phosphonomethylglycine formation processes involving the cyanomethylation of AMPA in that it does not require rigorous attention to pH. In particular there is no need to add a mineral acid to the reaction solution of AMPA/alkali metal hydroxide /alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide /formaldehyde in order to control pH. The use of the alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde reactants in the inventive AMPA cyanomethylation process also allows the reaction to proceed without the use of a preformed glycolonitrile reactant as used in some other processes. Additionally, the inventive method is not limited to alkali metal cyanide reactants as it may use hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as the cyanide reactant.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention is broadly directed to a step of cyanomethylating AMPA in the production of N-phosphonomethylglycine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the inventive process is directed to a reaction of AMPA, about one equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide, about one equivalent of an alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide, and about one equivalent of formaldehyde; followed by the addition of about one equivalent of alkali metal hydroxide; and subsequent acidification of the mixture to crystallize the glyphosate product.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the process according to the invention involves a continuous process wherein AMPA and about one equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide (the mixture of which forms the mono-salt of AMPA), about one equivalent of hydrogen or<br><br>
alkali metal cyanide, and about one equivalent of formaldehyde are added to a reactor a about the same molar rate over a lime period, e.g., about 40 to 50 minutes, keeping th( temperature of the mixture low, e.g.. at about 5 °C or lower. The reaction solution is ther stirred, e.g., for about 30 minutes at about 3-5 °C, and then stirred at ambient temperature for a period of time, e.g., for about 1.5 hours. About one equivalent of alkali metal hydroxide is then added to the solution and heated, e.g., for about 2 hours. The solution is then cooled and acidified to a pH such that the glyphosate product crystallizes, e.g. at about pH 1.05, and the glyphosate product that crystallizes is removed by filtration or centrifugation.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the process according to the invention involves a batch process wherein a mono-salt of AMPA (which may be formed by a mixture of AMPA and an equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide) and an equivalent of an alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide are mixed in a reactor in an aqueous solution; to which an equivalent of formaldehyde solution is added over a period of time, keeping the temperature below about 25 °C, after which the solution is stirred at ambient temperature for some period of time, e.g., about 1-3 hours. About one equivalent of alkali metal hydroxide is subsequently added to the mixture and heated to reflux for a period of time, e.g., 1-3 hours. The solution is then cooled and acidified to a pH such that the glyphosate product crystallizes, e.g. at about pH 1.05, and the glyphosate product that crystallizes is removed by filtration or centrifugation.<br>
The "AMPA" reactant is generally aminomethylphosphonic acid or a salt thereof, also referred to as "an aminomethylphosphonate." For example the AMPA may be a mono- or di-alkali metal salt of aminomethylphosphonic acid. In a preferred embodiment, the AMPA reactant is the mono-alkali metal salt of AMPA, e.g., the monosodium- or monopotassium-<br><br>
salt of AMPA, which may be prepared by mixing aminomethylphosphonic acid with an equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide. For example, the mono-sodium salt of AMPA may be prepared by mixing AMPA and an equivalent of sodium hydroxide, by themselves or in the presence of other reactants, e.g. an alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide or formaldehyde.<br>
The cyanide reactant may be either an alkali metal cyanide, e.g., sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide, or hydrogen cyanide. The formaldehyde reactant may be added in the form of formalin, The AMPA/alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide/formaldehyde reactants are preferably added in a molar ratio of about 1:1:1. Where the AMPA component is a mixture of aminomethylphosphonic acid and an alkali metal hydroxide, the molar ratio of aminomethylphosphonic acid/alkali metal hydroxide/alkali metal or hydrogen cyanide/formaldehyde is about 1:1:1:1. In this context, the ratio of "about 1:1" preferably means a molar ratio of 0.75-1.25:1, more preferably a molar ratio of 0.85-1.15:1, and most preferably a molar ratio of 0.9 - 1.1:1.<br>
The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art. that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing N-phosphonomethylglycine or a salt thereof, said process comprising the steps of a) concurrently mixing at least two of the reactants selected from a aminomethylphosphonate, an alkali metal cyanide or hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde, subsequently adding any remaining reactant to obtain a reaction mixture having an N-cyanomethylaminophosphonate whereby substantially no PH control is required during the formation of said reaction mixture b) hydrolyzing the said reaction mixture; and c) isolating the hydrolyzed mixture in a known manner to obtain N-phosphonomethylglycine or a salt thereof.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
A 250 mL 3-neck flask containing 25 mL water was cooled in an ice bath an equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and two syringe pumps. One pump had two syringes. A solution of sodium cyanide (4.9 g; 0.1 mol) in 14 mL water was taken up into one while the other contained 37% ACS grade formalin (0.1 mol) in 14 mL water. A 60 mL syringe was mounted on the other pump. This syringe was used to add the AMPA as its monosodium salt prepared from AMPA (11.1 g; 0.1 mol) dissolved in 60 mL water with sodium hydroxide pellets (0.1 mol) at ambient temperature. With the monosodium salt of AMPA, the solution was gently warmed to maintain solubility.<br>
The syringe pumps were started simultaneously. The three reactants were thereby transferred into the flask at about the same molar rate over 40 to 50 minutes and each syringe rinsed with 2 mL water. The temperature during the addition was kept at 5°C or lower during most of the addition. The reaction solution was then stirred at 3° to 5°C for about 30 minutes and then at ambient temperature for about 1.5 hours.<br>
A 1.0 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was weighed to four decimal places and ■ diluted with water in a 10 mL volumetric flask. Phosphorus NMR of this diluted sample using the coaxial external standard of 5% H3PO4 was obtained. The chemical shifts of AMPA and N-cyanomethyl-AMPA (i.e., N-phosphonomethylglycinonitrile) were 19.1 and 16.2 ppm relative to phosphoric acid in the presence of 3.0 equivalents of NaOH. In this case, the bis-cyanomethylated AMPA derivative was assigned as a shoulder on the N-i'Samnwtnfl AMPA peak at 16.4 ppm.  With two equivalents of NaOH, the chemical shifts<br><br>
of N-cyanomethyl-AMPA and unreacted AMPA were observed at 14.9-15.0 and 15.9-16. ppm respectively. The NMR results indicated a yield of N-phosphonomethyl-glycinonitril of 94.6%.<br>
Sodium hydroxide pellets (100 mmol) were added to the solution. The resulting yellow solution was then heated at reflux for 2 hours with ammonia offgassing.<br>
After cooling to ambient temperature, a 1.0 mL aliquot of the hydrolysate was weighed to four decimal places and diluted with water in a 10 mL volumetric flask. The resulting solution was analyzed by the 31? NMR method. The chemical shifts of AMPA, glyphosate and GI in these hydrolysate samples were 18.7-18.9, 15.9-16.2 and 15.4-16.1 ppm relative to phosphoric acid, respectively.   The NMR results indicated a yield of 94.6%.<br>
The yellow hydrolysate was transferred to a tared 250 mL flask, weighed and concentrated in vacuo on a rotary evaporator at 50-65°C depending on the pressure. The concentrated hydrolysate was weighed, transferred back to the original flask and the weight adjusted to give a total amount of concentrated hydrolysate of approximately 65 grams by adding water. The concentrated hydrolysate was mechanically stirred, cooled in an ice bath and treated with three portions of 37%) HCl to give a pH of 1.05 in the acidified solution. After crystallization the slurry was stirred at ambient temperature overnight and the pH checked periodically with small amounts of concentrated 37% HCl or aqueous NaOH (40 or 50 wt%) added to adjust the pH to 1.05 ± 0.05. When the pH remained within this pH range for at least one hour, the crystallization was assumed to be complete.<br><br>
The slurry was suction filtered into a glass sintered funnel mounted on a tared 250 mL vacuum filter flask. The initial filtrate was re-used to rinse out the flask and ensure complete solid transfer. The filter cake was washed successively with 10 mL water and 10 mL methanol. The wet cake was dried in the vacuum oven at 45-55°C until the weight of cake was constant. The dried cake and filtrate were assayed for glyphosate using HPLC. The isolated yield of glyphosate was 85.3% with a purity of 98.8%.<br>
Example 2<br>
A 250 mL 3-neck flask was cooled in an ice bath and equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a syringe pump with two syringes. A solution of sodium cyanide (4.9 g; 0.1 mol) in 14 mL water was taken up into one while the other contained 37% ACS grade formalin (0.1 mol) in 14 mL water. The monosodium salt of AMPA (0.1 mol) in 60 mL water was charged to the 250 mL flask and the formaldehyde and sodium cyanide solutions were added simultaneously at a rate of 0.6 mL/min at 3-5°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 3-5°C and then at ambient temperature as summarized for Example 1.<br>
