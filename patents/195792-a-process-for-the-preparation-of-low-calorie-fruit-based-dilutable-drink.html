				<td>A process for the preparation of low calorie fruit based dilutable formulation has been developed using intense sweeteners (Sucralose, Aspartame and Acesulfame-K) for target consumers, viz. those suffering from diabetes and obesity. Lime based formulation contained sweeteners, Sucralose (475-500mg%) or a combination of Aspartame (310-340mg%) and Acesulfame-K (250-275mg%) in limejuice. Orange based formulation contained sweeteners, Sucralose (225-250mg%) or a combination of Aspartame (130-160mg%) and Acesulfame-K (130-160mg%) in orange juice. Permitted preservative, Potassium metabisulphite (0.070-0.075%) was used. Citric acid (2.5-3.2%) was added in case of orange-based formulation. The formulation had a shelf life of 3 months. The calorie reduction was 12 times in case of Orange formulation and 45 times in case of Lime formulation when compared to the conventional squash prepared with sugar. The dilution factor was also higher when compared to the conventional squash, which has 1:3 while the low calorie lime based formulation has 1:19 and orange based fumnulation has 1:9 (formulation: water).</td>

				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of low calorie fruit based dilutable formulation.<br>
Conventionally prepared fruit squashes contain 45-55% sugar and therefore certain class of people cannot drink it. Low caiorie soft drinks are essentially prepared to meet the needs of particular target groups namely diabetics, obese and calorie conscious populations. Many types of low calorie drinks based on artificial fruit flavours are available and extensive work has also been carried out.<br>
Conventionally fruit squashes are prepared using fruit juices (lime, orange, pineapple), sucrose, citric acid, flavouring materials, colour and preservatives. The method of preparation has been standardized by Lal Singh, Girdhari Lal and other co-workers who have given simple recipes for small-scale production. The preparation is as follows: sugar, citric acid and water are mixed together, heated, cooled and filtered through cloth. The clean syrup is mixed with juice. To improve flavour, essence is added. Colour is also added. After mixing all the ingredients, a chemical preservative like potassium metabisulphite, dissolved previously in small quantity of water or juice is added at the rate of an ounce for every 10G lb of squash (this correspouds to 350ppm of sulphur di oxide, which is permitted by law). The squash is then filled into washed and sterilized bottles, leaving about one inch of headspace. The bottles are closed with crown or ordinary corks and labeled. Then they are stored in a cool and dry place. (Girdhari Lai, G.S.Siddappa and G.L. Tandon, 1967, Preservation of fruits and vegetables, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi.)<br>
As per the FPO specifications, the minimum percent of total soluble solids in the final product (w/w) should be 40 and the minimum percent of fruit juice in the final product should be 25. In case of orange or lime squash, the recipe may have 25% juice, acidity of 1.5% and °Brix of 45 or 2% acidity and 65°B.<br>
There are a number of patents on the use of intense sweeteners in food products. Jager and Wiedmann (1998, German Federal Republic Patent; DEI9653354 CI) have described the use of oligosaccharides to increase the sweetness and improve the taste of aqueous solution of acesulfame-K and aspartame. Aspartame-sweetened, acidic, powdered beverage mix has been developed by Locus Ychang et al 1999 (United States Patent). Liquid shelf-stable freezable fruit juice containing composition and method of making the same have been developed by Kastin (1990, United-States Patent; US 4 925 686, US 128202 (19871202)). A carbonated, fruit juice<br>
beverage, flavoured with natural or nature-identical flavours, and sweetened with a mixture of mono or disaccharide sugars and aspartame has been described by Nakel and Heckert, 1987 (European-Patent). Aseptic addition of the dipeptide of L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid to pasteurized drinks and juices has been patented by Kryger (1985,PCT-International-Patent-Application). Sweetener composition containing sucralose and a saccharide sweetener selected from fructose, glucose, maltose and gluco-oligosaccharides and mixtures there of and sugar alcohols can be used in confectionery, bakery products, dietetic foods and beverages especially soft drinks [Beyts, 1989, UK Patent Application, GB 2210545 A, GB 8723423 (19871006)]. Shamil (1999, United States Patent; US 5902628) has described a method to reduce the lingering sweet aftertaste of sucralose in artificially sweetened beverages (particularly sucralose sweetened cola beverage) by using 1-tannic acid compound.<br>
Nahon et al, 1996 have studied the sweetness flavour interactions in soft drinks using intense sweeteners, saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame and acesulfame-K. Developments in the use of high intensity sweeteners in the European soft drinks industry, and in particular that in eastern Europe, have been discussed by Bergman (1996) along with factors that have the potential to shape the future of the low calorie soft drinks sector (e.g. use of aspartame in vitamin drinks, orange carbonates and powdered, fruit flavoured soft drinks). Sensory profiles of commercial fruit juice drinks and the influence of sweetener type either natural sugars (sucrose, glucose syrup or fructose) or artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame K) have been studied by Muir et al (1998). Zdziennicka and Jasinska (1995) have studied fruit products sweetened with aspartame. The stability of sugar substitutes, in particular aspartame, in low calorie and sugar-free beverages have been discussed by Matthews (1995). Houghton (1988) has discussed low-calorie soft drinks with intense sweeteners including alitame and sucralose.<br>
However, no information is available on the low calorie fruit based dilutable formulation containing alternative sweeteners. Hence, an attempt is made to develop low calorie firuit based dilutable formulation.<br>
Status of Sweeteners in India:<br>
As per the Central Committee of Food Standards, 2001, in India, aspartame and acesulfame-K are allowed as tabletop sweeteners and also in carbonated water and soft drink<br>
concentrates at levels of 700ppm for aspartame and 300ppm for acesulfame-K. Sucralose has not yet been approved for use in India.<br>
Status of Sweeteners in other countries:<br>
Aspartame: In addition to United States, aspartame has been approved for use in food and<br>
beverage and/or tabletop sweeteners in over 90 countries.<br>
Acesulfame-K: Almost 40 countries have approved the use of acesulfame-K in various products<br>
including UK, USA, Ireland, Switzerland and Cyprus.<br>
Sucralose: Petitions to receive regulatory approval of sucralose for use in a variety of food<br>
applications have been filed separately in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, The<br>
European  Economic   Community,   Denmark,   Australia  and  the  Joint  FAO/WHO   Expert<br>
Committee on food additives.<br>
