Process for the Preparation of Nitric Esters of Monohydric Alcohols<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of nitric esters of<br>
monohydric alcohols.<br>
The cetane number (shortly referred to as CN) is a characteristic analogous to the<br>
octane number for the ignition performance of a diesel fuel wherein the shorter the<br>
time between the moment the fuel enters the cylinder of the engine and the ignition<br>
(ignition delay), the higher the value of the cetane number (cf. Rompp<br>
Chemielexikon, 10th Edition, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart/New York, under<br>
headword: "Cetan-Zahl"). For many years already nitric esters of monohydric<br>
alcohols as e.g. amyl nitrate, hexyl nitrate, octyl nitrate and their isomers, as e.g. 2-<br>
ethylhexyl nitrate, have been used in the function of cetane number improvers for<br>
diesel fuels.<br>
Though the mononitrates of these alcohols themselves are not listed as explosives<br>
and though they are quite stable, their preparation involves some risks. Sometimes<br>
the spent acids from the nitration are not stable and may decompose in an<br>
uncontrolled way. Apart from that, during nitration vigorous oxidative<br>
decompositions of the product, combined with a so called fume-off, or even an<br>
explosion may occur (cf. e.g. Health Hazard Evaluation Report No. HETA 82-285-<br>
1339, in Chem. Abstracts 102, 190181 (1985)).<br>
Therefore, various efforts have been made to minimize or eliminate these risks.<br>
For instance, US-A-2,768,964 discloses a continuous and isothermal esterification of<br>
monohydric alcohols with mixed acids (from sulfuric acid and nitric acid) with a<br>
water content of 30 to 50 % in the presence of urea (1 to 10 %) at temperatures of 65<br>
to 110 °C in vacuum. The resulting nitric esters are removed from the reaction<br>
mixture by distillation. This method shall prevent an uncontrolled oxidative<br>
decomposition of the product caused by the omnipresent nitrose oxides in the<br>
reaction mixture.<br><br>
But this method is rather laborious and with long-chain alcohols such as 1-octanol it<br>
produces yields of no more than 52 %. Moreover, the high water content in the<br>
nitrating acids brings about instable acids.<br>
If the esterification is carried out in a stirred tank reactor or a stirred tank reactor<br>
cascade in a continuous way under isothermal conditions and without using urea, it<br>
is common in the state of the art to work with mixed acids from nitric acid and<br>
sulfuric acid having a water content of 0 to 14 % and at temperatures as low as<br>
possible, i.e. between - 15 °C and maximally 20 °C, preferably below 10 °C, in the<br>
presence of an excess of ca. 5 % nitric acid, related to the alcohol to be nitrated, (cf.<br>
US patents Nos. 2,618,650, 2,734,910 and 4,479,905).<br>
In doing so, the weight ratio of water to sulfuric acid in the final spent acid should<br>
not exceed 0.35 in order to prevent the risk of a "fume-off (cf. US-A-2,734,910).<br>
Apart from that, the residence times of the reaction mixture in the reactors should be<br>
as short as possible, particularly between 0.6 and 15 minutes, preferably between 3<br>
and 6 minutes, to prevent an accumulation of side products resulting from oxidative<br>
side reactions.<br>
In the state of the art only a combination of the parameters mentioned above, i.e. low<br>
temperatures during nitration, short residence times of the reaction mixture in the<br>
reactors and a final spent acid with a weight ratio of water to sulfuric acid below<br>
0.35, allows a comparatively secure, continuous isothermal esterification of primary<br>
and secondary alcohols with nitric acid.<br>
These methods, as well, are laborious and require a high degree of monitoring.<br>
The purpose of this invention is to provide a method for the preparation of nitric<br>
esters of monohydric alcohols which eliminates the above mentioned disadvantages<br>
or problems prevailing within the state of the art.<br><br>
Surprisingly it was discovered that the problem described above can be solved if the<br>
process is carried out in such a way that the monohydric alcohols are continuously<br>
and under adiabatic reaction conditions converted with a mixed acid (a mixture of<br>
nitric and sulfuric acid).<br>
Hence, the present invention suggests a method according to claim 1. Other<br>
advantageous embodiments are subject of the respective dependent claims.<br>
Thus, subject-matter of the present invention is a process for the preparation of esters<br>
of nitric acid (nitric esters) of monohydric alcohols wherein a monohydric alcohol or<br>
a mixture of monohydric alcohols is converted with nitric acid under adiabatic<br>
reaction conditions in the presence of sulfuric acid. (Apart from nitric acid and<br>
sulfuric acid the esterification reagent generally also contains water, usually in<br>
varying quantities. This means that usually an aqueous mixture of nitric acid and<br>
sulfuric acid is used as esterification reagent.) Usually, the process according to the<br>
invention is carried out continuously. Generally spoken, a discontinuous, i.e.<br>
batchwise processing is possible as well, though the continuous process is preferred.<br>
Contrary to the processes in the state of the art, according to the invention the<br>
conversion is performed not isothermally, but adiabatically, i.e. without any heat<br>
exchange with the environment. This means that the reaction can take place at<br>
comparatively high temperatures between 10 and 80 °C.<br>
In the context of the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that the<br>
esterification of monohydric alcohols, as for example amyl alcohol, hexanol,<br>
heptanol, octanol, etc. and their isomers with a mixed sulfuric and nitric acid is<br>
possible in a continuous way not only - as proposed in the state of the art -<br>
isothermally at low temperatures, but can, according to this invention, also be safely<br>
carried out adiabatically, particularly within a temperature range between 10 and 80<br>
°C, preferably between 10 and 70 °C, more preferably between 20 and 60 °C,<br>
wherein the reaction is preferably performed in a tubular reactor.<br>
Adiabatic reactions with mixed acids from nitric acid and sulfuric acid are generally<br>
known in connection with nitro aromatics and are used for example for the<br>
preparation of nitrobenzene (cf. US patents Nos. 4,021,498 and 4,091,042). But up to<br>
now adiabatic reactions have, within the state of the art, not been considered for the<br>
preparation of nitric esters.<br>
Especially surprising is the fact that the conversion of the monohydric alcohol or<br>
alcohols takes place with a mixed acid from nitric acid and sulfuric acid only, i.e. no<br>
additional reagents, especially no urea, are necessary.<br>
Within the present invention preferably primary monohydric alcohols are used. But<br>
in principle the conversion of secondary and tertiary monohydric alcohols is<br>
possible, as well. According to the present invention as monohydric alcohols,<br>
preferably as primary monohydric alcohols, C4- to C12- alcohols are used, preferably<br><br>
C5- to C8- alcohols preferably belonging to the group of amyl alcohols, hexanols,<br>
heptanols, octanols and isomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
As described above, the reaction, i.e. esterification is carried out specifically within a<br>
temperature range between 10 and 80 °C, preferably between 10 and 70 °C, more<br>
preferably within the range of 20 to 60 °C.<br>
It is advantageous according to the invention to perform the reaction in a reactor.<br>
The entire residence time in the reactor lasts in particular between 0.01 and 30<br>
seconds, preferably between 0.1 and 20 seconds, most preferably between 0.1 and 10<br>
seconds. A tubular reactor has proved especially suitable for the reaction. Such a<br>
tubular reactor should include at least one mixing device and at least one volume for<br>
residence time, specifically a residence time tube, while in the tubular reactor,<br>
particularly in the residence time tube, additional mixing elements may be arranged.<br>
In order to guarantee an efficient course of the process, during the reaction, i.e.<br>
during the esterification, a mixing energy of 10 to 1000 J/1 (joule/liter), preferably 10<br>
to 300 J/1, more preferably 10 to 100 J/1, should be introduced into the reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
The mixture of final spent acid and product resulting after the reaction is generally<br>
subject to a phase separation. In doing so it is advantageous to cool the mixture of<br>
final spent acid and product down to temperatures between 10 and 30 °C, preferably<br>
between 15 and 20 °C, after it leaves the reactor and before phase separation takes<br>
place.<br>
To ensure an efficient course of reaction, the ratio of nitric acid and sulfuric acid in<br>
the starting mixed acid should be chosen in such a way that the weight ratio of<br>
sulfuric acid to water in the final spent acid (i.e. in the acid obtained after completion<br>
of the reaction) is at least 2:1; more specifically it should be in the range between 2:1<br>
and 5:1, preferably between 3:1 and 4.5:1.<br>
Further, to ensure an efficient course of reaction, the ratio of nitric acid to sulfuric<br>
acid in the starting mixed acid should be chosen in such a way that the final spent<br>
acid resulting after the reaction has a residual content of at least 0.5 weight<br>
percentages (wt. %) nitric acid, preferably at least 1 wt. %, more preferably between<br>
1 and 4 wt. % nitric acid. In other words this means that with regard to the alcohols<br>
underlying esterification the process is carried out with a stoichiometric excess of<br>
nitric acid.<br>
Generally, as starting mixed acid a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid can be<br>
used that contains varying amounts of water, particularly a mixture on the basis of a<br>
50 to 99 % nitric acid, preferably a 65 to 99 % nitric acid, together with a 80 to 99 %<br>
sulfuric acid, more preferably a 85 to 96 % sulfuric acid, and, if necessary with a<br>
certain amount of recycled final spent acid (while the recycled final spent acid may<br>
particularly have the above mentioned composition).<br><br>
Part of the final spent acid can be recycled for the preparation of the starting mixed<br>
acid. But alternatively it is not obligatory to use final spent acid for the preparation<br>
of the starting mixed acid.<br>
According to the invention the monohydric alcohols underlying esterification are, for<br>
the purpose to react, fed together with the starting mixed acid, into a mixing zone<br>
and subsequently into a tubular reaction zone, in which the reaction is completed. If<br>
necessary, additional mixing elements may be arranged in the reaction tube in such a<br>
way that the esterification is possible in an optimal way over the whole distance of<br>
the reaction tube.<br>
If too little mixing energy is put into the reaction mixture which results in a non-<br>
optimal distribution of the sparingly soluble organic phase in the acid phase, the<br>
conversion of the alcohol to be esterified will be incomplete after the scheduled<br>
residence time and, apart from that, there is a risk that reactive side products may<br>
form by oxidative side reactions of the alcohol with the excess nitric acid in the<br>
reaction mixture, with the risk of a runaway reaction ("fume-off).<br>
The reaction partners starting mixed acid and monohydric alcohol (to be esterified)<br>
may be fed into the reactor in the defined weight ratio for instance by a dosing pump<br>
system with especially low pulsation and in such a way that the necessary mixing<br>
energy can be introduced.<br>
The process according to this invention achieves a turnover (total yield) of the<br>
alcohol to be esterified to nitric ester of more than 99 %, preferably at least 99.5 %.<br>
Other advantages of the process are a minimized reactor volume and, in connection<br>
with this, a minimization of the so called "hold-up" in the reactor allowing short<br>
start-up times and the possibility to start or interrupt the process within seconds in<br>
case of irregularities during the reaction.<br>
Owing to this (short reaction times) and in connection with a quick and effective<br>
phase separation, an accumulation of side products in the product and in the final<br>
spent acid is reduced to a minimum.<br>
The reactor having at least one mixing zone and at least one reaction zone - these<br>
zones may, in particular cases, be identical - is usually not cooled. Consequently,<br>
due to the released heat of reaction and the heat of dilution of the mixed acid, the<br>
temperature in the reaction mixture rises from the temperature of the mixed acid and<br>
the alcohol to be esterified to the defined end temperature. In this process the whole<br>
heat of mixing and reaction will be retained in the reaction mixture which serves as<br>
"energy store".<br>
The end temperature in the reaction mixture results out of the initial temperature of<br>
the reaction partners mixed acid and alcohol and the ratio mixed acid/alcohol and<br>
can therefore be exactly adjusted to the properties of the alcohol to be esterified.<br><br>
Compared with an esterification of the monohydric alcohol performed isothermally<br>
and in a continuous mode of operation, e.g. in a stirred tank reactor, the process<br>
according to the invention allows, due to the adiabatic reaction with a resulting rise<br>
in temperature by 20 to 50 °C, for example in a tubular reactor, an acceleration of the<br>
conversion of the residual amounts of still unconverted alcohol in the reaction<br>
mixture. On the other hand the residence time of the esterification mixture from<br>
mixing acid and alcohol in the reactor can be substantially reduced. According to the<br>
invention the residence times generally amount to, depending on the alcohol to be<br>
esterified and the mixing device applied, 0.01 to 30 seconds, more preferably 0.1 to<br>
20 seconds, most preferably 0.1 to 10 seconds.<br>
In the mixing zone, especially if such alcohols are to be esterified that have only a<br>
low solubility in the nitrating acid, the alcohol to be esterified is distributed in the<br>
nitrating acid in a way allowing an optimized esterification of the alcohol to be<br>
converted.<br>
The required mixing of the reaction partners can be carried out either by means of<br>
passive mixing elements or by other means to introduce mixing energy into the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
As mixing elements for example Y-mixers, static mixers, orifice mixers, etc. can be<br>
used. The overall mixing energy put into the reaction mixture should be in the range<br>
of 10 to 1000 J/1 (joule/liter), more preferably 10 to 200 J/1, most preferably 10 to<br>
100 J/1.<br>
After completion of the reaction the nitric ester is separated from the final spent acid.<br>
For this purpose the nitrating mixture should be cooled down before phase<br>
separation to such a temperature that the solubility of the nitric ester in the final<br>
spent acid is reduced to such an extent that a secure storage of the final spent acid is<br>
possible without the risk of a postseparation in the acid store caused by cooling<br>
down the spent acid. This can be achieved for example by arranging directly after the<br>
reactor consisting of mixer and tubular reaction zone an additional cooling zone in<br>
which the nitrating mixture is cooled down to 10 to 30 °C, more preferably 15 to 20<br>
°C.<br><br>
The separated and cooled down final spent acid can be recycled together with the<br>
fresh mixed acid into the process in order to set the required weight ratio between<br>
nitrating acid and alcohol to be esterified in such a way that the chosen end<br>
temperature of the adiabatic conversion is not exceeded. In other words, the amount<br>
of recycled final spent acid can be chosen in such a way that the required end<br>
temperature is achieved.<br>
The concentration of nitric and sulfuric acid in the nitrating acid at the end of the<br>
reaction is chosen in such a way that the solubility of the esterified alcohol in this<br>
acid is minimized, as well as the risk of an oxidative decomposition of the side<br>
products dissolved in the final spent acid is kept as low as possible.<br>
For example, a nitrating acid from recycled final spent acid, concentrated sulfuric<br>
acid and nitric acid and/or mixtures thereof ("mixed acids") can be used which after<br>
the esterification reaction of the monohydric alcohol (i.e. in the final spent acid) has<br>
a weight ratio of sulfuric acid to water of at least 2:1, particularly in the range from<br>
2:1 to 5:1, more preferably in the range from 3:1 to 4.5:1, and has after the reaction<br>
(i.e. in the final spent acid) a nitric acid concentration of at least 0.5 % (wt. %), more<br>
preferably at least 1 %, most preferably in the range of 1 to 4 %.<br>
Apart from the recycled final spent acid, any other acid (nitric, sulfuric and mixed<br>
acid) can be used to prepare the nitrating acid used for the esterification of<br>
monohydric alcohols, provided the required composition of the final spent acid after<br>
completion of the reaction can be achieved. For example by adding 96 % sulfuric<br>
acid mixed with 65 % nitric acid or 96 % sulfuric acid mixed with 99 % nitric acid<br>
or 85 % sulfuric acid mixed with 98 % nitric acid or mixtures thereof ("mixed<br>
acids") to the final spent acid a nitrating acid can be produced out of which the final<br>
spent acid is obtained after completion of esterification.<br>
The sulfuric and nitric acids used for preparing a mixed acid and a nitrating acid are<br>
not restricted to the concentrations mentioned above. Apart from that, it is possible<br>
to dispense with the recirculation of final spent acid as long as the amount of mixed<br>
acid used allows absorbing the whole amount of heat evolved during the<br>
esterification and dilution of this mixed acid in such a way that the defined end<br>
temperature at the end of the adiabatic reaction is not exceeded.<br>
The phase separation of the reaction mixture resulting in product and acid phase may<br>
be performed either in static or dynamic separators. The use of dynamic separators<br>
(centrifugal separators) is preferred, though, in order to minimize the contact time of<br>
the final spent acid with the product and, consequently, the risk that decomposition<br>
products from oxidative side reactions with nitric acid may accumulate in the acid<br>
and/or the organic phase.<br>
The nitric ester separated from the final spent acid is washed - as usual - in three<br>
stages, at first with water, subsequently with an alkali solution and after that with<br>
water again. The washing water from the third washing stage is advantageously used<br>
in the first washing stage in order to remove the excess acid.<br><br>
The separation of the washing emulsion after each washing stage may be performed<br>
either in a static separator or with the help of dynamic separators (centrifugal<br>
separators).<br>
At least part of the separated final spent acid may be circulated. The final spent acid<br>
or - in case of recirculation - the excess of final spent acid may be reconcentrated in<br>
an SAC plant (SAC = sulphuric acid concentration) in such a way that it may be fed<br>
back into the process.<br>
The nitric ester that can be prepared in the process according to the invention may be<br>
any nitric ester obtained from any monohydric alcohols, but preferably it is a nitric<br>
ester of primary monohydric alcohols which are liquid at a temperature of 0 °C and<br>
lead to liquid nitric esters.<br>
Furthermore, the process is not restricted to monohydric alcohols that can be mixed<br>
with the nitrating acid or have a still good solubility in the nitrating acid, but is<br>
especially applicable for alcohols with poor miscibility and poor solubility in the<br>
nitrating acid and final acid, as e.g. 2-ethyl hexan-1-ol, on the example of which the<br>
advantage of the described process shall be demonstrated, excluding by doing so any<br>
restrictions.<br><br>
Other embodiments, amendments or variations as well as advantages of the present<br>
invention can be easily recognized and realized by the expert taking notice of the<br>
disclosed invention, without leaving the limits of the present invention.<br>
The following examples to practice the invention are given to illustrate the present<br>
invention, but are not intended to restrict its scope.<br>
EXAMPLES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Example No. 1: Nitration with Mixed Acid without Recirculation of Final<br>
Spent Acid<br>
1.563 kg/h of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 4.567 kg/h mixed acid with 69.2 % sulfuric<br>
acid, 18.2 % nitric acid and 12.6 % water and prepared out of 85 % sulfuric acid and<br>
98	% nitric acid were fed by means of a pump system with low pulsation via a T-<br>
tube into the reactor comprised of a static mixer and a reaction zone.<br>
Both feed streams have been tempered to 20 °C. The overall residence time in the<br>
reactor was 4.0 seconds. The specific energy input was approximately 64 J/1. At the<br>
end of the reactor a temperature of 51.5 °C has been reached. The adiabatic<br>
temperature rise amounted to 31.5 °C. Directly after the reactor the reaction mixture<br>
was cooled down to 20 °C. After phase separation approximately 2,090 g of the<br>
nitric ester of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were obtained (total yield of the raw product approx.<br>
99	%). The composition of the final spent acid (approx. 4.0 kg/h) was: 78.45 %<br>
sulfuric acid, 1.85 % nitric acid and 19.7 % water. The ratio sulfuric acid to water<br>
amounted to 3.98:1. After the usual 3-stage washing with water, alkali and water<br>
again a product was obtained containing 99.6 % of the nitric ester of 2-ethyl-1-<br>
hexanol and 0.31 % impurities, mainly 2-ethyl-1-hexanol.<br>
Example No. 2: Nitration with Mixed Acid and Recirculation of Final Spent<br>
Acid<br>
Approximately 0.73 kg mixed acid of the composition 54.5 % sulfuric acid, 43.5 %<br>
nitric acid and 2.0 % water, prepared out of sulfuric acid (97.2 %) and nitric acid (99<br>
%) were continuously mixed with about 2.01 kg/h final spent acid using a low<br>
pulsation pump system resulting in a nitrating acid with the composition 71.5 %<br>
sulfuric acid. 13.3 % nitric acid and 15.2 % water. Via a T-tube this nitrating acid,<br>
together with 630 g/h 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were fed into the reactor comprised of a<br>
static mixer and a reaction zone.<br>
The nitrating acid as well as the 2-ethyl-1-hexanol had been cooled down to 20 °C<br>
before being mixed. The overall residence time in the reactor amounted to 8.0<br>
seconds. The specific energy input amounted to approx. 36 J/1. At the end of the<br>
reactor a temperature of 45.2 °C has been reached. The adiabatic temperature rise<br>
amounted to 25.2 °C. Directly after the reactor the reaction mixture passed a cooling<br>
bath and was cooled down to 20 °C. After phase separation ca. 840 g of the nitric<br>
ester of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were obtained (total yield of raw product ca. 99 %). The<br><br>
composition of the final spent acid (ca. 2.7 kg/h) was: 77.6 % sulfuric acid, 2.4 %<br>
nitric acid and 20.0 % water. The ratio sulfuric acid to water was 3.8:1. After the<br>
usual 3-stage washing with water, alkali and water a product was obtained that had a<br>
content of 99.5 % of the nitric ester of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and containing 0.4 %<br>
impurities, mainly 2-ethyl-1-hexanol.<br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of nitric esters of monohydric alcohols,<br>
wherein a monohydric alcohol or a mixture of monohydric alcohols is<br>
reacted with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid under adiabatic<br>
reaction conditions, wherein the reaction is carried out continuously in<br>
a tubular reactor.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the monohydric alcohol is<br>
selected from primary monohydric alcohols.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction takes place<br>
within a temperature range of 10 to 80°C.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction is carried out in<br>
a tubular reactor and wherein the time of reaction is from 0.01 to 30<br>
seconds.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the overall mixing energy<br>
put into the reaction mixture amounts from 10 to 1000 J/1 (Joule/liter).<br>
6.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction mixture at the<br>
end of reaction is submitted to phase separation.<br><br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the mixing ratio of nitric<br>
acid to sulfuric acid in the starting mixed acid and the concentrations<br>
of the used acids in the nitrating acid is such that the weight ratio of<br>
sulfuric acid to water in the final spent acid is at least 2:1 and lies<br>
within the range of from 2:1 to 5:1.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the mixing ratio of nitric<br>
acid to sulfuric acid in the starting mixed acid is such that the final<br>
spent acid resulting after reaction has a residual content of at least 0.5<br>
wt % of nitric acid.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of nitric esters of<br>
monohydric alcohols, wherein a monohydric alcohol or a mixture of<br>
monohydric alcohols is reacted with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric<br>
acid under adiabatic reaction conditions, wherein the reaction is carried out<br>
continuously in a tubular reactor.<br></td>
