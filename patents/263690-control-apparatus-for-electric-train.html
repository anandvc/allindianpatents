CONTROL APPARATUS FOR ELECTRIC TRAIN<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
This invention relates to a control apparatus for an electric train, wherein an AC electric motor is used as a drive source, and the AC electric motor is controlled by a variable-voltage variable-frequency inverter.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
In case of an electric train, during ordinary'braking, electrical braking based on regenerative braking is performed to convert the inertial energy of a vehicle into electric energy, and to restore the regenerative energy to an overhead line, that is, a DC power feed line. In the regenerative braking, it is indispensable that the side of the DC power feed line has a regenerativity, or that another electric train under power running as acts as a regenerative load exists on the DC power feed line side. [0003]<br>
Here, in a case where the regenerative energy of the electric train in the regenerative braking state is greater<br><br>
than power which is consumed by the electric train in the power running state, the voltage of the overhead line or the voltage of a filter capacitor disposed at a stage preceding an inverter increases to an overvoltage, and a protective function is sometimes actuated. As means for improving this problem, it is common practice that the regenerative power from the electric train in the regenerative braking state is fined to lower a braking force based on the regenerative braking, and that the lowered component of the braking force is compensated by mechanical braking. In this case, however, a brake shoe wears off due to the mechanical braking, and hence, the maintenance of the brake shoe needs to be performed in a certain fixed period. [0004]<br>
in order to avoid the wear of the brake shoe, it has been known that a brake chopper which consists of a switching element and a resistor is disposed on the DC side of the inverter. In this case, when the regenerative power based on the electrical braking is great to raise the DC output voltage of the inverter, the brake chopper is operated to consume the regenerative power. Since, however, the brake chopper is added to a control apparatus in this case, there has been the problem that the control apparatus becomes large in size and high in fabrication cost. [0005]<br><br>
In Fig. 1 of JP2003-199204A (Patent Document 1), it is disclosed that an electric-double-layer capacitor which can store regenerative energy is employed instead of the brake chopper. In this patent document 1, in a control apparatus for an electric train, wherein a smoothing capacitor is disposed in a DC power feed circuit which is connected to a DC power feed line through a collector shoe and wherein a DC voltage smoothed by the smoothing capacitor is fed to a variable-voltage variable-frequency inverter, the electric-double-layer capacitor is connected in parallel with the smoothing capacitor through a DC/DC converter having a switching element, and in a regenerative braking state, regenerative energy from the inverter is stored in the electric-double-layer capacitor, whereas in a power running state or a coasting running state, the energy stored in the electric-double-layer capacitor is fed to the power feed line or the inverter. [0006]'<br>
Also, in Fig. 10 of JP2004-104976A (Patent Document 2), it is disclosed that an electric-double-layer capacitor is employed instead of a brake chopper circuit for the purpose of storing regenerative energy. [0007]<br>
Patent Document 1; JP20Q3-199204A {Claim 1, Fig. 1) Patent Document 2: JP2004-104976A (Sector 0072, Fig. 10)<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention is to Solve<br>
[0008]<br>
As stated above, in the prior-art control apparatus for an electric train, for the purpose of avoiding the wear of a brake shoe and effectively utilizing regenerative energy, it has been known to mount a brake chopper or to employ an electric-double-layer capacitor capable of storing the regenerative energy. However, it has been necessary to add the brake chopper or the electric-double-layer capacitor, and there has been the drawback that the control apparatus-becomes large in size and high in fabrication cost. [0009]<br>
This invention has been made in order to solve the above problem, and it has for its object to propose an improved control apparatus for an electric train as can consume surplus regenerative energy by utilizing the load of an auxiliary power source device, without adding the brake chopper or the electric-double-layer capacitor.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br><br>
[0014]<br>
Now, several embodiments of a control apparatus for an electric train according to this invention will be described with reference to the drawings. [0015] Embodiment 1:<br>
Pig. 1 is a block diagram showing Embodiment 1 of a control apparatus for an electric train according to this invention. The control apparatus 10 for the electric train in Embodiment 1 is the control apparatus installed in the electric train 1. The electric train 1 includes a wheel 2, and a collector shoe 3. The wheel 2 runs on a track 4, and the collector shoe 3 touches an overhead line, that is, a DC power feed line 5 and receives the feed of DC electric power from the DC power feed line 5. The DC power feed line 5 feeds DC electric power to a plurality of electric trains including the electric train<br>
I.	The prescribed voltage VD0 of the DC power feed line 5 is<br>
set at, for example, 1500 (V) or 750 (V).<br>
[0016]<br>
The control apparatus 10 includes an AC electric motor<br>
II,	an inverter 12, a DC power feed circuit 15, an AC power<br>
feed circuit 18, an auxiliary power source device 22, a load<br>
25, and load control means 30.<br>
[0017]<br>
The AC electric motor 11 is the drive source of the<br><br>
electric train 1, and it drives the wheel 2. This AC electric motor 11 is an AC induction motor of, for example, three phases. The inverter 12 is a variable-voltage variable-frequency inverter {WVF inverter), and it is configured by employing, for example, a thyristor. This inverter 12 has a pair of DC side terminals 13, and three-phase AC side terminals 14. The DC side terminals 13 are connected to the DC power feed circuit 15. The DC voltage of the DC power feed circuit 15 is let be "VD". The AC side terminals 14 are connected to the AC electric motor 11 through the AC power feed circuit 18. The AC power feed circuit 18 is a three-phase AC power feed circuit. The three-phase AC voltage of the AC power feed circuit 18 is let be "VAC". [0018]<br>
The DC power feed circuit 15 includes a reactor 16 and a smoothing capacitor 17, and it connects the DC side terminals 13 of the inverter 12 with the collector shoe 3 and the wheel 2. One end of the reactor 16 is connected to the collector shoe 3, while the other end thereof is connected to the plus side terminal of the DC side terminals 13 of the inverter 12. The minus side terminal of the DC side terminals 13 is directly connected to the wheel 2, and it is earthed through the wheel 2 as well as the track 4. One end of the smoothing capacitor 17 is connected between the reactor 16 and the plus side terminal of the DC side terminals 13, while the other end<br><br>
thereof is connected to the minus side terminal of the DC side terminals 13. The smoothing capacitor 17 is connected across the pair of DC side terminals 13 and in parallel therewith. [0019]<br>
A power running command FD and a regenerative braking command FB are given from the driver's stand of the electric train 1 to the inverter 12. The power running command FD and the regenerative braking command FB are given to the inverter 12 in the travel state of the electric train. The power running command FD is given in a state where the electric train 1 is brought into power running, when the power running command FD is given, the inverter 12 performs the conversion operation of converting the DC electric power from the DC power feed circuit 15, into three-phase AC electric power, and it generates converted output voltages on the basis of the conversion operation. The AC voltage value and frequency of the three-phase AC voltage VAC to be outputted from the inverter 12 are controlled in accordance with the command contents of the power running command FD. The three-phase AC electric power outputted from the inverter 12 is fed to the AC electric motor 11 through the AC power feed circuit 18 so as to drive this AC electric motor 11. [0020]<br>
The regenerative braking command FB is given in a state where the electric train 1 is to be regeneratively braked during<br><br>
the travel of the electric train 1. When the regenerative braking command FB is given, the inverter 12 receives the feed of three-phase AC electric power generated by the AC electric motor 11, from the AC power feed circuit 18, it performs the conversion operation of converting the three-phase AC electric power into DC electric power, and it generates a converted output voltage on the basis of the conversion operation. The DC electric power outputted from the inverter 12 is fed from the inverter 12 to the DC power feed circuit 15. [0021]<br>
The inverter 12 falls into an inverter stop state SC when it receives neither of the power running command FD and the regenerative braking command FB. Even in the travel state, when the electric train 1 falls into a coasting travel state, the inverter 12 falls into the inverter stop state SC . Besides, when the electric train 1 stops temporarily, the inverter 12 falls into the inverter stop state SC. In the inverter stop state SC, the inverter 12 stops the conversion operation between the DC electric power and the AC electric power, and hence, the converted output voltage is not generated, in this inverter stop state SC, DC electric power is fed from the DC power feed circuit 15 to the DC side terminals 13 of the inverter 12, but the DC electric power is not converted into three-phase AC electric power. Besides, in the inverter stop state SC, even when the AC electric motor 11 generates three-phase AC<br><br>
electric power, the three-phase AC electric power is not<br>
converted into DC electric power.<br>
[0022]<br>
The auxiliary power source device 22 is, for example, a constant-voltage constant-frequency inverter, and it has a pair of DC side terminals 23 and a pair of single-phase AC side terminals 24. The DC side terminals 23 of the auxiliary power source device 22 are connected to the DC power feed circuit 15/ while the AC side terminals 24 thereof are connected to the load 25. [0023]<br>
The load 25 is the AC electric equipment of the electric train 1, and it includes, at least, the in-room heater 2 6 and in-room aoelor 27 of the electric train 1. By way of example,<br>
the in-room heater 26 is arranged under a seat within the car<br>
air cond^c^e* room of the electric train 1, and the in-room oasler 2 7 is<br>
arranged at a ceiling within the car room of the electric train<br>
1. The in-room heater 26 and in-room OOOIOE 27 receives the<br>
feed of a single-phase AC voltage from the AC side terminals<br>
24 of the auxiliary power source device 22, and they are turned<br>
ON/OFF by the control of the load control means 30.<br>
Incidentally, although not shown, the in-room illumination<br>
lamp of the electric train 1 is also included in the load 25.<br>
The illumination lamp is connected so as to normally receive<br>
the feed of the single-phase AC voltage from the auxiliary power<br><br>
source device 22, without resorting to the load control means 30. Also the illumination lamp, however, can be turned ON/OFF by the load control means 30, together with the in-room heater 26 and in-room oeoler 27. [0024]<br>
The load control means 30 is configured of, for example, a microcomputer, and it has a CPU and a memory. The load control means 30 in Embodiment 1 receives an inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB from the inverter 12, and it ON/OFF-controls the in-room heater 26 and in-room «oolea: 27 on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. in Embodiment 1, the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB represents the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, and it becomes a high level signal in the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12. [0025]<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the details of the load control means 3 0 in Embodiment 1. The load control means 3 0 has a voltage generation table 31. This load control means 30 receives the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, and it generates load start signals LDSl and LDS2 by utilizing the voltage generation table 31. The load start signal LDSl is<br><br>
a start signal for the in-room heater 26, while the load start<br>
o,)-f corxdi-bioneY signal LDS2 is a start signal for the in-room-eeeier 27. When<br>
the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB has become the high level<br>
signal on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB,<br>
in other words, the inverter 12 is generating the converted<br>
output voltage, the voltage generation table 31 sets the load<br>
start signals LDS1 and LDS2 at ON signals and simultaneously<br>
0 \r cwndrfcpoe'n' brings the in-room heater 26 and in-room eealcr 27 into OK<br>
states. When the inverter 12 has fallen into the inverter stop<br>
state SC,   this inverter 12 does not generate the converted<br>
output voltage, and the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes<br>
a low level signal, so that the load start signals LDS1 and<br>
LDS2 become OFF signals, and both the in-room heater 26 and<br>
aiY conditioneT the in-room koo-fcer 2 7 are brought into OFF states.<br>
[0026]<br>
Next, an operation will be described. When the power<br>
running command FD is given to the inverter 12, this inverter<br>
12 converts DC electric power from the DC power feed circuit<br>
15 , into three-phase AC electric power and feeds the AC electric<br>
power to the AC electric motor 11, so that the DC voltage VD<br>
lowers. Besides, when the regenerative braking command FB is<br>
given to the inverter 12, the DC voltage VD rises on condition<br>
that a regenerative load on the side of the DC power feed line<br>
5 is low. In Embodiment 1, in a state where the power running<br>
command FD is given to the inverter 12, and a state where the<br><br>
regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes a high level signal, and both the load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 of the load control means 30 become ON signals on the basis of this inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, whereby the in-room heater 26 and the in-room eooloE- 27 fall into ON states, and the in-room heater 26 and in-room cooler- 27 are simultaneously fed with electric power from the auxiliary power source device 22. [0027]<br>
Even in the state where the in-room heater 2 6 and in-room<br>
■3JT' Co ncdtC'^T'<br>
ooolei" 27 are simultaneously operated, a temperature within the car room can be adjusted into a comfortable condition by appropriately setting the adjustment setting temperatures of<br>
the heater and ooaior.  By way of example, the adjustment<br>
our conM,
are both set at a comfortable temperature, for example, 20 (°C),<br>
whereby by way of example, in summer, the interior of the car<br>
room is brought into a cooled state as compared with the<br>
exterior of the car room, and in winter, the interior of the<br>
car room is brought into a heated state as compared with the<br>
exterior of the car room, so that the comfortable temperature<br>
can be established.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the state where the power running command FD is given<br>
to the inverter 12, the inverter 12 and the load 25 of the<br><br>
auxiliary power source device 2 2 form the regenerative load of another electric train connected to the identical DC power feed line 5, and the regenerative energy of the other electric train can be consumed. Besides, in the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 consumes the regenerative energy of the inverter 12. Besides, if the inverter 12 falls into the inverter stop state SC, the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes a low level signal, and both the load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 of the load control means 30 become OFF signals, so that both the in-room heater 26 and in-room ooole-r 27 of the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 are brought into OFF states. [0029]<br>
in this manner, in the control apparatus 10 for the electric train in Embodiment 1, in the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, the load control means 30 brings both the in-room heater 26 and in-room pooler 27 forming the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22, into the ON states, so that the inverter 12 and the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 form the regenerative load of the other electric train and can consume the regenerative energy of the other electric train. Besides, even in the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, the load control means 3 0 brings<br><br>
axn  eoyicLitfc/ie'*' both the in-room heater 26 and in-room ooel&amp;r 27 forming the<br>
load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22, into the ON<br>
states, so that the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device<br>
22 can be set as the regenerative load of the inverter 12 . Thus ,<br>
even if a regenerative load on the side of the DC power feed<br>
line 5 is insufficient, the load 25 of the auxiliary power<br>
source device 22 can be set as the regenerative load of the<br>
inverter 12, and the voltage rise of the DC power feed circuit<br>
15 can be suppressed. Accordingly, the regenerative energy<br>
can be consumed without adding a brake chopper or an<br>
electric-double-layer capacitor to the control apparatus 10,<br>
to bring forth the advantages that the wear of a brake shoe<br>
which affords mechanical braking during regenerative braking<br>
can be avoided, and that the control apparatus 10 can be made<br>
small in size.<br>
[0030]<br>
Besides, in Embodiment 1, the in-room heater 26 and<br>
cur Gjodifcio^"?* in-room aeo-lor 27 of the electric train 1 are simultaneously<br>
turned ON/OFF by the load control means 30. in this regard,<br>
even in the state where the in-room heater 26 and the in-room<br>
aoolar 27 are simultaneously operated, a temperature within<br>
the car room of the electric train 1 can be adjusted to a<br>
comfortable  temperature  by  appropriately  setting  the<br>
oj-r Cordifciow^ir adjustment setting temperatures of the heater and the gaalor.<br>

in Embodiment 1, the in-room heater 26  and the in-room<br>
■S-tY Conditioner<br>
cooler 27 which form the load 25 of the auxiliary power source<br>
device 22 are simultaneously ON/OFF-controlled by the load<br>
control means 30 on the basis of the inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FD/FB, whereas in this embodiment 2, detection means 20<br>
for detecting the DC power feed information DIF of a DC power<br>
feed circuit 15 is added to the DC power feed circuit 15, and<br>
CUT c.Tnckbcneir the in-room heater 26 and the in-room ewler 27 which form the<br>
load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 are<br>
simultaneously ON/OFF-controlled by the load control means 30A<br>
on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB and the<br>
DC power feed information DIF. The others are configured to<br>
be the same as in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0033]<br>
According to this embodiment 2, the in-room heater 26<br>
and the in-room cweler 27 which form the load 25 of the auxiliary<br>
power source device 22 are simultaneously ON/OFF-controlled<br>
on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB and the<br>
DC power feed information DIF of the DC power feed circuit 15,<br><br>
cttr condition*** so that the in-room heater 26 and the in-room oaalgr 27 which<br>
form the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 can<br>
be controlled more exactly in accordance with a load state on<br>
the side of a DC power feed line 5.<br>
[0034]<br>
The control apparatus for the electric train in Embodiment 2 is indicated by reference sign 10A. This control apparatus 10A for the electric train is such that the detection means 20 is added to the control apparatus 10 in Embodiment 1. This detection means 20 is concretely a voltage sensor, which detects a DC voltage VD applied across a smoothing capacitor 17 and which supplies the load control means 30A with the DC power feed information DIF representative of the DC voltage VD. [0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the load control means 3 0A in Embodiment 2 has a voltage generation table 32 and a logical product circuit (AND circuit) 33 in addition to a voltage generation table 31. The output of the voltage generation table 31 and the output of the voltage generation table 32 are both inputted to the logical product circuit 33, and this logical product circuit 33 generates load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 . The DC power feed information DIF from the detection means 2 0 is supplied to the voltage generation table 32'. This voltage generation table 32 outputs an ON signal when the DC<br><br>
voltage VD in the DC power feed circuit 15 has exceeded a predetermined voltage value VDl greater than the prescribed voltage VDO of the DC power feed line 5. By way of example, in a case where the prescribed voltage VDO of the DC power feed line 5 is 1500 (V), the predetermined voltage value VDl is set at 1850 - 1900 (V), and in a case where the prescribed voltage VDO is 750 (V), the predetermined voltage value VDl is set at 850 - 900 (V). [0036]<br>
The voltage generation table 32 of the load control means 30A outputs the ON signal when the DC voltage VD in the DC power feed circuit 15 has exceeded the predetermined voltage value VDl. Concretely, in a state where a power running command FD is given to an inverter 12, the inverter 12 converts DC electric power to three-phase AC electric power and feeds the AC electric power to an AC electric motor 11, so that the DC voltage VD lowers. However, in a case where regenerative energy from a plurality of other electric trains connected to the DC power feed line 5 is great, the DC voltage VD exceeds the predetermined voltage value VDl. Besides, in a state where a regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, this inverter 12 converts three-phase AC electric power generated by the AC electric motor 11, into DC electric power and feeds the DC electric power to the DC power feed circuit 15. Therefore, if a regenerative load on the side of the DC<br><br>
power feed line 5 is low, the DC voltage VD rises and exceeds<br>
the predetermined voltage value VD1.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the same manner as in Embodiment 1, the voltage<br>
generation table 31 outputs an ON signal on the basis of the<br>
inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, when this inverter state<br>
signal ICS-FD/FB has become a high level signal, in other words,<br>
when the inverter 12 is generating a converted output voltage,<br>
in the state where the power running command FD is given to<br>
the inverter 12, and in the state where the regenerative braking<br>
command FB is given to the inverter 12. When both the voltage<br>
generation tables 31 and 32 have outputted the ON signals, the<br>
logical product circuit 33 sets the load start signals LDS1<br>
and LDS2 at ON signals and brings both the in-room heater 26<br>
cur condition^ and in-room «e**er 2 7 of the load 25 into ON states.<br>
[0038]<br>
In this embodiment 2 , when the DC voltage VD has exceeded<br>
the predetermined voltage value VDl in the state where the power<br>
running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and when the<br>
DC voltage VD has exceeded the predetermined voltage value VDl<br>
in the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given<br>
air c(mclt*«fleir to the inverter 12, the in-room heater 26 and in-room aool^c<br>
27 of the load 25 are simultaneously started on the basis of<br>
the output voltage of the auxiliary power source device 22,<br>
and the DC electric power of the DC power feed circuit 15 can<br><br>
be effectively consumed. [0039]<br>
In both the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12 and the state where the regenerative braking command PB is given to the inverter 12, when the DC voltage VD in the DC power feed circuit 15 has lowered to the predetermined voltage value VDl or below, the ON signal fails to be outputted from the voltage generation table 32, so that both the load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 become OFF signals, and the power feed to the in-room heater 26 and in-room qoolar 27 of the load 25 is stopped, when the inverter 12 has fallen into an inverter stop state SC, the ON signal fails to be outputted from the voltage generation table 31, so that the power feed to the in-room heater 2 6 and in-room owler 2 7 of the load 2 5 is similarly stopped. [0040]<br>
In Embodiment 2, as in Embodiment 1, there are attained<br>
the advantages that regenerative energy can be effectively<br>
consumed, that the wear of a brake shoe which affords mechanical<br>
braking during regenerative braking can be avoided, and that<br>
the control apparatus 10A can be made small in size, without<br>
adding a brake chopper or an electric-double-layer capacitor<br>
COY c
in-room heater of the load 25 of the auxiliary power source<br>
device 22 are started on the basis of also the DC power feed<br><br>
information DIF of the DC power feed circuit 15, and hence, only when the load on the side of the DC power feed line 5 is low, the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 can be started, to attain the advantage that the energy can be effectively consumed. [0041]<br>
By the way, in Embodiment 2, the detection means 20 has been configured as the voltage sensor so as to detect the DC voltage VD from the voltage of the smoothing capacitor 17. However, the DC voltage of the DC power feed line 5 can also be detected on the input side of a reactor 16, and the same advantages can be attained in this case. Besides, preciser DC power feed information DIF can bo obtained in such a way that a current sensor is disposed in series with the reactor 16, that the DC electric power of the DC power feed circuit 15 is calculated on the basis of the voltage sensor output and current sensor output of the detection means 20, and that the calculated DC electric power is used as the DC power feed information DIF.

Fig. 5 is a block diagram showing Embodiment 3 of a control apparatus for an electric train according to this invention, while Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing the details of load control means 3 0B for use in this embodiment 3. The control<br><br>
apparatus for the electric train in this embodiment 3 is indicated by reference sign 10B. This control apparatus 10B for the electric train is such that the load control apparatus 30A in Embodiment 2 is replaced with the load control means 3OB, and the others are configured to be the same as in Embodiment 2. [0043]<br>
The load control means 3 OB for use in Embodiment 3 has voltage generation tables 31 and 3 2 and a logical product circuit 33, likewise to the load control means 30A used in Embodiment 2, but an inverter state signal ICS-FD is inputted to the voltage generation table 31. The inverter state signal ICS-FD is a signal representative of a powering command signal FD which is given to an inverter 12, and this inverter state signal ICS-FD becomes a high level signal in a state where the powering command signal FD is given to the inverter 12, whereas it becomes a low level signal in both a state where a regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter X 12. and a state where the inverter 12 has fallen into an inverter stop state SC. [0044]<br>
The voltage generation table 31 of the load control means 30B outputs an ON signal when the inverter state signal ICS-FD has become the high level signal, in other words, when the inverter 12 is generating a converted output voltage of AC,<br><br>
in the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12. In the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the inverter 12 has fallen into the inverter stop state SC, the inverter state signal ICS-FD becomes the low level signal, and hence, the voltage generation table 31 outputs an OFF signal. In the same manner as in Embodiment 2, the voltage generation table 32 of the load control means 30B outputs an ON signal when a DC voltage VD in a DC power feed circuit 15 has exceeded a predetermined voltage value VD1. In the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, this inverter 12 converts DC electric power from the DC power feed circuit 15, into three-phase AC electric power and feeds the AC electric power to an AC electric motor 11, so that the DC voltage VD lowers. However, in a case where regenerative electric power from a plurality of other electric trains connected to a DC power feed line 5 is great, the DC voltage VD exceeds the predetermined voltage value VDl. [0045]<br>
In a state where both the voltage generation tables 31 and 32 generate the ON signals, the logical product circuit 33 in Embodiment 3 sets load start signals LDSl and LDS2 at<br>
ON signals, so as to simultaneously start the in-room heater<br>
aif CtrndltiooeY 26 and in-room (soal»r  27 of the load 25 of an auxiliary power<br>
source device 22. In this embodiment 3, when the DC voltage<br><br>
VD has exceeded the predetermined voltage value VD1 in the state<br>
where the power running command FD is given to the inverter<br>
12, the load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 become the ON signals<br>

[0046]<br>
Accordingly, also in Embodiment 3, as in Embodiment 1,<br>
there are attained the advantages that the regenerative energy<br>
can be effectively consumed, that the wear of a brake shoe which<br>
affords mechanical braking during regenerative braking can be<br>
avoided, and that the control apparatus 10B can be made small<br>

when the load on the side of the DC power feed line 5 is low,<br>

the in-room heater 26 and in-room eeoirtm  27 of the load 25 of the auxiliary power source device 22 can be started. [0047] Embodiment 4:<br>
Fig. 7 is a block diagram showing Embodiment 4 of a control apparatus for an electric train according to this invention, while Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing the details of load<br><br>
control means 3 0C in this embodiment 4. The control apparatus<br>

electric train is such that the load control means 30A in<br>
Embodiment 2 is replaced with the load control means 3 0C, and<br>
the others are configured to be the same as  in Embodiment 2.<br>
[0048]<br>
The load control means 3 0C for use in Embodiment 4 has<br>
voltage generation tables 31 and 32 and a logical product<br>
circuit 33, likewise to the load control means 30A used in<br>
Embodiment 2, but an inverter state signal ICS-FB is inputted<br>
to the voltage generation table 31. The inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FB is a signal representative of a regenerative braking<br>
command FB which is given to an inverter 12, and this inverter<br>
state signal ICS-FB becomes a high level signal in a state where<br>
the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter<br>
U J-4", whereas it becomes a low level signal in both a state where<br>
a power running command FD is given to the inverter 12 and a<br>
state where the inverter 12 has fallen into an inverter stop<br>
state SC.<br>
[0049]<br>
The voltage generation table 31 of the load control means<br>
30C outputs an ON signal when the inverter state signal ICS-FB<br>
has become the high level signal, in other words, when the<br>
inverter 12 is generating a DC converted output voltage, in<br><br>
the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12. In the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the inverter 12 has fallen into the inverter stop state SC, the inverter state signal ICS-FB becomes the low level signal, and hence, the voltage generation table 31 outputs an OFF signal. In the same manner as in Embodiment 2, the voltage generation table 32 of the load control means 30C outputs an ON signal when a DC voltage VD in a DC power feed circuit 15 has exceeded a predetermined voltage value VDl by way of example. In the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, this inverter 12 converts three-phase AC electric power generated by an AC electric motor 11, into DC electric power and feeds the DC electric power to the DC power feed circuit 15, BO that if a regenerative load on the side of a DC power feed line 5 is low, the DC voltage VD of the DC power feed circuit 15 rises to exceed a predetermined voltage value VDl. [0050]<br>
In a state where both the voltage generation tables 31 and 32 generate the ON signals, the logical product circuit 33 in Embodiment 4 sets load start signals LDS1 and LDS2 at ON signals, so as to simultaneously start the in-room heater 26 and in-room oeeler 27 of the load 25 of an auxiliary power source device 22. In this embodiment 4, when the DC voltage<br><br>

Embodiment 5:<br>
Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing Embodiment 5 of a control<br>
apparatus for an electric train according to this invention,<br>
while Fig. 10 is a block diagram showing the details of load<br><br>
control means 30D for use in this embodiment 5. [0053]<br>
The control apparatus for the electric train in this embodiment 5 is indicated by reference sign 10D. This control<br>
apparatus 10D for the electric train has the load control means<br>
CUT conditioned 30D, by which an in-room heater 26 and an in-room coaler 27<br>
that are included in the load 2 5 of an auxiliary power source<br>
device 22 are controlled.  The load control means 30D is<br>
supplied with an inverter state signal ICS from an inverter<br>
12, and this inverter state signal ICS includes an inverter<br>
state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC and an inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FD/FB.  The load control means 30D ON/OFF-controls the<br>
cur conditioner in-room heater 2 6 and the in-room wmli:.'! 2 7 and also controls<br>
the load states thereof, on the basis of these inverter state<br>
signals ICS-FD/FB/SC and ICS-FD/FB. The others are configured<br>
to be the same as in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0054]<br>
The inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC becomes a high<br>
level signal in any of a state where a power running command<br>
FD is given to the inverter 12, a state where a regenerative<br>
braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, and a state<br>
where the inverter 12 has fallen into an inverter stop state<br>
sc.<br>
[0055]<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the load control means 30D has four<br><br>
voltage generation tables 34, 35, 36 and 37. The voltage generation table 34 is supplied with the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC. The inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC becomes the high level s ignal in any of the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the inverter 12 has fallen into the inverter stop state SC, so that the voltage generation table 34 sets a load start signal LDSa at an ON signal normally irrespective of whether the inverter 12 is generating a converted output voltage or is not generating the converted output voltage.<br>
The voltage generation table 35 is supplied with the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. This inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes a high level signal in the state where the power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and the state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12. The voltage generation table 35 sets a load start signal LDSb at an ON signal on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, when this inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB has become the high level signal, in other words, when the inverter 12 is generating the converted output voltage. [0056]<br>
The voltage generation tables 36 and 37 are supplied with the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. The voltage generation<br><br>
table 36 sets a high load signal LDTa at an ON signal on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, when this inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB has become the high level signal, in other words, when the inverter 12 is generating the converted output voltage. Besides, likewise to the voltage generation table 36, the voltage generation table 37 sets a high load signal LDTb at an ON signal on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, when this inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB has become the high level signal, in other words, when the inverter 12 is generating the converted output voltage. The high load signals LDTa and LDTb change the in-room heater 2 6 and the in-room CIUUILTL 2 7 from low load states into high load states when they have become the ON signals, respectively. [0057]<br>
The load start signals LDSa and LDSb and the high load signals LDTa and LDTb which are outputted from the load control means 3 0D are set into the following first states in summer:<br>
Load start signal LDSa: Start signal for in-room oaoleg 27<br>
Load start signal LDSb: Start signal for in-room heater<br>
26<br>
q,r conditioner<br>
High load signal LDTa: Signal for changing in-room wealti"<br>
27 into high load state<br>
High load signal LDTb: Signal for changing in-room heater 26 into high load state<br><br>
Concretely, in summer, the load start signal LDSa of the<br>
voltage generation table 34 normally becomes the ON signal on<br>
the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC, and the<br>
OJ^L  Conditioner in-room cooler 27 is normally started by the ON signal of the<br>
load start signal LDSa. When the power running command FD or<br>
the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter<br>
12, the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes the high level<br>
signal, and hence, all of the load start signal LDSb and the<br>
high load signals LDTa and LDTb which are outputted from the<br>
respective voltage generation tables 35, 3 6 and 3 7 become the<br>
ON signals. The in-room heater 26 is started by the ON signal<br>
of the load start signal LDSb. Besides, the adjustment setting<br>
air C5r\cUtK&gt;ney<br>
temperature of the in-room aa#i.ac 27 is lowered by the ON signal<br>
cur conditioner of the high load signal LDTa, and the in-room eaclog 27 changes<br>
into the high load state. Besides, the adjustment setting<br>
temperature of the in-room heater 26 is raised by the ON signal<br>
of the high load signal LDTb, and the in-room heater 26 falls<br>
into the high load state.<br>
[0059]<br>
ao-r conditioner in other words, in summer, the in-room wooler 2 7 is<br>
normally held in the ON state on the basis of the inverter state<br>
signal ICS-FD/FB/SC, thereby to normally cool the interior of<br>
a car room. Here, when the power running command FD or the<br>
regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12<br><br>
in the ON state of the in-room cooler 27, the in-room cooler 27 changes into the high load state, and the in-room heater<br>
26	operates in the high load state, on the basis of the inverter<br>
state signal ICS-FD/FB. Since the in-room heater 26 falls into<br>
the high load state, the consumption energy of the in-room<br>
heater 26 increases. Besides, since the in-room cooler 27<br>
falls into the high load state, the consumption energy of the<br>
in-room cooler 27 increases. Owing to the operations of the<br>
in-room cooler 27 and the in-room heater 26 in the high load<br>
states, the regenerative energy of a DC power feed circuit 15<br>
can be consumed more.<br>
[0060]<br>
The load start signals LDSa and LDSb and the high load signals LDTa and LDTb which are outputted from the load control means 3 0D are set into the following second states in winter:<br>
Load start signal LDSa: Start signal for in-room heater 26<br>
Load start signal LDSb: Start signal for in-room cooler 27<br>
High load signal LDTa: Signal for changing in-room cooler<br>
27	into high load state<br>
High load signal LDTb: Signal for changing in-room heater 26 into high load state [0061]<br>
Concretely, in winter, the load start signal LDSa of the<br><br>
Voltage generation table 34 normally becomes the ON signal on<br>
the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC, and the<br>
in-room heater 26 is normally started by the ON signal of the<br>
load start signal LDSa. When the power running command FD or<br>
the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter<br>
12, the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes the high level<br>
signal, and hence, all of the load start signal LDSb and the<br>
high load signals LDTa and LDTb of the respective voltage<br>
generation tables 35, 36 and 37 become the ON signals. The<br>
in-room eaaalor 27 is started by the ON signal of the load start<br>
signal LDSb. Besides, the adjustment setting temperature of<br>
the in-room eeolor 27 is lowered by the ON signal of the high<br>
CUT cspdtfcionfe-r load signal LDTa, and the in-room ooolej: 27 changes into the<br>
high load state. Besides, the adjustment setting temperature<br>
of the in-room heater 26 is raised by the ON signal of the high<br>
load signal LDTb, and the in-room heater 26 falls into the high<br>
load state.<br>
[0062]<br>
In other words, in winter, the in-room heater 2 6 is<br>
normally operated on the basis of the inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FD/FB/SC, thereby to normally heat the interior of the car<br>
room.  Here, when the power running command FD or the<br>
regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12<br>
in the ON state of the in-room heater 26, the in-room heater<br>
e\n~ Conditioner 26 changes into the high load state, and the in-room nnnlT<br><br>
27 operates in the high load state, on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. Since the in-room heater 26 falls into the high load state, the consumption energy of the in-room heater 26 increases. Besides, since the in-room «oa±e£ 27 falls into the high load state, the consumption energy of the<br>
in-room ooolor- 27 increases. Owing to the operations of the<br>
oJj\   conditioner in-room heater 26 and the in-room soolor 27 in the high load<br>
states, the regenerative energy of the DC power feed circuit<br>
15 can be consumed more,<br>
[0063]<br>
In this embodiment 5, when the power running command FD<br>
or the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter<br>
CUPL Condi-boreT 12, the in-room heater 2 6 and the in-room .oo»lor 2 7 are both<br>
operated in the high load states, and hence, the regenerative<br>
energy of the DC power feed circuit 15 is effectively consumed.<br>
Accordingly, also in Embodiment 5, as in Embodiment 1, there<br>
are attained the advantages that the regenerative energy can<br>
be effectively consumed, that the wear of a brake shoe which<br>
affords mechanical braking during regenerative braking can be<br>
avoided, and that the control apparatus 10D can be made small<br>
in  size,  without  adding  a  brake  chopper  or  an<br>
electric-double-layer capacitor to the control apparatus 10D.<br>
Besides, the adjustment setting temperatures of the in-room<br>
heater 26 and the in-room castor 27 are simultaneously altered,<br>
thereby to attain the advantage that, while a pleasant in-room<br><br>
temperature is being realized, the regenerative energy of the<br>
DC power feed circuit 15 can be further consumed.<br>
[0064]<br>
By the way, in spring or autumn, the signals are set in<br>
the same states as in either summer or winter.  In this case,<br>
OM conditioner the in-room heater 2 6 or the in-room cooler 2 7 is normally<br>
started by the voltage generation table 34, but in the inverter<br>
stop state sc, the adjustment setting temperature thereof is<br>
set in correspondence with spring or autumn, and the in-room<br>
QSM   dm d *tt oner" heater 26 or the in-room-eooLer 27 which is started by the output<br>
LDSa of the voltage generation table 34 is brought into the<br>
low load state.<br>

Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing Embodiment 6 of a control apparatus for an electric train according to this invention, while Fig. 12 is a block diagram showing the details of load control means 3 0E for use in Embodiment 6. [0066]<br>
The control apparatus for the electric train in this<br>
embodiment 6 is indicated by reference sign 10E. This control<br>
apparatus 10E for the electric train has the load control means<br>
that form the load 25 of an auxiliary power source device 22<br>
are controlled. The load control means 30E is supplied with<br><br>
an inverter state signal ICS from an inverter 12, and DC power feed information DIF from detection means 20. The inverter state signal ICS includes an inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC and an inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. The load control means 30E ON/OFF-controls the in-room heater 26 and the in-room eaolar 27 and also controls the load states thereof, on the basis of these inverter state signals ICS-FD/FB/SC and ICS-FD/FB and the DC power feed information DIF. The others are configured to be the same as in Embodiment 1. [0067]<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the load control means 30E has four voltage generation tables 41, 42, 43 and 44. The voltage generation table 41 is supplied with the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC. The inverter state signal ICs-FD/FB/SC becomes a high level signal in any of a state where a power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, a state where a regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12, and a state where the inverter 12 has fallen into an inverter stop state SC, so that the voltage generation table 41 sets a load start signal LDSa at an ON signal normally irrespective of whether the inverter 12 is generating a converted output voltage or is not generating the converted output voltage.<br>
The voltage generation table 42 is supplied with the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. This inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB becomes a high level signal in the state where the<br><br>
power running command FD is given to the inverter 12, and the<br>
state where the regenerative braking command FB is given to<br>
the inverter 12. The voltage generation table 42 sets a load<br>
start signal LDSb at an ON signal on the basis of the inverter<br>
state signal ICS-FD/FB, when this inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FD/FB has become the high level signal, in other words,<br>
when the inverter 12 is generating the converted output<br>
voltage.<br>
[0068]<br>
The voltage generation tables 4 3 and 44 are supplied with<br>
the DC power feed information DIF. The voltage generation<br>
table 43 generates a heater-set-temperature control signal<br>
LDT1 on the basis of the DC power feed information DIF, and<br>
the   voltage   generation   table   4 4   generates   a<br>
our   ctsnditfoner<br>
aeo-ler-set-temperature control signal LDT2 . As in Embodiment<br>
2, the DC power feed information DIF is a signal which<br>
represents the DC voltage VD of a DC power feed circuit 15.<br>
When the DC voltage VD has exceeded a predetermined voltage<br>
value VD1, the voltage generation table 43 enlarges the<br>
heater-set-temperature control signal LDTl on the basis of the<br>
DC power feed information DIF and in proportion to the magnitude<br>
of the excess voltage value (VD - VDl), thereby to raise an<br>
adjustment setting temperature for the in-room heater 26 and<br>
to control this in-room heater 26 into a high load state.<br>
Besides, when the DC voltage VD has exceeded the predetermined<br><br>
voltage value VDl, the voltage generation table 44 lowers the air CsrvJi-Hone*" ewler-set-temperature control signal LDT2 on the basis of the<br>
DC power feed information DIF and in proportion to the magnitude<br>
of the excess voltage value (VD - VDl), thereby to lower an<br>
adjustment setting temperature for the in-room oooler 27 and<br>
ai^ C<mc trendy to control this in-room coaler into a high load state.></mc>

In Embodiment 5, on the basis of the inverter state signal<br>
ICS-FD/FB, the in-room heater 2 6 or the in-room caolor 27 has<br>
been OK/OFF-controlled, and conjointly, the in-room heater 26<br>
and the in-room oeolor 2 7 have been controlled so as to change<br>
their load states, whereas in this embodiment 6, the inverter<br>
state signal ICS-FD/FB and the DC power feed information DIF<br>
are supplied to the load control means 30E, and the in-room<br>
CXM. conditioner heater 26 or the in-room eeoler 27 is ON/OFF-controlled on the<br>
basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB, and conjointly,<br>
the load states of the in-room heater 26 and the in-room-eoolof<br>
27 are changed on the basis of the DC power feed information<br>
DIF.<br>

Load start signal LDSa: Start signal for in-room a—lor<br><br>
Load start signal LDSb: Start signal for in-room heater 26 [00711<br>
Concretely, in summer, the load start signal LDSa of the voltage generation table 41 normally becomes the ON signal on<br>
the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB/SC, and the<br>
ax*   conditioned in-room ago Ire 27 is normally started by the ON signal of the<br>
load start signal LDSa. when the power running command FD or<br>
the regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter<br>
12, the load start signal LDSb of the voltage generation table<br>
42 becomes the ON signal. The in-room heater 26 is started<br>
by the ON signal of the load start signal LDSb. Besides, when<br>
the DC voltage VD exceeds the predetermined voltage value VD1,<br>
the heater-set-temperature control signal LDT1 rises in<br>
proportion to the magnitude of the excess voltage value (VD<br>
- VDl), and the consumption energy of the in-room heater 26<br>
increases in proportion to the excess voltage value (VD - VDl).<br>
Simultaneously, the &amp;eeie*-set-temperature control signal<br>
27 increases in proportion to the excess voltage value (VD -<br>
VDl) .<br>

normally operated on the basis of the inverter state signal<br>

room.  Here, when the power running command FD or the<br>
regenerative braking command FB is given to the inverter 12<br>
cXrr coneMrioner in the ON state of the in-room oool-or 27, the in-room heater<br>
26	is brought into its ON state on the basis of the inverter state signal ICS-FD/FB. Conjointly, when the DC voltage VD exceeds the predetermined voltage value VDl, the in-room eoa-lor<br>

15 can be effectively consumed by the operations of the in-room<br>
CMT conditioned<br>

normally held in the ON state on the basis of the inverter state<br>
signal ICS-FD/FB/SC, thereby to normally heat the interior of<br>
the car room. Here, when the power running command FD or the<br>

effectively consumed. Accordingly, also in Embodiment 6, as<br>
in Embodiment 1, there are attained the advantages that the<br>
regenerative energy can be effectively consumed, that the wear<br>
of a brake shoe which affords mechanical braking during<br>
regenerative braking can be avoided, and that the control<br>
apparatus 10E can be made small in size, without adding a brake<br>
chopper or an electric-double-layer capacitor to the control<br>
apparatus 10E. Besides, the adjustment setting temperatures<br>

simultaneously altered, thereby to attain the advantage that,<br>
while a pleasant in-room temperature is being realized, the<br>
