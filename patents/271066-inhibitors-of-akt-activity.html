				<td>The present invention relates to Inhibitors of Akt Activity<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to substituted naphthyridine compounds which are inhibitors of the activity of one or more of the isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as PKB; hereinafter referred to as "Akt"). The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using the instant compounds in the treatment of cancer.<br>
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays essential roles in embryonic development and pathogenesis of various diseases, such as degenerative neuronal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Recent work has led to the identification of various pro- and anti-apoptotic gene products that are involved in the regulation or execution of programmed cell death. Expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl2 or Bel-XL, inhibits apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as Bax or Bad, leads to programmed cell death (Adams et al. Science, 281:1322-1326 (1998)). The execution of programmed cell death is mediated by caspase-1 related proteinases, including caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8 and caspase-9 etc (Thornberry et al. Science, 281:1312-1316 (1998)).<br>
The phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway appears important for regulating cell survival/cell death (Kulik et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 17:1595-1606 (1997); Franke et al, Cell, 88:435-437 (1997); Kauffmann-Zeh et al. Nature 385:544-548 (1997) Hemmings Science, 275:628-630 (1997); Dudek et al., Science, 275:661-665 (1997)). Survival factors, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), promote cell survival under various conditions by inducing the activity of PI3K (Kulik et al. 1997, Hemmings 1997). Activated PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3), which in turn binds to, and promotes the activation of, the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain (Franke et al Cell, 81:727-736 (1995); Hemmings Science, 277:534 (1997); Downward, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 10:262-267 (1998), Alessi et al., EMBO J. 15: 6541-6551 (1996)). Specific inhibitors of PI3K or dominant negative Akt mutants abolish survival-promoting activities of these growth factors or cytokines. It has been previously disclosed that<br><br>
inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 or wortmannin) blocked the activation of Akt by upstream kinases. In addition, introduction of constitutively active PI3K or Akt mutants promotes cell survival under conditions in which cells normally undergo apoptotic cell death (Kulik et al. 1997, Dudek et al. 1997).<br>
Three members of the Akt subfamily of second-messenger regulated serine/threonine protein kinases have been identified and termed Akt I/ PKBa, Akt2/PKBß, and Akt3/PKB (hereinafter referred to as "Aktl", "Akt2" and "Akt3"), respectively. The isoforms are homologous, particularly in regions encoding the catalytic domains. Akts are activated by phosphorylation events occurring in response to PI3K signaling. PI3K phosphorylates membrane inositol phospholipids, generating the second messengers phosphatidyl-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which have been shown to bind to the PH domain of Akt. The current model of Akt activation proposes recruitment of the enzyme to the membrane by 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, where phosphorylation of the regulatory sites of Akt by the upstream kinases occurs (B.A. Hemmings, Science 275:628-630 (1997); B.A. Hemmings, Science 276:534 (1997); J. Downward, Science 279:673-674 (1998)).<br>
Phosphorylation of Aktl occurs on two regulatory sites, Thr308 in the catalytic domain activation loop and on Ser473 near the carboxy terminus (D. R. Alessi et al. EMBO J. 15:6541-6551 (1996) and R. Meier et al. J. Biol Chem. 272:30491-30497 (1997)). Equivalent regulatory phosphorylation sites occur in Akt2 and Akt3. The upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Akt at the activation loop site has been cloned and termed 3'-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 phosphorylates not only Akt, but also p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, p90RSK, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), and protein kinase C. The upstream kinase phosphorylating the regulatory site of Akt near the carboxy terminus has not been identified yet, but recent reports imply a role for the integrin-linked kinase (ILK-1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, or autophosphorylation.<br>
Analysis of Akt levels in human tumors showed that Akt2 is overotpressed in a significant number of ovarian (J. Q. Cheng et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UJ5~A. 89:9267-9271(1992)) and pancreatic cancers (J. Q. Cheng et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:3636-3641 (1996)). Similarly, Akt3 was found to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer cell lines (Nakatani et al. J. Biol. Chem. 274:21528-21532 (1999).<br>
The tumor suppressor PTEN, a protein and lipid phosphatase that specifically removes the 3' phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al. Science 275:1943-1947 (1997), Stambolic et al. Cell 95:29-39 (1998), Sun et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96:6199-6204 (1999)). Germline mutations of PTEN are responsible for human cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease (Liaw et al. Nature Genetics 16:64-67 (1997)). PTEN is deleted in a large percentage of human tumors and tumor cell lines without functional PTEN show elevated levels of activated Akt (Li et al. supra, Guldberg et al. Cancer Research 57:3660-3663 (1997), Risinger et al. Cancer Research 57:4736-4738 (1997)).<br>
These observations demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays important roles for regulating cell survival or apoptosis in tumorigenesis.<br>
Inhibition of Akt activation and activity can be achieved by inhibiting PI3K with inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin. However, PI3K inhibition has the potential to indiscriminately affect not just all three Akt isozymes but also other PH domain-containing signaling molecules that are dependent on PdtIns(3,4,5)-P3, such as the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, it has been disclosed that Akt can be activated by growth signals that are independent of PI3K.<br>
Alternatively, Akt activity can be inhibited by blocking the activity of the upstream kinase PDK1. No specific PDK1 inhibitors have been disclosed. Again, inhibition of PDK1 would result in inhibition of multiple protein kinases whose activities depend on PDK1, such as atypical PKC isoforms, SGK, and S6 kinases (Williams et al. Curr. Biol 10:439-448 (2000).<br>
It is an object of the instant invention to provide novel compounds that are inhibitors of Akt.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions that comprise the novel compounds that are inhibitors of Akt.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating cancer that comprises administering such inhibitors of Akt activity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention provides for substituted naphthyridine compounds that inhibit Akt activity. In particular, the compounds disclosed selectively inhibit one or two<br>
of the Akt isoforms. The invention also provides for compositions comprising such inhibitory compounds and methods of inhibiting Akt activity by administering the compound to a patient in need of treatment of cancer.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, all such stereoisomers being included in the present invention.<br>
In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted. For example the following is within the scope of the instant invention:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Tetrazoles exist as a mixture of 1H/2H tautomers. The tautomeric forms of the tetrazol moiety are also within the scope of the instant invention.<br>
When any variable (e.g. R.2, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents represent that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is bicyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable atoms on either ring of the bicyclic moiety.<br>
It is understood that one or more silicon (Si) atoms can be incorporated into the compounds of the instant invention in place of one or more carbon atoms by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art from readily available starting materials. Carbon and silicon differ in their covalent radius leading to differences in bond distance and the steric arrangement when comparing analogous C-element and Si-element bonds. These differences lead to subtle changes in the size and shape of silicon-containing compounds when compared to carbon. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that size and shape differences can lead to subtle or dramatic changes in potency, solubility, lack of off target activity, packaging properties, and so on. (Diass, J. O. et al. Organometallics (2006) 5:1188-1198; Showell, G.A. et al. Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2006) 16:2555-2558).<br>
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or<br>
on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase "optionally substituted with one or more substituents" should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase "optionally substituted with at least one substituent" and in such cases the preferred embodiment will have from zero to four substituents, and the more preferred embodiment will have from zero to three substituents.<br>
As used herein, "alky!" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C1-C10, as in "(C1-C10)alkyl" is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbons in a linear or branched arrange-ment. For example, "(C1-C10)alkyl" specifically includes methyl, ethyl, w-propyl, /-propyl, n-butyl, f-butyl, /-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and so on.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" means a monocyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "cycloalkyl" includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and so on.<br>
"Alkoxy" represents either a cyclic or non-cyclic alkyl group of indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. "Alkoxy" therefore encompasses the definitions of alkyl and cycloalkyl above.<br>
If no number of carbon atoms is specified, the term "alkenyl" refers to a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical, straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon double bond. Preferably one carbon to carbon double bond is present, and up to four non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bonds may be present. Thus, "(C2-C10)alkenyl" means an alkenyl radical having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 2-mcthylbutenyl and<br>
cyclohexenyl. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkenyl group may contain double bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkenyl group is indicated.<br>
The term "alkynyl" refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon triple bond. Up to three carbon-carbon triple bonds may be present. Thus, "(C2-C10)alkynyl" means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Alkynyl groups include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, 3-methylbutynyl and so on. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkynyl group may contain triple bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkynyl group is indicated.<br>
hi certain instances, substituents may be defined with a range of carbons that includes zero, such as (Co-C6)alkylene-aryl. If aryl is taken to be phenyl, this definition would include phenyl itself as well as -CH2Ph, -CH2CH2Ph, CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)Ph, and so on.<br>
As used herein, "aryl" is intended to mean any stable monocyclic or bicyclic carbon ring of up to 7 atoms in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic. Examples of such aryl elements include phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydro-naphthyl, indanyl and biphenyl. In cases where the aryl substituent is bicyclic and one ring is non-aromatic, it is understood that attachment is via the aromatic ring.<br>
The term heteroaryl, as used herein, represents a stable monocyclic or bicyclic ring of up to 7 atoms in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic and contains from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N and S. Heteroaryl groups within the scope of this definition include but are not limited to: acridinyl, carbazolyl, cinnolinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyrrazolyl, indolyl, benzotriazolyl, furanyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, benzofuranyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, indolyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, tetrahydroquinoline. As with the definition of heterocycle below, "heteroaryl" is also understood to include the N-oxide derivative of any nitrogen-containing heteroaryl. In cases where the heteroaryl substituent is bicyclic and one ring is non-aromatic or contains no heteroatoms, it is understood that attachment is via the aromatic ring or via the heteroatom containing ring, respectively. Such heteraoaryl moieties for substituent Q include but are not limited to: 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-quinolinyl, 3-quinolinyl, 4-quinolinyl, 1-isoqoinolinyl, 3-isoquinolinyl and 4-isoquinolinyl.<br>
The term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclyl" as used herein is intended to mean a 3-<br>
to 10-membered aromatic or nonaromatic heterocycle containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms<br>
selected from the group consisting of O, N and S, and includes bicyclic groups.<br>
"Heterocyclyl" therefore includes the above mentioned heteroaryls, as well as dihydro<br>
and tetrathydro analogs thereof. Further examples of "heterocyclyl" include, but are not<br>

Included in the instant invention is the free form of compounds of Formula A, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. Some of the isolated specific compounds exemplified herein are the protonated salts of amine compounds. The term "free form" refers to the amine compounds in non-salt form. The encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the isolated salts exemplified for the specific compounds described herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free form of compounds of Foonula A. The free form of the specific salt compounds described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example, the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise pharmaceutically equivalent to tknr respective free forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant compounds can be synthesized from the compounds of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic compounds are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.<br>
Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention as formed by reacting a basic instant compound with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, trifluoroacetic (TFA) and the like.<br>
When the compound of the present invention is acidic, suitable "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as argjnine, betaine caffeine, choline, N.N1-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamin, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like.<br>
The preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., 1977:66:1-19.<br>
It will also be noted that the compounds of the present invention are potentially internal salts or zwitterions, since under physiological conditions a deprotonated acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom.

Akt signaling regulates multiple critical steps in angiogenesis. Shiojima and Walsh, Circ. Res. (2002) 90:1243-1250. The utility of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer is known in the literature, see J. Rak et al. Cancer Research, 55:4575-4580, 1995 and Dredge et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2002) 2(8):953-966, for example. The role of angiogenesis in cancer has been shown in numerous types of cancer and tissues: breast carcinoma (G. Gasparini and A.L. Harris, J. Clin. Oncol., 1995, 13:765-782; M. Toi et al., Japan. J. Cancer Res., 1994, 85:1045-1049); bladder carcinomas (A.J. Dickinson et al., Br. J. Urol., 1994, 74:762-766); colon carcinomas (L.M. Ellis et al., Surgery, 1996, 120(5):871-878); and oral cavity tumors (J.K. Williams et al., Am. J. Surg., 1994, 168:373-380). Other cancers include, advanced tumors, hairy cell leukemia, melanoma, advanced head and neck, metastatic renal cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic breast, breast adenocarcinoma, advanced melanoma, pancreatic, gastric, glioblastoma, lung, ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, small ceB lung, renal cell carcinoma, various solid tumors, multiple myeloma, metastatic prostate, malignant glioma, renal cancer, lymphoma, refractory metastatic disease, refractory multiple myeloma, cervical cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, recurrent anaplastic glioma, and metastatic colon cancer (Dredge et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2002) 2(8):953-966). Thus, the Akt inhibitors disclosed in the instant application are also useful in the treatment of these angiogenesis related cancers.<br>
Tumors which have undergone neovascularization show an incrosed potential for metastasis, hi fact, angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. (S.P. Cunningham, et al., Can. Research, 61: 3206-3211 (2001)). The Akt inhibitors disclosed<br>
in the present application are therefore also useful to prevent or decrease tumor cell metastasis.<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a disease in which angiogenesis is implicated, which is comprised of administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention. Ocular neovascular diseases are an example of conditions where much of the resulting tissue damage can be attributed to aberrant infiltration of blood vessels in the eye (see WO 00/30651, published 2 June 2000). The undesireable infiltration can be triggered by ischemic retinopathy, such as that resulting from diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, retinal vein occlusions, etc., or by degenerative diseases, such as the choroidal neovascularization observed in age-related macular degeneration. Inhibiting the growth of blood vessels by administration of the present compounds would therefore prevent the infiltration of blood vessels and prevent or treat diseases where angiogenesis is implicated, such as ocular diseases like retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and the like.<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating or preventing a non-malignant disease in which angiogenesis is implicated, including but not limited to: ocular diseases (such as, retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration), atherosclerosis, arthritis, psoriasis, obesity and Alzheimer's disease (Dredge et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2002) 2(8):953-966). In another embodiment, a method of treating or preventing a disease in which angiogenesis is implicated includes: ocular diseases (such as, retinal vascularization, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration), atherosclerosis, arthritis and psoriasis.<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating hyperproliferative disorders such as restenosis, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and allergy/asthma.<br>
Further included within the scope of the instant invention is the use of the instant compounds to coat stents and therefore the use of the instant compounds on coated stents for the treatment and/or prevention of restenosis (WO03/032809).<br>
Further included within the scope of the instant invention is the use of the instant compounds for the treatment and/or prevention of osteoarthritis (WO03/035048).<br>
Further included within the scope of the invention is a method of treating tiyperinsulinism.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful in preparing a medicament that is useful in treating the diseases described above, in particular cancer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the instant compound is a selective inhibitor whose inhibitory efficacy is dependent on the PH domain.

The present invention is further directed to a method of inhibiting Akt activity which comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof a pharmaceutically effective amount of the instant compound.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered to mammals, including humans, either alone or, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, including the intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, rectal and topical routes of administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such<br>
compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium crosscarmellose, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to mask the unpleasant taste of the drug or delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a water soluble taste masking material such as hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, or a time delay material such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate buryrate may be employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water soluble carrier such as polyethyleneglycol or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture whh excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gun tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fitty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene onde with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids andahexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethyfcne oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for exampk polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more<br>
preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavouring agents, preservatives and antioxidants.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents* for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavoring and coloring agents and antioxidant.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of sterile injectable aqueous solutions. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulation.<br>
The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood-stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound, hi order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device may be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. hi addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. hi addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of Formula A may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula A are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
When a composition according to this invention is administered into a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the instant invention can be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and the type of cancer being treated; the severity (i.e., stage) of the cancer to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to treat, for example, to prevent, inhibit (fully or partially) or arrest the progress of the disease. For example, compounds of the instant invention can be administered in a total daily dose of up to 10,000 mg. Compounds of the instant invention can be administered once daily (QD), or divided into multiple daily doses such as twice daily (BID), and three times daily (TID). Compounds of the instant invention can be administered at a total daily dosage of up to 10,000 mg, e.g., 2,000 mg, 3,000 mg, 4,000 mg, 6,000 mg, 8,000 mg or 10,000 mg, which can be administered in one daily dose or can be divided into multiple daily doses as described above.<br>
For example, compounds of the instant invention can be administered in a total daily dose of up to 1,000 mg. Compounds of the instant invention can be administered once daily (QD), or divided into multiple daily doses such as twice daily (BID), and three times daily (TID). Compounds of the instant invention can be administered at a total daily dosage of up to 1,000 mg, e.g., 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg or 1,000<br>
mg, which can be administered in one daily dose or can be divided into multiple daily doses as described above.<br>
In addition, the administration can be continuous, i.e., every day, or intermittently. The terms "intermittent" or "intermittently" as used herein means stopping and starting at either regular or irregular intervals. For example, intermittent administration of a compound of the instant invention may be administration one to six days per week or it may mean administration in cycles (e.g. daily administration for two to eight consecutive weeks, then a rest period with no administration for up to one week) or it may mean administration on alternate days.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the instant invention may be administered according to any of the schedules described above, consecutively for a few weeks, followed by a rest period. For example, the compounds of the instant invention may be administered according to any one of the schedules described above from two to eight weeks, followed by a rest period of one week, or twice daily at a dose of 100 - 500 mg for three to five days a week, hi another particular embodiment, the compounds of the instant invention may be administered three times daily for two consecutive weeks, followed by one week of rest.<br>
Any one or more of the specific dosages and dosage schedules of the compounds of the instant invention, may also be applicable to any one or more of the therapeutic agents to be used in the combination treatment (hereinafter refered to as the "second therapeutic agent").<br>
Moreover, the specific dosage and dosage schedule of this second therapeutic agent can further vary, and the optimal dose, dosing schedule and route of administration will be determined based upon the specific second therapeutic agent that is being used.<br>
Of course, the route of administration of the compounds of the instant invention is independent of the route of administration of the second therapeutic agent, hi an embodiment, the administration for a compound of the instant invention is oral administration, hi another embodiment, the administration for a compound of the instant invention is intravenous administration. Thus, in accordance with these enibodiments, a compound of the instant invention is administered orally or intravenously, aad the second therapeutic agent can be administered orally, parenterally, inbaperitoneally, intravenously, intraarterially, transdermally, sublingually, intramusculariy, rectally,<br>
transbuccally, intranasally, liposomally, via inhalation, vaginally, intraoccularly, via local delivery by catheter or stent, subcutaneously, intraadiposally, intraarticularly, intrathecally, or in a slow release dosage form.<br>
In addition, a compound of the instant invention and second therapeutic agent may be administered by the same mode of administration, i.e. both agents administered e.g. orally, by IV. However, it is also within the scope of the present invention to administer a compound of the instant invention by one mode of administration, e.g. oral, and to administer the second therapeutic agent by another mode of administration, e.g. IV or any other ones of the administration modes described hereinabove.<br>
The first treatment procedure, administration of a compound of the instant invention, can take place prior to the second treatment procedure, i.e., the second therapeutic agent, after the treatment with the second therapeutic agent, at the same time as the treatment with the second therapeutic agent, or a combination thereof. For example, a total treatment period can be decided for a compound of the instant invention. The second therapeutic agent can be administered prior to onset of treatment with a compound of the instant invention or following treatment with a compound of the instant invention, hi addition, anti-cancer treatment can be administered during the period of administration of a compound of the instant invention but does not need to occur over the entire treatment period of a compound of the instant invention.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be prepared by employing reactions as shown in the following Reaction Schemes, in addition to other standard manipulations that are known in the literature or exemplified in the experimental procedures. The illustrative Reaction Schemes below, therefore, are not limited by the compounds listed or by any particular substituents employed for illustrative purposes. Substituent numbering as shown in the Reaction Schemes does not necessarily correlate to that used in the claims and often, for clarity, a single substituent is shown attached to the compound where multiple substituents are allowed under the definitions of Formula A hereinabove.<br>
Initial synthesis of the instant compounds are shown in Reactions Schemes I-IX. Final reactions that may be used to generate the compounds of this invention are shown in Reaction Schemes X-XIV. Synopsis of Reaction Schemes<br>
The following Reaction Schemes, Reaction Schemes I-IX, provide useful details for preparing the bicyclic moieties of the instant compounds.<br>
The requisite intermediates are in some cases commercially available, or can be prepared according to literature procedures. As illustrated in Reaction Scheme I, a<br>
suitably substituted phenylacetylide may be reacted with copper iodide to form the corresponding copper acetylide 1-1 (see for example, Sonogashira, K.; Toda, Y.; Hagihara, N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975, 4467). Intermediate 1-1 may then react with a suitably substituted electrophilic moiety to provide the asymetrically substituted 1-2. Reaction with NBS followed by hydrolysis provides 1-3 (see for example, Yusybov, M.S.; Filimonov, V.D.; Synthesis 1991, 2, 131). A variety of substituted and unsubstituted aryls and heterocyclyls may also be obtained commercially.<br>
Reaction Scheme II illustrates the preparation of the compounds, starting with a suitably substituted II-l. This intermediate can be reacted with a suitably substituted amine to provide intermediate II-2, which can be reacted with a suitable aryl or heteroaryl diamine to provide a regioisomeric mixture of the instant compounds, which can usually be separated chromatagraphically.<br>
Reaction Scheme III illustrates the synthesis of another bicyclic heterocyclyl.<br>
Reaction Scheme IV illustrates the preparation of compounds, starting with a suitably substituted 4-amino-3-nitrobenzonitrile IV-I. This intermediate can then subjected to a microwave promoted [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to afford tetrazole IV-II. Alkyaltion of the acidic tetrazole with an electrophile, such as methyl iodide, delivers a 2-methyl(IV-III)/l-methyl(rV-rV) mixture of alkylated tetrazoles which are separable by column chromatography. Ra-Ni hydrogenation of IV-III delivers the diamine IV-V. Further synthesis is as described in the Reaction Schemes above.<br>
Reaction Scheme V is illustrative for the synthesis of compounds. Friedlander cyclocondensation of a suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl aminoaldehyde with a suitably substituted ketone gives intermediates of formula V-l. Conversion of the carboxylic acid functionality to an aldehyde functionality gives intermediate V-2 and is accomplished by methods well known to someone skilled in the art Reductive alkylation with a suitably substituted amine provides compounds of formula V-3.<br>
Reaction Scheme VI illustrates an alternate synthesis of intermediate V-2.<br>
Reaction Scheme VII illustrates the synthesis of the compounds, starting with ketone VII-1 which is prepared according to literature (Renault, O.; Dallemagne, P.; and Rault, S. Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 1999, 31, 324). Condensation of VII-1 with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal gives keto-enamine VII-2, which cydizes with 2-cyanoacetamide to afford pyridone VII-3. Treatment of VII-3 with phosphorus<br>
oxychloride produces chloropyridin VII-4. Radical bromination followed by displacement with suitably substituted amines generates amines VII-5. Subsequent reaction of chloronicotinonitriles VII-5 with various bisnucleophiles provides the cyclized structures VII-6.<br>
                               Reaction Scheme VIII illustrates the preparation of the 1,6-nap        hthyridin-6( 5H)-one compounds. Synthesis starts with a commercially available carboxylic acid (VIII-1), which is converted to Weinreb amide (VIII-2). Reaction of amide with an aryl lithium reagent, generated through lithium-halogen exchange reaction of an aryl bromide with n-butyl lithium, provides the ketone (VIII-3) Condensation of this substituted ketone with 4-aminonicotinaldehyde in the presence <br><br>
a base, for example, sodium hydroxide or sodium methoxide, gives the 1,6-naphthyridine (VIII-4). The R substituent on the phenyl can be a functional group, such as, a (silyl)protected hydroxymethyl, the masked aldehyde (i.e. acetal), or a carboxylic acid. This material can be converted to the requisite aldehyde VIII-4. When the R group is hydroxymethyl, oxidation with a reagent such as activated manganese dioxide gives the aldehyde VIII-4. When R is an acetal, mild acid hydrolysis gives the aldehyde. Reduction of the carboxylic acid group via reduction of a mixed anhydride with a borohydride also gives the aldehyde VIII-4. This aldehyde can then undergo reductive animation with a diverse array of amines, for example, a 4-subtituted piperidine,  <br>
                             and  <br>
aborohydride to provide l,6-naphthyridin-5(H)-ones (VIII-5). Treatment of (VIII-5) with pyridinium hydrochloride at 150 °C furnishes the final product (VIII-6).<br>
Reaction Scheme DC illustrates an alternate strategy of introducing heterocycles at the C3-position. It starts with commercially available dichloro benzopyrazine, which can be coupled to an aryl boronic acid in the presence of a palladium catalyst (Suzuki reaction). Then a repeat of this reaction with another heterocyclic boronic acid provides the final product, under the same reaction conditions. Reaction Scheme I(Scheme Removed)<br>

Final Synopsis of Reaction Schemes<br>
The following Reaction Schemes, Reaction Schemes X-XIV, provide useful details for preparing the tricyclic moieties of the instant compounds.<br>
The requisite intermediates are in some cases commercially available, or can be prepared according to literature procedures. Treatment of a suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl intermediate X-l with POCla gives intermediates of formula X-2. Conversion of the chloride functionality to a hydrazide functionality gives intermediate X-3 and is accomplished by methods well known to someone skilled in the art. Cyclization with a suitably diimidazole precusor provides compounds of formula X-4.<br>
Reaction Scheme XI illustrates an alternate synthesis of compounds of formula X-4.<br>
Reaction Scheme XII illustrates synthesis of compounds of formula XII-2. Condensation of X-3 with appropriate trimethoxychloroacetate gives chloromethyl intermediate XII-1, which, via a nucleophilic displacement, affords structure XII-2.<br>
Reaction Scheme XIII illustrates the preparation of the triazolonaphthyridine compounds. Synthesis starts with literature/patent known naphthyridone (XIII-1), which is converted to naphthyridine chloride (XIII-2) after treatment of POCla under reflux condition. Reaction of the latter compound with neat hydrazine, and under reflux condition, provides the hydrazide (XIII-3) which serves as a key intermediate for the synthesis of triazolonaphthyridine compounds. Conversion of this hydrazide (XIII-4) to the requisite triazolonaphthyridine compounds under indicated conditions complete the planned synthesis. The R substituent on the triazolo moiety can be a functional group, such as, an amino group, an oxo group or a thiol group.<br>
Reaction Scheme XIV illustrates an alternate strategy of introducing the triazolo moiety at the left-hand portion of the molecule. It starts with previously synthesized intermediate hydrazide (XIII-3) which can be treated with a trimethoxy orthoacetate to furnish the desired final product, tiazolonaphthridine compounds (XIV-1). The R substituent on the triazolo moiety can be a functional group, such as, a proton, a simple alkyl group, a chloromethyl group or a functionalized alkyl group.<br>
Reaction Scheme XV illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XV-1 using three different reductive amination methods to introduce a primary amine at the benzylic position. The methods are also applicable to other aldehydes such as compounds of formula XVII-1.<br>
Reaction Scheme XVI illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XVI-2 using a variant of the conditions for the cyclocondensation shown in reaction Scheme VIII. Use of an aprotic solvent and a base gives access to chloronaphthyridines of structure XVI-2.<br>
Reaction Scheme XVII illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XVII-4. In this case a methyl substituent is introduced at the benzylic position via sulfinamide XV1I-2. Other substituents can be introduced using organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagents. The t-butylsulfinimide can be cleaved using an acid such as HC1 to give the amine.<br>
Reaction Scheme XVIII illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XVIII-2 as a variant of the triazole synthesis described in Reaction Scheme XI. In this case the hydrazine XVIII-1 is coupled to a carboxylic acid and the intermediate acylhydrazine is cyclized to the fused triazole under acid catalysis.<br>
Reaction Scheme XIX illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XIX-2 in which the cyclopropylamine is synthesized from the nitrile XIX-1.<br>
Reaction Scheme XX illustrates the synthesis of compounds of formula XX-2 from amines of formula XX-1 under standard reductive amination conditions. Reaction Scheme X<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Cloning of the human Akt isoforms and APH-Aktl<br><br>
The pS2neo vector (deposited in the ATCC on April 3, 2001 as ATCC PTA-3253) was prepared as follows: The pRmHA3 vector (prepared as described in Nucl. Acid Res. 16:1043-1061 (1988)) was cut with Bglll and a 2734 bp fragment was isolated. The pUChsneo vector (prepared as described in EMBO J. 4:167-171 (1985)) was also cut with Bglll and a 4029 bp band was isolated. These two isolated fragments were ligated together to generate a vector termed pS2neo-l. This plasmid contains a polylinker between a metallothionine promoter and an alcohol dehydrogenase poly A addition site. It also has a neo resistance gene driven by a heat shock promoter. The pS2neo-l vector was cut with PspSII and BsiWI. Two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized and then annealed (CTGCGGCCGC (SEQ.ID.NO.: 1) and GTACGCGGCCGCAG (SEQ.ID.NO.: 2)). The cut pS2neo-l and the annealed oligonucleotides were ligated together to generate a second vector, pS2neo. Added in this conversion was a NotI site to aid in the linearization prior to transfection into S2 cells.<br>
Human Aktl gene was amplified by PCR (Clontech) out of a human spleen cDNA (Clontech) using the 5' primer:<br>
5'CGCGAATTCAGATCTACCATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTG 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 3), and the 3' primer: 5'CGCTCTAGAGGATCCTCAGGCCGTGCTGCTGGC3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 4). The 5' primer included an EcoRI and BgHI site. The 3' primer included an Xbal and BamHI site for cloning purposes. The resultant PCR product was subcloned into pGEM3Z (Promega) as an EcoRI/Xba I fragment. For expression/purification purposes, a middle T tag was added to the 5' end of the full length Aktl gene using the PCR primer: 5'GTACGATGCTGAACGATATCTTCG 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 5). The resulting PCR product encompassed a 5' Kpnl site and a 3' BamHI site which were used to subclone the fragment in frame with a biotin tag containing insect cell expression vector, pS2neo.<br>
For the expression of a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) deleted (Aaa 4-129, which includes deletion of a portion of the Aktl hinge region) version of Aktl, PCR deletion mutagenesis was done using the full length Aktl gene in the pS2neo vector as template.  The PCR was carried out in 2 steps using overlapping internal primers (5'GAATACATGCCGATGGAAAGCGACGGGGCTGAAGAGATGGAGGTG3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 6), and 5'CCCCTCCATCTCTTCAGCCCCGTCGCTTTCCATCGGCATG TATTC 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 7)) which encompassed the deletion and 5' and 3' flanking primers which encompassed the Kpnl site and middle T tag on the 5' end. The final PCR product was digested with Kpnl and Smal and ligated into the pS2neo full length Aktl KpnI/Smal cut vector, effectively replacing the 5' end of the clone with the deleted version.<br>
Human Akt3 gene was amplified by PCR of adult brain cDNA (Clontech) using the amino terminal oligo primer:<br>
5' GAATTCAGATCTACCATGAGCGATGTTACCATTGTG 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 8); and the carboxy terminal oligo primer:<br>
5' TCTAGATCTTATTCTCGTCCACTTGCAGAG 3'(SEQ.ID.NO.: 9). These primers included a 5' EcoRI/Bglll site and a 3' Xbal/Bglll site for cloning purposes. The resultant PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and Xbal sites of pGEM4Z (Promega). For expression/purification purposes, a middle T tag was added to the 5' end of the full length Akt3 clone using the PCR primer: 5'GGTACCATGGAATACATGCCGATGGAAAGCGATGTTACCATTGTGAAG<br>
(SEQ.ID.NO.: 10). The resultant PCR product encompassed a 5' Kpnl site which allowed in frame cloning with the biotin tag containing insect cell expression vector, pS2neo.<br>
Human Akt2 gene was amplified by PCR from human thymus cDNA (Clontech) using the amino terminal oligo primer:<br>
5' AAGCTTAGATCTACCATGAATGAGGTGTCTGTC 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 11); and the carboxy terminal oligo primer: 5'GAATTCGGATCCTCACTCGCGGATGCTGGC 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 12). These primers included a 5' Hindlll/Bglll site and a 3' EcoRI/BamHI site for cloning purposes. The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the Hindlll/EcoRI sites of pGem3Z (Promega). For expression/purification purposes, a middle T tag was added to the 5' end of the full length Akt2 using the PCR primer:<br>
5 'GGTACCATGGAATACATGCCGATGGAAAATGAGGTGTCTGTCATCAAAG 3' (SEQ.ID.NO.: 13). The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the pS2neo vector as described above. EXAMPLE 2 Expression of human Akt isoforms and APH-Aktl<br>
The DNA containing the cloned Aktl, Akt2, Akt3 and APH-Aktl genes in the pS2neo expression vector was purified and used to transfect Drosophila S2 cells (ATCC) by the calcium phosphate method. Pools of antibiotic (G418, 500 |ig/ml) resistant cells were selected. Cell were expanded to a 1.0 L volume (-7.0 x 106 / ml), biotin and CuSO4 were added to a final concentration of 50 jiM and 50 mM respectively. Cells were grown for 72 h at 27°C and harvested by centrifugation. The cell paste was frozen at -70°C until needed. EXAMPLE 3 Purification of human Akt isoforms and APH-Aktl<br>
Cell paste from one liter of S2 cells, described in Example 2, was lysed by sonication with 50 mis 1% CHAPS in buffer A: (50mM Tris pH 7.4, ImM EDTA, ImM EGTA, 0.2mM AEBSF, 10|Ag/ml benzamidine, 5µg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin and pepstatin each, 10% glycerol and ImM DTT).

Akt/PKB containing fractions were pooled and the protein purity evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The purified<br>
protein was quantitated using a standard Bradford protocol.   Purified protein was flash frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
Akt and Akt pleckstrin homology domain deletions purified from S2 cells required activation.   Akt and Akt pleckstrin homology domain deletions were activated (Alessi et al. Current Biology 7:261-269) in a reaction containing 10 nM PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), lipid vesicles  (10  µM phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate  - Metreya, Inc,   100  pM phosphatidylcholine and 100 µM phosphatidylserine - Avanti Polar lipids, Inc.) and activation buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 1.0 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1.0 ¸µM Microcystin-LR, 0.1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 333 µg/ml BSA and O.lmM EDTA). The reaction was incubated at 22°C for 4 hours. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. EXAMPLE 4 Akt Kinase Assays<br>
Activated Akt isoforms and pleckstrin homology domain deletion constructs were assayed utilizing a GSK-derived biotinylated peptide substrate. The extent of peptide phosphorylation was determined by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) using a lanthanide chelate(Lance)-coupled monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphopeptide in combination with a streptavidin-linked allophycocyanin (SA-APC) fluorophorc which will bind to the biotin moiety on the peptide. When the Lance and APC are in proximity (i.e. bound to the same phosphopeptide molecule), a non-radiative energy transfer takes place from the Lance to the APC, followed by emission of light from APC at 665 nm.

EXAMPLE 7 Inhibition Of Tumor Growth<br>
In vivo efficacy of an inhibitor of the growth of cancer cells may be confirmed by several protocols well known in the art.<br>
Human tumor cell lines which exhibit a deregulation of the PI3K pathway (such as LnCaP, PC3, C33a, OVCAR-3, MDA-MB-468, A2780 or the like) are injected subcutaneously<br>
to the left flank of 6-10 week old female nude (also male mice [age 10-14 weeks] are used for prostate tumor xenografts [LnCaP and PC3]) mice (Harlan) on day 0. The mice are randomly assigned to a vehicle, compound or combination treatment group. Daily subcutaneous administration begins on day 1 and continues for the duration of the experiment. Alternatively, the inhibitor test compound may be administered by a continuous infusion pump. Compound, compound combination or vehicle is delivered in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Tumors are excised and weighed when all of the vehicle-treated animals exhibited lesions of 0.5 -1.0 cm in diameter, typically 4 to 5.5 weeks after the cells were injected. The average weight of the tumors in each treatment group for each cell line is calculated. EXAMPLE 8 Spot Multiplex Assay<br>
This procedure describes a sandwich immunoassay used to detect multiple phosphorylated proteins in the same well of a 96 well format plate. Cell lysates are incubated in 96-well plates on which different capture antibodies are placed on spatially distinct spots in the same well. Phoshorylation-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies are added and the complex is detected by an anti-rabbit antibody labeled with an electrochemiluminescent tag. 96-Well LNCaP plates +/- Compounds:<br>

This procedure describes a cell-based (in vivo) activity assay for the Akt serine/threonine kinase. Activated endogenous Akt is capable of phosphorylatinga specific Akt substrate (GSK3P) peptide which is biotinylated. Detection is performed by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) using a Europium Kryptate [Eu(K)] coupled antibody specific for the phosphopeptide and streptavidin linked XL665 fluorophore which will bind to the biotin moiety on the peptide. When the [Eu(K)] and XL665 are in proximity (i.e. bound to the same phosphopeptide molecule) a non-radiative energy transfer takes place from the Eu(K) to the XL665, followed by emission of light from XL665 at 665 nm.<br>
The assay can be used to detect inhibitors of all three Akt isozymes (Aktl, Akt2, and Akt3) from multiple different species if specific antibodies to each exist. MATERIALS AND REAGENTS<br>
