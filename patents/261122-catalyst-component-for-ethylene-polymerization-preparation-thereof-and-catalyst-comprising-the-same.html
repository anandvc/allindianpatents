The present application claims the benefit of the Chinese Patent Application No.<br>
200510117427.0, filed on October 31, 2005, and the Chinese Patent Application No.<br>
200510117428.5, filed on October 31, 2005, which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety and for all purposes.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst component for ethylene polymerization, to<br>
preparation thereof, and to a catalyst comprising the same.<br>
Background<br>
It is known that catalyst systems containing titanium and magnesium are predominant<br>
catalysts in commercial production of polyethylene. The research on such catalysts focuses<br>
mainly on catalytic activity, particle morphology and particle size distribution of catalyst,<br>
hydrogen response of catalyst, copolymerization property of catalyst, etc. In slurry process of<br>
ethylene polymerization, it is required that the catalyst used has a high catalytic activity, and the<br>
control of the particle size and the particle size distribution of the produced ethylene polymer is<br>
also very important. In ethylene polymerization, in particular, ethylene slurry polymerization, fine<br>
polymer particles are easily produced, and such fines will likely cause the generation of static<br>
charges and "dust" phenomenon, and sometimes result in the formation of agglomerates, which<br>
might block pipes of the production plant. The most effective approach for controlling the particle<br>
size and the particle size distribution of a polymer is to control the particle size and the particle<br>
size distribution of the catalyst.<br>
In the prior art, in order to obtain a catalyst having uniform particle diameter and better<br>
particle morphology, the following two methods are generally utilized to prepare the catalysts.<br>
In the first method, a magnesium compound, for example magnesium dichloride, is dissolved<br>
in a solvent to form a homogeneous solution, then the solution is combined with a titanium<br>
compound and optionally an electron donor compound, to precipitate solids comprising<br>
magnesium, titanium, and optionally the electron donor compound. The solids are further treated<br>
with a liquid titanium compound to give the particulate catalyst. See, for example, CN1099041A<br><br>
and CN1229092A. This conventional method has a drawback that the particle size and particle<br>
size distribution of the catalyst particles are controlled fully through the precipitation process,<br>
which is a process of recrystallizing magnesium-containing support and of which stable control is<br>
difficult.<br>
For example, Patent Application CN1229092 discloses a catalyst component containing<br>
magnesium dichloride as support and titanium tetrachloride as active component, which catalyst<br>
component is prepared by dissolving MgCl2 in a solvent system to form a homogeneous solution<br>
then reacting the solution with TiCl4 at low temperature in the presence of precipitator, phthalic<br>
anhydride, and raising slowly the temperature to precipitate solid catalyst component. When so<br>
prepared catalyst component is used in ethylene polymerization, the obtained polymers have<br>
good particle morphology, however, hydrogen response and catalytic activity of the catalyst are<br>
still not satisfied. Additionally, in the preparation of the catalyst component, it is necessary to use<br>
organic substance such as phthalic anhydride as precipitator to facilitate the precipitation of solids<br>
and a large amount of titanium tetrachloride is required. Therefore, on the one hand, the presence<br>
of an anhydride may adversely affect the catalyst, and on the other hand, the use of a large<br>
amount of titanium tetrachloride will increase the production cost of the catalyst and aggravate<br>
the problem of environmental pollution. Furthermore, such a reaction system is likely viscous so<br>
that the preparation of catalyst is difficult.<br>
In the second method, an active component of a catalyst is supported directly on an inert<br>
support, for example, silica and the like. Since silicas have particle diameters easily controlled<br>
and good particle morphology, paniculate catalysts having uniform particles can be obtained.<br>
However, because the loaded amount of an active component on a support is limited, a<br>
so-prepared catalyst has a lower Ti content and thereby a lower polymerization activity. For<br>
example, Patent Application CN1268520 discloses a catalyst component containing magnesium<br>
dichloride and silica as support and titanium tetrachloride as active component, which catalyst<br>
component is prepared by reacting MgCl2 with TiCl4 in THF, combining the reaction mixture<br>
with SiO2 which has been treated with an alkyl aluminum, and removing THF to form the<br>
catalyst component. Since the catalyst component has a lower Ti content, it exhibits lower<br>
catalytic activity when used in ethylene polymerization. Therefore, although this catalyst system<br>
is applicable to gas phase fluidized bed process of ethylene polymerization, it is not suitable for<br>
slurry process of ethylene polymerization due to its lower catalytic activity.<br>
It is well known that, in slurry process of ethylene polymerization, in addition to high<br>
catalytic activity and desired particle size distribution, the catalysts used are required to have<br>
good hydrogen response in order to produce ethylene homopolymer and copolymer having good<br>
properties, in other words, the melt indices of the final polymers should be easily regulated by<br><br>
English translation of PCT publication document<br>
changing hydrogen partial pressure during the polymerization to obtain different commercial<br>
grades of polyethylene resin. However, the aforesaid catalyst systems are still not satisfied in<br>
hydrogen response.<br>
Thus, it is very desired to provide a catalyst useful in ethylene polymerization, especially<br>
slurry polymerization, which should have high catalytic activity, uniform particle diameter,<br>
narrow particle size distribution, and good hydrogen response.<br>

According to the invention, the finally obtained solid titanium-containing catalyst component<br>
should comprise the silicon compound in a sufficient amount so as to improve the combined<br>
properties of the catalyst. At the same time, the silicon compound also functions as a precipitator,<br>
which facilitates the precipitation of the particles of the catalyst component. According to an<br>
embodiment of the invention, in the preparation of the solid catalyst component, it is possible to<br>
utilize other silicon compounds capable of forming in situ the alkoxy group-containing organic<br>
silicon compounds mentioned above, for example, silicon tetrachloride.<br>
As indicated above, the catalyst component for ethylene polymerization according to the<br>
invention comprises a reaction product of the magnesium complex, the at least one titanium<br>
compound, the at least one alcohol compound, the at least one silicon compound, and optionally<br>
the organic aluminum compound, wherein the individual reactants are used in the following<br>
amounts: 0.1 to 10 moles, and preferably 1 to 4 moles for the alcohol compound; 0.05 to 1 moles<br>
for the organic silicon compound; 0 to 5 moles for the organic aluminum compound; and 1 to 15<br>
moles, and preferably 2 to 10 moles for the titanium compound, with respect to one mole of the<br>
magnesium halide.<br>
In an embodiment, the catalyst component according to the invention consists essentially of<br>
the aforesaid reaction product. Such a catalyst component may comprise: Ti: 4.0 to 7.5 wt%, Mg:<br>
14 to 19 wt%, Cl: 58 to 68 wt%, Si: 0.2 to 1.2 wt%, alkoxy group: 4.0 to 8.5 wt%, P: 0.1 to 1.0<br><br>
wt%, and Al: 0 to 0.6 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst component of the invention may be obtained as a<br>
supported form on an inorganic oxide support.<br>
Examples of the inorganic oxide support include, but are not limited to, SiO2, AI2O3, and<br>
mixtures thereof, and are commercially available. The supports are generally of spherical shape,<br>
and have an average particle diameter of from 0.1 µm to 150µm, preferably from l µm to 50µm,<br>
and most preferably from 5µm to 40µm. It is preferable to use a silica having a large specific<br>
surface area, preferably from 80m2/g to 300 m2/g, as the support. Such a silica support is in favor<br>
of enhancing the loaded amount of a magnesium compound in the catalyst component, and<br>
thereby enhancing the loaded amount of the active component of the catalyst, and of preventing<br>
the phenomenon that, when magnesium content is higher, irregular agglomerates of a magnesium<br>
halide are present in the catalyst component so that the particle morphology of the catalyst<br>
component is inferior. Prior to use, the inert supports are preferably subjected to a dewatering<br>
treatment by calcination or an activating treatment by alkylation. If used, the inorganic oxide<br>
supports are used in an amount of from 40 to 400 grams, and preferably from 80 to 250 grams,<br>
with respect to one mole of the magnesium halide in the magnesium complex.<br>
When obtained as a supported form on an inorganic oxide support, the catalyst component<br>
according to the invention comprises: Ti: 1.5 to 4.5 wt%; Mg: 4 to 14 wt%; Cl: 20 to 40 wt%;<br>
alkoxy group: 1.5 to 4.5 wt%; P: 0.05 to 0.5 wt%; Al: 0 to 0.4 wt%; and the inert support: 20 to<br>
80 wt%. It is understood that such catalyst components further comprise Si derived from the<br>
organic silicon compounds.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing the catalyst<br>
component according to the invention, comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	dissolving the magnesium halide in a solvent system comprising the organic epoxy<br>
compound and the organic phosphorus compound, the solvent system optionally but preferably<br>
further comprising the inert diluent, to form a homogeneous solution;<br>
(2)	adding the alcohol compound before, during or after the formation of the homogeneous<br>
solution, to finally form a magnesium halide-containing solution;<br>
(3)	contacting the solution obtained from step (2) with the titanium compound, with the<br>
silicon compound being added before, during or after the contacting, to form a mixture;<br>
(4)	heating the mixture slowly to a temperature of from 60 °C to 110 °C and maintaining at<br>
that temperature for a period of time, solids gradually precipitating during the heating; and<br>
(5)	recovering the solids formed in the step (4), to obtain the catalyst component.<br>
In the step (1), the temperature for dissolution may be in a range of from 40 to 110 °C, and<br>
preferably from 50 to 90 °C. The time for which the step (1) is conducted is not especially limited.<br><br>
however, it is generally preferable to maintain further a period of time of from 20 minutes to 5<br>
hours, and preferably from 30 minutes to 2 hours after the solution has become clear.<br>
Before, during or after dissolving the magnesium halide in the solvent system comprising the<br>
organic epoxy compound and the organic phosphorus compound to form the homogeneous<br>
solution, the alcohol compound is added to the reaction mixture. If the alcohol compound is<br>
added before or during the formation of the homogeneous solution, then the formed<br>
homogeneous solution is just the magnesium halide-containing solution from the step (2). If the<br>
alcohol compound is added after the formation of the homogeneous solution, then it is preferable<br>
to stir the reaction mixture at a temperature of from 0 to 110 °C, and preferably from room<br>
temperature to 90 °C for from 10 minutes to 5 hours, and preferably from 20 minutes to 2 hours,<br>
to form the magnesium halide-containing solution. For convenience, it is preferable to add the<br>
alcohol compound before or during the formation of the homogeneous solution.<br>
Prior to the step (3), the organic aluminum compound is optionally added to the magnesium<br>
halide-containing solution from the step (2) and the resultant mixture is allowed to react for a<br>
period of time, preferably from 10 minetes to 5 hours, and more preferably from 30 minetes to 2<br>
hours. This reaction may be performed at a temperature of from 0 to 80°C, and preferably from<br>
room temperature to 50°C.<br>
The step (3) is generally conducted at a low temperature, preferably at a temperature of from<br>
-40 °C to 20 °C.<br>
In the step (4), after the reaction mixture is heated slowly to the desired temperature, it may<br>
be maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes to 5 hours, and preferably 1 to 3 hours.<br>
The recovering operation of the step (5) includes, for example, filtering and washing with an<br>
inert diluent, and optionally drying. The recovering operation may be performed according to<br>
conventional processes known in the art.<br>
Those skilled in the art will understand that the above preparation method is generally<br>
performed throughout under an inert atmosphere, for example, nitrogen or argon atmosphere.<br>
In an embodiment, a combination of the alcohol compounds, for example, a combination of<br>
ethanol and 2-ethylhexanol, is used. The alcohols constituting the combination of the alcohol<br>
compounds can be added simultaneously or separately.<br>
In another embodiment, the reaction in the step (3) or (4) is carried out in the presence of the<br>
inorganic oxide support, to obtain the catalyst component of the invention supported on the<br>
inorganic oxide support.<br>
In still another aspect, the invention provides a catalyst for ethylene polymerization, which<br>
comprises a reaction product of: (1) said catalyst component according to the invention; and (2)<br>
an organoaluminum cocatalyst of formula AIR5nX23-n, in which R5 is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl<br><br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular, an alkyl, an aralkyl, or an aryl; X2 is a halogen, in<br>
particular chlorine or bromine; and n is a value satisfying 1 
In an embodiment, the catalyst according to the invention consists of the reaction product of<br>
the component (1) and the component (2).<br>
Examples of the organoaluminum cocatalyst include trimethyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum,<br>
triisobutyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, diethyl aluminum hydride, diisobutyl aluminum hydride,<br>
diethyl aluminum chloride, di-isobutyl aluminum chloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl<br>
aluminum dichloride, and the like. Among these, trialkyl aluminums are preferable, and triethyl<br>
aluminum and triisobutyl aluminum are more preferable. These organoaluminum cocatalysts may<br>
be used alone or in combination.<br>
In the catalyst according to the invention, the molar ratio of aluminum in the component (2)<br>
to titanium in the component (1) is in a range of from 5 to 500, and preferably from 20 to 200.<br>
In still another aspect, the invention provides a process for ethylene polymerization, which<br>
process comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) contacting ethylene and optionally at least one comonomer with the catalyst according to<br>
the invention under polymerization conditions, to form a polymer; and<br>
(ii) recovering the polymer formed in the step (i).<br>
The comonomer may be selected from the group consisting of a-olefins and dienes, having<br>
from 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of the -olefins include propylene, 1-butene,<br>
4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, styrene, methyl styrene, and the like. Examples of the<br>
dienes include cyclopentadiene, vinyl norbornene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, and the like.<br>
The polymerization process can be carried out in liquid phase or gas phase. The catalyst<br>
according to the invention is especially suitable for a slurry polymerization process, or a<br>
combined polymerization process including slurry phase polymerization, for example, a process<br>
consisting of slurry phase polymerization and gas phase polymerization.<br>
Examples of media useful in the liquid phase polymerization include saturated aliphatic and<br>
aromatic inert solvents, such as propane, isobutane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, naphtha,<br>
raffinate, hydrogenated gasoline, kerosene, benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like.<br>
In order to regulate the molecular weight of the final polymers, hydrogen gas is used as a<br>
molecular weight regulator in the polymerization process according to the invention.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention utilize organic silicon compounds having no active<br>
hydrogen as precipitators, so that during the preparation of the catalyst component, particles of<br>
the catalyst component can be easily precipitated. Thus, there is not need to use a large amount of<br>
titanium tetrachloride to facilitate the precipitation of solids and to treat the solids with titanium<br>
tetrachloride more than one times. As a result, the amount of titanium tetrachloride used can be<br><br>
reduced significantly. At the same time, the incorporation of the organic silicon compound<br>
contributes to the enhancement of the activity of the catalysts and the improvement of the particle<br>
morphology of the catalyst components as well as the improvement of the particle morphology of<br>
the polymers. When used in ethylene polymerization, the catalysts according to the invention<br>
exhibit good hydrogen response.<br>

4.0ml of tributyl phosphate, and 6.4ml of ethanol. The mixture was heated to 70°C with stirring.<br>
After the solids had been completely dissolved to form a homogeneous solution, the mixture was<br>
maintained at 70°C for further one hour. The solution was cooled to 30 °C, then 4.8 ml of 2.2M<br>
solution of diethyl aluminum chloride in toluene were added dropwise thereto, and the reaction<br>
was maintained at 30 °C for one hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to -5°C, and 40ml of TiCl4<br>
were added dropwise and slowly thereto, and then 3 ml of tetraethoxy silicane were added. The<br>
reaction was allowed to continue for one hour. Then the temperature was raised slowly to 80°C,<br>
and the reaction was allowed to continue at that temperature for 2 hours. Then the stirring was<br>
stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand still. The suspension was observed to<br>
separate very quickly into layers. After removing the supernatant, the residue was washed with<br>
toluene twice and with hexane for four times, and then dried by passing a flow of high pure N2<br>
therethrough. A solid catalyst component having good flowability and narrow particle size<br>
distribution was obtained. The composition of the catalyst component is shown in Table 1 below.<br>

ml of hexane through stirring, to form a suspension of the solid catalyst component in hexane<br>
useful in ethylene polymerization.<br>

until the pressure reached 0.28MPa (gauge), then ethylene was added thereto until the total<br><br>
pressure inside the reactor reached 0.73MPa (gauge). The polymerization reaction was allowed to<br>
continue at 80 °C for 2 hours, with ethylene being supplied to maintain the total pressure of<br>
0.73MPa (gauge). The polymerization results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>

Example 13<br>
(1) Preparation of a catalyst component<br>
To a reactor, in which air had been sufficiently replaced with high pure N2, were charged<br>
successively with 8.0 Kg of magnesium dichloride, 100 liters of toluene, 4.0 liters of epoxy<br>
chloropropane, 12 liters of tributyl phosphate, and 6.9 liters of ethanol. The mixture was heated to<br>
70°C with stirring. After the solids had been completely dissolved to form a homogeneous<br>
solution, the mixture was maintained at 70°C for further one hour. The reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to -5°C, and 120 liters of TiCl4 were added slowly thereto, and then 6.0 liters of<br>
tetraethoxy silicane were added. The reaction was allowed to continue for one hour. Then the<br>
temperature was raised slowly to 80°C, and the reaction was allowed to continue at that<br>
temperature for 2 hours. Then the stirring was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to<br>
stand still. The suspension was observed to separate very quickly into layers. After removing the<br><br>
supernatant, the residue was washed with hexane for four times, and then dried under vacuum. A<br>
solid catalyst component having good flowability and narrow particle size distribution was<br>
obtained. The composition of the catalyst component is shown in Table 1 below.<br>
(2) Ethylene polymerization was carried out according to the procedure as described in<br>
Example 1. The polymerization results are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
(1)	A catalyst component was prepared according to the procedure as described in Example 4,<br>
except that tetraethoxysilicane was replaced with phthalic anhydride.<br>
(2)	Ethylene polymerization was carried out according to the procedure as described in<br>
Example 4. The composition of the catalyst component and the polymerization results are shown<br>
in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
(1) The procedure as described in Example 4 (1) was repeated, except that tetraethoxysilicane<br>
was not used. It was observed that the precipitation of the catalyst component was difficult, and<br>
the precipitated particles were extremely fine so that settlement was very difficult. Therefore, no<br>
catalyst component was obtained.<br>
It can be seen from the polymerization results shown in Table 2 that, under the same<br>
polymerization conditions, the catalysts according to the invention exhibit higher activities.<br>
Furthermore, due to the incorporation of the organic silicon compounds into the catalyst<br>
components according to the invention, the precipitation of the catalyst components was easier,<br>
the particle size distribution of the resultant polymers was narrower than that in Comparative<br>
Example 1 (using phthalic anhydride as precipitator), and both the excessively large particles and<br>
the excessively small particles are less.<br><br><br>
It should be understood that, in addition to the main components as shown in the above table,<br>
the catalyst components may further contain solvent (volatiles) and species derived from the<br>
organo phosphorus compound, the organic epoxy compound, the organic aluminum compound,<br>
and the like.<br><br>

reaction mixture, and the reaction was allowed to continue with stirring for 0.5 hours. Next, 3 ml<br>
of tetraethoxy silicane were added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was allowed to<br>
continue for 1 hour. Then the temperature was raised slowly to 85 °C, and the reaction was<br>
allowed to continue for 2 hours. Then the stirring was stopped and the reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to stand still. The suspension was observed to separate very quickly into layers. After<br>
removing the supernatant, the residue was washed with toluene twice and with hexane for four<br>
times, and then dried by passing a flow of high pure N2 therethrough. A solid catalyst component<br>
having good flowability and narrow particle size distribution was obtained.<br>
