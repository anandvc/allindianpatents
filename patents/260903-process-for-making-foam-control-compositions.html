				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING AND USING FOAM CONTROL COMPOSITIONS<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for making foam control compositions,<br>
especially compositions which are of use in aqueous media, such as the paper making and<br>
pulping process, textile dyeing process, inks, coatings, paints, detergents, waste water<br>
treatment, the scrubbing of natural gas and metal working process. In particular the<br>
invention relates to a process of making foam control compositions which comprise silicone<br>
materials, in particular branched or cross-linked silicone materials. The invention also<br>
relates to the foam control compositions thus made and to the different systems and<br>
processes, such as inks, coatings, paints, detergents, black liquor, and pulp and paper<br>
manufacture, waste water treatment, textile dyeing processes, metal working process and<br>
the scrubbing of natural gas, using such foam control compositions.<br>
[0002] Foam control compositions for pulping processes have been known and used for<br>
some time and have been described in a number of publications. A very important type of<br>
such pulping foam control compositions are based on silicone materials. For example<br>
GB1296308, published in 1972, describes antifoam compositions for aqueous systems<br>
which comprise a water insoluble organic liquid, e.g., mineral oil, a siloxane polymer, a filler<br>
and an ingredient which makes the filler compatible with the siloxane polymer. The<br>
compositions are claimed to be useful in the pulp and paper industry. In US 6656975<br>
silicone compositions are described which comprise a continuous phase of a polar organic<br>
liquid having dispersed in it particles of a silicone antifoam material encapsulated within an<br>
organic encapsulating material of certain characteristics. The silicone antifoam is indicated<br>
as comprising a polyorganosiloxane fluid and a hydrophobic filler, where the<br>
polyorganosiloxane fluid is a linear, branched, or cross-linked polydiorganosiloxane having a<br>
silanol level of 0.01-0.05 wt.%. The silicone composition is used for controlling foam in an<br>
aqueous medium, e.g. in the pulp and paper industry. Silicone-based foam control agents<br>
are known, and those using branched polyorganosiloxanes fluids have been described as<br>
being particularly useful for detergent compositions. For example EP 0434060 describes a<br>
silicone antifoaming agent composition, comprising a polydiorganosiloxane, silica and 1 to<br>
200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polydiorganosiloxane and silica<br>
combined, of a cross-linked organopolysiloxane polymer exhibiting fluidity. In GB 2257709,<br>
there is described A method for preparing a silicone foam control agent which comprises the<br>
steps of forming a mixture of a vinyl end-blocked polydiorganosiloxane, a volatile, low<br>
viscosity organohydrogensiloxane, having at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms and a<br><br>
solvent; reacting said mixture in the presence of a noble metal catalyst to make a branched<br>
organopolysiloxane, and adding to the mixture a finely divided particulate material, having a<br>
surface rendered hydrophobic by contact with a treating agent.<br>
[0003] Thus silicone-based or silicone comprising foam control compositions can be<br>
prepared by mixing at least 2 liquid materials which then undergo a chemical reaction in<br>
liquid phase, which is for example a condensation or an addition type reaction, such as<br>
hydrosilylation (also called hydrosilation) or silanol-silyl reaction. A particular material, e.g.<br>
filler is often added, which may be done before or after the reaction. For example, in EP<br>
0217501 there is described a foam control composition comprising (A) a liquid siloxane<br>
component and (B) a finely divided filler having its surface rendered hydrophobic,<br>
characterised in that the liquid siloxane component (A) has a viscosity at 25Â°C of at least 7 x<br>
10-3 m2/s and is obtained by mixing (1) 100 parts by weight of a polydiorganosiloxane<br>
having triorganosiloxy end groups; (2) from 10 to 125 parts by weight of a<br>
polydiorganosiloxane having at least one terminal silanol group and at least 40 Si atoms,<br>
and (3) from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane resin comprising R"3SiO1/2<br>
units and SiO2 units in a ratio of from 0.5:1 to 1.2:1 and in which R" denotes a monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, said resin having on average at<br>
least one silicon-bonded hydroxyl group per molecule and thereafter heating the mixture.<br>
[0004] EP 0 270 273 describes reacting a mixture of components including a<br>
polyorganosiloxane fluid with at least one hydroxyl and/or hydrocarbonoxy group, a resinous<br>
siloxane or a silicone resin-producing silicon compound, a finely divided filler material and a<br>
catalyst to promote the reaction of the components. EP0047630 A describes a composite<br>
anti-foaming agent formed by mixing and reacting an organopolysiloxane oil and/or a<br>
hydrocarbon oil; an organohydrogenpolysiloxane; a finely divided silica; and optionally a<br>
catalyst for the reaction of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms with silicon-bonded hydroxyl<br>
radicals. EP 0 254 499 B describes a silicone defoamer composition obtained from different<br>
polyorganosiloxane components which are first mixed and reacted with heating. A filler is<br>
added before or after the condensation reaction. US 4 741 861 describes a silicone-based<br>
antifoam composition comprising 3 kinds of diorganopolysiloxanes including one terminated<br>
at both molecular chain ends with a vinyl diorganosilyl group and one terminated at both at<br>
both molecular chain ends with a diorganosilyl group having a silicon-bonded hydrogen<br>
atom, a finely divided silica powder an a platinum compound as catalyst. The increase in<br>
molecular weight of the diorganopolysiloxane, which is chosen with relatively low viscosity<br><br>
and may be emulsified in an aqueous medium, is suggested to take place after<br>
emulsification by the addition reaction. EP 0 516 109 B1 describes silicone defoamer<br>
compositions prepared by heating a mixture of components which include a trimethylsiloxy-<br>
terminated dimethylpolysiloxane, a vinyldimethylsiloxy-terminated dimethylpolysiloxane, a<br>
dimethylsiloxane-methylhydrogensiloxane copolymer, a trimethylsiloxysilicate,<br>
microparticulate silica, and platinum catalyst.<br>
[0005] There is constantly a need to provide further improved foam control agents for<br>
aqueous media, such as the paper making and pulp industry, textile dyeing applications and<br>
metal working applications, but in particular for the pulping process, such as the KraftÂ®<br>
pulping process. A preferred process for making suitable foam control compositions<br>
comprising a branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane material in which is dispersed a<br>
finely divided filler, whose surface is hydrophobic, comprises the steps of<br>
a)	mixing (i) a finely divided filler, (ii) a polyorganosiloxane having on average at least<br>
two reactive substituents, capable of addition reaction with component (iii) via<br>
hydrosilylation and (iii) a polyorganosiloxane having at least three reactive<br>
substituents, capable of addition reaction with component (ii) via hydrosilylation,<br>
b)	followed by causing hydrosilylation reaction of components (ii) and (iii) in the<br>
presence of a transition metal catalyst.<br>
[0006] It has now surprisingly been found that if the process for making a foam control<br>
agent which comprises a branched, a lightly, a partially or a fully cross-linked silicone,<br>
preferably polyorganosiloxane, includes both adding a finely divided filler prior to the<br>
formation of the branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane and forming an at least<br>
partially gelled structure or mixture of the branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane to<br>
which shear forces are applied, improved foam control compositions can be obtained.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, in one of its aspects, the present invention provides a process for<br>
making a foam control composition comprising a branched or cross-linked<br>
polyorganosiloxane material in which is dispersed a finely divided filler, whose surface is<br>
hydrophobic, which comprises the steps of<br>
A) mixing prior to step (B) (i) a finely divided filler, (ii) a polyorganosiloxane having at<br>
least two reactive substituents, preferably on average two reactive substituents,<br>
capable of addition reaction with component (iii) via hydrosilylation and (iii) a<br><br>
polyorganosiloxane having at least three reactive substituents, capable of addition<br>
reaction with component (ii) via hydrosilylation;<br>
B) followed by causing hydrosilylation reaction of components (ii) and (iii) in the<br>
presence of a transition metal catalyst<br>
wherein the hydrosilylation reaction is conducted until the reaction mixture gels at least<br>
partially, and shearing forces are applied to this at least partially gelled mixture.<br>
[0008] The finely divided filler (i) to be used in step (A) of the process of the invention is a<br>
finely divided particulate material. It may be any of the known inorganic fillers suitable for<br>
formulating foam control compositions. Such fillers are described in many patent<br>
applications and are commercially available. They include fumed TiO2, AI2O3,<br>
aluminosilicates, zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, salts of aliphatic carboxylic acids,<br>
polyethylene wax, reaction products of isocyanates with certain materials, e.g.<br>
cyclohexylamine, alkyl amides, e.g. ethylene or methylene bis stearamide and SiO2 with a<br>
surface area as measured by BET measurement of at least 50 m2/g. Preferred fillers are<br>
silica fillers which can be made according to any of the standard manufacturing techniques<br>
for example thermal decomposition of a silicon halide, a decomposition and precipitation of a<br>
metal salt of silicic acid, e.g. sodium silicate and a gel formation method. It is preferred that<br>
silica used in a process according to this invention is a precipitated silica or a gel formation<br>
silica, most preferably precipitated silica. The average particle size of these fillers may<br>
range from 0.1 to 20 Âµm but preferably is from 0.5 to 2.0 Âµm.<br>
[0009] The surface of finely divided filler particles is hydrophobic in order to make the foam<br>
control composition sufficiently effective in aqueous systems. Where they are not naturally<br>
hydrophobic, the filler particles must be rendered hydrophobic, which may be done either<br>
prior to or after dispersing the filler particles in step (A) of the process of the invention. This<br>
can be effected by treatment of the filler particles with treating agents, e.g. fatty acids,<br>
reactive silanes or siloxanes, for example stearic acid, dimethyldichlorosilane,<br>
trimethylchlorosilane, hexamethyldisilazane, hydroxy-endblocked and methyl-endblocked<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes and siloxane resins. Fillers which have already been treated with<br>
such compounds are commercially available from many companies, for example SipernatÂ®<br>
D10 from Degussa. The surface of the filler may alternatively be rendered hydrophobic in<br>
situ, i.e. after the filler has been dispersed in the liquid siloxane component. This may be<br>
effected by adding to the liquid siloxane component prior to, during or after the dispersion of<br>
the filler e.g. during step (A) of the process of invention, the appropriate amount of a treating<br><br>
agent, for example of the kind described above, and causing some reaction to take place, for<br>
example by heating the mixture to a temperature above 40Â°C. The quantity of treating agent<br>
to be employed will depend for example on the nature of the agent and the filler and will be<br>
evident or ascertainable by those skilled in the art. Sufficient should be employed to endow<br>
the filler with at least a discernible degree of hydrophobicity. Preferably, the surface of the<br>
filler is rendered hydrophobic before dispersion in the reagent mixture.<br>
[0010] It is important for the invention that the finely divided filler (i) is added prior to the<br>
hydrosilylation reaction of step (B). Later addition does not provide all the benefits in quality<br>
of the foam control compositions. The filler (i) is added to the foam control agents in an<br>
amount of about 1 to 15, preferably 2 to 5% by weight.<br>
[0011] When manufacturing products, such as foam control compositions according to the<br>
invention, by chemical reaction from fluid or liquid reactants, one usually wants to obtain a<br>
product or material of low to middle viscosity. If the viscosity of the reacting mixture<br>
becomes too high (for example above 60 000 centistokes), the material is more difficult to<br>
handle and/or to emulsify. If the material gels, it may stick to the manufacturing equipment,<br>
resulting in a waste of reactants, loss of production time and production output as well as a<br>
need for extra time and effort for the cleaning of equipment. This is supported, for example,<br>
by EP 0 516 109 B where on pages 3 and 4 it teaches to limit the cross-linking density and<br>
to use low viscosity reactants otherwise "gelation becomes a substantial risk". The applicant<br>
surprisingly found that the reaction mixture can be allowed to gel at last partially and may be<br>
recovered (for example liquefied or redispersed) by applying shear forces. Furthermore, the<br>
compositions then obtained tend to present better antifoam properties than compositions<br>
which have not been allowed to gel, independently of their final viscosity.<br>
[0012] The reactive substituents of components (ii) and (iii) are silicon bonded hydrogen<br>
atoms and silicon-bonded aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon groups where the<br>
unsaturation is between terminal carbon atoms of said group It is not important whether the<br>
silicon-bonded hydrogen groups or the unsaturated groups are on component (ii) or on<br>
component (iii), provided one is predominantly, preferably solely, found on component (ii)<br>
and the other is predominantly, preferably solely, found on component (iii).<br>
[0013] Although component (ii) may comprise some branching or some pending siloxane<br>
units on a predominantly linear backbone, it is most preferred that component (ii) is a linear<br><br>
polyorganosiloxane material. It is particularly preferred that the reactive substituents are<br>
located on the terminal silicon atoms of the polyorganosiloxane. Although it is fo be noted<br>
that having such groups on different silicon atoms in the polymer chain, which chain could be<br>
cyclic or linear, would be expected to work also, it is known that such materials are more<br>
difficult to obtain and are usually more expensive to produce.<br>
[0014] With regard to component (iii) it is not crucial whether this is a linear, branched,<br>
resinous or cyclic polyorganosiloxane material. It is preferred that the reactive groups are<br>
spaced in the polymer in such a way that they are substituted on different silicon atoms,<br>
preferably sufficiently far apart to enable easy reaction with a number of polyorganosiloxane<br>
materials of component (ii).<br>
[0015] It is preferred that the silicon-bonded aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon groups<br>
are alkenyl groups, preferably vinyl or allyl groups, most preferably vinyl groups, The<br>
description which follows will use the option of component (ii) having the aliphatically<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon groups as substituents and component (iii) having the silicon<br>
bonded hydrogen atoms, but it is to be understood that the reverse situation is equally<br>
plausible and effective, and the description should be read as including the alternative option<br>
with the details applicable accordingly.<br>
[0016] The particularly preferred component (ii) which are useful in step (A) of the process<br>
of the invention is a vinyl end-blocked polydiorganosiloxane having the general formula Vi-<br>
[Si(R2)O]n-Si(R2)Vi, wherein R denotes a monovalent organic group and Vi denotes a vinyl<br>
group. The organic group R is preferably a hydrocarbon group of up to 8 carbon atoms,<br>
more preferably an alkyl group or an aryl group, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl or phenyl. It<br>
is particularly preferred that at least 80% of all R groups are methyl groups, most preferably<br>
100%. The value of n, which denotes an integer, is such that the viscosity of the vinyl end-<br>
blocked polydiorganosiloxane is in the range of from 200 to 100,000 mPa.s, more preferably<br>
2000 to 55,000 mPa.s at a temperature of 25Â°C.<br>
[0017] In step (A) of a process according to the invention the component (iii), being a<br>
polyorganosiloxane having silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, also sometimes referred to as<br>
an polyorganohydrogensiloxane, may be cyclic, linear, branched or resinous, or may be a<br>
mixture including two or more of such polyorganohydrogensiloxanes. The viscosity of<br>
component (iii) is such that it is substantially lower than that of component (ii), preferably no<br><br>
more than 1000 mPa.s at 25 Â°C. Suitable cyclic polyorganohydrogensiioxanes include those<br>
of the formula (RR'SiO)x in which R is as defined above and R' is a group R or a hydrogen<br>
atom, provided there are at least three silicon atoms which have a hydrogen atom<br>
substituted thereon, and x is an integer with a value of from 3 to 10. Preferably R is an alkyl<br>
or aryl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms preferably methyl, each R' is hydrogen and x<br>
is an integer from 3 to 5. Suitable linear polyorganohydrogensiioxanes for use as<br>
component (iii) include those of the general formula R'3SiO(RR'SiO)ySiR'3 where R and R'<br>
are the same as defined above and y is from 2 to 300, preferably 2 to 40, more preferably 3<br>
to 25, provided there are at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule Resinous<br>
or branched polyorganohydrogensiloxane materials for use as component (iii) have a three<br>
dimensional structure and may include monovalent (R'3SiO1/2) units, divalent (R'2SiO2/2)<br>
units, trivalent (R'SiO3/2) units and/or tetravalent (SiO4/2) units, wherein R' has the same<br>
meaning as identified above, provided there are at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen groups<br>
per molecule. The preferred resinous polyorganohydrogensiloxane materials for use as<br>
component (iii) have a molecular weight of no more than 15,000. It is particularly preferred<br>
that component (iii) has from 3 to 10, most preferred 3 to 5 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms<br>
per molecule, with each hydrogen atom being substituted on a different silicon atom<br>
[0018] As indicated above, components (ii) and (iii) may be having Si-H and the preferred<br>
Si-alkenyl functionality respectively, instead of the ones specifically described above. In<br>
such case, component (ii) may be a polyorganohydrogensiloxane, preferably a<br>
polydialkylsiloxane having terminal Si-H groups, for example a polydimethylsiloxane having<br>
terminal dimethylhydrogensiloxane units and a viscosity at 25Â°C of from 200 to 100,000<br>
preferably from 2000 to 55,000 mPa.s. Additionally, component (iii) could be for example a<br>
resinous material having mono-functional units (R"3SiO1/2), difunctional units (R"2SiO2/2),<br>
trifunctional units (R"2SiO3/2) and tetrafunctional units (SiO4/2) wherein R" denotes a group<br>
R or a monovalent unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group. Some OH groups may also be<br>
substituted onto some silicon atoms. A particularly preferred resinous material would be a<br>
vinyl substituted siloxane resin having mainly monofunctional and tetrafunctional units, a<br>
molecular weight of about 5,000 and an average of 3 to 5 vinyl units substituted on different<br>
silicon atoms.<br>
[0019] It is important that the ratio of components (ii) and (iii) are carefully selected so that<br>
the hydrosilylation reaction is well conducted and controlled. By choosing the right level of<br>
reactive groups of each type, the cross-linking or branching density can be controlled and<br><br>
pre-determined. In addition, using excess of one functional group, preferably the<br>
aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon group, the amount of unreacted groups in the final<br>
branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane can be controlled. This is particularly important<br>
where the presence of unreacted SiH groups is to be minimised for example for safety<br>
reasons. Preferably the ratio of the number of SiH groups to aliphatically unsaturated Si-<br>
bonded hydrocarbon groups is in the range of from 1/10 to 10/1, more preferably the ratio<br>
will be from 1/3 to 3/1, most preferably 1/2 to 1/1.<br>
[0020] During step (B), components (ii) and (iii) are caused to react by hydrosilylation<br>
reaction in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The transition metal catalyst for use in<br>
step (B) of the process of the invention catalyses the hydrosilylation reaction and may be<br>
selected from a variety of hydrosilylation catalysts known to promote the reaction of vinyl-<br>
functional radicals with silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms. Suitable transition metal catalysts<br>
include platinum and rhodium-containing compounds and complexes. Platinum catalysts<br>
such as platinum acetylacetonate or chloroplatinic acid are representative of these<br>
compounds and suitable for use. A preferred transition metal catalyst is a chloroplatinic acid<br>
complex of divinyltetramethyldisiloxane diluted in dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked<br>
polydimethylsiloxane which may be prepared according to methods described by Willing in<br>
U.S. patent No. 3,419,593. Most preferably this mixture contains about 0.6 weight percent<br>
platinum.<br>
[0021] It is possible to include the transition metal catalyst at the same time as<br>
components (i) to (iii), but if this is done, it is preferred that a method is used of halting the<br>
activity of the catalyst till the process is ready to proceed. Such options include the use of<br>
an inhibitor, which is discussed below and the use of physical separation, such as<br>
encapsulation, which is undone immediately prior to starting step (B) of the process<br>
according to the invention. Alternatively, and more preferably, the transition metal catalyst is<br>
added in immediately prior to starting step (B) of the process of the invention, which may be<br>
done by any known means, and will require some efficient dispersion of the catalyst into the<br>
mixture. It is particularly preferred to prepare the mixture of step (A) and bring it to the right<br>
temperature to enable the hydrosilylation reaction to occur, at which stage the catalyst<br>
either neat or in diluted form (for example in a small portion of component (ii) or (iii),<br>
preferably the component having the aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon substituents or in<br>
a small portion of a diluent or solvent as discussed below) is introduced and mixed to cause<br>
good dispersion in the mixture. Reaction would then proceed immediately.<br><br>
[0022] Hydrosilylation catalysts which are useful as transition metal catalysts for use in<br>
step (B) of the process according to the invention are well known in the art and the<br>
interested reader is referred to the following patents for detailed descriptions regarding their<br>
preparation and use: Speier, U.S. Patent No. 2,823,218; Willing, U.S. Patent No. 3,419,359;<br>
Kookootsedes, U.S. Patent No. 3,445,420; Polmanteer et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,697,473;<br>
Nitzsche, U.S. Patent No. 3,814,731; Chandra, U.S. Patent No. 3,890,359 and Sandford,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,123,604. Many of the catalysts known in the art require the reactants to<br>
be heated in order for a reaction to occur. When such catalysts are employed this<br>
requirement must be taken into consideration.<br>
[0023] In its simplest terms, the hydrosilylation reaction for forming the branched or cross-<br>
linked polyorganosiloxane using the preferred components (ii) and (iii), which is a three<br>
dimensional polymer network, in step (B) of the process of the present invention can be<br>
characterised as:<br><br>
The reaction may be carried out in any convenient way but we prefer to blend the vinyl<br>
endblocked polydiorganosiloxane, polyorganohydrogensiloxane, optionally a solvent or<br>
diluent and bring that blended mixture up to the required reaction temperature, at which time<br>
the transition metal catalyst is added to enable the reaction. The hydrosilylation reaction<br>
may occur at ambient temperature, but is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 30<br>
to 100Â°C, more preferably about 70Â°C.<br>
[0024] Preferably, where component (ii) is the aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon group<br>
containing polyorganosiloxane, e.g. the vinyl end-blocked polydiorganosiloxane, it is<br>
included in the reactant solution in an amount of up to 98%, preferably 80 to 92% by weight<br>
based on the weight of components (i), (ii) and (iii) combined in step (A). On the same<br>
basis, the amount of finely divided filler (i) would be added in the range of 2 to 15% by<br>
weight and the amount of component (iii) would be in the range of 0.1 to 5% by weight based<br>
on the total weight of components (i), (ii) and (iii). The optimal amount will be determined to<br>
some extent on the choice of the other ingredients, the amount of cross-linking which is<br>
desired and the final viscosity of the foam control composition which is aimed at, and some<br>
routine experimentation may be necessary to reach the optimum combination. It is therefore<br>
particularly useful to select the amount of such components carefully. The presence of<br><br>
optional ingredients may of course affect the absolute amounts and the relative amounts of<br>
each of these ingredients used.<br>
[0025] The concentrations of transition metal catalyst and optional inhibitor to be used in<br>
the present invention may be determined by routine experimentation. Typically, the effective<br>
amount of catalyst should be in a range so as to provide from 0.1 to 1000 parts per million<br>
(ppm) of the actual metal (e.g. platinum) by weight based on the weight of components (ii)<br>
and (iii) combined in the mixture used in step (B) of the process according to the present<br>
invention. As an example, when the preferred catalyst mixture (i.e. the chloroplatinic acid<br>
complex of divinyltetramethyldisiloxane containing about 0.6% by weight of platinum) and<br>
inhibitor (i.e. bis(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)maleate) are employed, a ratio by weight of<br>
inhibitor to catalyst mixture ranging from zero to about 0.6 provides a suitably wide range of<br>
inhibition which is adequate under most practical conditions of manufacture.<br>
[0026] The branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane prepared in step (B) of the<br>
process according to the present invention has a three dimensional network and preferably<br>
is such that the final foam control composition has a viscosity of from 20,000 to 100,000<br>
mPa.s measured at 25Â°C, more preferably from 40,000 to 75,000 mPa.s. For purposes of<br>
foam control compositions according to the present invention, the branched or cross-linked<br>
polyorganosiloxane itself could have a viscosity of from 20,000 to several million mPa.s at<br>
25Â°C. It is preferred that the cross-linking density of the resulting polyorganosiloxane is as<br>
high as possible as that provides better performance in the foam control applications. In<br>
order to handle these materials, the amount of solvent or diluent is to be selected such that<br>
the final viscosity of the foam control composition is as desired.<br>
[0027] In step (A) of the process according to the invention it is optional to include chain<br>
extenders. There are materials similar to component (ii), and especially the preferred type of<br>
component (ii), being a substantially linear polyorganosiloxane material where the active<br>
group is present at the terminal silicon atoms of the siloxane. These materials will perform<br>
the role of taking part in the hydrosilylation reaction, but with the effect of spacing out the<br>
places where the final polyorganosiloxane is branched. It is therefore suggested that the<br>
reactive group of the chain extender is the same as the reactive group of component (iii).<br>
Examples of suitable chain extenders would be a,aj-divinyl polydimethylsiloxane, it<br>
component (iii) is using the aliphatically unsaturated hydrocarbon reactive groups<br><br>
[0028] In step (A) of the process according to the invention it is optional, but preferred that<br>
a solvent or diluent is employed which is preferably a polydiorganosiloxane. Suitable<br>
polydiorganosiloxane solvents or diluents are substantially linear or cyclic polymers,<br>
although mixtures thereof can also be used, wherein the silicon-bonded substituents are<br>
groups R, as defined above. Most preferably at least 80% of all silicon-bonded substituents<br>
are alkyl groups, preferably methyl groups. Most preferred solvents or diluents include<br>
trimethylsiloxy end-blocked polydimethylsiloxanes having a viscosity of from 500 to 12,500<br>
mPa.s, more preferably 500 to 5000 mPa.s measured at 25Â°C The solvents or diluents are<br>
mainly present to solubilise the branched or cross-linked polyorganosiloxane made in step<br>
(B) of the process of the invention, which is particularly useful for the higher viscosity<br>
branched or cross-linked polydiorganosiloxanes.<br>
[0029] The amount of solvent or diluent which can be used may vary widely, and it is<br>
preferred that larger amounts of solvent or diluent are used where the branched or cross<br>
linked polyorganosiloxane has itself a higher viscosity. The amounts of solvent or diluent<br>
used could be as high as 90% by weight based on the total formulation of the foam control<br>
composition, but preferably from 50 to 80 % is used. It is most appropriate to determine the<br>
amount and type, including viscosity, of solvent or diluent used by trial and error based on<br>
the desired viscosity of the final foam control composition. The latter may vary widely, and is<br>
often determined by the application in which it is to be used, but it is preferably in the range<br>
from 20,000 to 100,000 mPa.s at 25Â°C, more preferably from 40,000 to 75,000 mPa.s.<br>
[0030] When transition metal catalysts such as platinum catalysts are used in step (B) of<br>
the process of the invention an inhibitor may be desirable in order to improve the shelf life of<br>
the starting materials or to control the viscosity-time profile of the final foam control<br>
compositions. These inhibitors are also known in the art and include ethylenically<br>
unsaturated isocyanurates, such as trialkylisocyanurate, dialkylacetylenedicarboxylates,<br>
alkyl maleates, di-allylmaleate, phosphine, phosphites, aminoalkyl silanes, sulphoxides,<br>
acrylonitrile derivatives and acetylenic alcohols such as 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol and others.<br>
Particular inhibitors preferably used are diethyl fumarate, bis(2-methoxy-1-<br>
methylene)maleate, bis(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)maleate and 1-ethynyl-1-cyclohexanol. All<br>
of these materials are well known in the art and are commercially available products The<br>
amount of inhibitor which could be used in the foam control composition may vary from<br>
0.001 to 2% by weight based on the total weight of the foam control composition, but more<br>
preferably would be in the range of 0.005 to 0.5% by weight. Selection of appropriate<br><br>
inhibitors will also depend on the end use of the foam control agent, as some of the named<br>
inhibitors are not acceptable for food contact purposes.<br>
[0031] Upon completion of step (B) of the process according to the invention, it may be<br>
possible to use the foam control agent in any suitable form, including as a neat component<br>
as obtained from step (B), in diluted form, in the form of a dispersion, in the form of an<br>
emulsion or in the form of a granule. The neat foam control composition is often a relatively<br>
viscous liquid. At least partial gelation of the reaction mixture will have occurred during step<br>
(B). A gelled material is jelly-like, with a physical state intermediate between solid and liquid<br>
state, usually flowable under pressure, but not freely flowing under atmospheric pressure.<br>
Where the material is not sufficiently flowable, such as obtained after the at least partial<br>
gelation, shearing forces are to be applied, for example through thorough stirring or by<br>
passing the material through a homogenizer or other mixer to improve its flowability The<br>
improvement in flowability can be achieved by dispersing, redispersing or liquefying the<br>
material through application of the shearing forces. This may be done prior to use of the<br>
neat material or prior to further manipulation to provide it in another suitable form, such as a<br>
emulsion. A certain amount of flowability of the foam control compositions according to the<br>
invention is important for the foam control compositions to work effectively in a liquid or liquid<br>
containing environment.<br>
[0032] For most applications, it is preferred that the foam control composition is emulsified,<br>
as this helps with dosing and dispersion of the foam control composition in its final<br>
application. Emulsions may be obtained by standard (mechanical) emulsification processes<br>
in a subsequent step in the process according to the invention. Alternatively emulsification<br>
may be obtained by forming an emulsion during step (A), followed by the cross-linking<br>
reaction of step (B) being carried out in the emulsion particles. Such process is often<br>
referred to as emulsion polymerisation process. Suitable surfactants for the emulsification of<br>
foam control agents are well known and have been described in a number of publications.<br>
In typical emulsions, the continuous phase is preferably water, but some alternative or<br>
additional materials may be used, which are compatible with water, such as alcohols or<br>
polyoalkylenes. Preferably the continuous phase is predominantly water and is present in<br>
amounts from 30 to 95% by weight of the total weight of the emulsified foam control<br>
composition. The components (i), (ii). and (iii) would normally provide from 5 to 50% by<br>
weight of such an emulsion and the surfactants would represent from 1 to 20% by weight<br><br>
[0033] Suitable surfactants may comprise a nonionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, an<br>
anionic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant, or a mixture of such surfactants. Preferably the<br>
nonionic surfactants are used. They could be a silicon-atom-containing nonionic, emulsifier,<br>
but for the emulsification mostly non-silicon containing nonionic emulsifier are used<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants include sorbitan fatty esters, ethoxylated sorbitan tatty esters,<br>
glyceryl esters, fatty acid ethoxylates, alcohol ethoxylates R3-(OCH2CH2)aOH, particularly<br>
fatty alcohol ethoxylates and organosiloxane polyoxyethylene copolymers. Fatty alcohol<br>
ethoxylates typically contain the characteristic group -(OCH2CH2)aOH which is attached to<br>
a monovalent fatty hydrocarbon residue R3 which contains about eight to about twenty<br>
carbon atoms, such as lauryl (C12), cetyl (C16) and stearyl (C18). While the value or "a"<br>
may range from 1 to about 100, its value is typically in the range of about 2 to about 40,<br>
preferably 2 to 24. It is sometimes helpful to use a combination of surfactants to aid the<br>
emulsification.<br>
[0034] Some examples of suitable nonionic surfactants are polyoxyethylene (4) lauryl<br>
ether, polyoxyethylene (5) lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene (2)<br>
cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (10) cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (20) cetyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (10) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (20)<br>
stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (21) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (100) stearyl ether,<br>
polyoxyethylene (2) oleyl ether, and polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether. These and other fatty<br>
alcohol ethoxylates are commercially available under trademarks and tradenames such as<br>
ALFONICO, BRIJ, GENAPOL (S), NEODOL, SURFONIC, TERGITOL and TRYCOL<br>
Ethoxylated alkylphenols can also be used, such as ethoxylated octylphenol, sold under the<br>
trademark TRITONS.<br>
[0035] Cationic surfactants useful in the invention include compounds containing<br>
quaternary ammonium hydrophilic moieties in the molecule which are positively charged,<br>
such as quaternary ammonium salts represented by R44N+X_ where each R4 are<br>
independently alkyl groups containing 1-30 carbon atoms, or alkyl groups derived from<br>
tallow, coconut oil, or soy ; and X is halogen, i. e. chlorine or bromine. Most preferred are<br>
dialkyldimethyl ammonium salts represented by R52N+ (CH3)2X-, where each R5 is an alkyl<br>
group containing 12-30 carbon atoms, or alkyl groups derived from tallow, coconut oil, or soy<br>
and X is as defined above. Monoalkyltrimethyl ammonium salts can also be employed, and<br>
are represented by R5N+(CH3)3X- where R5 and X are as defined above.<br><br>
[0036] Some representative quaternary ammonium salts are dodecyltrimethyl ammonium<br>
bromide (DTAB), didodecyldimethyl ammonium bromide, dihexadecyldimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride, dihexadecyldimethyl ammonium bromide, dioctadecyldimethyl ammonium chloride,<br>
dieicosyldimethyl ammonium chloride, didocosyldimethyl ammonium chloride,<br>
dicoconutdimethyl ammonium chloride, ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride, and<br>
ditallowdimethyl ammonium bromide. These and other quaternary ammonium salts are<br>
commercially available under tradenames such as ADOGEN, ARQUAD, TOMAH and<br>
VARIQUAT.<br>
[0037] Among the various types of anionic surfactants which can be used are sulfonic<br>
acids and their salt derivatives; alkali metal sulfosuccinates , sulfonate glyceryl esters of fatty<br>
acids such as sulfonate monoglycerides of coconut oil acids; salts of sulfonate monovalent<br>
alcohol esters such as sodium oleyl isothionate; amides of amino sulfonic acids such as the<br>
sodium salt of oleyl methyl tauride; sulfonate products of fatty acid nitriles such as<br>
palmitonitrile sulfonate ; sulfonate aromatic hydrocarbons such as sodium alphanaphthalene<br>
monosulfonate ; condensation products of naphthalene sulfonic acids with formaldehyde ;<br>
sodium octahydro anthracene sulfonate ; alkali metal alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl<br>
(dodecyl) sulfate (SDS); ether sulfates having alkyl groups of eight or more carbon atoms;<br>
and alkylaryl sulfonates having one or more alkyl groups of eight or more carbon atoms.<br>
[0038] Some examples of commercial anionic surfactants useful in this invention include<br>
triethanolamine linear alkyl sulfonate sold under the tradename BIO-SOFT N-300 by the<br>
Stepan Company.Northfield, Illinois; sulfates sold under the tradename POLYSTEP by the<br>
Stepan Company; and sodium n-hexadecyl diphenyloxide disulfonate sold under the<br>
tradename DOWFAX 8390 by The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan.<br>
[0039] Amphoteric surfactants can also be used which generally comprise surfactant<br>
compositions such as alkyl betaines, alkylamido betaines, and amine oxides, specific<br>
examples of which are known in the art.<br>
[0040] Optional ingredients may also be included in the emulsions of foam control<br>
compositions according to the invention. These are well known in the art and include for<br>
example thickeners, preservatives, pH stabilisers etc. Suitable examples of thickeners<br>
include sodium alginate, gum arabic, polyoxyethylene, guar gum, hydroxypropyl guar gum,<br><br>
ethoxylated alcohols, such as laureth-4 or polyethylene glycol 400, cellulose derivatives<br>
exemplified by methylcellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
polypropylhydroxyethylcellulose, starch, and starch derivatives exemplified by<br>
hydroxyethylamylose and starch amylose, locust bean gum, electrolytes exemplified by<br>
sodium chloride and ammonium chloride, and saccharides such as fructose and glucose,<br>
and derivatives of saccharides such as PEG-120 methyl glucose diolate or mixtures of 2 or<br>
more of these and acrylic polymer thickeners (e.g. those sold under the tradenames<br>
PEMULEN and CARBOPOL). Suitable preservatives include the parabens, BHT, BHA and<br>
other well known ingredients such as isothiazoline or mixtures of organic acids like benzoic<br>
acid and sorbic acid.<br>
[0041] Where emulsification is intended, it is preferred to introduce another optional<br>
ingredient. This may be included with the ingredients in step (A) of the process according to<br>
the invention or may be added immediately prior to the emulsification process. This optional<br>
ingredient is a silicone resin having monofunctional (M) and tetrafunctional (Q) units and<br>
optionally difunctional (D) and/or trifunctional (T) units. The silicone resin may be tor-<br>
example an organosilicon compound with the average units of the general formula R6dSiX4-<br>
d in which R6 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, X is a<br>
hydrolyzable group and d has an average value of one or less. Alternatively it may be a<br>
partially hydrolyzed condensate of the organosilicon compound described immediately<br>
above. Examples are alkyl polysilicate wherein the alkyl group has one to five carbon<br>
atoms, such as methyl polysilicate, ethyl polysilicate and propyl polysilicate.<br>
[0042] Preferably it is a resin which only has M and Q units and is also known as MQ resin.<br>
The preferred MQ resins are those consisting essentially of (CH3)3SiO1/2 units and SiO4/2<br>
units wherein the ratio of (CH3)3SiO1/2 units to SiO4/2 units is from 0.4:1 to 1.2:1 or a<br>
condensate of said MQ resin with the organosilicon compound described above. These<br>
silicone resins have been known and described in a number of publications and are<br>
commercially available. The preferred examples of a suitable MQ resin is a siloxane resin<br>
copolymer consisting essentially of (CH3)3SiO1/2 units and SiO2 units in a molar ratio of<br>
approximately 0.75:1.<br>
[0043] The main benefit for the use of the silicone resin is that it has surprisingly been<br>
found that the use of small amounts of such resin substantially facilitates the emulsification<br><br>
of the foam control compositions according to this invention. Indeed addition of as little as<br>
up to 0.5% of a silicone resin by weight, based on the weight of the foam control composition<br>
will enable foam control agents with high viscosity or high molecular weight branched or<br>
cross-linked polyorganosiloxanes to be readily emulsified by mechanical means, which<br>
would otherwise be extremely difficult. Also it was found that the addition of such small<br>
amounts of silicone resin provides emulsions with smaller particle size for identical<br>
emulsification processes. This of course will lead to greater stability of the emulsion Larger<br>
amounts than 0.5% may also be added, but do not provide any further benefit to the<br>
emulsification step of the process according to the invention.<br>
[0044] Alternative ways of providing the foam control compositions according to the<br>
invention include dispersions thereof. For example US 6656975 describes a silicone<br>
composition comprising a continuous phase of a polar organic liquid having dispersed<br>
therein particles of a silicone active material (such as a silicone antifoam) encapsulated<br>
within an organic encapsulating material which is solid at 25Â°C, is sparingly soluble in the<br>
polar organic liquid at 25Â°C but is substantially dissolved in the polar organic liquid at an<br>
elevated temperature in the range 40-100Â°C, wherein the three phase contact angle<br>
between the organic encapsulating material, the silicone antifoam, and the polar organic<br>
liquid, with the angle measured through the silicone, is below 130Â°. The disclosure includes<br>
a foam control composition comprising a continuous phase of a polar organic liquid having<br>
dispersed therein a polyorganosiloxane fluid combined with a surfactant of HLB below 8 and<br>
a hydrophobic silicaceous material. Particular examples of suitable polar organic liquids<br>
include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols and copolymers of<br>
polyethers, such as materials sold under the tradenames of PluriolÂ® and PluronicÂ®<br>
Polyorganosiloxane oxypolyalkylene copolymers may also be added to help render the<br>
dispersions self-emulsifiable in aqueous media.<br>
[0045] Yet another suitable approach to deliver the foam control compositions according<br>
to the present invention is by providing them in particulate or granular form. Particulate foam<br>
control compositions often contain a carrier material for the foam control agent to make the<br>
foam control composition into a more substantial solid particulate material and facilitate its<br>
handling. The particulate foam control compositions are used for example by post-blending<br>
them as a powder with the rest of a powder detergent composition. Materials that have been<br>
suggested as carrier materials for particulate silicone based foam control compositions<br>
include water soluble, water insoluble and water dispersible materials. Examples oi<br><br>
suggested carrier materials are sulphates, carbonates, such as for example soda ash,<br>
phosphates, polyphosphates, silicas, silicates, clays, starches, cellulosic materials and<br>
aluminosilicates. Often, the encapsulating or protective materials are used in combination<br>
with the carrier material.<br>
[0046] A foam control composition comprising an encapsulating or protective material is<br>
known from EP636684, which comprises from 1 to 30 parts by weight of a silicone antifoam,<br>
from 70 to 99 parts by weight of a zeolite carrier for the antifoam, from 1 to 60% by weight of<br>
the silicone antifoam of a surface active agent which has been deposited on the zeolite<br>
carrier not later than the silicone antifoam and from 1 to 40 parts by weight of a<br>
polycarboxylate-type binder or encapsulant. In US patent 6165968, there is disclosed that<br>
such polycarboxylate-type binder preferably has a pH of 3 or less when dissolved in water.<br>
Processes for making foam control compositions in granular form are known from these and<br>
other documents, include spray drying, agglomerated granulation processes and the like and<br>
can be applied to the foam control compositions of this invention to provide the particulate or<br>
granular material for use in many applications, such a powder detergent formulations<br>
[0047] It has been found that the foam control compositions of the present invention offer<br>
particular advantage when the foaming system comprises highly acid or highly basic<br>
aqueous environments, such as those having a pH of less than about 3 or greater than<br>
about 12. This holds particularly for highly acidic or basic systems at elevated temperatures<br>
Thus, for example, under the extremely harsh conditions encountered in paper pulp<br>
manufacture, wherein the aqueous foaming medium (KraftÂ® process "black liquor") has a pH<br>
of 12 to 14 and a temperature of 50Â°C to 100Â°C, the foam control compositions of the<br>
present invention have been found to provide defoaming activity for considerably greater<br>
time periods than antifoam agents of the prior art. They also tend to provide a good<br>
antifoaming effect in that they knock down existing foam effectively.<br>
[0048] The foam control compositions of the present invention can be used as any kind of<br>
foam control compositions, i.e. as defoaming agents and/or antifoaming agents. Defoaming<br>
agents are generally considered as foam reducers whereas antifoaming agents are<br>
generally considered as foam preventors. The foam control compositions of the present<br>
invention find utility in various media such as inks, coatings, paints, detergents, including<br>
textile washing, laundry and auto dish washing, black liquor, and pulp and paper<br>
manufacture, waste water treatment, textile dyeing processes, the scrubbing of natural gas.<br><br>
[0049] In the following examples foam control agents have been prepared to exemplify the<br>
invention. They are to be seen as representative, but not restrictive of the invention AH<br>
parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise defined and all viscosities are<br>
5 dynamic viscosities, measured at 25Â°C, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0050] In a beaker were mixed 20 parts of a mixture of 52% vinyl functional resinous<br>
polyorganosiloxane having a molecular weight of about 13,000 in a mixture of trimethyl<br>
siloxy and vinyldimethyl siloxy end-groups and 48% vinyldimethyl end-blocked polydimethyl<br>
siloxane with an average degree of polymerisation (DP) of 14, 580 parts of a<br>
dimethylhydrogen end-blocked polydimethyl siioxane with a viscosity of 13,000 mPa.s with<br>
125 parts of Sipermal D10 from Degussa and as a diluent there was added 2366 parts of<br>
trimethyl end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s and 31 parts<br>
of a resinous polyorganosiloxane having a molecular weight of about 13,000 and having<br>
trimethyl siloxy end-groups. The ratio of Si-vinyl groups to Si-hydrogen atoms was 0 65.<br>
The components were mixed in a HauschildÂ® Dental mixer for 100 seconds. After the<br>
mixture was found to be well dispersed at ambient temperature, at which time 3 parts by<br>
weight of a catalyst which was a chloroplatinic acid complex of divinyltetramethyldisiloxane<br>
diluted in 70% by weight of dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane which may<br>
be prepared according to methods described by Willing in U.S. patent No. 3,419,593 were<br>
added and mixed in. The mixture was allowed to react over a period of 24 hours at room<br>
temperature, at which time 10 parts of diallyl maleate were added by admixture and<br>
homogenisation. After reaction, a homogeneous, viscous liquid was obtained which was<br>
used as such. The final viscosity of the foam control composition was 44,600 mPa.s at<br>
25Â°C<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0051] A foam control composition was prepared along the tines of Example 1, except that<br>
instead of 580 parts of the dimethylhydrogen end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane with a<br>
viscosity of 13,000 mPa.s, only 434 parts were used, instead of the 20 parts of the mixture of<br>
52% vinyl functional resinous polyorganosiloxane having a molecular weight of about 13,000<br>
and a mixture or trimethyl siloxy and vinyldimethyl siloxy end-groups and 48% vinyldimethyl<br><br>
end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane with an average DP of 14, only 0.16 parts were used, and<br>
instead of the 2366 parts of the trimethyl end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a<br>
viscosity of 1000 mPa.s, 2516 parts were used. After reaction, a gelled-up mixture was<br>
obtained which stuck to the manufacturing equipment and could not be handled or<br>
emulsified as such. It was then mixed with shear and the gel turned into a viscous liquid.<br>
The ratio of silicon-bonded vinyl groups to silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms was 0 7 and the<br>
final viscosity was 35000 mPa.s.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0052] The foam control compositions of Comparative Example 1 and Example 2 were<br>
then emulsified, using the following process.<br>
105 parts of the foam control compositions of Comparative Example 1 and Example 2 were<br>
each placed in a separate receptacle, which was heated to 70Â°C. A mixture of 9 3 parts of<br>
Volpo S2 and 9.3 parts of Brij 78 surfactants was preheated to 60Â°C and mixed in with the<br>
compositions. 45 parts of a mixture of 0.76 parts of Keltrol RD, 2.32 parts of Natrosol<br>
250LR, 0.16 parts of sorbic acid, 0.32 parts of benzoic acid, 0.77 parts of a 10% solution of<br>
sulphuric acid and 95.66 parts of water were added and after thorough mixing, another 112<br>
parts of the mixture were added and mixed in. Then 219.5 parts of water were added also,<br>
resulting in an emulsion of the foam control compositions of Comparative Example 1 and<br>
Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0053] The emulsified foam control compositions of Example 3 were tested in a foam cell<br>
using on softwood liquor. To this effect 600 ml of softwood is preheated at 90Â°C and<br>
introduced in a graduated and thermostatically controlled glass cylinder having an inner<br>
diameter of 5 cm This foamable liquid was circulated through a circulation pipe at a<br>
temperature adjusted to 89Â°C. The circulation flow rate is controlled using a MDR Johnson<br>
pump set up at a frequency of 50 Hz. When the foam height of 30 cm is reached, 150 Âµl of<br>
emulsion of the tested foam control composition is injected in the liquid jet. The evolution of<br>
the foam height was monitored and recorded. The foam height was measured in cm over a<br>
sufficient period to allow the foam control composition to have exhausted its capacity, which<br>
is when the foam height of 29cm has been reached again in the foam cell, and the time at<br>
which this occurred was measured as it indicates the longevity of the foam control<br><br>
composition. The first time overflow is mentioned below, the time (in seconds) when first<br>
overflow occurred is given in the table.<br>
[0054] The results were as shown in Table 1:<br><br>
[0055] As can be seen on table above, the composition of Example 2, showed an<br>
improved persistency as compared to composition of Comparative Example 1, showing that<br>
a more highly cross-linked polyorganosiloxane material (resulting from a greater Si-vinyl/Si-H<br>
ratio) does improve foam controlling ability.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0056] A foam control composition (Comparative Example 5a) was prepared by mixing<br>
1820 parts of a trimethyl siloxane end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of<br>
1000 mPa.s, 834 parts of a dimethylvinylsiloxane end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having<br><br>
a viscosity of 9000 mPa.s, 140 parts of a 31 % mixture of resinous polyorganoslloxane<br>
having a molecular weight of about 13,000 and trimethyl siloxy end-groups and 69% of a<br>
trimethyl end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s, 7 5 parts of a<br>
trimethylsiloxane end-blocked copolymer of dimethylsiloxane units and<br>
methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a viscosity of about 7 mPa.s and 0.3% of SiH groups<br>
and 3.5 parts of the catalyst used in Example 1 was mixed in and the mixture left to react<br>
under agitation at a temperature of 40Â°C for 2.5 hours. The resulting gelled mixture was<br>
homogenised under shear forces before 1.1 parts of diallyl maleate and 12 parts of Sipernat<br>
D10 silica were dispersed into the compound. The resulting Comparative Example 5 had a<br>
viscosity of 80,600 mPa.s.<br>
[0057] A similar foam control composition (Comparative Example 5b) was carried out using<br>
a different silica filler (Sipernat D17, which has a larger average particle size, a larger<br>
specific surface area, and is made hydrophobic via a different treatment). The viscosity of<br>
the final material was 50,800mPa.s.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0058] A foam control composition (6a) was prepared by mixing 193.9 parts of a trimethyl<br>
siloxane end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s, 88.8 parts of a<br>
dimethylvinylsiloxane end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 9000 mPa.s,<br>
15.2 parts of a 31% mixture of resinous polyorganosiloxane having a molecular weight of<br>
about 13,000 and trimethyl siloxy end-groups and 69% of a trimethyl end-blocked<br>
polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s, 0.8 parts of a trimethylsiloxane end-<br>
blocked copolymer of dimethylsiloxane units and methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a<br>
viscosity of about 7 mPa.s and 0.3% of SiH groups and 0.34 parts of the catalyst used in<br>
Example 1 and 1.24 parts of Sipernat D10 was mixed in and the mixture left to react under<br>
agitation at a temperature of 40Â°C for 2.5 hours. The resulting gelled mixture was<br>
homogenised under shear forces before 0.11 parts of diallyl maleate were dispersed into the<br>
compound. The resulting Example 6a had a viscosity of 59,600 mPa.s.<br>
[0059] A similar foam control composition (Example 6b) was carried out using a different<br>
silica filler (Sipernat D17, which has a larger average particle size, a larger specific surface<br>
area, and is made hydrophobic via a different treatment). The viscosity of the final material<br>
was 49,200mPa.s.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
[0060] The foam control compositions of Examples 5 and 6 were tested in the foam ceil in<br>
softwood black liquor, as detailed in Example 4 above. The results are provided in Table 2<br>
below. Again the first time overflow occurred is given in seconds after the firs mention of<br>
overflow in the table below.<br>
[0061] Table 2: foam height in function of time<br><br>
[0062] It is observed that the foam control composition which is according to the invention<br>
has an excellent persistency while all the other shows only a moderate persistency (time for<br>
the foam level to reach the maximum). Adding silica after reaction gives lower persistency<br>
compositions.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0063] Foam control compositions were prepared using the ingredients of Example 6<br>
except that the mixture of 31% resinous polyorganosiloxane and 69% of a trimethyl end-<br><br>
blocked polydimethyl siloxane was omitted and that the trimethylsiloxane end-blocked<br>
copolymer of dimethylsiloxane units and methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a viscosity of<br>
about 7 mPa.s was replaced in Example 8a by a trimethylsiloxane end-blocked copolymer of<br>
dimethylsiloxane units and methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a DP of 100 and having<br>
6% of the silicon atoms bearing a hydrogen substituent, in Example 8b with a resinous<br>
material having silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms, in Example 8c with a trimethylsiloxane end<br>
blocked copolymer of dimethylsiloxane units and methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a DP<br>
of 33 of which six silicon atoms had a hydrogen substituent and in Example 8d with another<br>
SiH containing silicon resin and that the hydrosilylation reaction was carried out at 60Â°C for 3<br>
hours and that the Si-vinyl over SiH ratio was 2.1/1 in the cases of Examples 8a, 8c and 8d.<br>
In Example 8b, the reaction was carried out at 37Â°C for 2.5 hours and the SiVi/SiH ratio was<br>
1.3/1. After application of shear, viscosities of the resulting foam control compositions were<br>
respectively 52,400, 41,600, 48,600 and 56,000mPa.s. In all cases did the foam control<br>
composition provide excellent ability to control the foam in the black liquor experiment<br>
described in Example 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
[0064] Foam control compositions were prepared according to Example 6, using 12.5 parts<br>
of the Sipernat D10, 150 parts of the dimethylvinylsiloxane end-blocked polydimethyl<br>
siloxane having a viscosity of 9000 mPa.s, with 0.8 parts of trimethylsiloxane end-blocked<br>
copolymer of dimethylsiloxane units and methylhydrogensiloxane units, having a viscosity of<br>
about 7 mPa.s, with 148.9 parts of the combination of the resinous polyorganosiloxane<br>
having a molecular weight of about 13,000 and trimethyl siloxy end-groups and trimethyl<br>
end-blocked polydimethyl siloxane having a viscosity of 1000 mPa.s, but with the amount of<br>
resin varying from 2% for Example 9a, over 1% for Example 9b, 0.5% for Example 9c, 0.1%<br>
for Example 9d and 0% for comparative Example 9e based on the total weight of the foam<br>
control composition, and using a reaction temperature of 60Â°C for 3 hours. All compositions<br>
were then emulsified in accordance with the detailed process as shown in Example 3,<br>
immediately following the hydrosilylation reaction.<br><br>
[0065] The results are summarised in the Table below.<br><br>
[0066] It shows that the compound without resin was very difficult to emulsify and gave a<br>
very inhomogeneous emulsion. It could also be seen that addition of 0.1 % resin improved<br>
the emulsification but still gave some inhomogeneity, while the presence of 0.5% resin<br>
produced a perfect emulsion. Higher amounts of resin did not give a visible further<br>
improvement upon emulsification. In addition it was found that the presence of the resin<br>
improved the consistency of particle size of the emulsion particles, and even managed to<br>
reduce the particle size and hence improve the stability and homogeneity of the emulsion.<br>
[0067] Details are provided in the Table below<br><br>
[0068] These results confirm that resin addition greatly enhances or restores the<br>
emulsification of foam control compositions according to the invention. Only very small<br>
addition levels are necessary.<br><br>
