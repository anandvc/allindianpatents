The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for their preparation, as well as to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament which particularly acts on the central nervous system.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Many disorders and conditions of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic, and the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. For example, serotonin has been implicated in a number of disorders and conditions which originate in the central nervous system. A number of pharmacological and genetic experiments involving receptors for serotonin strongly implicate the 5-HT2C receptor subtype in the regulation of<br>
food intake (see e. g., Obes. Res. 1995.3, Suppl. 4,449S-462S, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism 1999.1,207-214, and Drags Future 2001.26,383-393). The 5-HT2C receptor<br>
subtype is transcribed and expressed in hypothalamic structures associated with appetite regulation. It has been demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP), which has some preference for the 5-HT2C receptor, reduces food intake in mice that express the normal 5-HT2C receptor while the compound lacks activity in mice expressing the mutated inactive form of the 5-HT2C receptor (Nature 1995. 374, 542-546). In a recent clinical study, a slight but sustained reduction in body weight was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment with mCPP in obese subjects fPsvchopharmacologv 1997.133, 309-312). Recently, a series of pvrcolo[3,2,l-y]quinoIine derivatives was identified to be 5-HT2C receptor agonists having selectivity over the S-HT2A receptor (Isaac M., et al., Biooig. Med.<br><br>
Chem. Lett. 2000,10, 919-921). The compounds are said to offer a novel approach to the treatment of obesity and epilepsy.<br>
Body weight reduction has also been reported from clinical studies with other "serotonergic" agents (see e.g. IDrugs 199S. 1, 456-470). For example, the 5-HT reuptake       inhibitor fluoxetine and the 5-HT releasing agenf'reuptake inhibitor dexfenfluramine have exhibited weight reduction in controlled studies. However, currently available drugs that increase serotonergic transmission appear to have only a moderate and, in some cases, transient effects on the body weight.<br>
The 5-HT2C receptor subtype has also been suggested to be involved in CNS<br>
disorders such as depression and anxiety (Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 199S, 7, 1587-1599; IDrugs. 1999,2,109-120).<br>
The 5-HT2C receptor subtype has further been suggested to be involved in urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (IDrugs, 1999, 2, 109-120).<br>
Compounds which have a selective effect on the 5-HT2C receptor may therefore have<br>
a therapeutic potential in the treatment of disorders like those mentioned above. Of course, selectivity also reduces the potential for adverse effects mediated by other serotonin receptors.<br>

WO 00/76984 and WO 02/40457 disclose aryl-piperazine derivatives which bind to the 5-HT2Q receptor (agonists and antagonists) useful for the treatment of serotonin-related<br>
disorders. However, the 5-HT2C receptor selectivity of the compounds according to the present invention is unexpectedly high compared to the compounds according to WO 00/76984 and WO 02/40457.<br>
The absence of appreciable affinity to certain other 5-HT receptor subtypes may provide the basis for an improved therapeutic index compared with, the general activation of all the different 5-HT receptor subtypes by 5-HT reuptake inhibitors and/or 5-HT releasing agents. The anti-obesity drug dexfenfluramine, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT releaser, was withdrawn from the market in September 1997 because of several reports suggesting the association of this drug with a risk of primary pulmonary hypertension and of heart valve abnormalities (see, e.g. Kolanowski, J. A risk-benefit assessment of anti-obesity drugs. Drug Safety 1999,20,119-131). The 5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine, currently on the market for the treatment of obesity, can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. The use of sibutramine has been suspended in Italy in March 2002 because of two cardiovascular deaths and its safety is currently under review in other European countries where, in the UK and France alone, there have been a total of 103 serious adverse reaction reports in people using the drug including two deaths in Britain. Taken together, there is a need for the development of safer anti-obesity agents.<br>
It is important to minimize potential adverse advents due to activation of 5-HT2A an^ 5.HT2B receptor subtypes. 5-HT2A receptor agonism is associated with vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation and hallucinogenic episodes and 5-HT2B receptor agonism might play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Stimulation of 5-HT2A ^^ 5_HT2B receptors might also have a link to cardiac fibrosis.<br><br>

One of the initiating events of atherosclerois is endothelial injury followed by platelet aggregation. During atherosclerosis, platelets aggregate more readily and greater quantities of serotonin are released from platelets. Vascular responses to serotonin released by activated platelets are profoundly altered in a direction that favours vasoconstriction (arterial spasm), which ultimately may lead to thrombosis and complete obstruction of the vessel. Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Serotonin is known to be amitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells by stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor [tentatively via activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and/or PKC (protein kinase C) dependent pathways], see:<br>
(a)	Lee, S.-L. et al. Serotonin stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase activity through the formation of superoxide anion. Am. J. Physiol. 1999, 277, (2PU), L-282-L291.<br>

Furthermore, it has been suggested that increased vasoconstrictor response to 5-HT in atherosclerotic vessels might be due to supersensitive 5-HT2A receptors, see; Fujiwara, T. et<br>
al. Augmented responses to 5-HT2-receptor-mediated vasoconstrictions in atherosclerotic rabbit common carotid arteries. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995, 26, 503-510.<br>
A 5-HT-induced upregulation of thrombin receptor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, via activation of 5-HT2A receptors, has also been implicated to play a role in atherosclerosis, see: Schini-Kerth V.B. et al.

(a) Launay, J.-M. et al. Function of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor in pulmonary hypertension. Nature Med. 2002, 8,1129-1135.<br>
The following references show that 5-HT2A and especially 5-HT2B agonism is associated with the origin of cardiac fibrosis after treatment with marketed anti-obesity reparations such as dexfenfluramin:<br><br>
(a)	Rothman, R.B. et al. Evidence for possible involvment of 5-HT2B receptors in the cardiac valvulopathy associated with fenfluramine and other serotonergic medications. Circulation 2000,102,2836-2841.<br>

As denoted below, the present compounds may be used in order to treat serotonin-related conditions such as menopausal and post-menopausal hot flushes. Berendsen H.H.G. "Hot flushes and serotonin". Journal of the British Menopause Society. 2002, 8, 30-34, indicates that non-hormonal treatment with either 5-HT2A receptor antagonists or 5-HTIQ<br>
receptor agonists may have several advantages over hormonal therapy.<br>
Another example of serotonin-related disorders is weight gain associated with antipsychotic drug administration. WO 02/19998 discloses that the use of atypical antipsychotic agents is associated with weight gain in up to 50% of patients, a significant portion of the patient population. Piesla, M.J. et al. Atypical antipsychotic-like effects of 5-HT2C agonists. Schizophrenia Res. 2001, 49 (1-2; Sp Iss, Suppl.) 95, discloses that 5-HT2C agonists have anti-psychotic potential. Therefore, therapy using 5-HT2C agonists will<br>
probably counteract an increase in body weight induced by antipsychotic drugs without counteracting the antipsychotic effect. It is reasonable to expect that the antipsychotic effect will be strengthened.<br>
