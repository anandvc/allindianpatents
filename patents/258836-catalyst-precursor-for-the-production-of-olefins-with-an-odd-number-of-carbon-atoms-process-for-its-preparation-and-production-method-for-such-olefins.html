				<td>CATALYST PRECURSOR FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OLEFINS WITH AN ODD NUMBER OF CARBON ATOMS, PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION AND PRODUCTION METHOD FOR SUCH OLEFINS<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst precursor for the production of odd olefins, a process for its preparation as well as to a method for the production of odd olefins using that catalyst precursor.<br>
Processes for the oligomerization of ethylene or other olefins are well known in the prior art. For example, coordination compounds of iron halides with 2,6-diiminopyridines have been reported to be precatalysts for the polymerization and oligomerization of ethylene, see Small, B. L.; Brookhart, M. Journal of the American Chemical Society 1998, 120, 7143-7144; and Birtovsek, G. J. P.; Gibson, V.; Kimberley, B. S.; Maddox, P. J.; McTavish, S. J.; Solan, G. A.; White, A. J. P.; Williams, D. J. Chemical Communications (Cambridge) 1998, 849-850.<br>
Further, olefins with odd numbers of carbon atoms, e.g. 1-heptene, 1-nonene, 1-undecene or 1-tridecene are valuable chemical intermediates for the synthesis of various compounds. Up to now such odd numbered olefins are mainly isolated from natural products or are produced hi small amounts as side products of commercial procedures for the production of oligomers with even numbers of carbon atoms, e.g. the SHOP process.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art and to provide a catalyst composition which may be utilized in an oligomerization process of ethylene for providing an increased amount of olefins having odd numbered carbon atoms. Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of that catalyst composition.<br>
The object is achieved by a catalyst precursor for the production of odd olefins having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X and Y are halogen and n is 2 or 3.<br>
Preferably, X is chlorine and Y is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Additionally, a process for the preparation of the inventive catalyst precursor is provided comprising the steps of:<br>
(i)       reacting 2,6-diacetylpyridine with a suitably substituted aniline to prepare a 2,6-diiminopyridine according to the following scheme:<br><br>
reacting the 2,6-diiminopyridine obtained in step (i) with iron halide according to the scheme:<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
eferably, step (i) and (ii) are carried out in an inert solvent, such as toluene, n-butanol, methylene dichloride or diethyl ether.<br>
More preferably, the oxidation state of the iron in the iron halide is +2 or +3.<br>
Additionally, a method for the production of odd olefins is provided, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	activating the inventive catalyst precursor with an activator; and<br>
(b)	oligomerizing ethylene with the activated catalyst precursor obtained in<br>
step (a).<br>
Preferably, the activator is an allcyl aluminum, methyl aluminoxane, modified methyl aluminox-ane, borate or a superacid.<br>
More preferably, the activator is an aluminum compound and the ratio of aluminum to iron is from about 50 to about 10000, preferably from about 200 to about 3000.<br>
In one embodiment, the oligomerization temperature is from about -100 to about 300°C, preferably from about -10 to about 100°C.<br>
The oligomerization may be carried out in an inert solvent, such as toluene and/or pentane.<br><br>
Finally, the ethylene pressure may be preferably from about 0.1 to about 60 bar, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10 bar.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that in a process for the oligomerization of ethylene using the catalyst precursor according to the invention olefinic oligomers may be obtained having a significantly high amount of odd numbered olefins incorporated.<br>
Further, depending on the specific catalyst precursor choosen and on the specific reaction conditions, the ratio of oligomers with odd and even numbers of carbon atoms may be optimized.<br>

In a 25 ml round bottom flask 3 g of 2,6-diacetylpyridine (FW 163.13,18.4 mmol) and 100 ml of toluene were placed. Next a few milligrams of p-toluenesulfonic acid were added followed by 7.81 g of 5-chloro-2-methyl-aniline (FW 141.60, 55.2 mmol).

Example 5<br>
Oligomerization using [2,6-bis-[l -(5-chloro-2-methylphenylimino)-ethyl]-pyridine]iron(II)dibromide as catalyst precursor<br>
A Schlenk tube was filled with 150 ml of toluene and 0.068 g of [2,6-bis-[l-(5-chloro-2-methylphenylimino)-ethyl]-pyridine]iron(II)dibromide (FW 625.99, 0.11 mmol) was added. The cocatalyst MAO was added (11.6 ml, Al:Fe=500:l) and the Schlenlc tube was pressurized with 1 bar of ethylene. The reaction was carried out at RT for an hour and the activity was determined by measuring the weight gained after releasing the pressure. After that the mixture was cooled to 0°C and hydrolyzed by adding water. The organic layer was separated, dried over Na2SO4 and subjected to GC analysis.<br>
The resulting activity was 2480 g(PE)/g(Fe)*h"' and the amount of oligomers with odd numbers of carbon atoms was approximately 19%.<br>
Example 6<br>
Oligomerization using [2,6-bis-[l-(5-bromo-2-methylphenylimino)-ethyl]-pyridine]iron(II)dichloride as catalyst precursor<br><br>
A Schlenlc tube was filled with 150 ml of toluene and 0.0176 g of [2,6-bis-[l-(5-bromo-2-methylphenylimino)-ethyl]-pyridine]iron(II)dichloride (FW 625.99, 0.028 mmol) was added. The cocatalyst MAO was added (4.3 ml, Al:Fe=750:l) and the Schlenlc tube was pressurized with 1 bar of ethylene. The reaction was carried out at 0°C for an hour and the activity was determined by measuring the weight gained after releasing the pressure. After that the mixture was hydrolyzed by adding water. The organic layer was separated, dried over Na2SO4 and subjected to GC analysis.<br>
The resulting activity was 2980 g(PE)/g(Fe)*h~' and the amount of oligomers with odd numbers of carbon atoms was approximately 6%.<br>
As can be seen, using the catalyst precursors according to the present invention in a method for oligomerization of ethylene may result in significant amounts of oligomers with odd numbers of carbon atoms.<br>
