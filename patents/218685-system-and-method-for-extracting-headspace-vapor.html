				<td> The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for extracting<br>
headspace vapor from a vessel. More specifically, the invention relates to a<br>
system and method for maximizing the amount of vapor extracted by maintaining<br>
5a constant flow as the pressure inside the vessel decreases.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Chromatography is essentially a physical method of separation in which<br>
constituents of a test sample in a carrier gas or liquid are adsorbed or absorbed<br>
and then desorbed by a stationary phase material in a column. A pulse of the<br>
sample is introduced into a steady flow of carrier gas, which carries the sample<br>
lOinto a chromatographic column. The inside of the column is lined with a liquid,<br>
and interactions between this liquid and the various elements of the sample—<br>
which differ based upon differences among distribution coefficients of the<br>
elements—cause the sample to be separated into the respective elements. At<br>
the end of the column, the individual components are more or less separated in<br>
15time. Detection of the gas provides a time-scaled pattern, typically called a<br>
chromatogram, that, by calibration or comparison with known samples, indicates<br>
the constituents of the test sample. An example of the process by which this<br>
occurs is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,252 to Hinshaw.<br>
Often, the sample is first obtained using a sampling device, which<br>
20subsequently transfers the sample to the chromatograph. One means of<br>
obtaining a sample and introducing it into a chromatographic column is known as<br>
"headspace sampling." In conventional headspace sampling, sample material is<br>
sealed in a vial and subjected to constant temperature conditions for a specified<br>
time. Analyte concentrations in the vial gas phase should reach equilibrium with<br>
25the liquid and/or solid phases during this thermostatting time. The vial is<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
-2-<br>
subsequently pressurized with carrier gas to a level greater than the "natural"<br>
internal pressure resulting from thermostatting and equilibration. Then the<br>
pressurized vial is connected to the chromatographic column in such a way as to<br>
allow for the transfer of a portion of the vial gas phase into the column for a short<br>
period of time. An example of such a sampling device is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,484,483 to Riegger et. al. An example of a chromatographic<br>
system employing such a sampling device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,711,786 to Hinshaw, which describes using a chromatographic injector<br>
between the vial and the chromatographic column.<br>
10	Typically, it is desired to pre-concentrate the analytes in the sample, and<br>
occasionally, remove moisture therefrom, prior to introducing the sample into the<br>
chromatographic column. Accordingly, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,792,423 and 6,395,560 to Markelov, these systems will typically include some<br>
kind of "trap" for this purpose, which retains the analytes as they are carried<br>
15through the trap, and which are later released from the trap, usually by heating,<br>
and swept into the chromatographic column.<br>
Though various types of traps have been suggested, one particularly<br>
advantageous way to perform this pre-concentration (and possible moisture<br>
removal) prior to introducing the sample into a chromatographic column is<br>
20through the use of an adsorbent trap. These traps, which adsorb the analytes<br>
and then subsequently desorbed those analytes, do not suffer from the same<br>
slow flow rates as on-line traps (such as cryogenic traps) that result from the<br>
impedance of the column.   When using an adsorbent trap, a carrier gas can be<br>
used to first pressurize the vial and then, after pressurization, to carry the sample<br>
25vapor through the trap, which will adsorb the analytes to be measured, and then<br>
vent out of the system, which is the simplest way to extract vapor from a vessel.<br>
Accordingly, numerous arrangements employing an adsorbent trap have been<br>
employed for the purpose of pre-concentrating the analytes of a sample<br>
extracted by a sampling device such as a headspace sampler. Examples of<br>
5Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
-3-<br>
such arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,482 to Markelov and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,652,625 to Tipler.<br>
However, these systems typically suffer from several disadvantages. One<br>
problem is that the process is slow. This is due to the fact that the pressure in<br>
5the vial is proportional to the amount of sample in the vial. Therefore, as the<br>
sample vapor elutes from the vial, the pressure drops. Accordingly, the rate of<br>
flow decreases, resulting in undesirable vent times. Indeed, trials have shown<br>
that a 22ml_ vial pressurized to 40 psig with helium can take longer than five<br>
minutes to effect a full extraction, even with high initial flow rates.<br>
10	Another problem with current systems is that, in order to maximize<br>
performance with respect to resolution, sensitivity and inertness, it is generally<br>
desired to use capillary columns for chromatography. However, with capillary<br>
columns, the carrier gas flow rates will be low, so direct injection of large<br>
quantities of vapor is not possible. For example, an injection volume of about<br>
15100 uL is typical. A typical headspace sample vial, however, usually has a<br>
capacity of about 22 ml_, with a maximum sample volume about half that.<br>
Therefore, only about 1% of the total headspace vapor is actually injected into<br>
the column. Accordingly, system sensitivity can be increased nearly 100x over<br>
current headspace sampling systems by increasing the percentage of the<br>
20available headspace vapor that is actually injected into the column. This is<br>
particularly useful for applications requiring very low detection limits, such as<br>
environmental and other trace-level analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds<br>
(VOCs) in a variety of sample matrices.<br>
Yet another problem with current systems is that a headspace sampler is<br>
25typically used to test a number of large number vials in sequence, and<br>
occasionally, a vial may have a leak or for some other reason may not contain<br>
the proper amount of sample, leading to erroneous analytical data. Accordingly,<br>
it is advantageous to review the pressure decay profiles for these vials—i.e. in<br>
the decay in pressure as a function of time. However, as previously mentioned,<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
10	-4-<br>
the pressure in the vial is proportional to the amount of sample present, and<br>
thus, a plot of pressure decay as a function of time results in exponential, rather<br>
than linear, profiles, making a determination of whether the rate of decay is<br>
appropriate difficult.<br>
5	What is desired, therefore, is a system and method for extracting<br>
headspace vapor that reduces the time required to vent fluid through a trap.<br>
What is further desired is a system and method for extracting headspace vapor<br>
that increases the amount of sample vapor that is actually injected into a<br>
chromatographic column. What is also desired is a system and method for<br>
lOextracting headspace vapor that increases the ability to check for leaks in the<br>
sample vials and verify that the proper amount of sample is present therein.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a system and<br>
method for extracting headspace vapor that prevents the rate of flow through a<br>
trap from decreasing as the sample elutes from a headspace vial.<br>
15	It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method for extracting headspace vapor that effectively extracts residual sample<br>
vapor remaining in the vial after an initial extraction.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method for extracting headspace vapor that produces linear pressure decay<br>
20profiles to facilitate checking for leaks in headspace vials and the presence of<br>
proper sample amounts.<br>
To overcome the deficiencies of the prior art and to achieve at least some<br>
of the objects and advantages listed, the invention comprises a method of<br>
extracting headspace vapor, including providing a vessel holding headspace<br>
25vapor containing analytes to be measured, inserting a receptacle into the vessel,<br>

headspace vapor, and out a vent, and controlling the flow of the carrier gas<br>
carrying the headspace vapor as it is vented such that the rate of flow is<br>
increased as the rate of flow decreases due to the depletion of headspace vapor<br>

the headspace vapor, wherein, when the vessel port of the receptacle is in fluid<br>
communication with the vessel and the carrier gas inlet is open, carrier gas flows<br>
into and pressurizes the vessel, wherein, when the vessel port of the receptacle<br>
is in fluid communication with the vessel and the carrier gas inlet is closed, the<br>
25headspace vapor and carrier gas flow into the adsorbent housing and are vented<br>
through the vent, and a flow controller in fluid communication with the adsorbent<br>

Detailed Description Of The Drawings<br>
The basic components of one embodiment of a system for extracting<br>
headspace vapor 10 in accordance with the invention are illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
As used in the description, the terms "top," "bottom," "above," "below," "over,"<br>
"under," "on top," "underneath," "up," "down," "upper," "lower," "front," "rear,"<br>
25"forward" and "back" refer to the objects referenced when in the orientation<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
-7-<br>
illustrated in the drawings, which orientation is not necessary for achieving the<br>
objects of the invention.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the system 10 in standby mode, a<br>
sampling device, such as a headspace sampler, holds a plurality of vessels (i.e.,<br>
headspace vials) 20 that contain the sample to be extracted and analyzed.<br>
Typically, the headspace sampler includes a sampling needle 22 disposed in a<br>
sampling head 24, and the needle 22 is adapted to be inserted and withdrawn<br>
from the vessels 20. The sampling head 24 has a sample chamber 26, and the<br>
sampling needle 22 has a vessel port 28 through which fluid is communicated<br>
lObetween the needle 22 and the interior of the vials 20 and a sample chamber<br>
port 30 through which fluid is communicated between the needle 22 the sample<br>
chamber 26.<br>
An adsorbent housing 32 having an adsorbent 34 disposed therein<br>
(commonly referred to as an adsorbent trap), a flow controller 72, a fixed<br>
15restrictor 74, and a vent 36 are in fluid communication with the sample chamber<br>
26. Accordingly, when headspace vapor is extracted from a vial 20 and mixes<br>
with a carrier gas, this sample mixture can flow through the adsorbent 34, which<br>
will adsorb the analytes to be measured, and out the vent 36 to the atmosphere.<br>
In certain advantageous embodiments, the adsorbent 34 is hydrophobic, thereby<br>
20allowing moisture to be easily purged from the system by carrier gas, as further<br>
explained below. The adsorbent 34 may include any material suitable for this<br>
purpose, such as, for example, graphitized carbon black, a polymeric adsorbent,<br>
or a carbon molecular sieve.<br>
The adsorbent housing 32 is in fluid communication with a gas<br>
25chromatograph, the basic components of which are a chromatographic column<br>
36 and a detector (not shown). Accordingly, analytes that have been adsorbed<br>
by the adsorbent 34 can be desorbed into the column 36. For this reason, in<br>
certain advantageous embodiments, the adsorbent housing 32 is temperature<br>
controllable, and thus, the adsorbent 34 can be heated to desorb the analytes<br>
25Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
-8-<br>
retained by the adsorbent 34 before a carrier gas sweeps them out of the<br>
housing 32 and into the column 36.<br>
A plurality of gas inlets are provided to supply and control fluid flowing<br>
throughout the system 10. For example, the system includes a first carrier gas<br>
5inlet 42 for generally providing carrier gas needed by the system. For instance,<br>
the inlet 42 may provide carrier gas to different parts of the system 10 at different<br>
stages of operation, such as, for example, by providing the sampling head 24<br>
with fluid to pressurize the vessel 20, or, as another example, by providing carrier<br>
gas to the adsorbent housing 32 to carry a sample containing analytes thereto or<br>
lOto sweep away moisture contained therein. The system 10 also has a second<br>
gas inlet 44 for providing gas that may be used by various parts of the system at<br>
various stages, but primarily for isolating the chromatographic column 36 from<br>
the rest of the system in order to prevent contaminated fluid from entering the<br>
column 36 until it is specifically desired to desorb the analytes thereinto. The<br>
15system also includes a third inlet 46, primarily for providing carrier gas to the<br>
adsorbent housing 32 in order to sweep analytes into the column 36 as the<br>
analytes are desorbed from the adsorbent 34. Valves 52, 54, 56 are provided to<br>
open and close inlets 42, 44, 46, respectively.<br>
Operation of the above described assembly is illustrated stepwise Figures<br>
202-7. A pressurization step is illustrated in Figure 2. As shown therein, the<br>
sampling needle 22 descends into the vial 20, bringing the vessel port 28 into<br>
fluid communication with the interior of the vial 20. The inlets 42, 44, 46 are all<br>
opened, sending fluid into the sample chamber 26, through the chamber port 30,<br>
down through the needle 22, and into the vial 20 (indicated by arrows A). In this<br>
25way, the vial is pressurized.<br>
A venting (or trap load) step is illustrated in Figure 3. As shown therein,<br>
the inlet valve 52 is closed, terminating the supply of fluid from the inlet 42.<br>
Likewise, the valve 56 terminates the supply of fluid from inlet 46. As a result,<br>
fluid containing the analytes to be measured elutes from the vial 20 through the<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
30	-9-<br>
vessel port 28, through the needle 22, out the chamber port 30, through the<br>
adsorbent housing 32, where the adsorbent 34 adsorbs the analytes, and out<br>
through the vent 36. (indicated by arrows B). The inlet valve 54 remains open,<br>
allowing fluid to continue to enter through the inlet 44 and isolate the column 36<br>
5(indicated by arrows C).<br>
Because the pressure in the vial 20 is proportional to the amount of<br>
sample in the vial 20, the pressure drops as the headspace vapor elutes from<br>
the vial 20, which normally causes the rate of flow to gradually decrease during<br>
the venting process. To counter this result, the flow controller 72, in response to<br>
lOthe gradual decrease in pressure, gradually increases the flow therethrough,<br>
effectively increasing the rate of flow as the depletion of the headspace vapor in<br>
the vial 20 decreases the rate of flow. In certain advantageous embodiments,<br>
the flow controller 72 is configured to increase flow in an amount directly<br>
proportional to the decrease in pressure, thereby maintaining a constant flow<br>
15rate. In this way, the process of extracting headspace vapor from the vial 20<br>
does not immediately begin gradually slowing down as the venting stage<br>
proceeds, thereby resulting in quicker extraction times.<br>
In some embodiments, the flow controller 72 comprises a forward<br>
pressure regulator. However, in other embodiments, the flow controller may<br>
20comprises any device suitable for controlling flow therethrough, such as, for<br>
example, a mass flow controller or an electronic flow controller.<br>
The aforementioned steps of pressurizing the sample vial 20 and venting<br>
the headspace therein through the adsorbent housing 32 and out the vent 36,<br>
however, does not extract all of the headspace from the vial 20.   Instead, a<br>
25certain percentage of the original headspace vapor remains in the vial 20 at<br>
atmospheric pressure. This residual vapor remaining in the vial 20 after the<br>
initial pressurization and venting is represented by the following equation:<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>
-10-<br><br>
where R is the residual vapor (percentage of original headspace vapor)<br>
remaining in the vial, P,o is the absolute pressure (normally, atmospheric) after<br>
venting through the adsorbent housing 32 has occurred, and Phi\s the absolute<br>
5pressure (elevated) before venting through the adsorbent housing 32 has<br>
occurred.<br>
While increasing the value of Phi or reducing the value of P/o would<br>
increase the amount of vapor extracted, a more practical way of reducing the<br>
value of R (i.e., increasing the amount of vapor extracted) is by performing<br>
multiple pressurization/venting cycles. Because the amount of time expended to<br>
perform a pressurization-venting cycle is significantly decreased due to the use<br>
of the flow controller 72 to maintain a constant flow rate, it is possible to perform<br>
multiple cycles in succession. When multiple cycles are performed, the residual<br>
vapor is represented by the equation:<br><br>
where n is the number of cycles. As is readily seen, the lower the pressure, the<br>
more pressurization-venting cycles are required in order to reduce the value of R<br>
(i.e., increase the amount of vapor extracted) to a particular desired value.<br>
Typically a processor 70 automatically controls the amount of<br>
20pressurization-venting cycles that are performed. Accordingly, an operator of the<br>
system 10 can determine how many cycles are desired by deciding upon an<br>
appropriate balance between the amount of vapor to be extracted and the<br>
amount of time to be expended performing additional cycles, and the operator<br>
can then input this value to the processor 70. Alternately, the operator can<br>
25determine what percentage of residual vapor (R) is acceptable and input this<br>
Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br><br>
-11 -<br>
value to the processor 70, which can then calculate amount of pressurization-<br>
venting cycles required according to the following equation:<br>
The number of pressurization-venting cycles input by the operator, or<br>
5calculated by the processor 70, are then performed successively before the<br>
system 10 proceeds to perform the remaining steps discussed below. Figure 8<br>
illustrates a representation of the pressure inside the vial over time when multiple<br>
pressurization-venting cycles are employed.<br>
Returning again to Figure 3, in certain advantageous embodiments, the<br>
10system 10 includes a gauge for determining the pressure in the headspace vial<br>
20. Though this may be any device capable of measuring the pressure in the<br>
vial 20 and communicating this information to either the system or an operator of<br>
the system, in certain embodiments, this gauge is a pressure transducer 62 in<br>
fluid communication with the vial 20. Accordingly, as the carrier gas carrying the<br>
15headspace vapor flows past the transducer 62, the operator may be promptly<br>
alerted upon detection of an undesirable condition in the vial 20 by, for example,<br>
an LED, an audible alarm, or a log report or profile on a visual display screen.<br>
Because the rate of flow remains constant due to the use of the flow<br>
controller 72, various undesirable conditions can be easily detected by<br>
20monitoring the pressure with the transducer 62, such as a leak in the vial, an<br>
incorrect starting pressure, an defective vial resulting in abnormal vial capacity,<br>
or the presence of too much or too little sample in the vial. As noted above, the<br>
drop in pressure is proportional to the amount of sample flowing out of the vial<br>
20. Because vent time is normally proportional to both the sample volume in the<br>
25vessel and the pressure, a plot of the pressure decay overtime generally results<br>
in an exponential profile, making measurement and comparison of the pressure<br>

decays somewhat difficult. However, because the flow controller 72 maintains a<br>
constant flow rate, a plot of the pressure decay over time results in a linear<br>
profile. Therefore, measurement of the pressure decay is very useful in<br>
determining whether the vial has a leak or other undesired condition.<br>
5	The system is first calibrated by obtaining a properly measured and<br>
sealed reference vial and running it on the headspace sampler. A number of<br>
readings of the pressure are taken at various points in time and stored in system<br>
memory for later comparison. Later, as each actual sample vial is tested, the<br>
same number of readings are taken and are subsequently compared to the<br>
10corresponding values stored for the reference vial, and will check for any<br>
significant deviation. For example, the system may take twenty one readings for<br>
each of the reference vial and the sample vials, and then look for a deviation in<br>
the values of the sample vials of more than ten percent in three successive<br>
points from the reference vial. Values that are too high, for example, may<br>
indicate that too much sample may be present in the vial, while values that are<br>
too low may indicate that too little sample is in the vial or that the vial has a leak.<br>
If a deviation is found, the sample may be flagged in a system log or the operator<br>
may be otherwise alerted to the defective vial.<br>
The transducer 62 may be located anywhere suitable for measuring the<br>
20pressure prior to the influence of a flow controller. For example, as disclosed in<br>
Figure 3, a transducer 64 may be positioned in the flow path immediately<br>
preceding the flow controller 72. However, in certain advantageous<br>
embodiments, a position proximate to the sampling head 24 is used, such as the<br>
position of pressure transducer 62 located at the needle purge 66, in order to<br>
25avoid possible external factors from effecting an accurate measurement of the<br>
pressure, such as, for example, a slight pressure drop across the adsorbent 34.<br>
Next, in embodiments where a significant amount of moisture is present in<br>
the sample being analyzed, a dry purge step may be desired. As shown in<br>
Figure 4, the needle 22 is first withdrawn from the vial 20, bringing the vessel<br>
45Express Mail No. EL 574 206 822 US<br><br>

port 28 above the seal 60. Next, as illustrated in Figure 5, the inlet valve 52 is<br>
opened again, thereby allowing fluid to once again enter the system via the inlet<br>
42. The fluid flows down into the adsorbent housing 32, sweeping any moisture<br>
therein out through the vent 36 (indicated by arrows D). Once again, the inlet<br>
5valve 54 remains open, allowing fluid to continue to enter through the inlet 44<br>
and isolate the column 36 (indicated by arrows E).<br>
A desorption step is illustrated in Figure 6. As shown therein, the valves<br>
52, 54 are closed, terminating the supply of fluid from inlets 42, 44. The valve 56<br>
is opened, allowing fluid to flow in through inlet 46. The adsorbent housing 32 is<br>
10heated to desorb the analytes retained by the adsorbent 34. Carrier gas enters<br>
through the inlet 46 and flows into the adsorbent housing 32, sweeping the<br>
desorbed analytes into the chromatographic column 36 (indicated by arrows F).<br>
It should be understood that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting,<br>
and that obvious modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
15departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, reference should be made<br>
primarily to the accompanying claims, rather than the foregoing specification, to<br>
determine the scope of the invention.<br>
