				<td>HERBICIDE COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to oil dispersions comprising a 2-benzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicide, to suspoemulsions resulting from dispersing the oil dispersion in water, to a method of making the oil dispersions and the suspoemulsions and to a method of controlling unwanted plants using the suspoemulsions.<br>
2-benzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicides are well known for their excellent weed controlling properties. Several formulations of 2-benzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicides are known and used with good effect.<br>
Agrochemical formulations comprising a solid active ingredient suspended in an oil are well known. Such formulations are referred to as oil dispersions (GIFAP code: "OD"). The oil dispersion is a concentrate which is diluted with water before use to produce an aqueous composition which is used in controlling plants or plant growth. Dilution in water results in a suspo-emulsion if the active ingredient is insoluble in water (as is the case with mesotrione); if the active ingredient is soluble in water an emulsion is formed. To facilitate dispersion in water such formulations contain emulsifiers, dispersants and further formulation components such as thickeners, antifoams and solid carriers. Oil dispersions are often chosen if the active ingredient is sensitive to water or if the adjuvancy of the oil is required for good biological performance. Oil dispersions are usually free of water either to prevent degradation of any sensitive active ingredient and/or to prevent the risk of phase separation of the formulation.<br>
We have now discovered that stable oil dispersions of a 2-benzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicide can be obtained by the addition of water and optionally an acid to the dispersion.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided an oil dispersion comprising:<br>

Especially preferred are wherein the additional active ingredient is a triazine herbicide, such as atrazine, cyanazine, terbuthylazine and simazine, or a sulfonyl urea herbicide, such as triasulfuron, metsulfuron, rimsulfuron, thifensulfuron and nicosulfuron, or a chloro acetamide herbicide, such as acetochlor, alachlor and S-metolachlor. The content of such optional active ingredients in the oil dispersion is 0.2 -40 %, preferably 0.5 - 20 %.<br>
Oil dispersions in which the solid active ingredients are finely dispersed in the oil are preferred. Fine dispersions are conveniently obtained by grinding together the active ingredient(s) and the oil, with one or more further formulation component(s). Preferably, the active ingredient is milled until the average particle size diameter is one micron or less. This can conveniently be achieved by using a bead mill. In the present invention water is conveniently introduced by grinding a mixture of mesotrione as a wet paste, other formulation ingredients and oil. Additional water may be added as such before or after grinding.<br>
The oil dispersion is diluted with water before use to produce an aqueous composition which is used in controlling plants or plant growth. Dilution in water results in a suspoemulsion of the 2-benzoyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione herbicide. The invention also relates to a suspoemulsion obtained by dilution of an oil dispersion according to the present invention.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of controlling plants which comprises applying to the plants or to the locus thereof a herbicidally effective amount of a suspoemulsion obtained by dilution of an oil dispersion according to the present invention.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of inhibiting plant growth which comprises applying to the plants or to the locus thereof a herbicidally effective amount of a suspoemulsion obtained by dilution of an oil dispersion according to the present invention.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of selectively controlling grasses and weeds in crops of useful plants which comprises applying to the useful plants or locus thereof or to the area of cultivation a herbicidally effective amount of a suspoemulsion obtained by dilution of an oil dispersion according to the present invention.<br>
The term "herbicide" as used herein means a compound that controls or modifies the growth of plants. The term "herbicidally effective amount" means the quantity of such a compound or combination of such compounds that is capable of producing a controlling or modifying effect on the growth of plants. Controlling or modifying effects include all deviation from natural development, for example: killing, retardation, leaf bum, albinism, dwarfing and the like. The term "plants" refers to all physical parts of a plant, including seeds, seedlings, saplings, roots, tubers, stems, stalks, foliage, and fruits. The term "locus" is intended to include soil, seeds, and seedlings, as well as established vegetation.<br>
The rates of application of the active ingredient(s) may vary within wide limits and depend on the nature of the soil, the method of application (pre- or post-emergence; seed dressing; application to the seed furrow; no tillage application etc.), the crop plant, the grass or weed to be controlled, the prevailing climatic conditions, and other factors governed by the method of application, the time of application and the target crop. Mesotrione is generally applied at a rate of from 10 to 2000 g/ha, preferably from 50 to 500 g/ha, even more preferably from 70 to 250 g/ha. The application rate of optional other active ingredient(s) is determined by their biological efficacy. For example triazine herbicides, such as atrazine, terbuthylazine and simazine, are applied at a rate of from 300 to 3000 g/ha, whereas sulfonyl urea herbicides, such as triasulfuron, metsulfuron, rimsulfuron, thifensulfuron and nicosulfuron, are applied at a rate of from 5 to 150 g/ha, and chloro acetamide herbicides, such as acetochlor, alachlor and S-metolachlor, are applied at a rate of from 500 to 3000 g/ha.<br>
Crops of useful plants in which the composition according to the invention can be used include perennial crops, such as citrus fruit, grapevines, nuts, oil palms, olives, pome fruit, stone fruit and rubber, and annual arable crops, such as cereals, for example barley and wheat, cotton, oilseed rape, maize, rice, soy beans, sugar beet, sugar cane, sunflowers, ornamentals and vegetables, especially maize.<br>
The grasses and weeds to be controlled may be both monocotyledonous species, for example Agrostis, Alopecurus, Avena, Bromus, Cyperus, Digitaria, Echinochloa, Lolium, Monochorea, Rottboellia, Sagittaria, Scirpus, Setaria, Sida and Sorghum, and dicotyledonous species, for example Abutilon, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Ipomoea, Nasturtium, Sinapis, Solanum, Stellaria, Veronica, Viola and Xanthium.<br>
Crops are to be understood as also including those crops which have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides (e.g. ALS-, GS-, EPSPS-, PPO-and HPPD-inhibitors) by conventional methods of breeding or by genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has been rendered tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, by conventional methods of breeding is Clearfield® summer rape (canola). Examples of crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by genetic engineering methods include e.g. glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady® and LibertyLink®.<br>
Crops are also to be understood as being those which have been rendered resistant to harmful insects by genetic engineering methods, for example Bt maize (resistant to European corn borer), Bt cotton (resistant to cotton boll weevil) and also Bt potatoes (resistant to Colorado beetle). Examples of Bt maize are the Bt 176 maize hybrids of NK® (Syngenta Seeds). The Bt toxin is a protein that is formed naturally by Bacillus thuringiensis soil bacteria. Examples of toxins, or transgenic plants able to synthesise such toxins, are described in EP-A-451 878, EP-A-374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, WO 03/052073 and EP-A-427 529.<br>
Examples of transgenic plants comprising one or more genes that code for an insecticidal resistance and express one or more toxins are KnockOut® (maize), Yield Gard® (maize), NuCOTIN33B® (cotton), Bollgard® (cotton), New Leaf® (potatoes), NatureGard® and Protexcta®. Plant crops or seed material thereof can be both resistant to herbicides and, at the same time, resistant to insect feeding ("stacked" transgenic events). For example, seed can have the ability to express an insecticidal Cry3 protein while at the same time being tolerant to glyphosate.<br>
Crops are also to be understood as being those which are obtained by conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering and contain so-called output traits (e.g. improved storage stability, higher nutritional value and improved flavour).<br>
Areas under cultivation include land on which the crop plants are already growing and land intended for cultivation with those crop plants.<br>
If necessary or desired for a particular application or crop, the composition of the present invention may contain an antidotally effective amount of a safener. Safeners are known in the art and many are commercially available.<br>
The present invention is demonstrated but not limited by the following examples.<br>
