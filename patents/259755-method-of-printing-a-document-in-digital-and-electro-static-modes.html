FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral). Specifically the present invention relates to the printer and photo-copier. More particularly the present invention relates to a system and a method to print variable number of copies in digital and electro-static modes.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Japanese Patent no. JP60049377A2 titled "Image Processor" discloses a method and a system that automatically performs both digital printing and electro-static copying, based on the number of copies to be printed. The method described also involves conversion of digital signals into analog signals for electro-static copying. However, the system, as described in the patent publication, does not provide an option to the user to decide on the number of copies for digital printing and electro-static copying.<br>
US Patent no. 4494129 titled "Electrostatic Printing Apparatus" describes an apparatus for converting digital inputs into electro-static output for photocopying. However, the apparatus does not provide an option for printing copies digitally.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is, therefore, to provide the end user an option to print variable number of copies in digital and electro-static modes as per user needs.<br>
The invention describes a system and a method that provides the user an option to print variable number of copies in digital and electro-static modes, as per the user needs, on a Multi-Functional Peripheral (MFP). The user can input the number of copies to be printed digitally and the number of copies to be printed electro-statically through a client module on a computer. The printer first prints the<br><br>
digital scanned page/file and then the output is placed on a Flatbed or Automatic Document Feeder (ADF / DADF) for electro-static copying. The user also has an option of printing all the copies in digital mode. The method of the invention provides a cost benefit to the user by reducing the consumption of toner, as all the copies are not digitally printed.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method to print variable number of prints in digital and electro-static modes comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	inputting the number of copies to be digitally printed and number of prints that need to be electro-statically printed using a client module in a host PC by a user;<br>
(b)	sending the said input information to the MFP in selected printer language;<br>
(c)	parsing and processing the print job command by the MFP; and<br>
(d)	printing the pages digitally as per the input information,<br>
wherein if electro-static print is also selected, after having printed digitally the digital output is placed on a tray and required electro-static prints are taken.<br>
The said tray is the output tray for the digital print which acts as the input tray for the electro-static print. The host machine is adapted to operate by including option to accept the number of electro-static prints apart from normal digital prints and by passing the information to MFP in the print language specified by user. Firmware of the MFP is altered to include support to parse and process the information related to number of digital and number of electro-static prints.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system to print variable number of prints in digital and electro-static modes comprising:<br>
(a)	means for inputting the number of copies to be digitally printed and number of prints that need to be electro-statically printed using a client module in a host PC by a user;<br>
(b)	means for sending the said input information to the MFP in selected printer language;<br>
(c)	means for parsing and processing the print job command by the MFP; and<br><br>
(d) means for printing the pages digitally as per the input information,<br>
wherein if electro-static print is also selected, after having printed digitally the digital output is placed on a tray and required electro-static prints are taken.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a method to copy variable number of copies in digital and electro-static modes comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	inputting the number of copies to be digitally copied and number of copies that need to be electro-statically copied using a Ul at the MFP;<br>
(b)	parsing and processing the copy command by the MFP; and<br>
(c)	copying the pages digitally / electro-statically as per the input information,<br>
wherein if a mixed collate copy is selected,  after having  printed digitally /<br>
electro-statically as per selection   the output is placed on a tray and required<br>
digitally / electro-static copies are taken accordingly.<br>
The copy task which executes the mixed copy command, can complete the copy job by completing an electro-static copy followed by digital or digital copy followed by an electro-static copy. If user gives a mixed collate copy job, first the copies as many specified by user is entirely printed digitally/ electro-statically and the output tray of the digital/ electro-static copies acts as the tray for the remaining copies specified by user. The output tray of the digital/ electro-static copies acts as the tray for the remaining copies specified by user based on whether the said copy is a double side or single side collate copy.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system to copy variable number of copies in digital and electro-static modes comprising:<br>
(a)	means for inputting the number of copies to be digitally copied and number of copies that need to be electro-statically copied using a Ul at the MFP;<br>
(b)	means for parsing and processing the copy command by the MFP; and<br>
(c)	means for copying the pages digitally / electro-statically as per the input information,<br>
wherein if a mixed collate copy is selected,  after having  printed digitally /<br><br>
electro-statically as per selection the output is placed on a tray and required digitally / electro-static copies are taken accordingly.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The objective of the proposed invention is to generate a single copy (or as many copies as required) digitally and the rest electro-statically printed.  The said<br><br>
invention is applicable to the PRINT/COPY operations.<br>
Now the changes for supporting a mixed PRINT (digital+analog) operation will be explained in detail.<br>
Figure 1 explains the typical job flow in MFP:<br>
1.	Through the Host PC the user is requested to INPUT the number of copies of the print job he needs<br>
2.	User then fires a print<br>
3.	The given job is stored in the RAM/FLASH memory before submitting the same to printer engine<br>
4.	Printer engine then provides the job to the print hardware which prints the requested number of pages of the job<br>
To support the mixed PRINT operation i.e. combinational analog and digital Printing, changes in hardware as given in the figure 5 are required.<br>
The required changes are explained in more detail below.<br>
1.	2 bits in any General purpose register to indicate the PRINT operation. 1 of the bits would represent the digital PRINT and the other will indicate the analog PRINT. The digital PRINT bit would be set to HIGH as long as the digital PRINTS are in progress and will be set to LOW once it is complete. Vice versa for the analog PRINT.<br>
2.	2 separate scanner beds. The analog scanner bed would be on top of the existing digital scanner beds on digital printers. Upon completion of the digital PRINT, the Output tray of the digital PRINT will act as the Input tray for the analog scanner bed.<br>
NOTE: Scanner units currently available in market can be used for the analog and digital scanning. There is no need for extra changes to accommodate the mixed PRINT/COPY.<br>
3.	2 rollers to place the output of the digital PRINT onto the analog scanner<br>
bed.<br><br>
Again, rollers already available in market and being used in contemporary printers can be used.<br>
Application changes include a provision to the user to enter the number of copies he needs in digital and analog for the PRINT job. Refer to the changes encircled in the figure 2. A simple textbox is provided in the properties dialog box to enter the specific number of analog and digital copies.<br>
Changes to driver on HOST machine include option to accept the number of analog copies apart from normal digital copies and passing the information to MFP in the print language specified by user.<br>
Changes in Firmware include support to parse and process the information related to number of digital and number of analog copies. More specifically, when a pcl/pjl is received from the Host machine, the print command language(pcl) command is parsed to check the total number of analog and digital copies required. Based on the above information the bits in the General purpose register are SET to indicate a MIXED PRINT operation.<br>
After completion of the digital prints, the bit corresponding to the same is turned off. After analog prints are completed, the printer engine firmware turns of the analog bit as well in the GP register.<br>
To summarize, the overall procedure for a mixed PRINT operation (analog + digital) is explained in the steps below (refer to Figure 3):<br>
1.	Through a client application on Host PC the user is requested to INPUT the number of copies (digitally printed), no. of copies that need to be electro-statically printed.<br>
2.	The driver transparently sends this information to the MFP in selected printer language<br>
3.	Firmware parses and processes the PRINT job command.<br><br>
4.	In the BEST case only a single digital copy needs to be printed.<br>
5.	If electro-static print is also selected by USER, after having printed the digital scanned page/file, the hardware/firmware design should be in such a fashion that ONE of the digital OUTPUT is placed on the FLATBED/ADF/DADF for electro-static print.<br>
6.	Print the required electro-static copies<br>
Figure 4 explains the data flow in the system with the proposed approach. The user first input the number of copies to be printed digitally and the number of copies to be printed electro-statically through a client module on a computer where the printer first prints the digital scanned page/file and then the output is placed on a tray for electro-static copying. If electro-static print is also selected by user, after having printed the digital scanned page/file, one of the digital output is placed on the tray for electro-static print. The said data flow ends when the said number of electro-static copies are taken by the MFP.<br>
The operation for mixed COPY command is very similar to the mixed PRINT command. No changes are required at the HOST end as COPY operation is always issued directly at the MFP. Hence, changes are required only at the MFP end. Ul changes include menu option to specify the number of analog and digital copies required. The Ul changes also can be supported with direct keys to enter the number of digital and analog copies.<br>
The hardware changes to support mixed COPY operation are the same as the mixed PRINT operation. Hence, 2 bits are set upon initiating a mixed COPY operation. The bits are turned off by the firmware once the respective copies are completed. The same scanner beds as used with mixed PRINT operation - analog scanner bed unit on top the digital scanner bed are used for mixed COPY as well.<br>
Thus, the COPY task which executes the mixed COPY command completes the digital COPY first followed by analog copies of the page/job. In the case where user gives a mixed collate COPY job, the first set or as many specified by user is entirely<br><br>
printed (BEST case) digitally followed by analog copies.<br>
The 2 rollers at the Output tray of the digital copies enable placing the digital normal/collated copy output to the analog scanner unit. Based on marketing strategies, the analog scanner unit on top of the digital scanner unit can support both ADF and DADF or only ADF.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br>
