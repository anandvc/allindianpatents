CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This   application   claims   the   benefit   of   U.S.    Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/916,456, filed on May 7, 2007.  The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] This application relates to a multiple speed transmission having<br>
a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices and<br>
more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds, four planetary<br>
gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A transmission is provided having an input member, an output<br>
member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and a plurality<br>
of torque transmitting devices. Each of the planetary gear sets includes first,<br>
second and third members. The torque transmitting devices are for example<br>
clutches.<br>
[0007] One embodiment of the transmission of the present invention<br>
includes an input member, an output member, first, second, third and fourth<br>
planetary gear sets each having first, second and third members. A first<br>
interconnecting member continuously interconnects the third member of the first<br>
planetary gear set with a stationary element. A second interconnecting member<br>
continuously interconnects the first member of the second planetary gear set with<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is intended to be exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses of the<br>
present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0026] It should be appreciated that embodiments of the eight speed<br>
automatic transmission of the present invention have an arrangement of<br>
permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary<br>
gear sets in common. A first component or element of a first planetary gear set<br>
is permanently coupled to a ground. A first component or element of a second<br>
planetary gear set is also permanently coupled to the ground. A second<br>
component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled<br>
to a second component or element of a third planetary gear set. Furthermore,<br>
the second component or element of the second planetary gear set is also<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of a fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br><br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches are presented as interleaved<br>
fingers. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0028] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br><br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0029] The input 12 is coupled to the second node 18B of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The output is coupled to the second node 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14. The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to a ground or transmission housing 30. The first node 16A of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 is also coupled to the ground or the transmission<br>
housing 30. The second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is<br>
coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The second node<br>
16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is further coupled to the first node 20A<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0030] A first clutch 24 selectively connects the second node 18B of<br>
the third planetary gear set 18 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 20. A second clutch 26 selectively connects the third node 18C of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A<br>
third clutch 28 selectively connects the third node 18C of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18 to the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14. A fourth clutch 32<br>
selectively connects the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 to<br>
the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A fifth clutch 34<br>
selectively connects the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to<br>
the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14.<br>
[0031] Referring to Figure 2, a stick diagram illustrates a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 in accordance with<br><br>
the present disclosure. In Figure 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of<br>
Figure 1 is carried over. The clutches and couplings are correspondingly<br>
presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as<br>
components of planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears<br>
and planet gear carriers.<br>
[0032] For example, planetary gear set 14 is a planetary gear set that<br>
includes a sun gear member 14C, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a ring<br>
gear member 14A. Ring gear member 14A is connected for common rotation<br>
with a first shaft or interconnecting member 36 which is fixed to the ground or<br>
transmission housing 30. Sun gear member 14C is connected for a common<br>
rotation with a second shaft or interconnecting member 38. The planet gear<br>
carrier 14B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D and is connected for<br>
common rotation with a third shaft or interconnecting member 40 and the output<br>
22. The planet gears 14D are configured to intermesh with the sun gear member<br>
14C and the ring gear member 14A.<br>
[0033] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output shaft or<br>
member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer case<br>
(not shown).<br>
[0034] Planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 16A, a planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 16D and a ring gear member 16C. Sun gear member 16A is<br>
connected to a fourth shaft or interconnecting member 42 which is connected to<br><br>
ground to prevent rotation of sun gear number 16A. Planet carrier member 16B<br>
is connected for common rotation with a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 44.<br>
Ring gear member 16C is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting 46. Planet gears 16D are configured to intermesh with both the<br>
sun gear member 16A and the ring gear member 16C.<br>
[0035] Planetary gear set 18 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 18C, a planet carrier member 18B and a ring gear member 18A.<br>
Sun gear member 18C is connected for common rotation with a seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 48. Planet carrier member 18B is connected to the<br>
input 12 and to an eighth shaft or interconnecting member 50. Ring gear<br>
member 18A is connected for common rotation with the fifth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 44. Planet gears 18D are configured to intermesh with<br>
both the sun gear member 18C and the ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0036] Planetary gear set 20 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 20A, a planet carrier member 20B and a ring gear member 20C.<br>
Sun gear member 20A is connected for common rotation with the fifth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 44. Ring gear member 20C is connected for common<br>
rotation with a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 52. Planet carrier member<br>
20B is connected for common rotation with the tenth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 54. Planet gears 20D are configured to intermesh with both the sun<br>
gear member 20A and the ring gear member 20C.<br>
[0037] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 24, 26, 28, 32<br>
and  34  allow for selective  interconnection  of the  shafts  or  interconnecting<br><br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
the first clutch 24 is selectively engageable to connect the eighth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 50 to the ninth shaft or interconnecting member 52. The<br>
second clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 48 to the ninth shaft or interconnecting member 52. The<br>
third clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 48 to the second shaft or interconnecting member 38.<br>
The fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect the sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 46 to the tenth shaft or interconnecting member 54. The<br>
fifth clutch 34 is selectively engageable to connect the tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54 to the third shaft or interconnecting member 40.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Figure 2 and to Figure 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or<br>
more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 24, second clutch<br>
26, third clutch 28, fourth clutch 32, and fifth clutch 34), as will be explained<br>
below. Figure 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to achieve the various<br>
gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also<br>
presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are<br><br>
exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to<br>
accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
10. Examples of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of<br>
the present disclosure are also shown in Figure 3. Of course, other gear ratios<br>
are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br>
[0039] To establish reverse gear, the second clutch 26, the third clutch<br>
28 and the fifth clutch 34 are engaged or activated. As previously asserted in the<br>
disclosure, the second clutch 26 connects the seventh shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 48 to the ninth shaft or interconnecting member 52. The third clutch 28<br>
connects the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 48 to the second shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 38. The fifth clutch 34 connects the tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54 to the third shaft or interconnecting member 40.<br>
[0040] It should be appreciated that the foregoing expl anation of<br>
operation and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all,<br>
that all the clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive<br>
or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear<br>
state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch engaged or activated in<br>
both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0041] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
