				<td>RING SEAL WITH INNER LIP<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present disclosure relates to ring seals, and more<br>
particularly to a ring seal with an inner lip.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003]	There are many applications where a seal is required between a<br>
rotating component and a stationary component, such as in a transmission or an<br>
engine. Typically, a ring seal is used to seal the rotating component to the<br>
stationary component in order to keep fluids on either side of the ring seal from<br>
escaping to the other side. The ring seal typically includes a circular member<br>
that fits around the stationary component and an outer surface that engages the<br>
surface of the rotating component. One complication of the above described ring<br>
seal is that the ring seal must remain stationary relative to the rotating<br>
component while still maintaining an effective seal to the rotating component. In<br>
this regard, the typical ring seal must keep friction forces between the ring seal<br>
and the rotating component to a minimum while still maintaining enough radial<br>
force to keep fluid from moving past the ring seal.<br>
[0004]	One solution known in the art to keeping these radial friction<br>
forces to a minimum is to force the ring seal to move in an axial direction against<br>
1<br><br>
a tab or groove formed on the stationary component. By using axial forces,<br>
radial forces can be kept to a minimum. Axial forces typically originate from a<br>
pressure differential of the fluid on each side of the ring seal. As the pressure<br>
differential changes from one side of the ring seal to the other, the ring seal is<br>
able to move from one position sealed against the stationary component to a<br>
second position sealed against the stationary component.<br>
[0005]	However, during the transition between positions, there can be<br>
leakage of the fluid around the seal. One solution known in the art is to provide a<br>
second ring between the ring seal and one of the components. While effective<br>
for its intended purpose, the second ring can increase the radial forces of the ring<br>
seal, thereby increasing friction between the ring seal and the rotating element.<br>
Moreover, the second ring increases assembly costs. Therefore, there is room in<br>
the art for a ring seal that minimizes fluid leakage across the seal during<br>
transition while simultaneously providing a construction that does not increase<br>
assembly costs.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	In an aspect of the present invention a device for sealing<br>
between a first component and a second component is provided, the first<br>
component having a groove formed therein, the groove having a first wall and a<br>
second wall.<br>
[0007]	In one aspect of the present invention, the device includes an<br>
annular body having a first side configured to selectively contact the first wall of<br>

the groove, a second side opposite the first side, wherein the second side is<br>
configured to selectively contact the second wall of the groove, a first surface in<br>
contact with the second component, and a second surface opposite the first<br>
surface. A lip is bonded to the second surface and extends at least partially<br>
around the second surface of the annular body. A pressure acting on the first<br>
side of the annular body forces the second side to contact the second wall of the<br>
groove, and a pressure acting on the second side of the annular body forces the<br>
first side to contact the first wall of the groove.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect of the present invention, the first surface is an<br>
outer surface of the annular body.<br>
[0009]	In yet another aspect of the present invention, the second<br>

contact the groove.<br>
[0017]	In still another aspect of the present invention, the lip has a<br>
width less than a width of the annular body.<br>
[0018]	In a second embodiment of the present invention, the device<br>
includes an annular body having a first side configured to selectively contact the<br>
first wall of the groove, a second side opposite the first side, wherein the second<br>
side is configured to selectively contact the second wall of the groove, an outer<br>
surface in contact with the second component, and an inner surface. A lip is<br>
adjacent to the inner surface and extends at least partially around the inner<br>
surface of the annular body. A pressure acting on the first side of the annular<br>
body and the lip forces the second side to contact the second wall of the groove,<br>
and a pressure acting on the second side of the annular body forces the first side<br>
to contact the first wall of the groove.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0034]	The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0035]	FIG. 1 illustrates a ring seal 10 designed according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. The ring seal 10 includes an annular body 12.<br>
The annular body 12 is generally circular in shape and includes an inner surface<br>
14 and an outer surface 16. A plurality of tab members 18 extend from the<br>
annular body radially inward. In the particular example provided, there are two<br>
tab members 18 spaced diametrically opposite one another on the annular body<br>
12, but it should be appreciated that any number of tab members 18 may be<br>
employed at any location along the annular body 12. The tab members 18 are<br>
6<br><br>
sized to engage slots (not shown) on a component 34 (FIG.'s 2 and 3) in order to<br>
prevent the ring seal 10 from rotating. The annular body 12 further includes a<br>
step joint 20 formed therein. The step joint 20 allows the annular body 12 to<br>
expand to maintain its sealing characteristics.<br>
[0036]	The ring seal 10 further includes a lip 22 adjacent to the inner<br>
surface 14 of the annular body 12. In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the lip 22 is bonded to the annular body 12, though various other<br>
methods of coupling the lip 22 to the annular body 12 may be employed. For<br>
example, the lip 22 may be formed directly from the annular body 12 as a unitary<br>
piece. The lip 22 extends along the inner circumference of the annular body 12<br>
and is generally circular in shape. The lip 22 includes three segments including a<br>
first segment 22a, a second segment 22b, and a third segment 22c. The first<br>
segment 22a is disposed between one of the tab members 18 and the step joint<br>
20. The second segment 22b is disposed between another of the tab members<br>
18 and the step joint 20. The third segment 22c is disposed between the two tab<br>
members 18. In this regard, the first segment 22a and the second segment 22b<br>
span arcs approximately equal to 90 degrees while the third segment 22c spans<br>
an arc approximately equal to 180 degrees. However, it should be appreciated<br>
that the lip 22 may extend around the inner circumference of the annular body 12<br>
without interruption or in various other configurations without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
[0037]	With reference to FIG. 2, an enlarged cross-sectional view of<br>
the ring seal 10 in the direction of arrow 2-2 in FIG. 1 is shown. The annular<br>
7<br><br>
body 12 of the ring seal 10 further includes a first side 24 and a second side 26.<br>
The first side 24 is opposite the second side 26. The lip 22 is bonded to the inner<br>
surface 14, as noted above, and has a width less than a width of the annular<br>
body 12. The lip 22 is preferably spaced equidistant between the first side 24<br>
and the second side 26, however the lip 22 may be disposed asymmetrically with<br>
respect to the first side 24 and the second side 26.<br>
[0038]	The lip 22 includes a first face 28, a second face 30 opposite<br>
the first face 28, and a bottom 32 that extends between the first face 28 and the<br>
second face 30. In the preferred embodiment, the first face 28 and the second<br>
face 30 slope towards one another, but it should be appreciated that the first face<br>
28 and second face 30 may be parallel to one another or form a trapezoidal or<br>
other asymmetrical shape.<br>
[0039]	The annular body 12 is made from a hard plastic, such as, for<br>
example, a glass-filled plastic. The lip 22 is made from a flexible rubber and, as<br>
noted above, is preferably bonded to the annular body 12. It should be<br>
appreciated that other materials may be used to construct the annular body 12<br>
and the lip 22 so long as the basic properties of the preferred embodiment are<br>
preserved.<br>
[0040]	Turning now to FIG. 3A, the ring seal 10 is illustrated in use with<br>
a first component 34 and a second component 36. The first component includes<br>
a groove 38 formed therein. The groove includes a first wall 40, a second wall 42<br>
opposite the first wall 40, and a base 44 extending between the first wall 40 and<br>
8<br><br>
the second wall 42. The groove 38 has a width greater than a width of the ring<br>
seal 10.<br>
[0041]	The first component 34 and the second component 36 are<br>
positioned proximate to each other. In the particular example provided, the first<br>
component 34 is stationary and the second component 36 is rotatable with<br>
respect to the first component 34. However, it should be appreciated that either<br>
component 34, 36 may be stationary and either component 34, 36 may be<br>
moveable, whether through rotation or translation relative to one another.<br>
[0042]	The ring seal 10 is disposed between the first component 34<br>
and the second component 36 such that the annular body 12 extends at least<br>
partially within the groove 38. The lip 22 is disposed within the groove 38 but<br>
does not contact the first wall 40, the second wall 42, nor does it necessarily<br>
contact the base 44 of the groove 38. The outer surface 16 of the annular body<br>
12 is in contact with the second component 36. This contact between the outer<br>
surface 16 and the second component 36 acts as a seal and limits fluid from<br>
passing between the outer surface 16 and the second component 36. The outer<br>
surface 16 is preferably smooth to allow rotation of the second component 36<br>
with respect to the ring seal 10.<br>
[0043]	The ring seal 10 is moveable between a first position, illustrated<br>
in FIG. 3A, and a second position, illustrated in FIG. 3B. Specifically, pressurized<br>
fluid (not specifically shown) on either side of the ring seal 10 acts on the ring<br>
seal 10. When there is a sufficiently large pressure differential between the fluid<br>
on either side of the ring seal 10, the ring seal 10 transitions within the groove 38<br>
9<br><br>
and contacts one of the walls 40, 42 to limit fluid from passing between the ring<br>
seal 10 and the first component 34.<br>
[0044]	In the first position shown in FIG. 3A, fluid pressure (indicated<br>
by the arrows) acts on the first side 24 of the annular body 12 and acts on the<br>
first face 28 of the lip 22. Fluid pressure provides a force which moves the ring<br>
seal 10 within the groove 38 such that the second side 26 of the ring seal 10<br>
contacts the second wall 42 of the groove 38. This contact acts as a seal and<br>
limits fluid from passing between the second side 26 of the ring seal 10 and the<br>
second wall 42 of the groove 38. By concentrating the sealing forces in a lateral<br>
direction rather than a radial direction, the friction between the outer surface 16<br>
of the ring seal 10 and the second component 36 is not significantly increased.<br>
[0045]	In the second position shown in FIG. 3B, fluid pressure<br>
(indicated by the arrows) acts on the second side 26 of the annular body 12 and<br>
acts on the second face 30 of the lip 22. Fluid pressure provides a force which<br>
moves the ring seal 10 within the groove 38 such that the first side 24 of the ring<br>
seal 10 contacts the first wall 40 of the groove 38. This contact acts as a seal<br>
and limits fluid from passing between the first side 24 of the ring seal 10 and the<br>
first wall 40 of the groove 38. By keeping the sealing forces in a lateral direction<br>
rather than a radial direction, the friction between the outer surface 16 of the ring<br>
seal 10 and the second component 36 is again not significantly increased.<br>
[0046]	As noted above, a change in the pressure differential acting on<br>
the ring seal 10 will cause the ring seal 10 to move between the first position<br>
(shown in FIG. 3A) and the second position (shown in FIG. 3B). During this<br>
10<br><br>
transition, fluid can leak between the ring seal 10 and the first component 34.<br>
The lip 22 in this regard acts like a dam to reduce the amount of leakage during<br>
the transition between the first position and the second position by reducing the<br>
volume between the annular body 12 and the groove 38. Moreover, by limiting<br>
the amount of leakage of the fluid during transition, the lip 22 helps maintain a<br>
higher pressure differential on either side of the ring seal 10. This higher<br>
pressure differential means the force acting on the ring seal 10 is greater, which<br>
in turn means the ring seal 10 makes the transition between the first position and<br>
the second position rapidly, thus further reducing the leakage. In addition, the<br>
flexibility of the lip 22 prevents large increases in frictional forces if the lip 22<br>
contacts the first component 34 as the lip 22 will flex or compress, thereby<br>
absorbing much of the radial force.<br>
[0047]	The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

than the first segment and the second segment.<br><br><br>
A device for sealing between a first component and a second component is disclosed. The first component has a groove and the groove has a<br>
first wall and a second wall. The annular body includes a first side configured to<br>
selectively contact the first wall of the groove, a second side opposite the first<br>
side configured to selectively contact the second wall of the groove, a first<br>
surface in contact with the second component, and a second surface opposite<br>
the first surface. A lip is bonded to the second surface and extends at least partially around the second surface of the annular body. A pressure acting on the first side of the annular body forces the second side to contact the second<br>
wall of the groove, and a pressure acting on the second side of the annular body forces the first side to contact the first wall of the groove.<br></td>
