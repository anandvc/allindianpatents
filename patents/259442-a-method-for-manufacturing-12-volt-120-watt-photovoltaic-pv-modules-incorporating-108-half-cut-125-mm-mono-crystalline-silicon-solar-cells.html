FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for fabrication of Photovoltaic (PV) modules of<br>
rating 12-volt, 120-watt incorporating 108 half-cut, 125-mm size mono crystalline<br>
silicon solar cells. The conventional 12-volt, 120-watt PV module incorporates 36<br>
nos. of 156-mm size mono / multi-crystalline silicon solar cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Worldwide, there is a shift in PV module ratings from lower to higher power<br>
output. This is evidenced by the spurt in demand for higher-wattage modules<br>
for applications in stand-alone PV systems such as street lighting, domestic<br>
lighting as well as large Power Plants. Photovoltaic manufacturers have<br>
commercialized higher-rating PV modules with accompanying advantages of<br>
increased production throughput with high efficiency solar cells, improved system<br>
reliability and reduced maintenance cost.<br>
The standard large power rating modules are; a) 160 to 185 watts manufactured<br>
using 72 nos. (24-V application) of 156-mm size solar cells, b) 120 to 130-watt<br>
modules manufactured using 36 nos. (12-V application) of 156-mm size solar<br>
cells. Solar ceil size is a constraint for manufacturing 120-watt PV modules by<br>
manufacturers whose line can handle only 125-mm size wafers. To facilitate<br>
manufacture of 12-Volt, 120-watt PV modules using 125-mm size solar cells, an<br>
alternative design is required to be formulated. This invention is a configuration<br>
using 108 half-cut 125-mm size solar cells in series-parallel configuration. The<br><br>
design concepts employed in manufacturing were: Production of high-efficiency<br>
(Η = 15 %) solar cells using alkaline texturisation, diffusion, plasma edge junction<br>
removal, silicon-nitride anti-reflection coating, screen printing and firing. A<br>
graded- refractive index silicon nitride layer was deposited in-situ using Plasma<br>
Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) tube furnace process and a<br>
Back Surface Field (BSF) metalisation process applied to improve solar cell<br>
conversion efficiency; Design of suitable layout of PV modules and fabrication of<br>
the anodized aluminium frame with a special cross section for two screws at<br>
each corner and width of 50 mm for assembling and providing rigidity to the<br>
modules. The modules have been fitted with a junction box and clip-on<br>
connector cables.<br>

Introduction :<br>
Worldwide, there is a shift in PV module ratings from lower to higher power<br>
output. This is evidenced by the spurt in demand for higher-wattage modules for<br>
applications in stand-alone PV systems such as street lighting, domestic lighting<br>
as well as large Power Plants. Photovoltaic manufacturers have commercialized<br>
higher-rating PV modules with accompanying advantages of increased<br>
production throughput with high efficiency solar cells, improved system reliability<br>
and reduced maintenance cost.<br>
The standard large power rating modules are ; a) 160 to 185 watts manufactured<br>
using 72 nos. (24-V application) of 125-mm size solar cells, b) 120 to 130-watt<br>
modules manufactured using 36 nos. (12-V application) of 156-mm size solar<br>
cells. Solar cell size is a constraint for manufacturing 120-watt PV modules by<br>
manufacturers whose line can handle only 125-mm size wafers. To facilitate<br>
manufacture of 12-volt, 120-watt PV modules using 125-mm size solar cells, an<br>
alternative design has been considered. This configuration uses 108 half- cut,<br>
125-mm size solar cells in series-parallel configuration. The design concepts<br><br>
employed in manufacturing were, production of high-efficiency (η = 15 %) solar<br>
cells using alkaline texturisation, diffusion, plasma edge junction removal, silicon-<br>
nitride anti-reflection coating, screen printing and firing. A graded-refractive<br>
index silicon nitride layer was deposited in-situ using Plasma Enhanced<br>
Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) tube furnace process and a Back Surface<br>
Field (BSF) metalisation process applied to improve solar cell conversion<br>
efficiency. Anodized aluminium frame with a special cross section for two screws<br>
at each corner and width of 50 mm was used for assembling and providing<br>
rigidity to the modules. The modules have been fitted with a junction box and<br>
clip-on connector cables.<br>
Design and development:<br>
The process flow chart of solar cell is as given in Fig. 1. The process steps<br>
include the following :<br>
1.	Saw damage removal and texturisation<br>
2.	p-n junction formation by thermal diffusion<br>
3.	Edge junction removal by plasma etching<br>
4.	Phosphorous Silicate Glass (PSG) removal<br>
5.	Silicon Nitride Anti-Reflection Coating (ARC) by Plasma Enhanced<br>
Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD).<br>
6.	Metalisation and firing of contacts<br>
7.	Testing and classification of Solar Cells.<br>
The as-cut p-type boron-doped CZ silicon wafers are chemically etched in<br>
concentrated alkali solution to remove saw damages followed by a dilute alkali<br><br>
texturising step to form pyramid-like structures on the wafer. Process<br>
parameters such as alkali concentration, solution temperature and process time<br>
are optimised to get well-defined normal random pyramids which enhance the<br>
surface area of the wafer for greater light absorption and at the same time,<br>
facilitate total internal reflection of light.<br>
A p-n junction is then formed on the textured silicon wafer through a high-<br>
temperature, solid- state diffusion process in a quartz furnace. In this process,<br>
phosphorous oxy-chloride (POCI3) liquid dopant is deposited on the wafers and is<br>
driven in when a thin n-type layer is formed. The wafers are coin-staked and<br>
etched using freon-oxygen gas mixture in a dry plasma etch machine so as to<br>
remove the junction regions created on the edges. The wafers are then<br>
chemically etched to remove the oxides and phosphorous glass from the surface.<br>
A thin film of silicon nitride (anti-reflection coating) is deposited on the wafer to<br>
lower the reflection of light further and to passivate the solar cell against harmful<br>
environment such as humidity, ionizing radiation and reactive module lamination<br>
materials. The silicon nitride anti-reflection coating enhances the solar cell<br>
conversion efficiency by almost 1 %.<br>
Front and back contacts on the wafer surface are established by screen printing<br>
a suitable metallic pastes on them. A fine-line grid pattern (Silver) is formed on<br>
the front side which is designed to reduce the contact resistance and at the same<br>
time increase the aperture for light absorption. Busbars (Silver-aluminium) are<br>
printed on the back side for facilitating solder contacts, and rest of the area is<br>
covered with aluminium paste to create the back surface field (BSF). The printed<br>
pastes are dried and sintered in an infra-red belt furnace where temperature and<br>
belt speed are optimized to achieve a sharp temperature profile. The cells are<br><br>
then tested under illuminated light and classified into various bins as per the<br>
power output.<br>
The flow chart of PV module fabrication process is shown in Fig. 2. The<br>
process steps include the following:<br>
1.	Interconnection of solar cells and formation of a string.<br>
2.	Lamination of the interconnected solar cells and curing.<br>
3.	Framing and junction box fixing<br>
4.	Testing with a Sun Simulator<br>
Tinned copper interconnects are soldered on the front busbars of matched solar<br>
cells in terms of output current. These are strung together (front contact of one<br>
cell connected to the back contact of the next cell through the interconnects) in a<br>
specially designed lay-up jig, terminating in positive and negative output leads.<br>
The strung solar cell array is sandwiched between a layer of Ethylene Vinyl<br>
Acetate (EVA, a thermo plastic resin formulated with cross-linking additives) and<br>
a tempered glass superstrate with high transmission (91%) and low iron content<br>
on one side and a similar EVA layer and a Tedlar-Polyester-Tedlar PVF film as a<br>
substrate on the other. The entire assembly is bonded within a specially<br>
designed and developed vacuum laminator at high temperature and in vacuum.<br>
During this process, the EVA film melts and forms a bond between solar cells<br>
and glass on one side and solar cells and Tedlar on the other. This makes the<br>
assembly resistant to moisture and environmental effects. The laminate is framed<br>
with anodised aluminium edge frames so as to provide support and flexibility in<br>
mounting the PV modules at site as well as providing strength against high wind<br><br>
velocity. A junction box is provided for enabling the PV modules to be<br>
interconnected in an array and to the load. The module is then tested under<br>
simulated light for measuring the electrical power output.<br>
Conventional 12-V, 120-W PV modules (Fig. 3) manufactured with 156-mm solar<br>
cells (36 cells of 3.3 to 3.4-watt in 9*4 configuration) have the overall dimension<br>
of 1476*660*50 mm3 with following electrical characteristics:<br>
Open-circuit voltage (Voc) : 22 V, Short-circuit current (lsc) : 7.5 A<br>
Voltage at maximum power point (Vmp) : 17.5 V, Current at maximum power point<br>
(Up): 6.9A.<br>
The power output of 125-mm mono-crystalline or multi-crystalline solar cells<br>
range from 2.2 to as high as 2.5-watt. A typical module made with 36-nos. of<br>
125-mm size solar cells (each of 2.3-watt) produces 80-watt power output.<br>
Similarly, a module fabricated with 36-nos. of 125-mm half cut solar cells<br>
produces a power output of 40 watts. It is derived that three 40-watt modules are<br>
required to be paralleled to realize 120 watts for 12-volt application. This concept<br>
is used here for manufacture of 12-V, 120-W modules using 108 half-cut solar<br>
cells. A picture of full and half-cut 125-mm mono pseudo square silicon solar cell<br>
is shown in Fig. 4. 3 strings each of 18 half-cut cells are paralleled and then<br>
connected in series with another set of 18*3 strings to realize the open-circuit<br>
voltage of 21-Volt, short-circuit current of 7.5-Amp and power output in the range<br>
of 120 to 125 watts. The array design is of 18*6 configuration with an overall<br>
module size of 1239*789*50 mm3. The specially developed lay-up jig and the<br>
laminated 120-watt module are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively.<br><br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Few PV modules of the present design have been manufactured using 108-nos.<br>
of 125-mm half cut high efficiency solar cells. Characteristics of a typical module<br>
measured using a Sun Simulator (Spire, 460i) are as given below.<br><br>
These newly developed PV modules have met the design specification of voltage<br>
and power adequately. The current-voltage characteristics as measured using<br>
Sun Simulator is given in Fig. 7. The total area of the module remain almost<br>
same as that made with 36-cell (156-mm size) configuration. Out door<br>
performance tests have been carried out and the initial results indicate that the<br>
performance stability of these modules are well within acceptable limits, as<br>
already observed in the case of generic modules using similar solar cells.<br><br>
