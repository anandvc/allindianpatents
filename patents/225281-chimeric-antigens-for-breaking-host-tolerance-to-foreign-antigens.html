VIREXX MEDICAL CORP., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF CANADA, WHOSE ADDRUGG IS 8223 ROPER ROAD, EDMONTON, ALBERTA T6E 6S4, CANADA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
I.        INTRODUCTION<br>
A.	Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/493,449, filed August 8,2003, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
B.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for eliciting or enhancing an immune response and for breaking host tolerance to foreign antigens.<br>
C.	Background<br>
When a healthy host (human or animal) encounters a foreign antigen, such as a protein derived from a bacterium, virus and/or parasite, the host normally initiates an immune response. This immune response can be a humoral response and/or a cellular response. In the humoral response, antibodies are produced by B cells and are secreted into the blood and/or lymph in response to an antigenic stimulus. The antibody then neutralizes the antigen, e.g. a virus, by binding specifically to antigens on its surface, marking it for destruction by phagocytotic cells and/or complement-mediated mechanisms, or by blocking binding or by enhancing clearance of free antigen from circulation. The cellular response is characterized by the selection and expansion of specific helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes capable of directly or indirectly eliminating the cells that contain the antigen.<br>
In some individuals, the immune system Tails to respond to certain foreign antigens. When an antigen does not stimulate the production of specific antibodies and/or killer T cells, the immune system is unable to prevent the resultant disease. Thus, the infectious agent, e.g. a virus, can establish a chronic infection and die host immune system becomes tolerant to the antigens produced by the infectious agent<br>
While the mechanism by which the infectious agent evades the host immune machinery is not clearly established, the lack of proper presentation of foreign antigens to the host immune system may be a contributing factor to development of<br>
2<br><br>
chronic infections. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) process the encountered antigens differently depending on the localization of the antigen. Exogenous antigens are endocytosed and subsequently processed within the endosomes of the antigen presenting cell. The peptide fragments generated from exogenous antigens are presented on the surface of the cell complexed with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II. The presentation of this complex to CD4+ T cells stimulates the CD4 T helper cells to secrete cytokines that stimulate B cells to produce antibodies against the exogenous antigen (humoral response). Intracellular antigens, on the other hand, are processed and presented as complexes with MHC Class I on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells results in a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) immune response against host cells that carry the antigen.<br>
In subjects with chronic viral or parasitic infections (where the organism is resident inside a host cell at some point during its life cycle), antigens will be produced by and expressed in the host cell and secreted antigens will be present in the circulation. As an example, in the case of a chronic human hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier, virions and the HBV surface antigens and a surrogate of core antigens (in the form of the e-antigen) can be detected in the blood.<br>
An effective therapy for a chronic infection requires a strong CTL response against antigens associated with the infectious agent. This can be achieved either by producing the antigen within the host cell, or delivering the antigen 10 the appropriate cellular compartment so that it gets processed and presented so as to elicit a cellular response. Several approaches have been documented in the literature to deliver an antigen intracellularly. Among these, viral vectors (Lorenz et al., Hum. Gen. Titer. 10:623-631 (1999)), the use of cDNA-transfected cells (Donnelly et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 15:617(1997)) as well as the expression of the antigen through injected cDNA vectors (Lai et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 18:449-484 (1988); and US Patent No. 5,589,466), have been documented. Further, DNA vaccines expressing antigens targeted to dendritic cells have been described (You, et al., Cancer Res 61:3704-3711 (2001)).<br>
Delivery vehicles capable of carrying the antigens to the cytosolic compartment of the cell for MHC Class I pathway processing have also been used. Hilgers, et al. (Vaccine 17: 219-228 (1999)) have described in detail the use of<br>
3<br><br>
adjuvants to achieve he same goal. Another approach is the use of biodegradable microspheres for cytoplasmic delivery of antigens, exemplified by the generation of a Thl immune response against ovalbumin peptide (Newman, et al., J Control Release 54:49-59 (1998); and Newman, et al., J Biomed Mater Res 50:591-597 (2000)). f Additionally, antigen presenting cells, e.g., dendritic cells, take up PLGA nanospheres (Newman, et al., J Bio ned Mater Res 60:480-486 (2002)).<br>
The ability of cendritic cells to capture, process, and present the antigen and to stimulate niive T cells has made them very important tools for therapeutic vaccine development (Laupezt;, et al, Hum Immunol 60:591-597 (1999)). Targeting of the antigen to the dendritic cells is a crucial step in antigen presentation and the presence of several receptors on dendritic cells for the Fc region of antibodies have been exploited for this purpose (Regnault, et al., / Exp Med 189:371-380 (1999)). Additional examples of this approach include ovarian cancer Mab-B43.13, Anti-PSA antibody as well as Anti-HBV antibody antigen complexes (Wen, et al., Int Rev Immunol 18:251-258 (1999)). Cancer immunotherapy using dendritic cells loaded with tumor associated antigens has been shown to produce tumor-specific immune responses and anti-tumor activity (Fong and Engleman, Ann Rev Immunol 96:1865-1972 (2000); and Campton, et al. J Invest Dermatol 115:57-61 (2000)). Promising results were obtained in clinical trials in vivo using tumor-antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (Tarte and Klein, Leukemia 13:653-663 (1999)). These studies clearly demonstrate tne efficacy of using dendritic cells to generate immune responses against cancer antigens.<br>
Antigen presentation can also be affected via mannose receptors, in place of, or in addition to, utilizing the Fc receptor on antigen presenting cells. The macrophage mannose receptor (MMR), also known as CD206, is expressed on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DC). This molecule is a member of the C-type lectin family of endocytic receptors. Mannosylated antigens can be bound and internalized by CD206. In general, exogenous antigen is thought to be processed and presented primarily through the MHC class II pathway. However, in the case of targeting through CD206, there is evidence that both the MHC class I and class II pathways are involved (Apostolopoulos et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30:1714 (200Q); Apostolopoulos and McKenzie, Curr. Mol. Med. 1:469 (2001); Ramakrishna et al., J. Immunol. 172:2845-2852 (2004)).<br>

Infectious disease and cancer are major public healthcare issues. For example,<br>
i World Health Organization statistics show that more than 2 billion people have been<br>
infected by HBV. Among these, 370 million are chronically infected and, as a result,<br>
have a high probability of developing cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular<br>
carcinoma.   Approximately 170 million people worldwide are chronic carriers of<br>
HCV, for which there is no effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine. The World<br>
Health Organization reports that 10 million people are diagnosed with cancer every<br>
year. Cancer causes 6 million deaths every year, 12% of deaths worldwide. Thus a<br>
need exists for new, therapeutically effective compositions and methods for the<br>
eliciting immune responses against infections and cancer, as well as new methods for<br>
producing such compositions.<br>

C. Novel chimeric Antigens<br>
The invention provides chimeric antigens for eliciting an immune response comprising an immune response domain and a target binding domain, wherein the target binding domain comprises an antibody fragment. In accordance with the present invention, the chimeric antigen, preferably, is capable of binding to a Fc receptor and/or to a macrophage mannose receptor. The antibody fragment can be xenotypic to the host or not xenotypic to the host.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the chimeric antigen is capable of inducing humoral and/or cellular immune responses. The cellular immune response can include a Thl response, a Th2 response, and/or a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. In yet another preferred embodiment, the chimeric antigen elicits a multi-epitopic immune response. The multi-epitopic immune response can include a response to at least one epitope of the immune response domain and/or a response to at least one epitope of the target binding domain. Alternatively, the multi-epitopic response may be limited to a response tc more than one epitope of the immune response domain.<br>
The chimeric antigen of the present invention comprises two portions, namely an immune response domain containing an antigenic sequence (such as a viral antigen), and a target binding domain containing an antibody fragment (FIG.l). In a preferred embodiment, the immune response domain can be linked to the target binding domain by any method known to those of skill in the art. Linkers for linking the immune response domain to the target binding domain can include, but are not<br><br><br>
limited to, covalent peptide linkages, chemical conjugation, leucine zippers and biotin/avidin. In. a preferred embodiment, the immune response domain and target binding domain are cloned as a single fusion protein. The covalent peptide linkage of the fusion protein may comprise additional peptide sequences, such as SRPQGGGS or VRPQGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 1). In yet another preferred embodiment, various immune response domains are biotinyated and the target binding domain is generated with streptavidin as a fusion protein ID facilitate the production of a wide assortment of chimeric antigens. Alternatively, the immune response domain and the target binding domain each can be expressed as a fusion to a leucine zipper moiety, which will cause the two portions of the chimeric antigen to associate upon mixing. Finally, the immune response domain and target binding domains can be expressed separately and then chemically conjugated using methods known to, one of skill in the art. Exemplary • methods include use of protein cross-linkers, such as dimethyl suberimidate, to covaiently attach the two domains.<br>
The immune response domain primarily provides the antigenic portion of the chimeric antigen. The immune response domain comprises at least one antigenic portion of the entity to which an immune response is desired.

In yet another embodiment of the invention, the immune response domain of the chimeric antigen includes 6xHis tag fused to the one or more antigenic portions.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the chimeric antigen is a protein capable of binding to an Fc receptor and/or CD206 on an antigen presenting cell, particularly a dendritic cell, and is subsequently transported into the antigen presenting cell by receptor-mediated uptake. In accordance with the present invention, the presence of an antibody fragment augments the uptake of the chimeric antigen through the Fc receptor on antigen-presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells. By virtue of this specific binding and internalization, the viral antigen is processed and presented as foreign. Thus, an immune response can be effectively elicited to a previously tolerated antigen. The target binding domain comprises an antibody fragment that can be xenotypic to the host or not xenotypic to the host. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody fragment comprises a murine Fc fragment. In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the target binding domain comprises a Fc fragment, a hinge region, and a portion of the CH1 region, and the chimeric antigen comprises a peptide linker suitable for linking the target binding domain to the immune response domain. In another preferred embodiment, the target binding domain comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain fragment, and optionally, further comprises a hinge region. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the heavy chain fragment comprises amino acids, VDKKI (SEQ ID NO: 2) of the CH1 domain and/or part or all of the CH2 and CH3 domains.<br>
As discussed above, antigens that are bound and internalized by CD206 can be presented by both MHC Class I and Class II, thus eliciting both a cellular and humoral immune response. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the chimeric antigen is glycosylated. The immune response domain and/or the target binding domain can be glycosylated. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the chimeric antigen is mannose glycosylated by either high mannose glycosylation or by pauci mannose<br><br>
glycosylation (Jarvis, Virology 310:1 -7 (2003)).<br><br><br>
D. Novel Methods of Utilizing Chimeric Antigens<br>
The invention includes methods of eliciting an immune response comprising administering, to a subject, a composition comprising a chimeric antigen of the invention.<br>
In order to provide efficient presentation of the antigens, the inventors have developed a novel chimeric antigen comprising an immune response domain and a target binding domain, wherein the target binding domain comprises an antibody fragment. While not being limited to a particular theory of the invention, this molecule, by virtue of the antibody fragment binds to specific receptors on the antigen presenting .cells, and the viral antigen is processed and presented complexed with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I and Class II. Such processing and antigen presentation by MHC Class I elicits an increased response by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, resulting in the elimination of any infectious agent associated with the antigen of the immune response domain. In addition, antigen presentation by MHC Class II molecules, elicits a humoral response that also aids in clearance of the antigen from the infected cell and/or from circulation.<br>
The invention also includes methods of breaking tolerance comprising administering a chimeric antigen of the invention to a subject. In the presentation of antigens to elicit a cellular and/or humoral immune response by the use of chimeric antigens, the antigens, which were treated as "self during a chronic infection, are recognized as "foreign." Accordingly, the host's immune system will mount a CTL response to eliminate infected cells. At the same time, antibodies elicited in response to the chimeric antigen will bind to the infectious agent and remove it from the circulation or block binding of the infectious agent to host cells. Accordingly, the present invention is designed to produce chimeric antigens that can induce a broad immune response in subjects who have chronic infections that are otherwise tolerated by the host immune system. In a preferred embodiment, the chimeric antigen breaks tolerance to an antigen in a subject who is chronically infected with an infectious agent, such as a virus or parasite, or who has a cancer. More preferably, the infectious agent is resident inside a host cell at some point during its life cycle.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the immunogenicity of the pre-selected antigen unrecognized or tolerated by the host immune system is increased due to the presence of the antibody fragment as well as by the presence of glycosylation introduced in an<br><br><br>
eukaryotic, e,g. insect, cell expression system. Such a chimeric antigen, due to the presence of the antibody component and glycosylation, will bind to specific receptors present on various immune cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and granulocytes.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention provides methods of activating antigen presenting cells comprising contacting the antigen presenting cells with a chimeric antigen of the invention. The invention also provides methods of enhancing antigen presentation in an antigen presenting cell comprising contacting the antigen presenting cell with a composition comprising a chimeric antigen of the invention. The chimeric antigen can be contacted with the antigen presenting cells, preferably dendritic cells, in vivo or ex vivo. In a preferred embodiment, contacting the chimeric antigen with antigen presenting cells activates the antigen presenting cells and enhances antigen presentation of more than one epitope. This multi-epitopic response can include presentation of one or more epitopes of the immune response domain and/or presentation of one or more epitopes of the target binding domain.<br>
The invention also provides methods of treating an immune-treatable condition comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a chimeric antigen of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the immune-treatable condition is an infection or a cancer. The infection can be a viral infection, a parasitic infection or a bacterial infection. Preferably, the infection will have a stage during which the infectious agent is founu within a host cell. More preferably, the immune-treatable condition is a chronic viral infection. Most preferably, the immune-treatable condition is a chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection or a chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. For the treatment of HBV, the immune response domain preferably comprises at least one antigenic portion of a . protein selected from the group consisting of a HBV Core protein, a HBV S protein, a HBV SI protein, a HBV S2 protein, and combinations thereof. For the treatment of HCV, the immune response domain preferably comprises at least one antigenic portion of a protein selected from the group consisting of a HCV Core (1-191) protein, a HCV Core (1-177) protein, a HCV El protein, a HCV E2 protein, a HCV E1-E2 protein, a HCV NS3A. protein, a HCV NS5A protein, and combinations thereof.<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, administration of the chimeric antigen elicits a greater immune response than administration of the immune response domain alone. The amplitude of the immune response can be measured, for example; (i) by the amount of antigen-specific antibody present in the subject; (ii) by the amount of interferon-y secreted by T cells in response to being exposed to antigen presenting cell loaded -vith the chimeric antigen or immune response domain alone; or (iii) by the amount of antigen specific CD8+ T cells elicited in response to being exposed to antigen presenting cell loaded with the chimeric antigen or immune response domain alone.<br>
The chimeric antigen can be evaluated for its efficacy in generating an immune response by presenting the chimeric antigen to dendritic cells ex vivo or in vivo. The dendritic cells process and present the chimeric antigen to T-lymphocytes, which are evaluated for oroliferation of T cells and for the production of interferon-y as markers of T cell response. Specifically, in the ex vivo situation, naive dendritic cells are isolated from peripheral blood. Activation of the T cells by the dendritic cells is evaluated by measuring markers, e.g. interferon-y levels, by a known procedure. See, e.g., Berlyn, et al., Clin. Immunol 101(3):276-283 (2001). An increase in the percentage of T cells that secrete interferon-y by at least 50% predicts efficacy in vivo. In the case of the in vivo situation, the chimeric antigen is directly introduced parenterally in the host where available dendritic and other antigen-processing cells have the capacity to interact with antigens and to process them accordingly.<br>
Additionally, the invention includes methods of vaccinating a subject against an infection comprising administering a chimeric antigen of the present invention to the subject. The subject can be prophylactically or therapeutically vaccinated. Preferably, the infection is a viral infection. The bifunctional nature of the molecule helps to target the antigen to antigen-presenting cells, e.g. dendritic cells, making it a unique approach in the therapy of chronic infectious diseases by specifically targeting the antigen presenting cells with the most effective stoichiometry of antigen to antibody. This is useful to the development of therapeutic vaccines to cure chronic viral infections such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Human Papilloma Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus, obligate intracellular parasites and may also be applicable to all autologous antigens in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. The administration of these fusion proteins can elicit a broad<br><br><br>
immune response from the host, including both cellular and humoral responses. Thus,<br>
i they can be used as therapeutic vaccines to treat subjects that are immune tolerant to<br>
an existing infection, in addition to being useful as prophylactic vaccines to immunize<br>
subjects at risk for developing a particular infection.<br>
E. Methods of Making Chimeric Antigens<br>
One aspect of the invention provides methods for producing a chimeric antigen comprising (a) providing a microorgamsm or cell line, preferably a eukaryotic, more preferably, a non-mammalian microorganism or cell line that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a chimeric antigen; and (b) culturing said microorganism or cell line under conditions whereby the chimeric antigen is expressed. Preferably, the microorganism or cell line is a yeast, a plant cell line or an insect cell line. More preferably, the cell line is an insect cell line selected from the group consisting of Sf9, Sf21, Drosophila S2, and High Five™.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention uses established recombinant DNA technology for producing the fusion proteins of selected antigen(s) and the target binding domain that are necessary in the practice of the invention. Fusion protein constructs are generated at the DNA level incorporating specific restriction enzyme sites, which are exploited in incorporating the desired DNA fragment into expression vectors, and used to express the desired fusion proteins in a heterologous expression system. As used herein, the term "vector" denotes plasmids that are capable of carrying the DNA, which encode the desired protein(s). Preferred plasmid vectors for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, pFastBac HTa and the corresponding recombinant "bacmids" generated in DHlOBac™ E. coli (Invitrogen).<br>
A gene encoding a target binding domain can be obtained from any antibody producing cell, for example a hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody, via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To facilitate later cloning steps, it is preferable to design the oligonucleotide primers to add unique restriction enzyme recognition sites. Similarly, the antigenic portions of the immune response domain can be obtained from any cell or virus RNA or DNA containing a gene encoding an antigenic portion of the desired target. Preferably, PCR is used to obtain DNA encoding the antigenic portions of the immune response domain and the PCR primers are designed to add unique restriction enzyme recognition sites to facilitate cloning. However, any recombinant DNA method may be used to obtain the DNA encoding the antigenic<br><br><br>
portions of the immune response domain. The polynucleotides encoding the target binding domain and immune response domain can then be combined in a single construct using standard cloning techniques. Alternatively, the separate domains can be cloned with DNA encoding lingers, such as leucine zippers, streptavidin or biotinylation signals.<br>
Preferably, a baculovirus system is used to express the chimeric antigen of the invention not only because large amounts of heterologous proteins are produced, but also because post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, of eukaryotic proteins occur within the infected insect cell. Since cloning directly in insect cells can be difficult, it is preferable to generate the polynucleotide encoding the chimeric antigen in a bacterial system and to transfer the final construct into a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Transfer systems, e.g., the Bac-To-Bac™ system (Invitrogen), are known to those of skill in the art. The Bac-to-Bac™ system utilizes site-specific transposition with the bacterial transposon Tn7 to transfer the gene of interest into a E. coli-insect cell shuttle vector (bacmid). The resulting recombinant bacmids are transfected into insect cells to generate bacuioviruses that express recombinant proteins.<br>
In order to produce bacuioviruses, the bacmid is transfected into insect cells, such as Sf9 cells. Following transfection, the cells are incubated for a period of time sufficient to expand the baculoviral population. The medium containing baculovirus is collected and stored at 4° C in the dark." The transfection can be verified by checking for production of baculoviral DNA by subjecting the viral culture to PCR utilizing primers specific for the desired DNA insert. The expression of the heterologous protein in the cells can be verified by any method known in the art, e.g. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or Western blotting.<br>
Recombinant bacmids of standardized multiplicity of infection (MOI) are used to infect insect cells. Cells are seeded at a density of approximately 3 x 105 cells/mL and incubated in suspension culture at 27.5°C with shaking until the cell density reached approximately 2-3 x 106 cells/mL. Standardized amounts of the respective recombinant baculovirus are then added to the cells. The incubation temperature is 27.5°C and the appropriate infection period is standardized for individual protein expression. The cells are harvested by centrifugation and used for the purification of<br><br><br>
the recombinant proteins. Unused portions of cells can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
Chimeric antigens, preferably, are purified under denaturing conditions. Cells expressing chimeric antigens are lysed in a denaturing buffer, e.g., a buffer containing 6 M guanidinium-HCl. Lysis can be increased by mechanical means, such as sonication. The lysate is centrifuged to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant is then loaded on to a Ni-NTA Super Flow (Qiagen) bead column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Following loading, the column is washed with a buffered denaturing solution, preferably containing 6 M guanidinium-HCl at approximately pH 8. At this point the denaturant can be exchanged to, e.g., 8 M urea in a buffered solution. The lysis, loading and wash buffers preferably contain a low concentration, e.g., 1-40 mM imidazole. After buffer exchange, the column should be washed with buffer until the OD2so drops to, for example, 
The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA, and<br><br><br>
. immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1989; and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience Publishers, (©1995, as Supplemented April 2004, Supplement 66).<br>
F Novel Polynucleotides<br>
Another aspect of the in ention provides polynucleotides encoding a chimeric antigen comprising a first polynucleotide portion encoding an immune response domain and a second polynucleotide portion encoding a target binding domain. The first and second polynucleotide portions may be located on the same or different nucleotide chains.<br>
The invention provides polynucleotides corresponding or complementary to genes encoding chimeric antigens, mRNAs, and/or coding sequences, preferably in isolated form, including polynucleotides encoding chimeric antigen variant proteins; DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA hybrids, and related molecules, polynucleotides or oligonucleotides complementary or having at least a 90% homology to the genes encoding a chimeric antigen or mRNA sequences or parts thereof, and polynucleotides or oligonucleotides that hybridize to the genes encoding a chimeric antigen, mRNAs, or to chimeric antigen-encoding polynucleotides.<br>
Additionally, the invention includes analogs of the genes encoding a chimeric antigen specifically disclosed herein. Analogs include, e.g., mutants, that retain the ability to elicit an immune response, and preferably have a homology of at least 80%, more preferably 90%, and most preferably 95% to any of polynucleotides encoding a chimeric antigen, as specifically described by SEQ ID NOs: 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44,46, and 44. Typically, such analogs differ by only 1 to 15 codon changes. Examples include polypeptides with minor amino acid variations from the natural amino acid sequence of a viral antigen or of an antibody fragment, in particular, conservative amino acid replacements. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Genetically-encoded amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine,    asparagine,    glutamine,    cystine,    serine,    threonine,    tyrosine.<br><br><br><br>
Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified jointly as aromatic amino acids. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar conservative replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on biological activity. Polypeptide molecules having substantially the same amino acid sequence as any of the polypeptides disclosed in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45,47 and 49 but possessing minor amino acid substitutions tha: do not substantially affect the ability of the chimeric antigens to elicit an immune response, are within the definition of a chimeric antigen having the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47 and 49, respectively. Derivatives include aggregative conjugates with other chimeric antigen molecules and covalent conjugates with unrelated chemical moieties. Covalent derivatives are prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups that are found in chimeric antigen amino acid chains or at the N- or C-terminal residues by means known in the art. Amino acid abbreviations are provided in Table 1.<br><br><br>
I Conservative amino acid substitutions can be made in a protein without altering either the conformation or the function of the protein. Proteins of the invention can comprise 1 to 15 conservative substitutions. Such changes include substituting any of isoleucine (I), valine (V), and leucine (L) for any other of these hydrophobic amino acids; aspartic acid (D) for glutamic acid (E) and vice versa; glutamine (Q) for asparagine (N) and vice versa; and serine (S) for threonine (T) and vice versa. Other substitutions can also be considered conservative, depending on the environment of the particular amino acid and its role in the three dimensional structure of the protein. For example,' glycine (G) and alanine (A) can frequently be interchangeable, as can alanine (A) and valine (V). Methionine (M), which is relatively hydrophobic, can frequently be interchanged with leucine and isoleucine, and sometimes with valine. Lysine (K) and arginine (R) are frequently interchangeable in locations in which the significant feature of the amino acid residue is its charge and the differing pKs of these two amino acid residues are not significant. Still other changes can be considered "conservative" in particular environments (see, e.g. Biochemistry 4th Ed.. Lubert Stryer ed. (W. H. Freeman and Co.), pages 18-23; Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc Nafl Acad Sci USA 89:1091,5-10919 (1992); Lei et al, J Biol Chan 270(20): 11882-6 (1995)).<br>
The inventions also provides polynucleotides that hybridize, preferably under stringent conditions, to a polynucleotide encoding a chimeric antigen, as specifically described by SEQ ID NOs: 26, 28, 3D, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 41, 44, 46, and 44. Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured nucleic acid sequences to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature that can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions, see, e.g., Ausubel et al., supra, at pages 2.9.1-2.10.8 and 4.9.1-4.9.13.<br><br><br>
"Stringent conditions" or "high stringency conditions", as defined herein, are identified by, but not limited to, those that (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50°C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum alburain/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42°C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5X SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5X Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42°C, with washes at 42°C in 0.2X SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55°C, followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1X SSC containing EDTA at 55°C "Moderately stringent conditions" are described by, but not limited to, those in Sambrook et al., supra, and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and % SDS) less stringent than those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37°C in a solution comprising: 20% formamide, 5X SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5X Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/mL denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1X SSC at about 37-50°C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.<br>

The invention also provides recombinant DNA or RNA molecules containing a chimeric antigen polynucleo'ide, an analog or homologue thereof, including but not limited to phages, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes), as well as various viral and non-viral vectors well known in the art, and cells transformed or transfected with such recombinant DNA or RNA molecules. Methods for generating such molecules are well known (see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).<br>
The invention further provides a host-vector system comprising a recombinant DNA molecule containing a chimeric antigen polynucleotide, analog or homologue thereof within a suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Examples of suitable eukaryotic host cells include a yeast cell, a plant cell, or an animal cell, such as a mammalian cell or an insect cell (e.g., a baculovirus-infectible cell such as a Sf9, Sf21, Drosophila S2 or High Five™ cell). Examples of suitable mammalian cells include various prostate cancer cell lines such as DU145 and TsuPrl, other transfectable or transducible prostate cancer cell lines, primary cells (PrEC), as well as a number of mammalian cells routinely used for the expression of recombinant proteins (e.g., COS, CHO, 293, 293T cells). More particularly, a polynucleotide comprising the coding sequence of chimeric antigen or a fragment, analog or homolog thereof can be used to generate chimeric antigen thereof using any number of host-vector systems routinely used and widely known in the art.<br>
A wide range of host-vector systems suitable for the expression of chimeric antigens thereof are available, see for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, supra; Ausubel, supra, at pages 1.0.1-1.16.16, 9.01-9.17.3, and 13.4.1-13.6.5). Preferred vectors for insect cell expression include but are not limited to pFastBac HTa (Invitrogen). Using such expression vectors, chimeric antigens can be expressed in several insect cell lines, including for example Sf9, Sf21, Drosophila S2, and High Five. Alternatively, preferred yeast expression systems include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pichia pastoris, and Pichia august.   The<br><br><br>
host-vector systems of the invention are useful for the production of a chimeric<br>
antigen.<br>
A chimeric antigen or an analog or homolog thereof can be produced by cells<br>
transfected with a construct encoding a chimeric antigen. For example, Sf9 cells can<br>
be transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a chimeric antigen or analog or<br>
homolog thereof, the chimeric antigen is expressed in the Sf9 cells, and the chimeric<br>
antigen is isolated using standard purification methods. Various other expression<br>
systems well known in the art can also be employed. Expression constructs encoding<br>
a leader peptide joined in frame to the chimeric antigen coding sequence can be used<br>
for the generation of a secreted form of chimeric antigen.<br>
As discussed herein, redundancy in the genetic code permits variation in chimeric antigen gene sequences. In particular, it is known in the art that specific host species often have specific codon preferences, and thus one can adapt the disclosed sequence as preferred for a desired host. For example, preferred analog codon sequences typically have rare codons (i.e., codons having a usage frequency of less than about 20% in known sequences of the desired host) replaced with higher frequency codons. Codon preferences for a specific species are calculated, for example, by utilizing codon usage tables available on the INTERNET such as at world wide web URL www.kazusa.or.jp/codon.<br>
Additional sequence modifications are known to enhance protein expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon/intron splice site signals, transposon like repeats, and/or other such well-characterized sequences that are deleterious to gene expression. The GC content of the sequence is adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. Where possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures. Other useful modifications include the addition of a translational initiation consensus sequence at the start of the open reading frame, as described in Kozak, Mol Cell Biol, 9:5073-5080 (1989). Skilled artisans understand that the general rule that eukaryotic ribosomes initiate translation exclusively at the 5' proximal AUG codon is abrogated only under rare conditions (see, e.g., Kozak Proc Nat'I Acad Sci USA 92(7): 2662-2666 (1995) and Kozak Nucl Acids Res 15(20): 8125-8148 (1987)).<br><br><br>
G. Pharmaceutical Compositions of the Inventioni<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and a chimeric antigen comprising an immune response domain and a target binding domain, wherein the target binding domain comprises an antibody fragment. In therapeutic applications, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective B cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and/or helper T lymphocyte (Th) response to the antigen and to block infection or to cure or at least partially arrest or slow symptoms and/or complications or a disease or disorder. Amounts effective for this use will depend on, e.g., the particular composition administered, the manner of administration, the stage and severity of the disease being treated, the weight and general state of health of the subject, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
The dosage for an initial therapeutic immunization (with chimeric antigen) generally occurs in a unit dosage range where the lower value is about 1, 5, 50, 500, or 1,000 ng and the higher value is about 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; or 50,000 μg. Dosage values for a human typically range from about 500 ng to about 50,000 μg per 70 kilogram subject. Boosting dosages of between about 1.0 ng to about 50,000 μg of chimeric antigen pursuant to a boosting regimen over weeks to months may be administered depending upon the subject's response and condition. Administration should continue until at least clinical symptoms or laboratory tests indicate that the condition has been prevented, arrested, slowed or eliminated and for a period thereafter. The dosages, routes of administration, and dose schedules are adjusted in accordance with methodologies known in the art.<br>
A human unit dose form of a chimeric antigen is typically included in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a human unit dose of an acceptable carrier, in one embodiment an aqueous carrier, and is administered in a volume/quantity that is known by those of skill in the art to be useful for administration of such polypeptides to humans (see, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Edition, A. Gennaro, Editor, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 2000). As appreciated by those of skill in the art, various factors can influence the ideal dose in a particular case. Such factors include, for example, half life of the chimeric antigen, the binding affinity of the chimeric antigen,<br><br><br>
the immunogenicity of the composition, the desired steady-state concentration level, route of administration, frequency of treatment, and the influence of other agents used in combination with the treatment method of the invention, as well as the health status of a particular subject.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are employed in serious disease states, that is, life-threatening or potentially life-threatening situations. In such cases, as a result of the relative nontoxic nature of the chimeric antigen in preferred compositions of the invention, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer substantial excesses of these chimeric antigens relative to these stated dosage amounts.<br>
The concentration of chimeric antigen of the invention in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be delivered via any route known in the<br>
. art, such as parenterally, intrathecally, iritravascularly, intravenously, intramuscularly,<br>
transdermally, intradermally, subcutaneously, intranasally, topically, orally, rectally,<br>
vaginally, pulmonarily or intraperitoneally. Preferably, the composition is delivered by<br>
parenteral routes, such as subcutaneous or intradermal administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by mixing the desired chimeric antigens with an appropriate vehicle suitable for the intended route of administration. In making the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, the chimeric antigen is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within a carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other When the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the therapeutic agent. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, ..\ aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the chimeric antigen, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br><br><br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include, but arc not limited to, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The forrmlations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving ag
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the chimeric antigen is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a chimeric antigen of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the chimeric antigen is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.<br>
The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
In preparing a composition for parenteral administration strict attention must be paid to tonicity adjustment to reduce irritation. A reconstitutable composition is a<br><br><br><br>
sterile solid packaged in a dry form. A reconstitutable composition is preferred<br>
because it is more stable when stored as a dry solid ratlier than in a solution ready for<br>
i immediate administration.  The dry solid is usually packaged in a sterile container<br>
with a butyl rubber closure to ensure the solid is kept at an optimal moisture range. A<br>
reconstitutable dry solid is formed by dry fill, spray drying, or freeze-drying methods.<br>
Descriptions of these methods may be found, e.g., in Remington, supra, at pages 681-<br>
685 and 802-803.<br>
Compositions for parenteral injection are generally dilute, and the component present in the higher proportion is the vehicle. The vehicle normally has no therapeutic activity and is nontoxic, but presents the chimeric antigen to the body tissues in a form appropriate for absorption. Absorption normally will occur most rapidly and completely when the chimeric antigen is presented as an aqueous solution. However, modification of the vehicle with water-miscible liquids or substitution with water-immiscible liquids can affect the rate of absorption. Preferably, the vehicle of greatest value for this composition is isotonic saline. In preparing the compositions that are suitable for injection, one can use aqueous vehicles, water-miscible vehicles, and nonaqueous vehicles<br>
Additional substances may be included in the injectable compositions of this invention to improve or safeguard the quality of the composition. Thus, an added substance may affect solubility, provide for subject comfort, enhance the chemical stability, or protect the preparation against the growth of microorganisms. Thus, the composition may include an appropriate solubilizer, substances to act as antioxidants, and substances that act as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. These substances will be present in an amount that is appropriate for their function, but will not adversely affect the action of the composition. Examples of appropriate antimicrobial agents include thimerosal, benzethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, phenol, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and propyl p-hyrodxybenzoate. Appropriate antioxidants may be found in Remington, supra, at p. 1015-1017.<br>
In certain embodiments, liposomes, nanocapsules, microparticles, lipid particles, vesicles, and the like, are used for the administration of the chimeric antigens of the present invention. In particular, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated for delivery either encapsulated in a lipid particle, a liposome, a vesicle, a nanosphere, or a nanoparticle or the like. Alternatively,<br><br><br>
compositions of the present invention can be bound, either covalently or non-<br>
covalently, to the surface of such carrier vehicles.<br>
Compositions administered via liposomes may also serve: 1) to target the chimeric antigen to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue; 2) to target selectively to antigen presenting cells; or, 3) to increase the half-life of the peptide composition. Liposomes include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the chimeric antigen to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a molecule that binds to a receptor prevalent among lymphoid cells, such as monoclonal antibodies that bind to the CD45 antigen, or with other therapeutic or immunogenic compositions. Thus, liposomes either filled or decorated . with a desired chimeric antigen of the invention can be directed to the site of lymphoid cells, where the liposomes then deliver the chimeric antigens. Liposomes for use in accordance with the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467-508 (1980), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369. A liposome suspension containing a chimeric antigen may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose which varies according to, inter alia, the manner of administration, the chimeric antigen being delivered, and the stage of the disease being treated.<br>
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described herein. The compositions can be administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a facemask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing   machine.   Solution,   suspension,   or  powder   compositions   may   be<br><br><br>
administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the chimeric antigen of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Additionally, it may be advantageous to include at least one antiviral therapeutic or chemotherapeutic in addition to the chimeric antigen and pharmaceutical excipient. Antiviral therapeutics include, but are not limited to, peptidomimetics (such as amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), polynucleotides (such as ampligen and fomivirsen), purine/pyrimidinones (such as abacavir, acyclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, cytarabine, didanosine, dideoxyadenosine, dipivoxil, edoxudine, emtricitabine, entecovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, idoxuridine, inosine pranobex, lamivudine, MADU, penciclovir, sorivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, trifluridine, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, vidarabine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), sialic acid analogs (such as oseltamivir and zanamivir), acemannan, acetylleucine monothanolamine, amantadine, amidinomycin, ateviridine, capravirine, delavirdine, n-docosanol, efavirenz, foscarnet sodium, interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-γ, kethoxal, lysozyme, methisazone, moroxydine, nevirapine, pentafuside, pleconaril, podophyllotoxin, ribavirin, rimantidine, stallimycin, statolon, termacamra, and traomantadine. Other appropriate antiviral agents are discussed in Remington: supra, at Chapter 87: Anti-Infectives, pp. 1507-1561, particularly pp. 1555-1560. Preferred antiviral therapeutics for inclusion in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include adefovir, dipivoxil, entecovir, lamivudine and ribavirin.<br>
In some embodiments it may be desirable to include in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention at least one component which primes B-lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Lipids have been identified as agents capable of priming CTL in vivo. For example, palmitic acid residues can be attached to the e-and α-amino groups of a<br><br><br>
lysine residue and then linked, e.g., via one or more linking residues such as Gly, Gly-Gly-, Ser, Ser-Ser, or the like, to an immunogenic peptide. The lipidated peptide can then be administered either directly in a micelle or particle, incorporated into a liposome, or emulsified in an adjuvant, e.g., incomplete Freund's adjuvant. In a preferred embodiment, a particularly effective immunogenic composition comprises palmitic acid attached to e- and α-amino groups of Lys, which is attached via linkage, e.g., Ser-Ser, to the amino terminus of the immunogenic peptide.<br>
As another example of lipid priming of CTL responses, E. coli lipoproteins, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinlyseryl-serine (P3CSS) can be used to prime virus specific CTL when covalently attached to an appropriate peptide (see, e.g., Deres, et al., Nature 342:561 (1989)). Chimeric antigens of the invention can be coupled to P3CSS, for example, and the lipopeptide administered to an individual to specifically prime an immune response to the target antigen.<br>
While the compositions of the present invention should not require the use of adjuvants, adjuvant can be used. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, detergents, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, immunostimulatory polynucleotide sequences, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium pa/yum. Additional adjuvants are also well known in the art.<br>
H. Article of Manufacture<br>
Another aspect of this invention provides an article of manufacture that comprises a container holding a composition, comprising a chimeric antigen, that is suitable for injection or reconstitution for injection in combination with printed labeling instructions providing a discussion of how to administer the composition parenterally, e.g. subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intradermally, nasally or intravascularly. The composition will be contained in any suitable containe; that will not significantly interact with the composition and will be labeled with the appropriate labeling that indicates it will be for parenteral use. Associated with the container will be the labeling instructions consistent with the method of treatment as described<br><br><br>
hereinbefore. The container that holds the composition of this invention may be a container having a liquid composition suitable for injection that has an appropriate needle for injection and a syringe so that the patient, doctor, nurse, or other practitioner can administer the chimeric antigen. Alternatively, the composition may be a dry or concentrate composition containing a soluble version of the chimeric antigen, to be combined or diluted with an aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle to dissolve or suspend the composition. Alternatively, the container may have a suspension in a liquid or may be an insoluble version of the salt for combination with a vehicle in which the insoluble version will be suspended. Appropriate containers are discussed in Remington, supra, pages 788-789, 805, 850-851 and 1005-1014<br>
The kit of the invention will typically comprise the container described above and one or more other containers comprising materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use, A label can be present on the container to indicate that the composition is used for a specific therapy or non-therapeutic application, and can also indicate directions for either in vivo or ex vivo use, such as those described above. Directions and or other information can also be included on an insert which is included with the kit.<br>
V.       EXAMPLES<br>
The following non-limiting examples provide further illustration of the invention.<br>
A. Example 1: Construction of TBD Expression Vector<br>
Mouse IgGl DNA sequences encoding amino acids of a portion of CH1-Hinge-CH2-CH3 region was generated from mRNA isolated from the hybridoma (2C12), which produces mAb against HBV surface antigen (sAg). Total mRNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent (Gibco BRL cat. No. 15596-026) and the cDNA of the target binding domain (TBD; mouse immunoglobulins fragment) was generated by RT-PCR using Superscript First-strand Synthesis (Invitrogen Cat. No. 11904-018). The PCR primers contained linker sequences encoding the linker peptide SRPQGGGS- (SEQ ID NO: 1) at the 5' terminus, a unique Not I site at the 5' and a unique Hind III restriction site at the 3' end. The resulting cDNA contains (5' Not I )-linker sequence-CHlCVDKKI) (SEQ ID NO: 2). -Hinge Region- CH2- CH3-(3' Hind<br><br><br>

pFastBac HTa expression vector plasmid (Invitrogen) using the same restriction<br>
enzyme   sites.   The   51  primer  used' for   PCR  amplification   was   (Sense)   5"<br>
TGTCATTCTGCGGCCGCAAGGCGGCGGATCCGTGGACAAGAAAATTGTGC<br>
CCAGG    (SEQ    ID    NO:    3)    and    the    3'    primer    was    (antisense)    5'<br>
ACGAATCAAGCTTTGCAGCCCAGGAGAGTGGGAGAG   (SEQ   ID   NO:   4),<br>
which contained the Not I and Hind III sites, respectively. The following is the<br>
protocol used for directional cloning. The generated fragment was digested with the<br>
respective enzymes, purified on agarose gel and cloned into the vector plasmid. The<br>
DNA sequence and the correctness of the ORF were verified by standard sequencing<br>
methods.<br>
Following the cloning of the DNA encoding the target binding domain into the<br>
pFastBac HTa donor plasmid, the recombinant proteins was expressed using the Bac-<br>
to-Bac™ baculovirus  expression  system  (Invitrogen).     The  cloned  gene  was<br>
transferred into a baculovirus shuttle vector via site-specific transposition in a strain<br>
of E. coli, DHlOBac.  The DHlOBac cells contain the shuttle vector, which confers<br>
kanamycin resistance and a helper plasmid, which encodes the transposase and<br>
confers resistance to tetracycline. A 100 ul aliquot of competent DHl0Bac cells was<br>
thawed on ice, the pFastBac HTa based plasmids were added and the mixture<br>
incubated on ice for 30 minutes.   The mixture was heat shocked for 45 seconds at<br>
42°C and then chilled on ice for 2 minutes. The mixture was then added to 900 uL of<br>
LB media and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C.   The transformed cells were serially<br>
diluted with LB to 10*' and 10*2 and 100 μl of each dilution was plated on LB agar<br>
plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 ug/ml<br>
tetracycline, 100 μg/ml X-gal, and 40 |ig/ml IPTG and incubated for at least 36 hours<br>
at 37°C. The gentamicin resistance was conferred by the pFastBac HTa and the X-gal<br>
and IPTG (isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside) were used to differentiate between white<br>
colonies (recombinant plasmids) and blue colonies (non-recombinant).   The white<br>
colonies were picked and inoculated into 2ml of LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml<br>
kanamycin, 7 ug/ml gentamicin and 10 ug/ml tetracycline and incubated overnight at<br>
37°C, with shaking.   A sterile loop was used to sample a small amount of the<br>
overnight culture and the sample was streaked onto a fresh LB  agar plate<br>
supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline,<br><br><br><br>
100 μg/ml X-gal and 40 ng/ml IPTG and incubated for at least 36 hours at 37°C to<br>
confirm a white phenotype.    Recombinant bacmids were isolated by standard<br>
protocols (Sambrook, supra), the DNA sample was dissolved in 40 μl of TE (l0mM<br>
Tris-HCL pH 8, ImM EDTA) and used for transfections.<br>
In order to produce baculoviruses, the bacmid was transfected into Sf9 insect<br>
cells. Sf9 cells (9 x 105) were seeded into each well of a 6-well cell culture dish<br>
(35mm wells) in 2 ml of ESF 921 (Expression Systems) and allowed to attach for at<br>
least 1 hour at 27°C. Transfections were carried out using Cellfection® Reagent<br>
(Invitrogen, Cat. No. 10362-010) as per the protocols provided by the supplier of the<br>
Sf9 cells. Following transfection, the cells were incubated at 27°C for 72 hours. The<br>
medium containing baculovirus was collected and stored at 4°C in the dark.	<br>
The efficiency of the transfection was verified by checking for production of baculoviral DNA. The isolated baculovirus DNA was subjected to PCR to screen for the inserted gene encoding the TBD. The primers used were (sense) 5' TATTCCGGATTATTCATACCG (SEQ ID NO: 5) and 3' (antisense) 5' CTCTACAAATGTGGTATGGC (SEQ ID NO: 6). Amplified products were run on an agarose gel (0.8%). The expression of the heterologous protein in the cells was verified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blots using the 6xHis tag monoclonal antibody (Clonetech) as the probe.<br>
Once production of baculovirus and the expression of protein were confirmed, the virus production was amplified to produce a concentrated stock of the bacuiovirus that carry the gene encoding the target binding domain. It is standard practice in the art to amplify the baculovirus at least two times, and in all protocols described herein this standard practice was adhered to. After the second round of amplification, the concentration of the generated baculovirus was quantified using a plaque assay according to the protocols described by the manufacturer of the kit (Invitrogen). The most appropriate concentration of the virus to infect High Five cells and the optimum time point for the production of the desired protein was established as well.<br>
Generally, for the expression of the TBD an MOI of 1 and a time period of 48 hours<br><br>
was used.<br>
B. Example 2: Construction of Chimeric Antigen Expression Vectors<br>
The DNA encoding the desired viral antigen was generated from the template using PCR methodology using the 5' sense and 3' anti-sense primers indicated in<br><br><br>
Table 2. The 5' end of the resulting amplified fragment contained tlie unique restriction site "5' enzy," and the 3' end contained the unique restriction site "3' enzy," each of which was used for ligations.<br>
TABLE 2: Construction of Chimeric Antigen Vectors<br><br>
Amplified DNA was digested with appropriate 5' and 3' restriction enzymes and ligated with a pFastBac HTa expression vector to generate the expression plasmid for the viral antigen alone. The same fragment of DNA was also ligated with the plasmid pFastBac HTa-TBD, described in Example 1, following digestion with the respective enzymes to produce the expression plasmid for the viral antigen fused to tlie target binding domain. The resulting plasmid was used to produce recombinant baculovirus, as described in Example 1, for subsequent use in expression of the chimeric antigen. The DNA and amino acid sequences of the chimeric antigens are provided in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
TABLE 3: Chimeric Antigen Sequences<br>
C. Example 3: Expression and Purification of TBD, Viral Antigens and Chimeric Antigens<br>
Recombinant bacmids of standardized multiplicity of infection (MOI) were used to infect High Five™ insect cells. For suspension cultures, cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 105 cells/mL and incubated at 27.5°C with shaking at 138 rpm until the cell density reached 2-3 x 106 cells/mL. Standardized amounts of the respective recombinant baculovirus was added to the cells. The incubation temperature was 27.5°C and the appropriate infection period was standardized for individual protein expression. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C and used for the purification of the recombinant proteins. Unused portions of cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
Recombinant proteins were purified under denaturing conditions. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 6 M Guanidinium-HCl in 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0 (lysis buffer). The suspension was sonicated on ice with 5 pulses of 1 minute per pulse at a power setting of 60 watts, and was mixed at room temperature for 1 hour. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was loaded on to a Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) bead column (1x5 cm/100 mL cell lysate), pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Following loading, the column was washed with 20 column volumes of 6 M guanidinium-HCl in 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0 (wash buffer 1), followed by washes with 20<br><br><br>
column volumes of 8 M urea in 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris, 300 m,M NaCl, 40<br>
mM imidazole, pH 8.0 (wash buffer 2). The bound protein was eluted with a buffer<br>
containing 8 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM<br>
imidazole, pH 8 (Elution Buffer). The fractions containing the protein were pooled<br>
and dialyzed at 4°C against multiple changes of dialysis buffer (l0mM NaH2PO4, 300<br>
mM  NaCl).  Purified  proteins  were  characterized  using  standard  biochemical<br>
techniques including SDS gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and western blot<br>
analysis using antibodies against different domains of the expressed proteir.<br>
D. Example 4: Breaking Tolerance to a " Self " Protein Using a Chimeric Antigen Fusion Protein.<br>
In order to evaluate the immune response to chimeric antigen fusion proteins, mice were immunized with purified HBV S1/S2, TBD or S1/S2-TBD proteins and the antibodies produced against the individual proteins were quantified. Proliferation of splenic T cells harvested from immunized mice was evaluated following challenge with the respective proteins.<br>
BALB/c mice at 15 weeks of age were used for the immunizations. Mice were injected subcutaneously with S1/S2-TBD (4.15 μg),. S1/S2 (4.15μg) or TBD (4.15 μg) four times at two week intervals. Blood samples were collected before the start of immunizations and a week following each of the immunizations. Serum was prepared from clotted blood samples and used for the estimation of antibody levels produced by the host animal against the respective antigens injected.<br>
1.  ELISA for detection of antibodies against HBV S1/S2, TBD or S1/S2-TBD<br>
A 96-well plate was coated with antigens HBV S1/S2, TBD or S1/S2-TBD at a concentration of 1.0 ng/mL overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed with PBS containing 2% BSA. Diluted serum from the respective animal was added to each of the wells at various dilutions (1:10 - be500) and incubated at 37°C for lhr. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer). Goat anti-mouse IgG Fab-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) (1:5000) dilution was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for lhr. The plate was washed with wash buffer and color was developed using 2-2' azino-di-(3-ethyl benzylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (KPL, Guildford,<br><br><br><br>
UK). The optical density of resulting color in the samples was measured using an<br>
ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) at a wavelength of 405 nm. Negative<br>
control for the experiment was pre-immune serum from the same animal, which was<br>
subtracted from all the experimental values.   The results for mice immunized with<br>
HBV S1/S2-TBD are presented in Table 4.   The chimeric antigen elicits a strong<br>
antibody response against the chimeric antigen (S1/S2-TBD).<br>
TABLE 4: Humoral response to S1/S2-TBD<br><br>
	Level of antibody binding to:<br>
	HBV S1/S2-TBD	HBVS1/S2	TBD<br>
Mice<br>
immunized<br>
with	HBV S1/S2-TBD	0.192	0.059	0.048<br><br>
	HBV S1/S2	0.073	0.015	0.025<br><br>
	TBD	0.076	0.017	0.036<br>
The antibody response here is of a multivalent (or multi-epitopic) nature. The results presented in Table 4 show that antibodies produced by mice immunized with HBV S1/S2-TBD bind to the chimeric antigen and to the S1/S2 protein target coated on the plate. Therefore, antibodies are produced against the S1/S2 component of the chimeric antigen. Likewise, antibodies produced by mice immunized with HBV S1/S2-TBD bind to the target binding domain protein (Table 4). Chimeric antigen that contains protein of mouse origin can generate a humoral immune response in a mouse, evidence that the chimeric antigen can convert a "self antigen into "foreign." Accordingly, it is possible to break tolerance to a protein otherwise treated as a "self protein.<br>
2.  T cell proliferation assay<br>
Animals were sacrificed a week, after the fourth immunization, the spleen was removed, and a single cell suspension was produced. Cells were seeded in triplicate at a cell density of 4x105 cells/well in a 96-well plate. They were loaded with the respective antigens, HBV S1/S2, TBD or S1/S2-TBD, at concentrations of 0.1 μg/mL, 1.0 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL. Negative control cells received media alone and the positive control for T cell proliferation was Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 1.0 - 5.0 μg/mL. The cell cultures were incubated for 4 days at 37°C under an atmosphere of 7% CO2. Each of the wells of cells was pulsed with 1.0 mCi of 3[H]-thymidine and incubated for an additional 18 hours. The cells were harvested using TOMTEC<br><br><br>
MACH 3 cell harvester (Hamden, CT, USA) and the radioactivity bound to the glass fibre filter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) was quantified using a Wallac Trilux 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation and luminescence counter (Wallac, USA). The results are shown in Table 5.<br>
TABLE 5: Cellular response to HBV S1/S2-TBD<br><br>
T cell proliferation was seen when challenged with HBV S1/S2-TBD, S1/S2 or TBD. Immunization with the chimeric antigen induced a multivalent T cell response, i.e., a response against different parts of the same protein. Chimeric antigen that contain protein of mouse origin can generate a cellular immune response in a mouse, evidence that the chimeric antigen can convert a "self antigen into "foreign." Therefore, it is possible to break tolerance to a protein otherwise treated as a "self protein.<br>
E. Example 5: Antigen Presentation Assays<br>
The ability of HBV S1/S2-TBD to elicit an immune response was measured using an ex vivo antigen presentation assay. The generation of an effective T cell response following multiple stimulations of naive T cells with antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) was assessed by quantitating the increase in the number of antigen-specific T cells as well as the ability of the T cells to produce the Thl cytokine IFN-/.<br>
1.   Selection of Monocytes by Adhesion<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed by the addition of AIM-V (ratio of 9 ml of AIM-V added to 1 ml of frozen cells). The cells were then centrifuged at 200x g for 5 min, the supernatant removed, and the cells resuspended in AIM-V/1% matched serum and added to either a 100 mm culture dish or a T-25 culture flask. The PBMCs were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a humidified incubator</td>
