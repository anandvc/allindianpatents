				<td>The present invention relates to piperidine derivatives useful as selective CCR5 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of a CCR5 antagonist of this invention and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The invention further relates to the use of a CCR-5 antagonist of this invention, alone or in combination with another agent, in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.<br>
The global health crisis caused by HIV, the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), is unquestioned, and while recent advances in drug therapies have been successful in slowing the progression of AIDS, there is still a need to find a safer, more efficient, less expensive way to control the virus.<br>
It has been reported that the CCR5 gene plays a role in resistance to HIV infection. HIV infection begins by attachment of the virus to a target cell membrane through interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 and a secondary chemokine co-receptor molecule, and proceeds by replication and dissemination of infected cells through the blood and other tissue. There are various chemokine receptors, but for macrophage-tropic HIV, believed to be the key pathogenic strain that replicates in vivo in the early stages of infection, the principal chemokine receptor required for the entry of HIV into the cell is CCR5. Therefore, interfering with the interaction between the viral receptor CCR5 and HIV can block HIV entry into the cell. The present invention relates to small molecules which are CCR5<br><br>
CCR-5 receptors have been reported to mediate cell transfer in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and allergies, and inhibitors of such receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such diseases, and in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, solid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease.<br>
Related piperidine derivatives which are muscarinic antagonists useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer"s disease are disclosed in US patents 5,883,096; 6,037,352; 5,889,006; 5,952,349; and 5.977,138.<br>
A-M. Vandamme et al., Antiviral Chemistry &amp; Chemotherapy. 9:187-203 (1998) disclose current clinical treatments of HIV-1 infections In man including at least triple drug combinations or so-called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ("HAART"); HAART involves various comblnatiorte of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NRTI"), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NNRTI") and HIV protease inhibitors ("PI"). In compliant drug-naive patients, HAART is effective in reducing mortality and progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. However, these multidrug therapies do not eliminate HIV-1 and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. Development of new drug therapies to provide better HIV-1 treatment remains a priority.<br><br><br><br>

identifies inhibitors of RANTES binding. This assay utilizes membranes prepared from NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human CCR5 chemokine receptor which have the ability to bind to RANTES, a natural ligand for the receptor. Using a 96-well plate format, membrane preparations are incubated with ■"25|. RANTES in the presence or absence of compound for one hour. Compounds are serially diluted over a wide range of 0.001 ug/ml to 1 ug/ml and tested in triplicates. Reaction cocktails are harvested through glass fiber filters, and washed thoroughly. Total counts for replicates are averaged and data reported as the concentration required to inhibit 50 percent of total ■"25|. RANTES binding. Compounds with potent activity in the membrane binding assay are further characterized in seconday cell-based HIV-1 entry and replication assays. HIV-1 Entry Assav:<br>
Replication defective HIV-1 reporter virions are generated by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 {which has been modified by mutation of the envelope gene and introduction of a luciferase reporter plasmid) along with a plasmid encoding one of several HIV-1 envelope genes as described by Connor et al, Viroloov. 206 (1995), p. 935-944. Following transfection of the two plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation, the viral supematants are harvested on day 3 and a functional viral titer determined. These stocks are then used to infect U87 cells stably expressing CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 which have been preincubated with or without test compound. Infections are carried out for 2 hours at 37 "C, the cells washed and media replaced with fresh media containing compound. The cells are incubated for 3 days, lysed and luciferase<br><br>
activity determined. Results are reported as the concentration of compound required to iniiibit 50% of the luciferase activity in the control cultures. HIV-1 Replication Assay:<br>
This assay uses primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the stable U87-CCR5 cell line to determine the effect of anti-CCR5 compounds to block infection of primary HIV-1 strains. The primary lymphocytes are purified from normal healthy donors and stimulated in vitro with PHA and IL-2 three days prior to infection. Using a 96-well plate format, cells are pretreated with drug for 1 hour at 37 "C and subsequently infected with an M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Following infection, the cells are washed to remove residual inoculum and cultured in the presence of compound for 4 days. Culture supernatants are harvested and viral replication nrasured by determination of viral p24 antigen concentration. Calcium Flux Assay:<br>
Cells expressing the HIV coreceptor CCR5 are loaded with calcium sensitive dyes prior to addition of compound or the natural CCR5 ligand. Compounds with agonist properties will induce a calcium flux signal In the cell, while CCR5 antagonists are identified as compounds which do not induce signaling by themselves but are capable of blocking signaling by the natural ligand RANTES. GTPyS Binding Assav (secondan/ membrane binding assay):<br>
A GTPyS binding assay measures receptor activation by CCR5 ligands. This assay measures the binding of 35s labeled-GTP to receptor coupled G-proteins that occurs as a result of receptor activation by an appropriate ligand. In this assay, the CCR5 ligand, RANTES, is incubated with membranes from CCR5 expressing cells and binding to the receptor activation (or binding) is determined by assaylng for bound 35$ label. The assay quantitatively determines if compounds exhibit agonist characteristics by inducing activation of the receptor or alternatively antagonist properties by measuring inhibition of RANTES binding in a competitive or non-competitive fashion. Chemotaxis Assav:<br>
The chemotaxis assay is a functional assay which characterizes the agonist vs. antagonist properties of the test compounds. The assay measures the ability of a non-adherent murine cell line expressing human CCR5 (BaF-550) to migrate across a membrane in response to either test compounds or natural ligands (i.e., RANTES, MIP-1B). Cells migrate across the pemneable membrane towards compounds with agonist activity. Compounds that are antagonists not only fail to induce chemotaxis, but are<br><br>
also capable of inhibiting cell migration in response to known CCR5 ligands.<br>
