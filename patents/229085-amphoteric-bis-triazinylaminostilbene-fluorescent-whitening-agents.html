Amphoteric Fluorescent Whitening Agents<br>
The present invention relates to amphoteric bis-triazinylaminostilbene fluorescent whitening agents (FWA's,, a process for their preparation and the use thereof for fluorescent whitening of synthetic or natural organic materials, in particular, paper.<br>
The most commonly used types of fluorescent whitening agent for the fluorescent whitening of paper are those belonging to the class of di-, tetra- or hexasulphonic acid derivatives of bis-triazinylaminostilbenes, which are anionic in nature. Modern paper-making techniques, however, generally employ cationic polymers as assistants, for example, as retention agents or dewatering aids, in particular, during the production of recycling papers, which, most probably contain residual amounts of anionic FWA's. The presence of cationic polymers, however, results in quenching of the fluorescence of anionic FWA's, which is clearly disadvantageous. Consequently, there is a need for a type of FWA, which is not quenched by such polymers and, in addition, is combfnable with anionic FWA's.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain novel amphoteric FWA's are neither detrimentally affected by the presence of cationic polymers nor by the presence of residual amounts of anionic FWA's and also exhibit excellent whitening properties when applied to paper.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides novel amphoteric fluorescent whitening agents, which comprise a mixture of compounds of the formulae<br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
D represents -NR5R6 and<br>
E represents -Xt-YrNRrRe, whereby<br>
X and Xi each, independently of each other, represent -O- or -NH-,<br>
Y and Y1 each, independently of each other, represent a straight-chain C2-C8alkylene or<br>
branched C3-C8alkylene chain, which may be interrupted by one or two nitrogen, oxygen or<br>
sulphur atoms or represent a 5- or 6-membered cycloaliphatic ring, preferably cyclohexyl,<br>
Ri. R2. R5 and R6 each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-8alkyl,<br>
C2-C4hydroxyalkyl, C1-C4alkoxy,aIkyl, phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by<br>
halogen, ,alkoxy, ,alkyl or sulphonamido, or<br>
R, and R2 and /or R5 and R6, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached,<br>

M represents hydrogen, an alkaline or alkaline earth metal, ammonium or alkyl ammonium.<br>
Amphoteric compounds of formula (1a, - (1c, may exist either in the form of an internal or external salt. Thus, for example, in the case in which M in the above formulae represents hydrogen, compounds (1a, - (1c, may exist as an equilibrium mixture of a neutral molecule and of a zwitterion, wherein M designates a negative charge in the form of S03 whilst the proton resides on the amine residues in the form of ammonium salts -N+ HR3R4 and -N HR7Re. Consequently, in order for the compounds of formulae (1 a, - (1 c, to be truly amphoteric in character, it is necessary for the total number of acidic groups and of basic amino groups present in the molecule to be equal. Since the diaminostilbene disulphonic acid moiety already contains two sulphonic acid groups, it is preferable that no further acidic groups are present in the molecules (1a, - (1c, and, furthermore, that they are substituted with two amino groupswhich are of sufficiently high basicity to be capable of forming zwitterions i.e. in addition to amino groups attached directly to a triazine ring.<br>

The mixture of compounds of formulae ,1 a,, ,1 b, and ,1 c, of the invention may be prepared by reacting, under known reaction conditions, cyanuric chloride, successively, in any desired sequence, with each of 4,4,-diaminostilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid, amino compounds of formulae R1R2NH and R5ReNH or mixtures thereof and compounds of formulae R3R4NYXH and R7R8NY1H or mixtures thereof, whereby X, X1f Y, Y1f R1f R2, R3, R4, R5l R6, R7 and R8 are as previously defined.<br>
Depending on the amounts and proportions of the amines R1R2NH and R5R6NH and of the compounds of formulae R3R4NYXH and R7R8NY1H and whether they are added sequentially or simultaneously as a mixture, the proportions of the compounds ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c, can be varied considerably.

More preferably, the compounds ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c, are present in the approximate molar ratios of 20-50% of the compound of formula ,1a,, 25-50% of the compound of formula ,1b, and 5-35% of the compound of formula ,1c,. Naturally, such mixtures may also be obtained by mechanical mixing of the individually prepared components.<br>
Similarly, the compound of formula ,2, may be prepared by reacting, under known reaction conditions, cyanuric chloride, successively, in any desired sequence, with each of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid, an amino compound of formula R1R2NH, an amino compound of formula R5R6NH, a hydroxy compound of formula R3R4NYOH and a compound<br><br>

In certain cases, it may be advantageous to isolate the intermediate dichlorotriazinylamino derivatives of '-diaminostilbene,,- disulphonic acid, either as pure asymmetric compounds or as their mixtures, which are subsequently reacted further to yield either mixtures of compounds of formulae ,1a,t ,1b, and ,1c,, compounds of formula ,2, or compounds of formula ,3,. Since a number of these intermediate dichloro derivatives are novel, a further aspect of the invention is a compound of formula<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
Rn and R12l each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-4alkyl,<br>
C2-C4hydroxyaIkylf C1-C4alkoxyC1-C4all<yl or together with the nitrogen atom to which they></yl>
are attached, complete a morpholino-, piperidino- or pyrrolidino-ring,<br>
R13 represents phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, C1-4alkoxy,<br>
C1-4alkyl or sulphonamido and<br>
M represents hydrogen, an alkaline or alkaline earth metal, ammonium or alkyl ammonium.<br><br>
Preferably, R^ and R12l each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-4a!kyl, C2-C4hydroxyalkyl, especially, both representing C1-C3hyroxyalkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, complete a morpholino-ring, whilst R13 represents phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by methoxy, ethoxy or -S02NH2, especially, unsubstituted, sulphonamido- or ethoxy-substituted phenyl and M represents hydrogen, lithium, potassium or sodium, especially, hydrogen or sodium.<br>
In analogy to the previously described processes, compounds of formula ,4a, or a mixture of compounds of formulae ,4a,, ,4b, and ,4c, may be prepared by reacting, under known reaction conditions, cyanuric chloride, successively, in any desired sequence, with each of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid, an amino compound of formula R11R12 NH and an amino compound of formula Ri3NH2 or with a mixture of amino compounds R11R12NH and R13NH2, R11f R12 and R13 being as previously defined.<br>
As previously mentioned, intermediate compounds of formula ,4a, are useful for the preparation of those compounds of formula ,2,, wherefn, R, and R2 each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-C4alkyl, C2-C4hydroxyalkyl, C1-4alkoxyC1-4alkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, complete a morpholino-, piperidino- or pyrroiidino-ring, R5 represents phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, C1-4alkoxy, C1-C4alkyl or sulphonamido, R6 represents hydrogen and Xi, Y, Yi, R3| R^ R7, R8 and M are as defined previously and also are useful for the preparation of those compounds of formula ,3,, in which, in formula ,3,, Ri and R2 each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-4alkyl, C2-C4hydroxyalkyl, C1-4aIkoxyC1-4alkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, complete a morpholino-, piperidino- or pyrrolidino-ring, Rs represents phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, C1-4alkoxy, C1-4alkyl or sulphonamido, R6 represents hydrogen and Y, Yi, R3, R4f R9, R10, and M are as previously defined.<br>
Furthermore, the mixtures of compounds of formulae ,4a,, ,4b, and ,4c, are useful for the preparation of those mixtures of compounds of formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, in which, in formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, Rt and R2 each independently of each other, represent hydrogen, C1-4alkyl, C2-C4hydroxyalkyl, C1-4lkoxyC1-4alkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, complete a morpholino-, piperidino- or pyrrolidino-ring, R5 represents phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, C1-4alkoxy,<br><br>
C1-4a!kyI or sulphonamiclo, R6 represents hydrogen and X, Xt, Y, Y1, R3, FU, R7l R8 and M are as defined previously.<br>
One further aspect of the preparation of certain compounds and compound mixtures described above is also of importance. In the case in which X or X1 represents oxygen and at least one of the substituents R3, R4, R7 and R8 represents hydrogen, it may be necessary to introduce a protective group such as -COAIkyl onto the nitrogen atom in order to ensure reaction occurring in the desired direction, the protective group being subsequently removed by conventional methods.<br>
A further synthetic variation, which may be advantageous for the preparation of asymmetric derivatives, is to replace the 4,4,-diaminostilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid by 4-amino-4'-nitrostilbene-2,2'- disulphonic acid and, after carrying out the desired condensation reactions, reducing the nitro group to an amino group, whereby further desired condensation reactions may subsequently be performed.<br>
All starting materials are known compounds, which are readily available or may be prepared by known methods.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a composition for whitening of paper, which contains water, a fluorescent whitening agent which comprises a mixture of compounds of the formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, a fluorescent whitening agent of formula ,2, or a fluorescent whitening agent of the formula<br><br><br>
Y, Yi, Rtl R2l R3, FU, R5, R6. and M are as defined previously, and, optionally, auxiliaries.<br>
Such compositions may comprise not only mixture of compounds of the formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, compounds of formula ,2, and compounds of formula ,5, alone, but also mixtures of the individual component mixtures and components with one another<br>
More specifically, such brightener compositions contain water and, in each case based on the weight of the formulation, from 3 to 25% by weight, preferably from 5 to 15% by weight of the above defined fluorescent whitening agent mixture and also 0 to 60%, preferably 5 to 50% by weight, of auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable auxiliaries include, for example, anionic or non-ionic dispersants from the class of ethylene oxide adducts with fatty alcohols, higher fatty acids or alkyl phenols or ethylenediamine ethylene oxide-propylene oxide adducts, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone with 3-vinylpropionic acid, polyethylene glycols, water retention aids, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol or sorbitol, or biocides.<br>
Since most of the mixtures of compounds of formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, the compounds of formula ,2, and the compounds of formula ,5, are excellent fluorescent whitening agents for substrates such as paper, the present invention further provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of paper comprising contacting the substrate with a fluorescent whitening agent which comprises a mixture of compounds of formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1 c,, a compound of formula ,2, and/or a compound of formula ,5,.<br>
When used for the fluorescent whitening of paper, the mixture of compounds of formulae ,1a,, ,1b, and ,1c,, the compound of formula ,2, and/or the compound of formula ,5,, according to the present invention, may be applied to the paper substrate in the pulp mass, in the form of a paper coating composition, or directly in the size press or metering press.<br>
In one preferred aspect, the present invention provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of a paper surface, comprising contacting the paper surface with a coating composition comprising a white pigment; a binder dispersion; optionally a water-soluble co-binder; and sufficient of a fluorescent whitening agent, according to the present invention, to ensure that the treated paper contains<br><br>
0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the white pigment, of a fluorescent whitening agent of the invention.<br>
As the white pigment component of the paper coating composition used according to the method of the present invention, there are preferred inorganic pigments, e.g., aluminium or magnesium silicates, such as China clay and kaolin and, further, barium sulfate, satin white, titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate ,chalk, or talcum; as well as white organic pigments.<br>
The paper coating compositions used according to the method of the present invention may contain, as binder, inter alia, plastics dispersions based on copolymers of butadiene/styrene, acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene, acrylic acid esters, acrylic acid esters/styrene/acrylonitrile, ethylene/vinyl chloride and ethylene/vinyl acetate; or homopolymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene and polyvinyl acetate or polyurethanes. A preferred binder consists of styrene/butyl acrylate or styrene/butadiene/ acrylic acid copolymers or styrene/butadiene rubbers. Other polymer latices are described, for example, in U.S.Patent Specifications 3,265,654, 3,657,174, 3,547,899 and 3,240,740.<br>
The optional water-soluble protective colloid may be, e.g., soya protein, casein, carboxymethylcellulose, natural or modified starch, chitosan or a derivative thereof or, especially, polyvinyl alcohol. The preferred polyvinyl alcohol protective colloid component may have a wide range of saponification levels and molecular weights; e.g. a saponification level ranging from 40 to 100; and an average molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.<br>
Recipes for coating compositions for paper are described, for example, in J.P. Casey "Pulp and Paper"; Chemistry and Chemical Technology, 2nd edition, Volume III, pagesl 684-1649 and in "Pulp and Paper Manufacture", 2nd and 5th edition, Volume II, page497 ,McGraw-Hill,.<br>
The paper coating compositions used according to the method of the present invention preferably contain 10 to 70% by weight of a white pigment. The binder is preferably used in an amount, which is sufficient to make the dry content of<br><br>
polymeric compound up to 1 to 30% by weight, preferably 5 to 25% by weight, of the white pigment. The amount of fluorescent brightener preparation used according to the invention is calculated so that the fluorescent brightener is preferably present in amounts of 0.01 to 1% by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 1% by weight, and especially 0.05 to 0.6% by weight, based on the white pigment.<br>
The paper coating composition used in the method according to the invention can be prepared by mixing the components in any desired sequence at temperatures from 10 to 100°C, preferably 20 to 80°C. The components here also include the customary auxiliaries, which can be added to regulate the rheological properties, such as viscosity or water retention capacity, of the coating compositions. Such auxiliaries are, for example, natural binders, such as starch, casein, protein or - gelatin, cellulose ethers, such as carboxyalkylcellulose or hydroxyalkylcellulose, alginic acid, alginates, polyethylene oxide or polyethylene oxide alkyl ethers, copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, water-soluble condensation products of formaldehyde with urea or-melamine, polyphosphates or polyacrylic acid salts.<br>
The coating composition used according to the method of the present invention is preferably used to produce coated printed or writing paper, or special papers such as ink-jet or photographic papers, or cardboard.<br>
The coating composition used according to the method of the invention can be applied to the substrate by any conventional process, for example with an air blade, a coating blade, a roller, a doctor blade or a rod, or in the size press, after which the coatings are dried at paper surface temperatures in the range from 70 to 200°C, preferably 90 to 130°C, to a residual moisture content of 3-8%, for example with infra-red driers and/or hot-air driers. Comparably high degrees of whiteness are thus achieved even at low drying temperatures.<br>
By the use of the method according to the invention, the coatings obtained are distinguished by optimum distribution of the dispersion fluorescent brightener over the entire surface and by an increase in the level of whiteness thereby achieved,<br><br>
by a high fastness to light and to elevated temperature ,e.g. stability for 24 hours at 60-100°C., and excellent bleed-fastness to water.<br>
In a second preferred aspect, the present invention provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of a paper surface comprising contacting the paper in the size press with an aqueous solution containing a size, optionally an inorganic or organic pigment and 0.1 to 20g/l of a fluorescent whitening agent of the invention. Preferably, the size is starch, a starch derivative or a synthetic sizing agent, especially a water-soluble copolymer.<br>
In a third preferred aspect, the invention provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of paper during paper formation, whereby the FWA is added directly to the pulp mass. In this case, the FWA may be in the form of a solution, a dispersion or as a powder, whereby the FWA's of the invention are especially valuable in that their effect is not inhibited by the presence of cationic polymers, fixing agents, wet-strengthening agents or de-inking auxiliaries, which are similarly added to the pulp mass prior to paper formation. Examples of such auxiliaries may include dicyandiamide condensation products, polyvinyl amines, polyethylene imines, cationic starches, poly-DADMAC ,diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride,, polyamide amines and polyepoxides.<br>
In a final aspect, the invention relates to paper, which has been treated with a fluorescent whitening agent comprising either a mixture of compounds of formulae ,1 a,, ,1 b, and ,1 c,, a compound of formula ,2, or a compound of formula ,5,.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are particularly advantageous in that they exhibit not only extremely high whitening ability, also in the presence of cationic polymers or residual amounts of anionic FWA's, but, in addition, in many cases highly desirable water solubilities and fastness properties.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention without intending to be restrictive in nature; parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Percentage compositions of reaction mixtures are calculated as the areas under the curves of the respective HPLC spectra, observed at 350nm.<br><br><br>
