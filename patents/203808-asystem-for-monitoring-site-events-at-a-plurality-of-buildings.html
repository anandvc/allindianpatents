Prior Art<br>
WO98/53430 Al (Fox) describes a computer-based system to solve the technical problem of tracking and reporting attendance of individuals at continuing education activities. The system uses an identification device such as a magnetic card that has been provided to an individual prior to their attendance of an event An identification card is read by an electronic card reader situated at the location of the educational activity. On entering the site of the educational activity, data from the identification card is electronically recognized by the card reader and stored. After all of the attendees have been identified, data stored in the card reader is transferred to a central computer. Information concerning the attendance of individuals at certain educational events can then be analysed and sorted to generate attendance reports etc.<br>
US-5-623-258-A (Dorfman) describes a system to solve a technical problem of monitoring the tour that a security guard must undertake in each building of a plurality of building sites. This patent teaches the use of a system that comprises of a system control center that has two-way communication via a telephone network with each of a large number of building sites. Within each building, a building site unit has a two-way communication by broadcast with a large number of tour station units. A guard with a guard identification card checks in through a card reader at each tour station unit. A unique tour station unit identification number is associated with the guard identification number and transmitted to the building site unit where it is associated with the time and date before being transmitted to the system control center. This system provides that a large number of sites and a large number of tour station units can all be monitored on a close to real time basis.<br><br>
2A<br>

including data transmission via the communications<br>
network with checking of input access and<br>
identification data including individual personal<br>
features together with encryption and decryption of<br>
transmitted data and processing of the data.<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Building management companies face an increasing burden in managing the<br><br>
3<br>
maintenance of building equipment since modem buildings use ever more sophisticated equipment and machinery. The problem is to monitor and manage these site events for any number of buildings efficiently. This problem has not been addressed by the prior art discussed above. The system proposed by Fox does not allow for real-time data transfer. The systems proposed by both Fox and Dorfman relate to specific unrelated problems.<br>
Solution of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a system for monitoring site events at a plurality of buildings, comprising a database accessible via the internet; a plurality of uniquely identified site terminals adapted to access the database by means of web browser software, each terminal having means for enabling a user with access rights to view and enter data on line into the database; at least one site terminal being physically secured at each said building such that the database provides current status information including entry records and times and associated information relating to site events for each building.<br>
The invention is advantageous because the information held centrally on the database can be selectively accessed by owners, managers and tenants etc. of the buildings as well as contractors etc. and they can thus be made aware of the status of any building, its site events and site event history. Furthermore a management company and a building occupier have access to this information so that they are able to analyse the performance and reliability of building equipment and the contractors retained to carry out maintenance of that equipment.<br>
The substance of a preferred embodiment of this invention is that by using a purpose-built stand-alone, robust, web browser enabled "site terminal" located within a building or building complex, with a unique internet address, a central database accessible via the internet can be updated in "real time" with details such as the reporting of an instance of building equipment failure, requesting repair of an item of equipment, recording the attendance of a maintenance contractor at the site, the time<br><br>
4<br>
at which they leave the site and the outcome of their visit. The invention would also particularly be used to track and monitor visits by contractors, consultants, surveyors and others thereby enabling the recording of all visits and their purpose, outcome etc. The term "real time" is used to mean that changes made to the information held on the central database via a site terminal is instantaneous or near instantaneous either within the parameters of normal computer data transfer over the internet or within the parameters of normal computer data transfer using internet technology.<br>
Visitors are given pre-assigned usemames, passwords etc. in order to utilise the web browser on the site terminal and interact with the database on a controlled and secure basis.<br>
Generally speaking the geographical location of a computer with a "web browser" on a network or one connected to the internet is not a relevant factor in its use and operation. The inventive step attributed to this new invention is firstly that it utilises a unique pre-loaded internet address, together with the fact that the purpose-built "site terminal" is securely fixed to a wall or part of the building fabric, to securely abstract, for example, the real-time event of a certain category of or named visitor arriving at or departing from the building and the purpose(s) and/or outcome(s) of the visit. It may also be used, for example, to report a "site request" e.g. a repair required to a piece of equipment or the failure of a piece of equipment etc. and record it on-line to the central database.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
A purpose-built web browser enabled device, referred to as a "site terminal", located at a geographically remote building or site (and granted a unique internet address) is used to update and confirm, securely and unambiguously, the time and date of attendance of a visitor (assigned in advance a usename, password etc.) to the building or site in question on a central database accessible via the internet in "real time". That "site terminal" is securely attached to the building fabric.<br>
The web browser is designed to only allow interaction with a custom menu<br><br>
5<br>
(dependent upon the type of visitor) held on a remote web server with a central database to confirm and record details of the event, the nature and purpose of the event e.g. a "site request" made to a company contracted, in some form, to be carrying out maintenance, inspection, building or surveying services etc. and/or the outcome of the visit e.g. a request has been logged and a contactor arrives after a certain number of hours etc. These details are transferred directly to the database in "real time" using the web browser facility.<br>
In addition to tracking and recording details of site requests and the attendance of a diverse range of visitors, the database can be used by individuals in a building to record and monitor the status of site requests, the date/time of arrival and date/time of leaving and any outcome of visits by third parties. The central database can provide status information regarding any designated item of equipment, for example, or the response time of the attendance of a maintenance contractor to repair a fault or the time spent on site or outcome of a visit and whether any further work is needed after the visit etc.<br>
The building owners, managers and/or any other authorised party may also be given access to the remote web server and database via a suitable web browser together with appropriate usemame and password and can see in "real time" whether committed and pre-arranged or contracted visits have been made, the time spent on site by the visitor etc. as well as the number and frequency of unplanned or emergency visits, call backs, site requests, breakdown attendances etc. indeed any facet or aspect of the visits that have taken place at the site and been recorded.<br>
The use of a web browser in a similar fashion as described above by Owners, Tenants, Managing Agents, Contractors etc. enables them, via a custom menu, to report to the central database building defects, deficiencies or complaints to be actioned by contractors or others normally visiting the building under contract or by agreement with the building's owner or management. In addition, for example, the contractors' organisation can also set estimated times of arrival remotely for their attendance to the<br><br>
6<br>
site and monitor the response time of contractors staff etc. to actually attend the sites and to clear reported faults, defects, deficiencies etc. using the site terminal facility.<br>
This invention concerns a web browser based "real time" building visitor tracking system using a robust PC based "site terminal" with a unique internet address, which terminal is securely and permanently attached to the building fabric of the unique site concerned.<br>
The use of a combination of usernames and passwords etc, delegated to the visitor in advance, enables a database on a remote web server to record securely and unambiguously the time of an event, for example, the logging of a site request, arrival of an individual, or departure of an individual from the building of all categories of events and the gathering of sundry details from the events concerning the status, purpose and outcome of the event. The design of the web browser on the "site terminal" is modified in order that any user using the site terminal is only allowed to interact with the remote web server database in a controlled manner and access to any other web site other than the remote web server database is precluded.<br>
The combination of the web browser "site terminals" with their unique internet addresses located at each building being monitored and the geographically remote central database permanently connected to the internet allows building owners and managers to track and be updated in real time with confirmation of all the various types of events and the purpose of these events including but not limited to contracted maintenance services and/or statutory inspections etc. Confirmation of site events are thus achieved in a totally automated manner without recourse to paper based logbooks, log cards or attendance registers and the manual processing of data from them.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawing<br>
In order that the invention may be well understood an embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying<br>
diagrammatic drawing, which shows the interaction of the site terminal (minimum<br><br>
7<br>
one per building) over the internet and ability of all building staff and "visitors" to the building to interact with the database via the site terminal.<br>
The novelty of the system lies in the use of a web browser not just simply to provide internet access to a database but by the time/date stamping of that interaction and the site stamping of the user's location via the unique internet address programmed into each "site terminal" enabling the database to confirm securely and unambiguously the event, the building the event relates to and the nature of the event given that the "site terminal" is securely fixed to the fabric of the building in question.<br>
The site terminals 6,7, 8 could, if required, be a standard PC with keyboard but in the context of this invention currently consists of a 307mm diagonal SVGA TFT colour flat screen with a resistive coating touch screen capability and a Linux compatible keyboard overlay (sic "Virtual Keyboard") to allow user interaction. The PC is an intel P333MHz processor with 64Mb of dram, 2,1GB of hard disk with a 56k PCMCIA modem. It utilises the Red Hat Linux 6,1 operating system running Netscape 4,72 web browser facility. It is configured to boot up with its home page being the appropriate database web site.<br>
The concept of the site terminals 6,7, 8 at each building and the internet access 9 of all the different types of events via the site terminals 6,7, 8 to the central database 5 is depicted in the Figure. The remote interaction of other interested parties to enter and view data aad reports etc. eg. owners 1, managing agents 2, contractors 3 and any others 4, are also shown.<br>
In the context of this invention the central database 5 consists of a proprietary relational database supplied by the Commence Corporation "Commence 2000". "Commence 2000" is a relational database biased towards information management rather than numerical figures. It is classified as a RAD (rapid application development) tool. In addition customised Active Server Programming (ASP) has been carried out to work through the Commence Application Program Interface (API) to enable data to be interrogated and updated via standard web browsers using login<br><br>
8<br>
usernames and passwords to control access.<br>
By storing the internet addresses of the site terminals 6,7, 8 on the database 5 the use of the site terminals 6, 7, 8 as a web browser limits directly the interaction of the user on the database to the time/date stamping of that interaction and the site stamping of the user's location via the unique internet address programmed into each site terminal 6, 7, 8. Thus the database 5 can record securely and unambiguously the event, the building in which the event has taken place and the nature of the event and its outcome given that the site terminals 6, 7, 8 are securely fixed to the fabric of the buildings in question. Indeed any menu driven series of questions and answers can be provided directly by the database 5 knowing the site concerned and the type of event being queried. In addition the site terminals 6, 7, 8 may be used by the building staff as a means of accessing the remote web server database 5 and interrogating the data, for example, about estimated time of arrival set by contractors in response to building equipment repair requests made using the site terminals 6, 7, 8 and to get status updates generally.<br><br>
