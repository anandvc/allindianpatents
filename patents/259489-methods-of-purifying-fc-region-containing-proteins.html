METHODS OF PURIFYING Fc REGION CONTAINING PROTEINS<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to provisional patent application 'METHODS OF PURIFYING Fc REGION CONTAINING PROTEINS", filed June 17,2005 having serial number 60/691821, The entire content of this application is incorporated herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antibodies are powerful components of the immune system of many animals and especially humans. Recent advances in recombinant technology have allowed for the production of antibodies against virtually any target, for example, cancer cells, bacteria, and viruses. Typically, an antibody is produced using a cell line ihat has been engineered to express the antibody at high levels. The engineered cell line is subsequently grown in a culture that comprises a complex mixture of sugars, amino acids, and growth factors, as well as various proteins, including for example, serum proteins. However, separation of complete antibodies from cell by-products and culture components to a purity sufficient for use in research or as therapeutics poses a formidable challenge. The purification of the antibody molecules is especially critical if the antibodies are to be used as a drug for administration to humans.<br>
Traditional antibody purification schemes (or trains) often comprise a chromatography step which exploits an ability of the antibody molecule to preferentially bind or be retained by the solid phase (or functionalized solid phase) of a chromatography column compared to the binding or retention of various impurities. Schemes have been proposed or carried out to purify antibodies which first bind CH2/ CHS region-containing proteins to Protein A immobilized on a solid phase, followed by removal of impurities bound to the solid phase by washing the solid phase with a hydrophobic electrolyte solvent and the subsequent recovery of the CH2/ CH3 region-containing proteins from the sohd phase. However, these schemes are limited in that the conditions used to preferentially bind the CH2/ CH3 region-containing proteins also support binding of impurities {e.g., antibodies with incomplete CH2/CBB regions)- In the development of human therapeutics, such impurities are highly undesirable.<br><br>
Accordingly, a need exists for improvements in the purification of proteins or polypeptides having constant regions, in particular, proteins having Fc regions (e.g,, antibodies), produced in cell culture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In various aspects, the present invention features methods for separating a protein having an Fc region from a source liquid comprising the protein and one or more impurities. In the methods of the invention, the protein having an Fc region (the target protein) is adsorbed to an Fc binding agent and then the Fc binding agent is washed with a buffer solution containing a divalent cation salt to remove one or more impurities. The protein is then recovered from the Fc binding agent in an elution solution. The methods of the invention are particularly useful for removing impurities such as intron read through variant species (IRT), under disulfide bonded species (UDB) and/or low molecular weight variant species (LMW). The methods of the invention also are effective in removing impurities such as host cell proteins (HCP) and DNA.<br>
The methods of the present invention comprise one or more chromatographic separation steps and in addition can comprise one or more filtration steps. The chromatographic separation steps can be continuous or discontinuous (e.g., a batch approach), or a combination of both. la various embodiments, the methods comprise one or more filtration steps, for example, to remove viruses, concentrate and buffer the solution containing the target protein, and to remove microbial contaminants.<br>

Prior to further describing the invention, it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to set forth definitions of certain terms to be used herein. The definitions set forth herein have been grouped for ease of reference only and not by way of limitation.<br>
Protein Related Definitions<br>
In various aspects, the present invention provides methods for purifying an Fc region containing protein from a solution containing the protein and one or more read-through variants thereof, such as, for example, intron read-tbrough variants. In featured aspects, methods of the present invention are used to reduce the levels of one or more intron read-through (IRT) variant species in a protein preparation, for example, in an antibody prrparation. The terms "intron read-through variant," and "intron read-throuh variant species" are used interchangeably herein and refer to the product of a process where in the synthesis of the Fc region containing protein of interest (e.g.the target protein) polypeptide chain elongation is terminated prior to transcription of a coding region by a stop codon in the intron prior to the coding region. The result is a variant of the protein of interest (i.e., an intron read-through variant) with one or more incomplete or missing domains. Such introns can contain more than one stop codon resulting in the possibility of producing several different intron read-through variants.<br>
The term "under disulfide bonded variant"or 'UDB" refers to any species where at least one disulfide bond is missing. The missing disulfide bond can be either an interchain disulfide bond or an intrachain disulfide bond or a combination of the two.<br>

The terai "domain" refers to a globular region of a heavy or light chain polypeptide comprising peptide loops (e.g., comprising 3 to 4 peptide loops) stabilized, for example, by p-pleated sheet and/or intrachain disulfide bond. Domains are further referred to herein as "constant" or 'Variable", based on the relative lack of sequence variation within the domains of various class members in the case of a "constant" domain, or the significant variation within the domains of various class members in the case of a "Variable" domain. "Constant" domains on the light chain are referred to interchangeably as "light chain constant regions", "light chain constant domains", "CL" regions or "CL" domains). "Constant" domains on the heavy chain are referred to interchangeably as "heavy chain constant regions", "heavy chain constant domains", "CH" regions or "CH" domains).

immunoglobulin or antibody that binds antigen or competes with the intact antibody from which they were derived for specific antigen binding.<br>
The terms "antibody fusion protein" and "antibody fusion" refers to a fusion protein including all or a portion of an antibody fused to at least one non-antibody protein portion or polypeptide. Fusion is generally accomplished by genetic engineering of the gene encoding said protein. Additional exemplary antibody fusion proteins include the cell receptor binding portion of an antibody (including the Fc region) fused to all or a portion of another soluble or cellular biological protein, for example a receptor (cellular or soluble) or portion thereof, a cytokine or portion thereof, an enzyme or portion thereof, etc. Such antibody fusion proteins that comprise the Fc region of the antibody fused to another protein are also referred to in the art as Fc fusion proteins.<br>
The term "Fc binding agent" refers to a molecule that is capable of binding to the Fc region of an antibody (e.g., an IgG antibody) including, but not limited to, a complement protein, an Fc receptor or a bacterial-derived protein, such as Protein A or Protein G, that has high affinity for the Fc region of an antibody.<br>
The term Fc region" refers to a C-terminal region of an IgG antibody, in particular, the C-terminal region of the heavy chain(s) of said IgG antibody. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an IgG heavy chain can vary slightly, a Fc region is typically defined as spanning from about amino acid residue Cys226 to the carboxyl-terminus of an IgG heavy chain(s).<br>
Chromatography Related Definitions<br>
The term "source liquid", as used herein, refers to a liquid containing at least one target substance which is sought to be purified from other substances also present. Source liquids can, for example, be aqueous solutions, organic solvent systems, or aqueous/organic solvent mixtures or solutions. The source liquids are often complex mixtures or solutions containing many biological molecules (such as proteins, antibodies, hormones, and viruses), small molecules (such as salts, sugars, lipids, etc.) and even particulate matter. While a typical source hquid of biological origin may begin as an aqueous solution or suspension, it may also contain organic solvents used in earlier separation steps such as solvent precipitations, extractions, and the like. Examples of source Hquids that may contain valuable biological substances amenable to the purification by various embodiments the presort invention include, but are not limited<br><br>
to, a culture supernatant from a bioreactor, a homogenized cell suspension, plasma, plasma fractions, and milk.<br>
The term "target substance" or "target protein" refers herein to the one or more desired Fc region containingproteins to be purified from the source liquid. The target substance may be present in the source liquid as a suspension or in solution.<br>
The term "impurities" refers to materials in the source liquid that are different from the target substance(s) and are desirably excluded from the final target substance product(s). Typical impurities include nucleic acids, proteins (including intron-read-through species, low molecular weight species and under disulfide bonded species), peptides, endotoxins, viruses and small molecules.<br>
As used herein, the term "solid phase" refers to a non-aqueous matrix with which a target substance interacts during purification or to which an Fc binding agent can adhere. Suitable solid phase materials include, but are not limited to, glass, silica {e,g,, silica gel), polysaccharides (e.g., a polysaccharide matrix) such as agarose and cellulose, organic polymers such as polyacrylamide, methylmethacrylate, and polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymers such as for example AmberliteTM resin, (commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas Chemical Co., Philadelphia, Pa.). The solid phase can be selected from any of the groups of resins commonly described as aflSnity, ion exchange and ion capture resins. The solid phase can be, for example, a purification column, a discontinuous phase of discrete particles, or a combination thereof. The solid phase can be of porous or nonporous character, and can be compressible or incompressible. In various embodiments, the solid phase is a polymeric matrix or an agarose particle or bead. In various embodiments, the solid phase can be coated with a reagent (such as glycerol), for example, to prevent nonspecific adherence of impurities to the solid phase. An Fc binding solid phase need only possess a chemistry or an associated ligand that will permit Fc binding agent to adhere to the surface of the solid phase. Preferred solid phase materials will be physically and chemically resilient to the conditions employed in the purification process including pumping and cross-flow filtration, and temperatures, pH, and other aspects of the liquids employed.<br>
"Affinity ligand" refers to a moiety that binds selectively or preferentially to a component of the source liquid through a specific interaction with a binding site of the component. In the present invention, the affinity ligand (e.g., an Fc binding agent) is typically immobilized to a solid phase such as a resin. Examples of affinity ligands that<br><br>
can be bound to the resin support to provide' chromatography resins useful in the process of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Protem A, Protein G, and their analogs, which selectively bind to a protein Fc region. Methods of binding affinity ligands to solid support materials are well known in the purification art.

"Affinity chromatography resin" or "affinity resin" refers to a chromatography resin that comprises a solid phase or substrate with affinity ligands bound to its surfaces.<br>
"Ion exchange chromatography resin" or "ion exchange resin" refers to a solid support to which are covalently bound ligands that bear a positive or negative charge, and which thus has free counterions available for exchange with ions in a solution with which the ion exchange resin is contacted.<br>
"Cation exchange resins" refers to an ion exchange resin with covalently bound negatively charged ligands, and which thus has free cations for exchange with cations in a solution with which the resin is contacted. A wide variety of cation exchange resins are known in the art, for example, those wherein the covalently bound-groups are carboxylate or sulfonate. Commercially available cation exchange resins include CMC-cellulose, SP-SephadexTM, and Fast S-Sepharose™ (the latter two being commercially available from Pharmacia).<br>
"Anion exchange resins" refers to an ion exchange resin with covalently bound positively charged groups, such as quaternary amino groups. Commercially available anion exchange resins include DEAE cellulose, IMAE, QAE Sephadex™, and Fast Q Sepharose'™ (the latter two being commercially available from Pharmacia).<br>
As used herein, the term "chaotropoic salt" refers to a salt which comprises one or more ionic components that are low in the lyotropic series that are able to penetrate protein hydration shells and bind directly to their surfaces. This disrupts cohydrative association, favoring protein solubilization. Examples of chaotropic salts include, but are not limited to, halide salts of the Group H elements (e.g*., calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, barium chloride, calcium bromide, magnesium bromide, barium bromide, calcum iodide, magnesium iodide, barium iodide).<br><br><br>
A "buffer" is a substance which, by its presence in solution, increases the amount of acid or alkali that must be added to cause unit change in pH. A buffered solution resists changes in pH by the action of its acid-base conjugate components. Buffered solutions for use with biological reagents are generally capable of maintaining a constant concentration of hydrogen ions such that the pH of the solution is within aphysiological range. The term "physiological pH" refers to the pH of mammalian blood (/.e., 7.38 or about 7.4). Thus a physiologic pH range is from about 7.2 to 7.6. Traditional buffer components include, but are not limited to, organic and inorganic salts, acids and bases. Exemplary buffers for use in purification of biological molecules (e.g., protein molecules) include the zwittaionic or "Good" Buffers, see e,g,. Good et al (1966) Biochemistry 5:467 and Good and Izawa (1972) Methods Enzymol 24:62. Exemplary buffers include but are not limited to TES, MES, PIPES, HEPES, MOPS, MOPSO, TRICINE and BICINE.<br>
The "equilibration buffer" herein is a buffer used to prepare the Fc binding reagent, solid phase, or both, for loading of the source liquid containing the target protein. The equih'bration buffer is preferably isotonic and commonly has a pH in the range from about 6 to about 8. The "loading buffer" is a buffer used to load the source hquid containing the Fc region containing protein and impurities onto the solid phase to which the Fc binding agent is immobilized. Often, the equilibration and loading buffers are the same. The "elution buffer" is used to elute the Fc region-containing protein from the immobilized Fc binding agent. Preferably the elution buffer has a low pH and thereby disrupts interactions between the Fc binding agent and the protein of interest Preferably, the low pH elution buffer has a pH in the range from about 2 to about 5, most preferably in the range from about 3 to about 4. Examples of buffers that will control the pH within this range include glycine, phosphate, acetate, citrate and ammonium buffers, as well as combinations of these. The preferred such buffers are<br><br>
citrate and acetate buffers, most preferably sodium citrate or sodimn acetate buffers. Other elution buffers are contemplated including high pH buffers {e.g. those having a pH of 9 or more) or buffers comprising a compound or composition such as MgCl2 (2 mM) for eluting the protein of interest<br>
"Wash liquid" or "wash buffer" as used herein all refer herein to the liquid used to carry away impurities from the chromatography resin to which is bound the target substance. More than one wash liquid can be employed sequentially, e.g., with the successive wash liquids having varying properties such as pH, conductivity, solvent concentration, etc., designed to dissociate and remove varying types of impurities that are non-specifically associated with the chromatography resin.<br>
"Elution liquid" or "elution buffer" refers herein to the liquid that is used to dissociate the target substance from the chromatography resin after it has been washed with one or more wash liquids.   The elution liquid acts to dissociate the target substance wilhout denaturing it irreversibly. Typical elution liquids are well known in the chromatography art and may have higher concentrations of salts, free affinity ligands or analogs, or other substances that promote dissociation of the target substance from the chromatography resin. "Elution conditions" refers to process conditions imposed on the target substance-bound chromatography resin that dissociate the target substance from the chromatography resin, such as the contacting of the target substance-bound chromatography resin with an elution liquid or elution buffer to produce such dissociation.<br>
"Cleaning liquid" or "cleaning buffer" refers herein to the liquid that is used to wash the chromatography resin after the completion of the purification process. The cleaning liquid may contain a detergent, a vims-inactivating agent, or relatively high concentrations of salts, and may have a higher or lower pH than the liquids used during the purification process. Its purpose is to decontaminate the chromatography resin to render it ready for reuse. Typical cleaning Uquids are well-known in the chromatography art.<br>
"Storage liquid" or "storage buffer" refers herein to the Uquid in which the chromatography resin is suspended between uses. Storage Uquids, in addition to buffering ions, may also contain microbicides or other preservatives. Such storage Uquids are well known in the chromatography art.<br><br>
In various aspects, the present invention features methods for purifying a protein having an Fc region from a source liquid comprising the protein and one or more impurities by adsorbing the protein to an Fc binding agent, followed by washing the Fc binding agent with a buffer solution containing a divalent cation salt to remove one or more impurities, and subsequently recovering the protein from the Fc binding agent. Suitable Fc binding agents include, but are not limited to. Protein A and Protein G.<br>
The present invention features processes for the purification of Fc region containing proteins, for example, antibodies. Exemplary purification processes include an affinity chromatography step. The affinity chromatography step can be continuous, discontinuous, or a combination of both. For example, the affinity chromatography step can be performed as a discontinuous process, such as, for example, a batch process. Affinity chromatography is the process of bioselective adsorption and subsequent recovery of a target compound from an immobilized ligand. This process allows for the highly specific and efficient purification of the target compound. The process requires the utilization of an appropriately selective ligand (e,g,, Fc binding agent) which will bind the target compound (e.g., Fc region containing protein) generally with a dissociation constant in the range of 10-4 to 10-8, while permitting recovery under mild conditions. The Ugand is generally immobilized on a beaded and porous matrix which may be in the form of a column packing or batchwise adsorption medium.<br>
A preferred binding agent is Protein A. Protein A binds the Fc region of immunoglobulins. Protein A consists of six regions, five of which bind IgG. It binds with high affinity to human IgGi, IgGa and IgG4, as well as mouse IgG2a, IgGab and IgG3. Protein A binds with moderate affinity to human IgD, IgM, IgA and IgE as well as mouse IgGi. As an affinity ligand. Protein A is immobilized to a matrix so that these regions are free to bind. One molecule of immobilized Protein A can bind at least two molecules of IgG. Native and recombinant visions of Protein A share similar specificity for the Fc region of IgG. Recombinant Protein A (rProtein A) can be engineered to include, for example, a C-terminal cysteine, and can be immobilized via thioetser coupling to a solid phase matrix. Such coupling results in enhanced binding capacity of the protein A.<br>
An alternative binding agent is Protein G. Protein G is specific for IgG, binding with high affinity for human IgG1, IgG2, IgGs and IgG4, as well as mouse IgGi and IgG3. Protein G PLUS has moderate affinity for human IgG4 and mouse IgGaa, IgG2b and IgGa.<br><br>
Recombinant protein G (rProteinG) can be engineered to delete the albumin-binding region of the native protein. Recombinant Protein G contains two Fc binding regions.<br>
An alternative binding agent is Protein A/G. Protein A/G is a genetically-engineered protein that combines the IgG binding profiles of both Protein A and Protein G. It is a gene fusion product secreted from a nonpathogenic form of Bacillus. Protein A/G contains four Fc binding domains from Protein A and two from Protein G. Protein A/G is not as pH dependent as Protein A, but otherwise has the additive properties of Protein A and G.<br>
Protein A/G binds to all human IgG subclasses, particularly suitable for purification of polyclonal or monoclonal IgG antibodies whose subclasses have not been determined. In addition, it binds to IgA, IgE, IgM and (to a lesser extent) IgD. Protem A/G also binds well to all mouse IgG subclasses, particularly suitable for purification of mouse monoclonal antibodies from IgG subclasses, without interference from IgA, IgM and murine serum albmnin. (See e.g;, Sikkema. (1989) Amer, Biotech. Lab 7,42.) Individual subclasses of mouse monoclonals can have a stronger affinity for the chimeric Protein A/G than to either Protein A or Protein G, (See e.g,, Eliasson et al (1988)7. Bio, Chem, 263,4323-4327.)<br>
In the present invention, the immobilized Fc binding agent (e.g-. Protein A) is washed with a divalent cation salt solution to remove impurities. In particular, it has been discovered that undesirable impurities produced as a result of recombinant antibody expression technologies can be removed using a divalent cation salt wash step.<br>
The methods of the present invention can optionally include purification steps subsequent to the affinity chromatography and divalent cation wash step. Subsequent purification steps can include an ion exchange chromatography step and/or a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) step. Subsequent chromatography steps can be continuous, discontinuous (e.g-, such as a batch process), or a combination of both. Ion exchange chromatography separates molecules based on differences between the overall charge of the proteins. The target protein must have a charge opposite that of the functional group attached to the resin in order to bind. For example, antibodies, which generally have an overall positive charge, will bind well to cation exchangers, which contain negatively charged functional groups. Because this interaction is ionic, binding must take place under low ionic conditions. Elution is achieved by increasing the ionic strength to break up the ionic interaction, or by changing the pH of the protein.<br><br>
Whereas ion exchange chromatography relies on the charges of proteins to isolate them, hydrophobic interaction chromatography uses the hydrophobic properties of some proteins. Hydrophobic groups on the protein bind to hydrophilic groups on the column. The more hydrophobic a protein is, the stronger it will bind to the column. The HIC step removes, for example, host cell derived impurities {e,g., DNA and other high and low molecular weight product-related species). Further purification steps can include virus removing steps as well as ultrafiltration and/or diafiltration steps, as described herein.<br>
In various embodiments, the Fc region containing protein is an antibody or an antibody fusion protein having an Fc region that binds to an Fc receptor of the Fc binding agent. The use of the buffer solution containing a divalent cation salt to wash the Fc binding agent allows for greater removal of impurities, such as, for example, read-through variants and constant region containing fragments (including LMW and UDB species), of the protein of interest (e.g., the target substance in the source liquid).<br>
The methods of the present invention comprise one or more chromatographic separation steps and in addition can comprise one or more filtration steps for separating a protein having an Fc region ("the target protein") from impurities in a source liquid.   ' For example, the source liquid may be filtered, centrifixged or otherwise processed to remove particulate debris and the like before contacting the source liquid with the Fc binding agent. For example, using recombinant techniques, proteins can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or secreted directly into the culture medium. If the protein is produced intracellularly, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, can be removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the protein is secreted into the medium, the recombinant host cells can be sqparated from the cell culture medium, for example, by tangential flow filtration.<br>
In various embodiments, the source liquid containing the target protein is contacted with an Fc binding agent (preferably immobilized on a solid phase and equilibrated with a suitable buffer) such that the target protein adsorbs to the Fc binding agent (e.g., an immobilized Fc binding agent). The source Uquid is contacted with the Fc binding agent (ag-,, an immobilized Fc binding agent) in a loading buffer which may be the same as the equilibration buffer. As the impurity-containing source liquid flows through the solid phase, the target protein is adsorbed to the Fc binding agent and various other impurities (such as host cell proteins, where the target protein is produced<br><br>
in a recombinant host cell, or other process-derived impurities) flow-through or bind nonspecifically to the solid phase. In various embodiments, the Fc binding agent is Protein A, and the equilibration buffer can be 20 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5. Other suitable equilibration buffers include, for example, BIS, HEPES, etc., at physiological concentrations, for example, concentration in the range between about 0.5 mM and about 100 mM (e.g, 10 mM, 20 mM, 50 mM, etc.), and physiological salt concentrations (e,g,, about 0.15 mM NaCl), and at pH from 5.0-9.0.<br>
The sohd phase is preferably an agarose (e.g-., Sepharose) bead or particle for iiumobiliziag the Fc binding agent In various embodiments, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to decrease or prevent nonspecific adherence to the column. In various embodiments, the Fc binding agent is Protein A. The rmp Protein A Sepharose"™ Fast Flow (FF) column, commercially available from Amersham Biosciences, is an example of a suitable Protein A column for use in the featured mcthodologies.<br>
The Fc binding agent is then washed with a buffered wash solution containing a divalent cation salt to remove protein variant species bound to the solid phase or Fc binding agent, Jn particular, it has been discovered that the use of a divalent cation salt wash step can remove a significant amount of undesirable impurities. Specifically, it has been discovered that intron read-through variants, low molecular weight variants and under-disulfide bonded variants of a target protein can be removed using a divalent cation salt wash. Moreover, host cell proteins (HCP) and DNA also can be removed using the divalent cation salt wash. In various embodiments, the divalent cation salt in the wash solution contains a chaotropic salt. Examples of suitable chaotropic salts include, but are not limited to, calcium chloride (CaCl2, nickel chloride (NiCl2) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2).  While a single divalent cation salt can be present in the wash solution, in various embodiments, two or more divalent cation salts can be used.<br>
In various embodiments, wash solutions in addition to the divalent cation salt containing wash solution are used to remove impurities. For example, in various embodimmts a 20 to 50 mM Tris, 0.75 to 2.0 M NaCl, pH 5.0-9.0 solution, and/or a 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 solution are used to wash the Fc binding agent prior to, after, or both prior to and after, washing Fc binding agent with the divalent cation salt containing wash solution.<br><br>
In various embodiments, the divalent cation salt is preferably added at a concentration between about 0.5 M and about 2.5 M to a pH buffered solution having a pH in the range from about 5 to about 9, and preferably a pH in the range from about 7 to about 8, Preferred concentrations of the divalent cation salt include, but are not limited to, 0.6 M, 2.0 M and 2.5 M. Suitable buffers for this purpose include, but are not limited to, Tris or acetate buffers in a concentration from 20 to 50 mM.<br>
Following the washing step(s), the target protein is recovered from the Fc binding agent. This is normally achieved using a suitable elution buffer. The target protein can, for example, be eluted from the column using an elution buffer having a low pH, e,g. in the range from about 2 to about 6.5, and preferably in the range from about 2,5 to about 3.5.<br>
In various embodiments, the target protein thus recovered can be formulated in a phaimaceutically acceptable carrier and used for various diagnostic, therapeutic or other uses known for such molecules.<br>
In various embodiments, the eluted target protein preparation can be subjected to additional purification steps after the Fc binding agent chromatography step. For example, exemplary further purification steps include, but are not limited to: anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), hydroxyapatite chromatography, dialysis, affinity chromatography (including immobilized metal affinity chromatography), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ammonium sulphate precipitation, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), chromatofocusing, ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and gel filtration. In various embodiments, the Fc binding agent chromatography step is followed by an anion exchange chromatography and a HIC step. In various embodiments, the chromatography steps are further followed by a virus filtration step, an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step, and a microbial contaminant filtration step. In various embodiments, these additional purification steps may be conducted prior to the Fc binding agent chromatography step. In various aspects, the methods herein involve purifying an Fc region-containing protein from impurities by Protein A chromatography.<br>
In various embodiments, methods for purification of an Fc region containing protein (the target protein) begin with adsorbing the target protein to an Fc binding agent comprising Protein A immobilized on a sohd phase, followed by washing the Fc binding ageat with a buffer solution containing a divalent cation salt to remove one or more<br><br>
impurities, and subsequently recovering the protein from the Protein A to produce a first eluent pool.<br>
In various embodiments, the purification process continues with subjecting the first eluent pool to anion exchange chromatography by contacting an anion exchange resin with the first eluent pool such that impurities adsorb to the resin, while the target protein does not adsorb to the resin. Thus, the target protein can be recovered from the flow- through to produce a second eluent pool. In various embodiments, the anion exchange chromatography step further comprises washing the anion exchange resin with a buffered wash solution to recover at least a portion of the adsorbed target protein, which would then be combined with the second eluent pool. Altematively, the first eluent pool may be contacted with the anion exchange resin in such a way that the antibody adsorbs, allowing any impurities to flow-through, optionally followed by washing and eluting the adsorbed antibody.<br>
In various embodiments, the purification process continues with subjecting the second eluent pool to HIC by adsorbing the target protein to a hydrophobic interaction resin (e.g., a solid phase functionalized with hydrophobic ligands), washing the hydrophobic interaction resin with a buffered wash solution with an ionic strength which does not substantially elute the target protein, and recovering the target protein (typically using an elution buffer with an ionic strength low enough to desorb the target protein from the hydrophobic interaction resin) on a third eluent pool. Altematively, the second eluent pool may be contacted with the HIC column in such a way that the target protein does not adsorb, recovering the flow-through target protein as a third eluent pool.<br>
In various embodiments, the purification process includes one or more filtration steps, for example, to remove viruses, concentrate and buffer the solution containing the target protein, and to remove microbial contaminants.<br>
In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods for the purification of a protein having an Fc region from a source liquid comprising the protein and one or more impurities where the impurities comprise one or more IRT variants. In one embodiment, the methods provide for about a 2 to about a 20 fold reduction in IRT variant levels from those in the source liquid Preferably, IRT variant levels are reduced by at least 5 fold, and more preferably IRT variant levels are reduced by at least 10 fold.

For example, in a source liquid (starting sample) having about 20% UDB antibody variants (as a percentage of total species in the source liquid) UDB antibody variant species can be reduced to about 10% to about 2%. In various embodiments, UDB variant species are reduced to: less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 2%, or less than 1%.

For example, in a source liquid (starting sample) having about 3-5% LMW antibody variants (as a percentage of total species in the source liquid) LMW antibody variant species can be reduced to about 0.3 to about 0.5 %. In various embodiments, LMW variant species are reduced to: less than 1 %, less than 0.8%, less than 0.5 %, less than 0.3 %, less than 0.2 %, and/or less than 0.1 %.

Proteins for use in the Purification Methods of the Invention<br>
The protein having an Fc region to be purified according to the invention as described herein is prepared using techniques which are well established in the art and include, for example, synthetic techniques (such as recombinant techniques and peptide synthesis or a combination of these techniques), or maybe isolated from an endogenous source of the protein. In certain embodiments of the invention, the protein having an Fc region is an antigen-binding polypeptide, more preferably, an antibody. The antibody can be, for example, a polyclonal antibody preparation, a monoclonal antibody, a recombinant antibody, a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody or a human antibody. Techniques for the production of an antigen-binding polypeptide, and in particular, antibodies, are described below. Alternatively, the protein having an Fc region can be a modified form of an antibody, such as a bispecific antibody, an antibody conjugate or an antibody fusion protein (e.g., an Fc fusion protein). Techniques for the production of<br><br>
such modified forms of antibodies and antibody fusion proteins also are described below.<br>
Polyclonal Antibodies<br>
Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by immunizing a suitable subject with an immunogen. The antibody titer in the immunized subject can be monitored over time by standard techniques, such as with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized target antigen. If desired, the antibody molecules directed against the target antigen can be isolated fix)m the mammal (for example, from the blood) and further purified by well known techniques, such as protein A Sepharose chromatography to obtain the antibody, for example, IgG, fi-action. At an appropriate time after immunization, for example, when the anti-antigen antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497) (see also. Brown et al (1981) /. Immunol 127:539-46; Brown et al (1980) J. Biol Chem .255:4980-83; Yeh et al (1976) Proc, Natl Acad. Set USA 76:2927-31; and Yeh et al (1982) Int, J. Cancer 29:269-75). For the preparation of chimeric polyclonal antibodies, see Buechler et al U.S. Patent No. 6,420,113.<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
Any of the many well known protocols used for fusing lymphocytes and immortalized cell lines can be applied for the purpose of generating a monoclonal antibody (see, for example, G. GaLfre et al (1977) Nature 266:55052; Geftor et al Somatic Cell Genet, cited supra; Lemer, Yale J. Biol Med, cited supra; Kenneth, Monoclonal Antibodies, cited supra). Moreover, the ordinarily skilled worker will appreciate that there are many variatiotxs of such methods which also would be useful. Typically, the immortal cell line (for example, a myeloma cell line) is derived from the same mammalian species as the lymphocytes. For example, murine hybridomas can be made by fusing lymphocytes from a mouse immunized with an inmunogenic preparation of the present invention with an immortalized mouse cell line. Preferred immortal cell lines are mouse myeloma cell lines that are sensitive to culture medium containing hypoxauthine, aminopterin and thymidine ("HAT medium"). Any of a<br><br>
number of myeloma cell lines can be used as a fusion partner according to standard techniques, for example, the P3-NSl/l-Ag4-l, P3-x63-Ag8.653 or Sp2/0-Agl4 myeloma lines. These myeloma lines are available from ATCC. Typically, HAT-sensitive mouse myeloma cells are fused to mouse splenocytes using polyethylene glycol ("PEG"), Hybridoma cells resulting from the fusion are then selected using HAT medium, which kills unfused and unproductively fizsed myeloma cells (unfused splenocytes die after several days because they are not transformed). Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supematants for antibodies that bind a target antigen using a standard ELIS A assay.<br>
Recombinant Antibodies<br>
Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (for example, an antibody phage display library) with a target antigen to thereby isolate immunoglobulin library members that bind the target antigen. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (for example, the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SuffZAP'™ Phage Display Kit, Catalog No. 240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, Ladner et al U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Kang et al PCT International Publication No. WO 92/18619; Dower et al PCT International Publication No. WO 91/17271; Winter et al PCT International Publication WO 92/20791; Markland et al PCT International Publication No. WO 92/15679; Breitlmg et al PCT Intemational Publication WO 93/01288; McCafferty et al PCT Intemational Publication No. WO 92/01047; Garrard et al PCT Intemational Publication No. WO 92/09690; Ladner et al PCT International PubUcation No. WO 90/02809; Fuchs et al (1991) Bio/Technology 9:1370-1372; Hay et al (1992) Hum, Antibod Hybridomas 3:81-85; Huse et al (1989) Science 246:1275A2il; Griffiths et a/. {1993) EMBO J 12:725-734] Hawkins et el (1992) J.

Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies<br>
Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term humamzed immunoglobulin" or "humanized antibody" refers to an immunoglobulin or antibody that includes at least one humanized immunoglobulin or antibody chain (i.e., at least one humanized light or heavy chain). The term "humanized immunoglobulin chain" or "humanized antibody chain" (i.e., a "humanized immunoglobulin hght chain" or humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain") refers to an immunoglobulin or antibody chain (z.e,, a Ught or heavy chain, respectively) having a variable region that includes a variable framework region substantially from a human immunoglobuUn or antibody and complementarity detemining regions (CDRs) (for example, at least one CDR, preferably two ODRs, more preferably three CDRs) substantiaUy from a non-human immunoglobulin or antibody, and further includes constant regions (for example, at least one constant region or portion thereof, in the case of a Ught chain, and three constant regions in the case of a heavy chain). The term 'humanized variable region" (for example, "humanized Ught chain variable region" or "humanized heavy chain variable region") refers to a variable region that includes a variable framework region substantially from a human immunoglobulin or antibody and complementarity detennining regions (CDRs) substantiaUy from a non-human immunoglobulin or antibody.<br>
The phrase "substantially from a human immunoglobulin or antibody" or "substantially human" means that, when aligned to a human immunoglobulin or antibody amino sequence for comparison purposes, the region shares at least 80-90%, 90-95%, or 95-99% identity (i.e., local sequence identity) with the human framework or constant region sequence, allowing, for example, for conservative substitutions, consensus sequence substitutions, germline substitutions, backmutations, and the Uke. The introduction of conservative substitutions, consensus sequence substitutions, germline substitutions, backmutations, and the like, is often referred to as "optimization"<br><br>
of a humanized antibody or chain.  The phrase "substantially from a non-human immunoglobulin or antibody" or "substantially non-human" means having an immunoglobulin or antibody sequence at least 80-95%, preferably at least 90-95%, more preferably, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to that of a non-human organism, for example, a non-human mammal.<br>
Accordingly, all regions or residues of a humanized immunoglobulin or antibody, or of a humanized immunoglobulin or antibody chain, except the CDRs, are substantially identical to the corresponding regions or residues of one or more native human immunoglobulin sequences. The term "corresponding region" or "corresponding residue" refers to a region or residue on a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence which occupies the same (i.e., equivalent) position as a region or residue on a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence, when the first and second sequences are optimally aligned for comparison purposes.<br>
The term "significant identity" means that two polypeptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 50-60% sequence identity, preferably at least 60-70% sequence identity, more preferably at least 70-80% sequence identity, more preferably at least 80-90% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 90-95% sequence identity, and even more preferably at least 95% sequence identity or more (for example, 99% sequence identity or more). The term "substantial identity" means that two polypeptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80-90% sequence identity, preferably at least 90-95% sequence identity, and more preferably at least 95% sequence identity or more (for example, 99% sequence identity or more). For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.<br>
Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, for example, by the local homology algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, Adv, Appl Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, J. Mol Biol. 48:443<br><br>
(1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, Proc, Nat 7. Acad, Set USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Compute Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al Current Protocols in Molecular Biology). One example of algorithm that is suitable for detennining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al, J. Mol Biol 215:403 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (publicly accessible through the National Institutes of Health NCBI internet server). Typically, default program parameters can be used to perform the sequence comparison, although customized parameters can also be used. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlengih (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff &amp; Henikoff, Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 89:10915 (1989)).<br>
Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. For purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or nonconservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic sidechains): leu, met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr; Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gin, his, lys, arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another.<br>
Preferably, humanized immunoglobulins or antibodies bind antigen with an affinity that is within a factor of three, four, or five of that of the corresponding non-humanized antibody. For example, if the nonhumanized antibody has a binding affinity of 10-9 M, humanized antibodies will have a blading affinity of at least 3 x 10-8 M, 4 x 10" M, 5 X 10" M, or 10-9 M. An immunoglobulin chain is said to "direct antigen binding" when it confers upon an intact immunoglobulin or antibody (or antigen binding fi:agment thereof) a specific binding property or binding affinity. A mutation (for example, a backmutation) is said to substantially affect the ability of a heavy or light chain to direct antigen binding if it affects (for example, decreases) the binding affinity of an intact immunoglobulin or antibody (or antigen binding firagment thereof)<br><br>
comprising said chain by at least an order of magnitude compared to that of the antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) comprising an equivalent chain lacking said mutation. A mutation "does not substantially affect (for example, decrease) the ability of a chain to direct antigen binding" if it affects (for example, decreases) the binding affinity of an intact immnunoglobulin or antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) comprising said chain by only a factor of two, three, or four of that of the antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) comprising an equivalent chain lacking said mutation.<br>
The term "chimeric immunoglobulin" or antibody refers to an immunoglobulin or antibody whose variable regions derive from a first species and whose constant regions derive from a second species. Chimeric immunoglobulins or antibodies can be constmcted, for example by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin gene segments belongmg to different species. The terms "humanized immunoglobulin" or 'humanized antibody" are not intended to encompass chimeric immunoglobulins or antibodies, as defined infra. Although humani2ed immunoglobulins or antibodies are chimeric in then construction (i.e., comprise regions from more than one species of protein), they include additional features (i.e., variable regions comprising donor CDR residues and acceptor framework residues) not found in chimeric inmnmoglobulins or antibodies, as defined herein.<br>
Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in Robinson et al International Application No. PCTAJS86/02269; Akira, et al European Patent Application 184,187; Taniguchi* M., European Patent Application 171,496; Morrison et al European Patent AppUcation 173,494; Neuberger et al PCT International Publication No. WO 86/01533; Cabillyera/.

Human Antibodies from Transgenic Animals and Phage Display<br>
Alternatively, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (for example, mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and genn-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobuUn gene array in such germ-line mutant mice results in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos, 6,150,584; 6,114,598; and 5,770,429.<br>
Fully human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries (Hoogenboom et al, J. MoL Bioh, 227:381 (1991); Marks et al, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991)). Chimeric polyclonal antibodies can also be obtained from phage display libraries (Buechler et al U.S. Patent No. 6,420,113).<br>
Bisvecific Antibodies and Antibody Conjugates<br>
Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Such antibodies can be derived from full length antibodies or antibody fragments (for example F(ab)'2 bispecific antibodies). Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et a/., Natuie, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of different antibody molecules (see, WO 93/08829 and in Traunecker et al, EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991)).<br>
Bispecific antibodies also include cross-linked or "heteroconjugate" antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the hetoroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin or other payload. Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the antibody can beconjugated, chemically or genetically, to a payload such as a reactive, detectable, or functional moiety, for<br><br>
example, an immunotoxin to produce an antibody conjugate. Such payloads include, for example, immunotoxms, chemotherapeutics, and radioisotopes, all of which are well-known in the art.<br>
Antibody Fusion Proteins<br>
A protein having an Fc region as used in the invention can be a fusion protein that contains at least the Fc portion of an antibody fused to a non-antibody protein or polypeptide. For example, the Fc region can be fused to a ligand for a receptor such that a soluble fusion protein is created that is capable of binding the receptor and that has Fc-related functions (such as serum stability, Fc receptor binding and the like). Alternatively, the Fc region can be fused to the extracellular domain of a receptor such that a soluble fusion protein is created that is capable of binding the ligand for the receptor (thereby competing with the native receptor) and that has Fc-related functions. A non-limiting example of such an Fc fusion protein is etanercept (Embrel®), which comprises the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TNFa receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgGl. Antibody fusion proteins (also referred to in the art as Fc fusion proteins or Ig fusion proteins) can be prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques and have been described in the art, see for example U.S. Patent No. 5,116,964, U,S. Patent No. 5,225,538, U.S. Patent No. 5,336,603 and U.S. Patent No. 5,428,130, all by Capon et al<br>
Anti IL'13 Antibodies<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the protein having an Fc region to be purified according to the invention is an anti-IL-13 antibody. Anti-IL-13 antibodies are described in U.S. Provisional Applications Serial Nos. 60/578,473, filed June 9, 2004 and 60/581,375, filed June 22,2004, both titled "Antibodies against human IL-13 and uses thereof." The contents of these applications are incorporated by reference. A preferred anti-IL-13 antibody may variously be referred to as 'TMA" herein.<br>
Antibodies that are capable of binding to, neutralizing and/or inhibiting one or more IL-13-a^sociated activities, particularly the signaling activity of IL-13, are usefiil for treating IL-13-mediated diseases, such as allergic asthma, nonallergic asthma, and<br>
asthma-related pathologies, such as fibrosis, eosinophilia, and mucus production.<br>
1<br><br>
IL-13 binding agents that are EL-13 antagonists, including antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind to IL-13, in particular, human IL-13, with high affinity and specificity. The antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present disclosure are also referred to herein as "anti-IL-13 antibodies" and "fragments thereof" respectively. In one embodiment, the anti-IL-13 antibody or fragment thereof reduces, neutralizes, and/or antagonizes at least one IL-13-associated activity- For example, the anti-IL-13 antibody or fragment thereof can bind to IL-13, e.g., an epitope of IL-13, and interfere with an interaction, e.g., binding, between IL-13 and an IL-13 receptor complex ("IL-13R"), e.g., a complex comprising IL-13 receptor ("IL-lSRal") and the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain ("IL-4Ra"), or a subunit thereof {e.g,, IL-13Ral or IL-4Ra, individually). Thus, the antibodies and fragments thereof described herein can be used to interfere with (e.g., inhibit, block or otherwise reduce) an interaction, e.g-., binding, between IL-13 and an IL-13 receptor complex, or a subunit thereof:  thereby interfering with the formation of a functional signaling complex.<br>

Other preferred Fc region containing proteins include antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans. Such antibodies include antibodies that bind to a tumor cell antigen, antibodies that bind to a cytokine, antibodies that bind to a cytokine receptor and antibodies that bind to an adhesion protein.

Pi'oduction of Tarset Protein<br>
The target Fc containing proteins can be produced by standard expression methods, e.g., using a recombinant mammalian cell line grown in suspension culture. Conditioned medium contaiaing the Fc containing protein of interest is generated in a production bioreactor. The resulting product may be harvested and clarified with any appropriate clarification step such as, for example, either microfiltration and 0.22 µm filtration or centrifugation, pad filtration and 0.22 µm filtration.<br>
Purification of tarset protein<br>
The purification of the target monoclonal antibodies exemplified herein (AAB, 12A11 and MA) consists of capture of the target molecule on protein A affinity chromatography. This can consist of rmp Protein A SepharoseTM Fast Flow, Protein A SepharoseTM Fast Flow, or MabSelect Protein A. The resin is then washed as described for each of the experiments and the product eluted and tested for impurity levels.<br>
Analysis oftarset protein<br>
Reversed-Phase HPLC (EIP-HPLC) was used to quantitate the amount of IRT present in the AAB monoclonal antibody samples, while Pro A HPLC method was employed to determine IRT levels for the IMA monoclonal antibody. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLQ was used to determine the percentage of monomeric protein (monomeric IgG), high molecular weight (HMW), and low molecular weight (LMW) species. Denaturing SEC-HPLC analysis was carried out to determine the relative amount of Under-Disulfide Bonded (UDB) species in samples. The levels of HCP in the test samples were determined using an Enzyme-Linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).<br>

The product pool was then neutralized to 7.9-8.1 with 2 M Tris pH 8.5. The columns were then stripped, washed and stored. Table 3 lists the levels of the IRT species &amp; LMW present in the product pools from the various runs.<br><br>

The MabSelect Protein A column was equilibrated with 5 colunm volumes of 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The columns were then loaded at approximately 10 mg product/mL resin. This was followed by a 2 column volume flush with equilibration buffer and 5 column volumes of wash 1 solution. This wash 1 solution consisted of 50 mM Tris, 2.0 M CaCl2, pH 7.5 for run 1, while it was left out entirely for run 2. Wash 1 was then followed by 5 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, 1.0 M NaCl, pH 7.5 and 5 column volumes of 10 mM Tris, 75 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The monoclonal antibody was eluted from the MabSelect Protein A column with 50 mM Glycine, 25 mM NaCl, pH 3,1. The product pool was then neutralized to 7.8-8.2 with 2 M Tris pH 8.5. The columns were then stripped, washed and stored. The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3: IRT Removal (IMA)<br>
In this example, a different monoclonal antibody (IMA) from that used in Example 1 was used in a small scale purification with a CaCl2 wash.<br>

The MabSelect Protein A column was equilibrated with 5 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The column was loaded at approximately 40 mg product/mL resiti. The remaining load was flushed out of the colmnn with 5 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The colunm was then washed with one of the solutions described in Table 11. Prior to elution the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The product was eluted from the MabSelect Protein A column with 50 mM Glycine, 10 mM NaCl, pH 3.0. The product pool was then neutralized to pH 8.0 with 2 M Tris pH 9.0. The colunm was stripped with 5 colunm volinnes 50 mM NaOH, 0.5 M Na2S04 then stored with 5 column volumes of 16% ethanol, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, The results are shown in Table 11 (HCP removal) and Table 12 (IRT removal).<br><br><br><br>
Table 11 shows that the level of HCPs present in runs that were washed with solutions containing divalent cations had 1.5-3.5 fold less HCPs than the control (1.0 M NaCl Wash). Table 12 shows that the runs that contained the washes with divalent cationic salts solutions also provide &gt; 3.5 fold IRT removal compared to the run with a 1.0 M NaCl containing wash solutions. Thus, these results demonstrated that salt washes with other divalent cations {e.g., with MnCla or NiCl2), different than CaCl2, also were effective in removing impurities.<br>
