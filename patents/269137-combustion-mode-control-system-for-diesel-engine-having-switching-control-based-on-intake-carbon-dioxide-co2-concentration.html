CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) CONCENTRATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/966,864, filed on August 30,2007.<br>
[0002] This application is related to United States Patent Application<br>
No. 11/466,902 filed on August 24, 2006. The disclosures of the above<br>
applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0003] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems for<br>
vehicles, and more specifically to combustion mode control systems for diesel<br>
engines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0005] Diesel engines may be operated in a conventional combustion<br>
mode and a Premixed Compression Ignition (PCI) combustion mode. PCI is an<br>
advanced diesel combustion technique that may reduce diesel engine emissions.<br>
With PCI, fuel is injected into the combustion chamber of the cylinder much<br>
earlier in the combustion stroke than would be done for conventional diesel<br>
combustion. The desired fuel amount is supplied significantly before the piston<br><br>
reaches the compression top dead center (TDC). The early injected fuel is mixed<br>
sufficiently with the air before the piston reaches the compression TOC. Thus,<br>
the technique provides a lean and well mixed state of air/fuel mixture before<br>
ignition.<br>
[0006] A diesei engine may be switched from a conventional<br>
combustion mode to PCI combustion mode during low-load operating conditions.<br>
Therefore, engine load conditions may be monitored to ensure that the<br>
combustion mode is switched to PCI combustion mode at low load conditions.<br>
However, switching to PCI combustion mode even at low engine load conditions<br>
may result in high NOx emissions without appropriate combustion gas conditions.<br>
[0007] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] Accordingly, a method of switching a combustion mode of a<br>
diesei engine may include determining a carbon dioxide concentration in an<br>
intake manifold of a diesei engine, operating the diesei engine in a first<br>
combustion mode, and operating the diesei engine in a second combustion mode<br>
when the determined carbon dioxide concentration is greater than a<br>
predetermined carbon dioxide concentration value.<br><br>
[0009] A control module for switching a combustion mode of a diesel<br>
engine may include a carbon dioxide concentration determination module and a<br>
combustion mode switching module. The carbon dioxide concentration<br>
determination module may be configured to determine a concentration of carbon<br>
dioxide in an intake manifold of the diesel engine. The combustion mode<br>
switching module may be in communication with the carbon dioxide<br>
concentration determination module and may be configured to switch operation<br>
of the diesel engine between first and second combustion modes based on the<br>
determined concentration of carbon dioxide from the carbon dioxide<br>
concentration determination module.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide<br>
the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 is schematically<br>
illustrated. Vehicle 10 may include a diesel engine 12 in communication with an<br>
intake system 14, an exhaust system 16, a fuel system 18 and an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation (EGR) system 20. Intake system 14 may include an intake manifold<br>
22 and a throttle 24. Throttle 24 may control an air flow into engine 12 and fuel<br>
system 18 may control a fuel flow into engine 12. Exhaust gas created by<br>
combustion of the air/fuel mixture may exit engine 12 through exhaust system 16.<br>
Exhaust system 16 may include an exhaust manifold 26 in communication with a<br>
catalyst 28 and a diesel participate filter (DPF) 30.<br>
[0018] EGR system 20 may provide selective communication between<br>
intake system 14 and exhaust system 16. EGR system 20 may include an EGR<br>
valve 32 and an EGR line 34. EGR valve 32 may be mounted on intake manifold<br>
22 and EGR line 34 may extend from exhaust manifold 26 to EGR valve 32<br>
providing communication between exhaust manifold 26 and EGR valve 32.<br><br>
Additionally, engine 12 may include a turbocharger (not shown). The<br>
turbocharger may be in communication with both the exhaust system 16 and<br>
intake system 14. The turbocharger may be driven by the exhaust system 16<br>
and may provide an increased air flow rate to intake system 14.<br>
[0019] Vehicle 10 may further include a control module 36 in<br>
communication with fuel system 18, throttle 24 and EGR valve 32. Control<br>
module 36 may additionally be in communication with a mass air flow (MAF)<br>
sensor 38, an intake manifold pressure sensor 40, and an exhaust manifold<br>
pressure sensor 42.<br>
[0020] MAF sensor 38 provides a signal to control module 36 indicative<br>
of the air flow rate into intake manifold 22. Intake manifold pressure sensor 40<br>
provides a signal to control module 36 indicative of the air pressure in intake<br>
manifold 22 and exhaust manifold pressure sensor 42 provides a signal to control<br>
module 36 indicative of the air pressure in exhaust manifold 26.<br>
[0021] Figure 2 depicts that control module 36 may include a load<br>
determination module 44, a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration determination<br>
module 46, a combustion mode switching module 48, an air control module 50, a<br>
fuel control module 52, and an EGR module 54. Load determination module 44<br>
may be in communication with combustion mode switching module 48 and may<br>
provide information regarding a load on engine 12, as discussed below. CO2<br>
concentration determination module 46 may be in communication with<br>
combustion mode switching module 48 and may provide information regarding a<br>
CO2 concentration in intake manifold 22, as discussed below. Combustion mode<br><br>
switching module 48 may be in communication air and fuel control modules 50,<br>
52 and EGR module 54, and may provide information regarding the desired<br>
combustion mode for operation of engine 12, as discussed below. Air and fuel<br>
control modules 50, 52 may control the mass air flow and fuel injection into<br>
engine 12 based on the operating combustion mode of engine 12. EGR module<br>
54 may control an amount of exhaust gas flow provided to intake manifold 22<br>
based on the operating combustion mode of engine 12.<br>
[0022] Figure 3 depicts a control logic 100 for switching from a<br>
conventional diesel combustion mode to a PCI combustion mode. Control logic<br>
100 may begin at determination block 102 where an engine load is determined<br>
by load determination module 44. The engine load may generally be based on<br>
an engine speed and an amount of fuel injected into engine 12. Once the engine<br>
load is determined, control logic 100 may proceed to decision block 104.<br>
Decision block 104 evaluates whether the determined engine load is below a<br>
predetermined limit using combustion mode switching module 48. If the<br>
determined engine load is less than the predetermined limit, control logic 100<br>
proceeds to determination block 106. However, if the load is not below the<br>
predetermined limit, engine 12 may not switch to PCI combustion mode, and<br>
control logic 100 returns to determination block 102.<br>
[0023] Determination block 106 determines the CO2 concentration in<br>
intake manifold 22 using CO2 concentration determination module 46. CO2<br>
concentration may be determined in a variety of ways including using a CO2<br>
sensor and calculating a CO2 concentration level. A calculated CO2<br><br>
concentration may be based on a CO2 concentration in the air entering intake<br>
manifold 22, a CO2 concentration in the engine exhaust gas, an EGR<br>
percentage, and a fuel quantity supplied to fuel system 18. The EGR percentage<br>
may be controlled by EGR module 54 and may be based on the operating<br>
combustion mode of engine 12. For example, operation of engine 12 in PCI<br>
combustion mode may include a higher EGR percentage than operation in the<br>
conventional combustion mode. EGR percentage may generally be defined as<br>
the percentage of the total mass flow into engine 12 that EGR accounts for.<br>
When operating in PCI combustion mode, EGR percentage may be up to<br>
seventy percent. Once the CO2 concentration is determined, control logic 100<br>
proceeds to decision block 108.<br>
[0024] Decision block 108 evaluates whether the CO2 concentration is<br>
greater than a predetermined limit using combustion mode switching module 48.<br>
If the CO2 concentration is greater than the predetermined limit, control logic 100<br>
proceeds to control block 110. However, if the CO2 concentration is not above<br>
the predetermined limit, control returns to determination block 102. Control block<br>
110 switches engine 12 from conventional diesel combustion mode to a PCI<br>
combustion mode using combustion mode switching module 48. Control logic<br>
100 may then terminate and proceed to control logic 200, as discussed below.<br>
[0025] Figure 4 depicts a control logic 200 for switching from a PCI<br>
combustion mode to a conventional combustion mode. Control logic 200 may<br>
begin at determination block 202 where an engine load is determined by load<br>
determination module 44. Control logic 200 may then proceed to decision block<br><br><br>
204 where the determined engine load is evaluated using combustion mode<br>
switching module 48. If the determined engine load is less than a predetermined<br>
limit, control logic 200 may proceed to determination block 206. However, if the<br>
determined engine load is not below the predetermined limit, control logic 200<br>
may proceed to control block 210, as discussed below.<br>
[0026] Determination block 206 may determine the CO2 concentration<br>
in intake manifold 22 using CO2 concentration determination module 46, as<br>
discussed above. Control logic 200 may then proceed to decision block 208.<br>
Decision block 208 determines whether the CO2 concentration is greater than a<br>
predetermined limit using combustion mode switching module 48. If the CO2<br>
concentration is greater than the predetermined limit, control logic 200 returns to<br>
determination block 202. However, if the CO2 concentration is not greater than<br>
the predetermined limit, control logic 200 proceeds to control block 210. Control<br>
block 210 switches from PCI combustion mode to conventional combustion mode<br>
using combustion mode switching module 48. Control logic 200 may then<br>
terminate and proceed to control logic 100, as discussed above.<br>
