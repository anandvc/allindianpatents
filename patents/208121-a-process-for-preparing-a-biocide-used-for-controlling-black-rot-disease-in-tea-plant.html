				<td>The present invention relates to process for preparing a blooide which is used for controlling the black rot disease in tea plant particularly in tea leaves.<br>
Tea plants are generally affected with various types of diseases. It has been a serious problem both within India and other tea growing countries to control the most common disease associated with tea. In the prior art, black rot disease of tea was treated with the help of conventional fungicides and not biocides. The applicant for the first time has found that a biocide can effectively control the black rot disease of tea. Moreover, the concept of bioproduct in controlling the black rot disease of tea has no precedent.<br>
The use of conventional fungicide which includes copper fungicides naaely Bavistem, Fytolan etc. has some inherent drawbacks. The fungicide if sprayed with a lower concentration, the causative organise of the disease develops resistance against the fungicide. Further it is harmful to the user also.<br>
In case of the bioeide which inc lades four aiorobial strains also soaetiees is difficult to establish in the field.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Moreover, the toxic metabolltes production by microorganisms vary from time to time according to the abiotic factors which includes aablent temperature, the moisture content and the intensity of the light* Further it is found that the development of the alcroorganlsas in the field is rather slow as compared to its requirement in controlling the black rot disease of tea*<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to mitigate the aforesaid drawbacks of the conventional processes of establishment of microorganisms in the field.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to establish a biocide which effectively controls th" black rot disease of tea.<br>
A stlII further object of the present invention is to reduce the load of chemical pesticide in the environment.<br>
A further object of the present Invention is to produce a biocide which can effectively control or prevent spreading of the black rot disease of tea which ie economical.<br>
A still farther object of the present Invention is to control the black rot disease of tea with a biocide which Is not harmful for the human beings and no adverse effect on the person<br>
handling it.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
With the above objects in view, it has been the endeavour of the applicant to produce a biocide which will satisfy all the above requirements and objectives.<br>
The applicant has utilised four strains of microbes in  producing<br>
the bIOCIdes which effectively controls or prevents the disease in tea leaves.<br>
This invention provides preparing a new biocide which comprises the following steps:<br>
(i)   transferring Baci1lus suht i1 is (BB 15) to  mother culture medium containing trypton, yeast extract and dextrose f<br>
(ii)	allowing  the mother culture to grow fro 3  to  7<br>
days;<br>
(III)	transferr i ng  the grown mother  culture  to  main<br>
culture medium	essentially containing molasses and yeast;<br>
(iv)   a1 lowing the main culture to grow for another 3 to 7 days to obtain (BB 15) cultures<br>
(v)   transferring Pseudomonas -putida (BP 20) to mother culture medium.<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
vi)    allowing it to. grow for 3 to 7 day*;<br>
vti)    transferring the grown mother culture to main culture medium<br>
viii)     allowing it to grow for 3 to 7 days to produce the ready culture;<br>
ix)     transferring  Trichoderma viride  (FT1) to mother culture medium;<br>
x)    allowing it to grow for 15 days;<br>
xi)    transferring the grown mother culture to main culture medium;<br>
xii)    allowing the main culture to grow for another 1S days to prepare the ready culture.<br>
xiii)    transferring  Trichoderma   harzianum (FT12) to mother culture Medium.<br>
xiv)    allowing it to grow for 15 days;<br>
xv)     transferring  the grown mother culture  to  main culture medium.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
xvi)   allowing it to grow tor another 15 days to  obtain the ready cultures and<br>
xvii)     mixing  the said ready stranis 1 ,2,3 and 4  in  a ratio of 4:3:2:1 to obtain the desired bxocide.<br>
In the above process of preparing the biocide, mother culture medium is subjected to agitation in a rotary shakar at 100 rpm while the main culture is preferably contained by passing sterile air through the main culture medium. To produce the FT11 and FT 12 cultures, mother culture is maintained essentially in yeast extract and glucose medium. Boil ing of main culture medium water for 15-20 minutes will help to produce better quality product.<br>
In  the aforesaid process the stock culture grows in  the  mother<br>
culture  and  also  in the mam culture medium  preferably  at  a<br>
o temperature between 25-35 C and atmospheric pressure.<br>
The applicant has found that the biocide of the present inventionis very effective against Corticium invisum and C. theae which is the causative agent of black rot disease in tea. Although the medium has been selected for molasses and yeast? other suitable medium may also be employed for the culture in the preparation of biocide of the present invention.<br>
6 -<br><br>
The applicant has found that the bioproduct can be applied foliar spray using knapsack spray at a rate of 4 litres per 2 litres of water ie  about 2% in strength between 1 and 3% of biocide in water  is also effective in control ling or preventing  the  black<br>
rot disease of tea leaves.<br>
In the present invention -<br>
Mother culture medium:<br>
Microbial strains are cultivated in artificial culture medium either non-synthetic or synthetic in nature- The present invention process contains both synthetic as wel1 as non-synthetic medium comprising inorganic and organic ingredients.<br>
Mother culture medium can be defined as the culture medium in which a large "inoculum" is prepared aseptically under laboratory conditions using an autoclave for pre sterilization. The memdium comprises various inorganic/organic compounds depending an the microbial strain to be cultured/cultivated" it can also be termed as "inoculum".<br>
Main culture mediums<br>
Main culture medium is the commercial medium prepared under semisterile condition which is used for larga scale aproduction of the desired microorganisms for product preparation. The medium comprises commercial grade yeast cake and molasses at definite proportion depending on the microbial cultures to be produced in large scale. Therefore" this can also be termed as "mass culture medium"-<br>
-7-<br><br>
Experiments conducted in Tea Gardens where mature tea bushes were severally attack by black rot disease found to be very effective in controlling the same and bush recovery was tremendous.<br>
1)	A block of tea bushes each were considered one unit and five<br>
units were taken against each dilution.<br>
2)	Mix  consortium of Baci1lus subti1 is,  Pseudomonas  putida,<br>
Tnchoderma  viride  and  Trichoderma  harzianum  cultures   were<br>
diluted to 0.5 %., 1.10 %, 2.0% and 3.0 % suspensions.<br>
3)	Three  consecutive  sprays using a back  pak  sprayer  with<br>
berbicide nozzle was performed at an interval of 10 days.<br>
4)	Observations and data collection was made in alternate  days<br>
to fmdout the efficacy of the biocide.<br>
5)	Observations revealed that recovery of effected bushes  from<br>
the second round took palce in dilution 1-0 %. to 3.0 %<br>
New fresh shoots stated emerging from the plucking point giving a fresh loot- to the black rot effected bushes. But in 0.5 7. dilution sprayed bushes recovery was quite slow and not encouraging.<br>
