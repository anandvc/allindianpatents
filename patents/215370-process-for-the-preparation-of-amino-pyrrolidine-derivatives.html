				<td>The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the manufacture of racemic and optically active 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives and with the use of this process for the production of cephalosporin derivatives.<br>
3-Amino-pyrrolidine derivatives, especially optically active 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives, are important intermediates for the production of agrochemicals and of pharmaceutically active substances such as, for example, of vinylpyrrolidinone-cephalosporin derivatives.<br>
3-Amino-pyrrolidine derivatives can be manufactured in a manner known per se, for example as described in EP-A-0 218 249 starting from 1,2,4-trisubstituted butane derivatives such as e.g. tribromobutane or trihydroxybutane. The racemic derivatives can then, if desired, can be converted by a racemate resolution into optically active 3-aminD-pyrrolidine derivatives, JP 09124595-A. A process for the manufacture of optically active 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives based on the conversion of 4-hydroxy-proline as described, for example, in J, Med. Chem. 1764(92), 35, gives optically active 3-aminopyrrolidine over 3 steps.<br>
The known methods for the manufacture of 3-aminopyrrolidine derivatives as described, for example, in UK Patent No. 1 392 194, EP-A-0 391 169 and US Patent No. 4 916 141, are time consuming and lead to expensive intermediates. The interest in other processes for the manufacture of 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives, especially of optically active 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives, is therefore extremely high. Thus, Tomori et al. (Heterocycles, 1997,1, 213-225) have synthesised (S)-3-(t-butoxycarbonylamino)-pyrrolidine from (S)-3-benzyloxycarbonylamino-l,4-dimethanesulfonyloxybutane by cyclization with excess allylamine and deallylation of the resulting (S)-l-allyl-3-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)pyrrolidine with palladium on charcoal. However, on a technical scale allylamine is unpractical, being a poisonous, inflammable and explosive liquid; also, palladium is an expensive catalyst. It was now found that 3-amino-pyrroliÂ¬dine derivatives, especially optically active 3-amino-pyrroUdine derivatives, can be safely manufactured in high yield on a technical scale by replacing allylamine with hydroxyl-amine or its acid addition salt, particularly the hydrochloride, which is cheap and much easier to handle, having none of the said disadvantages, being a solid, which is easily<br><br>
soluble in polar organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, triethylamine or mixtures thereof. The hydroxy group of the resulting N-hydroxy-3-protected-amino-pyrrolidine is then removed by catalytic reduction with Raney nickel, which is a cheap catalyst.<br>
In accordance with these findings, the invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivatives of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R" signifies hydrogen or an amino protecting group;<br>
Z signifies hydrogen or an amino protecting group;<br>
and<br>
*	represents a center of chirality,<br>
which process comprises converting a compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
X signifies a protected hydroxy group;<br>
Z" signifies an amino protecting group; and<br>
*	has the above meaning,<br>
in the presence of hydroxykmine or an acid addition salt thereof into the N-hydroxy-pyrrolidine derivative of the general formula<br><br>
wherein Z1 and * have the above meanings, the N-hydroxy group of which is subsequently reduced to the secondary amine of the general formula<br><br><br>
wherein Z1 and * have the above meanings, by hydrogenation with Raney nickel; and, if desired, protecting the secondary N1 amino group by reaction with a compound of the formula R10X1, in which R10 is an amino protecting group and X1 is halogen or a leaving group, to yield a compound of the general formula<br><br>
in which R10, Z1 and * have the above meanings, and, if desired, deprotecting the secondary 3-amino group by catalytic hydrogenation to yield a compound of the general formula<br><br>
in which R10 and * have the above meanings.<br>
Under the above definitions the term "protected hydroxy group" in the scope of the present invention encompasses ester groups, for example, sulfonates such as mesylate, tosylate, p-bromobenzenesulphonate or p-nitrobenzenesulphonate. These are especially groups which are cleaved off selectively under the reaction conditions for the ring closure such that the amino protecting group Z in the 2-position is not liberated. Mesylate and tosylate (mesyloxy and tosyloxy) are especially preferred protected hydroxy groups X.<br>
The term "amino protecting group" in the scope of the present invention encompasses lower alkyl, benzyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkenyl-oxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and the like. t-Butoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl, particularly the latter, are especially preferred.<br>
The term "leaving group" embraces halogen atoms, such as chlorine or bromine, and lower alkylsulfonyloxy or lower alkyphenylsulfonyloxy groups such as mesyloxy or tosyloxy, also anhydride residues of carbonic acid such as t-butoxycarbonyloxy.<br>
The term "lower alkyl" in the scope of the present invention encompasses straight-chain and branched, optionally chiral hydrocarbon groups with 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, i-propyl, i-butyl, tert-butyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like. "Lower alkoxy" has analogous significance.<br><br>
The term "lower alkenyl" encompasses olefinic, straight chain and branched groups with 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as vinyl, allyl, 3-butenyl, 1,3-butadienyl.<br>
The terms "lower allyl", "lower alkoxy" and "lower alkenyl" keep their meanings in combinations e.g. with "carbonyi", e.g. t-butoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl.<br>
In an especially preferred aspect of the process of the present invention optically active R-form of 2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-l,4-dimethanesulfonyloxybutane is cyclized with hydroxylamine hydrochloride at about 0Â°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, triethyiamine or dimethylsulfoxide or a mixture thereof, quite preferably in triethylamine. Subsequently, the hydroxy group of the resulting N-hydroxy-3-protected pyrrolidine of formula III is reductively removed by hydrogenation with Raney nidcel at room temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere. The resulting secondary amine of formula IV can subsequently be N-protected, preferably by t-butoxycarbonyl, by reaction with di-t-butyl-dicarbonate, preferably at room temperature. The benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group of the resulting di-protected product of formula V is expediently removed catalytically with hydrogen and palladium on charcoal, preferably at room temperature.<br>
The resulting primary amine of formula VI is especially suitable for manufacturing vinylpyrrolidinone-cephalosporin derivatives of the general formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
Y signifies CH or nitrogen;<br>
R1 denotes hydrogen or an amino protecting group; and<br>
* denotes a center of chirality.<br>
Compounds of formula A are cephalosporin derivatives having a high antibacterial activity, especially against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
Compounds of the general formula A can be produced as per EP-A-849 269 in accordance with Scheme I:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In Scheme 1 Y, R1 and * have the above significance; Ph is phenyl, BOC is t-butoxy-carbonyl and CHPh2 is benzhydryl.<br>
For obtaining the compounds of the general formula A the 3-amino-pyrrolidine derivative of formula I are manufactured in accordance with the invention according to the method described above, thereafter reacted in accordance with Scheme 1 with 2-bromo-4-chlorobutanoyl chloride, and the N-substituted 3-bromo-2-pyrrolidone (1) so obtained is converted into the Wittig salt (2) which is reacted with the diprotected 3-ene cephalosporin (3). The resulting condensation product (4) is oxidized to the 5-sulfoxide (5) which is reductively isomerized with PBrs to the 2-ene cephalosporin (6), the latter is N-deprotected and acyiated with the activated acyl derivative (8) to yield (9) which is deprotected in two steps to yield (10) and finally the end product of formula A.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention.<br>

Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.4 g; 20.2 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated at 60Â°C over night. The mixture was poured in aqueous HCI (the pH was adjusted to pH=6 with NaHCO3) and extracted twice with AcOEt. The organic phase was washed with water and dried over Na2SO4. The solids were filtered off and the solvent was removed. A light yellow oil (1.4 g, purity 73%) was obtained (yield: 85%). The crude title compound was used as is.<br>

The crude (R)-3-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-N-hydroxy-pyrrolidine obtained above (1.4 g) was dissolved in ethanol (10 ml). Raney nickel (about 2 g) was added to this mixture. The reaction was degassed under reduced pressure and hydrogen supply (three times) and subsequently put under hydrogen atmosphere (1 bar). The reaction was over after 6 hours, yielding crude (R)-3-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-pyrrolidine which was further processed in situ, in that di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.0 g, 4.58 mmol) was added; the mixture was stirred for one hour. The solvent was removed and the residue taken up in an n-hexane/AcOEt mixture (1:1,20 ml) and filtered through a silicagel pad. The silica was washed with n-hexane/AcOEt mixture (1:1; 250 ml). The organic phases were<br><br>
evaporated. The compound was obtained as a colorless oil (1.125 g; yield 81%) in good purity, i.e. at least 90 - 95 %, rendering the compound sufficiently pure for further reaction, e.g. in Example 3.<br><br>
