				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for the removal of full cops arranged on a spinning frame.<br>
In known ring spinning frames (see for instance WO 90/03461, DE 41 13 092 Al, EP 0 445 374 Al, DE 295 07 054 U) it is common that the full cops being arranged on the transport device are removed after a replacement of the tubes only after the spinning process has been started again. This being based on the fact that sufficient time is available for the removal of the full cops during the spinning process, while on the other hand, after a cops - tube exchange, the spinning process is to be restarted as quickly as possible, thereby avoiding possible operating time loss.<br>
After replacing the full cops onto the transport device it is possible that at the spinning units where a thread break has already occurred before the cops exchange, the lose thread, which remains on the cops, is being caught at the membrane of the preferably pneumatically operating gripper. During the procedure of gripping and conveying the empty tube, the thread is clamped and when depositing the tube onto the spindle the thread clings to the tube because of the static charges and when starting rotation of the spindle the thread is wound onto the tube during the cops forming process.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a method and a device of the above stated type by which even in case of the existence of a thread break on one or several cops, the lose thread remaining on the cops does not interfere with the following spinning process.<br>
Said task is solved by way of the characteristic features according to-the claims 1 and 5.<br><br>
The idea of the invention is to be seen in the fact that contrary to the prevailing opinion, that the removal of full cops could take place without time pressure, the transport device is set into motion immediately in order to remove the full cops as quickly as possible from the zone of the pertaining spinning units so that possible lose threads on single or on several cops can be drawn away from the zone of the pertaining empty tubes and thus cannot be wound onto them.<br>
Preferred further features of the method and preferred further embodiments of the device according to the invention are disclosed.<br>
The invention is particularly advantageous in spinning frames with peg tray conveying devices such as is disclosed for instance in the patent applications WO 90/03461 or DE 41 13 092 Al.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the removal of full cops arranged on a spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, with a plurality of spinning units, with at least one doffer beam provided with grippers for each spinning unit to replace full cops against empty tubes on the spindles, whereby the cops and the empty tubes can be moved back and forth along the longitudinal direction of the machine frame away from the spinning units, to the spinning units respectively, by means of a transport device, said device being provided with pegs for the cops, the empty tube respectively, during which process the doffer beam replaces empty tubes from main peg of the transport device onto auxiliary pegs moves upwards and draws full cops off the spindles, moves downwards and replaces the cops onto the main peg of the transport  device draws off the empty<br><br>
tubes from the auxiliary pegs, moves upwards and replaces them onto the spindles whereafter the process of spinning is continued and the cops are being removed from the transport device, characterized in that the full cops are removed out of the zone pertaining to a specific spinning unit by the transport device before the spinning process is continued.<br><br>
In the following the object of the invention is described by way of the only figure of the drawing showing a schematical view of three spinning units of a ring spinning frame according to the invention.<br>
According to the drawing of a not shown machine frame, there are for instance 200 spinning units 11 arranged evenly spaced next to each other each of which is provided with a roving bobbin 20, followed by a drawing unit 21 which is followed by spindles 19 and a doffer beam 12 being movable in the direction of the double arrow F, i.e. upwards and downwards, and which is swivable towards the front and the back. The doffer beam 12 is provided with pneumatic grippers 15 which consist of ring hoses surrounding an opening 26 which hoses can be inflated with pressurised air and thus can clamp empty tubes 14, cops 13 respectively at their ends, entering the openings 26 in such a way that said tubes and cops can be transported by said doffer beam 12, which is movable upward and downward and which is<br><br>
swivable respectively, from a transport device 18 arranged in the lower part of the machine frame to the spindles 19 and vice versa.<br>
The transport device 18 consists of a conveyor belt 22 being movable along the spinning units 11 in horizontal direction of a double arrow f, which belt carries pushers 23 and upward pointing auxiliary pegs 17 being spaced at same distances as the spinning units 11. The pushers 23 are engaged with peg trays 25 which can glide in a space determined by the pushers 23, in correspondence with the spaces between the spinning units 11, along a stationary path 24 extending longitudinally and parallel below the conveyor belt 22. Each peg tray 25 carries a main peg 16 pointing in upward direction.<br>
According to the drawing the main pegs 16 on the peg trays 25 carry full cops 13, while the auxiliary pegs 17 protruding from the upper side of the conveyor belt 22 carry empty tubes 14.<br>
The ring spinning frame is provided with a schematically indicated time controller unit 27 which controls the movements of the doffer beam 12 together with the grippers 15, the transport device 18 and the operation of the spinning frame.<br>
The procedure of operation of the described ring spinning frame is as follows:<br>
During a spinning process the roving is led from the roving bobbins 20 via the drawing unit 21 to the spindles 19 which initially carry empty tubes 14 and which are successively being filled by winding the yarn being produced until they become full cops 13.<br>
At a separate facility the spinning frame peg trays 25 are provided with empty tubes 14 during the spinning process, which by way of the transport device 18 are being brought to the respective pertaining spinning units 11.<br><br>
As soon as the tubes on the spindles 19 have become full cops 13, the doffer beam 12, by respective movement, at first grips the empty tubes 14 being on the main pegs 16 and replaces them onto the auxiliary pegs 17. Thereafter the doffer beam 12 moves upwards and grips the cops 13 being on the spindles 19 in order to transport them downwards and to replace them onto the main peg 16. By means of the time controller 27 the conveyor belt 22 is brought into such a position to the doffer beam 12 with its grippers 15, whereby said doffer beam is fixedly arranged in longitudinal direction of the machine frame, that it either is put in alignment with the main peg 16 or the auxiliary peg 17.<br>
After the full cops 13 have been put onto the peg tray 25, the doffer beam 12, after the respective alignment with the auxiliary pegs 17, grips the empty tubes 14 thereon, moves the tubes upwards and replaces them onto the spindles 19.<br>
According to the invention the transport device 18 is now set into motion by means of the time controller 27 before the spinning process is newly started.<br>
The time controller 27 initiates the next spinning process only after the full cops 13 have been moved so far from the pertaining spinning unit 11 that possible lose threads at the cops in any case are brought as far away from the spinning unit 11, that they can not anymore cling to the respective empty tubes 14 which are put onto the pertaining spindle 19 thereafter, thereby effectively avoiding that such lose threads are being wound onto the next empty tube during the following spinning process.<br><br>
The time controller of the spinning frame assures that the spinning process is started 20 sec to 25 sec after the transport device (18) has been started in order to remove the full cops (13) and as soon as the cops (13) of each spinning unit (11) has been moved to at least the next spinning unit (11) by 0.7m to 1.5m away from the respective spinning unit (11).<br><br><br>
