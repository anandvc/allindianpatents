	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
	any opening in the body from which a body fluid is excreted or discharged, such as a<br>
	bandage or nursing pad or any external treatment given through the skin, like pain<br>
	relievers.<br>
		There is thus provided in accordance with ont embodiment of the present<br>
5	invention, a protective garment. In one embodiment, the protective garment is a<br>
	protective undergarment. In another embodiment, the protective garment is a protective<br>
	dressing. The protective garment may be used in a variety of applications including<br>
	clothing applications or medical applications. The protective garment may include two<br>
	portions: (1) a garment body (which may be integrally farmed and which may be<br>
10	composed of a liquid impermeable materia); and (2) an absorptive device or material<br>
	(such as a pad) associated with me garment body.<br>
		Preferably, the garment body may include a first portion which is formed with<br>
	multiple perforations to permit passage of perspiration therethrough, and a second portion<br>
	which may be substantially not perforated, so as to prevent passage of body secretions<br>
15	and medical dressings therethrough.<br>
		In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the absorptive<br>
	device or material is associated with the garment body at the second portion.<br>
		In one embodiment, the second portion extends beyond the absorptive device or<br>
	material. In alternate embodiment, the absorptive material or pad may extend beyond the<br>
20	second portion of the garment body.<br>
		There is additionally provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
	present invention a protective garment comprising an integrally formed garment body<br>
	formed of a liquid impermeable material, the garment body including a first portion<br>
	which is formed with multiple perforations to permit passage of perspiration<br>
2<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
	therethrough, and a second portion which is substantially not perforated, so as to prevent<br>
	passage of body secretions and medical dressings therethrough.<br>
		Preferably, the liquid impermeable material is a natural elastomer like latex.<br>
		Alternatively, the liquid impermeable material is artificial elastomer like silicons<br>
5	rubber or polyturethane.<br>
		In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the garment body<br>
	may have a thickness of less than 300 microns.<br>
		Preferably, the protective garment also comprises an absorbent device or material<br>
	associated to the undergarment body.<br>
10		The protective garment may be a brassiere, underpants, medical dressing or any<br>
	other suitable garment or medical device.<br>
		The protective garment may have fibers affixed to at least part of one surface of<br>
	the garment body.<br>
		In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the absorbent device<br>
15	or material includes a portion extending downward from the crotch along the thigh.<br>
		There is additionally provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
	present invention a method of manufacture of protective garments comprising the steps of<br>
	forming a garment body of a liquid impermeable material, and forming multiple;<br>
	perforations on a first portion of the garment body to permit passage of perspiration<br>
20	therethrough.<br>
		Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
	the method includes the step of affixing fibers to at least one surface of the undergarment<br>
	body. For example, cotton fibers may be affixed to at least one surface of the<br>
	undergarment body.<br>
3<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
		In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the protective garment may include<br>
	two portions: (1) a garment body and a connector (which may be integrally formed and<br>
	which may be composed of a liquid impermeable material); and (2) tubing. The garment<br>
	body may be worn on any portion of the body. One example of the portion of the body<br>
5	may include a portion of the face. Another example of the portion of the body may<br>
	include a portion of the arm.<br>
		The connector may be integral with the garment body. Or, alternatively, the<br>
	connector may be separate from, but attached to, the garment body. The connector<br>
	connects the tubing to the protective garment. Tubing may be used to absorb or drain<br>
10	liquid from or transmit liquid to the body. The garment body may be composed of a<br>
	liquid impermaable material such as natural and artificial elastomers. Non-limiting<br>
	examples of synthetic elastomers include polyisobutylene, isobutyleae-isoprene<br>
	copolymer (butyl elastomer), polyvinyl acetate, polyisoprene, polyethylene, vinyl acetate<br>
	-vinyl laurate copolymers having vinyl laurate contents of about 5% to about 50% by<br>
15	weight of the copolymer, neoprene (polychloroprene), thermoplastic elastomers, nitrile<br>
	rubber, synthetic latex (which has no proteins), styrenic elastomers, polyurethane, and<br>
	silicone rubber, and combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of natural elastomers<br>
	include natural rubber such as smoked or liquid latex and guayule, and combinations<br>
	thereo. Further, the garment body may include a portion, which is formed with multiple<br>
20	perforations to permit passage of perspiration therethrough.<br>
		The connector may be composed of a shape-retaining material, such as metal,<br>
	plastic, a composite (e.g. of metal and plastic), or any other suitable material. Non-<br>
	limitmg examples of plastic include polyurethane, polyacrylamide, and polyvinyl chloride<br>
	(PVC), The connector may have associated with it a material (for example, an absorbent<br>
4<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
	material). The connector may fit with the tubing via a variety of ways, such as by a press<br>
	fit, by threading on the connector, the tubing or both the connector and the tubing.<br>
		A protective garment of the invention can also comprise colors (e.g. pigments or<br>
	dyes) and/or fragrances (e,g. perfumes) in the liquid impermeable material end/or fibers.<br>
5	A color or fragnance can be added, for example, to an elastomeric emulsion before<br>
	immersing a mold (which will give the protective garment its shape) into the emulsion.<br>
	Furthermore, a protective garment of the invention can comprise embossed designs or<br>
	patterns. The designs or patterns can be created by engraving a design in the garment<br>
	mold. For example, if the protective garment is to be used by children, a teddy bear<br>
10	design can be created in the mold, thereby giving the garment a more attractive<br>
	appearance to the user. Furthermore, the design can be created with different thicknesses<br>
	within the same garment (e.g., by further dipping of the desired areas in the liquid latex<br>
	(either pre-or post-vulcanized) or a synthetic elastomer precursor solution, or by applying<br>
	coagulants on the mold before dipping, on the desired area to get a thicker result.)<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
		Reference is now made to Fig, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, lF, 1G, 1H sad II are<br>
	simplified illustrations of a method for producing protective undergarments in accordance<br>
10	with a preferred embodiment of the preseat invention, The invention is described<br>
	hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 1A - II, with specific reference to uoderpants, it<br>
	being appreciated that the invention applies equally to any other suitable garment<br>
	(undergarment, garment worn over some other garment, or garment worn in conjunction<br>
	with no other garment).<br>
15		As seen in Fig. 1 A, a three dimensional garment form 10 is provided on which an<br>
	array 12 of protrusions 14, such as needles, is formed in the general shape of underpants<br>
	to be formed. The protrusions 14 are preferably covered with TEFLON®. The crotch area<br>
	16of the underpants is preferably not formed with protrusions 14. The remained of the<br>
	from 10 is preferably coated with a non-adhersion substance, such as TEFLON®-<br>
20	Otherwise perforations can be made by mechanical means (e.g., roller press).<br>
		As shown in Fig. 1B, garment from 10 is preferably dipped in a liquid 17, such as<br>
	latex or silicone, which when allowed to dry, forms a stretchable, high weight garment 18<br>
	over array 12 and crotch area 16. It may be apprenciated that the provision of protrusions<br>
	14 causes the garment 18 to be perforated except at crotch area 16. Thus the garment 18<br>
25	is 'breathable" except at the crotch area 16, where it is liquid impermeable.<br>
6<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
		Following dipping of garment from 10 into liquid 17, the garment 18 may be<br>
	rubbed with a mechanical device (not shown) in order to remove any superfluous<br>
	elastomer material.<br>
		In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated<br>
5	in Fig. 1C, and absorptive pad 20 is associated with the light weight garment 18 at the<br>
	crotch area 16, However, the absorptive pad 20 can be extended beyond the crotch area if<br>
	desired. It may be associated by the use of an adhesive or attached to the reminder of<br>
	garment 18 by virtue of the faet that the latex is allowed to dry on the form 10 in<br>
	engagement with the absorptive pad 20.<br>
10		Prior to removal of the garment 18 from the form 10, the exterior surface of the<br>
	garment on the form 10, which will eventually be turned inside-out to form the interior<br>
	surface, is preferably sprayed with adhesive 22, as shown in Fig. ID and thereafter with<br>
	cotton fibers 24 or any other suitable material as indicated in Fig. IE, thereby to provide a<br>
	comfortable and non-stick skin engaging surface. Preferably pad 20 is covered during the<br>
15	steps of Figs. 1D and 1E with a cover 26, which extends somewhat beyond the pad, so as<br>
	to prevent liquid migration form the pad to the cotton fibers.<br>
		The resulting garment 30 may then be removed from the form 10, as seen in Fig.<br>
	1F and turned inside out. The outer surface of garment 30 may be coated or otherwise<br>
	covered with cotton fiber or any other suitable material and finished in an appropriate<br>
20	manner.<br>
		The completed garment 40, as seen in Fig. 1G, is preferably extremely light<br>
	weight, low cost, stretchable, underpants, which is perforated generally except at the<br>
	specific areas mostly covered with the absorbent material and which is preferably<br>
	integrally formed with an internal absorptive pad. The garment is preferably formed of<br>
25	an elastic material, such as latex or silicone, and has a thickness of less the 300 microns.<br>
7<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
	In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as seen in Fig. 1H, a<br>
	tear region 42 may be incorporated in the garment, such as at a side thereof. This enables<br>
	ease of removal of the garment, by tearing it at region 42. Once removed the torn, worn<br>
	garment may be disposed of as illustrated in Fig. 11.<br>
5		The final stage of manufacturing of the garment 18 may include a vulcanization<br>
	process and edge-cutting of the garment, as known in the art.<br>
		As can be seen from Fig. 2, the garment may be underpants 50, a brassiere 60, or<br>
	any other suitable garment. It is noted that the pad 62 of the underpants 50 may have a<br>
	portion which extead downwardly along the wearer's legs.<br>
10		Referring to Fig. 3A, there is shown a medical protection garment 70. The<br>
	medical protection garment may include a garment body 72. A portion of the garment<br>
	body (or the entire garment body) may be composed of an elastic material or a liquid<br>
	impermeable material. Examples of materials may include latex or silicone. The garment<br>
	body 72 may include straps 74 or other types of adjustment devices (such as snaps, clips,<br>
15	fasteners, or the like) in order to adjust the garment body so that it fits strongly or<br>
	comfortably with the wearer. Some or all of the garment body may be perforated. A<br>
	portion of the garment body (not shown in the figure) may be covered with material (such<br>
	as cotton fibers), thereby to provide a comfortable and non-stick skin engaging surface.<br>
	The medical protection garment 70 shown in Fig. 3A may be used to protect, bandage and<br>
20	treat a portion of the body, such as single breast, after a medical procedure (such, as a<br>
	breast surgery). The absorptive device of material associated with the garment body may<br>
	include medical ointments, medicine for treatments or diagnostic materials. Referring to<br>
	Figure 3B, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the garment 76 showing a<br>
	simplified illustration of a sanitary brassiere (for nursing when a woman is breast feeding)<br>
25	or medical brassiere (to be used after breast surgery) garments.<br>

	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
		Referring to Figure 4, there is shown a simplified illustration of another medical<br>
	protective garment 80. The medical protective garment 80 may include a garment body<br>
	82. A portion of the garment body (or the entire garment body) may be composed of an<br>
	elastic material or a liquid impermeable material. Examples of materials may include<br>
5	latex or silicons. The garment body 82 may include straps 84 or other types of<br>
	adjustment devices (such as snaps, cups, fastener, or the like) in order to adjust the<br>
	garmsm body so that it fits snugly or comfortably with the wearer. Some or all of the<br>
	garment body may be perforated. A portion of the garment body (not shown in the<br>
	figure) may be covered with material such as cotton fibers, thereby to provide a<br>
10	comfortable and non-stick skin engaging surface. As shown in Fig. 4, an absorptive<br>
	material 86 is attached to garment body 82 while another portion of material 86 may not<br>
	be attached to garment body 82. The material 86 may be connected at various portions to<br>
	the garment body. For example, the material 86 maybe attached at two of its ends, one to<br>
	the upper portion of the garment body 82 and the other to the lower portion of the<br>
15	garment body 82. In this manner, a pocket may be formed. The medical protective<br>
	garment 80 shown in Fig. 4 may be used on a limb, such as a foot, and may help in the<br>
	treatment of those who suffer from diabetes.<br>
		Referring to Fig, 5, there is shown a simplified illustration of a medical protective<br>
	garment 90 with a garment body 92, a connector 94 and tubing 96, The garment body 92<br>
20	and the connector 94 may be integrally formed. Altemativelyi the garment body 92 and<br>
	the connector 94 may be composed of separate pieces and may be attached to one another<br>
	(such as by glue, fasteners or the like). The garment body may be composed of an elastic<br>
	or liquid impermeable material. Similarly, the connector may be composed of an elastic<br>
	or liquid impermeable material. The garment body 92 may be worn on any portion of the<br>
25	body. One example of the portion of the body may include on a portion of the face, as<br>
9<br><br>
	WO 2004/047694							PCT/IB 2003/006472<br>
	shown in Fig. 5. Another example of the portion of the body may include a portion of the<br>
	and, such as when a user requires intravenous liquid.<br>
		The garment body 92 may include a portion which is formed with multiple<br>
	perforations to permit passage of perspiration therethrough. Further, the garment body 92<br>
5	may include straps (not shown) or other types of adjustment devices (such. as snaps, clips,<br>
	fasteners, or the like) in order to adjust the garment body 92 so that it fits sungly or<br>
	comfortably with the wearer. In the example shown in Fig. 5, the adjustment device may<br>
	adjust to fit the head of the user.<br>
		The connector 94 connects the tubing 96 to the protective gannent 90. Tubing 96<br>
10	may be used to absorb liquid from or transmit liquid to the body. For example, as shown<br>
	in Fig. 5, the tubing may be used for drainage from the body. Alternatively, tubing may<br>
	be used to supply fluid or liquid to the body.<br>
		The connector may have associated with it a material (for example, an absorbent<br>
	material). In this manner, the tubing 96 may be to the connector 94 with less<br>
15	discomfort to the user. The connector may fit with the tubing via a varity of ways, such<br>
	as by treading 98. The threading may be on the tubing 96, on the connector 94 or on<br>
	both the connector 94 and file tubing 96. Alternatively, the tubing 96 may be fit by a<br>
	press fitting the tubing 96 with the connector 94.<br>
		It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art of that the present invention is<br>
20	not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather the<br>
	scope of the present invention includes variations and modification of the various features<br>
	described in the specification and shown in the drawings which may occur to a person of<br>
