				<td>Process and device for carrying out reactions in a reactor<br>
with slot-shaped reaction spaces<br>
COMPLETE DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for carrying out<br>
reactions between at least two fluid reactants using a<br>
reactor in which there are located wall elements, slot-<br>
shaped reaction spaces and cavities for conducting a fluid<br>
heat-carrier through.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
By virtue of DE 33 42 74 9 A1 a plate-type reactor for<br>
chemical syntheses under high pressure is known wherein the<br>
plates take the form of flat right parallelepipeds which<br>
are bounded by sheet-metal walls and which each form a<br>
chamber filled with a catalyst, the two largest walls of<br>
which are gas-impermeable. Flow of the reaction gases<br>
through the granular catalyst takes place either<br>
horizontally or vertically through two open or pierced<br>
narrow sides of the right parallelepiped which are located<br>
opposite each other. With a view to heating or cooling<br>
(depending on the reaction, either exothermic or<br>
endothermic), cooling channels are provided in the chambers<br>
for the circulation of a liquid heat-carrier. These<br>
cooling channels may be formed by sheet-metal structures<br>
which take the form of crosspieces, corrugated sheet metal<br>
or such like and which are firmly connected to the smooth<br>
walls, for example by welding. The totality of the<br>
chambers is adapted in outline to the shape of a<br>
cylindrical reactor, so that the chambers have, in part,<br>
varying sizes and are perfused in succession by the<br>
reaction gases, e.g. also in groups. The structural design<br>
is enormously elaborate, and the production output, which<br>
as such is already low, can at best be increased by axial<br>
lengthening and/or by a parallel connection of several<br>
reactors.<br><br>
By virtue of EP 0 691 701 A1 a stacked reforming generator<br>
is known wherein, with a view to carrying out endothermic<br>
reactions, a reforming chambers with heat-recovery medium<br>
connected downstream is embedded in each instance between<br>
two combustion chambers. In this case the directions of<br>
flow of the gases in the reforming chambers and in the<br>
combustion chambers are opposite, semipermeable walls being<br>
arranged ahead of the heat-recovery chambers which are<br>
connected downstream in each instance. The heat-recovery<br>
medium consists, in exemplary manner, of spheres of<br>
aluminium oxide. With a view to improving the exchange of<br>
heat, between the individual chambers there are arranged<br>
horizontal heat-conducting sheets which are provided with<br>
openings for the passage of fuel in the heating region.<br>
Between each such group of three there is located, in turn,<br>
a fuel-distributing chamber. The device is extraordinarily<br>
complicated in structure and is neither provided non<br>
suitable for exothermic processes since the device<br>
possesses no cooling channels, as this would run counter to<br>
the sense and purpose of the known solution. The<br>
structural design, which is not suitable for operation at<br>
high pressure, serves the purpose of shortening the overall<br>
length by virtue of the omission of special heating zones.<br>
By virtue of DE 44 44 364 C2 a vertical fixed-bed reactor<br>
with rectangular casing cross-section is known for<br>
exothermic reactions between gases, wherein the fixed bed<br>
consisting of catalysts is subdivided by vertical<br>
partitions for the purpose of forming separate flow<br>
channels and a plate-type heat-exchanger. Below and above<br>
the flow channels, catalyst-free interspaces are located in<br>
each instance in alternating arrangement. The gases emerge<br>
at the upper end of the fixed bed from some of the flow<br>
channels and are conducted again through lateral overflow<br>
channels beneath the fixed bed, from where they are<br>
supplied through the respective other flow channels to a<br>
gas outlet nozzle. The device is neither provided nor<br><br>
suitable for endothermic processes, since the device<br>
possesses no means for a supply of heat. In addition, on<br>
account of the rectangular cross-section of the casing the<br>
structural design is not suitable for operation at high<br>
pressure.<br>
By virtue of EP 0 754 4 92 A2 a plate-type reactor for<br>
reactions of fluid media is known which is constructed in<br>
the form of a static mixer with exchange of heat. For this<br>
purpose, numerous plates are stacked on top of one another,<br>
the lowest of which is closed in the outward direction and<br>
the uppermost of which merely possesses bores in the<br>
outward direction for the intake and discharge of the media<br>
to be caused to react or that have been caused to react, and<br>
of a heat-carrier medium. The respective second plates<br>
from below and from above possess, in addition, recesses<br>
which are open on one side for the redirection of the<br>
reactants through the stack in a meandering shape. In the<br>
plates situated in between there are located X-shaped or<br>
cloverleaf-shaped mixing chambers and reaction chambers<br>
which are connected to one another in the direction of the<br>
stack. The heat-exchanger channel is also guided through<br>
the stack of plates in a meandering shape. The plates<br>
consist of material with good thermal conductivity,<br>
preferably metals and alloys, have a thickness between 0.25<br>
and 25 mm and can be produced by micromachining, etching,<br>
stamping, lithographic processes etc. They are firmly and<br>
tightly connected to one another on their surfaces outside<br>
the apertures, i.e. on the periphery, for example by<br>
clamping, bolts, rivets, soldering, adhesive bonding etc,<br>
and thereby form a laminate. The complicated flow paths<br>
give rise to high resistances to fluid flow and are not<br>
capable of being filled with catalysts. On account of the<br>
requisite machining, the production process is extremely<br>
elaborate, because all the contact surfaces have to be<br>
finely ground.<br><br>
By virtue of DE 197 54 185 C1 a reactor for the catalytic<br>
conversion of fluid reaction media is known wherein a fixed<br>
bed consisting of catalyst material which is supported on a<br>
sieve plate is subdivided by vertical thermal sheets which<br>
each consist of two metal sheets which have been deformed<br>
repeatedly in the shape of a cushion and which are welded<br>
to one another, including a space for conducting a cooling<br>
or heating medium through at points which are distributed<br>
in the form of a grid. The reaction media and a heat-<br>
carrier medium are conducted in counterflow through the<br>
columns of the fixed bed between the thermal sheets, on the<br>
one hand, and the cavities in the thermal sheets, on the<br>
other hand. The container of the reactor is constructed in<br>
the form of a vertical cylinder, and the thermal sheets are<br>
adapted to the cylinder, that is to say they have varying<br>
sizes. Also in this case the production output, can at best<br>
be increased by axial lengthening and/or by a parallel<br>
connection of several reactors.<br>
By virtue of DE 198 16 2 96 A1 from the same applicant it is<br>
known to generate an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide<br>
from water, hydrogen and oxygen in a reactor which may<br>
contain both a fixed-bed packing consisting of particulate<br>
catalysts and planar monolithic carriers which are provided<br>
with channels, take the form of heat-exchangers and are<br>
provided with coatings of catalyst material. By way of<br>
catalysts, elements from the 8th and/or 1st subgroups of<br>
the Periodic Table are specified, such as Ru, Rh, Pd, Tr,<br>
Pt and Au, whereby Pd and Pt are particularly preferred.<br>
Activated carbon, water-insoluble oxides, mixed oxides,<br>
sulfates, phosphates and silicates of alkaline-earth<br>
metals, Al, Si, Sn and of metals pertaining to the 3rd to<br>
6th subgroups are specified by way of carrier materials.<br>
Oxides of silicon, of aluminium, of tin, of titanium, of<br>
zirconium, of niobium and of tantalum as well as barium<br>
sulfate are specified as being preferred. Metallic or<br>
ceramic walls having the function of heat-exchangers<br><br>
analogous to plate-type heat-exchangers are named as<br>
materials for monolithic carriers. The specified<br>
experimental reactor had an inside diameter of 18 mm with a<br>
length of 4 00 mm. The temperatures were within the range<br>
from 0 to 90 Â°C, preferably 20 to 70 Â°C, the pressures were<br>
between atmospheric pressure and about 10 MPa, preferably<br>
between about 0.5 and 5 MPa. Also with respect to this<br>
state of the art, the production output can at best be<br>
increased by axial lengthening and/or by a parallel<br>
connection of several reactors.<br>
A reactor as to DE 195 44 985 C1 as well as DE 197 53 720<br>
A1 comprises a plate-like heat exchanges wherein the fluid<br>
head-carrier is conducted through the slot formed between<br>
two plates. There is no hint on the function of width slot-<br>
shaped reaction spaces.<br>
A device as to DE 197 41 645 Al comprises a microreactor<br>
with reactions and cooling channels wherein the depth a of<br>
the reaction channels is 
thickness b between reaction and cooling channels is 
Âµm. This document gives no indication to use reaction<br>
spaces other than said channels. A microreactor comprising<br>
many parallel grooves as reaction spaces is thought by DE<br>
197 48 481. The manufacture of a reactor for large scale<br>
throughput is expensive.<br>
Furthermore, so-called microreactors are known in which the<br>
dimensions of the flow channels are in the region of a few<br>
hundred micrometres (as a rule, 
high transport values (heat-transfer and mass-transfer<br>
parameters). The fine channels act as flame barriers, so<br>
that no explosions are able to spread. In the case of<br>
toxic reactants, a small storage volume (hold-up volume)<br>
leads, in addition, to inherently safe reactors. But a<br>
filling of the channels with catalysts is impossible by<br>
reason of the small dimensions. A further crucial<br>
disadvantage is the elaborate production process. In order<br><br>
to avoid clogging of the fine channels, over and above this<br>
an appropriate protection of the filter has to be provided<br>
for upstream of the reactor. High production outputs can<br>
only be obtained by means of parallel connections of many<br>
such reactors. Furthermore, the reactors can only be<br>
operated at higher pressures when the cooling medium is at<br>
the same pressure level.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object underlying the invention is to specify a process<br>
and a device with which it is possible to carry out,<br>
optionally, exothermic and endothermic processes whereby<br>
several fluid reactants react with react other in the<br>
presence or absence of catalysts and whereby the reaction<br>
region of the reactor is constructed in a modular design,<br>
so that it is possible to adapt the production output to<br>
the requirements.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the object as formulated<br>
is achieved, in the case of the process specified at the<br>
outset, in that<br>
a) the slot-shaped reaction spaces are formed between<br>
lateral surfaces of, in each instance, two substantially<br>
equally large and substantially right-parallelepiped<br>
wall elements made from solid plates and in that the<br>
wall elements are arranged interchangeably in a block<br>
within a virtual right parallelepiped,<br>
b)	the reactants are introduced into the slot-shaped<br>
reaction spaces from edge regions situated on the same<br>
side of the block and are conducted through the reaction<br>
spaces as reaction mixture in like directions in<br>
parallel flows, and in that<br>
c)	the fluid heat-carrier is conducted through the<br>
cavities extending in the interior of the wail elements.<br>

DETAILD DESCRIPTION<br><br>
By virtue of the invention the object as formulated is<br>
achieved in full measure; in particular, it is possible to<br>
carry out, optionally, exothermic and endothermic processes<br>
whereby several fluid reactants (gases and/or liquids)<br>
react with each other in the presence or absence catalysts<br>
and whereby the reaction region of the reactor is<br>
constructed in a modular design, so that it is possible to<br>
adapt the production output to the requirements. By<br>
reducing width of the reaction spaces from e.g. 5 mm to<br>
0,05 mm the ratio of the surface to the volume of the<br>
reaction spaces is increasing. As a result, problems<br>
araising from the limited heat transfer within gases are<br>
decreased, so that highly exothermic or endothermic<br>
reactions can safely be performed.<br>
However, still further advantages arise:<br>
  combination of microreaction technology with the<br>
advantages of simple manufacture according to classical<br>
workshop techniques,<br>
  easy interchange of indivi dual wall elements (the term<br>
"substantially equally large and substantially right-<br>
parallelepiped" means that minor deviations, caused by<br>
continetive reasons, are tolerable) ,<br>
  virtually arbitrary thickness of the wali. elements<br>
without impairment of function,<br>
  enlargement of the specific surface area by<br>
profiling/roughening,<br>
  direct total or partial coating of the lateral surfaces<br>
with varying catalyst material by impregnating,<br>
spraying, printing or such like with varying thickness,<br>
  filling of the reaction spaces with catalyst particles<br>
of varying size,<br><br>
  possibilities of gas/gas reactions, gas/liquid<br>
reactions, liquid/liquid reactions,<br>
  impression of flow patterns and flow channels, e.g. for<br>
drainage and for allowing liquid reaction products to<br>
flow off, simple separation,<br>
  possibility of altering the slot widths,<br>
  mixing of the reactants only in the reaction spaces,<br>
good reaction control,<br>
  avoidance of backflows out of the reaction spaces,<br>
  good controllability by reason of high heat-transfer<br>
coefficients and large surfaces, i.e. rapid response to<br>
changes in loading and/or in the desired temperature<br>
values and uniform temperature profile and thereby<br>
longer service lives of the catalyst by avoidance of<br>
"hot spots",<br>
  inherent safety in the course of causing otherwise<br>
explosive reaction mixtures to react,<br>
  small dead volume ("hold-up volume"),<br>
  possibility of working under high pressure, slight<br>
losses of pressure in the reaction spaces,<br>
  immersibility in liquid solvents and operability with a<br>
sump which can be temperature-controlled (heated/cooled)<br>
from outside and which enables a gentle termination of<br>
the reaction by "quenching" and/or washing,<br>
  possible addition of inhibitors in order to prevent<br>
secondary reactions, reducibility of the volume of the<br>
gas/liquid by means of filling materials and/or<br>
displacers in the pressure vessel on the other side of<br>
the product outlet in the sump,<br><br>
  reduction in the number of connections and easier<br>
sealability as regards leakages (important in the case<br>
of toxic components),<br>
  low resistances to diffusion, high space-time yields, in<br>
particular higher throughputs than in the case of the<br>
known microreactors, simpler "scale-up" from the<br>
laboratory scale to the production scale by<br>
multiplication ("number-up"),<br>
  simple and compact structural design, reduction of<br>
investment costs and operating costs (maintenance,<br>
consumption of energy),<br>
  possibility of the construction of small plants.<br>
In this connection it is particularly advantageous, within<br>
the scope of further configurations of the process<br>
according to the invention, if - either individually or in<br>
combination:<br>
  at least one reactant is supplied through the wall<br>
elements and is introduced into the reaction space in<br>
question through at least one of the lateral surfaces of<br>
the wall elements,<br>
  a distributing medium, from which the reaction spaces<br>
are provided with the reactants, is arranged on at least<br>
one side of the block,<br>
  by way of distributing medium, use is made of a solid<br>
body with groups of channels, the cross-sections of<br>
which are chosen to be so small that no spreading of<br>
flames is possible in them in the course of the supply<br>
of reactants that form an explosive mixture,<br>
  by way of distributing medium, use is made of a packing<br>
material with a grain size and with interspaces that are<br><br>
chosen to be so small that no spreading of flames is<br>
possible in them in the course of the supply of<br>
reactants that form an explosive mixture,<br>
  the slot width of the reaction spaces is preferably<br>
chosen between 0.05 and 5 mm and more preferred 0,05 to<br>
0,2 mm,<br>
  in case of explosive reactions mixtures the slot width<br>
os chosen so small that no spreading of flames is<br>
possible,<br>
  the reaction spaces are filled with granular catalyst,<br>
  the lateral surfaces of the wall elements facing towards<br>
the reaction spaces are covered at least in places with<br>
catalyst material,<br>
  the lateral surfaces of the wall elements facing towards<br>
the reaction spaces are provided with a profiled<br>
structure for the purpose of enlarging the surface area,<br>
  the wall elements are immersed at least partially in an<br>
aqueous or organic solvent or solvent mixture,<br>
  by way of solvent, use is made of water, optionally with<br>
at least an addition of inhibitors that prevent a<br>
decomposition and/or degradation of the reaction<br>
product, and/or, if<br>
  the process is used for the purpose of producing<br>
hydrogen peroxide from water (vapour), hydrogen and air,<br>
optionally enriched with oxygen, or oxygen.<br>
The invention also relates to a device for carrying out<br>
reactions between at least two fluid reactants using a<br>
reactor in which there are located wall elements, slot-<br>
shaped reaction spaces and cavities for the purpose of<br>
conducting a fluid heat-carrier through.<br><br>
With a view to achieving the same object, such a device Ls<br>
characterised, according to the invention, in that<br>
a)	the slot-shaped reaction spaces are arranged between<br>
lateral surfaces of, in each instance, two substantially<br>
equally large and substantially right-parallelepipedal wall<br>
elements made from solid plates and in that the wall<br>
elements are arranged interchangeably in a block within a<br>
virtual right parallelepiped,<br>
b)	the supply of the reactants into the slot-shaped<br>
reaction spaces is capable of being carried out from the<br>
same side of the block, the reaction mixture being capable<br>
of being guided through the reaction spaces in like<br>
directions and in parallel flows and in that<br>
c)	the wall elements each tubular cavities for conducting<br>
the fluid heat-carrier through the wall element.<br>
The process and the device are suitable, in exemplary<br>
manner, for the following processes:<br>
  selective hydrogenations and oxidations,<br>
  production of propenal by catalytic oxidation of propene<br>
with an O2-containing gas having elevated oxygen<br>
concentration in comparison with air, accompanied by an<br>
increase in selectivity, for example in the presence of<br>
a Mo-containing catalyst at a temperature within the<br>
range from 350 to 500 Â°C and at a pressure wi thin the<br>
range from 0.1 to 5 MPa,<br>
production of acrylic acid by catalytic oxidation of<br>
  propene, for example in the presence of a Mo-containing<br>
catalyst and a promoter at 250 to 350 Â°C and at 0.1 to<br>
0.5 MPa ,<br>
  production of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide from<br>
ethylene or propylene, respectively, and gaseous<br>
hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an oxidic or<br>
siliceous catalyst, such as titanium silicalite, at a<br><br>
temperature within the range from 60 to 200 Â°C and at. a<br>
pressure within the range from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa,<br>
  direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 or<br>
an O2-containing gas in the presence of a noble-metal<br>
catalyst and water or water vapour - for example<br>
according to the process disclosed in DE-A 198 16 296<br>
and according to those processes disclosed in further<br>
documents cited therein. By way of catalysts in this<br>
connection, use may be made of elements from the 8th<br>
and/or 1st subgroups of the Periodic Table, such as Ru,<br>
Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt and Au, whereby Pd and PL are<br>
particularly preferred. The catalysts may be employed<br>
per se, e.g. as suspension catalysts, or in the form of<br>
supported catalysts by way of packing in the slot-shaped<br>
reaction spaces, or they are fixed to the wall elements,<br>
directly or through the agency of layer-forming<br>
supporting materials. By way of supporting materials,<br>
use may be made of activated carbon, water-insoluble<br>
oxides, mixed oxides, sulfates, phosphates and silicates<br>
of alkaline-earth metals, Al, Si, Sn and of metals<br>

Exemplary embodiments of the subject-matter of the<br>
invention will be elucidated Ln greater detail below on the<br>
basis of Figures 1 to 10.<br>
In Figure 1 there are shown - in exploded representation -<br>
two wall elements 1 with lateral surfaces 2 which include<br>
between themselves a reaction space 3 through which the<br>
reactants flow in the direction of the arrow 4. In each of<br>
the wall elements there are arranged cavities 5 in the form<br>
of through bores which extend parallel to the lateral<br>
surfaces 2 and terminate in the narrow sides 6 of the wall<br>
elements 1. Alternative solutions are specified further<br>
below.<br>
The wall elements 1 take the form of flat right<br>
parallelepipeds, the largest surfaces of which are the<br>
lateral surfaces 2. These lateral surfaces 2 may - as<br>
shown - be provided with a profiled structure, that is to<br>
say they may be roughened, for example, in order to enlarge<br>
the effective surface area. The lateral surfaces 2 may<br>
furthermore be wholly or partially provided with surface<br>
deposits consisting of a catalyst material, but this is not<br>
represented separately here. Further particulars are<br>
evident from Figure 4. It is also possible, alternatively<br>
or in addition, to arrange particulate catalysts in the<br>
reaction space 3, the size of which is adapted to the slot<br>
width "s" (Figure 4).<br>
Figure 2 shows the combination of thirteen such equally<br>
large wall elements 1 so as to form a right-<br><br>
parallelepipedal block 24; however, this number is<br>
variable, wherein one of the essential purposes of the<br>
invention lies, namely the possibility of adaptation to<br>
varying production outputs and processes. The mass<br>
transport in unidirectional parallel flows - here from<br>
above in a downward direction - is only hinted at by means<br>
of arrows.<br>
Figure 3 shows a vertical section through a series<br>
arrangement according to Figure 2 above the bottom 7 of a<br>
pressure-resistant reactor, the lower flanged joint 8 of<br>
which is shown here. The supply of liquid solvents is<br>
effected via the pipe 9, the removal of residual gases is<br>
effected via the pipe 10, the removal of the end product is<br>
effected via the pipe 11, and the removal of sump material<br>
is effected via the pipe 12, optionally with a view to<br>
cleaning.<br>
Figure 4 shows the detail from circle A in Figure 3 on an<br>
enlarged scale and supplemented in perspective view, i.e.<br>
the circumstances on both sides of a reaction space 3. The<br>
slot width "s" of the reaction space 3 is maintained at a<br>
predetermined measurement by spacers 13 and is chosen, in<br>
exemplary manner, between 0.05 and 5 mm. However, this<br>
range may also be fallen below or exceeded. In case of<br>
highly exothermic and endothermic reactions, esspecially<br>
comprising an explosive gas mixture, the slot width is<br>
reduced until any flame spreading is avoided. The optimal<br>
lot width depends on the medium and reaction type and i s<br>
determined by experiments. As can be seen from Figures 4<br>
and 6 the slot width "s" of the inventive device is<br>
significantly smaller than the thickness of the wall<br>
elements. In the tubular wall elements there are located<br>
the cavities 5, which have already been described, for<br>
conducting a fluid heat-carrier through. Depending on the<br>
temperature control thereof, heat can be dissipated in the<br>
case of an exothermic process or heat can be supplied in<br><br>
the case of an endothermic process. By way of heat-<br>
carrier, use may be made of water, oils, gases and<br>
optionally also the product itself.<br>
In the wall elements 1 there are located furthermore<br>
semicylindrical recesses 14 which complement one another so<br>
as to form a substantially cylindrical feed channel 15 for<br>
a first reactant. Located furthermore in the wall elements<br>
are further feed channels 16 for at least one further<br>
reactant. The feed channels 16 are connected to the<br>
respective reaction space 3 by means of discharge openings<br>
17, whereby the discharge openings 17 lead into the Lateral<br>
surfaces 2 of the wall elements so that the reactants are<br>
able to mix in the reaction spaces 3. The cavities 5, the<br>
feed channels 15 and 16 and also the row(s) of discharge<br>
openings 17 are parallel to one another and to the lateral<br>
surfaces 2 of the wall elements 1 and extend over the<br>
entire length thereof - viewed in the horizontal direction.<br>
The cooling channels (= tubular cavities (5)) may, Ln a<br>
manner analogous to the formation of the feed channels (15)<br>
according to Figure 4, also be configured, in such a way<br>
that each wall element (1) is split parallel to the lateral<br>
surfaces (2) into two subelements and semicylindrical or<br>
otherwise shaped recesses are arranged in the slot<br>
surfaces. As a result of pressing the respective two<br>
corresponding subelements together, cavities (5) are<br>
formed, through which a fluid heat-carrier is able to flow.<br>
The term "tubular" comprises round or square-formed<br>
channels or pipes.<br>
The slot width "s" is so chosen that no flames are able to<br>
spread in the reaction spaces 3 in the case of explosive<br>
reaction mixtures. In special cases, the local formation<br>
of explosions in the reaction spaces may also be permitted,<br>
in which case care has only to be taken structurally to<br>
ensure that these explosions do not flash over to adjacent<br>
reaction spaces.<br><br>
Important in this connection is the fact that the feed<br>
channels 15 and 16 extend in the (upper) edge region of the<br>
wall elements 1 or of the reaction spaces 3, so that<br>
virtually the entire (vertical) length of the reaction<br>
spaces 3 is available for the reaction. Further<br>
particulars of and alternatives to the supply and removal<br>
of reactants and heat-carrier will be elucidated in still<br>
more detail on the basis of the following Figures.<br>
Figure 5 shows a partially sectioned side view through the<br>
subject of Figure 3 after rotation about a vertical axis by<br>
an angle of 90 degrees. Two reactants are supplied to the<br>
system through the feed pipes 18 and 19: in the case of the<br>
production of hydrogen peroxide, air via feed pipe 18 and<br>
hydrogen via feed pipe 19. The transport of the fluid<br>
heat-carrier through the cavities 5 will also be elucidated<br>
in greater detail on the basis of Figure 5: the narrow<br>
sides 6 of the wall elements 1 are closed by mounted plates<br>
20 in which there are arranged U-shaped channels 21 for the<br>
connection of, in each instance, two cavities 5. However,<br>
this is only represented on the left-hand, side of the<br>
block. The heat-carrier is supplied through a feed pipe 22<br>
and is removed through a drain 23.<br>
For the wall elements, use may be made of sufficiently heat<br>
conductive, preferable metallic, substantially right-<br>
parallelepipedal plates. The wall elements 1, which are<br>
preferably made out of metal (e.g. stainless steel), may<br>
consist of solid plates with appropriate bores (cavities 5<br>
and feed channels 16) and recesses 14. Alternatively, the<br>
cavities 5 may be combined, optionally also in groups, in<br>
which case conducting devices, e.g. ribs, for guidance of<br>
the heat-carriers are arranged within the cavities which<br>
are then larger. The wall elements 1 may also be composed<br>
of two plate-like subelements which are connected to one<br>
another in sealed manner, for example screwed together.<br>
The only important point is that they withstand the, in<br><br>
some cases, considerable pressure differences (up to 10 MPa<br>
or 100 bar) between the heat-carrier and the reactants.<br>
Figure 6 shows the subject of Figure 2, schematically and<br>
complemented in thick lines by an (upper) distributing<br>
space 48 with a central feed pipe 49 for educt(s) and a<br>
(lower) collecting space 50 with a drain 51 for the<br>
product. One of the reactants or a mixture of the<br>
reactants R1 and R2 can be supplied via the distributing<br>
space 48. In the case of a mixture, the feed pipes 15 and<br>
16 (in Figure 4) can be dispensed with if the spacers 13<br>
are interrupted. In the case of explosive reaction<br>
mixtures, in addition to the procedure according to the<br>
arrangement in Figure 2 a procedure according to the<br>
arrangements in Figures 8 to 10 can also be adopted.<br>
The open narrow sides 6 of the wall elements 1 can be<br>
covered by a plate combination, consisting of a plate 41<br>
and a distributing body 47, which is designed to be<br>
uninterrupted over the width and height of all the wail<br>
elements 1 and which is represented - on a greatly enLarged<br>
scale - in Figure 7. Figure 7 shows a vertical section<br>
through the upper edge region of such a plate combination<br>
41/47 with a flow channel 45 for one of the reactants and<br>
with flow channels 4 6 for the heat-carrier. For the intake<br>
and/or discharge thereof, openings 42 and 43 which are<br>
connected to the flow channels 45 and 4 6 in the<br>
distributing body 47 are arranged in the plate 41.<br>
The flow channels 45 and 46, which extend perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the drawing, are formed, for example, by<br>
grooves in the distributing body 47. The grooves may be<br>
produced by metal-cutting, by casting or forging. This<br>
results in great stability of form which withstands the<br>
pressure differences that are demanded. This plate<br>
combination 41/47 - with its openings 42 and 43 in<br>
alignment with the associated channels in the wall elements<br>
1 - is now screwed in sealing manner by means of a gasket<br><br>
54 onto all the narrow sides 6 of the wall elements 1 of<br>
the block 24. Only a few of the numerous screw joints 52<br>
are represented. By this means, a provision of the wall<br>
elements 1 is effected corresponding to the arrows 53 in<br>
Figure 6. By means of dashed lines 55 it is indicated that<br>
several flow channels 4 6 may also be combined to form a<br>
common flow channel or distributing space.<br>
The plate combination 41/47 may also be redesigned to the<br>
effect that it is suitable for a provision of wall elements<br>
1 according to Figure 4.<br>
Now Figure 8 shows, on the basis of a partial vertical<br>
section, a schematic representation of a complete reactor,<br>
e.g. for the production of hydrogen peroxide. A right-<br>
parallelepipedal block 24 consisting of several wail<br>
elements 1 according to Figures 1 and 2 is suspended from<br>
above in a pressure vessel 2 5 which is filled with a<br>
solvent 27, for example water, to a level 26. The slot-<br>
shaped reaction spaces 3 extend parallel to the plane of<br>
the drawing.<br>
At the top the pressure vessel. 25 possesses a Lid 2.8 which<br>
is subdivided by a partition 29 into two chambers 30 and<br>
31, the partition 29 being mounted in sealing manner onto a<br>
distributing medium 37 which consists of a solid body<br>
(preferably made of metal) with two separate groups of<br>
narrow channels 39 and 40. The channels 39 extend in the<br>
solid body from the chamber 30 to the upper ends of the<br>
reaction spaces 3, the channels 40 extend from the chamber<br>
31 to the upper ends of the reaction spaces 3. In those<br>
channels 39 and 40 the reactants are accordingly unable to<br>
mix, but, even if this were to happen, no flames are able<br>
to spread in the channels 39 and 40. Mixing of the<br>
reactants takes place only in the reaction spaces 3, in<br>
which likewise no flames are able to spread if it is a<br>
guestion of a reaction mixture that is explosive as such.<br>
The explosive properties of the reaction mixture are<br><br>
material-dependent and reaction-dependent and have to be<br>
determined in the given case.<br>
Through a connecting socket 34 a first reactant "R1" is<br>
supplied to chamber 30, and through a further connecting<br>
socket 35 a second reactant "R2" is supplied to chamber 31.<br>
The waste gases that are not needed are conducted away<br>
according to arrow 32, the product is withdrawn according<br>
to arrow 33, and the sump can be emptied through the pipe<br>
12. Figure 8 shows, in addition, another connecting socket<br>
36 for a third reactant "R3" and/or a solvent such as<br>
water. The plates 41 which are applied at both ends are<br>
only indicated very schematically.<br>
Figure 9 shows a bottom view of the lid 2 8 of the pressure<br>
vessel 25 according to Figure 8. Bores 28a serve for screw<br>
coupling.<br>
Figure 10 differs from Figure 8 in that, by way of<br>
distributing medium 38, there is arranged above the block<br>
24 of wall elements 1 a packing material which consists of<br>
heat-conducting particles, for example sand, grit, metal<br>
shavings, metallic fibres or such like, which rest on a<br>
sieve plate which is not shown. In this distributing<br>
medium 38 the reactants R1 and R2 already mix in accordance<br>
with random distribution before they enter the reaction<br>
spaces 3. However, the distributing medium forms such<br>
narrow interspaces that, likewise, no spreading of flames<br>
with explosive consequences is able to occur in them.<br>
The spatial location of the wall elements 1 is practically<br>
arbitrary: in accordance with the Figures, they may be<br>
arranged in a horizontal series arrangement, but they may<br>
also be arranged in a vertical, stack. The direction of the<br>
parallel flows can also be adapted to practical needs: as<br>
shown, the parallel flows can be guided vertically from the<br>
top downwards, but they may also be guided the other way<br>
round, from the bottom upwards. The parallel flows may<br><br>
also run horizontally. As a result, the block 2 4 with the<br>
plates 41 and the connections can be "rotated" into various<br>
spatial locations.<br><br>
