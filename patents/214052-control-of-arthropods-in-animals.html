COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"CONTROL OF ARTHROPODS IN ANIMALS"<br>
AVENTIS CROPSCIENCE S.A., a French body corporate of 55 Avenue Rene Cassin, F-69006 Lyon,   France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
Control of Arthropods in Animals<br>
The present invention relates to a method of control of parasites in animals, compositions comprising a compound effective for the said control and new compounds effective against parasites.<br>
It is generally a goal of agronomists and veterinarians to possess sufficient means to control pests, particularly arthropods, when they attempt to invade or attack mammals, particularly domestic animals and/' or livestock. A classical method of controlling such pests has been the use of topical and/or systemic pesticides on or in the domestic animal which is being attacked. Generally effective treatments include the oral administration of insect growth regulators, such as lufenuron, or antihelminth compounds such as an ivermectin or an avermectin, or the topical application of the insecticide fipronil. It is advantageous to apply pesticides to animals in oral form so as to prevent the possible contamination of humans or the surrounding environment.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new pesticides which may be used in domestic animals.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide safer pesticides for domestic animals.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pesticides for domestic animals that may be used in lower doses than existing pesticides.<br>
These objects are met in whole or in part by the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a method of controlling parasites in or on an animal comprising admini ferine orally to the animal a parasiticidally effective, substantially non-emetic amount of a 1-arylpyrazole of formula (I):<br><br>

WO 00/35884	PCT/EP99/10452<br>
immediately prior to treatment, then allowed access to the remainder of the daily ration immediately following treatment.<br>
All dogs were infested with cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) and with ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) 1 day prior to administration of the compound. Cats were only infested with fleas. The initial flea and tick counts were performed 1 day after the administration of the compounds. At 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after treatment the dogs were re-infested with ticks and 8, 15, 22 and 29 days after treatment the dogs and cats were re-infested with fleas. At 1, 9, ) 6, 23 and 30 days after treatment the control of fleas and ticks in treated dogs and cats was determined versus a group of infested dogs and cats which received a placebo consisting of a 1:1 volume/volume solution of dimethyl sulfoxide and corn oil. To determine the efficacies of the compounds, the arthropods were combed from the animals and counted.<br>
In the animals treated with the compounds above, there was substantially no emesis after 2, 8 and 24 hours. Generally long-term control of fleas and ticks was provided in dogs. In the cats treated, there was commercially acceptable control of fleas for at least one day post treatment.<br>

Reference Example 1<br>
A solution of 5-amino-3-cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4-trifluoromethylthiopyrazole (500 g) in methyl orthoformate was treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid (10 ml) and heated at 50oC After 8 hours the reaction mixture was evaporated to give a solid which was washed (heptane) and air-dried to give 3-cyano-1 -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluorornethylphenyl)-5-ethoxymeihylideneamino-4-trifluorornethylthiopyrazole (217 g), m.p. 68Â°C.<br>

Synthesis Example 3<br>
3-Cyano-1 -(2,6-dichIoro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-  mctH&gt;i^i)iiiu-4-uintioromethyisuifrnyipyra2oie (111.55 g, 0.247 moles), triethylamine (62.45 g, 0.618 moles), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (3 g, 0.0247 moles), and tetrahydrofuran (700 ml) was combined. The resulting solution was heated to 45Â°C and ethoxyacetyl chloride (45.2 g,<br><br>
WO 00/35884	PCT/EP99/10452<br>
0.37 mmol) was added dropwise over 10 min. After 1 h. the mixture was evaporated to a brown residue, which was dissolved in 500 ml of ethyl acetate and washed with 2 x 300 ml of water. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to a brown oil. The oil was triturated with 1 L of hot cyclohexane. The resulting solids were collected by filtration and washed with 500 ml of hoi cyclohexane, then air dried to afford of compound 3-3 as a beige powder (116.7 g). Evaporation of the mother liquors afforded a second crop of compound 3-3 (8.4 g).<br>

Reference Example 2:<br>
Step A: Preparation of 3-Cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5~ethoxymethylideneamino-4-trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole.<br>
A 12-L inrec-neeked  nask. titled with an uverhcau simcr, heating mantle, water separaior (e.g. Dean Stark trap) with condenser was placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 1.475 kg (3.37 moles) of fipronil and 6 L of triethyl orthoformate. The suspension was<br><br>
WO 00/35884	PCT7EP99/10452<br>
heated to reflux over 2.5 h, then at reflux for 3 h with collection and removal of the distillate. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, then evaporated under reduced pressure at a bath temperature of 60-80Â°C, then at 50Â°C overnight. The resulting beige solid, 1.717 kg (95.8 % by HPLC, 3.335 moles, 99% purity corrected yield) was used without further purification, (m.p. about 63Â°C)<br>
Step B: Preparation of 3-Cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-methylamino-4-trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole.<br>
A 50 L reactor was charged with 3-Cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethyIphenyl)-5-ethoxymethylideneamino-4-trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole (1.645 g, 3.335 moles) and absolute ethanol (16 L) under nitrogen. The solution was cooled to 10Â°C, and sodium borohydride (266 g, 7.03 moles) was added slowly such that the temperature, remained generally below 35Â°C. After 6.75 h, some additional sodium borohydride (25 g, 0.66 moles) was added and stirring was continued overnight. Acetic acid (1.3 L, 22.7 moles) was added to quench, followed by 16 L of water. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water, and air-dried. Recrystallization from methanol afforded 3-Cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-rnethylamino-4-<br>
trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole (350 g) as an off-white solid, (m.p. about 227OC<br><br>
