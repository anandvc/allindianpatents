TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a system and method for an intervertebral implant, in detail a trial implant for the preparation of an intervertebral space for insertion of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, to an implant for insertion into this prepared intervertebral space; to a chisel for use with an implant or a trial implant for preparation of the intervertebral space, to a pre-trial implant for radiographic and geographic orientation in the intervertebral space; to a device for keeping an intervertebral space open for discectomy and/or for the insertion of an implant, trial implant or pre-trial implant; to a mounting instrument for mounting an intervertebral disc implant having a superior and inferior implant plate and an inlay; to an inserter for inserting a trial implant or an implant into the intervertebral space; and to a method for positioning and fixing an intervertebral implant in the intervertebral space.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIORART<br>
Implants having at least one upward- or downward-projecting keel are frequently used as intervertebral implants. For receiving at least one keel of an implant in the superior or inferior vertebra, a groove is usually chiselled by means of a chisel for each keel. A pre-trial implant or a trial implant can be used in the intervertebral space in the conventional manner for radiologic or spatial orientation. In order to keep an intervertebral space open for discectomy and/or for insertion of an implant, trial implant or pre-trial implant, struts are customarily used and are mounted on the outside of the vertebra.<br>
Known implants for insertion and the method for direct oblique anterior preparation of an intervertebral space have been publicized under the name Prodisc® (brand of Spine Solutions) both for the lumbar spinal region and for the cervical spine region and have been successfully launched on the market.<br>
Under the title "Instrument and Method for preparing an intervertebral space for receiving an artificial disc implant", patent applications related to the tools or instruments and the method for the preparation of an intervertebral space for insertion of an artificial disc implant directly from the anterior were filed on 2003-04-03 as U.S. application serial no. 10/023,879 and subsequently as PCT/US04/12664. The intervertebral implant Prodisc® currently on the market corresponds substantially to the content of this Patent Application.<br>
Furthermore, patent applications related to the instruments required for Prodisc® and the method for insertion of the intervertebral implant were filed title "Instruments and method for inserting an intervertebral implant" on 2003-07- 02 as U.S. application serial no. 10/622,803 and subsequently as PCT/US04/22608. The Prodisc® system corresponds substantially to the content of the Patent Application.<br>
Prodisc® is described in the brochures of Spine Solutions as "Cervical Total Disc Replacement" for the cervical spinal region and as "Lumbar Total Disc 5 Replacement" for the lumbar spinal region:<br>
2<br><br>
Brochure "Prodisc-L", with the publication designation SMT 001 G -03/03 and also S MT014-04/04 describes how the form and function of an intervertebral disc can be substantially restored by insertion of an intervertebral disc o prosthesis from the anterior.<br>
The instruments required for this purpose and the surgical technique are described:<br>
•	creation of an access to the two affected vertebrae;<br>
•	removal of the intervertebral disc (discectomy) from the intervertebral 5 region;<br>
•	determination of the implant size, implant height, angle of lordosis and implant position by means of a trial implant by the exact central orientation thereof with radiographic monitoring;<br>
•	precutting of grooves simultaneously from above and below, directly from 0 the anterior direction, by means of a fork-shaped double chisel guided in the trial implant;<br>
•	insertion of the upper (superior) and lower (inferior) implant plates, the inferior and the superior plates simultaneously being mounted in the predetermined position without distraction. 5<br>
•	With the aid of an inserter, the two adjacent vertebrae are forced apart and<br>
•	by means of a pusher the PE inlay is pushed into the inferior plate and securely locked;<br>
•	the instruments are removed and the final implant position is checked by 0 means of radiographic monitoring.<br>
Brochure "Prodisc-C", with the publication designation SMT013-04/04, describes how the form and function of a cervical spine is substantially restored by insertion of a cervical intervertebral disc prosthesis:<br>
•	First, fixation of the cervical vertebra to a holder by means of screws and subsequently discectomy are carried out, and the intervertebral space is held apart by means of a spreading forceps.<br>
•	A trial implant having an adjustable stopper is inserted, and, guided by a fork-like chisel, a groove is then simultaneously chiselled directly from the anterior direction into the superior and inferior cervical vertebrae.<br>
•	The already completely assembled implant is then inserted into the cervical intervertebral space by means of a special inserter.<br>
In the brochure PRODISC® "Retrospective Clinical Study: 7 to 11 Year Follow- Up" published with<br>
the number SMT 002E-03/06, the aims, the method and the results of these implant techniques are<br>
summarized with a conclusion:<br>
All implants (61 out of 64) which were inserted within a period of 7-11 years were intact and<br>
functioned properly.<br>
There was a substantial reduction in back pain and leg pain, and 92.7% of the patients were very<br>
satisfied with the insertion of the prosthesis.<br>
Both Prodisc® products and the associated instruments have already been tested and have been very well accepted by the patient. The mobility of the spine was completely restored in many cases.<br>
Also known is PCT publication WQ-2004/080355Al "Articular disc prosthesis for anterior-oblique insertion", which describes an intervertebral disc prosthesis for anterior/lateral-oblique insertion. A product of Medtronic "Maverik" corresponds to an embodiment of this published Patent Application. "Maverik" is an intervertebral disc prosthesis which - after corresponding preparation of the intervertebral space- can be inserted from the oblique anterior/lateral direction at an angle of 30°.<br>
This PCT publication WO-2004/080355 teaches that insertion can be effected from the lateral direction. In the case of the insertion direction chosen for "Maverik", however, the fact that lateral insertion leads to a change of the footprint, i.e. to a change of the sagittally visible base surface of the implant, was overlooked. In comparison with known implants which permit oblique anterior insertion, "Maverik" is smaller and approximately triangular. This is evidently associated with its<br>
3<br><br>
insertion direction of 30°. However, a smaller footprint means in certain circumstances poorer anchorage of the prosthesis in the vertebra. On consideration of the PCT publication together with "Maverik", a person skilled in the art would, however, therefore generally be discouraged from choosing an oblique anterior/lateral access. The footprint reduction and poorer fixing associated therewith appear seriously disadvantageous to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Furthermore, publication WO-2004/080355Al, at Fig. 40 showed a figure with an angle of about 52° to the AP direction, measured from the figure. In publication WO-2004/080355Al , this angle is about 37° in Fig. 44a. The fact that Medtronic, which is associated with SDGI, actually markets and delivers its product "Maverik" with only 30° is understood by the person skilled in the art to teach departure from the originally disclosed access angle of about 52° through about 37° to 30°. To the person skilled in the art, however, this means that the implant area must be reduced in order to bypass the vessels without risk of injury (oblique access). This is the teaching of this WO publication in conjunction with the product "Maverik".<br>
Evidently, in the choice of the angle at the time of the development of Maverik, the persons skilled in the art did not regard an angle between 52° and 37° as optimal, but rather an angle of about 30° which is not even described in WO-2004/080355Al , and accepted the effect with footprint reduction. Another patent publication, EP1259175B1 , relates to "Instruments for disc space preparation". It discloses a medical instrument for the preparation of an intervertebral space between adjacent vertebrae of a patient. A cutting edge guide is designed so that it has a distraction holder for maintaining distraction between the two vertebrae. A blade channel has a guide channel which is designed so that it can receive a guide rib at or on a cutting edge in order to maintain the orientation of the cutting edge relative to the holder and hence relative to the vertebrae.<br>
U.S. published application no. 20040199168 discloses instruments and methods for the positioning of one or more implants in a spinal intervertebral space. The instruments and methods are designed for oblique insertion laterally relative to the intervertebral space. The instruments include a dish-actor, and a guide to permit positioning of one or more implants in the intervertebral space.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the invention is the provision of novel intervertebral implants, of a novel improved method and of the associated instruments or of devices for the preparation of an intervertebral space and for the insertion of an intervertebral implant, in particular for the lumbar spine.<br>
According to another object, the method of the invention is intended to permit oblique anterior/lateral insertion at an angle of about 45°, in particular left oblique-anterior insertion, viewed from the patient.<br>
A trial implant according to a version of the invention may be inserted into a prepared intervertebral space. It serves for determining the size and position of the implant to be inserted. The trial implant may be oriented radiographically by means of sighting slots according to the invention, and simultaneously serves as a guide for a chisel. A chisel may be used for chiselling, into the intervertebral surface of the superior and inferior vertebrae, a respective groove each of which is normal to the intervertebral surface so that an implant insertable in exchange for the trial implant and having a corresponding keel rests as flat as possible on the vertebral surface. The trial implant has a superior and an inferior contact surface with at least one guide slot each which guides the chisel in at least two directions in space.<br>
The keel of the implant may be fixed thereto or, according to a version which may be used independently of the above, may be mounted rotatably relative to the contact surface, with subsequent fixing in the contact surface.<br>
4<br><br>
According to a version of the invention, the chisel is in the form of a mono- chisel, and is guided in the trial implant or in the implant For the preparation of the intervertebral space, in particular for radiographic and spatial orientation in the intervertebral space, a pre-trial implant according to the invention may also be used.<br>
In order to keep the intervertebral space open for a discectomy and/ or for insertion of an implant or trial implant, leaf-like struts according to the invention are used and are inserted in the proximal area of the intervertebral space - preferably to the side of a trial implant - and run in a wedge shape at the angle of lordosis and may be curved medially at their medial end in order to improve the vision of the operating area. These novel struts may also be used independently of the above. The struts may be individual struts which can be inserted into the intervertebral space. For mounting of an intervertebral disc implant with a superior and inferior implant plate and an inlay according to the invention, a mounting instrument is used by means of which the exactly fitting implants may be assembled from a group of implant plates and inlays directly in the operating theatre. In a certain embodiment of the invention, an inserter according to the invention for the trial implant or for the implant serves for the insertion into the intervertebral space. The positioning and fixing of the intervertebral implant or of the trial implant for preparation is effected in the intervertebral space preferably at an oblique anterior, in particular left oblique anterior, angle, according to the invention at an angle of about 45° to the medial plane (anterior-posterior plane), viewed from the patient.<br>
According to a version of the invention, a special assembly device, by means of which the inlay can be placed in the correct position in the implant plate or locked with it, is used for assembly of the implant<br>
According to a version of the method of the invention, an inserter is used for inserting the trial implant or the implant, it has a retaining mechanism for an implant collet, which is passed through a rod to an actuating part having a locking lever by means of which the implant can be held or released. According to a version of the invention, the implant can be inserted all in one, or first the upper and lower part followed by the inlay. Before and during the insertion, the intervertebral space is held open by the struts according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred version, the invention starts from an optimum "footprint" with an insertion direction of about 45° giving de facto this abrupt improvement effect at 45° with the largest possible footprint in spite of anterior/lateral access.<br>
Some particular advantages resulting from the oblique insertion at about 45°:<br>
•	The main blood vessels running on the anterior side of the spine are less extended during the operation;<br>
•	this results in easier access than the direct oblique anterior access.<br>
•	It makes it possible to bypass the complex vessel structure (stomach/intestine) which is present directly in front of the vertebrae.<br>
•	Although the lateral approach is already known per se through "Maverik", the insertion angle there is 30° relative to the anterior-posterior plane. However, owing to the disadvantage of the footprint reduction of this known lateral insertion method, the inventors were discouraged from applying it further since they attached considerable importance to the footprint size or the optimum adhesion between the vertebrae and the implant.<br>
•	Through inventive considerations and experiments on the part of the inventors, it was surprisingly found that an insertion angle of about 45° during insertion of the implant proves to be optimum with regard to the best possible footprint - with a simultaneous!}' advantageous access.<br>
According to a version of the invention, particular attention is also devoted to the preparation of the intervertebral space by means of a trial implant and the exact chiselling of the groove for receiving the<br>
5<br><br>
implant keel at 90° to the respective intervertebral surface. This ensures very good retention of the implant<br>
Although the drawings also show the preferred embodiments, neither the drawings nor the description are to be interpreted as being restricted. On the other hand, contents of the drawings and of the description as well as the contents of the patent claims belong to the disclosure of the invention in this patent application. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings.<br>
For better preparation for an intervertebral disc prosthesis, a novel trial implant was developed for the preparation of the intervertebral space, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having one guide slot each in the superior and inferior bearing surface, at least one of the guide slots being formed in such a way that an insertable or inserted guide can be held or is held nondisplaceably in two directions in space- in particular parallel and normal to the respective bearing surface. A movement of a guide in the longitudinal direction relative to the guide slot is thus possible. Owing to the novel formation according to the invention, for example, the use of a monochisel instead of a forklike chisel is possible. However, this novel guide slot in the trial implant also makes it possible to locate other tools and devices relative to the trial implant.<br>
A further development of the trial implant in which the guide slot serves for guiding the chisel is characterized in that the chisel is in the form of a monochisel which is connected to a guide which is displaceable relative to it and is formed diametrically oppositely to the respective guide slot. The guide projects beyond the chisel in the longitudinal direction. The guide thus permits the positioning of the chisel relative to the trial implant and hence to the vertebra even before it touches the vertebra.<br>
According to a particular further development of the invention, the two guide slots (one each in the superior and in the inferior implant plate) are in different three-dimensional positions relative to one another (angle P). This makes it possible for the trial implant in cooperation with the chisel to enable preparation of a groove from the oblique anterior/lateral direction. It is also possible to provide a plurality of guide slots per plate.<br>
A development according to the invention which is independent of the above and of course may also preferably be used together therewith relates to a trial implant for the preparation of an intervertebral space for use of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having at least one groove each in the superior and inferior bearing surface, at least one of the grooves being in the form of a sighting slot so that, in the case of a trial implant inserted into an intervertebral space under radiographic monitoring, it enables detection of the position thereof relative to the vertebra. This ensures in a simple manner that a surgeon can perform the correct orientation of the trial implant under radiographic monitoring, and the subsequent position of the implant can thus be well prepared.<br>
This is particularly simplified if the sighting slot is at that angle (?) or at a complementary angle (d) to the respective guide slot, which corresponds to the surgical approach angle (e) or the direction of insertion of the implant into the intervertebral space for the implantation of an intervertebral disc prosthesis.<br>
In order to permit an all round positioning check by means of X-rays guided by a C-arc, a further development provides, per bearing surface, two sighting slots which are at a right angle to one another.<br>
In principle, all materials tolerated by the body are available for the choice of material, but it is advantageous if the trial implant is composed of X-ray-opaque or X-ray visible material. In the case of this design, the sighting slots are as a rule produced by milling and are open to the outside. However,<br>
6<br><br>
they can also be filled with X-ray-transparent material, for example plastic. The trial implant can thus also be plastic-coated (e.g. polyethylene), which permits an integrated surface and improved sliding properties on the insides of the vertebrae.<br>
Alternatively, the trial implant may also be composed of X-ray-transparent material, X-ray-opaque or X-ray-visible inlays being provided instead of the sighting slots. In the case of this alternative design, the X-ray visibility effect or the positioning aid is further simplified if the guide slots, too, are X-ray-visible.<br>
An invention which is independent of the above but which is preferably used together with the above constructions comprises providing, on the lateral surface, at least one impact hollow for the engagement of an impact bar in the case of a trial implant for the preparation of an intervertebral space for insertion of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, having a superior and inferior bearing 5 surface and having a lateral surface. These novel impact hollows permit secure attachment of impact bars guided by the surgeon's hand. A trial implant can thus be precisely positioned.<br>
According to a further development, a guide shank intended for engagement of o an impact shank or handle likewise serves for positioning and also for removal of a positioned trial implant according to one of the preceding designs.<br>
According to a further embodiment, an adjustable stop serves for limiting the depth of penetration of a trial implant into the intervertebral space.<br>
According to the novel insertion method according to the invention, the trial implant is preferably formed for insertion from about 45° relative to the medial plane (anterior-posterior plane) between two vertebrae.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel implant for use as an intervertebral disc prosthesis in an intervertebral space, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having at least one guide slot each in the superior and inferior bearing surface, at least one of the guide slots being formed in such a way that an insertable or inserted guide can be held or is held nondisplaceably in two 5 directions in space - in particular parallel and normal to the respective bearing surface. Such an implant makes it possible to avoid the use of a trial implant and thus to accelerate the operation process. However, its use will require even further tests so that the application is currently not yet preferred. In any case, this guide slot- as in the trial implant- may serve for guiding a 0 chisel, the chisel being in the form of a monochisel which is connected to a guide which is displaceable relative to it and is formed diametrically opposite to the respective guide slot and projects longitudinally beyond the blade of the chisel.<br>
As in the case of the trial implant, the two guide slots may be in a different three- dimensional position relative to one another (angle (b).<br>
The invention also comprises a novel implant for use as an intervertebral disc prosthesis in an intervertebral space and for the preparation of the intervertebral space, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having at least one groove each in the superior and inferior bearing surface, at least one of the grooves being in the form of a sighting slot so that, in the case of an implant inserted into an intervertebral space, said groove enables its position relative to the vertebrae to be detected radiographically.<br>
This is particularly simplified if the sighting slot is at that angle (?) or at a complementary angle (d) to the respective guide slot which corresponds to the surgical approach angle (e) or the direction of insertion of the implant into the intervertebral space for the implantation of the intervertebral disc prosthesis. In order to permit all round positioning guided in the form of an arc, two sighting slots, which are at a right angle to one another, are provided per bearing surface.<br>
7<br><br>
In principle, all materials tolerated by the body are available for the choice of material, but it is advantageous if the implant is composed at least partly of X-ray-opaque or X-ray-visible material. Instead of the sighting slots, X-ray- opaque or X-ray-visible inlays may be provided, the guide slots being X-ray visible.<br>
In a further embodiment of an implant according to the invention for use as an intervertebral disc prosthesis in an intervertebral space and for the preparation of an intervertebral space for use of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having a lateral surface, at least one impact hollow for engagement of an impact bar is provided on the lateral surface. These novel impact hollows permit secure attachment of impact bars guided by the surgeon's hand. The implant can thus be precisely positioned. The implant preferably has a removable guide shank for engagement of an impact shank or shank for the implant, which also very greatly facilitates the positioning.<br>
According to a further development, an adjustable stop serves for limiting the depth of penetration of an implant into an intervertebral space.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel implant for use as an intervertebral disc prosthesis in an intervertebral space and/or for the preparation of an intervertebral space for use of the implant, having a superior and inferior bearing surface and having at least one anchorage keel each on each bearing surface, the anchorage keel being held removably or lockably on the implant. Such an implant would make it possible to avoid the use of a trial implant and would thus accelerate the operation process. The anchorage keel should be lockable in the guide slot.<br>
This guide slot may serve for guiding a chisel and is preferably in the form of a trapezoidal guide. In addition to the guide slot, a tapped hole for a stop screw for stopping a trapezoidal foot of the keel is provided.<br>
In a further embodiment according to the invention, the anchorage keel itself is in the form of a chisel, it being possible for the chisel to have passages.<br>
The implant according to the invention is formed for insertion between two vertebrae at about 45° to the medial plane.<br>
In a further embodiment according to the invention, the anchorage keel is fixed to a rotation plate which is rotatably and lockably mounted in the bearing surface, the implant having, parallel to the bearing surface, a slot through which a clamping screw can pass, which clamping screw can be screwed tight in a tapped hole in the rotation plate.<br>
The novel trial implant with a chisel guided therein serves for the preparation of the grooves, the chisel being guided in the superior bearing surface so that, when it is subjected to an impact, a groove in the superior vertebra and in the inferior bearing surface is guided so that a groove forms in the inferior vertebra, the two grooves forming at in each case a right angle to the respective intervertebral surface.<br>
The implant according to the invention and/ or the trial implant are preferably designed in such a way that the impact shank on its proximal end has a coupling piece for force-transmitting coupling to the shank, which coupling piece has two locks which act separately from one another and have a frictional or interlocking connection and at least one of which is capable of remote release and the two couplings can each transmit at least either a torque or an axial force.<br>
According to the invention, the impact shank of the implant or of the trial implant has, at its distal end, an impact head which has impact surfaces on both sides, i.e. in the distal direction as well as in the proximal direction. The impact shank is preferably provided between its proximal and distal ends<br>
8<br><br>
with a detachable and displaceable support rod which can be fixed to the impact shank by means of a lockable clamping device.<br>
According to a further development, the implant and/or trial implant according to the invention has a detachable and adjustable stop, the adjustable stop having a captive stopper body on an adjusting screw, and the adjusting screw having a larger external diameter at its proximal end than that bore in the stopper body which it passes through, and the adjusting screw having, at its distal end, an actuator which likewise has a larger external diameter than the bore. This adjustable stop is preferably arranged directly adjacent to the shank in order to stop excess impact force from the impact shank directly at the shank.<br>
According to a further development, the adjustable stop is arranged directly adjacent to the shank and has a bore by means of which it can be guided at least approximately without play on the shank.<br>
On its proximal stop side, the adjustable stop may have a groove-like recess, and this recess is supported with its lateral surfaces in the impacted state at least approximately without play on the bearing surfaces so that it is guided in the normal direction to the bearing surfaces by the implant or trial implant<br>
A further invention, in particular for use with an implant or a trial implant for the preparation of an intervertebral space for use of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, is a chisel, having a chisel blade and a chisel shank, having an impact head at its distal end, the chisel shank being connected to a displaceable guide which can be inserted in particular into at least one of the guide slots. This chisel has a guide according to the invention, the guide being spring-loaded relative to the chisel shank so that, in the unloaded state, it is pushed towards and beyond the proximal end of the chisel blade. In a particular development, the guide is connected to a piston which is displaceable in the interior of the chisel shank under spring load and has a stop for mounting on a lateral surface.<br>
According to the invention, the implants or trial implants, including the chisel, are in the form of set.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel pre-trial implant for the preparation of an intervertebral space for insertion of an intervertebral disc prosthesis, having a 5 superior and inferior bearing surface, in particular for radiographic and geographic orientation in the intervertebral space, the pre-trial implant being produced substantially from an X-ray-transparent, approximately rectangular or trapezoidal frame which contains a compound slide which is formed from two X-ray-visible spindles and carries a carriage body which is firmly connected to a o positioning bar which is oriented at an angle to the two spindles which corresponds to the approach angle (e), the positioning bar projecting through the frame.<br>
According to a particular development, the carriage body carries X-ray-visible 5 markers.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel device for keeping an intervertebral space open for a discectomy and/or for the insertion of an implant or trial implant or pre-trial implant according to one of the preceding specifications, said device 0 being formed from two struts which are independent of one another and can be selected from a group of leaf-like, different struts, the two struts having a wedge shape at the angle of lordosis in their proximal region and optionally being medially curved at their proximal end.<br>
According to the invention, the struts are toothed in their proximal region at their edges facing the vertebrae, and have a coupling device at their distal end for direct or indirect connection to an attachment frame (e.g. Synframe®, trademark of Synthes).<br>
9<br><br>
In order to facilitate the access to the vertebrae, at least one of the two struts is angled in the medial direction in its distal region. At least one of the two struts can be reduced in height between its proximal and its distal region.<br>
According to the invention, the two struts can be connected by means of connecting pieces at their distal end, and the connecting piece can be connected to a handle, preferably by means of a detachable coupling, the handle having guide elements for laterally supporting the struts.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel assembly tool for assembling an intervertebral disc implant having a superior and an inferior implant plate and an inlay -in particular according to one of the preceding specifications - with a baseplate and a base as well as a collet in the base, the collet being formed for interlocking with an implant plate, and a batten-like guided sliding element which has an interlocking receptacle for the inlay is coordinated with the base, the two implant plates and inlay being capable of being placed in their receptacles so that they are correctly positioned relative to one another and lock with one another after insertion of the sliding element with inserted implant plate and inserted inlay.<br>
According to a preferred development, the base and the sliding element are slideably connected to one another by means of a parallel guide.<br>
The invention also comprises a novel inserter for inserting a trial implant or an implant according to one of the preceding specifications, having a hand grip of a bar and a retaining mechanism, the retaining mechanism having a locking part and an implant collet, and the implant collet having a locking lever which, in the inserted state, can hold an implant in the implant collet or release it in a controlled manner, and the actuation of the locking part and of the locking lever being effected by a rod or by an actuating part guided in a rod.<br>
According to a particular further development of the inserter, a rod carrying a hand grip at its distal end, an actuating handle which is connected to the actuating part in the rod is provided in the region of the hand grip.<br>
A locking lever of this inserter is preferably medially curved at its free proximal end in order thus - in the locked state- to secure a trial implant or an implant also to prevent loss in the proximal direction.<br>
In order to permit size adaptations for individual use of implants and in order to be able better to design it as set, the implant collet is, according to the invention, designed in a plurality of parts and comprises a collet which can be selected from a group which can be fixed by means of the locking part to a rod, the respective collet being formed diametrically oppositely to the distal part of the respective trial implant or respective implant. The fixing of the respective collet to the locking part is effected by means of at least one guide pin which is longitudinally displaceable together with the locking part on the rod.<br>
In a further embodiment, the inserter comprises a device for holding and inserting a superior implant plate and an inferior implant plate of an intervertebral implant, said inserter comprising a device by means of which the inlay can be introduced by left oblique anterior insertion at about 45° after insertion of the two implant plates with spreading thereof.<br>
The invention also includes an intervertebral implant in the form of an intervertebral disc prosthesis having a superior implant plate, an inferior implant plate and an inlay having at least one anchorage keel (for anchorage each in a superior and in an inferior adjacent vertebra) of a spine, the anchorage keel, in the installed state, lying in a plane which extends at about 45° to the medial plane of the spine.<br>
According to a particular development, this anchorage keel has cockscomb-like teeth at its free end facing the respective vertebra, the toothed system having an inclination which facilitates insertion but<br>
10<br><br>
prevents removal, by virtue of the fact that the flanks of the teeth in the distal direction have a shallower inclination than the flanks of the teeth in the proximal direction.<br>
This intervertebral implant or implant is coated with a titanium foam or granular titanium over the predominant part of its surface so that it can better integrate with the bones.<br>
The devices, equipment and instruments are used in a method according to the invention for the insertion of an intervertebral implant into an intervertebral space between a superior and an inferior vertebra, the intervertebral implant comprising a superior implant plate, an inferior implant plate and an inlay, and the intervertebral implant being inserted at about 45° with a left oblique anterior approach into at least one prepared groove each in the superior and inferior vertebra.<br>
According to the invention, in a variant, the intervertebral implant can be inserted all in one, or first the two implant plates can be inserted at about 45° and then the inlay can be inserted using an instrument according to the invention at about 45°.<br>
Preferably, each prepared groove for one keel each of the implant plates in the superior and inferior vertebra makes an angle of 90° with the respective intervertebral surface.<br>
An X-ray observation using the sighting slots and/or the guide slot is preferably made during the insertion and positioning of the implant or trial implant.<br>
In the method for the preparation of an intervertebral space through removal of the intervertebral disc and subsequent chiselling of at least one groove each into the superior and inferior vertebrae, a trial implant is pushed into the intervertebral space and is held by the vertebrae under the tension of the muscles.<br>
A trapezoidal guide of a chisel is then inserted into a trapezoidal guide slot, this guide slot and the guide holding the chisel at about 90° to the respective intervertebral surface and at an invariable normal distance. The chisel which is longitudinally displaceable relative to the guide is then tapped stepwise into the respective vertebra up to a stop. Both the insertion of the trial implant and the chiselling are effected at about 45° relative to the medial plane..<br>
The method using the devices and instruments according to the invention for positioning and fixing an intervertebral implant in the intervertebral space therefore preferably comprises the following steps:<br>
in a first step, a trial implant adapted to the intervertebral space is positioned in the cleaned<br>
intervertebral space (with or without struts) at a surgical approach angle e of about 45°,<br>
in a second step, one groove each is tapped into the superior and inferior vertebrae, normal to the<br>
respective intervertebral surface, using a chisel guided in the trial implant, and<br>
in a third step, struts are used laterally with respect to the trial implant,<br>
in a fourth step, the trial implant is removed<br>
and in a fifth step, the implant is inserted either all in one completely with both implant plates<br>
and the inlay using an inserter according to the invention, or, using another inserter, first upper<br>
and lower part of the implant and then the inlay are inserted.<br>
The positioning of the trial implant in the intervertebral space is effected with the aid of a shank<br>
mounted on the trial implant, under radiographic<br>
monitoring, using sighting slots in the trial implant and optionally by impacts on impact hollows<br>
at the periphery.<br>
By turning the adjusting screw of the adjustable stop using a screwdriver, a trial implant inserted<br>
a track too far can also be pulled back.<br>
11<br><br>
The trunk of the trial implant is, if required, fixed by means of the impact shank on a frame (Synframe®, trademark of Synthes) or held by a person.<br>
In an alternative method according to the invention, for increasing the accuracy of fit, the chisel guided in the trial implant is left in the superior or inferior groove after the chiselling, and the opposite groove is then chiselled using a further chisel.<br>

The carriage body 78 of the pre-trial implant 79 (Fig. 70-73) can also carry an X-ray-visible marker 96.<br>
For keeping the intervertebral space 62 (Fig. 64, 65) open for the discectomy and/ or for the insertion of an implant 5, 6, 7 or trial implant 9 or pre-trial implant 79, according to the invention two struts 20, 21 (Fig.81, 82) independent of one another and selectable from a group of leaf-like, different struts are formed, the two struts 20, 21 being wedge-shaped at the angle of lordosis in their proximal area and being medially curved at their proximal end.<br>
The struts 20, 21 (Fig. 64, 65) may be toothed (Fig. 81 , 82) in their proximal area 81 at their edges 82 facing the vertebrae and may have, at their distal end, a coupling device 83 (Fig. 79, 80) for direct or indirect connection to an attachment frame 84, e.g. Synframe®.<br>
According to the invention, at least one of the two struts 20, 21 (Fig. 81 , 82) is bent medially in its distal area 85, when at least one of the two struts 20, 21 can be formed with reduced height between its proximal and its distal area.<br>
The two struts can be connected at their distal end 86 (Fig. 81 , 82) by means of the connecting piece 87, and the connecting piece 87 can also be connected to a handle 86 - preferably by means of detachable coupling 89 (Fig. 79,80).<br>
The handle 86 of the struts 20, 21 may have guide elements 90 for lateral support (Fig. 79).<br>
According to the invention, an assembly tool 18 (Fig. 63a-e) is provided for assembling an intervertebral disc implant according to the invention having a superior and an inferior implant plate<br>
22<br><br>
5, 7 and an inlay 6. The assembly tool 18 has a baseplate 91 and a base 92 and a collet 93a,b in the base 92. The collet 93a is formed for interlocking with an implant plate 5 or 7. A batten-like guided sliding element 94 which has an interlocking collet 93b for the inlay 6 is coordinated with the base 92. The two implant plates 5, 7 and the inlay 6 can be placed in their collet in such a way that they are correctly positioned relative to one another and, after insertion of the sliding element 94, locked with one another. The base 92 of the assembly tool and the sliding element 94 are connected to one another in a slidable manner by means of parallel guide 95, e.g. by pins 23a,b.<br>
The intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 (Fig. 10-14) for insertion into a superior vertebra 1 and an inferior vertebra 2, having a superior part 5, an inferior part 7 and an inlay 6, is designed, according to the invention, as an all-in-one intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 (Fig. 64, 65), and it can be inserted at 45° by means of a left oblique anterior approach into a prepared groove 3, 4 in the superior vertebra 1 or inferior vertebra 2 by means of an instrument 13 for insertion at 45°. In the case of a variant according to the invention, the intervertebral implant 5, 7 can be inserted without inlay 6, the inlay 6 subsequently being inserted using another instrument 16 for insertion at 45° (Fig. 97).<br>
The prepared groove 3, 4 (Fig. 59, 60, 64) in the superior vertebra 1 or inferior vertebra 2 makes an angle of 90° with the respective intervertebral surface in order to permit the best possible retention according to the invention.<br>
Using the instrument 13 (Fig.33-35, 64-66) for inserting an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 at 45°, an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 comprising 3 parts all in one can be held and can be inserted at 45° by means of an oblique anterior approach into the intervertebral space.<br>
Using an alternative instrument 16 (Fig. 97) for inserting an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 at 45°, first the upper part 5 and lower part 7 of an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 can be held at about 45° and then the inlay 6 can be inserted at the same angle of about 45° by means of a left oblique anterior approach.<br>
The components of the implant are preferably offered as a set in a sterilizable box.<br>
EXAMPLE OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION<br>
After opening of the abdominal cavity for an approach at 45° on the patient's left side, first the intervertebral disc is removed (discectomy) and the intermediate space is cleaned.<br>
For maintaining the distance, the struts 20, 21 or the alternative variant of the struts 100, 101 can be inserted at this point. By tapping on the impact head 104 with recesses 105a,b for screwdriver 53 and impact pipe 106, the struts 100, 101 which are guided by the rails 107a,b can slide into the intervertebral space.<br>
A trial implant 9 (Fig. 20-23) is then inserted. Corresponding to the size of the vertebrae, the trial implant 9 is present in the set sizes M or L and the various angles of lordosis. On the basis of his experience and through insertion of different variants, the surgeon finds the optimum size. The position of the implant is of considerable importance, and the trial implant 9 is therefore exactly aligned by the surgeon with radiographic monitoring, by tapping onto the notches 24a and 24b. An adjustable stop 17 prevents the trial implant 9 from penetrating too far into the intervertebral space. By turning the adjusting screw of the adjustable stop 17 by means of a screwdriver, the stopper can be turned forwards or backwards by about 9 mm. A trial implant 9 which has been inserted a track too far can thus be retracted again.<br>
Alternatively, in order to find the exact middle for the implant, a pre-trial implant (Fig. 70-73), which is likewise aligned by means of X-ray monitoring, can be used.<br>
23<br><br>
The shank 22 of the trial implant 9 is fixed on the Synframe®, and only thereafter is the chisel 10 introduced into the slot of the trial implant 9, and the upper or the lower groove is chiselled into the upper or lower vertebra by tapping on the impact head (Fig. 53-58).<br>
The groove must be at right angles to the respective intervertebral surface so that the implant rests against the superior and inferior surface with interlocking. According to the invention, the surgeon leaves the chisel in the bone after the upper chiselling and then performs the lower chiselling with a second chisel which results in better correspondence of the grooves with the implant keels.<br>
After the upper and lower grooves have been chiselled in the bones (Fig.61 , 62), struts 20, 21 are introduced now at the latest to the left and right of the trial implant, unless they are already present, and the trial implant is removed.<br>
The final implant 5, 6, 7 is now inserted (Fig. 67).<br>
There are 2 variants.<br>
In the first one, the inlay is inserted only after the upper and lower implant parts 5 and 7 have been<br>
pushed into the bone.<br>
The insertion of an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 (Fig. 10-14) with subsequent insertion of the inlay 6 is<br>
effected using an instrument 16 (Fig. 97).<br>
In the second "all-in-one" variant, the entire implant is inserted immediately. The insertion of an intervertebral implant 5, 6, 7 all in one is effected using an instrument 13 (Fig. 33-35).<br>
When the implant fits correctly, which is likewise monitored by means of X-rays, the struts 20, 21 according to the invention (Fig. 67, 81, 82) are removed and the abdominal cavity is closed again by a conventional surgical method.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to the preparation of an intervertebral space with a trial implant (9), the insertion of an implant (5, 6, 7), the inserters (13, 16), and the method for feeding and inserting the implant (5, 6,7) by means of an oblique anterior approach. In the novel improved method, the associated instruments (13,16) for inserting an implant (5, 6, 7) into an intervertebral space, in particular for the lumbar spine at an oblique anterior angle of 45° was developed, the left side of the body being preferred for insertion of the implant (5, 6, 7). Either the implant (5, 6, 7) can be inserted all in one, or first the upper part (5) and lower parts (7) and then the inlay (6) may be inserted. By insertion by means of the left oblique<br>
anterior approach at 45°, optimum utilization of the area of the intervertebral space is ensured (footprint), and better retention of the implant is guaranteed by the exact chiselling at an angle of 90° normal to the respective intervertebral surface.<br>
