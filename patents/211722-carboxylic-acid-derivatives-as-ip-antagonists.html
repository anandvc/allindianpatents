	It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of formula I are especially useful<br>
as prostaglandin IP (I2 or PGL) antagonists. Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PGs) are a group of bioactive compounds derived from membrane phospholipids and are formed from 20-carbon essential fatty acids containing three, four, or five double bonds, and a cyclopentane ring. They fall into several main classes designated by the letters D, E, F, G, H, or I, and they are distinguished by substitutions to the cyclopentane ring. The main classes are further subdivided by subscripts 1, 2, or 3, which reflect their fatty acid precursors. Thus, PGI2 has a double ring structure, and the subscript 2 indicates that it is related to .arachidonic acid.<br>
PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin) acts on platelets and blood vessels to inhibit aggregation and to cause vasodilation, and is thought to be important for vascular homeostasis. It has been suggested that PGI2 may contribute to the antithrombogenic properties of the intact vascular wall. PGI2 is also thought to be a physiological modulator of vascular tone that functions to oppose the actions of vasoconstrictors. The importance of these vascular actions is emphasized by the participation of PGL in the hypotension associated with septic shock. Although prostaglandins do not appear to have direct effects on vascular permeability, PGI2 markedly enhances edema formation and leukocyte infiltration by promoting blood flow in the inflamed region. Therefore, IP receptor antagonists may prevent conditions associated with excessive bleeding such as, but not limited to, hemophilia and hemorrhaging, may relieve hypotension related to septic shock, and may reduce edema formation.<br>
Several in vivo analgesia studies in rodents suggest thatPGIs plays a major role in'the induction of hyperalgesia. Likewise, in vitro studies provide substantial evidence to suggest that "PGl2-preferring" (IP) receptors act as important modulators of sensory neuron function (K.Bley et al, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 1998,19(4), 141-147.). Since IP receptors in sensory neurons are coupled to activation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and hence, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, these receptors can exert powerful effects on ion channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release. Evidence of a prominent role foY IP receptors in inflammatory pain has been obtained froni recent studies in transgenic mice lacking the IP receptor (T. Murata et al, Nature 1997, 388,679-682<br><br>
In addition to being mediators of hyperalgesia, prostaglandins are known to be generated locally in the bladder in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle, injuries of the vesical mucosa, and nerve stimulation (K. Anderson, Pharmacological Reviews 1993, 45(3), 253-308). PGI2 is the major prostaÂ¬glandin released from the human bladder. There are some suggestions that prostaglandins may be the link between detrusor muscle stretch produced by bladder filling and activation of C-fiber afferents by bladder distension. It has been proposed that prostaglandins may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder disorders. Therefore, antagonists of prostaglandin IP receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such conditions.<br>
Antagonists of IP receptors are also expected to find a utility in respiratory allergies wherein PGI2 production in response to an allergen is present, or in respiratory conditions such as asthma.<br>
Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors is described in Goodman &amp; Gillman's, The Pharmacological Basis ofTherapeutics, ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616.<br>
Thus antagonists which can selectively treat the above mentioned conditions by acting on the IP receptor, are desirable.<br>

Hoffmann-La Roche AG refers to certain N-hydroxyalkyl amino acid amide derivatives as inhibitors of renin for treating hypertension.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n=10). To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized<br>
with halothane and administered 1% carrageenan or vehicle 1 (100 Âµ1) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Rats were administered vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.or 1 ml/kg, i.v) or compounds of this invention (at 1, 3,10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or (0.3,1.0, 3.0 and lOmg/kg, i.v.) one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The vehicle- or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw. The force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point.<br>
Treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force (RESP). Pairwise comparisons for the drug-treated groups to the vehicle group were made using Fisher's LSD strategy and Dunn's procedure. Percent inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated for each animal, and the average ID50 value was estimated using the following sigmoidal model:<br>
% inhibition = 100 / (1 + exp ((IDso-dose) / N))<br>
where ID50 is the dose of the compound needed to inhibit half of the maximum I    response (i.e., 100% in this model) and N is a curvature parameter.<br>

EXAMPLE 25<br>
Complete Freund's Adjuvant-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay<br>
The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention may also be determined using an adjuvant-induced arthritis pain model in the rat, where pain is assessed by the animal's response to the squeezing of the inflamed foot, using a modification of the method described in J. Hylden et al Pain 1989, 37, 229-243. The modification includes the assessment of hyperalgesia instead of changes in activity of spinal cord neurons.<br>
Briefly, rats were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and 100 Âµl of Complete Freund's Adjuvant or saline was administered into the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. 24 hours later, water (vehicle) or compounds of this invention were orally administered to the rats 1 hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The saline or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw, and the force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. The treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force. Percent inhibition was calculated for each animal in the form:<br>
100 X ((c/d -c/v) - (s/v - c/v))<br>
where c/d is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which drug has been administered; c/v is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered; and s/v is the paw     withdrawal force for the saline-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered. Significance was determined using Student's t-test.<br>

Inhibition of Bladder Contractions Induced by Isovolumetric Bladder Distension in Rats<br>
The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in C.A. Maggi et al, J. Pharm. and Exper. Therapeutics, 1984.230,500-513.<br>
Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. A catheter was inserted through the urethra into the bladder to induce bladder contractions, and a warm saline solution (5 ml) was infused. Rhythmic contractions were produced in about 30% of the animals. The compounds of the invention (0.1,0.3 or 1 mg/kg) were administered intravenous at the onset of regular rhythmic contractions. The effects on rhythmic contracts were then measured.<br>
The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 27<br>
Inhibition of Volume-Induced Contractions in Rats<br>
The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in S.S. Hegde et al, Proceedings of the 26th Annual Meeting of the International Continence Society (August 27th-30th) 1996, Abstract 126.<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane and instrumented for intravenous administration of drugs and, in some cases, measurement of arterial pressure, heart rate and intra-bladder pressure. The effect of test compounds on volume-induced bladder contractions was determined in separate groups of animals. Volume-induced reflex bladder contractions were induced by filling the bladder with saline. The test compounds were administered intravenously in a cumulative manner at 10-minute intervals. Atropine (0.3 mg/kg, iv) was administered at the end of the study as a postive control.<br>
The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 28<br>
Reversal of Endotoxin-Induced Hypotension in Rats<br>
Septic shock, sometimes referred to as endotoxic shock, is caused by the presence of infectious agents, particularly bacterial endotoxins, in the bloodstream and is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction. Many symptoms of septic shock, in particular, hypotension, are induced in the rat by the administration of bacterial endotoxins. The ability of a compound to inhibit endotoxin-induced hypotension is therefore predictive of the utility of the compound in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock was determined by measuring the reversal of endotoxin-induced hypotension in the rat, using a modification of the method described in M. Giral et al, British Journal of Pharmacology, 1969,118,1223-1231.<br>
Briefly, adult rats (&gt;200 g) were anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic and femoral arteries and veins were cannulated for insertion of blood pressure transducers and drug administration lines, respectively. They were placed in Mayo restrainers while still under the influence of the anesthetic. After recovery from anesthesia and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure (which typically required about 30 minutes), endotoxin (50 mg/kg E. coli and 25 mg/kg Salmonella) was administered intravenously. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. After one hour, compounds of this invention or vehicle were also administered intravenously, and cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored for the next three hours. Responses are represented as percentage return to initial diastolic blood pressure. Significance was determined using Student's t-test.<br>
The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 29<br>
Carbaprostacyclin Induced Writhing Test<br>
The analgesic properties of these compounds was investigated with the carbaprostacyclin induced writhing test. The rats (100-130 g) are weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n = 8). Each animal is administered vehicle, reference substance or test substance at a dose and dose volume determined by the study director. At the appropriate time after drug dose (peak time of action for test compound), carba-prostacyclin (30 |ig/kg, 2 ml/kg, i.p.) is administered. Following carbaprostacyclin administration, the rats are placed in individual plexiglas cages. Writhes are counted for<br><br>
15 minutes beginning 5 minutes following carbaprostacyclin administration. A writhe consists of a dorsiflexion or strong contraction of the abdominal musculature with simultaneous stretching.<br>
Group comparisons: The treatment groups and the negative control (vehicle + the inducing agent) are compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons between the negative control and each treatment group are made using Fisher's LSD test with Bonferroni's adjustment if the overall difference is not significant. The ranked data are applied in the analysis. The positive control group is compared to the negative control group using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for assay verification.<br>
Estimation of ID50: The % inhibition is calculated for each animal in the form'of 100 * (1 - (number of writhes / mean writhes for the vehicle group)). The ID50 is estimated using the following sigmoidal model: % inhibition = 100 / (1 + (ID5o/dose)N),where ID50 is the dose for the compound to achieve half of the maximum response (50%) in the dose response curve, N is the curvature parameter. The maximum response is assumed 100% in the model.<br>
