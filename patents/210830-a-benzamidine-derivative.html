[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to benzamidine derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts having excellent inhibitory activity against factor Xa.   This invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as an active ingredient for prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disorder.   In another aspect, this invention relates to the use of said compounds in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disorder.   In another aspect, this invention relates to a method for the prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disorder, which method comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of said compounds to a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment.   In yet another aspect, this invention relates to a process for the preparation of said compounds.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Recently the number of patients with cardiovascular diseases is increasing in accordance with the increase in the elderly population.  Among these diseases, thrombotic diseases such as cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction and peripheral occlusive diseases not only lead to death, but also cause a significant limitation in the individual and social lives of patients which have a poor prognosis.   Thus, it is suggested that anticoagulant therapy against thrombotic diseases is becoming increasingly important.<br>
Blood coagulation involves a complex cascade of enzymatic reactions that can be triggered by an initial stimulus, and amplified to terminate in the thrombin-catalyzed conversion of the soluble fibrinogen to the insoluble plasma protein fibrin.  This process is known as the blood coagulation cascade and comprises the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways. The activated factor X (factor Xa) is a key enzyme at the point of convergence of both coagulation pathways.   It forms a complex with bivalent calcium ions, phospholipids and factor Xa to efficiently convert prothrombin<br><br>
2<br>
to thrombin, and thereby accelerates blood coagulation [e.g., E.L. Smith, A. White et al., 'Principles of Biochemistry': Mammalian Biochemistry, 7th edition, McGraw-Hill, Inc. (1983), etc.].<br>
Warfarin and thrombin inhibitors are currently used as anticoagulants.   Although warfarin is a widely used as an orally active antithrombotic agent, it has significant clinical limitations.   The anti-coagulant activity of warfarin is antagonized by vitamin K, and is often affected by interactions with the diet or commonly used drugs [e.g., Clin. Pharmacokinet.. 30, 416 (1996)].   In addition, currently available thrombin inhibitors carry a hemorrhage risk as adverse events associated with their pharmacological actions, and thus novel anti-coagulants need to be developed.   Since factor Xa affects thrombin formation and factor Xa inhibitors are known to exert anti-coagulant activities, factor Xa inhibitors are suggested to become a novel type of anti-coagulant [e.g.. Drugs. 49, 856 (1995)].<br>
Aromatic amidine derivatives or amidinonaphthyl derivatives are described as competitive factor Xa inhibitors in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei 5-208946 (EP 540051), WO 96/16940 (EP 798295) or WO 00/47553.   Further, benzamidine derivatives such as N-[4-[1-acettmidoyl-4-piperidyloxy]phenyl]-N-[2-(3-amidinophenoxy)ethyl]sulfamoylacetic acid bis(trifluoroacetate) are described in WO 98/31661 (EP 976722).<br>
[Disclosure of the invention]<br>
The inventors studied the pharmacological actions of various benzamidine derivatives for many years to develop compounds with excellent anti-factor Xa activity.   Our study resulted in the finding that benzamidine derivatives with specific substituents exhibit excellent anti-factor Xa activity, but do not exhibit anti-trypsin activity which is associated with adverse events.   Furthermore, these derivatives are useful for the prophylaxis and therapy (particularly therapy) of blood coagulation disorders.   These results led to the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to benzamidine derivatives and their<br><br>
3<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts having excellent inhibitory activity against factor Xa.   This invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as an active ingredient for the prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disorder.   In another aspect, this invention relates to the use of said compounds in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disorder.   In another aspect, this invention relates to a method for the prevention or treatment of a blood coagulation disprder, which method comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of said compounds to a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment.   In yet another aspect, this invention relates to a process for the preparation of said compounds.<br>

(e)	removal of the protecting group of any protected hydroxyl group.<br><br>

Determination of Anti-factor Xa Activity.<br>
Anti-factor Xa activity was determined according to the method of Hara et al. (Thromb. Haemost, 71, 314 (1994), with slight modifications.  A 50 mM tris-HCI buffer (pH 8.4) containing 0.9 % NaCI, 0.4 mM chromogenic substrate, S-2222 (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and a test compound were mixed, and the reaction was started by adding 0.25 unit/ml human factor Xa (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).   Distilled water instead of the test compound was added to the buffer in the control group. The reaction mixture in a total volume of 0.1 ml was incubated for 5 min at room-temperature.   The absorbance at 405 nm was measured continuously using a 96-well microplate reader (model 550, BioRad), and the increase in absorbance for 5 min was calculated as an index of factor Xa activity.   The IC50 values, the concentration at which the compound inhibits factor Xa activity by 50 %, was determined to estimate the anti-factor Xa activity of the test compound.<br>
