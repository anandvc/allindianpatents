				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
FUEL PUMP UNIT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel pump unit.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Conventionally, a fluid pump is known in which a fluid pump unit that is<br>
provided with an intake aperture and in which a pump and a drive motor are formed<br>
integrally is immersed in a fluid and discharges the fluid to the outside. This type of<br>
fluid pump is widely used to discharge fluid from a fluid tank. For example, an in-tank<br>
type of fuel pump such as this is also used in fuel tanks of motorcycles and the like.<br>
Among such fuel pumps, a fuel pump that is highly reliable and that can be mounted in a<br>
small sized fuel tank and can rapidly supply clean fuel that does not cause a fuel injection<br>
valve to become blocked is demanded. Therefore, a fuel pump exists that causes fuel to<br>
infiltrate interior sections thereof enabling the motor to be cooled and movable parts to<br>
be lubricated so as to improve reliability, and that is provided with a barrier filter that<br>
removes dirt generated by the movable parts in front of the discharge aperture, and in<br>
which the barrier filter is formed integrally with the pump section and motor section so<br>
as to achieve a reduction in size.<br>
For example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.<br>
2002-285930 (Document 1), there is disclosed a motor type of fuel pump that is provided<br>
with a pump chamber and a motor chamber, and that is provided with a filter that is<br>
positioned upstream of the discharge path inside the motor chamber so as to cover an<br>
outer circumference of the motor.<br>
Pumps are also known that do not infiltrate fuel in the motor, but feed fuel<br>
directly using a pump.<br>
In Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei<br>
11-230076 (Document 2), there is disclosed a fuel pressure feed unit that is provided with<br>
a toroidal chamber in which an electric motor is housed in a central chamber, and in<br>
which a fuel main filter that is partitioned by a partition wall of a casing is positioned at<br>
an outer periphery of the electric motor, and that discharges fuel after feeding it to the<br>
toroidal chamber using a pump.<br>
However, the following problems exist in conventional fuel pumps such as those<br>
described above.<br>
In the technology described in Document 1, the rotation shaft of an outer rotor<br>
that drives an impeller of the pump to rotate is provided inside a motor chamber and is<br>
supported by a bearing that is provided in a lower fitting section and by a bearing that is<br>
positioned inside a stator provided in a bearing holding cover. The bearing holding<br>
cover is fixed by another end thereof being riveted to a pump case.<br>
In this type of structure, when the bearing holding cover is being riveted, the<br>
bearing holding cover tends to deform so that the gap between the bearing and the<br>
rotation shaft changes easily. Therefore, the problem arises that unevenness tends to<br>
occur in the rotation load caused by manufacturing errors and the like. If there is a large<br>
rotation load, the bearing is easily cut away and, as a result of dirt such as shavings from<br>
this cutting increasing, the reliability of the apparatus deteriorates.<br>
Even if the apparatus can be assembled with few manufacturing errors, because<br>
a bearing supporting cover supports the internal pressure in the motor chamber, the<br>
bearing supporting cover is deformed by internal pressure when the pump is in operation.<br>
In particular, in a fuel pump of a motorcycle and the like in which rapid fuel injection is<br>
required, the discharge pressure of the fuel is also large, and as a result, the bearing gap is<br>
narrowed and the rotation load is increased, which consequently causes lockups to occur.<br>
If the bearing support cover is fitted to the rotation shaft via a bearing, the<br>
structure is such that it is not possible to view the rotation shaft, thereby creating the<br>
problem that assembly is difficult.<br>
The rotation shaft of the outer rotor that drives the impeller of the pump to rotate<br>
is positioned inside the motor chamber and is supported by the bearing that is provided in<br>
the lower fitting section and by the bearing that is positioned inside the stator provided in<br>
the bearing holding cover. A filter is provided integrally inside the motor chamber in<br>
the same way so as to surround the outer circumference of the rotor yoke of the outer<br>
rotor.<br>
Accordingly, fuel is unable to flow easily to the bearing that is provided inside<br>
the stator and is covered by the outer rotor, so that dirt such as abrasion powder and the<br>
like created by the rotation of the motor is easily accumulated.<br>
In the motor chamber, because a fuel flow is generated constantly in a peripheral<br>
direction on the filter surface as the outer rotor rotates, the prosection of dirt absorbed in<br>
the filter that falls off once again and meanders around the interior of the motor chamber<br>
increases. As a result, it is difficult to keep the interior of the motor clean, thereby<br>
causing the bearing to be damaged and causing the fuel pump to break down when there<br>
is a reverse flow of dirt inside the pump chamber.<br>
The pump discharge path that is provided in a vertical direction directly above<br>
the impeller must be positioned on an inner side of the filter in the motor chamber.<br>
Therefore, if the outer diameter of the pump is increased in order to speed up the<br>
circumferential speed, the position of the filter needs to be moved towards the outer<br>
circumferential side so that the size of the fuel pump is increased.<br>
In contrast, in the technology of Document 2, because the electric motor is<br>
positioned in a central chamber partitioned by a partition wall of the casing, although<br>
abrasion powder from the electric motor does not become mixed into the fuel, and it is<br>
possible to enlarge the outer diameter of the pump impeller while keeping the outer<br>
diameter of the fuel pump small, the problem remains that cleaning and lubrication of the<br>
electric motor is still not possible.<br>
If a small amount of fuel infiltrates into the central chamber and is turned into a<br>
gas, the possibility exists that the fuel will be ignited by an electrical discharge or the<br>
like.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The fuel pump unit according to the present invention is a fuel pump unit in<br>
which a pump section, which takes in and pressure feeds fuel, and a motor section, which<br>
has a motor rotor one end of whose rotation shaft is fixed to the pump section, are<br>
provided inside a pump housing having an intake aperture and a discharge aperture, and<br>
in which a fuel flow path is formed inside the motor section. One end side of the<br>
rotation shaft of the motor rotor is rotatably supported by a bracket member, a motor<br>
housing that covers the motor rotor in the circumferential direction is mounted to the<br>
bracket member, and a bearing section that rotatably supports another end of the rotation<br>
shaft is formed in the motor housing. As a result, the motor section is made to be<br>
supported by the bracket member and not by the pump housing.<br>
According to this invention, the gap in the bearing section can be properly<br>
secured without any deformation occurring in the motor section when the motor section<br>
is mounted to the pump housing. The pump section and motor housing can be<br>
assembled in separate steps.<br>
It is also possible for a gap to be formed in an axial direction and circumferential<br>
direction of the motor section between the motor section and the pump housing, and for<br>
the fuel flow path to be formed by this gap.<br>
In this case, a fuel flow is formed at least along the bearing section provided at<br>
an outer circumferential section of the motor housing and at the distal end section in the<br>
mounting direction thereof.<br>
It is also possible for a mounting section that protrudes in the shape of a wall to<br>
be provided on a motor rotor side of the bracket member, and for the motor housing to be<br>
mounted so as to be fitted to the mounting section.<br>
In this case, even if bending moment from the motor section acts on the bracket<br>
member, it is possible to suppress deformation of the plate-shaped section. Assembly of<br>
the motor housing is thus simplified.<br>
It is also possible for a through hole running in an axial direction to be provided<br>
in the bearing section that enables a shaft end section of the rotation shaft of the motor<br>
rotor to be viewed from the bearing section mounting direction at least at a time when the<br>
motor section is assembled by fitting the other end of the rotation shaft in the bearing<br>
section.<br>
In this case, because it is possible using the through hole provided in the bearing<br>
section to view the shaft end section of the rotation shaft of the motor rotor from the<br>
direction from which it is mounted in the bearing section when the motor section is being<br>
assembled, assembly is simplified.<br>
It is also possible for a cap member that substantially covers a distal end side in<br>
the mounting direction of the motor housing to be inserted and fitted in the axial<br>
direction of the motor housing, and for the bearing section to be provided in the cap<br>
member.<br>
In this case, it is difficult for the bearing section to be deformed during<br>
assembly.<br>
Here, the fitting is not limited solely to stop gap fitting and includes intermediate<br>
fitting and tight fitting, provided that there are no deforming effects on the bearing<br>
section. Namely, the insertion may also be a press insertion.<br>
It is also possible for the pump housing to be formed by a cylindrical casing<br>
member that extends in an axial direction of the rotation shaft, an inlet cover that has an<br>
intake aperture for the fuel and that covers the impeller between itself and the bracket<br>
member, and an outlet cover that has a discharge aperture for the fuel and that covers the<br>
radial direction of the motor section, and for the inlet cover and the outlet cover to be<br>
fixed respectively to both end sections of the casing member.<br>
In this case, because an inlet cover and outlet cover that require a comparatively<br>
complex configuration starting with the intake aperture and discharge aperture are<br>
formed as separate members, manufacturing is simplified.<br>
It is also possible for at least one of the inlet cover and outlet cover to be fixed<br>
by riveting to the casing member.<br>
In this case, the apparatus can be manufactured easily and at low cost.<br>
It is also possible for the pump section to be formed by placing an impeller<br>
having a larger outer diameter than an outer diameter of the motor housing on a rear<br>
surface of that side of the bracket member to which the motor housing is mounted, and<br>
for the pump section and the motor section to be connected by a pump side connecting<br>
#<br>
flow path that extends from an outer circumferential section of the pump section.<br>
In this case, even if the motor section has a comparatively small diameter, fuel<br>
that is pressure fed by the impeller can be guided to the motor section.<br>
It is also possible for a toroidal chamber to be provided at an outer<br>
circumference of the motor housing, and for a filtration section to be formed by placing a<br>
filtration apparatus for the fuel inside the toroidal chamber.<br>
In this case, the filtration section can be built in while the space that overlaps<br>
with the impeller in the radial direction is effectively used.<br>
It is also possible for the filtration section to be sealed off from the pump<br>
section.<br>
In this case, because the filtration section is sealed off from the pump section, all<br>
the fuel flows to the motor section, and there is no flow from the filtration section<br>
returning directly to the pump section.<br>
It is also possible for the pump side connecting flow path to be provided inside<br>
the bracket member.<br>
In this case, a reduction in space can be achieved.<br>
It is also possible for the pump side connecting flow path to be formed by<br>
covering a section of a groove that is formed in a surface of the bracket member with a<br>
shielding member that abuts against the bracket member.<br>
In this case, the pump side connecting flow path can be formed simply.<br>
It is also possible for the pump side connecting flow path to be provided with a<br>
flow path that is located within a plane that is substantially parallel with a rotation plane<br>
of the impeller and that travels from a vicinity of an outer circumferential section of the<br>
impeller inwards in a radial direction.<br>
In this case, even if dirt or the like flows from the pump section in the axial<br>
direction of the impeller, it is possible to prevent the dirt from reaching a position directly<br>
above the outer circumferential section of the pump section in the axial direction thereof.<br>
It is also possible for the motor section to be formed at one of the bracket<br>
members; for the pump section to be formed at another of the bracket members; for a<br>
filtration section to be formed as a fuel filtration apparatus at an outer circumference of<br>
the motor housing; for a pump side connecting flow path that connects an interior of the<br>
pump section to an interior of the motor section to be provided in a vicinity of a<br>
mounting section of the bracket member and the motor housing; for a filtration side<br>
connecting flow path that connects the motor section and the filtration section to be<br>
provided in the motor housing; and for the fuel that is taken in from the intake aperture to<br>
flow from the pump section along the pump side connecting flow path and into the motor<br>
section, and after the fuel has flowed along the filtration side connecting flow path and<br>
into the filtration section for it to be discharged to the discharge aperture.<br>
In this case, because there is provided a pump side connecting flow path and a<br>
filtration side connecting flow path, and fuel that is taken in from the intake aperture<br>
flows in sequence through the pump section, motor section, and filtration section to the<br>
discharge aperture, dirt such as abrasion powder that is generated from movable sections<br>
within the motor section is transported out, together with the fuel, to the filtration section<br>
and is filtered, and clean fuel can be discharged from the discharge aperture.<br>
It is also possible for there to be provided a cap member that is inserted in the<br>
axial direction of the motor housing and is fitted therein and that substantially covers a<br>
distal end side in the mounting direction of the motor housing, and that also forms the<br>
bearing section; and for a gap that is continuous in at least the radial direction of the<br>
motor housing to be provided between the cap member and the pump housing, and for a<br>
through hole to be provided in a section of the cap member so as to face the gap; and for<br>
the filtration side connecting flow path to be formed by the through hole and the gap.<br>
In this case, because fuel flows via the filtration side connecting flow path from<br>
the through hole in the cap member that is provided in the bearing section along a gap<br>
that is continuous in at least the radial direction to the filtration section at the outer<br>
circumference of the motor housing, a fuel flow path is formed in the vicinity of the<br>
bearing section. As a result, dirt such as abrasion powder and the like that is<br>
generated by the bearing section is efficiently cleaned and transported to the filtration<br>
section.<br>
It is also possible for the bearing section to be provided with an aperture that<br>
faces the filtration side connecting flow path.<br>
In this case, because it is possible for the bearing section to be in contact via<br>
the aperture with the fuel flowing along the filtration side connection flow path, dirt such<br>
as abrasion powder and the like that is generated by the bearing section is efficiently<br>
cleaned and transported to the filtration section.<br>
It is also possible for the cap member to be a brush holder in which is placed a<br>
brush that is abutted against a commutator that is provided in the motor rotor.<br>
In this case, because the cap member above which is formed the filtration side<br>
connecting flow path is a brush holder, dirt such as abrasion powder created by the<br>
contact between the commutator and the brush and the like that is generated by the<br>
bearing section is efficiently cleaned and transported to the filtration section.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference made to the drawings. It is to be understood that the present invention is not<br>
limited by the embodiments given below, for example, component elements of these<br>
embodiments may be combined together as is appropriate.<br>
Fig 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view in the axial direction for describing the<br>
fuel pump unit 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a<br>
cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A in FIG. 1. FIG. 3 A is a plan view looking<br>
in the direction B in FIG. 1. FIG. 3B is a cross-sectional view taken along the line D-D<br>
in FIG. 3A.<br>
The fuel pump unit 1 according to the present embodiment is positioned such<br>
that it is immersed in fuel inside a fuel tank (not shown) of a vehicle or motorcycle or the<br>
like, and takes in fuel that is in the fuel tank via an intake aperture 3 a, and feeds it via a<br>
discharge aperture 1 la to a fuel injection section. As is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the<br>
fuel pump unit 1 has a pump section P that is mounted on a base bracket 2 (i.e., a bracket<br>
member), a motor section M, and a filtration section F. The fuel pump unit 1 also has a<br>
substantially columnar-shaped external configuration that is enclosed by a pump housing<br>
PC that is formed by an inlet cover 3, a pump unit casing 15, and an outlet cover 11.<br>
In order to simplify the description given below, as is shown in FIG. 1, the fuel<br>
pump unit 1 is represented such that a motor shaft 8a (i.e., a rotation shaft) of the pump<br>
section P extends in a vertical direction, and such that the intake aperture 3 a is positioned<br>
below the fuel pump unit 1, while the discharge aperture 1 la is positioned above the fuel<br>
pump unit 1. Relative positions in the axial direction of the fuel pump 1 are referred to<br>
simply as the upper side and lower side. Moreover, in the description of each<br>
component, provided that the upper side (or lower side) of a drawing is not particularly<br>
specified, positions and directions are represented on the basis of an assembly layout<br>
such as that shown in FIG. 1.<br>
However, the actual configurational attitude is not limited to this type of attitude.<br>
For example, the entire fuel pump unit 1 may also be appropriately positioned sloping<br>
away from a vertical direction.<br>
The base bracket 2 is provided with a circular plate shaped plate section 2A that<br>
is positioned in a horizontal direction. A motor housing mounting section 2b (i.e., a<br>
mounting section) and a fuel guide groove 2f (see FIG. 3B) are provided on a motor<br>
section supporting surface 2c, which is a top surface of the plate shaped section 2A. A<br>
pump casing groove 2e is provided on a pump section supporting surface 2d, which is a<br>
bottom surface of the plate shaped section 2A.<br>
A bearing section 2a that holds a shaft in an orthogonal direction relative to the<br>
plate shaped section 2A such that the shaft is able to rotate is provided at a central section<br>
of the plate shaped section 2A. A fuel guide hole 2g (see FIG. 3B) is provided between<br>
the fuel guide groove 2f and the pump casing groove 2e such that it penetrates both.<br>
The motor housing mounting section 2b is a wall shaped section that is provided<br>
in a substantially cylindrical shape extending vertically upwards from the plate shaped<br>
section 2A and substantially coaxially with the center of the plate shaped section 2A. A<br>
motor housing 6, which is described below, is able to be fitted in an axial direction to an<br>
exterior of the motor housing mounting section 2b.<br>
The pump casing groove 2e is shaped as a circular arc on a cross-section in the<br>
radial direction of the plate shaped section 2A, and is provided so as to form a C shape<br>
within the pump section supporting surface 2d running along an outer peripheral section<br>
of an impeller 5, which is described below. As is shown in FIG. 3A, a section from a<br>
casing groove start end section 3S that is provided at a position that overlaps the intake<br>
aperture 3a in the axial direction to a casing groove terminal end section 3E, which is the<br>
terminal end of the C shape, is provided at a position so as to substantially overlap the<br>
pump casing groove 3 c shown in the drawing. The radius of the C shape is larger than<br>
the outer radius of the motor housing 6.<br>
The fuel guide hole 2g is a through hole that penetrates from the pump casing 2e<br>
to the motor section supporting surface 2c side of the casing groove terminal end section<br>
3E. Accordingly, as is shown in FIG. 3B, the upper aperture of the fuel guide hole 2g is<br>
positioned on an outer side in the radial direction of the motor housing 6.<br>
The fuel guide groove 2f is a groove that is provided in a horizontal direction<br>
from the aperture section of the fuel guide hole 2g towards an inner radial side of the<br>
plate shaped section 2A. The fuel guide groove 2f intersects the motor housing<br>
mounting section 2b in a radial direction extending to the inner radial side of the motor<br>
housing mounting section 2b so as to terminate before the bearing section 2a.<br>
The bearing section 2a may be any bearing provided that it is able to radially<br>
support a rotation shaft, and various radial slide bearings can be preferably used. In<br>
particular, bearings whose structure and material enable a lubrication effect to be<br>
obtained as a result of fuel infiltrating gaps in the bearing may be used. The bearing<br>
section 2a may fix a bearing that is formed as a separate member, or may be formed in<br>
the plate shaped section 2A itself.<br>
The pump P is provided with an impeller 5 that is rotatably provided along the<br>
pump section supporting surface 2d, and with a space for pressure feeding fuel that is<br>
formed in the pump casing groove 2e and the pump casing groove 3 c (described below)<br>
and the like and at the periphery of the impeller 5 by covering the impeller 5 from below<br>
using the inlet cover 3. The inlet cover 3 is fixed to the base bracket 2 by a pump unit<br>
casing 15 (described below).<br>
The impeller 5 is formed by a circular plate shaped member that has a shaft hole<br>
in its center for fitting the rotation shaft. A large number of blades 5a having a suitable<br>
airfoil shape that extend vertically for a predetermined length in a radial direction and<br>
that are positioned at a predetermined spacing in a circumferential direction are provided<br>
at outer circumferential sections of the circular plate. The length of the blades 5a in the<br>
radial direction is appropriately set to correspond to the width of the radial direction cross<br>
section of the pump casing groove 2e.<br>
The inlet cover 3 is provided with a sealing surface 3e on an outer<br>
circumferential side of the top surface thereof that can be placed tightly against the pump<br>
section supporting surface 2d. A pump casing section 3b, which is a concave section<br>
that houses the outer circumferential side surfaces and bottom surfaces of the impeller 5<br>
so that each one is a slight distance apart is provided at an inner side in the radial<br>
direction of the sealing surface 3e. An intake aperture 3a is provided at a bottom<br>
surface of the inlet cover 3 so as to open up directly below outer an circumferential<br>
section of the impeller 5.<br>
The pump casing groove 3 c, which is a C shaped groove having substantially the<br>
same shape as the pump casing groove 2e, is formed at a bottom section of the pump<br>
casing section 3 b from the casing groove start end section 3S to the casing groove<br>
terminal end section 3E.<br>
A thrust bearing 4 that supports a rotation shaft such that it can rotate in a thrust<br>
direction is provided at a center section of the pump casing section 3b. The thrust<br>
bearing 4 may be any type of material and have any type of configuration provided that it<br>
has suitable slide properties when immersed in fuel.<br>
The pump section P is structured as is described above. When the impeller 5<br>
rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow in FIG. 3A (i.e., clockwise in FIG. 3A), fuel<br>
is drawn in from the intake aperture 3a, and fuel inside the pump casing grooves 2e and<br>
3 c is raised in pressure between the casing groove start end section 3S and the casing<br>
groove terminal end section 3E by the blades 5a, so that it can be fed to the fuel guide<br>
hole 2g.<br>
This type of pump P may employ a variety of known pump structures that are<br>
known by names such as, for example, centrifugal pumps, volute pumps, and<br>
regenerative pumps.<br>
The motor section M is provided with a motor rotor 8, field magnets 7, a motor<br>
housing 6, and a brush holder 9 (i.e., a cap member). These members form an inner<br>
rotor type of DC motor with an attached brush.<br>
The motor rotor 8 is provided with an armature 8b having a predetermined pole<br>
in a center section of a motor shaft 8a, and is also provided with a commutator 8c at a top<br>
end side of the motor shaft 8a that has a brush contact surface in a radial direction. (In<br>
FIG. 2, because the drawing is schematic, details such as the winding coil of the<br>
commutator 8b have been omitted).<br>
On the bottom side of the armature 8b of the motor shaft 8a, at a distal end<br>
section of the motor shaft 8a that is supported in a radial direction by the bearing section<br>
2a and that protrudes at the bottom side of the bearing section 2a, a shaft distal end<br>
section that is fixed in a shaft hole in the center of the impeller 5 and protrudes<br>
downwards from the impeller 5 is supported in the axial direction by the thrust bearing 4.<br>
The motor housing 6 is a circular cylinder member having apertures at both ends<br>
thereof, the motor housing 6 is externally fitted from above in the axial direction to the<br>
motor housing mounting section 2b, and is mounted vertically above the motor section<br>
supporting surface 2c. By mounting the motor housing 6 in this manner, damage such<br>
as the bearing gap of the bearing section 2a being deformed and narrowed during<br>
assembly is removed, and it is possible to reinforce the external fitting section of the<br>
motor rotor 8 so that it is able to receive a considerable bending moment.<br>
The motor housing 6 can be formed, for example, by cutting a steel pipe or the<br>
like.<br>
The field magnets 7 have a partial cylindrical shape whose outer circumferential<br>
surface can be placed tightly against an inner surface of the motor housing 6. As is<br>
shown in FIG. 2, the field magnets 7 are formed by two permanent magnets that face<br>
each other in the radial direction. The inner circumferential surface of each field<br>
magnet 7 has an inner diameter that forms a predetermined gap between itself and an<br>
outer circumferential surface of the motor rotor 8. Two field magnets 7 are placed<br>
adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction via a spacer 16, and are thrust in<br>
the circumferential direction by a pressing member 17 that faces the spacer 16 in the<br>
radial direction. As a result, they are fixed in predetermined positions relative to the<br>
motor housing 6.<br>
The spacer 16 and the pressing member 17 are both formed so as to be thinner in<br>
the radial direction than the permanent magnets 7. Because of this, between the field<br>
magnets 7 in the circumferential direction, a gap is formed that is continuous in the axial<br>
direction and that is larger than the gap in the radial direction between the field magnets<br>
7 and the motor rotor 8. This structure enables fuel to flow easily through the motor<br>
housing 6 in the axial direction.<br>
The brush holder 9 is a member that is fitted by being inserted into the inner<br>
circumferential surface of a top end section of the motor housing 6 so as to cover the<br>
motor rotor 8 from above. The brush holder 9 is formed by fixing a bearing section 9a<br>
that is formed by a penetrating cylindrical hole that supports a motor shaft 8a in a radial<br>
direction, and a brush 10 that supplies current to the motor rotor 8 by coming into contact<br>
with the commutator 8c from the outer side in the radial direction.<br>
After being fitted, the brush holder 9 is fixed to the motor housing 6 using a<br>
suitable apparatus such that no deformation occurs that may cause a malfunction in the<br>
bearing section 9a. For example, the brush holder 9 may be fixed by providing a<br>
suitable fixing member. This might involve fitting the brush holder using a form that<br>
does not allow the brush holder to be withdrawn such as a snap-fit, or making the fitting<br>
a screw tight fit by using pressure insertion.<br>
Because the bearing section 9a is open in the axial direction, when the brush<br>
holder 9 is assembled by being inserted into the motor housing 6, it is possible to view<br>
the shaft end section of the motor shaft 8b from the direction of insertion, enabling the<br>
ease of assembly to be improved.<br>
The brush holder 9 will now be described in more detail while reference is made<br>
to FIGS. 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D. FIGS. 4A and 4B are an explanatory plan view and an<br>
explanatory front view for describing the brush holder 9 according to the present<br>
embodiment, while FIGS. 4C and 4D are cross-sectional views taken along the lines G-G<br>
and H-H respectively in FIG. 4A.<br>
The brush holder 9 is provided with a concave hole-shaped commutator housing<br>
section 9b for housing the commutator 8c. The commutator housing section 9b is<br>
positioned above a center section of a flange section 9c that extends in a horizontal<br>
direction and covers the aperture section of the motor housing 6. The brush holder 9 is<br>
also provided with a fitting section 9e shaped like a cylindrical wall that is positioned at a<br>
bottom surface in the circumferential direction of the same flange section 9c and fits<br>
inside the motor housing 6.<br>
On the side surface side of the commutator housing section 9b there are<br>
provided brush fixing sections 9f that face in a horizontal direction and into which<br>
brushes 10 are inserted and fixed.<br>
Penetrating holes 9d are provided at two locations on the flange section 9c on an<br>
inner circumferential side of the fitting section 9e. The penetrating holes 9d are<br>
provided in order that the internal pressure generated by the fuel inside the motor section<br>
M is maintained at a constant equilibrium with the external pressure from the fuel in<br>
outer circumferential sections of the motor section M.<br>
A wiring anchoring section 9g is formed by protrusions and grooves and the like<br>
that are provided in order to anchor electrical wiring of the brush 10.<br>
For the material of the brush holder 9 it is possible to employ a synthetic resin<br>
molded product having an appropriate electrical resistance and having sufficient<br>
slidability to allow the bearing section to be formed. By using a synthetic resin molded<br>
product, it is possible to easily form these additional shapes. Even if the fitting section<br>
9e is deformed by pressure insertion, it is difficult for that deformation to reach as far as<br>
the bearing section 9a.<br>
The filtration section F is formed by placing a filter member 12, whose outer<br>
configuration is shaped substantially as a circular cylinder, in a toroidal chamber<br>
enclosed by the pump unit casing 15 that is shaped like a circular cylinder and extends<br>
substantially coaxially with the motor section M so as to enclose an outer circumference<br>
thereof, the base bracket 2 that is fixed below the pump unit casing bracket, the motor<br>
housing 6, and an outlet cover 11 (described below).<br>
The pump unit casing 15 has a top fixing section 15a and a bottom fixing section<br>
15b that have a circular cylinder shape and are formed at a top and bottom aperture end<br>
sections of the pump unit casing 15. The inside diameter of each fixing section is<br>
slightly enlarged, and an inner surface step is formed at a predetermined position in the<br>
axial direction. The base bracket 2 is inserted into the bottom fixing section 15b from<br>
below the pump unit casing 15 and is anchored. When the inlet cover 3 is inserted from<br>
below, by riveting the bottom fixing section 15b to the outer circumferential section of<br>
the inlet cover 3, the base bracket 2 is fixed to the pump unit casing 15.<br>
End sections in a vertical direction of the filter member 12 are anchored<br>
respectively to a top sealing member 14 and a bottom sealing member 13 and are fixed in<br>
position with a gap provided in the radial direction relative to the motor housing 6 and<br>
the pump unit casing 15. This gap in the radial direction forms a flow path facing the<br>
filter member 12 that allows fuel to move in an axial direction and circumferential<br>
direction.<br>
The filter member 12 may be any material and configuration provided that the<br>
filter can be placed inside the toroidal chamber and can filter fuel to the necessary degree<br>
of cleanliness. For example, net type, fabric type, porous type, and granular type of<br>
filters that can filter dirt, such as bearing abrasion powder, which is of a size that may<br>
cause harmful effects to the operation of latter stage fuel injection valves may be<br>
employed.<br>
The bottom sealing member 13 is formed by toroidal plate-shaped packing, and<br>
is positioned so as to be placed tightly against the bottom surface of the motor section<br>
supporting surface 2c, and is also positioned such that an outer circumference and inner<br>
circumference of the toroidal section of the bottom sealing member 13 are in contact in a<br>
circumferential direction respectively with the inner circumferential surface of the pump<br>
unit casing 15 and the outer circumferential surface of the motor housing 6. As a result,<br>
the bottom surface side of the toroidal chamber is sealed, and is kept in a state whereby<br>
fuel cannot directly enter or exit the toroidal chamber from the pump section P.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 3B, the bottom sealing member 13 is formed as a shielding<br>
member that covers the top of the fuel guide groove 2f. As a result, the fuel guide hole<br>
2g and the fuel guide groove 2f form a connecting flow path (i.e., a pump side<br>
connecting flow path) that connects the pump section P with the motor section M.<br>
The top sealing member 14 is formed by the same packing as the bottom sealing<br>
member 13 and an inner circumference of the toroidal section thereof is fixed to the<br>
outlet cover 11.<br>
Here, the outlet cover 11 will be described.<br>
FIG. 5A is a top surface explanatory view for describing the outlet cover 11.<br>
FIG. 5B is a cross-sectional view taken along the line J-J in FIG. 5A.<br>
The outlet cover 11 is circular when viewed from above. The outlet cover 11 is<br>
covered by a plate member except for the discharge aperture 11a that is provided in the<br>
vicinity of the outer circumference of the outlet cover 11. Also, an outer circumference<br>
wall 11b shaped like a circular cylinder wall is provided below the outer circumference<br>
of the plate member. A partition wall 11d shaped like a circular cylinder wall is<br>
provided coaxially in the same direction as the outer circumference wall 11 b at an inner<br>
side in the radial direction of the outer circumference wall 11b.<br>
An outer circumference groove 11c is formed between the partition wall 11d and<br>
the outer circumference wall 11b in the radial direction. The size of the outer<br>
circumference groove 11c is such that when the top sealing member 14 is externally<br>
fitted onto the partition wall 11d, the outer circumference of the top sealing member 14<br>
faces the inner circumference of the partition wall 11d with an appropriate gap being<br>
provided.<br>
A brush guide housing section 11e that is formed in the shape of a concave hole<br>
by the partition wall 11d and the top plate member is formed with a size and<br>
configuration that allows it to house inside itself the top surface side of the brush holder 9<br>
that is above the flange section 9c.<br>
Because the outlet cover 11 does not have any section requiring precise<br>
dimensions such as the bearing section and the like, it may be deformed by internal<br>
pressure so long as it provides sufficient strength against the internal pressure of the<br>
filtration section F. Accordingly, a synthetic resin molded component can be preferably<br>
used for the outlet cover 11. If a synthetic resin molded component is used, then even if<br>
the brush holder 9 has a complex configuration, the outlet cover 11 can easily be formed<br>
in a shape that provides a suitable gap to match the complex configuration. A member<br>
such as an anchor hook 11f used for mounting on the fuel tank can be easily provided<br>
integrally.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 1, the inner circumferential section of the top sealing<br>
member 14 is fixed in the circumferential direction and upward direction to an outer<br>
circumferential section of the partition wall 11d. The outer circumferential wall 1 lb is<br>
fitted inside the top fixing section 15a that is provided at a top end section of the pump<br>
unit casing 15, and is fixed to the top fixing section 15a by riveting. At this time, a gap<br>
19 is formed between the outer circumferential section of the top sealing member 14 and<br>
the inner circumferential surface of the outer circumferential wall 11b that allows fuel<br>
that has passed through the filter member 12 to flow to the discharge aperture 11a.<br>
In a state of assembly such as this, the top surface side of the brush holder 9 has<br>
a suitable gap between itself and the inner surface of the brush guide housing section 11e.<br>
A continuous gap is thus formed that allows fuel to move smoothly in the radial direction<br>
and the circumferential direction. The partition wall 11d and the top sealing member 14<br>
are placed so as to open up a gap 18 in the radial direction with the flange section 9c of<br>
the brush holder 9.<br>
As a result, a filtration side connecting flow path f2 that connects the interior of<br>
the pump section P with the filtration section F is formed by the through hole 9d and the<br>
gap between the brush holder 9 and the inner surface of the outlet cover 11.<br>
Next, the operation of the fuel pump unit 1 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described.<br>
FIG. 6 is a partial enlarged cross-sectional view for describing a fuel flow path<br>
inside the fuel pump unit 1. FIG. 7 is a schematic explanatory view looking in the<br>
direction C in FIG. 1 for describing a connecting flow path f2 on a filtration side.<br>
According to the fuel pump unit 1 of the present embodiment, when the motor<br>
section M is driven so that the impeller 5 is rotated with the fuel pump unit 1 immersed<br>
in a fuel tank or the like, fuel is taken in from the intake aperture 3a and is transported<br>
while the pressure thereof is raised inside the pump casing grooves 2e and 3c. As is<br>
shown by the arrows in the drawings, the fuel, which is at increased pressure, is fed from<br>
the pump section P to the motor section M through the pump side connecting flow path<br>
f1 that is formed by the fuel guide hole 2g, the fuel guide groove 2f, and the bottom<br>
sealing member 13.<br>
The flow of fuel inside the pump section P moves towards the bearing section 2a<br>
and flows so as to lubricate the bearing section 2a. It then flows forward while covering<br>
the motor rotor 8 and field magnets 7 either between the motor rotor 8 and the field<br>
magnets 7 or through the gap in the circumferential direction of the field magnets 7 and 7.<br>
Accordingly, a flow that detours around the vicinity of the commutator 8c is generated.<br>
Either flow enables fuel to be fed from the motor section M to the filtration<br>
section F by the filtration side connecting flow path £2. Not only fuel, but heat and dirt<br>
are also transported. Therefore, the motor rotor 8 and the field magnets 7 are cooled,<br>
and abrasion powder generated by the bearing sections 2a and 9a and by the commutator<br>
8c is removed. At this time, because the filtration side connecting flow path f2 is<br>
provided so as to be connected to the gap in the radial direction above the brush holder 9,<br>
a flow of fuel is also generated in the vicinity of the area above the bearing section 9a, so<br>
that cleaning, lubrication, and cooling of the bearing section 9a can be performed<br>
efficiently.<br>
In the filtration section F, as is shown by the arrows in FIG. 6, fuel passes along<br>
the gap in the radial direction between the motor housing 6 and the filter member 12, and<br>
passes through the filter member 12. It then arrives at the gap between the filter<br>
member 12 and the pump unit casing 15 and passes through the gap 19 moving towards<br>
the discharge aperture 11. It is then discharged from the discharge aperture 11a. At<br>
this time, dirt and the like is filtered out by the filter member 12 so that the fuel is<br>
discharged as clean fuel.<br>
In this way, because the fuel pump unit 11 of the present embodiment filters fuel<br>
that it discharges, clean fuel can be supplied, for example, to the fuel injection pump in<br>
latter stages.<br>
Because a flow that runs substantially along the axial direction of the motor<br>
rotor 8 is formed between the bottom end side pump side connecting flow path f1 that is<br>
provided in the vicinity of the bearing section 2a inside the motor section M and the top<br>
end side filtration section connecting flow path f2 that is provided in the vicinity of the<br>
commutator 8c, heat and dirt inside the motor section M can be efficiently transported<br>
out.<br>
Either of the flow paths of the fuel that passes through the filter member 12 is<br>
able to pass in the axial direction of the filter member 12, however, while the filter 12 is<br>
comparatively clean, the shortest flow path that flows horizontally from the gap 18 and<br>
passes through the gap 19 is superior. As dirt adheres to the filter member 12 and<br>
blockages appear, the flow path that cuts across the filter member 12 is gradually lowered.<br>
When the entire axial direction is blocked, the filter is at the end of its usable period.<br>
In this manner, in the present embodiment, because the filtration side connecting<br>
flow path f2 is provided at one end section (the top end section) in the axial direction of<br>
the filter member 12, blockages caused by fouling of the filter member 12 progress from<br>
the one end section side and the flow path is detoured corresponding to these blockages.<br>
As a result, although the filter surface area is gradually narrowed, the filter surface<br>
forming the actual flow path is easily able to maintain its cleanness, and compared with<br>
when the entire filter surface is blocked uniformly, the performance such as the discharge<br>
rate and pump load and the like are stable for a considerable length of time.<br>
In the flow path of the present embodiment, the filtration section F and the<br>
motor section M are connected only by the filtration side connecting flow path f2, and<br>
the majority thereof is separated by the motor housing 6 that covers the motor rotor 8.<br>
Therefore, the rotating flow of the fuel created by the motor rotor 8 is violent inside the<br>
motor section M, but extremely gentle inside the filtration section F. As a result, it is<br>
difficult for dirt and the like adhering to the filter member 12 to be affected by the<br>
rotation of the motor rotor 8. Namely, compared with when the rotor is rotating in the<br>
vicinity of the filter, it is extremely rare for dirt from the filter member 12 to become<br>
detached and float freely in the fuel. Accordingly, there is no reverse flow of dirt to the<br>
motor section M.<br>
Even if dirt that is not able to become adhered to the filter member 12<br>
temporarily increases, compared with the length in the axial direction of the filtration<br>
section F, its width is extremely narrow. Therefore, the dirt has to return through the<br>
filtration side connecting flow path f2 via the gap 18 that is placed further to the one end<br>
side of the filtration section F. Therefore, it is difficult for the dirt to reverse flow into<br>
the motor section M.<br>
Accordingly, because the interior of the motor section M is kept comparatively<br>
clean, it is possible to reduce faults such as dirt becoming blocked in the bearing gaps of<br>
the bearing sections 2a and 9a, and to thereby improve reliability.<br>
The fuel pump unit 1 is typically used in a placement attitude such as that in the<br>
above explanation. In this case, because dirt inside the filtration section F is<br>
precipitated out by its own weight, reverse flow becomes even more difficult.<br>
In the present embodiment, a pump section P is provided that has an impeller 5<br>
in which blades 5a are provided to cover a diameter that is larger than the outer diameter<br>
of the motor section M, and the outer circumferential section of the pump section P and<br>
the inner section of the motor section M are connected by the pump side connecting flow<br>
path f1. Therefore, even at a comparatively low rotation speed, it is possible to raise the<br>
circumferential speed of the impeller 5 and raise the pump pressure, and to thereby make<br>
the structure of the motor section M smaller. It is also possible to reduce the noise when<br>
the pump is in operation.<br>
Because the filtration section F is placed above the pump section P that<br>
protrudes to the outer side of the motor section M, space inside the columnar shaped<br>
interior can be utilized effectively and a compact structure can be achieved.<br>
The pump side connecting flow path fl arrives at the motor section M via the<br>
fuel guide groove 2f that forms a horizontally bent flow path from the fuel guide hole 2g<br>
that extends vertically upward. Accordingly, even if dirt inside the motor section M<br>
falls due to its own gravity, it falls onto the exit aperture of the fuel guide groove 2f.<br>
The force that propels the dirt in a horizontal direction along the fuel guide groove 2f<br>
does not work from the motor section M side, but, in contrast, highly pressured fuel is<br>
pressure fed from the pump section P side. Therefore, the dirt does not return to the<br>
blades 5a. Accordingly, even if the pump section P is placed vertically underneath, it is<br>
still possible to prevent dirt from reverse flowing to the blades 5a and damaging the<br>
pump section P. Thus an improvement in reliability is achieved.<br>
Next, a modified example of the present embodiment will be described briefly.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic cross-sectional view in an axial direction for describing<br>
showing the fuel pump unit 50 according to a modified example of the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
The fuel pump unit 50 of this modified example uses a commutator 80c instead<br>
of the commutator 8c of the fuel pump unit 1, and consequently uses a brush holder 22<br>
and an outlet cover 23 instead of the brush holder 9 and the outlet cover 11. In addition,<br>
a bottom sealing member 20 and a top sealing member 21, which form the modified<br>
example, are used instead of the bottom sealing member 13 and top sealing member 14.<br>
The remainder of the structure is the same as the sections described above. Only those<br>
sections that are different from those above are described below.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 8, the commutator 80c is a type of commutator that abuts<br>
against the brush 10 in the axial direction. Therefore, the brush holder 22 has a<br>
configuration that allows it to hold the brush 10 in the axial direction.<br>
FIG. 9A is a top explanatory view for describing the brush holder 22. FIG. 9B<br>
is a cross-sectional view taken along the line L-L in FIG. 9A. FIG. 9C is a rear<br>
explanatory view. FIG. 9D is a cross-sectional view taken along the line N-N in FIG.<br>
9A.<br>
The brush holder 22 is provided with a cylindrically shaped fitting section 22e<br>
that fits in an inner circumferential section of the motor housing 6 at a bottom side of a<br>
circular top surface section 22h. Respective inner surfaces thereof form a commutator<br>
housing section 22b which is a concave hole capable of providing a gap to store the<br>
commutator 80c. A flange section 22c for providing an anchor with the end section of<br>
the motor housing 6 is provided in the central section in the axial direction of the fitting<br>
section 22e.<br>
Brush fixing sections 22f that are formed by through holes running in the axial<br>
direction are provided in two locations on an upper side of the top surface section 22h.<br>
A bearing section 22a that supports a motor shaft 8a is provided in a center section of the<br>
top surface section 22h. In the bearing section 22a, a shaft pressing member is<br>
constructed on a top end section thereof so as to extend across in the radial direction.<br>
On the left and right sides in the radial direction, a half moon shaped gap is provided.<br>
As a result, a half moon-shaped through hole is formed that allows a shaft end section of<br>
the motor shaft 8a to be viewed during assembly. A wiring anchor section 22g that<br>
anchors electrical wiring of the brush is provided on a top surface section 22h at a side of<br>
the bearing section 22a.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 9D, a through hole 22d that is notched in the top surface<br>
section 22h and in the upper side section of the flange section 22c is provided at a section<br>
of an outer circumferential section of the top surface section 22h.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 8, the fitting section 22e is fitted into the top end section of<br>
the motor housing 6, and is anchored to an end section in the axial direction of the motor<br>
housing 6 by the flange section 22e so as to cover the top section of the motor section M.<br>
A brush 10 is inserted from above into the brush fixing section 22f.<br>
The outlet cover 23 is a cap member that is provided with a discharge aperture<br>
11 a on a top surface side thereof in the same way as the outlet cover 11. It is also<br>
provided with an outer circumferential wall in the same way and is fixed to the pump unit<br>
casing 15.<br>
FIGS. 10A, 10B, and 10C are a rear explanatory view, a cross-sectional view<br>
taken along the line Q-Q, and a top explanatory view showing an outlet cover 23<br>
according to this modified example.<br>
A brush guide housing section 23e that provides a gap to house a top surface<br>
side of the brush holder 22 is formed by the circular cylinder wall-shaped partition wall<br>
23d that forms the outer circumferential groove 11c. A brush pressing section 23h<br>
formed by a cylindrical conduit that is used for inserting a pressing spring 25 in the axial<br>
direction so as to correspond to the placement position of the brush 10 is mounted on a<br>
top surface of the brush guide housing section 23e.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 8, the pressing springs 25 are provided in order to press the<br>
brush 10 against the commutator 80c at a predetermined pressure, and are compressed<br>
downwards by spring pressing members 26 that are inserted from above the brush<br>
pressing section 23h. The aperture of the brush pressing section 23h is sealed by the<br>
spring pressing members 26, and the only aperture in the top surface of the outlet cover<br>
23 is the discharge aperture 11a.<br>
The brush holder 22 is urged from the outlet cover 23 in the axial direction by<br>
the pressing force of the pressing spring 25, so that a gap extending in the radial direction<br>
and the circumferential direction is provided between the top surface of the brush holder<br>
22 and the inner surface of the brush guide housing section 23e.<br>
FIG. 11 is a schematic explanatory view looking in the direction K in FIG. 8.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 11, fuel flows through this gap from the through hole 22d, and a<br>
filtration side connecting flow path f2 is formed from the gap 18 to the filtration section<br>
F.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 8, the bottom sealing member 20 and the top sealing<br>
member 21 are examples of metal plate members formed by rings whose cross section in<br>
the axial direction is substantially U shaped. According to this type of configuration,<br>
they can be formed as lightweight and low cost members. When the bottom sealing<br>
member 20 is mounted to the bottom section of the toroidal chamber, because it is<br>
possible to assemble the bottom sealing member 20 in the toroidal chamber by press<br>
insertion utilizing the springiness of the side surfaces of the U shape, the ease of<br>
assembly is improved.<br>
In this modified example, the brush holder 22 is pressed via the pressing spring<br>
25, however, because the pressing direction is an axial direction, no failures such as the<br>
bearing section 22a deforming occur. The filtration side connecting flow path f2 has a<br>
working effect in the same way as the fuel pump unit 1, however, in this modified<br>
example, in particular, because the through hole 22d is provided at substantially the same<br>
height as the brushing contact section of the brushes 10, dirt generated by the brushing<br>
contact of the brushes is scattered in a horizontal direction by centrifugal force, and in<br>
that state is reliably carried away via the through hole 22d, so that the cleanliness of the<br>
motor section M is further improved.<br>
In the above explanation, a description is given of when the respective gaps<br>
between the outlet covers and the cap members are continuous in the radial direction and<br>
circumferential direction, however, in order to form a flow of fuel to the bearing, it is<br>
sufficient if the filtration side connecting flow path is continuous in the radial direction<br>
extending over the bearing section.<br>
In the above explanation, examples are given of when the outlet cover and the<br>
cap member are not in contact with each other, and of when they are in contact via a<br>
spring. However, the outlet cover and the cap member may be allowed to come into<br>
contact due to pressure variations inside the pump housing provided that the bearing<br>
section and the like that are provided in the cap member are not deformed above a<br>
permissible value.<br>
For example, if the outlet cover is formed by a material having a low rigidity,<br>
then it is possible to provide protrusions and partition walls and the like in order to secure<br>
a gap from the cap member so as to prevent unevenness in the gap caused by bending<br>
and the like of the component. In this state, if the bearing section does not cause<br>
excessive deformation, then when the pump is being operated, the outlet cover receives<br>
pressure internally and expands. Consequently, it deforms so as to move away from the<br>
protrusions and partition walls and enlarge the gap, and the bearing deformation does not<br>
increase any more than that.<br>
In the above explanation, an example is given of when the filtration section is<br>
inbuilt, however, it is not essential for the filtration section to be built in the toroidal<br>
chamber if the reason for this is to prevent the bearing section of the motor section from<br>
being deformed.<br>
In the above explanation, an example is given of when a through hole is<br>
provided in the cap member in order to equalize the internal pressures of the motor<br>
section and the toroidal chamber and the fuel is allowed to circulate more freely above<br>
the bearing section, however, a through hole may also be provided in the motor housing<br>
in the vicinity of the cap member.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention provides a fuel pump unit that is extremely easy to<br>
assemble, and that provides improved reliability without the motor section being<br>
deformed by internal pressure.<br>
Because no deformation of the motor section occurs during the mounting thereof<br>
and the bearing section gap can be properly maintained, it is possible to prevent bearing<br>
abrasion and improve reliability. Because the motor section and pump housing can be<br>
assembled in separate steps, the ease of assembly is improved. It is possible to hasten<br>
the cooling of the motor housing outer circumferential section and the bearing section,<br>
and the life of the motor section can be extended. It is possible to suppress deformation<br>
of the bearing section provided in the bracket member, and to thereby improve reliability.<br>
Because an inlet cover and outlet cover that require a comparatively complex<br>
configuration starting with the intake aperture and discharge aperture are formed as<br>
separate members, manufacturing is simplified and a low cost apparatus can be<br>
manufactured.<br>
It is possible to transport dirt away in order to maintain the cleanliness and cool<br>
the motor section, so that, reliability is improved. Moreover, a high discharge pressure<br>
can be obtained using a comparatively low revolution speed. The space that overlaps<br>
with the impeller in the radial direction can be utilized effectively, and a compact<br>
apparatus with a built in filtration section can be achieved. It is possible to prevent the<br>
occurrence of breakdowns that are caused by the reverse flow of dirt in the pump section,<br>
and the thereby improve reliability. A small-size, low-cost apparatus can be achieved.<br>
The pump side connecting flow path can be formed simply. Because dirt does not reach<br>
directly above the pump section outer circumferential section in the axial direction, pump<br>
breakdowns can be decreased.<br>
Because dirt such as abrasion powder is transported together with fuel to the<br>
filtration section and is filtered, and clean fuel can be discharged from the discharge<br>
aperture, it is easy to maintain the cleanliness of the motor section and to thereby<br>
improve reliability.<br>
