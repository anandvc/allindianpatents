				<td>The length and attenuation of a signal line between a transmitter and a customer premises equipment is to be estimated. A frequency dependent line input impedance (Zin,(f)), as seen from the transmitter, is measured and an absolute impedance value (æ Zin,(f) æ) is generated.

Extreme values (Max.l, Max2, Max3; Minl, Min2, Min3) are denoted and a frequency distance (FD1- FD4) between two consecutive of the extreme values is generated. The line length (L) is generated as L=1/2 • vop/FD1, in which vop is the velocity of propagation of a signal on the line. The attenuation is estimated by multiplying the line length with an average attenuation value for the actual line type. The advantages are that the line length can be estimated with good accuracy in a simple manner for short lines and that the line attenuation is estimated in a simple manner.</td>

METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR ESTIMATION OF LINE PROPERTIES TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
  The present invention relates to a method and an arrangement in the area of estimation of line properties of a signal<br>
 5   line, such as the line length and line attenuation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In today's telecommunication it is essential from an economical point of view to use existing copper wires for broadband transmission. These copper wires,  often called<br>
10  twisted-pair copper loops or copper access lines, have among themselves very different properties from a broadband point of view. Telecom operators therefore have a great interest in testing the properties of the lines to be able to fully utilize their transmission capacity. The above-mentioned is<br>
15  discussed in an article by Walter Goralski: "xDSL Loop Qualification and Testing", IEEE Communications Magazine, May 1999, pages 79-83. The article also discusses testing possibilities and test equipment.<br>
    The transmission properties of copper lines are more closely <br>
20  discussed in an article by Jose E. Schutt-Aine: "High-Frequency Characterization of Twisted-Pair Cables", IEEE Transactions on Communications,Vol. 49, No. 4, April 2001. Propagation parameters of high bit rate digital subscriber twisted-pair cables are extracted by a wave propagation<br>
25  method model. The frequency dependence in the properties of the transmission line and the influence of the skin effect on these are studied.<br>
    Testing the transmission properties of a line can be performed by sending a test signal from one end of the line <br>
30 and measure it at the other end, so called double end test. That method is labour intensive and expensive. A more frequently used method is to send a test signal from one end<br><br>
WO2004/099711	3	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
   of the line and measure on the reflected signal from the line, so called Single-Ended Loop Testing, SELT. In an article by Stefano Galli and David L Waring: "Loop Makeup Identification Via Single Ended Testing: Beyond Mere Loop <br>
5 Qualification", IEEE- Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. 20, No. 5, June 2002 is discussed the influence of different types of line discontinuities and generated echoes in connection with single-ended testing. Especially time-domain reflectometry, TDR, is discussed for<br>
10  measuring the length of a line. An outgoing pulse is sent to the line and a reflected pulse is detected. Assuming that the velocity of the pulse is known, then by measuring the time between the two pulses the line length can be estimated. One difficulty with the traditional TDR method is<br>
15  that the reflected pulse can be heavily attenuated and be difficult to detect, as it is hidden by the rather broad outgoing pulse. To avoid this problem the pulses can be filtered, but the Galli and Waring article suggests to instead subtract the outgoing pulse to get a distinct<br>
20  reflected pulse. A mathematical method for handling the echoes is presented and also ah experimental validation of the method.<br>
Another problem with the traditional TDR method is that for short lines the outgoing and reflected pulses are close to<br>
25  each other and are difficult to separate of that reason. For a very long line, on the other hand, the reflected pulse is heavily attenuated and can be hidden in the noise. Therefore, in traditional TDR, for some measurements only one pulse is observable and it is impossible to know if it<br>
30   depends on that the line is very short or very long.<br>
     In single-ended testing it is advantageous to use the transceiver as a part of a mesurement device for the loop under test. The broadband communication transceiver is no perfect voltage generator but introduces distortion in the <br>
35   measurement. How to remove this distortion is discussed in a<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	4	PCT/SE 2O04/000718<br>
   standardization paper by Thierry Pollet :"How is G.selt to specify Su (calibrated measurements)?", ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector, Temporary Document OJ-091; Osaka, Japan 21-25 October, 2002. A calibration <br>
5 method is presented, based on a one port scattering parameter Su, that includes transceiver parameters which are generated during a calibration. Also in a standardization paper by Thierry Pollet : "Minimal information to be passed between measurement and interpretation unit", ITU <br>
10 Telecommunication Standardization Sector, Temporary Document OC-049; Ottawa, Canada 5-9 August, 2002, the one port scattering parameter Su is discussed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is concerned with a main problem how 15  to estimate the length of a signal line.<br>
Another problem is how to classify the line as being a long or a short line, prior to the length estimation.<br>
     Still a problem is how to perform the length estimation in a single ended loop test, utilizing a transceiver intended for <br>
20   communication purposes.<br>
A further problem is to estimate a line attenuation.<br>
     The problems are solved by generation of an absolute value of a  frequency dependent line input impedance and utilizing the waveform and periodicity of the absolute value of the<br>
 25  line input impedance.<br>
     More closely the problems are solved by selecting consecutive maxima or consecutive minima of the absolute value of the line input impedance. A frequency distance between two of the consecutive extreme values is determined. <br>
30  With the aid of the signal velocity of propagation on the line  and  the  frequency  distance  the  line  length  is<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	5	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
   estimated. An attenuation value is in one embodiment generated based on the length and an attenuation per length unit for the line. In an alternative embodiment extreme values of the absolute impedance value curve are used to <br>
5   estimate the line attenuation.<br>
A purpose with the invention is to estimate the length d of the signal line in a simple manner.<br>
Another purpose is to classify the line as long or short before the length estimation.<br>
10  Still a purpose is to facilitate the use of a transceiver for communication purposes in the line length estimation.<br>
Still another purpose is to make the" length estimation independent of the hardware in the transceiver.<br>
A further purpose is to estimate a line attenuation.<br>
15 An advantage with the invention is that the line can be decided as short before the length estimation.<br>
Another advantage is that a reliable length value can be estimated for short lines.<br>
Still an advantage is that a transceiver for communication 20  purposes can be calibrated and used for the estimation.<br>
Still another advantage is to make the length estimation independent of the hardware in the transceiver.<br>
A further advantage is that the line attenuation can be generated in a simple manner.<br>
25  The invention " will now be more closely described with the aid of embodiments and with refernce to the enclosed drawings.<br><br>

30  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
In figure 1 is shown a front end device, a measurement device MD1, connected to a customer's remote device 3 via a signal line 2 having a length L. This signal line is a<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	7	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
   copper wire initially used for narrowband signal transmission. A signal on the line 2 propagates with a velocity vop ■ m/s. As mentioned above it is of great interest for telecommunication operators to use such lines <br>
5  for brodband transmission and therefore the properties of the line 2 must be known, such as the line length L. The properties of the line are therefore to be measured, which can be performed by different methods.<br>
10	One such method is shown in figure 1. The measurement device MD1 has a line unit LUl and a calculation unit CUl connected to each other. The measuring device MD1 has a control input/output IU1. The line unit has a frequency broadband   voltage source VS1 with a voltage E and an impedance Zs and <br>
15  also a voltage measurement device VMl measuring a line input voltage Vi. A frequency dependent line input impedance (Zin(f)) for a loop including the line 2 and, the remote device 3 can be calculated by an equation<br><br>
20<br>
The calculation is performed in the calculation unit CUl.<br>
     In the present invention the frequency dependent line input impedance Zin(f)   is used to generate an estimated value of <br>
25   the line length L. It is observed that the impedance Z!n(f)<br>
     is a function that has a part that is periodic with the frequency as is shown in figure 2. This figure is a diagram with the frequency / on the abscissa and an absolute value | Zjn(f) | of the line input impedance on the ordinate. <br>
30  The diagram shows curves over measurements of the absolute value | Zln(f) | of the input impedance Zln(f)    for different<br>
lengths of the signal line 2. The signal line is a cable of certain type and the remote device 3 is in the embodiment a telephone set in the on-hook state. The cable lengths,<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	8	PCT/SE2004/00071h<br>
    denoted in kilometers the diagram, are 0.5 km, 1.0 km and 1.5 km. It appears from the diagram that the period for the respective curve is different for the different cable lengths. <br>
5<br>
In figure 3 is shown an impedance diagram for only one signal line having the length L. The diagram has the frequency /on the abscissa and the absolute value | Z(. (/) I<br>
of the line input impedance on the ordinate. In this diagram<br>
10  is  shown an impedance curve Al which  is  essentially<br>
   periodic and is generated by a number of samples A2 at<br>
mutual frequency distance of A/ . The curve Al has a number<br>
of extreme values of which maximums Maxl, Max2, Max3 and<br>
minimums  Mini,  Min2  ,  Min3  are  shown.  The  frequency<br>
15  distance between two consecutive of the extreme values of<br>
 the  same type is denoted by FD1,  FD2,  FD3 and FD4<br>
    respectively. The line length L can now be estimated by<br>
using the distance FD1 and with the aid of the velocity of<br>
      propagation vop  by an equation:<br>
20       L= H vop/FDl	(2)<br>
This equation can alternatively be expressed as<br><br><br>
     In the equation (3) the expression cycle    is the "cycle<br>
 25  time", i.e. the periodicity, of the input impedance \Zin(f)\ expressed  in  number  of  the  samples  A2  between  two consecutive maximums or minimums of the curve Al.<br>
    The velocity of propagation vop is about 0.7 of the <br>
30  velocity of light in vaccum, i.e vop * 2-108 m/s. In the example in figure 3 the frequency, distance is FD1*200 kHz. The line length can be estimated by the equation 2 to about L=500 m.<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	9	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
  The length estimation of the line 2 can be improved by using more than one of the frequency distances. As mentioned above the curve Al is essentially periodic. It has however been observed that, in some cases depending on <br>
5 the type of termination, the frequency distance FD2 is slightly longer than the distance FD1 and correspondingly the distance FD4 is slightly longer than the distance FD3. For higher frequencies the frequency distances successively grows still a little bit. This fact depends on that, in the<br>
10 actual cases, the velocity of propagation vop increases with increasing frequency. Mean values MV1 and MV2 can be generated for the frequency distance by e.g. the equations<br>
MV1 = (FDl+FD2)/2	(4)<br>
15       MV2 = (FD3+FD4)/2	(5)<br>
The line length L is estimated	as<br>
L = H  vop/MVl	(6)<br>
L = *i vop/MV2	(7)<br>
20  Still an improvement is to use both the maximums and the minimums e.g. by generating a mean frequency distance<br>
MV3 = (MVl+MV2)/2	(8)<br>
25  and estimate the line length as<br>
L = %  vqp/MV3	(9)<br>
   In the above examples the frequency distances between three <br>
30 maximums or minimums have been used. In an obvious way it is possible to use still further of the extreme values of the curve Al to generate the length estimate L of the line 2. The type of averaging depends on the type of termination of the line, i.e. the type of the remote device 3. If the<br>
35 termination is known in a certain case it is possible to choose the most appropriate averaging.<br><br>
WO 2004/099711		PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
10<br>
As appears from figure 2 the amplitude oscillation in the signal |Z^,(/)| is larger for a short than for a long loop.<br>
     This means that the estimated length value L will be less <br>
5   exact for a long loop. It is therefore of interest to estimate if a loop can be regarded as short. Below is disclosed how the input impedance, Zin(f), can be used for this purpose, short loop detection. The basic principle is to calculate a decision value dValue and compare it with a<br>
10   threshold value thValue, which threshold value should cover realistic telecommunication cables. The threshold value depends on the different attenuation for the different types of cables. A decision value can be calculated as follows:<br>
15       	<br><br>
where /,and /2 are design parameters that represent the<br>
lowest and highest frequency to consider. The mValue  is a mean value of the curve Al in the actual frequency range.<br><br>
20 The dValue corresponds to an energy value for the fluctuations of the curve Al in the actual frequency range. If the dValue ^.thValue the loop should be considered as short. The value thValae is a design parameter that sets the limit for when a loop shall be considered short.<br><br>
25<br>
30<br><br>
The decision of short loop length and generation of the length for the signal line 2 as described above will be described in concentrate in connection with a flow chart in figure 4.<br>
In a first step 401 the line input impedance 2T,„(/) is generated. The absolute value    of the line input<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
11<br>
 impedance is generated in a step 402. In a step 403 the mean value mValue according to equation (10) is generated and in a step 404 the decision value dValue according to equation (11) is generated. The threshold value thValue is<br>
 5  decided in a step 405 for the actual telecommunication cable type in the line 2. The decision is based on the attenuation for the cable type. In a step 406 it is investigated if the decision value is bigger than the threshold value. In an alternative NO the procedure is<br>
10 stopped in a step 407. In an opposite alternative YES the procedure goes on in a step 408 with the selection of extreme values of the curve Al for the absolute values of the line input impedance. The frequency distance is generated, alternatively as a mean value of a number of<br>
15  frequency distance values, see equations (4), (5) or (8). In a step 410 the line length value L is generated, see equations (6), (7) or (9).<br>
     In the description above the line input impedance Z!n(f) for <br>
20  the line 2 is measured via the measurement device MD1. It is an advantage for a telecom operator if a conventional transceiver for communication purposes can be used instead of a special measurement device such as the device MDl. Below will be described how such a transceiver can be <br>
25   calibrated and used for the measurement of the line input impedance Z!n(f)   in a single-ended loop test SELT.<br>
In figure 5 is shown a front end device, in this case a transceiver 1, connected to the remote device 3 via the<br>
30 signal line 2. The transceiver is suitable for communication purposes and is described such that the SELT measurement can be explained. The transceiver 1 includes a digital part 41, a codec 42 and an analog part 43, the so called Analog Front End AFE. The digital part includes in<br>
35  turn a digital signal generator 13 and a computational<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
   device 11 interconnected with a memory device 12. The transceiver 1 also has an input 63 and an output 64. The generator, which is connected to the computational device 11, sends a broadband input loop test signal vin to the <br>
5  remote device 3 via the codec 42, the analog part 43 and the line 2. A reflected broadband loop test signal vout is received in the computational device from the line 2 via the analog part and the codec.<br>
    The broadband loop test signal vin, sent for such measuring <br>
10  purposes, is reflected back over the line 2 and is noted as the loop test signal vout- As will be described below, the signals Vin and vout are used in the determining of the properties of the line 2.<br>
    What the operator in fact needs to know is the input <br>
15 impedance Z!n(f) of the line 2 including the remote device 3, measured from a transceiver interface 5 and being independent of the transceiver 1 itself. A first step in getting the required line properties is to generate an echo<br>
   transfer function Heell0(f) for the actual line 2. This is <br>
20 calculated by performing a frequency translation of the broadband signals vin and vout, resulting in signals Vin{/) and Vout (j0 in the frequency domain. The transfer function is generated by the relationship<br>
Hech0(f)=  Vout(/)/Vin(/)	(12)<br>
25  in which the frequency is denoted by /.<br>
Naturally, the function Heclm{f)   includes properties of the<br>
    transceiver 1. Below it will be described by an example how the required line properties of the line 2 can be obtained with the aid of the frequency dependent echo transfer <br>
30  function Hecho(f) . First, the transceiver analog part 43 will be described somewhat more in detail in connection with<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	13	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
figure 6. This is to throw light upon the difficulties in characterizing the transceiver 1 in a simple manner.<br>
    Figure 6 is a simplified block diagram over the analog <br>
5  transceiver part 43 and the line 2 of figure 5, yet somewhat more detailed than in that figure. The analog part 43 includes an amplifier block 6, a hybrid block 7, a sense resistor RS and a line transformer 8. The amplifier block 6 has a driver 61 with its input connected to the digital<br>
10  generator 13 via the codec 42, not shown. I also has a receiver 62 receiving signals from the line 2 and having its output connected to the transceiver digital part 41, not shown. The driver output is connected to the sense resistor RS, the terminals of which are connected to the<br>
15  hybrid block 7. The latter has four resistors Rl, R2, R3 and R4 and is connected to inputs of the receiver 62. The line transformer 8 has a primary winding LI and two secondary windings L2 and L3 interconnected by a capacitor CI.  The primary winding LI is connected to the sense<br>
20  resistor RS and the secondary windings L2 and L3 are connected to the line 2. The frequency dependent line input impedance at the interface 5 is demoted Zin(f)   and the input<br>
     impedance at the primary side of the transformer is denoted       ZL. The termination of the far-end of the line 2, the <br>
25  remote device 3, is represented by an impedance ZA.<br>
The signal Vin, now in analog form from the codec 42, is amplified in the driver block 61. The output impedance of the driver is synthezised by the feedback loop from the<br>
30  sense resistor RS. The line transformer 8 has a voltage step-up from the driver to the loop. The capacitor CI has. a DC-blocking function. The transformer and the capacitor act as a high pass filter between the driver 61/receiver 62 and the loop 2, 3 with a cut-off .frequency around 30 kHz. No<br>
35  galvanic access to the loop is possible in this case.<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	14	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
  In the present description a frequency-domain model of the echo transfer function #„,,„(/) is used to calculate the frequency dependent input impedance Zln(f) of the loop 2 and 3, as seen by the transceiver 1 at the interface 5. The <br>
5 input impedance can then be used for calculating several loop qualification parameters. This frequency-domain model of the echo transfer function Hecho(f) includes three parameters ZhQ(f), Z^f) anc* •#»(/) which relate to the transceiver 1. The parameters, transceiver model values,<br>
 10  fully describe the transceiver from this point of view.<br>
The parameters Zh0(f),     Z/#(/)  and H(f)     are originally<br>
    deduced analytically from the circuits of the transceiver. Some minor simplifications have been made in the analysis, <br>
15  but the model has proved to be very accurate.<br>
    The values of the parameters are normally not calculated directly from the component values of the transceiver, but are generated from measurements in a calibration process, <br>
20  as will be described below.<br>
    In the earlier mentioned standardization paper "How is G.selt to specify Sn (calibrated measurements)?" the scattering parameter Sn is expressed with three parameters <br>
25  CI, C2 and C3 for the transceiver., These parameters should not be confused with the transceiver model values Zh0(f), Z,vb(f)   and H„(f)   of the present description. The parameters<br>
    CI, C2 and C3 are dimensionless quantities and are not given any concrete meaning, although they are successfully <br>
30  used to model the transceiver. The transceiver model values of the present description are recognized in the analysis and can be interpreted directly:<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	15	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
    The value Ha(f)   is the frequency dependent echo transfer function for the transceiver 1 with open connection to the line 2, i.e.  when the line impedance is of unlimited magnitude. <br>
5<br>
The value Zhyb{f)   is the transceiver impedance as measured at<br>
the  connections to the line 2,     i.e.  the transceiver impedance at the interface 5 as seen from the line side.<br>
The value Zh0(f)   can be expressed as Zh0(f)   =  H0(f)-   Z^if),<br>
10  in which the value Ho(f)	is the frequency dependent echo<br>
transfer  function  for	the  transceiver  1  with  the<br>
connections to the line 2	shortcut and the value Zhb(f)   is<br>
defined above.<br>
15  It is to observe that the transceiver model values are not measured directly, but are generated in a process as will be described below.<br>
The echo transfer function Hech0(f)   of equation (1) can be<br>
 20   expressed as:<br>
"'-)~   z„(/)+zw(/)	,13)<br>
in which<br>
                  Zrn(f)   is tne earlier mentioned input impedance of the line 2 as a function of the frequency / / and <br>
25  Zh0(f),   Zhyb(f)  and Hn(f)   are complex vectors and are the transceiver model values mentioned above.<br>
    After a calibration measurement of a certain transceiver version its vectors can be determined. These vectors, the <br>
30  transceiver model values, are then pre-stored in for example the software of the transceivers of the measured version, e.g. in the memory 12 of the transceiver 1. The<br><br>
WO 2004/099711                                                               16                                          PCT/SE2004/000718<br><br>
model values are then used for the loop test of the line 2 with its initially unknown properties.<br>
   In connection with figure 7 will be mentioned how the <br>
5  calibration measurement is performed. The figure shows a test transceiver 31, to which test impedances 9 of different predetermined values are connected at the interface 5 for the line 2. A measurement device 32 with a memory 33 is connected to the input 63 and the otput 64 of<br>
10  the test transceiver. The measurement device 32 sends a control signal VC1 to the test transceiver 31 and initiates it to generate a broadband transceiver test signal vtin , one for each value of the test impedance 9. A reflected output transceiver test signal vtout is received in the test<br>
15 tranceiver, which sends a corresponding control signal VC2 to the measurement device. A complete measurement requires the measurement of three selected impedance values. The<br>
echo  transfer  function Hech0(f)     is  then  generated  in<br>
accordance with the relationship (12).<br>
20<br>
Using three impedance values for the calibration is sufficient to generate the transceiver values. To get more precise values, more than the three impedances can be used. This gives rise to an overdetermined equation system. An<br>
25  example on a set of standard values of the test impedance 9 for the calibration is an open circuit, a shortcut circuit and an impedance value corresponding to an expected value for the loop, e.g. 100 ohms. It should be noted that a value for a purely resistive component is normally valid<br>
30  only up to a limited frequency, e.g. 1 MHz. For higher frequencies it is recommended to measure the impedance value of the "resistive" component.<br>
The generation of the three complex vectors Z/l0(/), Zhyb(f)<br>
 35   and Ha(f)      for the measured transceiver 31 is performed in<br><br>
WO 2004/099711                                                              17                                        PCT/SE2004/000718<br><br>
the  following manner.  The model of the echo transfer function in the relationship (13) can be expressed as:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The general solution to the system Ax=b   is<br>
x = (ATA)ATb<br>
By using the values of the transfer function HechB(f),<br>
10  measured as described above with, different types of the input terminations 9, the vector x can be solved. The thus generated calibration values of the vector x are stored for example in the memory 33 of the measurement device 32 or in the memory 12 of the transceivers of the measured version.<br>
15 Note that A, x and b normally are complex valued and frequency dependent.<br><br>
20<br>
25<br><br>
After a measurement of the echo transfer function Hecho(f)<br>
for the actual unknown line 2, its input impedance as seen by the transceiver 1 at the interface 5 can be generated as:<br><br><br><br>
To summarize, a certain hardware for transceivers like the transceiver 1 is first calibrated. This is performed for the test transceiver 31 with the aid of the impedances 9 and the transceiver test signals vtin and vtout. The vector x is calculated and the values of the vector x are stored and can be used for any transceiver with the same hardware. The echo transfer function Hecll0(f)    is then measured by the<br><br>
W0 2f)(M/()99711	18	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
    transceiver 1 for the line 2 having unknown properties with the aid of the loop test signals vin and vout. The frequency dependent input impedance Zin(f)   of the line 2, as seen from the transceiver interface 5, is then generated. <br>
5<br>
In the embodiment described above, both the transceiver test signals vtin,vtout and the loop test signals vin,vout have been broadband signals. It is possible to use signals of any desired frequency width both for the calibration and<br>
10  the measurement of the line. The calibration and the loop test will of course be valid only for the selected frequency range. It has been mentioned that the transceiver model values are stored in the memory 12 of the transceiver 1. An obvious alternative is to store the values in the<br>
15  memory 33 or in a memory in some central computer and transmit them to the transceiver 1 when they are required for the generation of e.g. the input impedance Zin(f)   of the<br>
    line 2. Also, in the description has been mentioned the test transceiver 31 and the transceiver 1 for communication <br>
20  purposes. The test transceiver 31 can be any of a set of transceivers which are based on one and the same hardware. The test transceiver can in an obvious way be used for the communication purposes.<br>
25  The above generation of transceiver model values and the generation of the impedance value for the line 2 will be shortly described in connection with flowcharts in figures 8 and 9.<br>
30 In figure 8 is shown the generation and storage of the transceiver model values. The method begins in a step 601 with the selection of the transceiver 31 for test purposes. In a step 602 an impedance 9 with a predetermined value is selected and in a step 603 the impedance is connected to<br>
35  the line connection of the test transceiver 31. In a step<br><br>
WO 2004/099711	19	PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
   604 the transceiver test signal vtin is sent through the transceiver 31 to the line 2. To get transceiver model values that can be used for a wide range of applications the test signal is a broadband signal. The signal is <br>
5  reflected by the remote device 3 and after passage of the transceiver 31 it is received as the transceiver test signal vtout in a step 605. In a step 606 the echo transfer function Hccho(f) is generated in the computational device 32 for the actual impedance 9, after first having transformed<br>
10  the signals vtin and vtout into the frequency domain. In a step 607 it is investigated whether measurements for a sufficient number of the impedances 9 have been made, so<br>
that the transceiver model values ZM(f),    Z^f)   and Hm(f)<br>
can be generated. In an alternative NOl a further impedance 15   9 is selected in the step 602. For an alternative YES1 the<br>
transceiver model  values  Z/)0(/), Zhyb(f)     and Hn(f)     are<br>
generated in a step 608. In a step 609 the vector x,   i.e.<br>
the transceiver model values, are stored in the memory 33.<br>
Next,  the  transceiver 1  for communication purposes is<br>
20  selected in a step 610. In a step 611 the transceiver model<br>
values Zh0(f),     Zhvb(f)    and Hn(f)     are transmitted to the selected transceiver 1 and are stored in the memory 12.<br>
     Figure 9 shows the generation of the frequency dependent<br>
 25  line input impedance Z/n(/) at the transceiver interface 5 to the line 2. In a step 701 the transceiver 1 for communication purposes is connected to the line 2 with the remote device 3. The loop test signal vin is sent in a step 702. The loop test signal vout as reflected by the line 2 is<br>
 30  received by the transceiver and is measured in a step 703. In a step 704 the frequency dependent echo transfer function HedlB{f) is generated in the computational device 11. The frequency dependent impedance value Zin(f) for the line 2 is generated in the device 11 with the aid of the<br><br><br>
WO 2004/099711		PCT/SE2004/000718<br>
20<br>
stored transceiver model values and the echo transfer function, step 705. This generating is performed in accordance with the relationship (15).<br>
5  An essential property of the signal line 2 is its signal attenuation. For lines that can be regarded as short this attenuation can be estimated in a simple manner with sufficient accuracy. A requirement for this is that the length L of the line is estimated with good accuracy, e.g.<br>
10 as described above. The method will be described in connection with a flow chart in figure 10. In a first step 101 an average attenuation value AAl is calculated for a selected set of normally used telecommunication cables. An example  on  such  an  average  value  is  AA1=11  dB  per<br>
15  kilometer. The line length L of the actual short line is estimated with good accuracy in a step 102. In a step 103 a line attenuation value LAI is generated by multiplying the line length L with the average attenuation value AAl. In an embodiment,  with reference to figure 1,  the method is<br>
20  performed by writing the average attenuation value AAl via the control input/output IUl and storing it in the calculation unit CUl. The line input impedance Zjn(f)    is<br>
     calculated in accordance with equation (1) and the line length is estimated by calculations in the calculating unit <br>
25  CUl.  In  the  same  unit  the  line  attenuation  LAI  is generated.<br>
Another possibility to estimate  a value  on  the  line<br>
attenuation would be to use the ratio between a minimum and<br>
30   an adjacent maximum value of the magnitude of the absolute<br>
impedance value |Z,„(/)|, the curve Al in figure 3. The<br>
estimation is performed using an equation:<br><br>
WO 2004/099711                                                                       21                                        PCT/SE2004/000718<br><br><br>
As an example the minimum value Mini and the adjacent maximum value Maxl are used, which gives:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
5<br>
10<br><br><br><br>
The value loss is the insertion loss value that the line 2 gives rise to when inserted between the transceiver 1 and the remote device 3 in figure 5.<br><br>

Abstract<br>
The length and attenuation of a signal line between a transmitter and a customer premises equipment is to be estimated. A frequency dependent line input impedance (Zin,(f) ), as seen from the transmitter, is measured and an absolute impedance value (a Zin,(0 a) is generated. The latter is shown as a curve (Al) in the diagram with the frequency (/) on the abscissa and the impedance (a Zjn,(/) a) on the ordinate. Extreme values (Max.l, Max2, Max3; Mini, Min2, Min3) are denoted and a frequency distance (FD1-FD4) between two consecutive of the extreme values is generated. The line length (L) is generated as L=l/2*vop/FDl, in which vop is the velocity of propagation of a signal on the line. The attenuation is estimated by multiplying the line length with an average attenuation value for the actual line type. The advantages are that the line length can be estimated with good accuracy in a simple manner for short lines and that the line attenuation is estimated in a simple manner.<br></td>
