The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
598/MUMNP/2004<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
24/9/2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to the coupling of bars, wires and cables, in particular but not exclusively, to the coupling of reinforcing bars used in structural concrete.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
There exists within the art apparatus and method for coupling reinforcing bars used in structural concrete, such coupling commonly involves the use of a tubular steel coupling body or sleeve configured to receive end portions of the reinforcing bars. Typically, the bars are held in place using a number of engaging bolts which engage into the surfaces of the bars wedging them against an inner surface of the tubular body thereby providing a couple.<br>
In particular, US 5,046,878, GB 2220241 and EP 0554972 all disclose a reinforcing bar coupling system as detailed with reference to Figure 1 herein. Figure 1 herein illustrates a cross-sectional side elevation view of a bar coupling system found in the art comprising an elongate tubular body 102, a plurality of engagers 103, at least one gripping surface 104 and an inner surface 105. According to the prior art coupling device 100, elongate tubular body 102 receives reinforcing bar end portions 101 such that engagers 103 are adjustably positioned through the tubular body 102 and serve to wedge bars 101 against gripping surface 104, gripping surface 104 being wedged, in turn, against inner surface 105, thereby forming a couple.<br>
According to EP 0554972 and with reference to Figure 3 therein, the gripping surfaces may be formed as adjustably placed fibs extending the length of the tubular body, these ribs being provided with profiles so as to key into both the inner surface of the tubular body and the reinforcing bars. According to an alternative embodiment and with reference to EP 0554972 and Figure 6 therein,<br>
P1332.specasamended<br><br><br>
the ribs may be formed integrally with the tubular body and project outwardly from the tubular body inner surface towards the center of the coupling device. According to both embodiments the reinforcing bars are configured to sit on top of the ribs so as to be positioned away from the inner surface of the tubular body.<br>
US 5,664,902, US 5,909,980 and US 6,202,282 disclose an elongate tubular body configured for receiving end portions of reinforcing bars in a similar manner to that described above with reference to Figure 1 herein and associated prior art. In particular, these latter prior art documents are not concerned with the provision of a gripping surface configured to engage into the reinforcing bars using a plurality of teeth, instead the tubular body is provided with a non-cylindrical inner surface such that the reinforcing bars, following engagement by the engaging bolts are wedged against a portion of the inner surface as detailed with reference to US 6;202;282~ and Figures 3, 4 and 12 therein. Through the provision of a non-cylindrical inner surface, the reinforcing bars are seated and wedged against discreet regions of the inner surface of the tubular body.<br>
As such, all prior art documents identified above teach of a coupling device being configured to wedge the reinforcing bars against at least one inner surface of the tubular body, the surface(s) being flat or convex with respect to an outer radial surface of the reinforcing bars. Accordingly, the inventors have identified numerous disadvantages associated with such coupling devices found in the art and identified above, these include:<br>
• A common problem encountered with prior art coupling devices utilizing non-integrally formed ribs extending the length of the tubular body as illustrated above, is substantial bar slip in response to an applied tensile load. Bar slippage within the coupler body is a result of poor or minimal reinforcing bar - coupler contact. In particular, where the ribs are used as a gripping surface, the bars are susceptible to slip as a result of firstly, points of contact between the adjustably placed ribs and the coupler<br><br><br>
body and secondly, points of contact between the adjustably placed ribs and the reinforcing bars.<br>
•	The utilization of gripping ribs, in the form of insertable ribs, within the tubular body necessitates a substantial amount of care be taken when assembling the coupling joint so as to ensure the ribs are not displaced from their mountings (light weld) on the inner surface of the tubular body. The displacement of a rib, within the tubular body, may result from contact between an end portion of a reinforcing bar and the rib at a region where the bar is introduced into the coupler body. If rib displacement does occur then either, the joint needs reassembling or if undetected, the joint is weakened yet further due to the incorrect alignment of the rib(s).<br>
•	A profiled gripping surface, typically comprising teeth, which is located away from the tubular body inner surface and towards the center of the coupling device requires elaborate manufacture, or assembly in that either sophisticated tooling is required to form the tubular body having integrally formed ribs which project away from the inner surface or non-integrally formed ribs which are added after the formation of the tubular body. In the case where non-integrally formed ribs are provided it is common to observe incorrect positioning of the ribs within the tubular body resulting ultimately in poor rib - reinforcing bar contact, and a corresponding weak joint.<br>
•	Through the utilization of a flat or convex gripping surface with respect to the radial outer surface of the reinforcing bars, minimal contact is achieved between the coupling device and the reinforcing bars resulting in reduced loading force transfer from the reinforcing bars to the coupling device. Additionally, the absence of teeth on the gripping surface(s), being in reduced contact with the reinforcing bars, does not provide for a strong couple.<br><br>
• As a consequence of this poor reinforcing bar - coupler interaction, at the gripping surface(s), penetration of the bars by the engagers is required so as to increase this interaction. This in turn creates additional disadvantages in that due to the penetration of the engagers into the reinforcing bars, breaking of the bars is experienced within the coupler body in response to a sufficiently high loading force applied laterally to the reinforcing bars.<br>
The present invention endeavors to address and overcome the above identified disadvantages by providing a coupling device as detailed herein below.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the inventors provide a coupling device for coupling reinforcing bars, wires and cables, providing an increased interaction between the reinforcing bars and the coupling device via at least one recessed gripping surface positioned on the inner surface of an elongate tubular body configured for receiving end portions of reinforcing bars. The provision of the recessed gripping surface comprising a plurality of teeth allows the reinforcing bars to be seated correctly within the tubular body thus maximizing contact and interaction between the reinforcing bars and the coupling device. The provision of at least one recessed gripping surface being formed on the inner surface of the elongate tubular body allows for both reliably strong and efficient coupling of reinforcing bars. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a reinforcing bar coupler configured to join the reinforcing bars (rebars) with no weakness in the joint, i.e. the joint is stronger than the bars being joined. According to a specific implementation of the present invention a joint is provided where the joined bars when put under a tensile load, break in a region outside the coupler joint In addition, and in response to an applied tensile load, the joint does not slip by any substantial amount.<br>
The provision of at least one recessed gripping surface being formed integrally with the elongate tubular body minimizes the manufacturing cost and<br><br><br>
eliminates problems encounter with in situ coupling assembly identified above with regard to non integrally formed ribs, providing instead more robust on-site handling.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a coupling device for coupling reinforcing bars used in structural concrete comprising:<br>
an elongate tubular body for receiving end portions of said reinforcing bars;<br>
at least one face extending longitudinally on an inner surface of said tubular body;<br>
a plurality of engagers being adjustably positioned through said tubular body;<br>
said coupling device further comprising and being characterized by:<br>
at least one recessed gripping surface being formed on said at least one face and extending longitudinally on said at least one face and;<br>
a plurality of teeth being formed on said at least one recessed gripping surface, said teeth being configured to engage said reinforcing bars;<br>
wherein said at least one recessed gripping surface is configured to grip said reinforcing bars in response to an engaging of said reinforcing bars by said plurality of engagers.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a coupling device comprising a pentagonal cross-sectional configuration having five longitudinally extending faces. Two gripping surfaces may be formed on two of these faces being in a substantially opposed region of the elongate tubular body<br><br>
relative to the plurality of engagers. Accordingly, the reinforcing bars are configured to partially sit within the two recessed gripping surfaces maintaining an extended contact with the gripping surfaces and accordingly the coupling device. Due to the secured positioning of the reinforcing bars within the tubular body, the engagers can be positively adjusted through the tubular body and into/onto the reinforcing bars thereby forming a strong couple being configured to prevent bar slippage at the joint.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the present invention there is provided a coupling device comprising a substantially circular cross-sectional configuration wherein the inner surface comprises a single longitudinally extending face having at least one recessed gripping surface positioned in a substantially opposed region of the elongate tubular body relative to the plurality of engagers. According to this second embodiment the reinforcing bars are configured to seat correctly within the coupling device without resort to manually adjusting placement of the reinforcing bars within the coupling device. The engagers can then be positively adjusted through the tubular body and into/onto the reinforcing bars whereby extended contact is made between the reinforcing bars and the elongate tubular body, the coupling device thereby forming a strong couple.<br>
According to further specific implementation of the present invention a strong couple/joint is achieved and maintained through the utilization of a tubular body having any geometrical cross-sectional configuration where at least one recessed gripping surface is formed on at least one face of the inner surface.<br>
According to specific implementations of the present invention a coupling device is provided having a reduced length and diameter to that found in the art. Additionally, a coupling device is provided, as described herein, being configured to engage the reinforcing bars at the gripping surface(s) such that the core surface of the reinforcing bars (the surface not including the ribs formed on the reinforcing bars) is not engaged by the gripping surface(s), the gripping of the<br><br>
bars by the gripping surface(s) being provided by contact with the ribs of the reinforcing bar. According to specific implementations of the present invention at least one recessed gripping surface may comprise a radius of curvature being substantially equal to a radius of curvature of the core surface of the reinforcing bars at a cross section of the reinforcing bars or a radius of curvature of the reinforcing bars including the bar ribs at a cross section along the length of the bars.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention the gripping surface(s) may comprise a radius of curvature extending perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the elongate tubular body, where the radius of curvature may be equal to a radius of curvature of an outer surface of the reinforcing bars at a cross-section of the reinforcing bars. As such, contact between the gripping surface(s) and the reinforcing bars, and the corresponding gripping effect of the gripping surface(s) is extended over at least one large portion of the core surface of the reinforcing bars. Whereby, in response to an engaging of the reinforcing bars by the plurality of engagers, a strong couple is achieved and maintained due to this extended contact. Alternatively, the radius of curvature of the at least one recessed gripping surface may correspond to any radius of curvature being greater than the radius of curvature of the outer surface of the reinforcing bars at a cross-section of the reinforcing bars up to a maximum value corresponding to a circle having an infinite radius of curvature.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention the plurality of teeth may extend substantially transverse to the elongate tubular body or may be formed as screw threads or alternatively termed helical threads, such teeth being formed preferably as ribs or ridges along the gripping surface. In addition, the plurality of teeth may be hardened with a hardness greater than that of either the elongate tubular body and/or the reinforcing bars. The teeth may be formed as ridges, these ridges extending away from the inner surface of the tubular body towards the centre of the tubular body. In addition, at a cross-section through any one ridge, the ridge(s) may be symmetrical or unsymmetrical.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a coupling device wherein the plurality of engagers comprise different end portions, the different end portions being configured for a different engaging of the reinforcing bars. This different engaging of the bars including an engaging onto and into the reinforcing bars by the different end portions. For example, an engager comprising a first type of end portion may be configured to engage onto the reinforcing bars while an engager configured with a second or third type of end portion may be configured to engage into the reinforcing bars. The utilization of engagers comprising a plurality of different end portions allows the coupling device to maintain the coupling of reinforcing bars following a maximum loading force or tensile load applied to the reinforcing bars wherein at least one of the reinforcing bars breaks in a region outside the elongate tubular body following the applied'maximum loading force. As such, a coupling device is provided according to one aspect of the present invention which is configured to maintain the coupling of reinforcing bars following the application of a maximum loading force, wherein the maximum loading force is defined as a loading force which results in the breaking of at least one reinforcing bar in a region outside the coupling device, the maximum loading force corresponding to the ultimate tensile strength of the bars.<br>
As will be evident to the person skilled in the art, the coupling device as described herein is configurable for use in the coupling of cables, wires, bars or the like both used within the field of structural concrete and any type of use not limited to use within structural concrete.<br>
The elongate tubular body may be described as a sleeve-like body or receiving body configured for positioning over and about the bars, wires or cables so as to provide a coupling joint. Additionally, means for engaging the bars, wires or cable may comprise a plurality of engagers as described herein or alternatively any form or engager may be employed so as to provide a means for wedging the bars, wires or cables against the recessed gripping surface (alternatively termed<br><br>
a recessed wedging surface). For example, the means for engaging may comprise a form of engager being adjustably positioned onto, partially into the bars, wires or cables so as to wedge, press or abut the same against the recessed gripping surface.<br>

Detailed Description of the Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
There will now be described by way of example the best mode contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, well known methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 herein there is illustrated a plan view of the bar coupling device according to the specific implementation of the present invention. The coupling device 200 comprises an elongate tubular body 201, a plurality of longitudinally spaced holes 202 and a centrally located hole 204, according to the specific implementation of the present invention. The elongate tubular body 201 is manufactured from a steel or similar material and comprises a sufficient thickness to enable a secure coupling of reinforcing bars 101 and to provide sufficient strength to carry the load applied. Through the elongate tubular body 201 there are provided a plurality of longitudinally spaced holes 202 being of a diameter to allow an engaging bolt, pin, rivet or screw to be removably positioned within each hole 202 so as to interface with an interior of the elongate tubular body 201.<br>
According to the specific implementation of the present invention each of the longitudinally spaced holes 202 are provided with screw threads 203 being configured to engage with corresponding screw threads of an engaging bolt or screw.<br>
Positioned centrally along the elongate tubular body 201 is provided hole 204 being configured to allow insertion and removal of a pin, which when<br><br>
positioned centrally within said elongate tubular body extends through an inner surface of the tubular body 201.<br>
Referring to Figure 3 herein there is illustrated a cross-sectional side elevation view of the coupling device according to the specific implementation of the present invention. Coupling device 200 is illustrated comprising the elongate tubular body 201 an inner surface 300 at least one recessed gripping surface 301 a plurality of engagers 302, 303 and 304. Adjustably positioned within the plurality of longitudinally spaced holes 203 the plurality of engagers 302, 303 and 304 are configured to engage the reinforcing bars to be coupled.<br>
As is common to coupling devices found in the art, end portions of the reinforcing bars are received at the inner surface 300 of tubular body 201 whereby engagers 302, 303 and 304 are adjustably positioned to engage the reinforcing bars, in particular their end portions.

In operation, the coupling device 200 is configured to receive reinforcing bars, in particular their end portions, and to grip and couple the reinforcing bars 101 via gripping surfaces 500 and teeth 400 being formed on surfaces 500 in response to an engaging of the reinforcing bars 101 by the plurality of engagers.<br>
According to the specific implementation of the present invention the reinforcing bars 101 are seated on the recessed gripping surfaces 500 whereby due to the radius of curvature of gripping surfaces 500, extended contact is achieved and maintained between the coupling device 200 and the reinforcing bars 101. Additionally, time and effort need not be given to ensure reinforcing bars 101 are seated correctly within the coupling device 200 due to the provision of the recessed gripping surfaces 500 having radii of curvature being substantially equal to the radius of curvature of the outer surface of the reinforcing bars 101. As is common to reinforcing bars used in structural concrete, bars 101 typically comprise ribs 800 extending over a portion of the reinforcing bars outer surface. The radius of curvature of gripping surfaces 500 is provided so as to be substantially equal to a radius of curvature of the reinforcing bars 101 either at<br><br>
the core surface of the bars 101 or an outer surface formed by ribs 800. As such, and as a result of both the correct seating of reinforcing bars within the coupling device 200 and recessed gripping surfaces 500, and the extended contact between reinforcing bars 100 and gripping surfaces 500 (via teeth 400) longitudinal displacement (i.e. bar slip) of the bars relative to the coupling device is substantially restricted. In particular, the coupling device according to the specific implementation of the present invention is configured to maintain a coupling of the reinforcing bars 101 following a maximum loading force applied to the reinforcing bars, this maximum loading force being applied in a substantially lateral direction relative to the reinforcing bars and coupling device. The coupling device according to all specific implementations described herein with reference to Figures 2, 3,4, 5a, 5b, 6, 7, 8a, 8b and 9 is configured to maintain a bar couple or bar joint, up to and including the ultimate tensile strength of the bars after which loading force at least one reinforcing bar breaks in a region substantially outside the region of the elongate tubular body 201.<br>
The coupling device as described herein is configured to maintain a bar couple up to and including the ultimate tensile strength of the bars, such forces being applied to the bar joint as a result of the positioning of the bar within any particular concrete structure. For example, a compressive force would be resultant on the coupling device when aligned substantially vertically and positioned within a substantially vertical pillar being configured to support an elevated structure. Conversely, a tensile force applied to the coupling device would result from the positioning of the coupling device in a substantially horizontal alignment within a horizontal structure involving a substantially perpendicular or transverse loading force applied from above, for example. According to all specific implementations of the present invention the coupling device is configured to maintain a bar couple up to and including the ultimate tensile strength of the bars irrespective of the nature of forces applied e.g. tensile or compressive.<br><br><br>
According to the specific implementation of the present invention positively adjustable engagers 302, 303 and 304 are configured with a head portion 801 and a body portion 802, portions 801 and 802 being separated by a shear band 803 configurable such that in response to an applied torque force and following an engaging of engagers 302, 303 and 304 onto/into reinforcing bars 101 head portion 801 is configured to separate from body portion 802 via shear band 803.<br>
Referring to Figure 8b herein there is illustrated an end view of the coupling device according to the further specific implementation as detailed with reference to Figure 5b. In operation, reinforcing bars are received by tubular body 201 and seated on at least one recessed gripping surface 505 such that, and as with the coupling device described with reference to Figure 8a, the reinforcing bars 101 are seated slightly towards the lower region of the coupling device due to the seating within the recessed gripping surface. Engagers 302, 303 and 304 engage onto/into the reinforcing bars 101 thereby pressing or wedging the bars 101 against at least one recessed gripping surface and in particular teeth 400 formed on the gripping surface.<br>
Referring to Figure 9 herein there is illustrated a cross-sectional side elevation view of the coupling device according to the specific implementation of the present invention comprising an elongate tubular body 102, an inner surface 300, a plurality of engagers, 302, 303 and 304, and at least one recessed gripping surface 500, 505 and 507. In a specific mode of operation, pin 900 is removably inserted through hole 204 positioned centrally within tubular body 201 and extending through inner surface 300 so as to prevent any one of reinforcing bars 101 extending longitudinally beyond a central cross-section 901 of tubular body 201.<br>
Pin 900 is removably intertable through hole 204 such that according to a specific mode of joint assembly, tubular body 201 is slid fully over a single reinforcing bar 101. A second reinforcing bar is then correctly aligned relative to the reinforcing bar over which is positioned the tubular body such that tubular<br><br>
body 201 is displaced over the bar joint region. Pin 900 is then inserted and engagers 302, 303 and 304 are then adjusted to engage the reinforcing bars 101 thereby forming the couple.<br>
Positively adjustable engagers 302, 303 and 304 are positioned and adjusted in holes 203 to engage the reinforcing bars 101. In response, reinforcing bars 101 are pressed or wedged against at least one recessed gripping surface 500, 505 and 507 whereby a couple is formed between reinforcing bars 101. Through the provision and relative positioning of, in part, engagers 302, 303 and 304 having end portions 305, 306 and 307, respectively, in addition to at least one recessed gripping surface 500, 505 and 507, the coupling device 200, according to all specific implementations described herein, is configured to establish and maintain, without substantial bar strip, a coupling of reinforcing bars 101 up to and including the ultimate tensile strength of the bars. It will be further appreciated by those in the art that the coupling device as described herein is not restricted to the utilization of engaging bolts having a plurality of different end portions being functional instead with any manner of engagers having the same or similar end portions according to further specific implementations of the present invention.<br>
According to the specific implementation of the present invention engagers 302 comprise a first type of end portion configured for engaging onto reinforcing bars 101, engagers 303 comprise a second type of end portion configured for engaging partially into the reinforcing bars 101 and engagers 304 comprise a third type of end portion configured for engaging into the reinforcing bars 101.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the coupling device as described herein with reference to any one of the accompanying drawings is not limited to the coupling of reinforcing bars having a particular diameter.
