				<td>ACYCUC AND CYCLIC GUANIDINE- AND ACETAMIPINE PERIYATIVES. THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS PESTICIDES. ESP. AS PARASITIDES<br>
The present invention relates to novel pesticides ot the formula (1) below having improved action against parasites; to compositions suitable for use as parasiticides comprising those compounds as active ingredient and to methods of controlling parasites that are based on the administration of those compounds or compositions, and to the use of the said compounds and compositions in a method of controlling parasites and in the manufacture of pesticides for use against parasites. Also described are intermediates ot formula (XX) which themselves have parasiticidal activity and are excellently suitable for the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Numerous pesticides are known that can be used in controlling parasites on warm-blooded animals. The control is effected principally by two different methods; either by way of contact action by topical and therefore external treatment of the host animal or systemically, that is to say by oral, transdermal or percutaneous administration to the host animal and ingestion of the active ingredient by the parasites via the blood of the host animal.<br>
Far fewer substances are available for systemic use than for topical application, because only substances that have a systemic action and are well tolerated by the host animal can be used.<br><br>
A prominent individual example is nitenpyram, a compound of formula (III)<br><br><br>
Nitenpyram and other examples of this class of substances are disclosed, together with their preparation, in EP 0 302 389. Those compounds are described as pesticides having very pronounced insecticidal activity. Further examples of this class of substances are, for example, the subjects of the following patent applications: European published specifications Nos. 285 985; 302 833; 376 279; 471372; 364 844; 493 369; 381130; 529 680; 163 855; 375 907; 259 738; 386 565; 383 091 and 590 425; US Patents 5 063 236; 5 302 605 and 4 742 060; and also DE-4 207 604; GB-2 228 003 and WO 93/24002.<br>
Nitenpyram and other examples of this class of substances that have the said structural element of formula {II) are extremely effective when administered as contact pesticides, for example externally, that is to say topically, to an infested host animal where they come into direct contact with the parasites. They also, however, exhibit a good systemic immediate action when they are administered to the infested host animal orally, parenterally, via injection or via implant.<br>
The action, which is pronounced perse, has a serious disadvantage, however, in that it has been found that while the compounds have a high initial action, their action falls off rapidly only a short time after administration. This can be observed particularly clearly after systemic administration and can be monitored by reference to the bioavailability. Blood level measurements show that in many cases high blood levels are achieved even after a few minutes or, more rarely, after a few hours, but these levels then fall within a few hours, at best within a few days, and therefore fall to below an effective concentration much too rapidly.<br>
In order to eliminate this shortcoming, numerous, but unfortunately unsuccessful, experi¬ments have already been carried out. For example, it has been shown that a prolongation of the systemic action by increasing the dose can be achieved only to a limited extent. If, for example, depots sufficiently large for the active ingredient to be released over several weeks were to be placed under the skin or in the muscles, then the amounts to be injected<br><br><br>

Certain substituted 4-nltroimino-perhydro-1.3.5-oxadiazine derivatives and their use as pesticides and intermediates are described in WO 98/06710. Nitenpyram and other examples of this class of substances that have the said structural element of formula (II) are extremely effective when administered as contact pesticides, for example externally, that is to say topically, to an infested host animal where they come into direct contact with the parasites. They also, however, exhibit a good systemic immediate action when they are administered to the infested host animal orally, parenterally, via injection or via implant.<br>
The action, which is pronounced perse, has a serious disadvantage, however, in that it has been found that while the compounds have a high initial action, their action falls off rapidly only a short time after administration. This can be observed particularly cleariy after systemic administration and can be monitored by reference to the bioavailability. Blood level measurements show that in many cases high blood levels are achieved even after a few minutes or, more rarely, after a few hours, but these levels then fall within a few hours, at best within a few days, and therefore fall to below an effective concentration much loo rapidly.<br>
In order to eliminate this shortcoming, numerous, but unfortunately unsuccessful, experi¬ments have already been carried out. For example, it has been shown that a prolongation of the systemic action by increasing the dose can be achieved only to a limited extent. If, for example, depots sufficiently large for the active ingredient to be released over several weeKs were to be placed under the skin or in the muscles, then the amounts to be injected<br><br>
or implanted would have to be so large that they would no longer be tolerated by the host animal; local irritation, skin eruptions and painful areas develop. This solution, possible per se, therefore fails on practical and, of course, also ethical grounds. Similarly, it has been found that a long-term action is not achievable by an increased oral dose.<br>
When the known compounds having the structural element of formula ( II ) are administered, it is principally observed that a major part of the substance exhibits its full action only over a short period of time immediately after administration and thereafter the action very rapidly declines. This has serious consequences for preparations for use in veterinary medicine, for example for tablets, injections or for treatment using the pour-on or spot-on method. Because of the short duration of action it is necessary to repeat treatments at short intervals, which means that the keeper of the animal must either repeat the treatment himself, or have it carried out by a veterinary surgeon, at short intervals. Such an intensive treatment programme requires a high degree of discipline, however, and, as experience has shown, after only a short time gives rise to stress on the part of the animal and on the part of the animal"s keeper, which not infrequently results in aversion to the treatment and ieads to its premature discontinuation.<br>
Prolongation of the action of this inherently extremely effective class of substances has therefore long been a desirable but apparently unattainable goal. The problem underlying the present invention was to achieve that goal and provide substances suitable for use as pesticides having significantly improved properties, especially having a pronounced long-term action.<br>
By the provision of the compounds of formula (() below it has now, surprisingly, been possible for compounds having the structural element of formula ( II ) to be modified chemically in such a manner that a high degree of long-term bioavailability after administration is achieved without it being necessary to accept adverse effects as a result.<br>
The new, improved compounds are compounds of formula (1) below<br><br><br>

wherein R?, Re" and R are as defined for fonnula (I), it has now been possible to prepare substances that exhibit simultaneously a number of long sought and very desirable properties and are now actually suitable for practical use:<br>
1.	The compounds of formula (I) have a high level of activity against arthropods,<br>
especially blood-sucking insects.<br>
2.	They exhibit excellent tolerability when administered systemically and topically to a<br>
host animal.<br><br>
3.	They are distinguished by an appreciably longer duration of action in comparison with known compounds having the structural element of formula (II), which can readily be demonstrated by reference to the mortality of the parasites on the host animal.<br>
4.	They can be handled satisfactorily from the standpoint of formulation technology and have adequate storage stability.<br>
It was not to be predicted that the chemical modification carried out here would result in these advantageous properties and would be able to impart to the novel compounds of formula (I) these positive long-term properties.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the definitions of the substituents are to be under¬stood as follows: each of the substituents indicated under formula (I) that can itself be poly-substituted is substituted by either identical or different substituents, that is to say multiple substitutions are to be interpreted as meaning that identical or different substituents can be present simultaneously on the same radical. For example, a radical poly-substituted by halogen may have either several identical halogen atoms or several different halogen atoms, fsflultiple substitutions are to be interpreted accordingly tor other radicals.<br>
The alkyl groups appearing in the definitions of substituents in terms such as alkyl, alkyl-carbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkyi, alkylamino, dialkylamino, haloalkyl-carbonyl, etc. may, according to the number of carbon atoms, be straight-chain or branched and are, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl or eicosyl, and the branched isomers thereof, e.g. isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl, neopentyl or isohexyl. Alkoxy, haloalkyi, haloalkylcarbonyl and haloalkoxy radicals are derived from the mentioned alkyl groups and accordingly are partially or fully balogenated radicals; poly-halogenated radicals carry identical or different halogen atoms.<br>
The tenns halo and halogen denote halogen atoms and generally denote fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, here preferably fluorine or chlorine, as substituent of an alkyl group especially fluorine and as substituent of a heterocycle especially chlorine.<br>
Examples of haloalkyi - as a group per se and as a structural element of other groups and compounds, such as haloalkoxy - are methyl mono- to tri-substituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, such as CHF2 or CFy, ethyl mono- to penta-substituted by fluorine, chlorine<br><br>
and/or bromine, such as CH2CF3, CF2CF3, CFCCIa, CF2CHCI2, CFsCHFj, CF2CFCI2, CFaCHBrs, CFECHCIF, CFsCHBrF or CClFCHCtF; propyl or isopropyl mono- to hepta-substituted by fluorine, cinlorine and/or bromine, such as CHaCHBrCHaBr, CF2CHFCF3, CH2CF2CF3 or CHtCFa) 2, and butyl mono- to nona-substituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, or one of its isomers, such as CF(CF3)CHFCF3 or CH2(CF2) 2CF3.<br>
In the context of the present invention, Het and heterocyclyl are to be understood as mean¬ing aliphatic or aromatic cyclic radicals that contain at least one oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atom. Five- and six-membered heterocycles are preferred. Heterocyclyl accordingly typically includes substituents such as dioxolanyi, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, pyridyl, pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, tetrahydrofuryl, tetrahydropyranyl, difiydrofuryl, dihydro-pyranyl, isoxazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazollnyl, oxazolldinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl and dioxanyl. Special preference is given to those which are unsubstituted or contain one or two halogen atoms, halogen here being fluorine, chlorine or bromine, but especially chlorine. Of tfiose heterocyclic radicals special mention should be made of pyridyl, thiazolyl and tetrahydrofuryl. More especially preferred sub-groups of formula (I) contain as heterocyclyl radicals 5,6-dichloro-pyridin-3-yl, 6-chloro-pyridin-3-yl, 2-chlorothiazol-5-yl and tetrahydrofuran-3-yl.<br>
Aryl by itself or as part of a substituent, for example arylsulfonyl, arylcarbonyl or aralkyl, is phenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl.<br>
Alkenyl is, in each case giving due consideration to the number of cariDon atoms contained in the group in question, either straight-chain, e.g. vinyl, 1-methylvinyl, allyl, 1-butenyl or2-hexenyl, or branched, e.g. isopropenyl. Alkynyl is, in each case giving due consideration to the number of cartoon atoms contained in the group in question, either straight-chain, e.g. propargyl, 2-butynyl or 5-hexynyl, or branched, e.g. 2-ethynylpropyl or 2-propargylisopropyl. Cs-C/CycloalkyI is cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl.<br>
Typical C1-C4alkylene bridges are -CH2-, -CHs-CHa-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH(CH3)-CH2-, -CH(C2H5)-CH2-, -CHa-CHlCHgj-CHa-, -CH(CH3)-CH{CH3)-, -C(CH3)2-, -C{CH3)(C2H5)- and -C(C2H5)2-.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (I) having at feast one basic centre may form acid addition salts witti strong acids. Physioiogically tolerable acid addition salts are of special interest.<br>

Parasites in the context of the present invention are parasitic arthropods and, of those, especially blood-sucking insects. Insects of the following orders are included: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Orthoptera, Anoplura, Siphon-aptera, Mallophaga. Thysanura, Isoptera, Psocoptera and Hymenoptera. Special mention should also be made, however, of pests that trouble human beings or animals and transmit pathogens, for example flies, such as Musca domesfica, Musca vefuslissima, Musca autumnalis, Fannia canicularis, Sarcophaga camaria, Lucilia sericata, Lucitia cuprina, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum,  Chrysomyia chloropyga,  Dermatobia hominis,<br><br>
Cochliomyia hominivorax, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Oestrus ovis, Callipora erythrocephala (= blowfly), Haematobia (= hornfly) and mosquitos, and also blood-sucking pests, for example fleas, such as Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis (cat and dog fleas), Xenopsylla cheopis. Pulex irritans, Dermatophilus penetrans, lice, such as Damalina ovis, Pedicutus humanis, stable flies and horseflies, such as Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematopota pluvialis. Tabanus nigrovittatus. Chrysops caecutiens, tabanids, tsetse flies, such as Glossinta species, and biting insects, more especially cockroaches, such as Blatella germanic or Blatta ohentalis, Periplaneta americana. The said parasites attack warm¬blooded animals, including farm animals, such as cows, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry, such as hens, turkeys and geese, animals bred for their fur, such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as domestic animals and pets, such as cats and dogs, and even human beings do not escape attack.<br>
Likewise, flea infestation in domestic animals and pets is a problem for the animal owner to which as yet only unsatisfactory solutions have been found. Owing to the complicated life cycle of the flea, none of the known methods of controlling fleas is totally satisfactory, especially since most of the known methods are aimed principally at controlling the fully grown fleas in the animal"s coat and take no account at all of the various juvenile stages of the fleas, which live not only in the animal"s coat but also on the floor, on carpets, on the animal"s sleeping place, on chairs, in the garden and in all the other places with which the infested animal comes into contact. Flea treatment is generally expensive and must be continued for a prolonged period, success generally only being achieved when the treatment is applied not only to the infested animal, e.g. the dog or cat, but also simultaneously to any places frequented by the infested animal.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention can be used alone or in combina¬tion with other biocides. For example, in order to increase the effect they can be combined with pesticides having the same direction of action or in order to broaden the spectrum of action they can be combined with substances having a different direction of action. It may also be of advantage to add repelling substances, so-called repellents. Where it is desired to extend the spectrum of action to endoparasites, e.g. wonns, the compounds of formula (I) are advantageously combined with substances having endoparasiticidal properties. They can, of course, also be used in combination with anti-bacterial agents. Since the<br><br>
compounds of formula (I) are "adulticides", that is to say since they are effective especially against the fully grown stages of the target parasites, the addition of pesticides that are effective rather against the juvenile stages of the parasite may be very advantageous, since in that way the majority of parasites causing large-scale economic damage will be covered. Furthermore, a substantial contribution is made to avoiding the development of resistance. Some combinations may also lead to synergistic effects, that is to say the total amount of active ingredient applied can be reduced, which is desirable from the ecological standpoint. Preferred groups of combination partners and especially preferred combination partners are given below, it being possible for the combinations to comprise one or more of these partners in addition to a compound of formula (I).<br><br>
Suitable mixing partners include biocides, for example the insecticides and acaricides listed below, which have various mechanisms of action and are well known to the person skilled in the art, for example chitin synthesis inhibitors, growrth regulators; active ingredients that act in the same way as juvenile hormones; active ingredients that act as adulticides; broad spectrum Insecticides; broad spectrum acaricides and nematicides; and also the well known anthelmintics and substances that repel insects and/or acarina, the afore-mentioned repellents or detachers, Non-limiting examples of suitable insecticides and acaricides are:<br>

In the compounds of formula (XX), as regards the substituents Ri, R2, R2", X, Y, T and U preference is given to the same substituents as those already mentioned for the preferred sub-groups of compounds of formula (I), Hal preferably being fluorine or chlorine, especially chlorine. As a result of the Hal substituent, these novel compounds are excellently suitable for further derivatisation and therefore for the preparation of parasiticides, for example the compounds of formula {I).<br>
The reactions illustrated and described hereinabove and hereinbelow are carried out in a manner known perse, for example in the absence or, usually, in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof, the operation being carried out, as required, with cooling, at room temperature or with heating, for example in a temperature range of from about -sec to the boiling temperature of the reaction medium, preferably from about -40°C to about +120°C, especially from -20""C to 40°C and, if necessary, in a closed vessel, under pressure, in an inert gas atmosphere and/or under anhydrous conditions. Especially advantageous reaction conditions for each individual reaction step can be found in the explanations which follow and in the specific Preparation Examples.<br>
Unless special conditions are mentioned, the reactants can in principle be reacted with one another as such, that is to say without the addition of a solvent or diluent, for example in the molten state. It is more advantageous, however, to add an inert solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof. Examples of such solvents or diluents that may be mentioned include: aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, Tetralin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, bromo-benzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetra-chloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethene or tetrachloroethene; esters, such as ethyl acetate; ethers, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dimethoxydiethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanot, butanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol; amides, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-diethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide; nitriles, such as acetonitrile or propionitrile; and sulf¬oxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide.

compounds of formula (XX), as regards the substituents R,, R2, Rj", X, Y, T and U preference is given to the same substituents as those already mentioned for the prefen-ed sub-groups of compounds of formula (I), Hal preferably being fluorine or chlorine, especially chlorine. As a result of the Hal substituent, these novel compounds are excellently suitable for further derivatisation and therefore for the preparation of parasiticides, for example the compounds of formula {I).<br>
The reactions illustrated and described hereinabove and herelnbelow are carried out in a manner known per se. for example in the absence or, usually, in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof, the operation being earned out, as required, with cooling, at room temperature or with heating, for example in a temperature range of from about -80°C to the boiling temperature of the reaction medium, preferably from about -40°C to about +120°C, especially from -20°C to 40°C and, if necessary, in a closed vessel, under pressure, in an inert gas atmosphere and/or under anhydrous conditions.

It is more advantageous, however, to add an inert solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof. Examples of such solvents or diluents that may be mentioned include: aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesltylene, Tetralin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, bromo-benzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetra-chloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroetheno or tetrachloroethene; esters, such as ethyl acetate; ethers, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, dlisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dimethoxydiethyl ether, telrahydrofuran or dioxane; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, ethylene glycol or glycerol; amides, such as N,N-dimethylfomamide, N,N-dtethylfomiamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrroltdone or hexamethylphosphoric acid triamrde; nitrites, such as acetonitrile or propionitrile; and sulf¬oxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide. If the reaction In question is carried out in the presence of a base, bases used in excess, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylnx&gt;rpholine or<br><br>
N,N-diethylaniline, may also serve as solvent or diluent. If the reaction is carried out in the presence of an add catalyst, it is also possible to employ as solvent or diluent acids used in excess, e.g. strong organic carboxylic acids, such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, Cr04alkanecarboxyllc acids, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid. Suitable solvents for the reaction in question can be taken from the Examples given below.<br>
Bases suitable for facilitating those reactions in which base catalysts may optionally be used are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrides, alkylides, amides, alkanolates, acetates, carbonates, dialkylamides or alkylsilylamides; alkylamines, alkylenediamines, free or N-alkylated, saturated or unsaturated cycloalkylamines, basic heterocycles, ammonium hydroxides and also carbocyclic amines. Examples are butyllithium, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium methanolate, sodium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium tert-butanolate, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, potassium bis{tri-methylsilyl)amide, calcium hydride, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, triethylenedlamine, cyclohexylamine, N-cyclohexy[-N,N-dimethylamine, N,N-diethylaniline, pyridine, 4-{N,N-dtmethylamino)pyridine, quinuclidine, N-methylmorpholine, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide and also 1,5-dlazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-5-ene (DBU). For replacing chlorine by iodine in a compound of formula (VI), the base used is preferably silver carbonate and the reagent used sodium iodide.<br>
The procedure in detail is as follows: the compounds of formula (I) are prepared by either (a) reacting a compound of formula (IX ) in an aprotic, advantageously polar, solvent in the presence of a suitable base and at relatively low temperatures with a compound of formula (VIII) or preferably (b) reacting a compound of formula ( XX ) with an acid RCOOH and isolating the end product from the reaction mixture, the substituents R, R,, Rz, R2", X, Y, T and U being as defined for formula (I); W being a leaving group; and Hal being halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine. The reaction is advantageously carried out in an anhydrous medium and under an inert gas atmosphere, for example under nitrogen or argon. The said reactions take place within a period of minutes up to several hours.<br><br>
A preferred embodiment comprises the following features: the compound of formula (IX) is first dissolved in an anhydrous, aprotic, polar solvent, and then at a relatively low tempera¬ture, for example at ambient temperature or lower, an equimolar amount of one of the suitable bases described above, for example sodium hydride, is added and the mixture is stirred for a little longer at the same temperature. An equimolar amount of the compound of formula ( VIII ) dissolved in the same solvent is then added in portions, e.g. by dropwise addition, and stirring of the reaction mixture is continued at the same low temperature for a little longer. Any excess base is then neutralised and the reaction mixture is stirred for a few minutes longer and finally concentrated. The residue is advantageously taken up in a polar solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and optionally washed with water, and the organic phase is separated off and dried over a drying agent, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal sulfate or carbonate, preferably magnesium or sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified. A suitable purification step is chromatography, for example on silica gel (ethyl acetate : hexane /1 ;1). Compounds of formula (I) are generally obtained in the form of colourless to dark yellow oils, resins or in the form of solids. The said oils and resins crystallise after a few days or weeks when stored, for example, in a freezer at about from -18° to -25°C. In the context of the present invention, relatively low temperatures are to be understood as being temperatures around room temperature and below or a temperature range of from about +25°C to about -SOX, preferably from room temperature to about -20°C.<br>
The compounds of formula ( IX ) are known per se from the literature or can be prepared analogously to the examples described in the literature. For example, compounds of fomiula (IX) wherein Het is pyrldyl that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen are described, together with their preparation, in European published specification EP-0 302 833. Further compounds of formula ( IX ) are disclosed in the following patent references, for example in European published specifications Nos. 285 985; 302 389, 376 279; 471372; 364 844; 493 369; 381 130; 529 680; 163 855; 375 907; 259 738; 386 565; 383 091 and 590 425; US Patents 5 063 236; 5 302 605 and 4 742 060; and also in DE-4 207 604; GB-2 228 003 and WO 93/24002.<br>
The compounds of formula ( VIII) wherein R, Ra and Ra" are as defined for formula (I) and W is one of the leaving groups mentioned above can be prepared by introducing the radical RCOO- into a compound of fonnula ( VI). For that purpose it is advantageous to prepare a suspension of a compound of fonnula ( VI ) wherein Hal Is iodine and an organic acid<br><br>
R-COOH, an example of which is benzoic acid, and silver carbonate in an aprotic solvent, e.g. toluene or xylene. The suspension is heated at from about SOX to about 100X for a few hours and then the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and insoluble constituents are filtered off. The filtrate is washed with water and/or aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over a customary drying agent, such as magnesium or sodium sulfate. On concentration, the compound of formula ( VIII) is obtained in the form of an oil or a crystalline solid. It is generally unnecessary to carry out further purification before use in the next reaction step.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula ( VI ) wherein R2 and R" are as defined for formula (I), W is one of the leaving groups mentioned hereinabove and Hal is iodine is effected by replacing by iodine the chlorine atom in a compound of formula ( VI) wherein Hal is chlorine. For this purpose a suspension of the compound of formula (VI) wherein Hal is clilorine, an equimolar amount of sodium iodide and sodium hydrogen carbonate in a polar solvent, such as acetone, is prepared and Is stirred at slightly elevated temperature, about 40°C, for from 12 to 24 hours. The resulting precipitate is filtered off and washed with acetone. The filtrate is concentrated, and diethyl ether and water are added. The organic phase is separated off and washed with aqueous potassium sulfite solution, then washed with aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over a customary drying agent, such as magnesium or sodium sulfate. On concentration, the compound of formula (VI) is obtained in the form of a colourless, crystalline product, which can be filtered off and freed of solvent residues, e.g. in vacuo. Further purification before use in the next reaction step is unnecessary.<br>
Compounds of formula ( VI ) can be prepared by dissolving compounds of formula (VI) wherein R2 and R2" are as defined for formula (I) and W is chlorine in a halogenated solvent, such as dichloromsthane, and at low temperature, advantageously about 0°C, adding a solution of a compound of the formula H-W In portions and then stim"ng the reaction mixture at the low temperature for about 1 to 3 hours. Water is then added and the organic phase is separated off, washed with 1N sodium hydroxide solution and then with aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over a drying agent, e.g. magnesium sulfate. On concentration, the compound of formula ( VI) is obtained in the form of a colourless, crystalline product, which can be filtered off and freed of solvent residues in vacuo.<br><br>
As illustrated in the above reaction scheme, the novel compounds of formula (XX) are prepared by reacting a compound of formula { IX ) in an aprotic, advantageously polar, solvent in the presence of a suitable base and at relatively low temperatures, with a compound of formula ( VI ), the substituents R,, Ra, R", X, Y, T and U in the formulae ( XX), (IX ) and ( Vt) being as defined for formula (1); W being a leaving group; and Hal being halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine and preferably chlorine or iodine. The compound of formula ( IX ) is first dissolved in an anhydrous, aprotic, polar solvent, and then at relatively low temperature, e.g. ambient temperature or lower, an equimolar amount of one of the suitable bases described above, e.g sodium hydride, is added and the mixture is stirred for a little longer at the same temperature. An equimolar amount of the compound of formula ( VI ) dissolved in the same solvent is then added in portions, e.g. by dropwise addition, and stirring of the reaction mixture is continued at the same low temperature for a little longer. Any excess base is then neutralised and the reaction mixture is stirred lor a few minutes longer and finally concentrated. The residue is advantageously taken up in a polar solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and optionally washed with water, and the organic phase is separated off and dried over a drying agent, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal sulfate or carbonate, preferably magnesium or sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified. A suitable purification step is chromatography, for example on silica gel {ethyl acetate ; hexane / 1 :1). Compounds of formula (XX) are generally obtained in the form of colourless to dark yellow oils, resins or, predominantly, in the form of solids.<br><br>

The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for a further 2 hours and then 1000 ml of H2O are added. The organic phase is washed using 250 ml each of 1N NaOH and aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over MgS04.<br><br>

In an analogous manner it is also possible to prepare the following typical compounds listed in the Table.<br>
Typical compounds of formula (I) are listed in Tables 1 to 4, while Tables 5 to 8 give typical examples of intermediates of formula (XX). The present invention is not limited to the typical examples shown, however.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the animal to be treated externally or internally in a formulated form. "Formulated" in this case means, for example, in the form of a powder, a tablet or granules, in liposomes or a capsule, in the form of an emulsion, a foam or a spray, in microencapsulated form or In pour-on or spot-on form. It will be understood that all orally administrable compositions may comprise, in addition to customary formulation substances, further additives that encourage the host animal to take the composition orally voluntarily, e.g. suitable odoronts and flavourings.<br>
Percutaneous administration, for example by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or as a depot preparation in the form of an implant, and topical application, for example in pour-on or spot-on form, represent preferred subjects of this invention on account of their being easy to carry out. A further mode of administration is oral administration, e.g. in the form of a tablet. Percutaneous and topical forms of administration are of particular interest and give excellent results.<br>
Percutaneous forms of administration include, for example, subcutaneous, intramuscular and even intravenous administration of injectable forms. In addition to the customary syringes with needles, it is also possible to use needle-less high-pressure syringe devices.<br>
Pour-on and spot-on formulations are especially preferred as topical forms of administration, but administration in the fomi of sprays, ointments, solutions or powders may also be expedient.<br>
By selection of a suitable formulation it Is possible to enhance the ability of the active ingredients to penetrate into the living tissue of the host animal and/or to maintain its availability. That is important when, for example, rather sparingly soluble active ingredients are used, the low solubility of which requires means for enhancing solubility, since in such cases the animal"s body fluid will be capable of dissolving only small amounts of active ingredient at a time.<br>
In order to obtain a greatly delayed release of active ingredient, a compound of fonnula (I) according to the invention may also be present in a matrix formulation which physically prevents the active ingredient from being released and excreted prematurely and maintains<br><br>
the bioavailability of the active ingredient. Such a matrix formulation is injected into the body, e.g. intramuscularly or subcutaneously, and remains there as a form of depot from which active ingredient is released continuously. Such matrix formulations are known to a person skilled in the art. They are generally wax-like, semi-solid substances, for example vegetable waxes and polyethylene glycols having a high molecular weight, or solid polymer formulations, for example so-called microspheres.<br>
The rate of release of the active ingredient from the implant and thus the period of time over which the implant exhibits an action is generally determined by the accuracy with which the implant has been calibrated (amount of active ingredient in the implant), the environment around the implant and the polymer formulation from which the implant has been made.<br>
The administration of veterinary medicinal additives to animal food is well known in the field of animal health. It is usual first to prepare a so-called premix in which the active ingredient is dispersed in a liquid or is present in finely divided form in solid carriers. The premix can normally comprise about 1 to 800 mg of compound per kg of premix, depending on the desired final concentration in the food.<br>
Since the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention may be hydrolysed by the constituents of the food, they should be formulated in a protective matrix, for example In gelatin, before being added to the premix.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to the aspect of controlling parasites by administering to the host animal with its food a compound of formula (I) that has been protected against hydrolysis.<br>
A compound of formula (I) according to the invention is advantageously administered in a dose of from 0.01 to 800 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 200 mg/kg, especially from 0.5 to 30 mg/kg body weight, based on the host animal.<br>
A good dose that can be administered regularly to the host animal is from 0.5 to 100 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 40 mg/kg body weight. The administration is effected at suitable intervals in dependence upon the mode of administration and body weight.<br><br>
The total dose may vary for the same active ingredient from one species of animal to another and also within a species of animal, since it depends inter alia on the weight, age and constitution of the host animal.<br>
When used according to the invention, the compound of formula (I) according to the invention will normally be administered not in pure form but preferably in the form of a composition that comprises, in addition to the active ingredient, constituents that assist administration, suitable constituents being those which are tolerated by the host animal. It is of course possible, as well as controlling the adult parasites in accordance with the invention, additionally to use conventional methods to control the juvenile stages of the fleas, although the latter is not absolutely essential.<br>
Such compositions to be administered in accordance with the invention generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula (I) according to the invention and from 99.9 to 1 % by weight, especially from 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid, physiologically tolerable carrier, including from 0 to 25 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a non-toxic dispersant,<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
Such formulations may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers as well as other active ingredients for obtaining special effects.<br>
The physiologically tolerable carriers known from veterinary medicinal practice for oral, percutaneous and topical administration can be used as formulation adjuvants. Some examples are given below.<br>
Suitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tri-calcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and binders, such as starch pastes using, for example, maize, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcelluiose and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxy-<br><br>
methyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Adjuvants are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Drag6e cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings, there being used Inter alia concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arable, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes, flavourings or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
Other orally administrable compositions are hard gelatin capsules, and also soft sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticiser, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard gelatin capsules may comprise the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingre¬dient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, to which stabilisers may also have been added. Preference is given inter alia to capsules that may easily be bitten through or swallowed without being chewed.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method comprises applying the compound of formula (I) to a locally limited area of the skin or coat, advantageously on the back of the neck or the backbone of the animal. This is carried out, for example, by applying the pour-on or spot-on formulation using a swab or spray to a relatively small area of the coat from where the active ingredient becomes distributed over a wide area of the coat almost automatically as a result of the spreading constituents of the formulation assisted by the movements of the animal.<br>
Pour-on and spot-on formulations advantageously comprise carriers that assist rapid distribution over the surface of the skin and in the coat of the host animal and are generally termed spreading oils. There are suitable, for example, oily solutions; alcoholic and<br><br>
isopropanolic solutions, e,g. solutions of 2-octyl dodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalic ester, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, caproic acid esters of saturated fatty alcohols of chain length CI2-CIB; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols. It may be advantageous for a dispersant known from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industry also to be present. Examples are pyrrolidin-2-one, N-alkylpyrrolidin-2-one, acetone, polyethylene glycol and its ethers and esters, propylene glycol or synthetic triglycerides.<br>
The oily solutions include e.g. vegetable oils, such as olive oil, groundnut oil, sesame oil, pine oil, linseed oil and castor oil. The vegetable oils may also be in epoxidised form. It is also possible to use paraffins and silicone oils.<br>
Generally a pour-on or spot-on formulation will contain from 1 to 20 % by weight of a compound of formula (I), from 0.1 to 50 % by weight dispersant and from 45 to 98.9 % by<br>
weight solvent.<br>
The pour-on and spot-on methods can be used especially advantageously for herd animals, such as cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, where it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or via injection. By virtue of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals and pets, and is welcomed especially by the keepers of the animals because it can frequently be carried out without the expert assistance of a veterinary surgeon.<br>
Suitable for parenteral and percutaneous administration are oily injection solutions or suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate, or triglycerides, or aqueous injection solutions or suspensions that comprise viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, optionally, stabilisers.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophi-<br><br>
Using processes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, optionally granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, after the addition of suitable excipients, to form tablets or dragee cores.<br>
The following Examples and patent claims illustrate the invention described above, but do not limit its scope in any way. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. In the following Formulation Examples the expression "compound of formula (I)" is used to represent a compound of Tables 1 to 3, especially benzoic acid ({1-l(6-chloro-pyridin-3-ylmetliyl)-elhyl-amino]-2-nitro-vinyl}-methyl-carbamoyloxy)-methyl ester.<br><br>
Preparation: All the solid ingredients are first forced through a sieve of 0.6 mm mesh size. Then the active ingredient, the lactose, the talcum and half the starch are mixed together. The other half of the starch is suspended in 40 ml of water and the suspension is added to a boiling solution of the polyethylene glycol in 100 ml of water. The resulting starch paste is added to the main batch and the mixture is granulated, if necessary with the addition of water. The granules are dried overnight at 35°, forced through a sieve of 1.2 mm mesh size, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to form tablets which have a mesh size of about 6 mm and which are concave on both sides.<br><br><br>
It is also possible to add to the described compositions biologically active substances or additives that have neutral behaviour tovifards the compounds of formula (I) and have no adverse effect on the host animal to be treated, and also mineral salts or vitamins.<br><br>
Analogously to the described formulations of Examples 1 to 8 it is also possible to prepare further preparations having active ingredients of formula (I).<br>
Example 6: Control of adult fleas in cats by means of pour-on application<br>
Test protocol for each test compound: in order to determine the effectiveness of the test compounds against fully grown fleas, four groups each of two cats are used. Each cat is infested with 100 cat fleas [Ctenocephalides fetis (Bouche)] and treated with 20 mg of active ingredient per kg body weight. The treatment is effected by applying the formulation to a locally limited area on the back of the cat"s neck. While one group is infested with fleas but is treated only with a placebo, that is to say a formulation without active ingredient, and serves as control, another group is treated with nitenpyram as comparison substance; the two remaining groups receive the test compounds. Evaluation is made in each case by combing surviving fleas out of the animal"s coat and comparing the number counted with the number of fleas in the control group and in the group treated with nitenpyram. The procedure in detail is as follows: each cat is infested with 100 fleas immediately after treatment on day 0. On day +1, each animal is combed and the number of surviving fleas is determined; the surviving fleas are then replaced on the same cat and after 24 hours the combing and evaluation are repeated. The fleas still surviving after those 24 hours are not returned to the cat. The described procedure is then repeated on days +3, +7, +9, +14, +21, +28, +35, +42, +49, +56 and +63 and in this way the effectiveness and duration of action are determined. The effectiveness Is determined in accordance with the following formula:<br><br>
It is shown that the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention achieve excellent long-term action. Very good action is obtained, for example, with compounds Nos. 1.001, 1.008,1.011, 1.012, 1.013, 1.014, 1.015, 1.018, 1.020, 1.021 and 1.022. An especially high level of long-term activity is exhibited by compounds 1.008, 1.011 and 1.012. Full action (100% effectiveness) is observed over a period of at least 7 weeks and after 7 weeks the action gradually declines to 26%. In comparison, nitenpyram exhibits full action {100% effectiveness) only for a maximum of 3 weeks. In a further, fully analogous test, compounds<br><br>
1.019, 1.056, 1.057 and 1.058 also exhibit a long-term action equally as excellent as the compounds mentioned above.<br>
In dogs the lest proceeds in an entirely analogous manner. In order to investigate the total action and any side-effects after administration in the form of a pour-on formulation, compound No. 1.008 is selected and tested on 11 dogs. The test protocol and the results are given in Example 7.<br>
Example 7: Control of adult fleas in doQS by means of pour-on application w"tih compound No. 1.008 of Table 1<br>
Test protocol for each test compound: in order to determine the effectiveness of the test compounds against fully grown fleas, three groups each of three dogs (1 male and 2 female beagles) are used; one group consists of two dogs (2 male beagles) and serves as control group. The entire test group consists of 11 beagles between 1 and 3.5 years of age. Each dog is infested with a total of 100 dog fleas [Ctenocephalides canis ], 50 male and 50 female. Group 1 is treated with 2 mg, group 2 with 10 mg and group 3 with 20 mg of active ingredient per kg body weight. The treatment is effected by applying the pour-on formulation to a locally limited area on the back of the dog"s neck. The fourth group is the control group. The latter Is infested with fleas but is treated only with a placebo, that is to say a formulation without active ingredient, and serves for control purposes. Evaluation is made in each case by combing surviving fleas out o1 the animal"s coat and comparing the number counted with the number of fleas in the control group. The procedure in detail is as follows: after treatment with the test formulation (day 0) each dog is infested on each of the subsequent days +1, -H7, -f14, +23, +28, +35, +49, +56, +63, +70, +77, +84 and +98 with 100 fleas. On the following day, each animal is combed and the number of surviving fleas is determined. The surviving fleas are then replaced on the same dog and after 24 hours the combing and evaluation are repeated. The fleas still surviving after those further 24 hours (2nd day after infestation with 100 fleas) are not returned to the dog. Then on days +3, +7, +9, +14, +21, +28, +35, +42 etc. the described procedure is repeated and in this way the effectiveness and the duration of action are determined. The effectiveness is detemiined using the fonnula given in Example 6.<br>
79 days after application of the pour-on formulation, the test compound exhibits 100 % action; it is still 98.6 % effective on day 86 and even on day 98 it continues to be 92.3 % effective. Whereas the dogs from the three test groups exhibit no skin irritation or any other<br><br>
undesirable side-effects, the two dogs in the control group have to be removed from the test programme on day 84, because they exhibit serious allergy symptoms and skin irritation as a result of the numerous flea bites.<br>
Corresponding effects are also observed when the substances are administered not in pour-on form but in the form of an injection solution.<br>
Example 8: Control of adult fleas in cats by means of subcutaneous injection Test protocol for each test compound: in order to determine the effectiveness of the test compounds against fully grown fleas, four groups each of two cats from 1.5 to 4 years of age are used. Each cat is infested with 100 cat fleas [Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche)]. Two groups are treated with 20 mg of active ingredient per [<g body weight. the treatment is effected by subcutaneous injection of a solution active ingredient behind left shoulder blade. while one group infested with fleas but treated only placebo that to say formulation without and serves as control another nitenpyram comparison substance. evaluation made in each case combing surving out animal coat comparing number counted nitenpyram. procedure detail follows: cat immediately after on day combed surviving determined are then replaced same hours repeated. still those not returned cat. described repeated days this way effectiveness duration action determined. using formula preceding example. it found compounds according invention achieve excellent long-term injection. very good achieved for example nos. an especially high level activity exhibited compound full observed period at least analogous test dogs leads absolutely comparable results.></g>
