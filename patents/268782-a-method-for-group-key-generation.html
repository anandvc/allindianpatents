The system performing the key generation has stored component keys corresponding to every possible subset X of the unitary set, where subsets X have k or fewer members. The privileged group key is generated for the privileged set by passing ordered component keys of subsets X that do not contain members of the privileged set to a pseudo random function</td>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
I 00031	One aspect of the disclosed invention provides a group key generation method jor<br>
a set of  authorized users' receivers. The method provides a component key for each possible snVtset X of receivers with fewer than k memhers, where k is a predefined constant.  An injeclive ordering function places the subsets X in a particuhir order.  For the subset of authorized receivers, the subsets X that do not contain members of the  privileged subset are tietcrmincd. The component keys associated with each such subset X are identilled. A pscudo random function that takes as inputs the component keys associated with subsets disjoint irom the privileged set with a size less than k, in the order defined by the injectivc ordering lunction, and outputs a group key.<br>
10004]	Another aspect of the disclosed invention provides a receiver with a tamper<br>
resistant environment that performs group key generation.   Ihe tamper resistant environment stores a plurality of component keys and a device II).  l-or each de\'ice. there is ;U least one stored component key corresponding to each possible subset X of whicli the de\ice is not a member, wherein the subsets X describe every set (&gt;f receivers with Icwcr than k members. I Tpon the receipt of a privileged group dellnition, the receiver's tamper resistant hardware determines if the receiver is a member of the privileged group.  If so, logic in the tamper resistant environment determines the subsets X of size less than k that do not contain members of the privileged group, these groups are ordered as determined by an injeclive ordering function.  The component keys associated with the ordered groups are applied as parameters for a pseudo random function in the order dictated by the ordering function,   the output of the pseudo random function is the privileged group key.<br><br>
overtss and on-demand programming. To facilitate this variety, content providers typically encrypt some or all of their content and only allow authorized receivers to decrypt content corresponding to the services the user purchased.<br>
I i)i) I 2 I	Consistent with the encryption system, the content providers 10 spill employ<br>
hardware anti software to encrypt at least some of the transmitted content and receivers 15 will have hardware and software to decrypt content. The receivers' hardware could be embodied in a wide variety of devices, for example, a television set top box, a mobile terminal or a general-purpose computer. 'To maintain the security of the encryption scheme, the receivers' hardware and/or software will inchile a tamper-resistant environment 16 that contains the information and logic required to participate in the encryption system, 'fhe tamper-resistant envirt&gt;nment 16 helps to ensure that users attempting to defeat the encryption system do not have access to the system's secrets. The tamper-resistant environment 16 can be embodied via any of the Systems and methods known in the art.<br>
[0013]	Management of the encrytion/decryption system, however. raises a number of<br>
difficulties.  One particular problem is the management and distribution of secret keys and algorithms used to practice the system.  As the number of system receivers or the number of discrete encryption events becomes large key management becomes daiinting.<br>
(00 1 4]	Ihe disclosed systems and methods provide for the efficient and secure<br>
generation and distribution of the keys recjuired to encrypt and decrypt content. The disclosed systems and methods allow both the content provider and authorized receivers' tampcr-rcsistant environment 16 to generate matching keys from a set of shared secret information and logic. Moreover, the disclosed system allows the content provider and the receivers' tamper-resistant environment 16 to generate matching group keys for a subset of authorized users. The defmition<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0041]	Furthermore, since numerous modifincations and variations will reavlily been to<br>
those skilled in the art, it is not desired that the present invention be limited to the exact instruction and operation illustrated and described herein. Accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents that may he resorted to are intended to fall within the scope at the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
