				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF Ti-PILLARED CLAY BASED VANADIA CATALYST<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a pillared clay based vanadia catalyst. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of vanadia based catalyst supported on titanium- pillared clay useful for producing heteroaromatic nitriles. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of pillared clay based vanadia catalyst useful for production of nicotinonitrile (3-cyanopyndine) by ammoxidation of 3-picoline and to the use thereof for the production of 3-cyanopyridine. Background of the invention<br>
The present invention finds its usage in preparing valuable intermediates for the preparation of corresponding amides, which are used in pharmaceuticals. 3-cyano-pyridine is used in the preparation of niacin, used for the treatment of pellagra. Many drugs based on niacin have curative effects such as lowering the limit of cholesterol and free fatty acids in blood, stimulaiion of the respiratory apparatus, antispasmodic and anti-rheumatic action e.g. the antispasmodic lyspamin and coramine or Nikethamide and Bilamid used in treating infections of gallbladder or bile duct.<br>
Reference is made to US Patent 5,614,453 which relates to acid catalyzed chemical conversion processes, such as hydrocarbon conversion processes, and to the catalysts and eatalyst supports used in such processes. The invention is particularly concerned with catalyst supports containing a combination of zeolite Beta and a pillared clay, catalysts comprising such supports and the use of such catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion processes, particularly hydrocracking There is no mention about conversion of 3-picoline.<br>
Reference is also made to US Patents 2,510,605, 2,839,535 and 2,861,999 wherein the catalysts based on vanadium, molybdenum and phosphorous on activated alumina has been described. However, the yields of nicotinonitrile and isonicotinonitrile were in the range of 60 to 70 %. Reference is also made to US Patent 3981879 wherein catalysts based on vanadium, molybdenum, phosphorous oxides and tin oxide over pumice have been described which gives 90% selectivity at 76% conversion.<br>
Reference is also made to Japanese Patent 19706 wherein a catalyst has been disclosed, comprising of antimony oxide, vanadium oxide containing a metal from group (iron, copper, titanium, cobalt, manganese and nickel with high selectivity but it deactivates due to reduction by ammonia.<br><br>
Pillared clays are typically prepared by reacting a smectite clay such as montmorillomte saponite. hectorite. and beidellite with a pillaring agent or propping agent to form a flocculated reaction product which is subsequently dried to convert the pillaring agent into inorganic metal oxide clusters which form the pillars which prop apart the layers ot Ihe clay. The X-ray diffraction pattern of a pillared clay normally contains a distinct first order reflection which is indicative of a well ordered, long range, face-to-face orientation of the clay platelets.<br>
Prior art search for a process for preparation of titanium based pillared clay catalyst for conversion of 3-picoline to 3-cyanopyridine has been made based on literature survey and patent databases, which did not yield any relevant references. Objects of the invention<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in providing a catalyst for conversion of 3-<br>
picoline to 3-cyanopyridine by reaction of ammonia and air with 3-picoline in a single step,<br>
yielding a high purity product, eliminating expensive oxidising agents and enabling the<br>
operation of the process on a continuous basis and the inventive step lies in providing nonobvious<br>
steps of the process in an environmental friendly manner in comparison to prior art<br>
processes.<br>
A preferred pillared clay for use in the catalyst of the invention has been pillared with<br>
polyoxymetal cations of titanium and therefore has titania clusters as the pillars between the<br>
layers. Besides a single smectite clay such as montmorillonite, mixed layered smectites such<br>
as rectorite and paragonite can also be pillared and used in the catalyst of the invention.<br>
Examples of pillared clays which possess stability at high temperatures are ones in which the<br>
pillars contain one or more rare earth elements such as cerium and/or lanthanum. Such clays<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,753,909 and 4,952,544 and in PCT International Application<br>
WO 88/06614, the disclosures of which patents and application are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties. It will be understood, however, that pillared clays in which the<br>
pillars are substantially free of rare earth elements can be used as a component of the catalyst.<br>
Pillared clays and their preparation are described generally in an article entitled "Intercalated<br>
Clay Catalysts," Science, Vol. 220, No. 4595, pp. 365-371 (Apr. 22, 1983), the disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Ti-Pillared clay: TiO2- PILC (Titanium pillared clay) was synthesized<br>
by pillaring montmorilonite /bentonite clay (sodium ion exchanged) by a solution of partially<br>
hydrolysed Ti-polycations. Ti-polycation was prepared by adding the concentrated solution<br>
of TiCU into 2 moles of HC1( Hydrochloric Acid). The mixture was then diluted by slowly<br>
adding water with constant stirring so that final concentration of Titanium in the solution was<br>
0.82 mole and final concentration of HC1 was 0.6 mole.<br>
8 g Sodium exchanged clay was dispersed in 2 litre distilled water. The slurry was<br>
stirred for 8 h by mechanical stirrer. The Titanium polycation pillaring agent was added to the<br>
slurry slowly with vigorous stirring at 90°C. The solution contained 10 m mole titanium/g<br>
clay. The resulting solution was further stirred for 4 h. The solution was kept 18 h at room<br>
temperature. The mass was filtered under suction and thoroughly washed with distilled water<br>
to make chloride ion free. The product is oven dried at 110±10°C for 6 h. Finally it was<br>
calcined at 350°C for 12 h in a muffle furnace.<br>
Preparation of Vanadyl oxalate: 45 g vanadium pentoxide in water(l:5) was heated<br>
over steam bath and 122 g oxalic acid crystals slowly added pinch wise with stirring till the<br>
colour of the slurry changes from yellow to violet blue. It was further heated over steam bath<br>
for 15 minutes. Thus the solution of vanadyl oxalate was prepared.<br>
Preparation of the catalyst and its use in ammoxidation of 3-picoline: 6.6 ml vanadyl<br>
oxalate solution containing 3.1 g vanadyl oxalate (equivalent to 1.8 g vanadium pentoxide)<br>
as prepared above was taken in a porcelain basin. It was diluted with 40 ml of distilled water,<br>
mixed thoroughly with stirring and heated at 70-80 °C. To this solution 0.05 g H3PO4 (85%)<br>
was added and mixed thoroughly. Another solution was made using 0.4 g molybdenum<br>
trioxide and 5 ml of (1:1) ammonium hydroxide and heated at 70-80°C. Both the solutions<br>
were mixed with stirring at the same temperature. 7.75 g Ti-PILC was added to the mixed<br>
solution with constant stirring. It was stirred for another 15 minutes. The mixed mass was<br>
heated on a steam bath. This was then heated in an air oven at 110°C for 15 h, then in a<br>
muffle furnace for 3 h at 300°C and further at 425°C for 15 h. The powder catalyst was<br>
pelletized and used in the form of-6 to +14 BS mesh.<br>
The reaction was carried out using a down flow, fixed bed, pyrex glass reactor of 20<br>
mm i.d.. The reactor is packed with 10 ml (8 g) Ti-PILC based catalyst. The reaction mixture<br>
was fed from top of the reactor. 3-Picoline and water in the ratio 1:3 (by vol) was fed at the<br>
rate 4.35 ml/h using a syringe pump (Sage instrument). Ammonia gas(2.1 1/h) from gas<br>
cylinder and air (4.5 1/h) through calibrated flow meter were fed in to the reactor. The<br>
reaction was carried out at temperature of 425 ± 10°C and contact time 1.4 s (space velocity<br>
2571 cc/cc cat/h). The product was cooled using ice cooled water and collected at the bottom<br>
followed by two number of ice traps. The product was analysed by gas chromatograph using<br>
2 m length carbowax 20 M column at 160°C temperature and Thermal Conductivity Detector.<br>
The yield of the product ( 3-cyanopyridine) was 80.6% where as the conversion of 3-picoline<br>
was 87.6 %<br>

stirred for 8 h by mechanical stirrer. The Titanium polycation pillaring agent was added to<br>
the slurry slowly with vigorous stirring at 90°C. The solution contained 10 m mole titanium/g<br>
clay. The resulting solution was further stirred for 4 h. The solution was kept 18 h at room<br>
temperature. The mass was filtered under suction and thoroughly washed with distilled water<br>
to make Cl" ion free. The product is oven dried at 110±10°C for 6 h. Finally it was calcined at<br>
350°C for 12 h in a muffle furnace.<br>
Preparation of Vanadyl oxalate: 45 g vanadium pentoxide in water(l:5) was heated<br>
over steam bath and 122 g oxalic acid crystals slowly added pinch wise with stirring till the<br>
colour of the slurry changes from yellow to violet blue. It was further heated over steam bath<br>
for 15 minutes. Thus the solution of vanadyl oxalate was prepared.<br>
8.9 ml vanadyl oxalate solution containing 3.1 g vanadyl oxalate (equivalent to 1.8 g<br>
vanadium pentoxide) was taken in a porcelain basin. It was diluted with 40 ml of distilled<br>
water, mixed thoroughly with stirring and heated at 70-80°C. To this solution 0.1 g HsPO^<br>
(85%) was added and mixed. Another solution was made using 0.4 g molybdenum trioxide<br>
and 5 ml of (1:1) ammonium hydroxide and heated to 70-80°C. This solution was added to<br>
the first solution with stirring keeping the temperature at about 80°C. 7.75 g Ti-PILC was<br>
added to the mixed solution with constant stirring. It was stirred for another 15 minutes. The<br>
mixed mass was evaporated on a steam bath. This was then oven dried at 110-120°C for 15 h,<br>
then calcined in a muffle furnace for 3 h at 300°C and further at 425°C for 15 h. The powder<br>
catalyst was pelletised and used in the form of-6 to +14 BS mesh.<br>
The reaction was carried out using a down flow fixed bed pyrex glass reactor of 20<br>
mm i.d. The reactor was packed with 5 ml (4.38 g) Ti-PILC based catalyst. The reaction<br>
mixture was fed from the top of the reactor 3-picoline and water in the ratio of 1:3 by vol.<br>

hydrolysed Ti-polycations. Ti-polycation was prepared by adding the concentrated solution<br>
of TiCU into 2 moles of HC1( Hydrochloric Acid). The mixture was then diluted by slowly<br>
adding water with constant stirring so that final concentration of Titanium in the solution was<br>
0.82 mole and final concentration of HC1 was 0.6 mole.<br>
8 g Sodium exchanged clay was dispersed in 2 litre distilled water. The slurry was<br>
stirred for 8 h by mechanical stirrer. The Titanium polycation pillaring agent was added to<br>
the slurry slowly with vigorous stirring at 90°C. The solution contained 10 m mole titanium/g<br>
clay. The resulting solution was further stirred for 4 h. The solution was kept 18 h at room<br>
temperature. The mass was filtered under suction and thoroughly washed with distilled water<br>
to make Cl" ion free. The product is oven dried at 110±10°C for 6 h. Finally it was calcined at<br>
350°C for 12 h in a muffle furnace.<br>
Preparation of Vanadyl oxalate: 45 g vanadium pentoxide in water(l:5) was heated<br>
over steam bath and 122 g oxalic acid crystals slowly added pinch wise with stirring till the<br>
colour of the slurry changes from yellow to violet blue. It was further heated over steam bath<br>
for 15 minutes. Thus the solution of vanadyl oxalate was prepared.<br>
Solution A was prepared by diluting 18 ml vanadyl oxalate solution containing 9.35 g<br>
vanadyl oxalate(equivalent to 5.49 g vanadium pentoxide) with 75 g distilled water and 0.95<br>
g H3PO4 (85%) was added and mixed. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 17.6 g<br>
ammonium hepta molybdate in 65 g distilled water. Both solutions were heated at 70-80 °C,<br>
solution A was added to solution B and 10.5 g Ti-pillared clay was added and mixed<br>
thoroughly. This mixed mass was then heated over steam bath till the mass reduced to about<br>
half. Semi dried mass of the catalyst was then oven dried at 110-120 °C for 15 h and then<br>
calcined at 300 °C for 3 hours and further at 400-425 °C for 15 h. This was then pelletised (6<br>
mm dia) and sized to -6+14 mesh size.<br>
The reaction was carried out using a down flow, fixed bed, pyrex glass reactor of 20<br>
mm I.D. The reactor was packed with 8.8 ml (13.2 g) Ti-PILC based catalyst. The reaction<br>
mixtures, 3-Picoline and water in the ratio 1:3 (by vol.) was fed at the rate 6.0 ml/h using a<br>
syringe pump (sage instrument). Ammonia gas (2.4 1/h) from gas cylinder and air (4.5 1/h)<br>
through calibrated flow meter were fed in to the reactor. The reaction was carried out at<br>
temperature of 430 ± 10°C and contact time 1.05. The product was cooled using ice cooled<br>
water and collected at the bottom followed by two number of ice traps. The product was<br>
analysed by gas chromatograph using 2 m length carbowax 20 M column at 160°C<br>
temperature and Thermal Conductivity Detector. The yield of 3- cyanopyridine obtained was<br>
93.0 % the conversion 96.1 %.<br>
