Aryloxypropylamines are an important class of pharmaceutical products used in<br>
the care of attention-deficit disorder and hyperactivity disturbances.<br>
Some of the most important products belonging to this class are the following:<br>
O'<br>
H<br>
(VI)<br>
Fluoxetine - formula VI<br>
(VII)<br>
Atomoxetine -formula VII O. O'<br>
N' H <br>
Nisoxetine - formula VIII<br>
Duloxetine is a chemically very similar product having the following formula:<br>
It is used as drug for the care of depression and incontinence.<br>
The known synthesis paths for obtaining this product type starting from the<br>
corresponding amino alcohol can be divided into two groups:<br>
A) Aromatic nucleophilic substitution processes like those described in<br>
W02000290239.<br>
This kind of process provides for the substitution of a halogen atom on the ring by the OH of the amino alcohol of formula II, suitably activated as an alcoholate. This process type is applicable with good results only when electron-attractor groups are present on the aromatic ring which bears the halogen to be substituted (in the diagram below, when A and X have the meanings defmed above and Y' is an electron-attractor group).<br>
OH<br>
(II)	(X)	(XI)<br>
B) Nucleophilic substitution reactions of the hydroxyl of the amino alcohol. (see for example US4018895 and US4314081).<br>
This kind of process normally provides for the following reaction sequence: a) protection of the amino group; <br>
<br>
b)	activation of the hydroxyl by means of its transformation into a good leavingt group (preferably a halogen);<br>
c)	nucleophilic substitution with the appropriate aryloxy, optionally substituted;<br>

(XIII)<br>
The processes of this type are longer but have a much wider ränge of application. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Düring the study of the synthesis of aryloxy and heteroaryloxy propylamine we surprisingly found that if in the processes of B type the order of the amino group protection and hydroxyl activation stages is reversed, greater overall yields are obtained. Moreover, taking into consideration that the activation of the hydroxyl is generally carried out in an acidic environment, reversing the two reaction stages permits using protective groups of the amino group which are not compatible with acidic environments.<br>
The reaction sequence of the present invention is therefore the following: a) activation of the hydroxyl of an amino alcohol of formula II by means of its substitution with a halogen atom, preferably by means of reaction with a suitable halogenating agent (for example of the type SOX2, PX3, POX3, etc., where X <br>
<br>
indicates a halogen), to obtain the salified amino halogen-derivative of formula III.<br>
A	y	A	y<br>
(II)	(III)<br>
This reaction is carried out in a halogenated solvent, preferably methylene Chloride, at a temperature in the ränge of 0 °C - 40 °C, preferably in the ränge of 20 °C - 25 °C. The quantity of halogenating agent, preferably thionyl chloride, is in the ränge of 0.8 - 3 equivalents with respect to the starting amino alcohol, preferably in the ränge of 1 - 2 equivalents. The reaction time is in the ränge of 1 - 4 hours, preferably in the ränge of 1 - 2 hours.<br>
b) protection of the amino group of the amino halogen-derivative of formula III, to obtain the protected amino halogen-derivative of formula IV.<br>
G<br>
(III)	(IV)<br>
where G is an amino protecting group.<br>
The methods for protecting amines are well known in the art and are described for example in Greene et al., Protective Croups in Organic Synthesis, chapter 7, Third Edition, 1999, Wiley-Interscience, pages 494-653, incorporated here for reference.<br>
HX<br>
Preferably, G indicates a protector group of the amino group, preferably of formula R-C(=0)- where R is an alkyl residue, ptionally substituted, aryl or alkoxy residue, or of formula R'-S(==0)2- where R' indicates an alkyl, optionally substituted, alkyl residue or aryl residue. <br>
<br>
The protection reaction is carried out in a halogenated solvent, preferably methylene chloride, and water, (in ratios in the ränge of 0.5 - 1.5 to 1, preferably 0.75 to 1) at a temperature in the ränge of 0 °C - 30 °C, preferably in the ränge of 5 °C - 10°C, and in the presence of a base. The quantity of protective agent, which can be an activated derivative of an acyl, preferably an acetyl or a benzoyl, of a sulfonyl, preferably a tosyl, or of an oxyformyl, preferably a benzyloxyformyl or an ethoxyformyl, is in the ränge of 0.8 - 3 equivalents with respect to the starting amino halogen-derivative, preferably in the ränge of 1 - 2 equivalents. The quantity of base, preferably NaOH, is in the ränge of 1 - 4 equivalents with respect to the starting amino halogen-derivative, preferably in the ränge of 2 - 3 equivalents. The reaction time is in the ränge of 1 - 4 hours, preferably 1 - 2 hours. c) substitution of the halogen of the protected amino halogen-derivative of formula IV with the appropriate aryloxy, so to obtain the protected aryloxypropylamine (or heteroaryloxypropylamine) of formula XIII.<br>
A ^ r^<br>
G<br>
(IV)	(XIII)<br>
This reaction is carried out in an ether solvent, preferably polar, still more preferably tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature in the ränge of 25 °C - 65 °C, preferably 50 °C - 65 °C. The quantity of aryloxy, preferably obtained from o- cresol by means of a base, is in the ränge of 1 - 5 equivalents with respect to the starting protected amino halogen-derivative, preferably in the ränge of 2 - 4 equivalents. The quantity of base, preferably KOH, is in the ränge of 1 - 5 equivalents with respect to the starting protected amino halogen-derivative, preferably in the ränge of 2 - 4 equivalents. The reaction time is in the ränge of 5 - 20 hours, preferably in the ränge of 10 - 12 hours.<br>
d) Deprotection of the formula Compounds (XIII) to obtain the ary-loxypropanolamine or heteroaryloxypropylamine of the invention, of formula (XI).<br>
A - N	A<br>
(XIII)	(XI)<br>
The deprotection reaction type to be used varies in relation to the protective group and is well known in the art (see Greene et al. above). In the case of amides or carbamates, hydrolysis reactions in basic environment are used. If the carbamate is a benzylcarbamate, catalytic hydrogenolysis reactions are preferably utilised for the deprotection. Such hydrogenolysis reactions can be conducted with hydrogen, formic acid, ammonium formate, tertiary amine salts with formic acid or mixtures of formic acid and its salts.<br>

not be considered as limiting the object of the invention.<br>
