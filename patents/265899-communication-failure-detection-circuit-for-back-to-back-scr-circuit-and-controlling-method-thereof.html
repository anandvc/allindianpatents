				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back<br>
connected silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) circuit. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit<br>
having relatively better efficiency.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Using back-to-back connected SCRs as a static switch in between an AC power supply and<br>
a load is quite common nowadays. For example, please refer to Fig. 1, it shows a<br>
schematic circuit diagram of a conventional tap changing transformer including six pairs of<br>
back-to-back SCRs (SCR1 to SCR6) for line voltage regulation (with input supply:<br>
240-520V and output supply: 220 +/- 10% V). In which, each pair of the back-to-back<br>
SCRs has a first terminal (kl(l) to kl(6)) and a second terminal (k2(l) to k2(6), and each of<br>
the SCRs has a gate (Gl(l) to Gl(6) and G2(l) to G2(6)). In such an application of SCRs,<br>
a commutation failure detection circuit is required to avoid a dramatic damage to the<br>
transformer caused by a malfunction of the SCRs.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 2, which shows a block diagram of a conventional commutation failure<br>
detection circuit using bridge and opto-coupler for a back-to-back SCR circuit. In which, it<br>
shows a back-to-back SCR circuit and the failure detection circuit including a resistor bank<br>
coupled to the back-to-back SCR circuit, a full-bridge circuit coupled to the resistor bank<br>
and the back-to-back SCR circuit, and an opto isolator having an opto-coupler (not shown)<br>
coupled to the full-bridge circuit, receiving a DC supply and outputting an output.<br>
Assume that the first SCR of a SCR pair of the back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) is<br>
triggered at some firing angle in a positive half cycle of an AC input voltage (not shown) of<br>
the back-to-back SCR circuit. A forward voltage is present across the SCR pair until any<br>
one of the SCR starts conducting. This forward voltage is applied to the full-bridge<br>
rectifier through the resistor bank. The resistor bank serves the purpose of limiting the<br>
current flowing into the full-bridge circuit. The rectified voltage turns on a light emitting<br>
diode (not shown) in the opto-coupler and this signal is transmitted to the output.<br>
2<br><br>
When any one of the SCR pair starts conducting, the voltage across the opto-diode is zero.<br>
Therefore, there is no signal on the opto-coupler output. A similar operation follows in the<br>
negative half cycle of the AC input voltage.<br>
The advantages of the aforementioned conventional failure detection circuit using bridge<br>
and opto-coupler are that the components count of which is relatively low. And the<br>
disadvantages of the aforementioned conventional failure detection circuit using bridge and<br>
opto-coupler are that the total applied voltage is dropped across the series-connected resistor<br>
bank around the zero crossing of the AC input voltage. Therefore, a forward current<br>
available to turn on the full-bridge including four diodes builds up slowly. Thus, there is<br>
always some delay present in commutation failure detection of the SCR.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 3, which shows a block diagram of a conventional commutation failure<br>
detection circuit using opto-couplers for a back-to-back SCR circuit. In which, it shows a<br>
back-to-back SCR circuit and the failure detection circuit including a resistor bank coupled<br>
to the back-to-back SCR circuit and two opto isolators each having an opto-coupler (not<br>
shown) and outputting an output, one opto isolator is coupled to the resistor bank, and the<br>
other is coupled to the back-to-back SCR circuit and receives a DC supply voltage.<br>
Assume that the first SCR of a SCR pair of the back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) is<br>
triggered at some firing angle in the positive half cycle of the AC input voltage (not shown)<br>
of the back-to-back SCR circuit. The forward voltage is present across the SCR pair until<br>
any one of the SCR starts conducting. A maximum voltage drop appears across the series<br>
resistor bank, which serves to limit the current flowing into the opto-couplers. One<br>
opto-coupler is connected in reverse direction to allow conduction during a negative<br>
half-cycle of the AC input voltage. An input voltage of each of the opto-couplers turns on<br>
an opto-diode (not shown) presents in each of the opto-couplers and transmits a signal to the<br>
opto-coupler output.<br>
When any one of the SCR pair starts conducting, the voltage across the opto-diode is zero.<br>
Therefore, there is no signal at the opto-coupler output. A similar operation follows in the<br>
negative half cycle of the AC input voltage.<br>
The advantages of the above-mentioned conventional failure detection circuit using<br>
opto-couplers are that the components count of which is also relatively low. But the<br>
disadvantages of the above-mentioned conventional failure detection circuit using<br>
opto-couplers are that the total applied voltage is dropped across the series-connected<br>
3<br><br>
resistor bank around the zero crossing of the AC input voltage. Therefore, the forward<br>
current available to turn on the opto-diodes builds up slowly. Thus, there is always some<br>
delay present in commutation failure detection of the SCR.<br>
Keeping the drawbacks of the prior arts in mind, the applicant proposes a commutation<br>
failure detection circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit and the controlling methods thereof<br>
having relatively better efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a commutation failure detection<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Please refer to Fig. 4, which shows a circuit diagram of a commutation failure detection<br>
circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit according to the first preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The provided commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back<br>
SCR circuit according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention 1 includes<br>
a first detecting signal generator coupled to a cathode of a first SCR of a SCR pair of the<br>
back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) at connector K2 for detecting a commutation at a<br>
negative half cycle of an AC input voltage and including a first non-conductive signal<br>
14<br><br>
amplifier circuit 11 for generating a first non-conductive signal when the back-to-back<br>
SCR circuit is not conductive at the negative half cycle of the AC input voltage, a first<br>
non-conductive signal driver 13 for receiving and transferring the first non-conductive<br>
signal, and a first non-conductive signal isolator including a first opto-coupler Ul and a<br>
resistor R9 for receiving the transferred first non-conductive signal and generating a first<br>
commutation detecting signal at a logic high status when the first non-conductive signal is<br>
absent, a second detecting signal generator coupled to the cathode of the second SCR of the<br>
back-to-back SCR circuit at connector K1 for detecting the commutation at a positive half<br>
cycle of the AC input voltage and including a second non-conductive signal amplifier<br>
circuit 12 for generating a second non-conductive signal when the back-to-back SCR<br>
circuit is not conductive at the positive half cycle of the AC input voltage, a second<br>
non-conductive signal driver 14 for receiving and transferring the second non-conductive<br>
signal and a second non-conductive signal isolator including a second opto-coupler U2 and<br>
a resistor R l8 for receiving the transferred second non-conductive signal and generating a<br>
second commutation detecting signal at the logic high status when the second<br>
non-conductive signal is absent, and an output node (connected to the connector "To<br>
Micro") coupled to the first and the second non-conductive signal isolators for outputting<br>
one of the first and the second commutation detecting signals.<br>
In which, the first non-conductive signal amplifier circuit 11 includes a signal bias resistor<br>
R4, a detection current limiting resistor R5, a reverse blocking diode D3 and a signal<br>
amplifier 111 including a first stage having a transistor T1 and a resistor Rl1, and a second<br>
stage having a transistor T3 and a resistor R10. The second non-conductive signal<br>
amplifier circuit 12 includes a signal bias resistor R13, a detection current limiting resistor<br>
R14, a reverse blocking diode D5 and a signal amplifier 121 including a first stage having a<br>
transistor T5 and a resistor R20, and a second stage having a transistor T7 and a resistor<br>
R19. The first non-conductive signal driver 13 includes a zener diode D4 (which is an<br>
option and could be omitted in a different preferred embodiment), a resistor R12, a<br>
transistor T4, a resistor R6, a resistor R7, a transistor T2, and a resistor R8. And the<br>
second non-conductive signal driver 14 includes a zener diode D6 (which is also an option<br>
and could be omitted in another preferred embodiment), a resistor R21, a transistor T8, a<br>
resistor R15, a resistor R16, a transistor T6, and a resistor R17.<br>
Assume that the first SCR of the SCR pair of the back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) is<br>
triggered at some firing angle in the positive half cycle of the AC input voltage (not shown)<br>
of the back-to-back SCR circuit. Then a forward voltage is present across the SCR pair<br>
until any one of the SCR pair starts conducting.<br>
15<br><br>
During the positive half cycle, a potential voltage at terminal K2 is grater than that of K1.<br>
This positive potential turns the transistor T5 on which then biases the transistor T7 on.<br>
Therefore, the total voltage is applied across the parallel combination of resistors R14, R19<br>
and R20, and the collector of the transistor T7 is pulled down to ground. During this period,<br>
the transistor T8 is off. The opto-diode of U2 conducts through the transistor T6, which<br>
switches the opto-coupler (U2) output to logic low.<br>
During the SCR conducting period, a potential difference between the terminals K2 &amp; Kl is<br>
equal to the SCR forward voltage drop. This voltage is very small, so the transistors T5 &amp;<br>
T7 are switched off. A DC supply (Vcc2, +5V) drives the transistor T8 on and turns the<br>
transistor T6 off. Therefore, opto-diode of U2 is open-circuited during this period and its<br>
output is logical high.<br>
During a negative half cycle of the AC input voltage, a similar analysis is valid for the upper<br>
half of the commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit according to<br>
the first preferred embodiment of the present invention 1 (with a DC supply of Vcc1, +5V).<br>
In this circuit, the blocking voltage during SCR off condition is used to drive one transistor<br>
on which in turn amplifies the signal to turn on the second stage transistor. Therefore, the<br>
current flowing through the current limiting resistors is not directly involved to get the<br>
commutation information. As a result, the commutation of the SCR can be sensed with<br>
very little delay.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 5, which shows a circuit diagram of a commutation failure detection<br>
circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit according to the second preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The provided commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back<br>
SCR circuit according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention 2<br>
includes a first detecting signal generator coupled to the cathode of the first SCR of the<br>
back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) at connector K2 for detecting a commutation at a<br>
negative half cycle of an AC input voltage and including a first non-conductive signal<br>
amplifier circuit 21 for generating a first non-conductive signal when the back-to-back<br>
SCR circuit is not conductive at the negative half cycle of the AC input voltage, a first<br>
non-conductive signal driver 13 for receiving and transferring the first non-conductive<br>
signal, and a first non-conductive signal isolator including a first opto-coupler U1 and a<br>
resistor R9 for receiving the transferred first non-conductive signal and generating a first<br>
commutation detecting signal at a logic high status when the first non-conductive signal is<br>
16<br><br>
absent, a second detecting signal generator coupled to the cathode of the second SCR of the<br>
back-to-back SCR circuit at connector Kl for detecting the commutation at a positive half<br>
cycle of the AC input voltage and including a second non-conductive signal amplifier<br>
circuit 22 for generating a second non-conductive signal when the back-to-back SCR<br>
circuit is not conductive at the positive half cycle of the AC input voltage, a second<br>
non-conductive signal driver 14 for receiving and transferring the second non-conductive<br>
signal and a second non-conductive signal isolator including a second opto-coupler U2 and<br>
a resistor R18 for receiving the transferred second non-conductive signal and generating a<br>
second commutation detecting signal at the logic high status when the second<br>
non-conductive signal is absent, and an output node (connected to the connector "To<br>
Micro") coupled to the first and the second non-conductive signal isolators for outputting<br>
one of the first and the second commutation detecting signals.<br>
In Fig. 5, the first non-conductive signal amplifier circuit 21 includes a signal bias resistor<br>
R4, a detection current limiting resistor R5, a reverse blocking diode D3 and a signal<br>
amplifier including a diode Dl. The second non-conductive signal amplifier circuit 22<br>
includes a signal bias resistor R13, a detection current limiting resistor R14, a reverse<br>
blocking diode D5 and a signal amplifier including a diode D2. The first non-conductive<br>
signal driver 13 and the second non-conductive signal driver 14 are the same as those of<br>
Fig. 4.<br>
Also assume that the first SCR of a SCR pair of the back-to-back SCR circuit (not shown) is<br>
triggered at some firing angle in the positive half cycle of the AC input voltage (not shown)<br>
of the back-to-back SCR circuit. Then a forward voltage is present across the SCR pair<br>
until any one of the SCR pair starts conducting.<br>
During the positive half cycle, the potential voltage at terminal K2 is grater than that of Kl.<br>
This positive potential turns the diode D2 on. Therefore, the total voltage is applied across<br>
the resistor R14. During this period, the transistor T8 is off. The opto-diode of U2<br>
conducts through the transistor T6, which switches the opto-coupler (U2) output to logic<br>
low.<br>
During the SCR conducting period, a potential difference between the terminals K2 &amp; Kl is<br>
equal to the SCR forward voltage drop. This voltage is very small, so the diode D2 is<br>
switched off. A DC supply (Vcc2, +5V) drives the transistor T8 on and turns the transistor<br>
T6 off. Therefore, opto-diode of U2 is open-circuited during this period and its output is<br>
logical high.<br>
17<br><br>
During a negative half cycle of the AC voltage, a similar analysis is also valid for the upper<br>
half of the commutation failure detection circuit for a back-to-back SCR circuit according to<br>
the second preferred embodiment of the present invention 2 (with a DC supply of Vcc1,<br>
+5V).<br>
Basically, the commutation failure detection circuit according to the second preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention 2 has a relatively simpler configuration than the<br>
commutation failure detection circuit according to the first preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention 1 since the signal amplifiers 111 and 121 are replaced by diodes Dl and<br>
D2. But the delay at zero current cross of the commutation failure detection circuit<br>
according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention 2 is relatively a little<br>
bit longer than that of the commutation failure detection circuit according to the first<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention 1.<br>
To show this, a test is conducted on a single SCR with a load of 60W incandescent bulb +<br>
40W fluorescent tube and the I/P Voltage is 240V AC. Please refer to Fig. 6, which shows<br>
a waveform diagram of voltage across SCR, current flowing through SCR and control<br>
signal at the collector of T7 as that of Fig. 4 vs. time according to the first preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention respectively. In Fig. 7, it shows a waveform diagram<br>
of voltage across SCR, current flowing through SCR and control signal at the cathode of D2<br>
as that of Fig. 5 vs. time according to the second preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention respectively. Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, Ch1 represents the waveform of voltage<br>
across SCR, Ch2 represents the waveform of current flowing through SCR, and Ch3<br>
represents the waveform of control signal at the collector of T7 or cathode of D2 as those of<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. In Fig. 7, there is a relatively more significant delay between<br>
current zero cross and the control single being triggered. In Fig. 6, however, the delay is<br>
relatively much more insignificant.<br>
In conclusion, the provided commutation failure detection circuit and the controlling<br>
method thereof have the advantages of minimizing the delay present in commutation failure<br>
detection of the back-to-back SCR circuit.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the<br>
most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention need not<br>
be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various<br>
