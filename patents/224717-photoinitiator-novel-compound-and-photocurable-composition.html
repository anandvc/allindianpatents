				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PHOTOINITIATOR, NOVEL COMPOUND, AND PHOTOCURABLE COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to photoinitiators, a novel<br>
compound, and photocurable compositions including a<br>
photoinitiator. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to photoinitiators which are usable in thick-layer UV<br>
curable coatings.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, photoinitiators are gaining in<br>
importance in the field of UV-light and daylight curable resin<br>
compositions, such as photocurable coatings or photocurable<br>
printing inks, which may be applicable to a wide range of<br>
substrates including metal, paper, plastics and wood, since<br>
the photoinitiators can drastically increase curing rate.<br>
In this field, highly sensitive photoinitiators are<br>
desired, which are capable of absorbing enough UV or daylight,<br>
and producing radicals that start polymerization or<br>
transferring the absorbed energy to polymerizable substances<br>
for formation of radicals.<br>
Conventionally, photoinitiators have been repeatedly<br>
studied so far with the aim of enhancing sensitivity, and<br>
improving inherent technical problems such as yellowing. In<br>
order to overcome these general problems, for example,<br>
alkylphenylbisacrylphosphine oxides, and photoinitiator<br>
mixtures of an alkylphenylbisacrylphosphine oxide with<br>
benzophenone are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,020,528.<br>
The conventional photoinitiators, such as<br>
alkylphenylbisacylphosphine oxides exhibit a good curability,<br>
particularly when used in thin layer photocurable coatings.<br>
However, the photoinitiators are difficult to use for UV<br>
curing of coatings having a greater layer thickness. This is<br>
because the self-absorption of the photoinitiator molecule<br>
containing aromatic structure elements is large.<br>
Furthermore, the photoinitiators of the<br>
alkylphenylbisacylphosphine oxide type exhibit an improved<br>
yellowing behavior in comparison with other conventional<br>
photoinitiators (e.g., benzophenone). However, the problem of<br>
yellowing has not been completely solved thus far. Therefore,<br>
there is a strong need for a photoinitiator showing<br>
significant improvement regarding yellowing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a<br>
photoinitiator which exhibits excellent photosensitivity,<br>
yields colorless products, and is also usable in thick layer<br>

substituents is the alkyl group 2), and<br>
mass percentage of a chemical structure element<br>
represented by the following formula (2),<br>
which is expressed in formula (1), based on the total<br>
molecular weight of the compound having the chemical structure<br>
represented by formula (1), is within the range of 17% to 54%.<br>
The present invention also provides a photoinitiator<br>
consisting essentially of a compound having a molecular weight<br>

(ii) a radical curable ethylenic unsaturated compound<br>
An amount of the photoinitiator among the photocurable<br>
composition is preferably within the range of 1 to 15 percent<br>

In order to prevent inhibition of polymerization by<br>
) oxygen, a waxy compound can be added in addition to the above<br>
components. In consequence of their appropriate solubility in<br>
the mixtures, they float on top of the mixture at the start of<br>
polymerization and form a thin protecting layer between<br>
atmospheric oxygen and the polymerizing mixture.<br>
5 Additionally, auto-oxidizing compounds like allyl ethers can<br>
be added that prevent inhibition of polymerization by oxygen<br>
in some cases.<br>

as a phthalate.<br>
The photocurable composition according to this invention<br>
can be obtained by mixing the foregoing respective components<br>
uniformly, and can be cured by high-energy rays, preferably<br>
ultraviolet rays.<br>
As radiation sources, sunlight or artificial irradiation<br>
generated by commercial mercury high-, medium- or low-pressure<br>
lamps, or xenon or wolfram lamps, can be used. The wavelength<br>
of the applied irradiation is within a range of 200 to 500 nm,<br>
preferably 250 to 350 nm. Duration of exposure depends on<br>
amount and type of the used photoinitiator and can be selected<br>

(Properties of Cured Coatings)<br>
The following table shows properties of various cured<br>
coatings of photocurable compositions which contain<br>
photinitiators from the above-mentioned examples.<br>
Fist of all, photocurable compositions were prepared by<br>
mixing the composition in the table, then coated on aluminum<br>
sheets as thin films and cured by UV irradiation.<br>
The cured coatings were tested with respect to their<br>
pencil hardness and their solvent resistance towards ethyl<br>
methyl ketone.<br>
The photoactivity of all prepared photoinitiators was<br>
tested.<br>
For UV-curing tests, a mixture consisting of 30 weight-%<br>
tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA), 25 weight-%<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and 45 weight-% Ebecryl<br>
150 (UCB) was used. A solution of 5 weight-% of the tested<br>
photoinitiator in the UV-curable mixture was prepared and<br>
coated on an aluminum sheet as a film of 50 urn thickness. The<br>
sample was irradiated with a Fusion F 300 using the H-bulb<br>
(300 W/inch). The radiation doses were 0.087 J/cm2 for UV-A,<br>
0.058 J/cm2 for UV-B and 0.035 J/cm2 for UV-C, which gives 180<br>
mJ/cm2 in sum. The belt-speed was adjusted to 16 m/min and 3<br>
passes were done.<br>
All tested photoinitiators of the invention are<br>
photoactive and initiate a polymerization under irradiation,<br>
indicated by the formation of solvent-resistant films. The<br>
solvent resistance of the cured film was tested by rubbing the<br>
film with a cotton sheet soaked with 2-butanone (methyl ethyl<br>
ketone; MEK) and counting the double rubs needed to cause<br>
visible defects in the film. The results are summarized in<br>
the following table:<br>
a) a test mixture consisting of 29% dIpropylene glycol<br>
diacrylate (DPGDA), 42% Ebecryl 150 and 24% TMPTA was used<br>
b) a solution of 4 weight-% of the photoinitiator in a mixture<br>
of 20% deionized water and 76% Photomer 3165 (Cognis) was<br>
tested<br>
c) 10 weight-% of dimethyl sulfoxide were added to the test<br>
mixture in order to dissolve the photoinitiator<br>
As a reference, a film of the same thickness was coated<br>
on the same sheet consisting of the UV-curable mixture,<br>
however, without a photoinitiator of the present invention.<br>
This film showed no curing and was easily removed by whipping<br>
with a dry cotton sheet.<br>
Also, the influence of the molecular weight of the<br>
photoinitiators on their photoactivity was investigated.<br>

test mixture. The test mixture was applied<br>
on an aluminum substrate at a film thickness<br>
of 50 µm (wet) and cured under UV-light with<br>
a Fusion F 300 H bulb. The applied<br>
irradiance was 0.5 J/cm2. Then, the coatings<br>
were assessed by appearance, solvent<br>
resistance and hardness.<br>

measured.<br>
(properties comparison with conventional phoinitiators)<br>
Due to the low molar extinction coefficient,<br>
photoinitiators of the present invention are particularly<br>
suitable for curing of thick coatings layers, which was<br>
demonstrated by the following experiment:<br>
A container, having dimensions of 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm, was<br>
filled with a test mixture, containing 30% of<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate, 30% of bisphenol-A-<br>
diglycidylether diacrylate, 35% of dipropylene glycol<br>
diacrylate and 5% of 5,5-diacetylnonane-2,8-dione (a<br>
photoinitiator according to Example 19 of the present<br>
invention). Then, the container was irradiated from above<br>
with a Fusion F300 H bulb (Irradiance &gt; 0.25 J/cm2) . After the<br>
curing process, the content of the container, which contains a<br>
cured thick layer on top and uncured liquid material beneath,<br>
was removed, and the thickness of the cured top layer was<br>
measured by a micrometer screw. Thickness of the cured layer:<br>
800 µm.<br>
