				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a built-in packing for the material exchange and/or heat exchange between gases and liquids.<br>
Such a built-in packing is arranged with several other built-in packings in, for example, a wet cooling tower in such a way that the water to be cooled can flow through the built-in packings from the top downwards and cooling air can flow through them in cross-and/or counter-current.<br>
In this connection various built-in packings are known made from corrugated pate- or foil-like built-in elements, which are explained in the DE-PS 23 22 683. All these built-in elements have closed surfaces over which the water to be cooled flows down in thin layers. To interrupt a stream or thread formation tendency it is also known in this connection to provide holes or projections, which may be arranged in or on the surfaces or also in the corner areas of the corrugations.<br>
Irrespective of how the channels formed by the corrugations extend, horizontally, vertically or at a slant, in principle always closed layers of water<br>
are in heat-exchange contact with the cooling air. This necessarily limits the heat exchange capacity.<br>
Another property of the known types is that they are sensitive to dirt. A cleaning of the built-in elements in the assembled state is hardly possible.<br>
Furthermore, within the scope of the DE 41 11 451 C2 built-in trickling elements in the form of tubular bodies have become known, which are assembled into pack-like elements. The tubular bodies are cut off, with a length corresponding to the element height or element width, from a continuously produced, tubular grating body formed by strands that cross one another, wherein the grating bodies that are in contact with one another are fastened to one another at least at their end faces.<br>
Also with these built-in trickling elements the helical strands guide the water flowing down them. The individual nodal points of the strands serve to ensure a continuous splitting up and bringing back together of the individual bands of water that flow down them.<br>
It is the object of the invention, proceeding from the state of the art, to create a built-in packing for the mass and/or heat exchange between gases and liquids, which at a high heat exchange capacity is insensitive to dirt and can easily be manufactured and installed.<br>
This object can be achieved by the inventive steps of the instant invention.<br>
The novel feature of the invention is the construction of identical grating-like built-in elements in filigree configuration. As a result of the channels formed by the corrugations, extending at an angle to the vertical and provided with large openings, which with the two adjoining built-in elements that, however, are<br>
arranged turned by 180째 around a vertical axis, cross one another, in principle no surfaces are present any more over which the water to be cooled, e.g. in a wet cooling" tower, can flow down in layers or layers bands. On the contrary, due to the filigree structure of the built-in elements and the grating of a built-in packing formed as a result thereof, every drop of water falling down from the water distribution in the area of the upper edge strip, when it falls on the edge strips, the longitudinal struts and the cross-webs, is split into many small water droplets which are then again flung against one another as well as against the longitudinal struts and the cross-webs, as a result of which their volume is reduced to such an extent that in the built-in packing a kind of mist-like fluid bed is formed which is carried by the cooling air. In this way a very large heat exchange surface is created, which then also results in a high heat exchange capacity.<br>
The filigree structure of the built-in elements has the further advantage that the<br>
built-in packing made from same is insensitive to dirt and moreover even in the<br>
installed state can be cleaned by high-pressure water jets. In this connection the<br><br>
longitudinal struts extending into the bottom part of the channels and each of which is in contact with the longitudinal struts of the adjoining built-in elements, together with the contact plates forming the end components of the two edge strips and the cross-webs provide the required rigidity, Two adjoining built-in elements are also connected to one another by the contact plates.<br>
the channels of the built-in elements <br>
can extend at an angle of 10째 to 80째 to the vertical. However, from a <br>
manufacturing point of view it is advantageous when the channels extend at an angle of 30째 to the vertical.<br>
the rigidity of every built-in element as well as the mist-like turbulence of the water that trickles down, desired in particular in a wet cooling tower with the object of obtaining a large heat exchange<br>
surface, is improved further. By the diagonal webs, between two nodal points positioned above one another of two adjoining longitudinal struts and cross-webs, further cross-like struts are created. These struts formed by the diagonal webs together with the cross-webs then form to a certain extent the filigree walls of the channels between the longitudinal struts.<br>
The configuration of the cross and diagonal webs contributes to an increase in the rigidity of every built-in element, without however adversely affecting the filigree structure. This moreover serves to facilitate the manufacture, in particular during the injection moulding of the built-in elements.<br>
The longitudinal struts, the cros-webs as well as the diagonal webs may have a round cross-section.<br>
However, with regard to the longitudinal webs it is advantageous-<br>
when these have a rectangular cross-section. The greater cross-sectional<br>
length then extends cross-wise to the longitudinal direction of the longitudinal<br>
struts. <br><br>
the cross-webs advantageously have a square cross-section. They are also thinner than the longitudinal struts.<br>
With regard to the diagonal webs, it is particularly advantageous when these have a wedge-shaped cross-section. This is also advantageous for the manufacture of the built-in elements by the injection moulding process.<br>
The contact plates in the top and bottom edge strip of a built-in element, which serve to connect two adjoining built-in elements, have a rectangular configuration, wherein their longitudinal axes extend in the vertical.<br>
Such an arrangement ensures that the front surfaces of the contact plates can be used as the contact area of two built-in elements,<br>
the contact plates are connected not only to the longitudinal struts, but also to one another by means of horizontal connecting webs. These connecting webs preferably extend in the area of the top and bottom transverse edges, respectively, of the contact plates. In this way the top edge of the top edge strip and the bottom edge of the bottom edge strip are formed by the free transverse edges of the contact plates as well as by the free 1 front edges of the connecting webs. <br>
A further reinforcing of the edge strips is obtained. <br>
This construction furthermore contributes to that the vertically extending areas of the edge strips can be injection moulded with the areas of the channels.<br>
So that also in the middle height zone of the built-in elements additional connecting areas can be created between two adjoining built-in elements, the nodal points of the longitudinal struts with die cross-webs and optionally also with the diagonal webs, located in the middle height zone, are enlarged to form support surfaces.<br>
Seeing that in the preferred embodiment the built-in elements are made of plastic, two adjoining built-in elements are welded together by way of the contact plates. In this case also the support surfaces are preferably welded together.<br>
Another embodiment of the connection of two built-in elements can be noted According to this two adjoining built-in elements are mortised to gether by way of the contact plates. To this end the contact plates that follow one another in the edge strips may be provided once<br>
with a tenon and once with a recess adapted to same. Also the support surfaces in the middle height zone of the built-in elements can be constructed in this way.<br>
So that the built-in elements can be manufactured expediently by the injection moulding process as mass-produced articles, <br>
the built-in elements are made of polyethylene (PE), in particular high density polyethylene (HDPE).<br>
built-in elements may,<br>
however, also be made of polypropylene.<br>
In the following the invention will be explained in greater detail with reference , to exemplified embodiments illustrated in the drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a cut-out of a built-in packing for a wet cooling tower;<br>
Figure 2 shows on a larger scale a diagrammatic frontal view of a built-in element of the built-in packing according to Figure 1;<br>
+<br>
Figure 3 shows on an even larger scale the cut-out III of Figure 2; Figure 4 shows also on a larger scale the cut-out IV of Figure 2;<br>
Figure 5 is an enlarged exploded view of the cut-outs of two adjoining built-in elements;<br>
Figure 6 shows on a larger scale a cut-out top view onto the illustration of Figure 2 according to the arrow VI and<br>
Figure 7 shows, also on a larger scale, a cut-out top view onto the illustration<br>
In Figure 1 the reference numeral 1 indicates a built-in packing for a wet cooling tower, which itself is not shown. This built-in packing 1 consist of several corrugated, grating-like built-in elements 2 of an injected moulded high density polyethylene (HDPE), arranged next to one another. The built-in packing 1 is integrated in a multiple arrangement in a wet cooling tower in such a way that, as indicated by the arrow KW, the water to be cooled flows from the top and, as indicated by the arrows KL, cooling air flows in counter-current or cross-current through the arrangement.<br>
The built-in elements 2 forming a built-in packing 1 are constructed identically. As can be noted in this connection in particular from Figures 2 to 5, the corrugations form channels 3, which extend at an angle a of 30.째 to the vertical (Figure 2) in a straight line and parallel to one another. In the part of every channel 3 extends a continuous longitudinal strut 4 with a rectangular cross-secnon. The longer cross-sectional axis/ extends transversely to the channels B. The ends of the longitudinal struts rectangular contact plates 5, the longitudinal axes of which extend vertically. The contact plates 5 form integral parts of top and bottom closed edge strips 6. To this end two adjoining contact plates"" are joined together by connecting webs 7. These connecting webs 7 extend along the top and bottom transverse edges of the contact plates 5, so that the front faces of the contact plates 5 extend in the same horizontal planes as the front faces of the connecting webs 7 (Figures 2, 4 and 6).<br>
The longitudinal struts 4 are connected to one another by cross-webs 8 with a square cross-section. The cross-webs 8 extend in horizontal planes parallel to the two edge strips 6. In their longitudinal extent they have a shaped pattern with a longer centre leg 9 and two shorter end legs 10 (Figure 5). The end legs 10 lie in the vertical planes in which also the longitudinal struts 4<br>
By the intersection of the longitudinal struts 4 with the cross-webs 8 nodal points 11 are formed. Every nodal point 11 of a longitudinal strut 4 with a cross-web 8 is furthermore connected by diagonal webs 12 to the nodal points 11 of an adjoining longitudinal strut 4 with the cross-webs 8 extending in the adjoining horizontal planes. In this manner cross-shaped reinforcements are formed between two adjoining longitudinal struts 4 and two adjoining cross-webs 8. Also the diagonal webs 12 display a zig-zag shaped pattern in their longitudinal extent with in each instance a longer centre leg 13 and two shorter end legs 14 (Figure 5). The end legs 14 also lie in the vertical planes of the longitudinal struts 4. The diagonal webs 12 have a wedge-shaped cross-section.<br>
In particular Figures 4 and 5 still show that the connecting webs 7 between the contact plates 5 are connected to the cross-webs 8 positioned in the adjoining horizontal planes by ice-hockey stick like vertical webs 15.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show that in the middle height zone of a built-in element 2 the nodal points 11a of the longitudinal struts 4 with the cross-webs 8 and the diagonal webs 12 are enlarged to form support surfaces. According to the embodiment of Figures 1, 5 and 6, by way of these nodal points U a as well as the support surfaces of the contact plates 5, in each instance two adjoining built-in elements 2 are welded to one another. To this end one of the built-in elements 2 is arranged turned by 180째 around a vertical axis (Figures 1 and 5), so that at a contact between the contact plates 5 and the nodal points 11a the longitudinal struts 4 then cross one another.<br>
Instead of welding two adjoining built-in elements 2 together by way of the contact plates 5 and the nodal points 11a, according to the embodiment of Figure 7 it is also possible to mortise the two built-in elements together. To this<br>
end, on the contact plates 5 as well as on the nodal points 11a, in alternation tenons 16 and recesses 17 adapted to same are provided, so that the built-in elements 2 can simply be plugged together and in this way form a built-in packing 1.<br>
