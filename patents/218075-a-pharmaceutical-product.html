				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A pharmaceutical product comprising cyclopamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof in an amount sufficient to induce diferentiation of epidermal cells.<br>
Psoriasis is a common chronic disease affecting around 2% of the general population and any person from infancy to old age. Its etiology and pathogenesis are unclear. Family and twin studies have suggested a polygenic influence but the nature and the mechanisms of action of the involved genes are unknown (Elder JT at al. (2001) Arch.Dermatol.137:1447-1454). Environmental factors such as streptococcal infections and trauma to the skin are also associated with the formation of psoriatic lesions. How do these environmental factors contribute to psoriasis are again unclear. However the association with streptococcal infections, immunosuppressive actions of most of the current anti-psoriatic treatments and other findings are used widely to argue for an autoimmune nature of the disease and triggering by T lymphocytes (Gottlieb S.L. et al (1995) Nat. Med. 1:442-447; Nickoloff B.J. (1999) Arch. Dermatol. 135:1104-1110 ; Krueger J.G. (2002) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 46:1-23).<br>
Psoriasis vulgaris, characterized by well-demarcated scaly erythematous plaques of varying sizes anywhere on the skin, is the most common form of psoriasis. Histopathologic^ examinations of the psoriatic skin lesions reveal typical epidermal and dermal changes that include the following.<br>
Epidermal hyperplasia with elongation and thickening of rete ridges.<br>
Thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis.<br>
Focal losses or decrease of the thickness of the granular layer of epidermis.<br>
Infiltration of the subepidermal region of dermis with neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells.<br>
Dilatation and tortuosity of the capillaries in the papillary dermis, accompanied often by papillary edema.<br>
"Munro microabcesses", defined as focal intracomeal collections of neutrophils.<br>
Psoriatic skin lesions generally contain majority of the above listed histopathological changes and all changes can be found in a well-developed psoriatic lesion. In addition immunohistochemical and other indicators of the proliferating cells<br>
reveal presence of proliferating keratinocytes in the suprabasal layers of psoriatic lesional skin (proliferating cells are normally restricted to the basal layer of epidermis in healthy skin).<br>
Obscurity of the etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis has been reflected by the varied treatment strategies used for this disease (Spuls P.l. et al. (1997) Br. J. Dermatol. 137:943-949; Ashcroft D.M. et al. (2000) J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 25:1-10; Al-Suwaidan S.N. et al. (2000) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 42:796-802; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:487-498; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:649-661). Currently common treatments include the topical corticosteroids, systemic administration of immunosuppressants (usually cyclosporine), ultraviolet irradiation of the affected skin with or without psoralen, systemic retinoids and systemic methothrexate (Spuls P.l. et al. (1997) Br. J. Dermatol. 137:943-9,49; Ashcroft DM. et al. (2000) J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 25:1-10; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:487-498; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:649-661). At present there is no cure for psoriasis and patients face a need for life-long treatment. Therefore relatively simpler treatments (usually topical keratoses and corticosteroids) are considered first and when these fail, the more effective systemic treatments with more serious side effects are attempted. When the therapeutic aim is defined as the clearance of lesions, even the most effective systemic treatments are reported to fail in as many as one fourth of patients in large series (Spuls P.L et al. (1997) Br. J. Dermatol. 137:943-949) and, because of the serious side effects, patients and physicians are advised that at present "complete clearance is not a realistic expectation" (Al-Suwaidan S.N. et al. (2000) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 42:796-802). In practice side effects usually limit the more potent treatments to shorter-term management [ cyclosporine is nephrotoxic and strongly immunosuppressive, methotrexate is hepatotoxic,  ultraviolet irradtation-psoralen is mutagenic/carcinogenic (Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:649-661)]. However, in the long term, topical carticosteroids are also not devoid ofside effects (Lebwohl M. etal (2001) J. Am. Acad. DemiatoL 45:487-498). Currently available treatments require in general several weeks (typically 6-8 weeks) from the initiation of treatment to the appearance of objective clinical regression (Al-Suwaidan S.N. et al. (2000) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 42:796-802; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:649-661).<br>
Cycjopamine is a steroidal alkaloid that occurs naturally in the Veratrum plants. Teratogenicity of these plants on grazing pregnant animals led to the identification of cyclopamine as an active compound (Keeler R.F. (1969) Phytochemistry 8:223-225).<br>
How might have cyciopamine displayed teratogenicity was revealed by the finding that it is an inhibitor of the hedgehog/smoothened signal transduction pathway (Incardona J.P. et al. (1998) Development 125:3553-3562; Cooper M.K. et al. (1998) Science 280:1603-1607). The sonic hedgehog protein, a member of the hedgehog family of proteins, has been found to induce differentiation of its target cells, including the precursors of ventra) cells in the developming central nervous system (Goodrich L.V. et al. (1998) Neuron 21:; 1243-1257). Inhibition of the hedgehog/smoothened pathway by cyciopamine in the developing chicken brain prevented formation of the ventral cells and caused holoprosencephaly (Incardona J.P. et al. (1998) Development 125:3553-3562; Cooper M K  et al. (1998) Science 280:1603-1607), the common malformation observed in the lambs of the sheep grazing Veratrum (Binns W. et al. (1963) Am J. Vet. Res 24:1164-1175). Cyciopamine has been reported to inhibit cellular differentiation in other systems as well, including the differentiation of bone marrow cells to erythroid cells (Detmer K. et al. (2000) Dev. Biol. 222:242) and the differentiation of the urogenital sinus to prostate (BermanD.M. etal. (2000) J. Urol. 163:204).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to the use of cyclopamine, a naturally occurring steroidal alkaloid known for over thirty years, for the treatment of psoriasis and the achievement of rapid clearance of psoriatic lesions from the patient skin as fast as within a day with no detectable side effects. Disappearances of the clinical signs of psoriasis, including the erythema and scaling, from the skin of patients are accompanied by the reversions of the histopathological signs of psoriasis to normalcy and are achievable by topical treatment. Follow-up of the treated skin areas shows healthy-looking normal skin over months. These features make the use of cyclopamine highly desirable in the treatment of psoriasis and provide a solution to the long-standing problem of psoriasis treatment.<br>
For topical applications, cyclopamine can be dissolved in ethanol or another suitable solvent and mixed with a suitable base cream, ointment or gel. Cyclopamine may also be entrapped in hydrogels or in other pharmaceutical forms enabling controlled release and may be adsorbed onto dermal patches. The effects shown in figures Fig.1 A to Fig.lF (clinical pictures) and Fig.2A to Fig.2W and Fig.3A to Fig.3L (histopathological and immunohistochemical findings) have been obtained by a cream preparation obtained by mixing a solution of cyclopamine in ethanol with a base cream so as to get a final concentration of 18 mM cyclopamine in cream. The base cream used is made predominantly of heavy paraffin oil (10 % w/w), vaseline (10 % w/w), stearyl alcohol (8 % w/w), polyoxylsteareth-40 (3 % wAv) and water (68 % wAv) but another suitably formulated base cream is also possible. Optimal concentration of cyclopamine in a pharmaceutical form as well as the optimal dosing and application schedules can obviously be affected by such factors as the particular pharmaceutical form and the localization and characteristics of the skin lesion; howeverthese can be determined by following well known published optimization methods. The dosing and the application schedules followed for the lesion shown in Fig.lA (psoriatic plaque on the dorsum of hand ) are as follows: ~30 yi cream applied directly onto the lesion with the aid of a steel spatula every four hours for 24 hours. The cream -applied area is protected from accidental smearing and loss of the cream by covering with an aluminum applicator (Fig.lB). The dosing and the application schedules followed for the lesion shown in Fig.lD (psoriatic plaque at the scapular region) are as follows: -30 \i\ cream applied directly onto the lesion every four hours for 24 hours. The cream-applied area is similarly covered against the smearing and loss of cream. Other treated psoriatic patients and lesions received from ~30 to 35 \d cream to each lesion at intervals of<br>
every 3 to 5 hours, as suitable and convenient. Lesions were similarly covered against the smearing and loss of cream. Placebo cream (the base cream mixed with ethanol with no added cyclopamine) applications onto comparably sized psoriatic plaques as the cyclopamine-treated psoriatic plaques followed the same dosing, schedule and covering of the lesions; placebo-treated psoriatic plaques showed no detectable effect or regression (data not shown). Preservation of the undifferentiated cells in the normal epidermis and in hair follicles following exposure to cyclopamine, as described in an earlier patent application by us (Tas S. et al. (2001) PCT/TR 01/00027 ) as well as in this invention, provide information about the tolerable doses in other possible modes of administration of cyclopamine; e.g. intralesional injections or covering with suitable dermal patches and timed-release formulations.<br>
Fig.lA and Hg.1C show a psoriatic plaque before and after exposure to cyclopamine and the rapid dinical regression. The cydopamine cream was applied to the proximal half of this lesion present on the dorsum of right hand of a 57 years old patient having plaque-type psoriasis. At intervals of 4 hours, ~30 u.l cream was applied directly onto the lesion and the cream-applied region was covered against accidental smearing and loss df the cream ( Fig.1 B). Already on the 4 th hour of treatment, the cream-applied half of the psoriatic plaque displayed slight decrease in erythema. The erythema was no longer visible in the cydopamine-appiied half of the lesion at the 12 th hour and on the 24 th hour, when the erythema and scaling had visibly disappeared from the cyclopamine-treated half (Fig.lC), the skin area corresponding to the entire former lesion (both the treated and non-treated halves) was exdsed together with a ~5 mm margin of surrounding non-involved skin.<br>
Figures Fig.2A to Fig.2Wshow histopathologicai and immunohistochemical examination findings of the tissue sedions from the non-lesional skin, cydopamine-treated lesional skin and non-treated lesional skin. Compared to the non-lesional skin (Fig.2A), the non-treated lesional skin (Fig.2B) is seen to display the typical histopathologicai signs of a psoriatic skin lesion mentioned above in the "Background of Invention". Tissue sections from the cydopamine-treated half of the original lesion reveal, however, dramatic improvement and regression to normalcy. These histopathologicai signs of regression to normalcy, exemplified in the figures Fig.2C and Fig.2D (examples from other cydopamine-treated lesions and patients are given later) indude the following:<br>
Return of the thickened and elongated rete ridges to normal levels and marked decrease of epidermal hyperplasia (Fig.2C versus Fig.2B ).<br>
Return of the thinning of the suprapapillary epidermis to normalcy and the disappearance of papillary edema (Fig.2C versus Fig.2B).<br>
Vigorous re-appearance of the granular layer of epidermis in the cyclopamine-treated epidermis (Fig.2C and Fig.2D) contrasted with the focaily decreased or lost granular layer in the non-treated lesional epidermis (Fig.2B).<br>
Disappearance from the cyclopamine-treated lesional skin of most of the inflammatory cells that infiltrated the subepidermal dermis of the non-treated lesional skin (Fig.2C versus Fig.2B).<br>
The hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis seen in the stratum corneum of the non-treated lesional skin (Fig.2B) decreased but full normalization of this oldest epidermal layer did not yet happen at the 24 th hour of cyclopamine treatment (Fig.2C, Fig.2D).<br>
Tissue sections from the junctional area of the cyclopamine-treated and non-treated lesional skin revealed that regions of the lesional skin that received relatively lesser concentrations of cyclopamine (by diffusion from the nearby treated area) still displayed signs of regression towards normalcy but relatively less pronouncedly (Fig.2E, Fig.2F).<br>
Relevant immunohistochemical findings with the tissues described above are summarized below and exemplified through figures Fig.2G to Fig.2W. All antibodies and reagents for these immunohistochemical investigations were purchased from DAKO (Glostrup.Denmark); human Ki-67 antigen was detected by the monoclonal antibody M7187, human epithelial antigen was detected by the monoclonal antibody Ber-EP4, human CD4 antigen was detected by the monoclonal antibody M0716, human CD8 antigen was detected by the monoclonal antibody C8/144B. Besides the CD8 antigen, the monoclonal antibody C8/144B is known to recognize and bind to the cytokeratin 15 expressed by the hair stem cells (Kanitakis J. et al. (1999) Eur.J.Dermatol. 9:363-365). A DAKO" universal visualization kit" (LSAB2) employing biotinylated secondary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (pre-diluted to match the dilutions of DAKO-supplied primary antibodies) was used for the visualization reactions. All reaction conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer.<br>
The Ki-67 antigen is a marker of the proliferating cells. As shown in Fig.2G, the Ki-67 displaying cells were restricted mostly to the basal layer in the epidermis of non-lesional skin. Sections of the non-treated lesional skin showed, on the other hand, increased numbers of Ki-67 positive cells in the epidermis and numerous Ki-67 positive cells in the suprabasal layers of epidermis (Fig.2H), as is well known for psoriasis. Fig.2l<br>
shows return of both the frequency and the epidermal position of the Ki-67 antigen positive cells to normalcy in cyclopamine-treated lesional skin. Tissue sections of the junctional areas of the cyclopamine-treated lesional skin with the non-treated lesional skin (Fig.2J) and with the non-tesional skin ( Fig.2K) show again the normalizing effect of cyclopamine on the frequency and epidermal position of Ki-67 positive cells and provide evidence of a concentration-dependent effect of cyclopamine.<br>
The monoclonal antibody Ber-EP4 is known to label the basal layer cells in normal epidermis. The outer root sheath of hair follicles, where the hair stem cells are thought to reside, are also known to be labeled with Ber-EP4. Fig.2L shows that non-Iesional skin showed a normal pattern of labeling with Ber-EP4 (i.e. labeling of the basal layer cells). The non-treated psoriatic lesional epidermis, on the other hand, showed absence of labeling of the basal layer with Ber-EP4 under the same conditions (Fig.2M). This Ber-EP4 detected abnormality of the basal layer cells in the psoriatic lesional epidermis, as far as we know previously undescribed, reverted to normalcy upon treatment of the lesion with cyclopamine (Fig.2N).<br>
Fig.20 shows a Ber-EP4 stained tissue section from the cyclopamine-treated and non-treated junctional area of the psoriatic lesion. The normalising action of cyclopamine on the psoriatic lesion at a distance suggests sensitivity of the Ber-EP4 detected abnormality to cyclopamine. Exposure of the basal cell carcinoma cells to cyclopamine was found earlier to cause their differentiation and caused loss of their Ber-EP4 staining (Tas S. et al, (2001) PCT/TR 01/00027). Basal cells of the normal epidermis exposed to cyclopamine under the same conditions, however, continued to be Ber-EP4 positive (Tas S. et ai. (2001) PCT/TR 01/00027). Fig.2P shows that basal cells of the non-Iesional skin in psoriasis also remained Ber-EP4 positive after exposure to cyclopamine,- the basal cell characteristics were maintained.<br>
Cytokeratin 15, recognized by the C8/114B antibody, is found normally both in the hair follicle and in the basal layer cells in normal epidermis (Kanitakis J. et al (1999) Eur. J. Dermatol.9:363-365). Fig. 2R shows the labeling of the basal layer cells by C8/144B in non-Iesional skin. In contrast, basal layer cells of the non-treated psoriatic lesional skin were stained very weakly or not at all with the C8/144B antibody (Fig.2S). On the other hand, epidermal basal layer cells in the cyclopamine-treated half of the lesional skin were normalized and became labeled by the C8/144B antibody (Fig.2T). As both C8/144B and Ber-EP4 detect both the outer root sheath cells and the normal epidermal basal layer<br>
cells, the basal cell abnonmaiity revealed by these two antibodies in the psoriatic Iesional epidermis may be related or identical. Cyclopamine did not adversely affect the non-lesional skin and, similar to the situation with Ber-EP4, basal cells of the non-lesional epidermis that were exposed to cyclopamine continued to be positive for the cytokeratin 15 (Fig.2U).<br>
Infiltration of dermis with CD4 positive lymphocytes, a well-known feature of psoriatic plagues, was displayed by the non-treated psoriatic Iesional skin (Fig.2V). On the other hand, the CD4 positivejlymphocyles Infiltrating the psoriatic Iesional skin were largely cleared from the cyclopamine-treated half of the Iesional skin (Fig.2W).<br>
Genetic heterogeneity and different ages of the psoriatic patients as well as the localisations heterogeneity of psoriatic lesions throughout body invite evaluation of the use of cyclopamine on different patients and lesions. In this invention, treatments of unrelated patients ranging from 29 years of age to 57 years and treatments of psoriatic lesions localised on various body parts ranging from extremities to the trunk showed that cyclopamine was highly effective on every psoriatic lesion for which it was used and resulted in regression and clearance (7 separate lesions on different patients were treated at the time of writing of this invention). Figures Fig.1D, Fig.lE and Fig.lF show that even when cyclopamine was applied for a day and then discontinued, the psoriatic plaque that received the treatment continued to regress and cleared totally. In this particular case the psoriatic plaque displayed decreased erythema on the 12th hour of treatment. Despite marked regression, it was still visible on the fourth day of follow-up. The lesion cleared after day 8 and the site of the treated lesion is displaying healthy-looking normal skin over a month of follow-up at the time of writing of this invention. Cyclopamine, applied topically on healthy skin as disclosed in this invention and earlier (las S. et al.(2001) PCT/TR 01/00027) had no detectable adverse effect. The longest duration of foNow-up for a possible adverse effect of topical cyclopamine on healthy skin is over 14 months at the time of writing of this invention and no adverse effect has been found.<br>
Figures Fig.3C to Fig.3L show skin tissue sections from the non-lesional skin, non-treated psoriatic Iesional skin and the cyclopamine-treated Iesional skin of different patients (patients other than the one described in figures Fig.2A to Fig.2W) and further exemplify the uses and findings of this invention.<br>
Figures Fig.3A, Fig.3B and Fig.3C show histopathological findings with non-lesional skin tissue, non-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue and cyclopamine-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue at the 24th hour of treatment and exemplify the cyclopamine-induced regression of the psoriatic plaque on a patient.<br>
Figures Fig.3D, Fig.3E and Fig.3F show immunohistochemical staining for the Ki-67 antigen of non-iesional skin tissue, non-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue and cyclopamine-treated lesional skin tissue at the 24th hour of treatment and exemplify the cyclopamine-induced regression of another psoriatic plaque.<br>
Figures Fig.3G, Fig.3H and Fig.3l show immunohistochemical staining using the Ber-EP4 antibody of the non-lesipnal skin tissue, non-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue and cyclopamine-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue at the 24th hour of treatment and exemplify on another patient the Ber-EP4 detected abnormality of the basal layer cells in the psoriatic lesional skin as well as the cyclopamine-induced reversion to normalcy.<br>
Figures Fig.3J, Fig.3K and Fig.3L show immunohistochemical staining with the C8/144B antibody of the non-lesipnal skin tissue, non-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue and cyclopamine-treated psoriatic lesional skin tissue at the 24th hour of treatment and exemplify on a different patient the C8/144B detected abnormality of the basal layer cells in the psoriatic lesional skin as well as the cyclopamine-induced reversion to normalcy.<br>
Studies published prior to this invention reported a blocking of the cellular differentiation by cyclopamine and suggested that cyciopamine may be used for preventing differentiation (Detmer K. et al. (2000) Dev. Biol. 222:242; Berman D.M. et al. (2000) J. Urol. 163:240). However, we have found that the exposure of psoriatic lesional skin to cyclopamine induced rather differentiation of the epidermal cells. Re-appearance of the granular layer in the epidermis of the cyclopamine-treated psoriatic lesional skin shows that the block to differentiation in the psoriatic plaque was overcome by the cyclopamine treatment. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the finding of this invention on the Ki-67 antigen expression by the epidermal cells in the cyclopamine-treated psoriatic lesional skin may also be related to an induction of differentiation by cyclopamine. Disappearance of proliferating cells from the suprabasal layers of the psoriatic lesional epidermis following exposure to cyclopamine (Fig.2H versus Fig.2l and Fig.3E versus Fig.3F) may be consequential to a regain of the potential for terminal differentiation. Regardless of the precise mechanism, return of the<br>
overproliferative activity of the psoriatic lesional epidermis to normal levels following exposure to cyclopamine is by itself beneficial (has therapeutic value).<br>
Rapid clearance of the psoriatic plaques as described in this invention (as fast as within a day) can be contrasted with the average of 6 to 8 weeks of treatment required for the conventional treatments to become effective (Al-Suwaidan S.N. et al. (2000) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 42:796-802; Lebwohl M. et al. (2001) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 45:649-661). Thus the treatment described in this invention represents a major improvement and solution to a long-standing problem. The rapidity of the response to cyclopamine suggests in addition intervention with a primary or proximal causative event involved in the formation of the psoriatic plaque.<br>
As there is evidence for the involvement of the hedgehog/smoothened signal transduction pathway in the maintenance of epidermal stem cells, untoward side effects of cyclopamine on skin are, a priori, possible and must be excluded. As described in this invention and earlier (Tas 8. et al. (2001) PCT/TR 01/00027), under the described concentration and dosing conditions no adverse effect has been detected. Lack of detectable side effects of the described treatment, combined with hitherto unachieved high topical effectivity represents a solution to the therapeutic dilemma that aggressive uses of conventional treatments often result in unacceptable adverse effects but their less aggressive uses may leave the patient with his/her lesions of psoriasis (Al-Suwaidan S.N. et al (2000) J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 42:796-802)..<br><br><br><br><br><br>
