				<td>The present invention is directed to non-evaporable getter alloys for the<br>
sorption of hydrogen. In particular the invention deals with non-evaporable getter<br>
alloys having good properties of hydrogen sorption at relatively low temperatures.<br>
Many applications in the field of industry or research require for their<br>
correct working a hydrogen-free environment in a closed container; the space<br>
inside the container may be either kept under high vacuum conditions or filled<br>
with an atmosphere of a given gas (or gas mixtures). Examples of industrial<br>
applications in which hydrogen is detrimental are the evacuated jackets for<br>
thermal insulation (e.g. in thermal bottles, also known as "thermos", or solar<br>
collectors), owing to the high thermal conductivity of this gas; some types of<br>
lamps, in which the presence of hydrogen in the filling gas generally results in the<br>
variation of the operating physical parameters (such as the lighting voltage); or the<br>
X-rays generating tubes. The processes for manufacturing these devices comprise<br>
a step of container evacuation and possible filling thereof with the desired gas, but<br>
whenever a high vacuum or a hydrogen-free gas are produced, mechanisms exist<br>
which cause hydrogen to re-enter the system; these mechanisms are mainly the<br>
degassing of the container walls and the hydrogen permeation across these walls<br>
from the external atmosphere toward the container, thus leading to problems in<br>
the correct operation of said devices. Owing to the same mechanisms, hydrogen<br>
also represents the main contribution to the residual pressure in the ultra-high<br>
vacuum (UHV) systems, such as the particles accelerators employed in the<br>
research field.<br>
To remove these hydrogen traces it is known to employ non-evaporable<br>
getter materials (known in the field as NEGs), i.e. materials being capable of<br>
chemically fixing molecules of hydrogen as well as of other gases such as water,<br>
oxygen and carbon oxides. The getter materials are generally metals of the III, IV<br>
and V transition groups or alloys thereof with other elements, generally transition<br>
metals or aluminum. The most used getter materials are titanium- and,<br>
particularly, zirconium-based alloys. These materials and their use for sorbing<br>
gases from evacuated spaces or from inert gases are well known and described in<br>
2<br>
«<br>
a number of patents, such as US 3,203,901 (that discloses zirconium-aluminum<br>
alloys), US 4,071,335 (zirconium-nickel alloys), US 4,306,887 (zirconium-iron<br>
alloys), US 4,312,669 (zirconium-vanadium-iron alloys), US 4,668,424<br>
(zirconium-nickel-Rare Earths alloys with the optional addition of one or more<br>
other metals), US 4,839,085 (zirconium-vanadium-E alloys, wherein E is an<br>
element selected among Fe, Ni, Mn and Al), and US 5,961,750 (zirconium-cobalt-<br>
Rare Earths alloys).<br>
In particular, as far as hydrogen sorption is concerned, the use of yttrium or<br>
solid mixtures containing the same is also known. US patent 3,953,755 discloses<br>
the use of this element (protected by thin layers of other metals) at the inside of<br>
discharge lamps. Patent GB 1,248,184 discloses the use of solid mixtures or<br>
intermetallic compoimds of yttrium with other metals for sorbing hydrogen in<br>
various applications. This patent requires that yttrium is anyhow present in form<br>
of a separate phase in a sufficient quantity to accomplish the gettering function, so<br>
that the getter properties of the compositions according to that patent are ,<br>
essentially the same as those of pure yttrium. This characteristic can also be<br>
ascribed to the fact that with many of the metals listed in the patent (zirconium,<br>
titanium, niobium, hafnium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten and vanadium)<br>
yttrium does not form compounds nor alloys, whereas with other metals<br>
(aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, nickel, manganese and<br>
zinc) yttrium only forms intermetallic compounds but not alloys (see the book<br>
"Constitution of Binary Alloys", First Supplement, edited by R.P. Elliot,<br>
McGraw-Hill, 1965) and the yttrium quantities there indicated are however such<br>
that in the composition this element is ensured to be in excess with respect to the<br>
quantity that could be bound in form of intermetallic compounds, whereby at least<br>
a portion thereof remains in form of pure metal. Finally, patent application WO<br>
03/029502 discloses yttrium-vanadium and yttrium-tin compositions being rich in<br>
yttrium; also in this case the hydrogen sorption properties of the material are<br>
essentially those of pure yttrium. The fiinction of the metals added to yttrium in<br>
these two last documents is mainly that of enhancing the hydrogen sorption by the<br>
getter.<br>
3<br>
9<br>
NEG materials show a sorption behavior with respect to hydrogen different<br>
from that towards other gases. While for most gases the chemical sorption by<br>
these alloys is irreversible, the sorption of hydrogen by NEGs is an equilibrium<br>
process reversible as a fiinction of the temperature: hydrogen is efficiently sorbed<br>
at relatively low temperatures (under 200-400 °C, according to the chemical<br>
composition of the material), but it is released at higher temperatures. The<br>
equilibrium features of these materials in sorbing hydrogen are generally<br>
represented graphically by means of curves giving, at different temperatures, the<br>
equilibrium pressure of hydrogen over the alloy as a function of the hydrogen<br>
concentration in the NEG material.<br>
Another feature of the NEGs is that, in order to accomplish their function,<br>
they generally require a treatment of initial thermal activation at temperatures that<br>
can vary between about 300 °C up to about 900 °C during a time comprised<br>
between few minutes up to several hours depending on the material composition.<br>
Advantageous features for a NEG material to be employed for hydrogen<br>
sorption are a low hydrogen equilibrium pressure and a low activation<br>
temperature.<br>
Among the previously cited NEG materials those with the best features of<br>
hydrogen sorption (low equilibrium pressures) are the zirconium-aluminum<br>
alloys, the zirconium-cobalt-Rare Earths alloys and yttrium. Among these<br>
materials the zirconium-aluminum alloys have a high activation temperature: in<br>
order to carry out a good activation of these alloys in a not excessively long time<br>
it is necessary to activate them at temperatures higher than 700 °C; this feature<br>
makes them not suitable for any application, such as when the chamber to be kept<br>
free from hydrogen has glass walls, e.g. thermos or some lamps. Yttrium and<br>
compositions of patent GB 1,248,184 (which, as seen before, are functionally the<br>
same as pure yttrium) only work well if kept at relatively high temperatures, of<br>
more than about 600 °C. The zirconium-cobalt-Rare Earths alloys require lower<br>
temperatures of activation and operation, but have worse properties of hydrogen<br>
sorption (particularly the equilibrium pressure) than those of yttrium.<br>
Object of the present invention is to provide non-evaporable getter alloys for<br>
4 •<br>
9<br>
hydrogen sorption. In particular, object of the present invention is that of<br>
providing getter alloys showing a combination of features of hydrogen<br>
equilibrium pressure and of activation temperature which is improved with respect<br>
to known NEG materials.<br>
According to the present invention this object is achieved with nonevaporable<br>
getter alloys comprising, by weight, from 50% to 80% zirconium,<br>
from 1% to 20% yttrium and from 5% to 45% of one or more elements chosen<br>
among aluminum, iron, chromium, memgEinese and vanadium.<br>
The invention will be described in the following with reference to the<br>
drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a ternary diagram in which the range of possible<br>
compositions of the NEG alloys according to the invention is<br>
represented;<br>
Figures 2a-2d show some possible embodiments of non-evaporable<br>
getter devices made by using the alloys of the invention;<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show X-rays spectra of two preferred alloys of the<br>
invention;<br>
Figures 5, 6 and 7 represent graphs showing the hydrogen sorption<br>
features of some alloys of the invention and of some comparison alloys.<br>
The alloys usefiil for carrying out the invention are those that, when plotted<br>
on the ternary diagram of weight percentage compositions of Figure 1, fall within<br>
the polygon defined by points:<br>
a) Zr 54% - Y 1 % - M 45%<br>
b) Zr 50% - Y 5% - M 45%<br>
c) Zr 50% - Y 20% - M 30%<br>
d) Zr 75% - Y 20% - M 5%<br>
e) Zr80%-Y15%-M5%<br>
f) Zr80%-Yl%-M19%<br>
wherein with M is meant an element selected among aluminum, iron,<br>
chromium, manganese, vanadium or mixtures of these elements.<br>
One first preferred alloy of the invention is that of weight percent<br>
5<br>
composition Zr 69% - Y 10% - Fe 21%, represented by point g in figure 1; a<br>
second preferred alloy of the invention is that having weight percent composition<br>
Zr 61% - Y 20% - Fe 19%, represented by point h in figure 1.<br>
The alloys of the invention can be prepared by melting in ftimace, from<br>
pieces or powders of the component metals, taken in the mutual ratios<br>
corresponding to the desired final composition. Preferred are the techniques of arc<br>
melting under inert gas, e.g. with a pressure of 3 x lO'* Pascal (Pa) of argon; or in<br>
an induction furnace, under vacuum or inert gas. It is however possible to adopt<br>
other techniques which are common in the metallurgical field for preparing alloys.<br>
Melting requires temperatures higher than about 1000 °C.<br>
Differently from compositions of patent GB 1,248,184 and application WO<br>
03/029502 previously described, wherein yttrium is present as a separate phase,<br>
mixed only mechanically with the other components, the materials of the<br>
invention are actually true alloys as shown by the X-rays diffraction spectra of<br>
figures 3 and 4, discussed in the following with reference to the examples.<br>
For the production of getter devices using the alloys of the invention, be<br>
these in form of pellets of the getter material alone or made with the latter either<br>
on a support or in a container, it is preferred to use the alloys in powder form,<br>
with particle size generally lower than 250 micrometers (^m) and preferably<br>
comprised between 40 and 125 |^m. Greater particle sizes result in an excessive<br>
reduction of the specific surface (surface area per weight unit) of the material,<br>
with consequent reduction of the gas sorption properties in particular at<br>
temperatures of less than about 200 °C; although their use is possible and required<br>
in some applications, particle sizes of less than 40 |J,m give rise to problems in the<br>
manufacturing steps of the getter devices.<br>
The shapes in which the getter devices can be prepared by using the alloys<br>
of the invention are the most various, comprising pellets formed of the getter<br>
alloys powders either alone or on a metallic support. In both cases the powders<br>
can be compacted either by compression or sintering. The pellets of compressed<br>
powders only may be applied for example in the thermal insulation of thermos.<br>
When the powders are supported, steel, nickel or nickel-based alloys are generally<br>
6<br>
used as supporting material. The support can merely be in form of a strip on the<br>
surface of which the alloy powders are caused to adhere by either cold rolling or<br>
sintering after deposition by means of various techniques; getter devices obtained<br>
from such strips are used in lamps. The support can also be formed as an actual<br>
container, having the most various shapes, in which the powders are generally<br>
introduced by compression or even without compression in some devices having<br>
the container provided with a porous septum, permeable to the gas flow but<br>
capable of retaining powders. Some of these possibilities are illustrated in the<br>
figures 2a-2d: figure 2a shows a pellet 20 made of compressed powders only of<br>
NEG alloy; Figure 2b shows a NEG device 30 formed of a metallic strip 31 on<br>
which powders 32 of NEG alloy are present; figure 2c shows in cross-section a<br>
NEG device 40 formed of a metallic container 41 with an upper opening 42<br>
having at the inside thereof powders of NEG alloy 43; and figure 2d shows in<br>
cross-section a NEG device 50 consisting in a metallic container 51 having inside<br>
powders of NEG alloy 52 with an upper opening closed by a porous septum 53.<br>
The NEG alloys of the invention can be activated by means of treatments of<br>
either few minutes at 500 °C or at about 300 °C during one or two hours, which<br>
are softer conditions than those typically required by the zirconium-aluminum<br>
alloys (temperatures of about 800-900 °C); fixrthermore they show good<br>
properties of hydrogen sorption at temperatures lower than those required by<br>
using yttrium or compositions of the prior art containing this element.<br>
The invention will be fiirther illustrated by the following examples. These<br>
non-limiting examples describe some embodiments intended to teach those skilled<br>
in the art how to put into practice the invention and to represent the best<br>
considered mode for carrying out the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example describes the preparation of several alloys of the invention.<br>
A series of alloys is produced starting from the component elements in<br>
powder form, weighing the powders in the desired ratio as given in the following<br>
table, that reports the weights in grams for each element and the nature of element<br>
M for the different samples:<br>

The powders are mixed and poured into a water cooled copper crucible of<br>
an arc furnace under an atmosphere of 3 x 10'* Pa of argon (so-called "cold-earth"<br>
technique). The temperature reached by the mixture during melting is of about<br>
2000 °C, temperature that is maintained during about 5 minutes. Since the<br>
preparations take place under conditions of a high thermal gradient, in order to<br>
enhance the alloy homogeneity any ingot melting is repeated four times. The<br>
ingots obtained by cooling after the fourth melting are milled and the resulting<br>
powder is finally sieved, retrieving the fi-action with particle size comprised<br>
between 40 and 105 |j.m.<br>
The compositions of samples no. 1 and no. 2 correspond to points g and h,<br>
respectively, in the ternary diagram of figure 1. A portion of powders of these two<br>
samples are used to obtain the X-rays diffractometry spectra illustrated in figures<br>
3 and 4 for samples 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
The remainder of powders of samples 1 and 2, and the powders of the other<br>
samples, are used to prepare several pellets for each sample, which are used in the<br>
subsequent tests: the pellets are obtained compressing 120 mg of powders of each<br>
sample under a pressure of 2000 kg/cm .<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
This example is directed to the preparation of a sample of an alloy made of<br>
8<br>
41<br>
zirconium, cobalt and misch-metal (misch-metal is a commercial mixture of<br>
lanthanum and Rare Earths); the features and preparation of this alloy are<br>
described in US patent 5,961,750.<br>
80.8 g of zirconium, 14.2 g of cobalt and 5.0 g of mischmetal having an<br>
approximate weight percent composition 50% cerium, 30% lanthanxmi, 15%<br>
neodymium and the remainder 5% of other Rare Earths are weighed. The<br>
procedure of example 1 is repeated preparing also in this case a set of identical<br>
pellets. This sample will be referred to as sample 10 in the following.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
This example is directed to the preparation of a mixture having the same<br>
overall weight percent composition of sample 1 of example 1, but formed of<br>
powders of an alloy of zirconium and iron only with yttrium powders.<br>
The zirconium-iron alloy is obtained like in example 1, starting from 69 g of<br>
zirconium and 21 g of iron, both in powder, melting the powders, allowing them<br>
to solidify, milling the ingot thus obtained and retrieving the fraction of particle<br>
size comprised between 40 and 105 )am by sieving. Then, 10 g of powdered<br>
yttrium having the same particle size are added to the powders thus obtained; with<br>
this mixture of powders a set of identical pellets are prepared as described in<br>
example 1. This sample will be referred to as sample 11 in the following.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A hydrogen sorption test is carried out on a pellet of each of samples 1,2,<br>
10 and 11. All the pellets are activated at 500 °C for 10 minutes. The sorption<br>
tests are carried out according to the procedure described in the ASTM F 798-82<br>
standard with a test temperature of 400 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 4 x 10"^ Pa:<br>
these tests are said to take place under "dynamic conditions" because the test<br>
chamber is fed with a variable flow of hydrogen, regulated by means of a feedback<br>
system, in order to have a constant pressure of hydrogen over the pellet<br>
imder test. The results of these tests are graphically represented in Figure 5 as<br>
sorption speed, S, measured in cubic centimeters of sorbed hydrogen per second<br>
and per gram of alloy (cc/s x g), as a function of the quantity of sorbed hydrogen,<br>
Q, measured in cubic centimeters of gas multiplied by the sorption pressure (in<br>
9<br>
4<br>
Pascal) and normalized per gram of alloy (cc x Pa/g); the numbering of curves<br>
corresponds to the numbering of samples (thick lines are used for the samples of<br>
the invention, thin lines for comparative samples 10 and 11).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The hydrogen equilibrium pressure of another pellet of sample 1 prepared as<br>
described in example 1, is measured.<br>
The measurement system is formed as a glass bulb, connected to a pumping<br>
apparatus through a liquid nitrogen trap which helps to keep a low background<br>
pressure during the test; the sample is heated from the outside of the bulb by<br>
radio-frequencies by means of an induction coil. The system is evacuated until a<br>
residual pressure of 1 x 10"^ Pa is reached. Under pumping the sample is activated<br>
by heating with radio-frequency at 700 °C for an hour. At the end of activation<br>
process the sample is brought to the temperature of 600 °C and the bulb is isolated<br>
from the pumping apparatus. A measured quantity of hydrogen is introduced into<br>
the bulb and the pressure variations are measured by means of a capacitance<br>
manometer; the pressure value at which the system stabilizes provides the<br>
equilibriimi pressure under those conditions. Such a procedure is repeated several<br>
times while each time a different quantity of hydrogen is introduced into the<br>
system. From the measurement of the equilibrium pressures, being knovm the<br>
system volume and the alloy weight, the concentration of hydrogen sorbed by the<br>
alloy under the different measurement conditions is obtained. The values of<br>
equilibrium pressure, P, measured in hectopascal (hPa), are graphically<br>
represented in figure 6 (curve 1) as a fimction of the sorbed hydrogen<br>
concentration, C, measured in cubic centimeters of gas multiplied by the sorption<br>
pressure and normalized per gram of alloy (cc x hPa/g).<br>
For comparison, in the graph of figure 6 are also shown two curves relating<br>
to the hydrogen equilibrium pressure of two materials considered in the field<br>
particularly suitable for the sorption of hydrogen, namely, a zirconium-cobaltmischmetal<br>
alloy of composition corresponding to that of sample 10 (curve 10)<br>
and a zirconium-aluminum alloy of US patent 3,203,901 (curve labeled Zr-Al);<br>
curves 10 and Zr-Al are portions of lines obtained by averaging the data resulting<br>
10<br>
4<br>
from a number of experimental tests carried out in the past with said known alloys<br>
in the same conditions as described above for sample 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A series of hydrogen sorption tests is carried out on all samples 1 and 3<br>
through 11. This series of tests is carried out under so called "static conditions",<br>
because hydrogen is fed into the measuring chamber in subsequent dosings,<br>
insulating the chamber between two successive dosings, rather than continuously;<br>
the measuring system and procedure are described in detail in the paper "The<br>
properties of some zirconium-based gettering alloys for hydrogen isotope storage<br>
and purification", C. Boffito et al., published in Journal of Less-Common Metals<br>
(1984), vol. 104, page 149.<br>
The tests are performed in the following conditions:<br>
initial hydrogen pressure at each dosing =1x10"' hPa;<br>
getter temperature = 400 °C;<br>
no getter activation<br>
The output of these tests are the curves shown in figure 7, giving for each<br>
sample the speed of hydrogen pumping, S (expressed in cc/s), as a fimction of the<br>
quantity of hydrogen sorbed, Q (expressed in ccx hPa); the numbering of curves<br>
corresponds to the numbering of samples.<br>
The results of experimental tests described above are discussed below.<br>
The diffractrograms shown in figures 3 and 4 refer to Zr-Y-Fe alloys<br>
containing 10% and 20% by weight of yttrium, respectively; the diffractograms<br>
show the intensity of the peaks (I, in arbitrary units, a.u.) as a function of<br>
reflection angle (2 0); the vertical lines shown in the spectra, at 2 9 angles of<br>
about 28.3°, 31.2°, 32.3° and 42.6°, respectively, represent the positions and<br>
relative intensities of the peaks of pure yttrium. The main peaks in both<br>
diffractograms are not coincident with those of yttrium; furthermore, in case of the<br>
alloy containing 10% by weight of yttrium, essentially there are no peaks in the<br>
positions corresponding to those of pure yttrium, thus confirming that in this case<br>
yttrium is present completely alloyed with zirconium and iron, whereas in the case<br>
of composition with 20% of yttrium, "shoulders" that can be attributed to yttrium<br>
11<br>
#<br>
are observed in connection to main peaks.<br>
The graph of figure 5 confirms that the alloys of the invention have<br>
hydrogen sorption properties at least equal to those of a zirconium-cobaltmischmetal<br>
alloy of the prior art, which is considered particularly suitable for<br>
sorbing this gas; fiirthermore the alloys of the' invention are clearly superior in<br>
sorbing hydrogen with respect to the mixture between a Zr-Fe alloy and pure<br>
yttrium of the example 3 (curve 11), and this too confirms that yttrium forms an<br>
actual, true alloy in the compositions of the invention (particularly meaningful is<br>
the comparison of hydrogen sorption properties of samples 1 and 11, being the<br>
compositions of these two samples nominally identical).<br>
The graph of figure 7 give similar results: all the compositions of the<br>
invention (curves 1 and 3 through 9) show properties of hydrogen sorption that<br>
are better than those of an alloy of example 2 (curve 10), widely used in the field<br>
for hydrogen sorption, as well as of the mixture of example 3 (curve 11).<br>
Finally, curve 1 in figure 6 shows the^ variation trend of the hydrogen<br>
equilibrium pressure of a pellet of sample 1, compared to similar graphs for<br>
knovra alloys widely used in the field for hydrogen sorption. Again, this graph<br>
shows that an alloy of the invention, at the same activation temperature (700 °C)<br>
and test temperature (600 °C) shows a hydrogen equilibrium pressvire which is<br>
neatly lower, by about one order of magnitude, with respect to the comparison<br>
alloys.<br>
The alloys of the invention have hydrogen equilibrium pressure values, as<br>
well as activation and operation temperatures, lower than those of known alloys;<br>
at the same time, the alloys of the invention have lower activation and operation<br>
temperatures than yttriimi; this could be due to the fact that, differently from the<br>
prior art materials, in this case yttrium forms actually true alloys with the other<br>
elements being present.<br>
