Novel Boronate esters<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to optically active dihydroxy<br>
hexanoate derivatives of formula IIa and more particularly to compounds of formula II which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of HMG-CoA enzyme inhibitors like atorvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
where R1 and R2 are independently chosen alkyl of one to three carbons and R3 is alkyl of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, alternatively<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently chosen from alkyl of one to three carbons, phenyl or R1 and R2 taken together as -(CH2)n- wherein n is 4 or 5 and R3 is alkyl of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms and also    compounds of Formula lb<br><br><br>
defined above is a valuable structural element for synthesizing compounds, which are known as anti-hypercholesterolemic agents having an inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase.<br>
EP 0 319 847 describes a process for the preparation of compounds of formula 1 starting from L-Malic acid. This process, however, suffers from the fact that the process is not industrially scalable and also possesses purification problems due to the nonÂ¬crystalline nature of the intermediates.<br>
US 5,399,722 describe a process starting from commercially available ethyl w-cloroacetoacetate or its benzyloxy derivative. The disadvantages of this process are that a stereo selective reduction using a costly ruthenium-BINAP catalyst in employed and the desired compound of formula 1 is obtained in six steps.<br>
US 5,481,009 describe a process starting from 4-phenyl-3-butenoic acid in about 5 steps. The process uses expensive materials like - N, 0-Dimethyl hydroxylamine and hazardous steps (ozonolysis) to obtain the desired product.<br>
US 5,998,633 describes a process for the preparation of protected esters of 3,4-dihydroxy butyric acid from a carbohydrate moiety which is transformed Into the desired 3,4-dihydroxy butanolc acid derivatives in about 4 steps. The 3.4-dihvdroxv hutanoir arid<br><br>
derivative is then functionalized into compounds of formula I involving a multiple number of steps.<br>
US 6,140,527 describes a process for producing butyric acid derivatives starting from a butene derivative followed by reaction with an addition reagent capable of adding across the double bond. However, this procedure does not afford chiral molecules and hence necessitates the need for a resolution step.<br>
EP 0 104 750 describes a process for the preparation of 5-hydroxy-3-oxo pentanoic acid derivatives by alkylation of 3-hydroxybutyrate derivatives. The derivatives mentioned in this patent are racemic molecules and thus necessitating a resolution step.<br>
The objective of the present is to provide a simple and industrially scalable process for the preparation of derivatives of formula I starting from commercially available and inexpensive malic acid.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
To achieve the said object the present invention provides a product of formula Ila and more particularly a compound of formula II<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ar = unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl<br>
R3 = alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons, aryl or aralkyl<br>
R4 = 0, OH, CN or a halogen and<br>

(a)	reacting compound of formula III with the anion of tertiary<br>
butyl acetate to give a compound of formula IV, where G is<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyldimethyl silyl or trityl and R3 is<br>
alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons, aryl or aralkyi,<br><br>
(b)	subjecting compound of formula IV to reduction to give a<br>
compound of formula V, where G is tetrahydropyranyl, tert-<br>
butyldimethyl silyl or trityl and R3 is alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons,<br>
aryl or aralkyi.<br><br><br>

( f) deprotection of the compound of formula VI using mild acid catalyst to give a compound of formula II.<br>
Said ArB(0H)2 is boronic acid.<br>
The compound of formula II is oxidized to a compound of formula VIII, where R3 is alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons, aryl or aralkyi and Ar is unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl using pyridinium chioro chromate or DMSO/oxalyl chloride.<br><br>
The compound of formula II is further converted to a compound of formula IX, where R3 is alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons, aryl or aralkyi, Ar is unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl and X is a halogen.<br><br><br>
The compound of formula IX is further converted to a compound of formula VII, where R3 Is alkyl from 1 to 8 carbons, aryl or aralkyi, Ar is unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heteroaryl.<br><br>
The product of formula Ila and more particularly of formula II are used in the synthesis of atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin. Detailed Description of the invention<br>

Compound of formula II can be converted into a facile leaving group by treating with tosyl chloride, methane sulfonyl chloride and the resulting intermediate can be displaced with cyanide to give compounds of formula VII.<br>
Compound of formula II can be converted to formula IX by reacting with aqueous HBr solution or by reaction with triphenyl phosphine and CBr4 which is then converted to compound of formula VII.<br><br>
Compound of formula II can be oxidized using standard procedures to give a compound of formula VIII.<br>
