				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method according to the<br>
features of the preamble of the main claim. Specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to a method for machining a<br>
workpiece by means of a rotating cutting tool (or machining<br>
tool or metal-cutting tool), wherein the tool is moved along<br>
paths relative to the workpiece.<br>
The underlying prior art shall now be described in connection<br>
with the figures, of which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration showing a machining<br>
process on a transition portion of a workpiece;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the machining process of a workpiece along a<br>
plurality of paths;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a typical workpiece geometry for use in the<br>
present invention; and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a faulty transition region according to the<br>
prior art.<br>
When workpieces are machined by way of milling or grinding,<br>
the tool geometry depends on the geometry of the workpiece. To<br><br>
be more specific, the inner radii in the workpiece determine<br>
the maximum outer diameter of the tool that can be used. When<br>
freeforms are produced in toolmaking and die construction by<br>
milling with spherical milling tools, the radius of the<br>
milling tool, for instance, must always be smaller than or<br>
equal to the minimum inner radius in the surface so as to be<br>
able to produce the same. Otherwise, an undesired residual<br>
material remains in the inner radii of the workpiece after<br>
machining.<br>
Fig. 1 shows such a machining state in a workpiece 1 the<br>
surface of which passes from a horizontal region into an<br>
inclined flank. During machining with the help of a rotating<br>
tool 2, which has a semicircular cross-section on its front<br>
end, residual material 5 remains in the channel.<br>
On the other hand, it is desired to use a tool that is as<br>
large as possible for the machining operation to achieve<br>
machining times that are as short as possible, for the tool<br>
radius defines the possible lateral infeed together with a<br>
desired surface quality. The greater the radius of the<br>
machining tool, the larger can also be the lateral infeed<br>
(with the same surface quality on the workpiece), i.e., for<br>
instance, during milling with spherical tools, the line<br>
spacing between the individual tool paths. The greater the<br>
possible infeed or the line spacing, the shorter is the<br>
machining program and thus also the machining time.<br>
Fig. 2 shows this state in which the different paths which are<br>
parallel to one another are outlined by means of the contour<br>
of the tool 2. It is evident that a residual material 5 which<br>
leads to a residual roughness R remains between the individual<br>
paths.<br>
There are many workpiece geometries in the case of which the<br>
smallest inner radii are only present in a small portion of<br><br>
the workpiece. In such workpiece, it would be very uneconomic to<br>
carry out the whole machining operation with the machining tool<br>
predetermined by the smallest inner radius. As a rule, two or<br>
more tools are used, a large one for machining the portions<br>
having large radii of curvature, for which a larger infeed can be<br>
chosen, and a small tool for machining the geometry portions that<br>
can only be machined by said tool. This leads to shorter machining<br>
times due ot the larger infeed in the larger tool.<br>
Fig. 3 shows such a workpiece situation in which a groove-like<br>
recess with a relatively small radius must be incorporated.<br>
The above-described procedure has the drawback that due to<br>
inaccuracies during measurement of the machining tools in the<br>
machine, due to different cutting characteristics (i.e. differemt<br>
cutting pressures) and other effects, small steps are created on<br>
the surface of the workpieces, even in cases where the machining<br>
tool executes the programs with an ideal accuracy* which in<br>
practice cannot be achieved either. These undesired steps require<br>
an increased manual finishing operation, particularly in surfaces<br>
which must have polishing quality. The steps must be adapted in<br>
the finishing operation and eliminated in this way, e.g. by<br>
polishing.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows this situation where a step A is specifically<br>
illustrated, which is due to the use of the illustrated tool 2<br>
with the smaller diameter.<br>
US Patent No.4,764,878 discloses a surface cutting method for<br>
back-and-forth surface cutting of the interior of an area (AR)<br>
bounded by a closed curve.<br>
The surface cutting method comprises repeating the following<br>
steps:<br>
a step of obtaining points of intersection Pi, Qi between an i-th<br>
cutting path (PT; ) and an offset curve offset (OFC') by<br>
(T+C+R+) to the outer side of the closed curve , as well as<br>
points of intersection Pi+1, Qi+1 between the offset<br>
curve and an (i+l)th cutting path (PT/+, ), where T, C and R<br>
represent excess thickness, amount of clearance and tool<br>
radius, respectively;<br>
a step of obtaining a coordinate value, in the cutting path<br>
direction, of an outermost ooint R on the offset curve<br>
(OFC) between the points of intersection Qi Qi+1, where Qi<br>
is a point of intersection on a cutting end point side of the<br>
i-th cutting path (PTi ) and Qi+1 is a point of intersection<br><br>
on a cutting starting point side of the (i+l)th cutting path<br>
path (PTi+1);<br>
a step of performing surface cutting by moving a tool along the<br>
i-th cutting path until a coordinate value of the position<br>
of the tool in the cutting path direction coincides with the<br>
coordinate value of the point Ri in the cutting path direct-<br>
ion; and<br>
a step of moving the tool at a cutting velocity to the next<br>
(i + l)th cutting path (PTi+1) in a shift direction.<br>
It is an abject of the present invention to provide a method of<br>
the above-mentioned type which, while being of a simple<br>
configuration and being easily applicable at low costs, avoids<br>
the drawbacks of the prior art and particularly creates a good<br>
workpiece surface.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for machining<br>
a workpiece by means of a plurality of rotating cutting<br>
tools in which the respective tool is moved along paths relative<br>
to the workpiece. Limits of machining portions to be machined<br>
in direction of processing by means of at least one tool are<br>
determined, in that within the range of the limits of machining<br>
portions to be machined by means of the tool an infeed and/or<br>
lifting movement of the tool is defined in direction toward the<br>
workpiece or away therefrom, in that the infeed or lifting<br>
movement during machining of the workpiece is carried out within<br>
the range of the limits of machining portions to be machined by<br>
means of the tool, and in that the infeed and/or lifting movement<br>
is carried out such that a tangential or quasi tangential run-in<br>
or runout of the tool into and out of the workpiece takes place.<br>
It is thus provided that the limits of machining portions to be<br>
machined by means of at least one respective tool are first<br>
determined, that an infeed and/or lifting movement of the tool is<br>
then defined within the range of said limits, and that the infeed<br>
and/or lifting movement is carried out or realized during<br>
machining of the workpiece within the range of said limits.<br><br>
The method according to the invention is distinguished by a<br>
number of considerble advantages.<br>
According to the invention, the machining programs are modified<br>
in the controller of the machine in compliance with the<br>
operator's instructions or also already in the programming<br>
system, the CAM system, such that the undesired steps of<br>
shoulders are avoided and surfaces which are machined on a<br>
workpiece by different tools and shall converge tangentially<br>
actually converge tangentially.<br>
In a particularly advantageous configuration of the method<br>
according to the invention, the machining limits are defined such<br>
that an overlap of neighboring machining portions is obtained.<br>
Hence, the portions which have been machined by different<br>
machining tools overlap one another on the workpiece*. In<br>
addition, the tool paths can be modified in the edge portion<br>
of the machining operation of a program according to the<br>
invention such that the machining tool during machining<br>
minimally moves away from the desired workpiece surface at<br>
the places where it approaches the edge of the machining<br>
portion of the respective machining program. This slight "lifting<br><br>
movement" must be very small, so that no undesired "kinks" are<br>
created in the surface. When this method is used in machining<br>
operations with programs for two different machining tools<br>
that overlap one another, a "quasi tangential" transition is<br>
created on the workpiece surface in the portion that has been<br>
produced by the two machining tools although these do not<br>
produce exactly the same dimension on the workpiece.<br>
In toolmaking and die construction, the machining programs for<br>
a portion of a workpiece are often configured in a meandering<br>
fashion. In these meandering programs, the controller can<br>
determine the edge portions of the machining operation through<br>
a simple geometry analysis that is calculated online during<br>
machining. A meandering machining operation normally includes<br>
four edge portions, similar to the four sides of a rectangle,<br>
which must be modified for this purpose. One side is defined<br>
by the beginning of the machining operation and must be<br>
equated with the beginning of the machining program. Another<br>
side is produced by the program end and can be easily<br>
recognized with the help of a corresponding forecast (look-<br>
ahead function as is known in modern controllers). The two<br>
other sides are distinguished by the line spacing in the<br>
program and can e.g. be recognized easily by way of a simple<br>
geometrical analysis in the machining plane. In the meander a<br>
directional reversal of about 180 degrees is carried out in<br>
the program with an intermediate step for translation into the<br>
next line. This geometry characterizes the translation into<br>
the next machining line in an unambiguous manner and can be<br>
reliably recognized in the controller with the help of simple<br>
mathematical functions. In the non-meandering machining<br>
operations, similar criteria can be found for recognizing the<br>
edge portions of a machining operation.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to define the edge portions of a<br>
machining operation also on the screen, e.g. with the help of<br>
a simulation program which displays the tool paths on the<br><br>
screen. By plotting simple auxiliary lines, the beginning of<br>
the edge portions can be defined by the operator. The degree<br>
of the lifting movement can be defined through further simple<br>
data, e.g. the pitch in 0.001 mm / 1 mm.<br>
The definition of the limits for the machining operation or<br>
the edge portions for the machining operation can thus be<br>
carried out by the user, so to speak "manually". However, it<br>
is also possible to have these limits defined "automatically"<br>
by the machining program.<br>
The lifting of the tool in the edge portions of a machining<br>
operation is carried out according to the invention in a<br>
favorable configuration of the invention in a direction normal<br>
to the surface of the workpiece to be produced. To this end it<br>
is possible to consult the normal vectors indicated by the<br>
programming system auxiliarily in the machining program, said<br>
vectors defining the normal to the workpiece surface at the<br>
respective program point.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible according to the invention to<br>
calculate a simulation of the machining operation online in<br>
the controller. The simulation calculates online the machining<br>
progress on the workpiece with the help of the geometry data<br>
of the machining tool that are known in the controller, and<br>
can detect on the basis thereof how the inclination of the<br>
workpiece surface is positioned at the respective machining<br>
point in space and can thus detect the lifting direction. An<br>
online simulation can also be used for detecting the edge<br>
portions of a machining operation. To this end, an adequately<br>
dimensioned look-ahead function (forecast) must just be<br>
provided for determining the program end.<br>
It is also possible in a simplified manner according to the<br>
invention to define a tool axis or any desired other fixed<br><br>
direction in space as a lifting direction. This method is<br>
adequate in very flat machining operations.<br>
According to the invention, it is also advantageous to carry<br>
out not only a lifting movement, but also a slow infeed, e.g.<br>
at the beginning of the program. Due to the lifting or infeed<br>
movement of the machining tool, a slight change in the<br>
machining process is accomplished. This leads to a slight<br>
change in the workpiece geometry. The lifting or infeed<br>
movement is ideally carried out by the controller such that a<br>
tangential transition, if possible without any kinks or bends,<br>
is created towards the machining portion where no lifting<br>
movement is carried out. The workpiece geometry changed by the<br>
lifting movement can be configured in linearly ascending<br>
fashion towards the edge of the machining portion of a<br>
program. Of course, any other mathematical functions are<br>
possible, e.g. parabolas.<br>
The described modifications in the machining program can of<br>
course also be carried out in the CAM system or the<br>
programming system, instead of the controller.<br>
When a linear lifting geometry of the edge portion of the<br>
machining operation is used, this can very easily be defined<br>
by the input of a dimension, e.g. 0.002 mm / 1 mm for the<br>
pitch and 5 mm for the width of the edge portion. This means<br>
that with every millimeter with which the machining operation<br>
approaches the edge, the tool would lift by 0.002 mm from the<br>
workpiece surface, starting 5 mm away from the edge of the<br>
machining operation and ending at a lift height of 0.01 mm on<br>
the edge. Of course, the lifting movement is continuous while<br>
the tool is moving towards the edge. This is also true for the<br>
infeed movement when the tool moves again away from the edge<br>
of the machining operation.<br><br>
There are also machining strategies in the case of which the<br>
machining portion has only two sides and the lifting movement<br>
can and must therefore also be carried out at two sides only,<br>
for instance, in the case of an annular machining portion.<br>
Geometrically speaking, this portion has only two boundary<br>
sides, the inner circle and the outer circle. Of course, any<br>
other desired shapes of the machining portion are also<br>
possible and the above-described lifting strategy must then be<br>
adapted thereto accordingly so as to avoid steps on the<br>
surface. In the case of possible translatory movements in the<br>
machining programs these must also be recognized and taken<br>
into account. This may e.g. be required in the case of islands<br>
in the machining portion. An additional edge portion will then<br>
be created around said islands.<br>
If it is known that a tool presses more away in the machining<br>
operation than another one that is machining a neighboring<br>
portion, i.e., the first tool does not produce the desired<br>
dimension due to increased machining forces, but an allowance<br>
or oversize is created during machining, such behavior can be<br>
compensated in addition by the controller in that the whole<br>
machining operation of said tool is carried out in the<br>
direction of the workpiece surface at a slightly deeper level.<br>
For such a machining operation that is performed deeper by a<br>
desired dimension, the inventive correction of the edge<br>
portions for avoiding steps can nevertheless be carried out.<br>
The invention shall now be described in the following with<br>
reference to embodiments taken in conjunction with the<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 5 is a simplified schematic illustration of the<br>
transition portions and of the infeed movement or<br>
lifting movement according to the invention;<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows a meandering path of movement of a tool<br>
according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 7 shows a selection of a machining portion by way of<br>
an optical definition;<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic illustration of the normal vectors;<br>
and<br>
Fig. 9 is a schematic illustration showing a runout<br>
movement when the machining limit has been reached.<br>
In the figures, like parts are designated by like reference<br>
numerals.<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic illustration by analogy with the<br>
illustration of Fig. 4, which shows a workpiece 1 with a<br>
horizontal surface and a transition to an inclined flank. For<br>
avoiding the step A as shown in Fig. 4, a tangential runout of<br>
the preceding tool and a tangential run-in of the subsequent<br>
tool having a smaller diameter take place according to the<br>
invention in an overlap region L. In the case of a path-like<br>
machining operation progressing from the left side according<br>
to Fig. 5 (see also Fig. 2), a tangentially directed lifting<br>
or runout movement takes place along path T1. This leads to the<br>
contour shown in broken line, which is achieved by the<br>
preceding tool (not shown) having a larger diameter. Following<br>
a toolchange a subsequent tool having a smaller diameter is<br>
slowly fed along a path T2. This results in a slow tangential<br>
run-in of the tool. Fig. 5 shows the situation in a strongly<br>
exaggerated manner to illustrate the process. It goes without<br>
saying that according to the invention in an optimum<br>
configuration of the method there is no step or transition<br>
inclination.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a meandering tool movement along a workpiece<br>
surface. It becomes apparent that four machining limits are<br><br>
provided on the whole in each meandering movement, the four<br>
limits being illustrated in the figure by G1, G2, G3 and G4. It<br>
is of course also possible to define and plot these limits in<br>
a different way, for instance over the whole area of the<br>
workpiece surface to be machined in a meandering way.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further variant in which the limits of the<br>
portion to be machined are chosen manually, e.g. on the<br>
screen. This portion is indicated by the lines marked by "G".<br>
The path of movement of the tool is designated by "3" in Figs.<br>
6 and 7.<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic illustration showing a convex	surface of<br>
a tool 1 for which several normal vectors 4	have been<br>
schematically plotted in the direction of which the	lifting or<br>
infeed movement is to be carried out.<br>
The normal vectors 4 are normal, i.e. perpendicular, to the<br>
workpiece surface.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a schematic illustration of the lifting movement<br>
of a tool along a lifting path T1 (by analogy with the<br>
illustration of Fig. 5) . As can be seen, a linear lifting<br>
geometry can be observed according to the invention on the<br>
edge portion of the machining operation to provide a smooth<br>
transition to a subsequent machining portion.<br><br>
