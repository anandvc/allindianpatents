				<td>1A OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a telephone set which enjoys fundamental new characteristics and remarkable advantages with respect to similar known devices used for the same purpose in the present state of technology.<br>
More specifically, the telephone set consists of a device intended for, primarily, use as a public terminal, particularly in supervised environments, which has been adapted to admit as a means of payment for the different calls made by any of the existing cards, and which has as an additional characteristic that all electronics for controlling the different functions of the set have been built on a single circuit board, with the consequent saving in production costs and an increased ease of maintenance of said terminal.<br>
The field of application of the present invention obviously lies in the industry dedicated to manufacturing and installation of telephone sets for public use.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As has been previously mentioned, the present invention proposes the development of a telephone terminal presenting a remarkable simplification in construction and resulting in a truly versatile device as far as concerns ease of use and means of payment. The telephone set of the invention has means of<br><br>
1B<br>
recognizing the different intelligent cards which exist in the market, such as the electronic money purse, EPROM and EEPROM types, including the possibility of installation as an extension in private customer switchboards (such as hospitals).<br>
The present invention provides a telephone set, of the type used for public use, which may be installed Indoors as a private customer switchboard extension, said telephone set comprising: a Modular Telephone Management System which establishes communication with a Modular Telephone Exploitation System for sending information about identification, alarms, daily routine and detailed billing sent by the telephone set to a remote exchange; tone dialing or multifrequency means, which provide total access to the network which allows it to be connected to any type of exchange or switchboard; electric detection means to detect possible frauds; means for accepting payments corresponding to different cards in the market (Electronic Money Purse, EEPROM, EPROM), with sockets for safety module incorporation; functional elements and devices adapted to help the user, such as a message display, function keys, messages in the language of choice, adjusting of receiving volume and the like; means for admitting all types of calls, and a connection to an external modem, said terminal being built so that all the circuitry needed for correct operation is set in a single circuit board, with the corresponding advantages in maintenance of the set.<br>
The principal characteristics which define this terminal are the following: The   operation   of  said   terminal is    controlled    by    the    Modular<br>
Telephone    Management System (SGTM for short), the set establishing<br><br>
2<br>
communication with the Modular Telephone Exploitation System (SETM for short) to send identity information, alarms, daily routine and detailed billing;<br>
It presents total access to the network, and so it may be connected to any type of exchange or switchboard;<br>
It is powered by the current on the telephone system, with no need of additional power;<br>
It may detect possible frauds electronically;<br>
It allows the use of the different means of payment mentioned above, that is, Electronic Money Purse, EPROM card and EEPROM card. It incorporated up to 4 sockets for connecting safety modules for intelligent card validation;<br>
It has devices and functional elements for aiding the user (message screen, messages in desired language, receiving volume control, etc.)<br>
It performs and admits all types of calls, and<br>
It has a connection for an external modem.<br>
Based on the terminal's characteristics, the main advantages it presents are the following:<br>
All operations mentioned above are performed by the electronics contained in a single circuit board, remarkably simplifying the set's maintenance operations;<br>
The terminals are managed by an existing public telephone system, specifically the SGTM, which has been adapted to the characteristics of these terminals so that they may be connected to the aforementioned system;<br>
With the purpose that the terminal may be connected as a switchboard extension in exchanges whose bandwidth does not allow pass of billing information, between the digital exchange and the exchanges from which the extensions depend, a conversion is introduced by an impulse translator at the same frequency, also incorporating filters and detectors in the terminal;<br>
The system introduces protections against fraudulent use, which depends on the operation environment and limit, to the extent possible,<br><br>
3<br>
introduction of devices in the connection line which may commit fraudulent calls, and<br>
Other functions may be associated to the normal operation of the telephone set. For example, in the event that the set of the invention is used in hospital rooms it may also serve to control other devices, such as the television set.<br>
Since the set is incorporated as a terminal in the SGTM, as mentioned above, due to its functionality and operativeness it shall communicate, within the system structure, with the following devices:<br>
Modular Telephone Exploitation System (SETM for short) and/or the Modular Telephone Maintenance System (CMTM for short), informing of failures, billing, daily routine, activations, disactivations, etc. and<br>
Validation and Billing Centre (CVF for short) through the Modular Telephone Access Units (UATM for short) in order to send Load and Block messages to the intelligent cards.<br>
Because of its functionality, the set shall not be connected to the Validation and Identification Unit (UVI).<br>
Another special characteristic inherent to the operation of the set lies in that the different means of payment admitted (in particular the card types mentioned above) are locally validated, that is, in the set itself. Cards which require authentication by a secret code shall have the corresponding safety module. Furthermore, it shall allow any type of outgoing call to be made, through its connection to the Basic Telephone Network (RTB). In addition, incoming calls shall be admitted, and as an option there is the possibility of remote control in real time from the SETM/CMTM. The power to the same shall come exclusively from the telephone couple, admitting billing at a frequency of 12 kHz and detecting the change in polarity. In addition, parameters shall be teleloaded from the SETM/CMTM.<br><br>
4<br>
As regards the physical arrangement of the set program, it shall ideally have the following options:<br>
-Reside in EPROM memory, so that to change the program it is necessary to physically replace the program memory;<br>
Reside in RAM memory, so that the program may be changed in two ways:<br>
a)	By connecting it to a portable terminal, which may be<br>
connected to the internal data connector which has been installed in<br>
the telephone set, or<br>
b)	By modem, from a distance.<br>
As regards the projected means of operation for the terminal, there will be two independent modes which are:<br>
-	Residential: its functioning is identical to a private terminal, with no need<br>
to introduce a means of payment to call, and<br>
-	Public: payment of calls is performed in the already described manner,<br>
that is, by the cards.<br>
The default mode of the two mentioned shall be the public mode, so that when a specific card (EEPROM) is inserted in the reader it shall change over to residential mode, remaining in this mode of operation during the time this card remains inserted in the reader or the set is unhooked. This card is univocally identified with the terminal so that it may not be used to change the operation mode in other terminals.<br>
The equipment shall in addition have a maintenance program independent of the operation program, so that entry into this program is performed by introducing a Technician card (EEPROM) in the reader, or by the insertion of an appropriate connector in the internal data connector of the device. The function of this maintenance program shall mainly consist of:<br>
Generation of connection, tilting, parameter requests and billing messages to be communicated to the SETM/CMTM;<br><br>
5<br>
-	Activating cards which allow the operation mode to change to residential<br>
mode;<br>
-	Display of statistics on calls made in public mode, parameters teleloaded<br>
and alarms, and<br>
-	Performance of automatic tests of the card reader, real time clock or<br>
tones.<br>
The invention has designed the set to have an external modem Bell connector, a data connector for connection to an external set and a display intended to show any warning and information message.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
To complement the description being made and to aid in a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention, the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein in an illustrative and nonlimiting way the following is shown:<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show views of the representative block diagram of the circuit of the present invention, and<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of a practical embodiment of the telephone set of the invention.<br><br>
5A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the preferred embodiment shown schematically in block diagrams of figures 1 and 2, the circuitry required for a correct operation of the set in the manner described above is built around a microcontroller block which includes a microprocessor (1) and some pin expansion peripherals which give a set of inputs/outputs needed to control the different functions to be performed by the remaining peripherals. The microprocessor is activated with the device, initializing the expansion ports to be configured as inputs or outputs, in order to detect the events and control the appropriate activities of or to the interface unit.<br><br>
6<br>
Electrically connected to the microcontroller block is a new block (2) which represents the RAM memory, applicable both as a program memory and as a data memory, and in the preferred embodiment the RAM memory is write protected by block (3), or EPLD block, in charge of giving directions to the remaining peripherals. As an option, it may include an EPROM program memory. The latter has been represented as block (2a). Also in agreement with the preferred embodiment, blocks (2, 2a) may be of the type which give 64 Kbytes RAM memory for the program, 64 Kbytes RAM memory for data and parameters and 64 Kbytes EPROM memory for the program. Thus, the aforementioned block (3) is electrically connected both to the RAM and EPROM memories enclosed in blocks (2, 2a), respectively, and to the READ and WRITE connections of the microprocessor in block (1).<br>
Furthermore, block (3) incorporates the memory map change as seen by the processor in block (1) executed in user program or teleload mode.<br>
Block (4) shows an L-C type filter block, which is electrically connected to both the telephone line (5) and the detector block (6). These blocks are meant to filter and detect billing pulses of a certain frequency, which is settable by the software. In the embodiment chosen, this frequency shall preferably be 12 kHz or 3.1 kHz. Block (18) shows the protections for the system, and is electrically connected to the junction node of the line (5), the filter block (4) and a block (12) which indicates the hang-up source, as is shown below.<br>
The display block is shown as (7) and is in charge of presenting visual information on certain topics such as credits and expenditure of the cards or coins, or on the maintenance menus of the sets.<br>
As seen in the figures, this block is electrically connected to the microcontroller (1), and shall preferably have a means of control for on and off.<br>
Block (8) shows schematics of the readers for the different types of cards used with the terminal, which have an internal microswitch for detecting the end of introduction of the card. Connected to microcontroller (1), this block shall also include means of generating a 21V voltage required as programming voltage for certain cards. Furthermore, the block shall include a circuit in charge of detecting<br><br>
7<br>
wired fraudulent cards. It also has a bank of several safety modules to access open purses, represented by block (9).<br>
Block (10) consists of a ring detector, in charge of controlling the "waking" of the main processor included in block (1), in order to answer the incoming call and allow the remote questioning of the terminal. This detector is programmable by software, and may be also disconnected by said software.<br>
Block (11) represents a modem through which operations of teleloading may be performed by the telephone lines, both of software and operation parameters.<br>
Block (12) represents the hang-up source. This source allows the processor to have a minimum power source until it connects to the line.<br>
In addition, block (13) represents the real time clock signal generator, and includes an independent power source, such as a battery, by which electrical power Is supplied to the program memory if the set is disconnected from the telephone line.<br>
In both figures are also shown other blocks, not yet mentioned, which are the following: block (14) consists of a tone generating device, whose frequency in this embodiment is 800 and 1,600 Hz, which is shown connected to microcontroller (1) and modem (11) through a block (15) representing the means for the mute function and variable gain; block (16) represents the dialling device, and is shown connected to microcontroller (1), while block (17) is a schematic representation of the hook in the power circuit, electrically connected at its entry to telephone line (5) and providing at the exit (17a) the continuous power voltage desired. This hook is intended for hanging-up and picking-up, as well as the new call function by a quick action on it. It is not of the type creating a physical opening or closing f the line, rather its state is analysed by the system, the latter being in charge of the final decision on the state it is in.<br>
Other blocks which appear are (19, 20, 21). Block (19) has voltage supervising devices and the control logic, with connections to the microcontroller which make up the reset and backup terminals, and is also connected to the<br><br>
8<br>
direction block (3).Block (20), electrically connected to microcontroller (1), represents a connection for the external modem, and finally, block (21) represents a connection for teleloading of parameters and maintenance, electrically connected to both the microcontroller (1) and the direction block (3).<br>
Looking at Figure 3, a practical realisation of a telephone set of the present invention is shown, in a purely illustrative manner, in two perspective views from the top and bottom of the set. As this figure shows, the terminal may be built with a case of reduced dimensions, and its different elements are accessible both from the top and bottom, as seen in both views. Thus, as shown in the top view, one may appreciate that the set includes conventionally a handset (30) which shall preferably be connected by a flexible cable (not shown) to said case, placed along a side marginal area, on the slot exit for the telephone buzzer, as well as a numeric keyboard (32) for dialling, which shall preferably have the corresponding numbers and two additional keys (* and #) to be used in the test program and in data mode. It also incorporates a set of function keys (33) intended in the preferred embodiment for language changing, volume adjusting, card change and new call functions.<br>
As may be seen, the inclusion of a hanging hook (34) device has been foreseen for cases when the set is used in a vertical position, as well as a display (35) in charge of furnishing the user during normal operation with the normal messages, as well as providing messages for the maintenance personnel when in test mode. This display is protected in the preferred embodiment by a glass of adequate characteristics. Slot (36), which may be used for introducing the different types of cards which are used with this set (EPROM, EEPROM and money purses) is shown on the side opposite the handset (30) and in a horizontal position.<br>
On the bottom side, as shown in the complementary view in Figure 3, the terminal has housings (37) for adapting to the base support, preferably four housings placed near the corners, as well as housings (38) for the tabs of the card support. Reference (39) indicates an exit channel on the lower face of the set case for the line cable; reference (40) shows a similar channel for the internal data cable, and (41) shows a outlet channel for the handset connector, this connector being located at the reference point (42). On a side of the case is a new connector<br><br>
9<br>
(43) for external data, while the connector labelled (44) opposite channel (39) is designed for the line cable. Next to this connector is a device (45) for adjusting the ringing volume, and in front of channel (40) is an internal data connector (46).<br><br>
