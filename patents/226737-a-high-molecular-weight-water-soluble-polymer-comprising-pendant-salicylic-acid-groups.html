				<td>HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYMERS CONTAINING FINDANT<br>
SALICYLIC ACID GROUPS FOR CLARIFYING BAYER PROCESS<br>
LIQUORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is directed to high molecular weight polymers comprising<br>
pendant salicylic acid groups and a method of using the polymers for clarifying red<br>
mud-containing liquors generated in the Bayer process for the recovery of alumina<br>
from bauxite.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Bayer process is almost universally used for the production of alumina<br>
from bauxite ore. The process involves pulverizing a bauxite ore, sharing it in caustic<br>
soda solution and digesting it at elevated temperatures and pressures. The caustic soda<br>
solution dissolves oxides of aluminum to form an aqueous sodium aJuminate solution.<br>
The caustic-insoluble constituents of bauxite ore (referred to as "red mud") are then<br>
separated from the aqueous phase containing the dissolved sodium aluminate. This<br>
separation typically occurs through sedimentation, which is often aided by a flocculant,<br>
and filtration. Once separated, alumina trihydrate is precipitated from the aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide and collected as product.<br>
In more detail, the pulverized bauxite ore is fed to a slurry mixer where a<br>
caustic slurry is prepared. The slurry makeup caustic soda solution is typically spent<br>
liquor (described below) and additional caustic soda. The bauxite ore slurry is diluted<br>
and passed through a digester or a series of digesters where, under high pressure and<br>
temperature, about 98% of the total available alumina is released from the ore as<br>
caustic-soluble sodium aluminate. After digestion, the slurry passes through several<br>
flash tanks wherein the pressure of the digested slurry is reduced from several<br>
atmospheres to one atmosphere and the temperature of the slurry is reduced from about<br>
200°C to about 105°C.<br><br>
The aluminate slurry leaving the flashing operation contains about 1 to 20<br>
weight percent solids, which solid consists of the insoluble residue that remains after,<br>
or is precipitated during, digestion. The coarser solids may be removed from the<br>
aluminate liquor with "sand trap" cyclones. The finer solids are generally separated<br>
from the liquor first by gravity settling aided by a flocculant and then filtration, if<br>
necessary. In some cases, the slurry of aluminate liquor leaving the flash tanks is<br>
diluted by a stream of recycled washer overflow liquor. Any Bayer process slurry<br>
taken from the digesters through a subsequent dilution of the slurry, including the flash<br>
tanks, but before the primary settler, is referred to hereinafter as the primary settler<br>
feed.<br>
Normally, the primary settler feed is thereafter fed to the primary settler (or<br>
decanter) where it is treated with a flocculant As the mud settles, the clarified sodium<br>
aluminate solution (referred to as "green" or "pregnant" liquor) overflows to a weir at<br>
the top of the vessel and is collected. This overflow from the primary settling tank is<br>
then passed to subsequent process steps.<br>
The clarity of the primary settler overflow is crucial to efficient processing of<br>
alumina trihydrate. If the aluminate liquor overflowing the settler contains an<br>
unacceptable concentration of suspended solids (at tiroes from about 10 to about 500<br>
mg suspended solids per liter), it must be further clarifled by filtration to give a filtrate<br>
with no more than 10 mg suspended solids per liter of liquor. The treatment of the<br>
liquor collected after the primary settlement to remove any residual suspended solids<br>
before alumina trihydrate is recovered is referred to as a secondary clarification stage.<br>
The clarified sodium aluminate liquor is cooled and seeded with alumina<br>
trihydrate crystals to induce precipitation of alumina in the form of alumina trihydrate,<br>
Al(OH)3. The alumina trihydrate particles or crystals are then classified by particle<br>
size and separated from the concentrated caustic liquor. A flocculant is used to aid in<br>
this classification and separation process. The very fine particles of alumina trihydrate<br>
are returned as the seed crystals and the coarser particles are collected as product. The<br>
remaining liquid phase, referred to as "spent liquor," is then returned to the initial<br>
bauxite slurry make up and digestion step and employed as a digestant after<br>
reconstitution with caustic.<br>
The settled solids of the primary settler are withdrawn from the bottom of the<br><br>
settler or decanter (and referred to as "underflow') and then passed through a<br>
countercurrent washing circuit for the recovery of sodium aluminate and soda.<br>
Overflow liquor from the first washing vessel (or "thickener") is recycled either as<br>
primary settler feed, diluting the slurry as it leaves the flash tanks, and/or it may be<br>
passed to filtration along with the overflow from the primary settler.<br>
The partial separation of the red mud solids from the pregnant liquor in the<br>
primary settler (or decanter) is expedited by the use of a flocculant. This initial<br>
clarification of the pregnant liquor is referred to as the primary settler stage.<br>
Flocculating agents, such as liquid emulsion polymers, dry polymers and<br>
polysaccharides including starch, are commonly used to improve the separation of the<br>
insoluble red mud solids by increasing the rate at which these solids settle, by reducing<br>
the amount of residual solids suspended in the liquor, and by decreasing the amount of<br>
liquor in the settled solids phase, or underflow. Flocculation performance is critically<br>
important in the primary settling stages. Red mud solids comprised mostly of iron<br>
oxides (typically at least about SO weight percent of the red mud solids), together with<br>
silicon oxides, calcium titanates, calcium phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, sodium<br>
alumino-silicates and other materials, commonly represent from about 5 to about 50<br>
weight percent of the materials of the bauxite ore. Generally, these red mods are<br>
composed of very fine particles, which hinder the desired rapid and clean separation of<br>
the red mud particles from the solubilized alumina liquor. Improving the rate of<br>
separation improves the overall process efficiency and increases the output of alumina<br>
production. Improving the clarification of the process liquors reduces the need for<br>
filtration and further purification and can also increase alumina production. If the<br>
separation of the red mud particles is not clean, the resultant solubilized aluminate<br>
liquor will require a more extensive treatment to remove residual solids, and/or the<br>
alumina trihydrate recovered will contain levels of impurities that are undesirably high<br>
for many end-uses of the alumina.<br>
Relatively low molecular weight polymers containing pendant O-acetyisahrylic<br>
acid groups for use in biomedical devices arc disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,693.; 10.<br>
An acrylamide/4-acrylamidosalicylic acid solution polymer is disclosed in Jnten. J<br>
Polymeric Mater., 1992, 18, 165-177.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a high molecular weight, water-soluble polymer comprising<br>
pendant salicylic acid groups and having a weight average molecular weight of at least<br>
about 3,000,000 daltons.<br>
The polymers of this invention effectively flocculate suspended solids in Bayer<br>
process liquors. In particular, use of these polymers in Bayer process caustic<br>
aluminate streams reduces the suspended red mud solids and significantly reduces the<br>
need for filtration of the pregnant liquor. Lower solids in the overflow liquor also<br>
reduce the amount of impurities such as iron oxide and other minerals, thus improving<br>
the purity of the alumina produced during precipitation.<br>
The polymers of this invention also effectively clarify alumina trihydrate from<br>
Bayer process streams. During continuous or batch precipitation of the alumina<br>
trihydrate, coarse particles are separated from fine crystals primarily by gravity<br>
settling. A slurry of fine particles is sent to a series of secondary and tertiary clarifiers<br>
to concentrate the particles according to size. Flocculation and settling of the very fine<br>
particles is significantly improved by the addition of the polymers of this invention,<br>
resulting in reduced aluminum tri-hydrate solids in the spent liquor when compared<br>
with conventional processes, including the use of polysaccharides such as starch and<br>
dextran and/or combinations with polymers of acrylic acid and salts thereof<br>
The polymers of this invention show excellent affinity towards alumina<br>
trihydrate particles, flocculating such particles, and increasing the rate at which these<br>
particles settle. The very fine particles of alumina trihydrate can then be returned as<br>
seed crystals in the primary crystallization step. Use of the polymers of this inveaaon<br>
reduces the suspended fine aluminum tri-hydrate in the tertiary classifier overflow,<br>
thereby improving the recovery of the alumina, ensuring that less alumina is recyled<br>
to digestion with the spent liquor.<br><br>

Preferred Embodients<br>
The high molecular weight, water soluble polymer of this invention is<br>
preferably prepared by free radical polymerization of one or more salicylic acid<br>
containing monomers, one or more acrylate monomers selected from the group<br>
consisting of (meth)acrylic acid and salts thereof and alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid<br>
and optionally one or more polymerizable monomers selected from the group<br>
consisting of nonionic, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic monomers.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the polymer is selected from the group consisting<br>
of dispersion polymers, emulsion polymers, inverse emulsion polymers, dry polymers<br>
and solution polymers.<br>
"Dispersion polymer" means a water-soluble polymer dispersed in an aqueous<br>
continuous phase containing one or more inorganic salts. Representative examples of<br>
dispersion polymerization of water-soluble polymers in an aqueous continuous phase<br>
can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,929,655; 5,006,590; 5,597,859; and 5,597,858: and<br>
in European Patent Nos. 657,478; and 630,909.<br>
Dispersion polymers are prepared by combining water, one or more inorganic<br>
salts, one or more water-soluble monomers, any polymerization additives such as<br>
chelants, pH buffers or chain transfer agents, and a water-soluble stabilizer polymer.<br>
This mixture is charged to a reactor equipped with a mixer, a thermocouple, a nitrogen<br>
purging tube, and a water condenser. The monomer solution is mixed vigorously,<br>
heated to the desired temperature, and then a water-soluble initiator is added. The<br>
solution is purged with nitrogen whilst maintaining temperature and mixing for several<br>
hours. During the course of the reaction, a discontinuous phase containing the water-<br>
soluble polymer is formed. After this time, the products are cooled to room<br>
temperature, and any post-polymerization additives are charged to the reactor. Water<br>
continuous dispersions of water-soluble polymers are free flowing liquids with product<br>
viscosities generally 100-10,000 cP, as measured at low shear rates. The advantages of<br>
preparing water-soluble polymers as water continuous dispersions are similar to lk.se<br>
mentioned below in association with the inverse emulsion polymers. The wzter<br>
continuous dispersion polymers have the further advantages that they contain no<br>
hydrocarbon oil or surfactants, and require no surfactant for "inversion" or activation.<br><br>
"Inverse emulsion polymer" and "latex polymer" mean an invertible water-in-<br>
oil emulsion polymer consisting of an aqueous polymer phase dispersed as micron size<br>
particles in a hydrocarbon oil continuous phase, various emulsifying agents, and,<br>
potentially, an inverting surfactant. The advantages of polymerizing water-soluble<br>
monomers as inverse emulsions include 1) low fluid viscosity can be maintauaed<br>
throughout the polymerization, permitting effective mixing and heat removal, 2) the<br>
products can be pumped, stored, and used easily since the products remain liquids, and<br>
3) the polymer "actives" or "solids" level can be increased dramatically over simple<br>
solution polymers, which, for the high molecular weight flocculants, are linaited to<br>
lower actives because of viscosity considerations. The inverse emulsion polymers are<br>
then "inverted" or activated for use by releasing the polymer from the particles using<br>
shear, dilution, and, generally, another surfactant, which may or may not be a<br>
component of the inverse emulsion.<br>
Inverse emulsion polymers are prepared by dissolving the desired monomers in<br>
the aqueous phase, dissolving the emulsifying agent(s) in the oil phase, emulsifying the<br>
water phase in the oil phase to prepare a water-in-oil emulsion, in some cases,<br>
homogenizing the water-in-oil emulsion and polymerizing the monomers dissolved in<br>
the water phase of the water-in-oil emulsion to obtain the polymer as a water-in-oil<br>
emulsion. If so desired, a self-inverting surfactant can be added after the<br>
polymerization is complete in order to obtain the water-in-oil self-inverting emulsion.<br>
The oil phase comprises any inert hydrophobic liquid. Preferred hydrophobic<br>
liquids include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon liquids including benzene, xylene,<br>
toluene, paraffin oil, mineral spirits, kerosene, naphtha, and the like. Paraffin oil is<br>
preferred.<br>
Free radical yielding initiators such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide,<br>
Vazo ® 64, Vazo® 52, potassium persulfate and the like are useful in polymerizing<br>
vinyl and acrylic monomers. Vazo® 64 and Vazo® 52 are preferred The initiator is<br>
utilized in amounts ranging between about 0.002 and about 0.2 percent by weight of<br>
the monomers, depending upon the solubility of the initiator.<br>
Water-in-oil emulsifying agents useful for preparing the inverse emulsion<br>
polymers of this invention include sorbitan esters of fatty acids, ethoxylated sorbitan<br>
esters of fatty acids, and the like or mixtures thereof. Preferred emulsifying agents<br><br>
include sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearaie, and the like.<br>
Additional details on these agents may be found in McCutchcon's Detergents and<br>
Emulsifers. North American Edition, 1980. Any inverting surfactant or inverting<br>
surfactant mixture described in the prior art may be used. Representative inverting<br>
surfactants include ethoxylated nonylphenol, ethoxylated linear alcohols, and the like.<br>
Preferred inverting surfactants are ethoxylated linear alcohols.<br>
The polymer is prepared by polymerizing the appropriate monomers at from<br>
about 1 °C to about 85 °C over about 1 to about 24 hours, preferably at a temperature<br>
of from about 40 °C to about 70 °C over about 3 to about 6 hours.<br>
"Emulsion polymer" means a water-continuous dispersion of a water-insoluble<br>
polymer. The preparation of high molecular weight emulsion polymers such as<br>
poly(methyl acrylate) is described in U.S. 6,036,869. The polymer is rendered water<br>
soluble when activated with caustic solution to hydrolyze the ester groups and generate<br>
poly(sodium acrylate). Among the advantages of polymerizing in the water<br>
continuous format are that no hydrocarbon oil is present in the product (as is the case<br>
with the inverse emulsion systems), low viscosity fluids are obtained as products (
100 cP is typical), and spills are easily cleaned up since the polymer is not water<br>
soluble until activated.<br>
In the preparation of a water continuous dispersion, an aqueous mixture of one<br>
or more water soluble or water misciblc surfactants is prepared such that a<br>
homogeneous solution results. Thereafter, one or more water insoluble monomers are<br>
added to this mixture with shear such thai a water continuous emulsion is formed.<br>
After the emulsion has formed, the reaction vessel is cooled to below ambient<br>
temperature and purged with a nitrogen stream. After this, a stream of redox initiators<br>
are fed to the polymerization over time. Typical initiators include iron salts, peroxides<br>
and hydroperoxides, persulfates, bisulfites, and the like.<br>
A typical polymerization may last three to four hours, after which time the<br>
emulsion is allowed to warm to ambient temperature, filtered and transferred to<br>
storage. Once the polymers are hydrolyzed in caustic solution, they may be<br>
characterized by the measurement of a RSV in a fashion similar to the inverse<br>
emulsion polymers.<br>
"Dry polymer" means a polymer prepared by drying a polymer prepared by<br><br>
"gel" polymerization. The preparation of high molecular weight water-soluble<br>
polymers as dry powders using a gel polymerization is generally performed as follows:<br>
an aqueous solution of water-soluble monomers, generally 20-60 percent concentration<br>
by weight, along with any polymerization or process additives such as chain transfer<br>
agents, chelants, pH buffers, or surfactants, is placed in an insulated reaction vessel<br>
equipped with a nitrogen purging tube. A polymerization initiator is added, the<br>
solution is purged with nitrogen, and the temperature of the reaction is allowed to rise<br>
uncontrolled. When the polymerized mass is cooled, the resultant gel is removed from<br>
the reactor, shredded, dried, and ground to the desired particle size.<br>
Alternatively, dry polymers are prepared by spray drying emulsion, solution or<br>
dispersion polymers of this invention prepared as described herein.<br>
Although it is not possible to prepare concentrated solutions of the same high<br>
molecular weight polymers prepared as inverse emulsions, water continuous<br>
dispersions, or gel polymers owing to the extremely high viscosities which are<br>
encountered, it is sometimes desirable to prepare lower molecular weight polymers of<br>
similar composition as solutions in water. To conduct a solution polymerization of<br>
water soluble monomers, the desired monomers are dissolved in water, generally at<br>
concentrations between 5 and 40%, along with any buffers, acid or caustic, chelants,<br>
chain transfer agents. The solution is purged with nitrogen and heated to the<br>
polymerization temperature. After the polymerization temperature is reached, one or<br>
more water soluble initiators is added. These initiators may be either of the azo type or<br>
of the redox type. Then, depending on the desired polymer characteristics, the<br>
temperature is either allowed to rise uncontrolled (adiabatic) or is controlled with<br>
cooling to remove the heat generated (isothermal). After the polymerization is<br>
complete, the solution of polymer can be removed from the reaction vessel, transferred<br>
to storage and characterized.<br>

The polymer of this invention is also prepared by functionalizing natural or<br>
synthetic polymer with salicylic acid groups. For example, poly(acrylamide)<br>
containing pendant salicylic acid groups is prepared by Mannich reaction<br><br>
(formaldehyde, HCl) of poly(acrylamide). Similarly, naturally occurring polymers<br>
such as proteins can be functionalized with salicylic acid groups under Mannich<br>
conditions as described above. Alternatively, proteins and carbohydrates can be<br>
reacted with salicylic acid derivatives such as chlororoethylated salicylic acid to<br>
incorporate pendant salicylic acid groups into the polymer.<br>

Bayer process liquors generally are aqueous media containing dissolved<br>
sodium aluminate and red mud solids at various concentrations. Such liquors include<br>
the primary settler slurry or feed, which contains high concentration levels of both red<br>
mud and dissolved sodium aluminate, the red mud washing slurries, which have high<br>
red mud concentrations but lesser concentrations of sodium aluminate and total<br>
alkalinity, and the secondary clarification liquors, which are rich in dissolved sodium<br>
aluminate but contain much less red mud than the other types of liquors. Additional<br>
liquors include red mud slurries which are dewatered in centrifuges or on vacuum<br>
drum or disc filters, as well as red mud slurries which are flocculated to improve their<br>
mud stacking properties or to improve the tendency to release water from the mod<br>
slurry. As discussed above, the separation of the red mud from the sodium aluminate<br>
and its aqueous phase is continued from the primary settlement stage until<br>
concentrated red mud is eliminated from the process circuit, and from the primary<br>
settlement stage until the clarified liquor is subjected to the alumina trihydrate<br>
crystallization.<br>
The flocculation of red mud, which routinely precedes or follows either seeling<br>
or filtration, is most difficult in the primary settlement stage because of the high<br>
concentration of fine particles, and the high concentration of total alkalinity.<br>
Improvement of the flocculation effectiveness in the primary settlement stage is<br>
extremely important to the entire Bayer process. By reducing the level of suspence"<br>
solids that remain in the supernatant above the settled mud solids formed in the<br><br>
primary settler liquor, the solids to be removed during secondary clarification stages<br>
are reduced.<br>
In the Bayer process, the bauxite ore is digested under highly alkaline<br>
conditions, and the typical primary settler liquors are routinely highly alkaline,<br>
containing sodium hydroxide, sodium aluminate, and commonly sodium carbonate.<br>
The total alkalinity of the primary settler feed, that is the liquor charged to the<br>
primary settlement stage, is typically from about 100 to 300 grams per liter of settler<br>
feed, as sodium carbonate equivalent The solids contents of typical primary settler<br>
feeds vary from about 25 to about 85 grams per liter of settler feed.<br>
Primary settler feed means the Bayer process digested slurry as charged to the<br>
flash tanks or other vessels emptying into the primary settler. Such feed may be an<br>
admixture of the digested slurry plus dilution liquor, and the dilvtkn liquor is routinely<br>
the counter current technique wash water from the red mud washing stages discussed<br>
above. The primary settler feed differs from the liquors or shinies subjected to<br>
clarification and/or separation in the secondary clarification stage or the red mud<br>
washing stages by composition as to the solids content, dissolved sodium aluminate<br>
content, and total alkalinity. The primary settler feed also differs from the liquors or<br>
slurries in that no insoluble fraction thereof has received an earlier flocculation<br>
treatment.<br>
Accordingly, improved clarification of Bayer process primary settler liquors is<br>
one aspect of this invention. Nonetheless in its broadest sense, this invention is<br>
directed to the clarification and settling of red mud-containing liquors in any aspect of<br>
mineral processing wherein such red mud is found. For example, the polymers of this<br>
invention may be used in the counter-current wash liquors, primary settler liquors of<br>
the Bayer process, as well as in red mud which is dewatered in centrifuges or by<br>
vacuum filtration (drum filters, and disc filters among others) or in the settler overflow<br>
to improve filtration in the polishing filters (either pressure or sand filters) or in red<br>
mud which is flocculated after the last mud washing stage to improve the mod stacking<br>
properties in the mud disposal area, or in red mud which must be made useful for other<br>
purposes.<br>
Upon flocculation of a primary settler feed, using the polymers of this<br>
invention, a liquor/mud interface will form upon settling of the mud solids. The<br><br>
supernatant liquor is low in suspended solids (generally ranging from about 10 to about<br>
500 mg/l) and overlies a mod layer. The lower mud layer contains the flocculated<br>
material, and as discussed above, is comprised of both red mud solids (generally<br>
ranging from about 10 to about 70% mud solids by weight) and some amount of<br>
pregnant liquor. The overlying supernatant is the liquor that is separated for secondary<br>
clarification, again as discussed above. The interface between the supernatant mud<br>
liquor and the mud layer is clearly seen in some cases, but the supernatant is not<br>
entirely free of suspended solids, appearing instead as a translucent liquid. The present<br>
invention diminishes the amount of suspended solids in such supernatant, and hence<br>
decreases the extent of secondary clarification required to obtain a given purity of<br>
sodium aluminate solution. Use of the polymers of this invention also reduces or<br>
eliminates the need for starch by improved supernatant liquor clarity and improved red<br>
mud stability, and the rheological properties of the concentrated red mud shiny.<br>
The digested slurry is typically discharged from the flash tanks at elevated<br>
temperatures. The primary settler feed is generally not further cooled before charging<br>
to the primary settlement stage other than the cooling which may occur when a<br>
digested slurry is optionally admixed with the liquor from the first red mud wash stage<br>
to form a primary settler feed. The flocculation of the primary settler feed is<br>
conducted at atmospheric pressures and at elevated temperatures of from about 80 °C<br>
to about 110 °C. The flocculation of the primary settled feed can also be conducted at<br>
elevated pressures and temperatures as high as 200 °C.<br>
The following applies to any aspect of this invention. High and/or lower<br>
molecular weight salicylic acid containing polymers may be used in combination with<br>
any conventional nonionic polysaccharide flocculant such as starch, dextran, alginate<br>
and flour, and anionic flocculants such as homopolymers of acrylic acid or acrylates,<br>
co-ploymers of acrylic acid or acrylates containing at least 50 molar percent acrylic<br>
acid or acrylate monomers, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts of<br>
said acids, or a polyacrylate alkyl ester of acrylate copolymer with 60 to about 90<br>
percent of the alkyl ester groups hydrolyzed. Any of the above anionic flocculants<br>
may be further functionalized with pendant hydroxamic acid groups. The salicylic<br>
acid containing polymer may be added before, after or simultaneously with any of the<br>
foregoing.<br><br>
The polymers may also be utilized to treat the last stage washer underflow at<br>
the mud disposal site to improve mud stacking, or more rapid release of liquor from<br>
the mud. Moreover, the polymers may also be utilized for the treatment of mud filters,<br>
including but not limited to drum and vacuum filters.<br>
Water soluble polymers of this invention are used as follows: A solution of the<br>
polymer is prepared in an appropriate dilution water stream typically as an about 0.1 to<br>
about 1 weight percent polymer active solution. This solution is added to the digested<br>
bauxite sodium aluminate process stream containing suspended solids in an amount<br>
sufficient to settle said solids. For example, the polymer is injected into the feed-line<br>
upstream of the settling vessel and/or added to the center-well of the settling vessel.<br>
Alternatively, water-continuous polymers of this invention are added neat or as<br>
a dilute solution to the primary liquor feed of a Bayer process. The water continuous<br>
polymers hydrolyze in situ in the Bayer process liquor itself. In more detail, co-<br>
polymers and or terpolymers formed from acrylic acid and/or acrylic acid esters and<br>
salicylic esters may not be active as red mud flocculants until the ester groups are<br>
hydrolyzed. When placed in the Bayer process liquor in the presence of red mud, the<br>
high alkalinity and the high temperatures convert the polymers to effective red mud<br>
flocculants by hydrolyzing the various ester groups to ionized acrylic acid and salicylic<br>
acid groups. Furthermore, the polymer does not hydrolyze instantly, but rather over<br>
time. Therefore, the poly (acrylic acid/acrylic acid ester/salicylic acid ester) essentially<br>
is being activated continuously.<br>
The salicylic acid containing polymers are injected upstream from the primary<br>
settler, such as in one of the flash tanks or between the flash tanks and the primary<br>
settler feed well where there is sufficient temperature and residence time to allow the<br>
hydrolysis of the polymer. The hydrolysis will progress as the polymer and mud make<br>
their way from the flash tanks down the various piping and into the primary settler.<br>
The red mud containing liquor may be a primary settler feed, a mud washer<br>
feed, a centrifuge feed or the polishing filter feed (pressure or sand filter). The feed<br>
may be from a digester blow-off, diluted digester blow-off, primary settler underflow,<br>
washer underflow, or a combination of settler and washer underflows with other<br>
process streams including but not limited to settler overflow, washer overflows, lake<br><br>
return water or raw water. The polymers described herein, when utilized to treat Bayer<br>
process red-mud containing liquor, result in an increase in both clarity and settling rate.<br>
The water-continuous polymers of this invention may be hydrolyzed in a<br>
caustic solution, using various plant liquor streams alone or combinations thereof such<br>
as spent liquor, pregnant liquor, any washing circuit overflow liquor containing some<br>
caustic, lake return water, and/or condensate waters with addition of caustic, prior to<br>
being added to the primary liquor feed of a Bayer process as details above.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the polymer is hydrolyzed prior to addition to the<br>
Bayer process liquor.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the Bayer process liquor is selected from settler<br>
feed, settler overflow, digestion blow-off, mud washer in the washer train, feed to the<br>
primary polishing filters, feed to a mud settler, feed to the primary alumina<br>
crystallization tanks, feed to the secondary and tertiary alumina classifers or trays, feed<br>
to hydrate filters or feed to a centrifuge.<br>
In another preferred aspect, one or more anionic or nonionic flocculan(s) are<br>
added to the liquor.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the nonionic flocculant is starch, dextran or flour.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic flocculant comprises poly (meth)acrylic<br>
acid.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the poly (meth)acrylic acid is selected from the<br>
group consisting of poly(meth)acrylic acid, poly(meth)acrylic acid containing pendant<br>
hydroxamic acid groups,<br>
poly (alkyl (meth)acrylate), (meth)acrylic acid/alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymers,<br>
(meth)acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymers, (tneth)acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymers<br>
containing pendant hydroxamic acid groups, (meth)acrylic acid/acryiamide/alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate terpolymers, and<br>
(methjacrylic acid/acrylamide/AMPS terpolymers.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic flocculant is added prior to the salicylic<br>
acid containing polymer.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic flocculant is added after the salicylic<br>
acid containing polymer.<br><br>
In another preferred aspect, the anionic flocculant is added together with the<br>
salicylic acid containing polymer.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the potyomer comprising pendant salicylic acid<br>
groups has an RSV of at least about 14 dL/g and the anionic flocculant has an RSV of<br>
at least about 21 dL/g.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following<br>
examples, which are presented for illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>

Preparation of 4-methacrylamidosalicylic acid (4-MASA).<br>
In a 5 L flask, 250 g of 4-aminosalicylic acid (Aldrich Chemical Co.,<br>
Milwaukee, WI) is dissolved in 2.0 L of acetone under a nitrogen atmosphere with the<br>
aid of mechanical stirring. To this is added, at room temperature, 375 g of methacrylic<br>
anhydride (Aldrich) dropwisc over 1 hour. After stirring for 16 hours, the volume of<br>
acetone is reduced to 1.0 L by vacuum distillation. The crude solid product which<br>
precipitates from solution is collected by vacuum filtration. The product is washed<br>
with 500 mL of 5:1 water methanol and purified further by stirring the solid for 30<br>

Example 5<br>
Preparation of a 3 mole percent 4-mcthacrylamidosalicylic acid (4-MASA) / 97 mole<br>
percent sodium acrylate inverse emulsion copolymer by batch polymerization.<br>
A 500 mL reaction flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser,<br>
dropping funnel, gas inlet tube and a thermometer is charged with 33 g of acrylic acid<br>
and 45 g of deionized water. This solution is neutralized with sodium hydroxide (50%<br>
aqueous solution), such that the final pH is about 8.5. The neutralization is conducted<br>
in an ice bath and care is taken to ensure that the temperature of the monomer solution<br>
does not exceed 25 °C. To the resulting neutralized solution is added 0.013 g of<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tetrasodium salt (EDTA, Aldrich). Separately, 3.67 g<br>
of 4-MASA is dissolved in 10.0 g of deionized water by adjusting the pH of this<br><br>
solution to about 12.5 with sodium hydroxide (50 % aqueous solution). The two<br>
monomer solutions are combined and the pH of the resulting mixture is adjusted to<br>
about 10.5 with sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid, as required.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating a mixture of 45.2 g of a paraffinic solvent<br>
(Escaid® 110, Exxon, Houston, TX), 3.15 g of a sorbitan monooleate (Span® 80, ICI<br>
Americas, Wilmington, DE), 1.37 g of a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostereate<br>
(Tween® 61, ICI), 0.94 g of a polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate (Tween® 65, ICI),<br>
and 2.89 g of oleic acid (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) until the surfactants are<br>
dissolved (54-57 °C). The oil phase is transferred into the reactor described above and<br>
heated to 45 °C.<br>
With stirring at 1000 rpm, the aqueous monomer phase is added over two<br>
minutes. The resulting water-in-oil emulsion is stirred for thirty minutes while it is<br>
purged with nitrogen. After this time, 0.0525 g of Vazo® 64 and 0.0075 g of Vazo® 52<br>
is added to the water-in-oil emulsion. The polymerization is carried out under a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at 45 °C for 4 hours, then at 55 °C for one hour. The finished<br>
emulsion product is then cooled to 25 °C. The polymer has a reduced specific<br>
viscosity of 18.8 dL/g (measured as a 400 ppm solution in 2N sodium nitrate solution<br>
at 30 °C) and a Brookfield viscosity of 1050 cps (#3 spindle at 12 rpm).<br>
Example 6<br>
Semi-batch polymerization to produce a 6 mole percent 4-methacrylamidosalicylic<br>
acid (4-MASA) / 94 mole percent sodium acrylate inverse emulsion copolymer.<br>
The reaction apparatus employed in this example is the same as that described<br>
in Example 4. Acrylic acid, 33 g and 0.013 g of EDTA is dissolved in 30 g of<br>
deionized water and neutralized with sodium hydroxide (50% aqueous solution) such<br>
that the final pH of the solution is about 8.5. The neutralization is conducted in an ice<br>
bath and care is taken to ensure that the temperature ot the monomer solution does not<br>
exceed 25 °C.<br>
Separately, 6.65 g of 4-MASA is dissolved in 10.0 g of deionized water by<br>
adjusting the pH of the water to about 12.5 with sodium hydroxide (50% aqueous<br>
solution), and this solution is set aside.<br><br>
An oil phase is prepared by beating (54-57 °C) 3.15 g of Span® 80,1.37 g<br>
Tween® 61,0.94 g of Tween® 65, and 2.89 g of oleic acid in 45.20 g of Escaid® 110<br>
until the surfactants are dissolved.<br>
The oil phase is charged to the reactor and the contents of the reactor are stirred at<br>
1000 rpm. The aqueous monomer phase is then added to the reactor over two minutes<br>
so that a water-in-oil emulsion is formed. The emulsion is purged with nitrogen and<br>
heated to 45 °C. Polymerization is initiated by adding 0.0525 g of Vazo#64 aad<br>
0.0075 g of Vazo ® 52. After sixty minutes, the solution of 4-methacrylamidosalicylic<br>
acid is fed to the reactor over a few minutes. The polymerization is continued for<br>
another two hours at 45 °C, and then for one hour at 55 °C. After this time, the<br>
emulsion is cooled to room temperature. The polymer has a reduced specific viscosity<br>
of 17.4 dlVg (measured as a 400 ppm solution in 2N sodium nitrate solution at 30 ºC)<br>
and a Brookfield viscosity of 3260 cps (#3 spindle at 12 rpm).<br>

methacrylamidosalicylic acid (4-MASA) / 94 mole percent sodium acrylate inverse<br>
emulsion copolymer.<br>
The reaction apparatus employed in this example is the same as that described<br>
in Example 4. Acrylic acid (33 g) and 0.013 g of EDTA is dissolved in 30 g of<br>

that the final pH of the solution is about 8.5. The neutralization is conducted in an ice<br>
bath and care is taken to ensure that the temperature of the monomer solution does not<br>
exceed 25 °C.<br>
Separately, 6.65 g of 4-MASA is dissolved in 10.0 g of deionized water by<br>
adjusting the pH of the water to about 12.5 with sodium hydroxide (50% aqueous<br>
solution), and this solution is set aside.<br>
An oil phase is prepared by heating (54-57 °C) 3.15 g of Span® 80, 1 -37 g<br>
Tween® 61, 0.94 g of Tween® 65, and 2.89 g of oleic acid in 45.20 g of Escaid® 110<br>
until the surfactants are dissolved.<br><br>
The oil phase is charged to the reactor and the contents of the reactor are stirred at<br>
1000 rpm. The aqueous monomer phase is then added to the reactor over two minutes<br>
so that a water-in-oil emulsion is formed. The emulsion is purged with nitrogen and<br>
heated to 45 °C. Polymerization is initiated by adding 0.0525 g of Vazo ® 64 and<br>
0.0075 g of Vazo® 52. After fifteen minutes, the solution of 4-MASA is fed to the<br>
reactor over sixty minutes. The polymerization is continued for a total of three hours<br>
at 45 °C, and then for one hour at 55 °C. After this time, the emulsion is cooled to<br>
room temperature. The polymer has a reduced specific viscosity of 31.0 dL/g<br>
(measured as a 400 ppm solution in 2N sodium nitrate solution at 30 °C) and a<br>
Brookfield viscosity of 4300 cps (#3 spindle at 12 rpm).<br>

Tween® 61, 0.94 g of Tween® 65, and 2.89 g of oleic acid in 45.20 g Escaid® 110 until<br>
the surfactants are dissolved.<br>
The oil phase is charged to the reactor and the contents of the reactor are stirred<br>
at 1000 rpm. The aqueous monomer phase is then added to the reactor over two<br>
minutes so that a water in oil emulsion is formed. The emulsion is purged with<br>
nitrogen and heated to 45 °C. Polymerization is initiated by adding 0.0525 g of Vazo®<br><br>
64 and 0.0075 g of Vazo®52. After fifteen minutes, the solution of 4-MASA is fed to<br>
the reactor over the course of sixty minutes. The polymerization is continued for a<br>
total of three hours at 45 °C, and then for one hour at 55 °C. After this time, the<br>
emulsion is cooled to room temperature and transferred to storage. The polymer has a<br>

Representative high molecular weight inverse emulsion polymers prepared<br>
according to the method of Examples 13 and 14 are listed in Table 3. In Table 3, Na or<br>
(NH4) AA = sodium or ammonium acrylate, 4-MASA = 4-methacrylamidosalicylic<br>

Example 15<br>
Hydrolysis of 96/1/3 poly(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid/4-methacrylamidosalicylic acid)<br>
emulsion polymer.<br>
Activity tests reported herein are performed using the poly (sodium<br>
acrylate/sodium<br><br>
4-methacrylamidosalicylic acid) resulting from hydrolysis of the polymers prepared<br>
above and shown in Table 2. Hydrolysis is effected using 1% of the emulsion in 1%<br>
NaOH at 85°C for 20 minutes.<br>
The rate at which the poly(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid/4-<br>
methacrylamidosalicylic acid) polymers are hydrolyzed can be controlled by the<br>
caustic soda concentration and by the reaction temperature. As hydrolysis occurs, the<br>
polymers become more water soluble. For example, the percent hydrolysis of Polymer<br>
2 at 1% of the emulsion in 1% NaOH at 85°C for 15, 30,45 60 90 and 120 minutes is<br>
measured and summarized in Table 4. Colloid titration is used to determine the<br>
anionic charge and the degree of hydrolysis.<br><br>

Settling and Clarity Performance of Representative Salicylic Acid Containing<br>
Flocculants versus Conventional Polymer Treatments<br>
The settling and clarity performance of representative salicylic acid containing<br>
polymers of this invention is compared to conventional polymer treatments. The<br>
results are summarized in Tables 5-24. The data summarized in Tables 5-24 are<br>
obtained as described below.<br>
The following general test procedure is utilized to obtain settling rate<br>
information. A well mixed sample of settler feed slurry (red mud obtained from a<br>
mineral processing facility) is portioned out into eighteen to twenty 1000-mL<br>
Nalgene® graduated cylinders by filling all the cylinders to the 500-mL graduation.<br>
The remaining 500-mL is then added to the cylinders in the opposite order. These<br><br>
cylinders are immediately placed in a clear-sided glass or plastic hot water bath<br>
maintained to 98-100°C. An alternative method involved performing the tests on a<br>
smaller scale using 0.1 or 0.25 L cylinders.<br>
Cylinders containing the feed slurry are allowed to equilibrate to the bath<br>
temperature over a 20-30 min period.<br>
While remaining in the water bath, the cylinder is immediately mixed by two<br>
plunges. The plunger is a 1/8" metal rod with a #10 rubber stopper attached to the<br>
bottom end. The plunger is allowed to fall freely on the downward stroke aad lifted at<br>
the same speed on the upward stroke. To test a polymer, that polymer is added to the<br>
1000 mL graduated cylinder and mixed with a constant number of plunges (typically<br>
four or six).<br>
To determine settling rate, the time for the solid/liquid interface to travel<br>
between the 900 and 700 mL marks on the cylinder is recorded. After measuring the<br>
distance between the two marks, the settling rate can be calculated in (ft/hr) or (m/hr)<br>
units.<br>
Based on this information, a replacement ratio (RR) may be calculated by<br>
plotting a graph with settling rate on the Y-axis and dose on the X-axis for each<br>
product tested. The dosage required to produce the desired plant settling rate is<br>
determined from the above graph. The replacement ratio is the dose of new polymer<br>
divided by the dose of conventional treatment needed to obtain the plant settling rate.<br>
If the RR value is below one, the experimental polymer is superior, if it is one, it is<br>
equivalent, and if it is above one it is poorer in activity relative to the conventional<br>
treatment polymer.<br>
For all settling test, the Conventional Treatment Polymer A (CTP A. a co-<br>
polymer of methyl acrylate/acrylic acid, available from Nalco Chemical Company.<br>
Naperville, IL) is hydrolyzed as 1% emulsion in a 10 g/L NaOH solution at 80-85 C<br>
for the optimum period of time (typically, 20-30 min) then diluted in de-ionized water<br>
to 0.1-0.2 weight percent (based on emulsion). Representative emulsion pohymers 1-4<br>
are hydrolyzed at 80-85°C in a 10 g/L NaOH solution at 1.0-1.5 % for 30 minutes then<br>
further diluted, with de-ionized water to 0.2 weight percent (based on emulsion). The<br>
Conventional Treatment Polymer B (CTP B, poly(ammonium acrylate), available from<br>
Nalco Chemical Company, Naperville, IL) is inverted as a 1% emulsion in a 10 gL<br><br>
NaOH solution, then diluted, with de-ionized water to 0.05-0.1 weight percent (based<br>
on emulsion). Representative inverse emulsion polymers 5-18 are inverted as a 1.0 or<br>
a 2.0 % emulsion in a 10 g/L NaOH solution, then diluted, with de-ionized water to<br>
0.1-0.2 weight percent (based on emulsion).<br>
The clarity of the settler overflow is determined in a sample of the liquor taken<br>
from the top of the 1000 mL graduated cylinder after a specific time after settling,<br>
(e.g., typically 10 min, or 30 min). The overflow solids may be determined<br>
gravimetrically by filtering a specific volume of liquor, washing the solids with hot<br>
water and drying the solids in an oven at 100 °C for 2-4 hours. Alternatively, the<br>
turbidity of the overflow liquor is considered to be an indirect measure of the overflow<br>
solids. The turbidity (as NTU) is determined using a Hach Co. turbidimeter. If the<br>
turbidity of the overflow sample is over the range of the meter, then all the samples<br>
may be diluted to a specific volume using a hot 30 wt. % NaOH solution (e.g., 5 mL of<br>
overflow combined with 10 mL of 30 wt % NaOH solution).<br>
A clarity ratio is evaluated as a measure of the performance of the new polymer<br>
compared to conventional polymers. This is determined as the ratio of the overflow<br>
turbidity (or residual solids) using the new polymer divided by the turbidity (or<br>
residual solids) of the overflow for the conventional fJocculant at the same specific<br>
settling rate (i.e., the plant settling rate).<br>
Laboratory settling tests are performed at 95-100 °C on a variety of red mud<br>
slurries using the standard method described above. An aliquot (100 mL) of liquor is<br>
removed via syringe from the top of the cylinder after a specific time after settling,<br>
(e.g., typically 10 min, or 30 min). The filtration rate of this aliquot through a pre-<br>
weighed filter paper is measured in seconds. A vacuum pump with a control gauge is<br>
used to maintain a constant vacuum for/during all tests. The timer is started<br>
immediately upon pouring the liquor on the filter paper, and then stopped at the first<br>
sign of dry surfaces on the filter. The overflow clarity of the aliquot is also determined<br>
gravimetrically (mg/L) after washing and drying the filter paper. To assess clarity and<br>
filtration times appropriate doses of each floccuiant are used such that approximately<br>
the same settling rates for all cylinders is obtained.<br>
Filtration times can be effectively compared for different polymers which<br>
produce approximately the same settling rate. A shorter filtration time value mease,<br><br>
that the flocculant is aiding filtration more efficiently. Residual flocculant (both<br>
synthetic and natural red mud flocculants) in the supernatant liquor have been shown<br>
to severely reduce filtration rate in the secondary clarification stage.<br>
A filtration ratio is determined by dividing the filtration time of the<br>
experimental polymer by the filtration time of the CTP.<br>
Tests are performed on a variety of red mud slurries using different Jamaican<br>
bauxite ores. The results of the foregoing tests for representative polymers of this<br>
invention are shown in Tables 5-24, below.<br>
In Tables 5-24, Mud Slurries A-K are red mud slurries prepared from the low<br>
temperature digestion of a Jamaican bauxite having the following total soda and solids<br>
content.<br>
Mud Slurry A: total soda = 245 g/L as Na2CO3 and 45.7 g/L solids;<br>
Mud Slurry B: total soda = 270 g/L as Na2CO3 and 56.8 g/L solids;<br>

As shown in Table 5, representative salicylic acid containing emulsion<br>
polymers give comparable settling rates to those of the conventional treatment, as<br>
evidenced by a replacement ratio of about 1.6 to 2.4 (based on polymer actives).<br><br>
The relative performance of the polymers of this invention compared to CTP A<br>
is shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6<br>
Average Settling, Clarity and Filtration Performance of Representative Salicylic Acid<br>
Containing Flocculants versus Conventional Treatment Polymer A (CTP A)<br><br>
As shown in Table 6, the polymers of this invention afford a 25 - 55 %<br>
improvement in the overflow clarity as evidenced by clarity ratios of about 0.75 to<br>
0.45 respectively. The polymers also improve the fiiterability of the overflow liquor<br>
by about 10 to 35%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Tables 7-11, representative salicylic acid containing polymers<br>
give good settling rate results relative to a conventional treatment, as evidenced by<br>
replacement ratios (based on polymer actives) generally of about 1.6 to 5. In some<br>
cases, the replacement ratio is higher than 4, for example from about 5 to 9. This can<br>
be explained in part by the significantly lower RSV for the new polymer relative to the<br>
conventional treatment polymer. In general, the replacement ratios for the inverse<br>
emulsion polymers of this invention are higher than those of the emulsion polymers of<br>
this invention, because on average they have lower polymer RSV.<br>
The new inverse emulsion polymers afford significant improvements from<br>
about 10 to 75 % in the overflow clarity relative to the conventional treatments as<br>
evidenced by clarity ratios of about 0.75 to 0.25, respectively. The improvement in<br>
overflow clarity is affected by the mole ratio of salicylic acid goups present in the<br>
polymer, for example compare the results in Table 9, above. Increasing the amount of<br>
salicylic acid groups in the copolymer increased the clarification performance of the<br>
resulting polymer relative to the poly(acrylic acid) homopolymer.<br><br>
The polymers of this invention also improve the filterability of the overflow<br>
liquor by about 10 to 35 %. Filterability data for a representative polymer is shown in<br>
Table 12.<br>
Table 12<br>
Filterability Data for a Representative Salicylic Acid Containing Polymer Flocculant<br>
versus Conventional Treatment Polymer B<br><br>
Statistical analysis of the foregoing data shows (at a 95 % confidence level): a<br>
38% decrease in the overflow turbidity; a 42% decrease in overflow solids; and a 6%<br>
faster filtration time for polymer 14 vs. CTP B.<br>
Settling and clarity performance of representative polymers of this invention in<br>
combination with conventional treatment polymers is shown in Tables 13 - 15.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Tables 13 and 14, when a salicylic acid containing polymer with<br>
RSV of 14-21 dL/g is applied first to the mud slurry followed by the addition of a<br>
small amount of a high molecular weight poly(methyl acrylate/acrylic acid) or<br>
poly(ammonium acrylate) polymer having a RSV of &gt; 31-49 dL/g, overflow clarities<br>
can be improved by 40 to 70% over the conventional treatment alone. Furthermore,<br><br>
adding the low molecular weight polymer before the high molecular weight polymer is<br>
more effective at reducing the amount of residual overflow solids during clarification<br>
of the feed solids than multiple additions of a pre-blended mixture of the two<br>
polymers.<br>
Table 15<br>
Average Settling, Clarity, and Filtration Rate Performance of Representative Salicylic<br>
Acid Containing Polymers versus Conventional Treatment Polymer A<br><br>
As shown in Table 15, improved clarity is also obtained using combinations of<br>
the low and high molecular weight polymers containing pendant salicylic acid groups.<br>
Tests with addition of only the low molecular weight polymers of this invention (i.e.,<br>
RSV 
ft/hr.<br>
Table 14 further shows that upon comparison to conventional treatment<br>
Polymer B, the polymers of this invention improve filtration rates on average. Better<br>
clarity, lower NTU or lower suspended solids are preferred as the resulting liquor will<br>
effectively allow a refinery to filter a larger amount of liquor before regenerating the<br>
filter aid.<br>
As a note, in the absence of any polymer treatment, mud settling rates would be<br>
less than 1 ft/hr and clarity would be &gt;4000 NTU for reference to Tables 3 to 13.<br>
The polymers of this invention, alone and in combination with starch and/or<br>
dextran effectively clarify Bayer process red mud thickener feed. The data is shown in<br><br>
Table 16. The data shows a marked reduction in residual overflow solids and<br>
improved filtration rate relative to a conventional polymer treatment.<br>
Table 16<br>
Settling and Clarity Performance of Representative Salicylic Acid Containing<br>
Polymers versus Conventional Treatment Polymer B on Bayer Process Red Mud<br>
Thickener Feed<br><br>
The polymers of this invention are also effective in removing precipitated<br>
alumina (bright hydrate) solids from Bayer process liquors. The data for a<br>
representative poly(sodium acrylate /sodium 4-methacrylamidosalicylic acid)polymer<br>
of this invention is shown in Tables 17 and 18. In Tables 17 and 18, CTP C is dextran.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 17, the polymers of this invention provide about 40-55<br>
percent lower overflow solids in the liquor compared to the conventional treatment<br>
program.<br>
Table 18<br>
Settling and Clarity Performance of Representative Salicylic Acid Containing<br>
Polymers versus Conventional Treatment Polymer C in Bayer Process Secondary<br>
Hydrate Thickeners<br><br>
As shown in Table 18, the polymers of this invention provide overflow clarities<br>
similar to the conventional treatment program and significantly improved underflow<br>
densities.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Tables 19-22, representative salicylic acid containing terpolymers<br>
demonstrate good settling rate results relative to conventional treatment at NaAMPS<br>
levels less than or equal to 15 %. At NaAMPS levels above 15 % settling rates<br>
decrease markedly, however clarity ratios exhibit a 40 % increase. The new polymers<br>
afford a slightly better than 50 % increase in solution clarities as evidenced by the<br>
clarity ratios. Again clarity performance is influenced by the amount of salicylic acid<br>
incorporated into the polymer. For example compare the results of polymer 21 and 22.<br><br><br>
As shown in Tables 23 and 24, representative salicylic acid containing<br>
polymers incorporating acrylamide gave good settling rate results relative to<br>
conventional treatment, as evidenced by replacement ratios (based on polymer actives)<br>
generally 2.9 to 5.<br><br>
The new inverse emulsion polymers afford significant improvements in the<br>
overflow clarity of about 5 to 60 % relative to the conventional treatment as evidenced<br>
by clarity ratios of 0.96 to 0.38, respectively. The improvement in overflow clarity is<br>
affected by the mole ratio of salicylic acid groups m the polymer, for example compare<br>
polymers 26 and 27 in Table 24 above. Increasing the amount of salicylic acid in the<br>
copolymer increases the clarification performance of the resulting polymer relative to<br>
conventional treatment polymer B.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 25, the salicylic acid containing flocculants of this invention<br>
can be used alone or in combination with a traditional acrylate and or<br>
acrylate/acrylamide polymer without the need for starch.<br>
It is understood that mixtures of polymers of this invention, or mixtures of one<br>
or more polymers of this invention with conventional treatment polymer(s) (for<br>
example, polysaccharides, acrylate homopolymers, copolymers and or terpolymers<br>
with acrylamide, hydroxamic acid groups, AMPS, etc ) or reagents are contemplated as<br>
falling within the scope of this invention.<br>
