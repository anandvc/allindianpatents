HETEROCYCLYL NICOTINAMIDES AND SIMILAR PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES AS PESTICIDES<br>
Description<br>
Heterocyclic amides, a process for their preparation, compositions comprising them and their use<br>
The invention relates to heterocyclic amides, to processes for their preparation, to compositions comprising them and to their use for controlling animal pests, in particular arthropods, such as insects and acarids, and helminths.<br>
Owing to the enormous damage caused by insects, for example by feeding on useful plants, stored food, wood and textiles, or else by transferring diseases to man, domestic animals and useful plants, the use of insecticides or repellents is still indispensable. Insecticides are an important component of integrated pest control, and their contribution is decisive with respect to harvest yield and harvest continuity all over the world.<br>
EP-A 0 580 374 discloses trifluoromethylpyridinamides for use as pesticides.<br>
However, since the ecological and economical demands made on modern insecticides are increasing constantly, for example with respect to toxicity, selectivity, application rate, formation of residues and favorable manufacture, and there can furthermore be problems, for example, with resistance, there is a constant need to develop novel insecticides which, at least in some areas, have advantages over those of the prior art.<br>
It has been found that compounds of the formula (I), if appropriate also as salts, have a good activity spectrum against animal pests and at the same time good plant tolerance and favorable toxicological properties with respect to mammals and aquatic animals.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides amides of the formula (I) and salts thereof<br><br>

Depending on the nature of the substituents defined above, the compounds of the formula (I) have acidic or basic properties and are capable of forming salts. If, for example, the compounds of the formula (I) carry groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl or other groups which induce acidic properties, these compounds can be reacted with bases to form salts. Suitable bases are, for example, hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, in particular those of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, furthermore ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines with (C1-4)-alkyl radicals and mono-, di- and trialkanolamines of (C1-4)-alkanols. If, for example, the compounds of the formula (I) carry groups such as amino, alkylamino or other groups which induce basic properties, these compounds can be reacted with acids to form salts. Suitable acids are, for example, mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, organic acids, such as acetic acid or oxalic acid, and acidic salts, such as NaHSCU and KHSO4. The salts obtainable in this manner likewise have insecticidal, acaricidal and miticidal properties.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or stereoisomers on double bonds. Therefore, it is possible for enantiomers or diastereomers to be present. The invention embraces both the pure isomers and their mixtures. The mixtures of diastereomers can be separated into the isomers by customary methods, for example by selective crystallization from suitable solvents or by chromatography. Racemates can be separated into the enantiomers by customary methods.<br>
The preparation of the compounds according to the invention is carried out by methods known per se from the literature, as described in standard works on organic synthesis (cf., for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
The preparation is carried out under reaction conditions which are known and are suitable for the reactions mentioned. It is also possible to use variants which are known per se but not mentioned here in detail.<br><br>
If desired, the starting materials can also be formed in situ, i.e. they are not isolated from the reaction mixture but immediately reacted further to give the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention also relates to processes for preparing compounds of the formula (I).<br>
To prepare compounds of the formula (I), for example, in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, A, Y and n have the meanings given for formula (I), a carboxylic acid of the formula<br>
(I").<br><br>
in which X, R1, R2, R3 and n have the meanings given above for formula (I) is in the form of an activated derivative of this acid, for example an acid halide, ester or anhydride, reacted in the presence of a base, preferably at least one amine, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine or lutidine, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate or alkali metal hydroxide, or of combinations of these compounds, with a compound of the formula (IV), in which R4 and R5 have the meanings given above for formula (I)<br>
HNR4R5        (IV), and the radical R5 is subsequently, if appropriate, derivatized further.<br>
Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the abovementioned scheme may also be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner. In this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual<br><br>
Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A series of commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleiftheim, Germany or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, England, may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols which are known from the literature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products by IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are<br><br>
employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>
The preparation of the processes described herein yields compounds of the formula (I) in the form of substance collections which are termed libraries.<br>
The present invention also relates to libraries which comprise at least two compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids, helminths and mollusks, very especially preferably for controlling insects and arachnids which are encountered in agriculture, in livestock breeding, in forests, in the protection of stored goods and materials, and in the hygiene sector, and have good plant tolerance and favorable toxicity to warmblooded species.

The invention also relates to compositions, for example crop protection compositions, preferably insecticidal, acaricidal, ixodicidal, nematicidal, molluscicidal or fungicidal, especially preferably insecticidal and acaricidal, compositions which comprise one or more compounds of the formula (I) in addition to suitable formulation auxiliaries.<br>
To prepare the compositions according to the invention, the active substance and the other additives are combined and brought into a suitable use form.<br>
The invention also relates to compositions, in particular insecticidal and acaricidal compositions, which comprise the compounds of the formula (I) in addition to suitable formulation auxiliaries.<br>
In general, the compositions according to the invention comprise 1 to 95% by weight of the active substances of the formula (I). They can be formulated in various ways, depending on the biological and/or chemical-physical parameters which prevail. The following are examples of possible formulations:<br>
Wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), dusts (DP), seed-dressing products, granules in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes or baits.<br>
These individual types of formulations are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hanser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986; van Falkenberg, "Pesticides<br><br>
Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd Ed. 1972-73; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries i.e. carrier materials and/or surface active substances such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are also known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H. v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheon's, "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte", [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts] Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1967; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie", Volume 7, C. Hanser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other pesticidally active materials, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready-mix formulation or a tank mix. Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water which, besides the active substance, also comprise wetters, for example polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, alkylsulfonates or alkylphenolsulfonates and dispersants, for example sodium lignosulfonate or sodium 2,2'- dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, in addition to a diluent or inert material.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active substance in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with addition of one or more emulsifiers. As emulsifiers, the following can be used, for example: calcium alkylarylsulfonates such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl<br><br>
polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained, for example, by grinding the active substance with finely divided solid materials, for example talc or natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophyllite or diatomaceous earth. Granules can be prepared either by atomizing the active substance onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates onto the surface of carrier materials such as sand or kaolinites, or of granulated inert material, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol or sodium polyacrylate, or else mineral oils. Suitable active substances can also be granulated in the manner which is customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
The active substance concentration in wettable powders is, for example, approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight is composed of customary formulation auxiliaries. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active substance concentration may be approximately 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts usually comprise 5 to 20% by weight of active substance, sprayable solutions approximately 2 to 20% by weight. In the case of granules, the active substance content depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries, fillers and the like are being used.<br>
In addition, the abovementioned active substance formulations comprise, if appropriate, the tackifiers, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, solvents, fillers or carriers which are conventional in each case.<br>
For use, the concentrates, which are present in commercially available form, are, if desired, diluted in the customary manner, for example in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and in some cases also microgranules, using water. Preparations in the form of dusts and granules and<br>
&gt;<br><br>
sprayable solutions are usually not diluted any further with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The application rate required varies with the external conditions such as, inter alia, temperature and humidity. It may vary within wide limits, for example between 0.0005 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.001 and 5 kg/ha of active compound.<br>
The active substances according to the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations may be present in mixtures with other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>
The pesticides include, for example, phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxylic esters, formamidines, tin compounds and materials produced by microorganisms.<br>

The active substance content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations may range from 0.00000001 up to 95% by weight of active substance, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight.<br>
Application is effected in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof for controlling harmful organisms.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for controlling harmful insects, arachrids and/or nematodes, which comprises applying an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I) or salts thereof to the pests or the site of the desired effect.<br>
The active substances according to the invention are also suitable for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the human and veterinary medicine sector and/or in the field of animal keeping. The active substances according to the invention are applied in the known manner, such as by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks or granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides the use of a compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof for preparing a pharmaceutical for use in humans and/or animals, preferably a veterinary pharmaceutical, especially for the control of ecto- and/or endoparasites.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention can also be employed particularly advantageously for treating warm-blooded animals, in particular in livestock keeping (for example cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry such as chickens, geese and the like). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds, if appropriate in suitable formulations, are administered orally to the .<br><br>
animals, if appropriate together with the drinking water or feed. Since excretion in the feces is efficient, the development of insects in the animals' feces can be prevented very easily in this manner. The dosages and formulations which are suitable in each case depend, in particular, on the species and the developmental stage of the productive livestock and also on the risk of infestation and can be determined readily and established by customary methods. For example, the compounds can be employed in cattle at dosages of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg bodyweight.<br>
In addition to their lethal effect on pests, the compounds of the formula (I) also have a pronounced repellent effect.<br>
A repellent for the purpose of the invention is a substance or substance mixture which has a warding-off or fending-off effect on other life organisms, in particular harmful pests and nuisance pests. The term also encompasses effects such as the antifeeding effect, where the intake of feed is disturbed or prevented (antifeedant effect), supression of oviposition, or an effect on the development of the population.<br>
The invention therefore also provides the use of compounds of the formula (I) or their salts for achieving the abovementioned effects, in particular in the case of the pests stated in the biological examples.<br>
The invention also provides a method for fending off, or warding off, harmful organisms, where one or more compounds of the formula (I) or their salts are applied to the site from which the harmful organisms are to be fended off or warded off.<br>
In the case of a plant, application may mean, for example, a treatment of the plant, or also of the seed.<br>
As regards the effect on populations, it is interesting to note that effects can also be observed in succession during the development of a population, where summation may take place. In such a case, the individual effect itself may only have an efficacy<br><br>
of markedly less than 100% but in total an efficacy of 100% is still achieved in the end.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the formula (I) or their salts are distinguished by the fact that the composition is usually applied earlier than in the case of a direct control, if the abovementioned effects are to be exploited. The effect frequently lasts over a long period, so that a duration of action of over 2 months is achieved.<br>
The effects are observed in insects, arachnids and others of the abovementioned pests.<br>
In addition to the abovementioned application methods, the active compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have excellent systemic action. Accordingly, the active compounds can also be introduced into the plants via parts of the plant, both below ground and above ground (for example root, stem, leaf), if the active compounds are applied, in liquid or solid form, onto the plant and/or in the direct vicinity of the plant (for example granules in soil application, application in flooded rice paddies).<br>
Furthermore, the active compounds according to the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of vegetative and generative plant propagation material, such as, for example, of seeds, for example of cereals, vegetables, cotton, rice, sugar beet and other crops and ornamental plants, of bulbs, seedlings and tubers of other crops and ornamental plants which are propagated vegetatively. The treatment can be carried out before sowing or before planting (for example by special seed coating techniques, by dressing in liquid or solid form or as a seed box treatment), during sowing or planting or after sowing or planting by special application techniques (for example furrow treatment). The amount of active compound used can vary within a relatively large range, depending on the application. In general, the application rates are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known genetically engineered plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful organisms to be observed in other crops, which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened spectrum of pests which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore provides the use of compounds of the formula (I) for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention embraces, in addition to direct application onto the pests, any other application in which compounds of the formula (I) act on the pests. Such indirect applications can, for example, be the use of compounds which, for example in the soil, the plant or the pest, decompose into compounds of the formula (I) or are degraded into compounds of the formula (I).,<br><br>

The examples below serve to illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br><br>
N-(Tetrahydropyran-4-yl)-4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide<br>
At 0°C, a solution of 0.63 g (3.0 mmol) of 4-thfluoronicotinoyl chloride in a little dichloromethane was added dropwise to a solution of 0.30 g (3.0 mmol) of 4-aminotetrahydropyran (prepared by reductive amination of tetrahydropyran-4-one; NH3/H2/Ni, 100 bar, 50°C) and 0.35 g (3.5 mmol) of triethylamine in 25 ml of dichloromethane. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for another two hours, saturated sodium chloride solution was added and the phases were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted two more times with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried and concentrated. This gave 0.46 g (67.8% of theory) of product as a colorless solid of melting point 149 - 150°C.<br><br><br>
Analogously to Example A, equimolar amounts of 4-aminotetrahydrothiopyran (prepared from tetrahydrothiopyran-4-one via the corresponding oxime and subsequent reduction with lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran) and 4-trifluoromethylnicotinoyl chloride were reacted in the presence of triethylamine. This gave, after silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate), the amide as a colorless solid of melting point 161-163° C. (Yield 51.3% of theory).<br><br>
At 0°C, a solution of 1.23 g (5 mmol) of 70% strength 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in 25 ml of dichloromethane was added dropwise to a solution of 1.45 g (5 mmol) of N-(tetrahydrothiopyran-4-yl)-4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide (Example B) in 50 ml of dichloromethane. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours and then extracted with sodium carbonate solution, and the organic phase was dried. Concentration gave a colorless oil which crystallized after trituration with ethyl acetate. Filtration with suction gave 1.0 g (65.3% of theory) of product of melting point 243 - 244°C<br><br><br>
At 0°C, a solution of 2.46 g (10 mmol) of 70% strength 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in 50 ml of dichloromethane was added dropwise to a solution of 1.45 g (5 mmol) of N-(tetrahydrothiopyran-4-yl)-4-trifluormethylnicotinamide (Example B) in 50 ml of dichloromethane. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours and extracted with sodium carbonate solution, and the organic phase was dried. Concentration gave a colorless oil which crystallized after trituration with ethyl acetate. Filtration with suction gave 1.3 g (80.7% of theory) of product of melting point 248°C (decomposition).<br><br>
N-(2I2-Dimethyl-1I3-dioxa-cyclohexyl)-4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide<br>
In the presence of 0.50 g of p-toluolsulfonic acid hydrate, 2.64 g (10 mmol) of N-(4-trifluoromethylnicotinoyl)serinol and 4.20 g (40 mmol) of acetone dimethyl acetal in 50ml of toluene were stirred at 80°C for 12 hours, with distillative removal of the methanol that was formed. After cooling, the mixture was extracted with dilute sodium hydroxide solution and water and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. This gave 1.5 g of product (49.3% of theory) as a colorless solid of melting point 155-156°C.<br><br>
3.9 g (20 mmol) of 4-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid and 3.2 g (20 mmol) of carbonyl diimidazole in 100 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran were stirred at 40 - 50°C for 6 hours. After cooling, 1.8 g (20 mmol) of serinol were added, and stirring was continued at<br><br>
50 - 60° C for another 4 hours. The crude product obtained after removal of the solvent under reduced pressure was purified by silica gel chromatography. This gave 2.9 g of product (55.3% of theory) of melting point 155-156°C.<br>
The compounds listed in the tables below can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

C.       Biological examples<br>
In Examples 1 to 3 below, compounds are considered to be active when, at a concentration of 500 ppm (based on the content of active compound) or less, they have an effect on the harmful organisms of 50% or more.<br>
Example 1<br>
Germinated field bean seeds (Vicia faba) with seed roots were transferred into brown glass bottles filled with tap water and then populated with about 100 black bean aphids (Aphis fabae). Plants and aphids were then dipped into an aqueous solution of the formulated compound to be examined for 5 seconds. After they had drained, plants and animals were stored in a climatized chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40-60% relative atmospheric humidity). After 3 and 6 days of storage, the mortality of the compound on the aphids was determined. The compounds of the following examples were active: 3, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (cis), 22 (trans), 24, 30 (cis), 30 (trans), 31 (cis), 124, 134, 135, 161, 163, 164, 166, 203,216, 219, 353 and 356.<br>
Example 2<br>
Germinated field bean seeds (Vicia faba) with seed roots were transferred into brown glass bottles filled with tap water. Four milliliters of an aqueous solution of the formulated compound to be examined were pipetted into the brown glass bottle. The field bean was then heavily populated with about 100 black bean aphids (Aphis fabae). Plants and aphids were then stored in a climatized chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40-60% relative atmospheric humidity). After 3 and 6 days of storage, the root-systemic effect of the compound as aphid mortality was determined. The compounds of the following examples were active: 3,8,9,10,11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (cis), 22 (trans), 24, 30 (cis), 30 (trans), 31 (cis), 35, 124, 128, 134, 135, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 203, 216, 219, 237, 250, 353 and 356.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) having in each case two well-developed leaves were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous solution of the formulated compound to be examined. After drying, in each case one treated bean plant, one untreated bean plant and one bean plant heavily infected by white flies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) were grouped together. The plants were placed in a greenhouse at 25°C and 60% relative humidity. After 48 hours, the number of eggs which had been laid on the treated and the untreated bean plants was determined. The degree of repellent action was obtained by relative comparison of the number of eggs on the untreated plant (corresponds in each case to 100%) with the number of eggs on the treated plant. In this repellent test, the compound of the following example was active: 19.<br>
Example 4<br>
Soybean plants having in each case three well-developed leaves were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous solution of the formulated compound to be examined. After drying, in each case on treated plant, one untreated plant and one plant infected with thrips of the species frankliniella occidentalis were grouped together. The plants were stored in a climatic chamber (23°C, 50-60% relative atmospheric humidity). After 14 days, the leaf damage was determined on the treated and untreated plants. The degree of repellent action was obtained by relative comparison of the leaf damage of the untreated plant (corresponds in each case to 100%) with the leaf damage of the treated plant. In this repellent test, the compound of the following example was active: 19.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
