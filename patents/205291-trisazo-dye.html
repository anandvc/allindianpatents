				<td>REACTIVE TRISAZO DYES<br>
This invention relates to reactive dyes containing two units each comprising a monoazo chromophore linked to a triazinylamino group, each of which units is linked by a diamine unit disposed between the triazine rings.<br>
GB-A-1283771 discloses a range of reactive diamine dyes of the formula (A)<br><br><br><br><br>
where D is naphthylazo-phenylene or -naphthalene containing at least 3 sulphonic acid groups, R is H or an optional substituted C1-4 alkyl group and the linking group -N(H)-X-N(H)- is derived specifically from a phenylene, diphenylene or naphthalene diamine. They offer a degree of fixation over a wide range of liquor to goods ratios and provide shades of very good light fastness.<br>
WO-A-99/05223 discloses a range of dyes in which the diamine unit disposed between the triazine rings itself forms part of a chromophoric group. Such dyes have the formula<br><br>
wherein:<br>
Ar1 is an optionally substituted arylene group;<br>
Ar2 is an optionally substituted aryl group;<br>
each of D1 and D2, independently, is a chromophoric group;<br>
each of R1, R2, R3 and R4, independently, is H or alkyl; and<br><br>
2 each of X1 and X2 independently, is a labile atom or group.<br>
Such dyes provide excellent build up properties, as well as excellent light fastness and aqueous solubility. Moreover, the dyes offer a degree of fixation over a wide range of liquor to goods ratios.<br>
However, none of the dyes disclosed in the abovernentioned documents-provide-a. particularly-strong or bright yellow, reddish yellow or red shade with good migration properties excellent buiId-up and good fastness,properties..<br>
Thus, the problemrvaadressed by.the.invention is to provide such a dye capable; of giving, particularly on cellulosic fabrics, a strong, bright yellow, reddish yellow or red shade with good migration properties, excellent build-up and which dyes are particularly easy and economical to produce.<br>
We find surprisingly that it is possible to solve the abovementioned problems by the use of a trisazo dye in which two monoazo triazine dyes, the respective monoazo dye components of which are each based on a sulphonated naphthol, especially sulpho-J-acid, as coupling component and a markedly electron deficient aromatic amine as diazo component, are linked, via the resctive..triazine-groups,-by a diamine unit which itself forms.part of a monoazo chromophore. Moreover, such dyes colour cloth more economically than those of WO-A-99/05223.<br><br>
or an alkali metal salt thereof;<br>
Thus, according to one aspect the invention provides a trisazo dye of the formula (I)<br><br>

The dyestuffs of the present invention can be present as a preparation in solid or liquid (dissolved) form. In solid form they generally contain the electrolyte salts customary in the case of water-soluble and in particular fibre-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and also the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of establishing a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, sodium dihydrogen-phosphate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, small amounts of siccatives or, if they are present in liquid, aqueous solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type customary in print pastes), substances which ensure the permanence of these preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In general, the dyestuffs of the present invention are present as dye powders containing 10 to 80% by weight, based on the dye powder or preparation, of a strength-standardizing colorless diluent electrolyte salt, such as those mentioned above. These dye powders may additionally include the aforementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to 10%, based on the dye powder.   If the dye<br><br>
14<br>
mixtures of the present invention are present in aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions is up to about 50 % by weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, and the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions will preferably be below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solutions. The aqueous solutions {liquid preparations) may include the  aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to 10% by weight, for example 0.1 to 10% by weight, preference being given to up to 4% by weight, especially 2 to 4% by weight.<br>
A trisazo dye of the formula (I), given and defined above, may-be prepared by a process which comprises reacting an arylazodiamine of the formula (XIV)<br><br>
wherein each of Ar1, Ar2, R3 and R4 is as defined above, with an equimolar proportion of each of two reactive dyes respectively of the formula<br>
wherein each of D1, R1 and X1 is as defined above and X3 is a labile atom or group capable of reaction with an amine and<br><br>
wherein each of D2, R2 and X2 is as defined above and X4 is a labile atom or group capable of reaction with an amine,<br><br>
15<br>
or when each of D1 ,R1 ,X1 and X3 is the same as D2, R2, X2 and X4 respectively, with two moles of a reactive dye of the formula (XV) or (XVI) per mole of the diamine of the formula (XIV), to obtain the dye of the formula (I).<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an aqueous solution at pH 4 - 6 and at a temperature of at least 30°C.<br>
In such a process, when each of D1 ,R1 and X1, in the formula (I), is the same as D2, R2 and X2 respectively, a single triazine dye may be employed and this may have the formula<br><br>
However, if any of D1 ,R1 and X1 is different from D2, R2and X2 respectively, it is necessary to employ an additional triazine dye which may have the formula<br><br>
In the respective formulae (XVII) and (XVIII), each of Ar3, R1, R2, X1, X2, a, b and c is as defined above;<br>
each of Ar3, a, b and c in respective formula (XVII) and (XVIII) may be the same as or different from the other; and each of X3 and X4 independently is a labile atom or group capable of reaction with an amine.<br><br>
16<br>
Such triazine dyes may be prepared either separately or together by diazotizing one or two amine(s) of the formula<br><br>
wherein each of Ar3/ a and b is as defined above; and coupling the diazotized amine(s) of the formula (X!X) to a triazine compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein each of R1, R2, X1, X2, X3 and X4 and c is as defined above; to obtain the triazine dye{s) of the formula {XVII) and/or {XVIII).<br>
Typically, diazotisation of the amine is carried out in an acid medium at a pH of about 2-5, using, for example, acetic, propionic or hydrochloric acid in the presence of a nitrosating agent, such as nitrosyl sulphuric acid, an alkali metal nitrite {e.g. sodium nitrite) or a C1-4 alkyl nitrite (e.g. methyl nitrite) at a temperature of from 10°C to 1 0°C.<br>
The coupling reaction may be carried out by adding the diazotised amine{s) of the formula (XIX), to the triazine compound(s) of the formula (XX) and/or (XXI) in water at a temperature of from 0 to 1 0°C.<br>
The triazine compound of the formula (XX) and/or (XXI), given and defined above, may be prepared by reacting an aminonaphthalenesulphonic acid compound of the formula (XXII)<br><br>
17<br><br>
wherein c is as defined above;<br>
with a cyanuric halide of the formula (XXIII) and/or (XXIV)<br><br>
wherein each of X5 and X6 is a labile atom or group capable of reaction with an amine and each of X1, X2, X3 and X4 is as defined above, to form the triazine compound of the formula (XX) and/or (XXI).<br>
The reaction may be carried out by adding the aminonaphthalene sulphonic acid compound of the formula (XXII) dropwise to a slurry of the cyanuric halide of the formula (XXIII) and/or (XXIV) in an ice/water/acetone mixture.<br>
Dyes embodying the invention may be applied alone or in admixture with other dyestuffs.<br>
Although in this specification, dye formulae have been shown in the form of their free acid, the invention also includes dyes and processes using dyes in the salt form, particularly their salts with alkali metals such as the potassium, sodium, lithium or mixed sodium/lithium salt.<br>
The dyes may be used for dyeing, printing or ink-jet printing, for example of textile materials and paper.<br>
The process for colouration is preferably performed at a pH of 7.1 to 13, more preferably 10 to 12. pH levels above 7 can be achieved by performing the process for colouration in the presence of an acid-binding agent. They can be applied at any<br><br>
18<br>
temperature from room temperature (e.g. 15°C) to 80°C, preferably from 40 to 60°C.<br>
The substrate may be any of fibre material such as a textile material, leather, paper, hair or film, but is preferably a natural or artificial textile material containing amino or hydroxyl groups, for example textile material such as wool, silk, polyamides and modified polyacrylonitrile fibres, and more preferably a cellulose, for example, that commercially available as Tencel. For this purpose the dyes can be applied to the textile materials at a pH above 7 by, for example, exhaust dyeing, padding or printing. Textile materials are coloured bright shades and possess good fastness to light and wet treatments such as washing.<br>
The new dyes are particularly valuable for colouring cellulosic textile materials. For this purpose, the dyes are preferably applied to the cellulosic textile material at a pH above 7 in conjunction with a treatment with an acid-binding agent.<br>
Preferred acid-binding agents include alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, metasilicates and mixtures thereof, for example sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium metasilicate, sodium hydroxide and the corresponding potassium salts. The dyes benefit from excellent build-up and high fixation.<br>
The new dyes can be applied to textile materials containing amine groups, such as wool and polyamide textile materials, from a neutral to mildly alkaline dyebath. The dyeing process can be carried out at a constant or substantially constant pH, that it to say the pH of the dyebath remains constant or substantially constant during the dyeing process, or if desired the pH of the dyebath can be altered at any stage of the dyeing process.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for colouring a fibre material containing a group reactive with a reactive dye or a fibre blend containing the fibre material, which method comprises applying thereto a dye of the formula (I), given and defined above, preferably at a pH above 7.<br><br>

Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples, in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of the dye:<br><br>
where L is as chromophoric linking group of the formula<br><br>
The process may be represented by the following reaction scheme.<br><br>
20<br><br>
A solution of 2-amino-5-hydroxy-1,7-naphthalene disulphonic acid (30) {39.0g,0.08mol) in water {500m1s) was added dropwise to a slurry of cyanuric chloride (31) (1 6.2g,0.088mol) in an ice/water/acetone mixture and stirred for 1 hr, furnishing a solution of the dichlorotriazinyl coupler (32).<br>
2N Sodium nitrite solution (51 mls) was added dropwise to an ice cold slurry of 2-amino-5-( -sulphatoethyl suiphone)benzene sulphonic acid (45.2g, 0.093mol) and concentrated HCI(30mls) in water (500mls). After 1 hr, excess nitrous acid was destroyed, by addition of sulphamic acid, leaving a solution of the diazonium salt (33). The solution of the diazonium salt was then added to the dichlorotriazine solution (32) and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature maintaining the<br><br>
21<br>
pH at 6. After 4hrs the resulting precipitate was filtered off and dried to give the reddish yellow dichlorotriazinyl dye (70g) (34). Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
A mixture of the dichlorotriazinyl dye (34)(8.0g, 0.007mol) and diamine (35) (1.9g,0.0035mol) in water {200mls) at pH 5.5 was heated at 60°C for 5hrs, the pH being maintained by the addition of 2N sodium carbonate. The mixture was cooled and the product precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits. The precipitate was filtered off and dried to give reactive dye (1) (6.6g)   max = 480nm   =75000. Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
Examples 2 - 26<br>
In Examples 2 - 26, the chromophoric linking group L of Example 1 was replaced by the respective groups shown in Table 1 below and the dyes were prepared in a manner analogous to that of Example 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
25<br><br>
Example 27 Preparation of the dye:<br><br>
where L is a chromophoric linking group of the formula 27<br><br>
26<br><br>
The process may be represented by the following reaction scheme.<br><br>
A solution of cyanuric chloride (31 )(8.1 g,0.044mol) in acetone (150mls) was added dropwise to a solution of 1 -amino-8-hydroxy-3,6-naphthalene disulphonic acid<br><br>
27<br>
(36)(15.5g,0.04mol) in water (300mls) cooled to 
2N Sodium nitrite solution (27.5mls) was added dropwise to an ice cold slurry of 2-amino-5-( -sulphatoethyl sulphone) benzene sulphonic acid (25.9g/0.05mol) and concentrated HCI (15mls) in water (150mls). After 1hr, excess nitrous acid was destroyed by addition of sulphamic acid, leaving a solution of diazonium salt (33). The solution of the diazonium salt (33) was then added to the dichlorotriazine coupler solution (37) and the mixture allowed to warm to room temperature maintaining the pH at 5. After 2hrs, the product (38) was precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits then redissolved in water for further use.<br>
2-Aminonaphthalene-4,8-disulphonic acid (19.5g,0.05mol) in water (200mls) and 2N sodium nitrite solution (27.5mls) were mixed and the resulting solution added dropwise to a stirred mixture of ice/water (100g) and concentrated HCI (15mls). After 1hr, excess nitrous acid was destroyed by the addition of sulphamic acid, leaving a solution of the diazonium salt.<br>
Meta-phenylene diamine (5.0g,0.045mol) was dissolved in 2N HCI (50m!s) and the solution added to the solution of the diazonium salt. The mixture was then maintained at pH6 for 2hrs, and the resulting precipitate filtered off and dried to give the monoazo diamine (39)(18.7g). Analytical data were in full agreement with the expected structure.<br>
A mixture of the dichlorotriazinyl dye (38)(0.0046mol) and the diamine (39)(1.25g,0.0023mol) in water (1 70mls) at pH 5.0 was heated at 65°C for 3hrs, the pH being maintained by the addition of 2N sodium carbonate. The mixture was cooled and the product precipitated by the addition of methylated spirits. The precipitate was filtered off and dried to give reactive dye (2)(6.0g)   max = 502nm = 51200. Analytical data were in full agreement wit the expected structure.<br><br>
