				<td>HOME ZONE SERVICE METHOD FOR MOBILE TELEPHONE<br>
SUBSCRIBERS IN MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a home zone service for a portable mobile<br>
telephone subscriber within a mobile telecommunication network. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to a method for improving accuracy and performance in<br>
providing a home zone service.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
A home zone service is known as allocating a predefined zone, known as "home<br>
zone", so that a different charging rate can be applied to a mobile telephone subscriber,<br>
depending on whether the subscriber is located within the home zone when placing a call.<br>
Thus, a mobile subscriber can selectively designate a number of different home zones at<br>
a given time as the mobile subscriber moves from one geographic location to another<br>
geographic location.<br>
If the vicinity of a subscriber's residential area were defined as the home zone<br>
service area, a service charge equivalent to a local wired telephone service can be<br>
applied to a mobile phone subscriber. But, if a call is made outside of the home zone, a<br>
higher charging rate corresponding to a radio telephone call rate is applied to the<br>
subscriber.<br>
If a subscriber requests a home zone service, the boundary of the home zone is<br>
determined according to various factors, such as the position (latitude/longitude) of the<br>
base station with respect to the subscriber's address, the base station coverage area, the<br>
installation conditions of the base station, the multi-path characteristics of the base<br>
station area, etc.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, a cell site is divided into a plurality of sectors.<br>
Accordingly, a home zone can be defined to include the whole cell area (base station) or<br>
one of the sectors. In determining the home zone, however, the accuracy of home zone<br>
recognition is important to the service providers in terms of the amount of revenue they<br>
can generate. A minor error in determining the home zone boundary, causing the<br>
widening of the home zone boundary, can cost a significant revenue loss to the service<br>
providers. Thus, the ability to accurately recognize the home zone boundary when a<br>
subscriber originates (or terminates) a call within the home zone is important in boosting<br>
revenue for service providers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the<br>
problems occurring in the related art, and an object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a home zone service method which can perform a more accurate way of determining<br>
whether a mobile subscriber is located within the home zone service when making a call<br>
connection.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is<br>
provided a home zone service method for associating a predetermined zone to a mobile<br>
telephone subscriber and charging the subscriber at different billing rates based on<br>
whether the subscriber makes a telephone call inside or outside the home zone. The<br>
method includes the steps of: associating a plurality of reduced charging areas with a<br>
mobile subscriber, wherein the boundary of reduced charging area is defined as a first<br>
measurement value and a second measurement value, and wherein the first value and the<br>
second value are measured based on a mean round trip delay from a plurality of<br>
locations within the sector of a cell site to which the subscriber is located in relation to<br>
the neighboring base stations, then preparing a home zone database including the<br>
measured first value and the second value; calculating a round trip delay of a request<br>
signal of the mobile subscriber to establish a call connection; and, determining whether<br>
the subscriber is inside the home zone if the calculated round trip delay falls between the<br>
first value and the second value retrieved from the home zone database.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, if the mobile phone is located<br>
within the home zone, the subscriber is informed of whether he/she is located within the<br>
home zone.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the predetermined home<br>
zone data base is stored and retrieved from a data base management center.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Reference will now be made in greater detail to the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the drawings, the same elements are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. For the purpose of clarity,<br>
a detailed description of well-known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted as it may make the subject matter of the present invention unclear.<br>
Fig. 2 is a view illustrating the concept of a sub-sector defining a home zone<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention. A home zone can be defined<br>
based on a cell site (base station) or one of the sectors of the cell site. The home zone<br>
designated within the sector may be called a sub-sector based home zone, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, a sector #2 of a cell #1 is divided into, for example, a<br>
plurality of sub-sectors #1 - #3. This division of a sector into different sub-sector zones<br>
is performed using a round trip relay (RTD) value. As an example, the division of the<br>
sub-sectors #1 and #2 is realized based on the RTD_1 boundary and the division of the<br>
sub-sectors #2 and #3 is realized based on the RTD_2 boundary. The calculation of the<br>
RTD_1 and the RTD_2 used to designate different home zones is discussed later in the<br>
specification.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B are other views illustrating the concept of determining a sub-<br>
sector based home zone according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 A, if a subscriber 100 is position at a given location, a portion<br>
of the sector #2 of a cell #10 can overlap a portion of the sector #1 of a cell #11. As<br>
shown in Fig. 3B, the location of the subscriber can be overlapped by two different<br>
home zones. Thus, the subscriber 100 belongs not only to the sub-sector defined by the<br>
RTD2max boundary and the RTD2min boundary in the sector #2 of the cell #10, but it<br>
also belongs to the sub-sector defined the RTD,max boundary and the RTD,min<br>
boundary in the sector #1 of the cell #11. Thus, if a subscriber 100 makes a telephone<br>
call in either of the two sub-sectors, a fee corresponding to a local call will be charged to<br>
the mobile phone subscriber.<br>
Now, the process of calculating the RTD to define a home zone will be explained<br>
in detail.<br>
If it is assumed that a circular home zone is determined to include a fixed region<br>
(for example, around the house of the mobile subscriber), the maximum and the<br>
minimum distance between the home zone and a neighboring base station can be defined<br>
according to a sendee provider or user. At this time, the minimum distance is the<br>
shortest distance among lineal distances leading from the base station to the inner<br>
boundary of the home zone. The maximum distance is the longest distance among lineal<br>
distances leading from the base station to the outer boundary of the home zone which is<br>
in the opposite direction of the inner boundary of the home zone. These distances can<br>
be determined using a round trip delay (RTD). The RTD represents the value obtained<br>
by dividing the distance by the propagating speed (i.e., C = 300,000Km/sec), then<br>
multiplying the divided value by 2 to counter for the turnaround distance. The base<br>
station measures the turnaround time by measuring the time during which a radio wave<br>
radiated from the base station reaches the mobile terminal and return back to the base<br>
station. This can be expressed by the following equation:<br>
RTD_i = 2 x (D_i / C).<br>
Here, "i" represents 1 or 2. "D_i" represents a variable that represents a minimum<br>
distance when "i" is 1 and represents a maximum distance when "i" is 2.<br>
In order to enhance the accuracy of the boundary of the home zone using the<br>
RTD values, the following complementary measures are further performed.<br>
An approximate distance from the base station to the respective location can be<br>
linearly calculated. Since the turnaround time between the base station and the mobile<br>
terminal is calculated by a digital signal processor (DSP) of the base station, the RTD<br>
value can be obtained by dividing the calculated distance by the propagation speed then<br>
multiplying the divided value by 2. However, the radio wave is transmitted in a<br>
multipath characteristic environment. Thus, a delay time caused by the multipath<br>
characteristics of the radio wave can affect the RTD calculation. Typically, the delay<br>
time involved in similar background areas exhibit similar delay characteristic. Thus, in<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, the delay time involved in different<br>
background is collectively measured and their mean values are measured to create a<br>
database, which defines the reduced charging area. The delay times vary depending on<br>
different location where the mobile phone might be located, such as a downtown area, a<br>
shopping center, apartment or factory building area, etc. Thus, using the previously<br>
determined database which accounts for various multipath characteristics, a more<br>
accurate RTD value can be obtained to define the home zone.<br>
In order to provide a more accurate RTD, an initial database is added with a<br>
delay time obtained by collecting and averaging different delay times at a given rate<br>
between various locations and its neighboring base stations in a real world environment.<br>
Then, a mean RTD value can be obtained at a given location of the mobile phone. As<br>
part of the effort to determine an accurate RTD value, which is used to designate the<br>
reduced charging area, another factor is measured in deriving the test database. Since<br>
most users would tend to define their residential areas as the home zone to benefit the<br>
lower billing rate, the test database is obtained by estimating the time that the users will<br>
most likely be at their residence. For instance, since there is a greater possibility that the<br>
subscriber stays in his/her house during the time period between 24:00 to 06:00, the<br>
experimented mean RTD value is measured at this time duration.<br>
Fig. 4 is a table exemplifying the subscriber information database for the home<br>
zone service according to the embodiment of the present invention. The database shows<br>
that two subscribers have been registered.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, the first subscriber, Mr. Gil-dong Hong, who resides in<br>
123 Seohyun-Dong, Bundang-Ku, uses 0342-779-8180 as a local number inside the<br>
home zone and uses 011-779-xxxx as a mobile number outside his home zone. Mr.<br>
Hong's house is under the service provided by three neighboring base stations. The<br>
home zone registered by Mr. Hong is defined by the region within the range of 16 - 40<br>
chips from an a sector of a base station 1. At this time, the values of 16 and 40<br>
represent the minimum RTD and the maximum RTD, respectively, but the actual<br>
distance corresponds in the range of 8 - 20 chips from the base station since the RTD<br>
takes into account the round trip between the base station and the mobile phone. Thus,<br>
the home zone is associated in the range of 10 - 22 chips for the (3 sector of a base station<br>
2 and in the range of 12 ~ 24 chips for the y section of a base station 3. Here, the<br>
distance of one chip represents 245m, which is obtained by dividing the distance by the<br>
radio propagation speed, 300,000Km/sec, by the code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
modulation frequency of 1.2244MHz.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flowchart illustrating the home zone identifying process operated<br>
directly by the subscriber according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With reference to Fig. 5, a subscriber can directly dial the specified keys (for<br>
example, *89) of the mobile terminal to ascertain whether he/she is within the home<br>
zone using a mobile terminal MS. The dial information according to the above call is<br>
transmitted to the base station BS (step 51). The base station receives the dial<br>
information and simultaneously calculates the RTD accordingly (step 52). Then, the<br>
base station transmits the dial information and the calculated RTD to a mobile switching<br>
center (step 53). The mobile switching center requests to retrieve the database from a<br>
database management center (DBM) and in turn receives the corresponding database<br>
from the DBM (steps 54 and 55). Here, for convenience, the DBM is used as a term<br>
which includes the home location registration (HLR), the visitor location registration<br>
(VLR), the location determination module, the service provision center (LDSPC), the<br>
customer care center (CCC), etc. Performing various operations among the HLR, VLR,<br>
LDSPC, and CCC and performing communication between the mobile switching center<br>
and the DBM should be obvious to those in this art.<br>
Thereafter, the base station checks the service class of the subscriber, the<br>
maximum RTD value (RTDma) and the minimum RTD value (RTDmin) based on the<br>
retrieved database (step 56). The subscriber selects the sendee class when he/she<br>
requests the home zone service. Then, the subscriber can select the service either in the<br>
home zone only or both services including the home zone and the mobile zone, which is<br>
outside of the home zone.<br>
If the subscriber is registered for the home zone service and requests such service,<br>
the base station, after checking that the subscriber qualifies for the home zone service<br>
based on the retrieved database, transmits a home-zone identifying signal to the mobile<br>
terminal through a traffic channel. If the condition is not satisfied, the base station<br>
transmits a non-home-zone identifying sound (step 57). At this time, the mobile<br>
terminal displays the information whether or not the current location of the mobile<br>
terminal is within the home zone, so that the subscriber can be informed (step 58).<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the home zone identifying process operated by a<br>
mobile terminal according to the embodiment of the present invention. The home zone<br>
identifying process enables the mobile terminal to identify whether the mobile terminal<br>
is located within the home zone and enables the mobile terminal to automatically display<br>
a deviation signal if the mobile terminal deviates outside of the home zone. Thus, the<br>
mobile station stores the home zone list (step 61).<br>
The base station transmits the base station ID and the sector ID to the mobile<br>
terminal (step 62). Then, the mobile terminal ascertains whether the base station<br>
belongs to its home zone with reference to a home zone list (step 63) and transmits a<br>
location registration request if the base station belongs to the home zone (step 64). The<br>
base station receives the location registration request and simultaneously calculates the<br>
RTD (RTD1) accordingly (step 65). The mobile switching center transmits a location<br>
registration request, the base station information, and the calculated RTD (RTD1) to the<br>
DBM (step 66). At this time, the DBM transmits a response including a predetermined<br>
base station information based on the home zone database to the mobile switching center.<br>
That is, information corresponding to the maximum RTD value (RTDmax) and the<br>
minimum RTD (RTDmin) relating to the subscriber is obtained (step 68). The mobile<br>
switching center checks whether the calculated RTD (RTD1) falls within the range<br>
between the maximum RTD (RTDmax) and the minimum RTD (RTDmin) based on the<br>
predetermined database (step 69). If the condition is satisfied, the mobile switching<br>
center transmits a home-zone identifying signal to the mobile terminal through the traffic<br>
channel (step 70a), while if the condition is not satisfied, the mobile switching center<br>
transmits a non-home-zone identifying signal to the mobile terminal (step 70b). Then,<br>
the mobile terminal displays whether its current location is located within the home zone<br>
to inform the subscriber (step 71).<br>
As described above, the present invention has advantages in that it can perform a<br>
more accurate and efficient home zone service by determining whether the mobile<br>
terminal is located within the home zone by comparing the predetermined sector-based<br>
home zone range to the current location of the mobile terminal.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that<br>
other modifications thereof may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention. Thus, the invention should not be limited to the disclosed embodiment but<br>
