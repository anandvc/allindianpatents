BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[02] The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for the<br>
cancellation of interference in the reception of wide-band, sequence encoded<br>
waveforms, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for the construction of<br>
interference matrices for a Coded Signal Processing Engine (CSPE) with the intent to<br>
cancel interference and improve reception, in terms of signal-to-noise (SNR) and bit<br>
error rate (BER). The CSPE may be used to improve the acquisition, tracking and<br>
demodulation of a sequence encoded (spread spectrum) signal in an interference-limited<br>
environment, where interference is defined as signals inlended for other receivers. Such<br>
improvements may enhance capacity, coverage and data rates of spread spectrum<br>
systems, such as those that employ code-division multiple access (CDMA).<br>
Furthermore, such improvements may enhance the ability to determine the receiver's<br>
geographical location, namely a mobile unit in a cellular system (geo-location).<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
[03] In spread spectrum systems, whether it is a wireless communication system, a<br>
Global Positioning System (GPS) or a radar system, each transmitter may be assigned a<br>
unique code and in many instances each transmission from a transmitter is assigned a<br>
unique code. The code is nothing more than a sequence (often pseudorandom) of bits.<br>
Examples of codes include Gold codes (used in GPS - see Kaplan, Elliot D., Editor,<br>
Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications, Artech House 1996), Barker codes<br>
(used in radar - see Stimson, G.W., "An Introduction to Airborne Radar", SciTech<br>
Publishing Inc., 1998) and Walsh codes (used in communications systems, such as<br>
cdmaOne - See IS-95). These spreading codes may be used to spread the signal across a<br>
specified range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
[04] Assigning a unique code to each transmitter allows the receiver to distinguish<br>
between different transmitters. An example of a spread spectrum system that uses<br>
unique codes to distinguish between transmitters is a GPS system.<br>
[05] In some instances, such as in a coded radar system, each pulse is assigned a<br>
unique code so that the receiver is able to distinguish between different pulses by the<br>
codes.<br>
[06] If a single transmitter has to broadcast different messages to different receivers,<br>
such as a base station in a wireless communication system broadcasting to multiple<br>
mobiles, one may use codes to distinguish between messages for each mobile. In this<br>
scenario, each symbol for a particular user is encoded using the code assigned to that<br>
user. By coding in this manner, the receiver, by knowing its own code, may decipher<br>
the message intended for it from the superposition of message signals received.<br>
[07] In some communication systems, a symbol is assigned to a sequence of bits that<br>
comprise a message. For example, a digital message may be grouped into sets of M bit<br>
sequences where each unique sequence is assigned a symbol. For example, if M=6, then<br>
each set of 6 bits may assume one of 26 = 64 possibilities. Such a system would<br>
broadcast a waveform, called a symbol, which would represent a sequence of<br>
transmitted bits. For example, the symbol a might denote the sequence 101101 and the<br>
symbol (3 might denote the sequence 110010. In a spread spectrum system, these<br>
symbols are referred to as codes. An example of such a communication system is the<br>
mobile to base station (forward/down) link of cdmaOne.<br>
[08] Of course, all of these techniques may be combined to distinguish between<br>
transmitters, messages, pulses and symbols in a single system. The key idea in all of<br>
these coded systems is that the receiver knows the code(s) of the message intended for<br>
it. By applying the code(s) correctly to the received signal, the receiver may extract the<br>
message for which it is intended. However, such receivers are more complex than<br>
receivers that distinguish between messages by time and/or frequency alone.<br>
Complexity arises because the signal received is a linear combination of all the coded<br>
signals present in the spectrum of interest at any given time. The receiver must be able<br>
to extract the message intended for it from this linear combination of coded signals.<br>
[09] The following section presents the problem of interference in linear algebraic<br>
terms and provides a method by which it may be cancelled.<br>
[10] Let H be a matrix containing the spread signal from source number 1 and let ?1<br>
be the amplitude of the signal from this source. Let s1 be the spread signals for the<br>
remaining sources and let i, be the corresponding amplitudes. Suppose that the receiver<br>
is interested in source number 1. The signals from the other sources may be considered<br>
to be interference. The received signal is:<br><br>
[12] where n is the additive noise term and p is the number of sources in the spread<br>
spectrum system. Let the length of the vector y be N, where N is the number of points<br>
in the integration window. The value of N is selected as part of the design process and<br>
is a trade-off between processing gain and complexity. N consecutive points of y will<br>
be referred to as a segment corresponding to a correlation length.<br>
[13] In a wireless communication system, the columns of the matrix H represent the<br>
various coded signals of interest and the elements of the vector ? are the amplitudes of<br>
the respective coded signals. For example, in the base station to mobile link of a<br>
cdmaOne system, the coded signals may include the various channels, i.e., pilot, paging,<br>
synchronization and traffic, of each base station's line-of-sight (LOS) or multipath<br>
signals. In the mobile to base station link, the columns of the matrix H may be the<br>
coded signals from a mobile LOS and/or one of its multipath signals.<br>
[14] In a GPS system, the columns of the matrix H are the coded signals being<br>
broadcast by the GPS satellites at the appropriate code, phase and frequency offsets.<br>
[15] In an array application, the columns of the matrix are steering vectors, or<br>
equivalent array pattern vectors. These vectors characterize the relative phase recorded<br>
by each antenna in the array as a function of the location and motion dynamics of the<br>
source as well as the arrangement of the antennas in the array. In the model presented<br>
above, each column of the matrix H signifies a steering vector corresponding to a<br>
particular source.<br>
[16] Equation (1) may now be written in the following matrix form:<br><br>
[17] where<br>
H: spread signal matrix of the signal of interest<br>
?: amplitude vector of the source of interest<br>
S = [S2 ... sp]: spread signal matrix of all the other signals, i.e., the interference<br>
 = [2...p]: interference amplitude vector<br>
[18] Baseline receivers correlate the measurement, y, with a replica of H or a column<br>
vector of H to determine if H or the column vector is present in the measurement. If H<br>
is detected, men the receiver knows the bit-stream transmitted by source number 1.<br>
Mathematically, this correlation operation is:<br><br>
[20] where T is the transpose operation.<br>
[21] Substituting for y from equation (2) illustrates the source of the power control<br>
requirement:<br><br>
[23] The middle term, (HTH)-1HTS, in the above equation is the source of the<br>
near-far problem. If the codes are orthogonal, then this term reduces to zero, which<br>
implies that the receiver has to detect 0 in the presence of noise, i.e., (HTH)-1HTn only.<br>
As the amplitudes of the other sources with non-orthogonal codes increase, the term<br>
(HTH)-1HTS contributes a significant amount to the correlation, which interferes with<br>
the detection of 0.<br>
[24] The normalized correlation function, (HTH)-1HT , defined above, is in fact a<br>
matched filter and is based on an orthogonal projection of y onto the space spanned by<br>
II. When H and S are not orthogonal to each other, there is leakage of the components<br>
of S into the orthogonal projection of y onto H. This leakage is geometrically illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. Note in Figure 1, that if S were orthogonal to H, the leakage component is<br>
zero as is evident from equation 4. The CSPE utilizes projective methods to provide a<br>
solution to this interference leakage issue.<br>
[25] The coded signal-processing engine (CSPE) was designed to address non-<br>
orthogonal leakage. The CSPE may mitigate at least two types of interference: cross-<br>
channel and co-channel. The first kind of interference results from one source's signals<br>
bleeding into the acquisition and tracking channels of another source. This will be<br>
referred to as cross-channel interference. The second type of interference occurs when<br>
one or more signals, e.g., a line-of-sight and/or multipath signal, interfere with the<br>
ability to acquire a second, third or fourth multipath signal from the same source. This<br>
type of interference will be referred to as co-channel interference.<br>
[26] The analysis of cross-channel and co-channel interference mitigation begins by<br>
considering the measurement model of equation (2). An orthogonal projection onto the<br>
space spanned by the columns of H and S may be decomposed as shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
[29] Two cases of the detection problem were considered. In the first case, it is<br>
assumed that the measurement noise variance is known, while in the second case it is<br>
assumed that it is unknown.<br>
[30] Case 1: Known measurement noise variance<br>
[31] Assuming that the variance of the measurement noise is known to be s2, the test<br>
statistic for detecting signals in the subspace H, with interference from S is given by<br>
Scharf L.L. and B. Friedlander, "Matched Subspace Detectors," IEEE Trans Signal Proc<br>
SP- 42:8,pp. 2146-2157 (August 1994):<br><br>
[33] Case 2: Unknown measurement noise variance<br>
[34] The uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for detecting contributions from H,<br>
while rejecting contributions from S, when the measurement noise variance is unknown,<br>
has been derived in the literature and is given by:<br><br>
[36] A concept presented by Scharf &amp; Friedlander is to project the measurement y<br>
onto the space G and to perform the detection test in G. This projection onto G may be<br>
viewed in the following equivalent ways: parallel to the space S, perpendicular to the<br>
space that is perpendicular to S, and oblique to the space H.<br>
[37] Therefore, an efficient process by which an interference matrix may be<br>
constructed for the purpose of interference mitigation in the reception of coded signals<br>
is needed. In addition, a method and apparatus is needed that will construct an<br>
interference matrix for a coded signal-processing engine (CSPE). Several specific<br>
methods are discussed to implement the method and apparatus to provide efficient<br>
signal cancellation, which may facilitate acquisition, tracking and demodulation of the<br>
signal of interest.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[38] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
constructing an interference matrix S to provide interference mitigation through its use<br>
in a coded signal-processing engine (CSPE) to facilitate acquisition, tracking and<br>
demodulation of the signal of interest.<br>
[39] It is a further object to provide a method for providing interference mitigation,<br>
without requiring knowledge of absolute power, using various methods of constructing<br>
the interference matrix S. Interference selected for cancellation may include a plurality<br>

signals.<br>

[43] It is yet another object to provide a method for the cancellation of a plurality of<br>
channels from a plurality of transmitters and a plurality of multipath signals.<br>
[44] It is yet another object to provide interference mitigation using no knowledge of<br>
relative signal amplitude between the channels, absolute power of the channels or the<br>
bits transmitted.<br>
[45] It is yet another object to provide interference mitigation using knowledge of the<br>
bits transmitted, but no knowledge of relative signal amplitude between the channels or<br>
absolute power of the channels.<br>
[46] It is yet another object to provide interference mitigation with knowledge of<br>
relative signal amplitude between the channels, but no knowledge of the absolute power<br>
of the channels.<br>

above embodiments.<br>
[48] In all of the above embodiments, it is an object to provide an improved method<br>
for interference mitigation.<br>
[49] Finally, it is an object of the invention to provide a method for constructing the<br>
interference matrix S for use in the CSPE for interference mitigation.<br>

(SNR) or bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, it may provide for the acquisition, tracking<br>
and demodulation of coded signals that were previously concealed by interference.<br>

Description<br>
[129] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying<br>
drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific<br>
illustrative embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments<br>
are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the<br>
invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that<br>
logical, mechanical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to<br>
be taken in a limiting sense.<br>
[130] The forward link of a communication system includes a plurality of base stations<br>
or sources that are configured for radio communication with one or more receivers or<br>
mobile units, such as wireless telephony devices. The mobile units are configured to<br>
receive and transmit direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) signals<br>
to communicate with a plurality of base stations. The base station transmits radio<br>
frequency (RF) signals, the RF signals formed by modulating an RF carrier with a<br>
baseband signal. The baseband signal is formed by spreading data symbols with a<br>
periodic spreading sequence having a period substantially greater man the number of<br>
chips per symbol.<br>
[131] In a CDMA system, each source and each receiver is assigned a unique time<br>
varying code that is used to spread that source's digital bit stream. These spread signals<br>
from all sources are observed by the receiver and the received signal may be modeled as<br>
a linear combination of signals from a plurality of sources in additive noise. The<br>
weighting of each source is determined from the amplitude of each source's signal and<br>
the square of the amplitude represents the transmission power of the source. Signals<br>
intended for other receivers appear as structured interference.<br>
[132] The processing architecture of current PN coded receivers is illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
A PN coded signal 300 at radio frequency (RF) is received at receiver antenna 302.<br>
Frequency down-conversion from RF to intermediate frequency (IF) is performed by<br>
conversion circuit 304 prior to sampling and conversion from analog to digital by an<br>
A/D circuit 306. The digital IF signal is passed to a number of processing channels 308,<br>
310 and 312 that may perform signal processing operations of acquisition, tracking and<br>
demodulation. It should be appreciated that any number of signal processing channels<br>
may be utilized in conjunction with the teachings of the present invention. While the<br>
detailed description may include signal acquisition in each receiver finger, the invention<br>
is inclusive of receivers that do not perform signal acquisition individually in each<br>
finger. For illustrative purposes, only three fingers, .308, 310, and 312 have been<br>
illustrated. However, the invention is not limited to that number of fingers, but instead<br>
is inclusive of an arbitrary number of processing fingers. Additional processing stages<br>
A, B and C may be included in each processing channel. Furthermore, in all<br>
descriptions the signals are not decomposed into in-phase (1) and quadrature (Q)<br>
components. However, the receiver architectures depicted are inclusive of receivers that<br>
perform this decomposition into I and Q and process these representations separately.<br>
[133] The baseline receiver converts the received signal from a radio frequency (RF)<br>
signal 300 to either an intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal and then<br>
discretely samples the digital signal generated by A/D circuit 306. Tn the detailed<br>
description, IF will be inclusive of the case of a zero frequency carrier, namely<br>
baseband. For example, the RF reference signal is given as:<br><br>
[135] where (f)RF is the RF angular frequency and m is one of the four possible values of<br>
phase in p/4-QPSK.<br>
[136] Effectively, the baseline receiver multiplies received RF signal 300 by a<br>
reference carrier to produce a signal composed of an IF or baseband component and a<br>
high frequency component.<br><br>
[138] Low-Pass Filtering removes the high frequency component and yields the analog<br>
signal defined by:<br><br>
[140] which may be discretely sampled to provide digital data downstream of<br>
converter 306.<br>
[141] Within each processing channel shown in Fig. 3, we focus on signal acquisition<br>
(314, 316 and 318) and signal tracking functions (320, 322 and 324) within a channel.<br>
Note that an alternative embodiment has a single acquisition finger that is shared by all<br>
other processing fingers, eliminating the need for an acquisition stage in every<br>
processing finger. Blocks 326, 328 and 330 may be provided to perform additional<br>
functionality. These functions are presented in Figure 4 and discussed in detail, below.<br>
[142] In Fig. 4 the architectural layout is presented of a single data processing channel<br>
for eliminating both cross-channel and co-channel interference. A single data<br>
processing channel is designed to acquire and track the signal from a single source.<br>
[143] In the architecture presented, the single data processing channel consists of<br>
multiple fingers 400, 400' and 400" where each finger consists of a code generation<br>
module 402, 402' and 402" (for building S matrix); modules 404, 404' and 404": an<br>
acquisition module 410, 410', and 410" and a tracking module 412, 412' and 412". The<br>
tracking module consists of frequency lock loops (FLLs) or frequency estimators 822,<br>
822' and 822"; phase locked loops or phase estimators (PLLs) 420, 420' and 420"; as<br>
well as delay locked loops or code offset estimators (DLLs) 818. 818' and 818". Each<br>
processing finger 400, 400' and 400" within a channel has the function of acquiring and<br>
tracking a distinct multipath signal from the same source. While only three fingers are<br>
depicted, this invention is inclusive of an arbitrary number of fingers.<br>
[144] In order to understand how the architecture depicted in Fig. 4 works, the starting<br>
assumption may be used that this channel has just been assigned to track the signals<br>
from a particular source and that the system is already in the process of acquiring and<br>
tracking other sources.<br>
[145] The input data to this channel arrives in the form of a digital IF data stream.<br>
Since there are other sources being tracked, replicate code generator module 402, 402'<br>
and 402" would generate the appropriate S matrix and this matrix is used to create <br>
404, 404' and 404". In this case, the digital IF data stream y is provided as input into <br>
module. The output of this module 404 is fed into acquisition module 410 in the same<br>
finger. However, this invention is also inclusive of a single acquisition module<br>
architecture, in which the results are provided to a plurality of tracking fingers.<br>
[146] In case the system was not tracking any other sources, then there would be no S<br>
matrix generated and therefore no Ps1 function. In this case, the input digital IF data<br>
stream is passed directly into the acquisition stage.<br>
[147] The acquisition stage identifies the LOS signal and all its multipath copies from<br>
the source of interest. If the acquisition stage identifies more than one multipath, then<br>
multiple tracking sections are used for each multipath signal individually. The outputs<br>
of tracking stages 412, 412' and 412" may be the code, phase, and Doppler offsets that<br>
are used to build the S matrix in the other channels.<br>
[148] Now suppose that due to co-channel interference, acquisition stage 410 was only<br>
able to acquire fewer multipaths than there are available processing fingers, i.e., a<br>
plurality of multipath signals are buried in co-channel interference. In that case, the<br>
information from the acquisition stage is used to track the signals identified.<br>
Information about the code, phase and Doppler offsets of the first signals being tracked<br>
are obtained from tracking system 412 and are provided as input into replicate code<br>
generator modules 402' and 402" and are used in producing a reference code that<br>
includes the correct code offset, phase and/or frequency.<br>
[149] As a result, the S matrix built in processing finger 400' includes the code of the<br>
lone signal being processed in finger 400. As a result, finger 400' will eliminate interfer-<br>
ence from all the other sources as well as the dominant signal from the source of interest<br>
tracked by processing finger 400. Acquisition module 410' in processing finger 400'<br>
then acquires the multipath signal which is now visible because interference from the<br>
dominant signal has been eliminated. That multipath is then tracked in tracking module<br>
412' and the tracking information may be provided to both finger 400 (to improve its<br>
ability to track the dominant signal) as well as to the other fingers, e.g., 400" to aid in<br>
identifying and tracking additional weak multipath signals. The tracking information<br>
from all these modules is used to perform Rake combining operation 420 for data<br>
demodulation.<br>
[150] Now that the overall system architecture has been discussed, :he discussion will<br>
focus on the creation of interference matrix S. The interference matrix S is a column<br>
matrix composed of interference signal vectors s and is of the form [s1 s2 ... sp]. It is an<br>
Nxp matrix where N denotes the segment length of the signal and p is the number of<br>
interference signal vectors where p may be dynamically selected. The number of active<br>
channels p may be dynamically selected by selecting those that exceed a specified<br>
threshold, a subset of the strongest channels based upon the ranking of channels or by<br>
other such methods of selection. The determination of the p channels to be included in<br>
the construction of interference matrix S may be performed for each symbol (at the<br>
symbol rate) or if the cancellation is performed over more than one symbol, the<br>
determination may be determined at that rate. Each column vector s is of the form [s(to)<br>
s(t1) ... s(tN)]T where s(tj) denotes a discrete signal, part of a signal or composite signal,<br>
sampled in time. The rank of the matrix is p, where p = N, to avoid rank deficiency.<br>
[151] In the following discussion, each vector s will be specified with a number of<br>
indices, i.e., sijkm, where the subscript i denotes whether the method uses additional<br>
information such as bits transmitted or relative power, j is the transmitter identification<br>
number, the subscript k is the channel identification number and the superscript m is the<br>
multipalh identification number (line-of-sighl (LOS) is 0 and the multipath signals are 1,<br>
2, 3, and so on based on time of arrival at the receiver). The i subscript is 'b' if the<br>
method uses knowledge of bits transmitted, 'p' if the method uses relative signal<br>
amplitude or the subscript is absent for methods that do not use knowledge of bits<br>
transmitted or signal amplitude.<br>
[152] The simplest construction of S uses no knowledge of symbols transmitted or<br>
relative signal amplitude. However, use of knowledge of the symbols transmitted in the<br>
construction of S may be used to resolve ambiguities that may appear due to symbol<br>
boundary misalignment. If a symbol changes value in successive intervals it may<br>
interfere with the construction of interference matrix S. If the symbols are estimated<br>
through relative power computations or by determining the bil(s) trsnsmitted and used<br>
in the construction of S then boundary alignment problem between multiple signals is<br>
effectively solved. Boundary misalignment problems occur whenever an interference<br>
vector is constructed that contains any portion of more than one modulated symbols.<br>
[153] Furthermore, another method for cancellation is the composite method that<br>
facilitates rank reduction of S by using information of the relative signal amplitude of<br>
the interfering signal channels. The amplitude of each channel is estimated and that<br>
estimate is used to scale each replica signal.<br>
[154] Construction of interference matrix S will be categorized into four primary<br>
embodiments with secondary embodiments under each. The primary embodiments<br>
consist of the construction of interference matrix S for a single transmitter, multiple<br>
transmitters, a single transmitter with multipath and multiple transmitters with<br>
multipath. Each primary embodiment includes different representations in the sections<br>
containing the secondary embodiments. These representations include the following<br>
categories: no knowledge of bits transmitted or power; knowledge of bits transmitted,<br>
but not of power; and knowledge of relative signal amplitude.<br>
Single Transmitter with No Multipath<br>
[155] The simplest embodiment is an interference matrix S constructed for the<br>
cancellation of only one transmitter with one or more channels, where each channel is<br>
distinguished by a unique PN code. This method for constructing S is discussed in the<br>
following subsections.<br>
No knowledge<br>
[156] Cancellation of one channel without any knowledge of power or bits transmitted<br>
is accomplished using the following interference matrix S:<br><br>
[158] Without loss of generality, the s vector represents the line of sight (LOS)<br>
interference signal from channel 1 of transmitter one. The indices may be changed<br>
according to the transmitter and channel to be cancelled without departing from the<br>
teachings of the present invention.<br>
[159] Cancellation of more than one channel from the same transmitter without any<br>
knowledge may be accomplished using a multi-rank S of the following type:<br><br>
[161] Without loss of generality, the transmitter has at least n active channels and S is<br>
comprised of a subset of vectors corresponding to these channels. Thus, the interference<br>
matrix may be composed of any number of column vectors less than or equal to the<br>
segment length N without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[162] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Bits Transmitted<br>
[163] Another method for constructing single and multi-rank interference matrices S is<br>
to use knowledge of the bits transmitted. The construction of S is similar to the no<br>
knowledge case. Cancellation of one channel with knowledge of bits transmitted is<br>
accomplished using the following S:<br><br>
[165] Without loss of generality, the s vector represents the LOS interference signal of<br>
channel 1 from transmitter one. Specifically, sb is defined as an interference reference<br>
vector constructed using bit info. The indices may be changed according to the<br>
transmitter and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[166] Cancellation of more than one channel from the same transmitter with<br>
knowledge of bits transmitted may be accomplished using a multi-rank interference<br>
matrix S, such as the following:<br><br>
[168] Without loss of generality, the transmitter has at least n active channels and S is<br>
comprised of a subset of these signal vectors. Thus, the interference matrix may be<br>
composed of any number of column vectors less than or equal to the segment length N<br>
without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[169] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Relative Signal Amplitude<br>
[170] Another method for constructing interference matrix S is to use the relative<br>
signal amplitudes of the channels. As in the previous methods discussed in this<br>
embodiment, it is possible to form a single rank interference matrix S for one channel or<br>
a multi-rank interference matrix S for multiple channels. However, an advantage to the<br>
composite interference vector (CIV) method is that it provides rank reduction, i.e., a<br>
reduction in the rank of interference matrix S while still providing cancellation of<br>
multiple channels, corresponding to a higher rank S. The previous methods cancel the<br>
same number of interference signal vectors as the rank of S, while rank reduction allows<br>
for the cancellation of a greater number of signal vectors than the rank of interference<br>
matrix S.<br>
[171] While the previous methods do not require any knowledge of power, this<br>
composite method requires estimation of the relative signal amplitude of the channels to<br>
be cancelled. The simplest embodiment is that of a single rank S that consists of<br>
multiple channels. Form the composite interference vector:<br><br>
[173] Where the subscript p denotes that relative signal amplitude is used in<br>
constructing the interference signals that are summed over channel index k. For the<br>
following discussion, vector sp is defined as the interference veotor scaled by the<br>
amplitude, specifically sp = s? where ? is the amplitude including sign. For example, if<br>
the channels to be canceled are 1-3, 5, 7 then the index k ranges from 1-3, 5, 7.<br>
Moreover, the composite interference vector may be represented as Thus, the<br>
composite interference vector effectively contains the information of several<br>
interference signals in a compact form.<br>
[174] This composite interference vector may be used in the construction of a single<br>
rank interference matrix S that uses knowledge of relative signal amplitude:<br><br>
[176] without loss of generality, this single rank matrix will effectively cancel<br>
channels 1-3, 5 and 7 of the LOS from one transmitter.<br>
[177] Additionally, multi-rank interference matrices may be constructed from several<br>
composite interference vectors. Without loss of generality, the following interference<br>
matrix may be constructed to cancel a plurality of channels of one transmitter with a<br>
plurality of composite interference vectors:<br><br>
[179] The first signal vector effectively cancels channels 1-4 and 8; the second vector<br>
cancels channels 5 and 6: and the third vector cancels channels 7, 9-10 and 13.<br>
[180] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Combination of Methods<br>
[181] The three aforementioned methods may be combined in any combination to form<br>
interference matrix S in the cancellation of channels from one transmitter. For example,<br>
one may form an S matrix composed of all three methods:<br><br>
[183] The first vector uses no information to cancel channel 1, the second vector uses<br>
bit information to cancel channel 2 and the last vector uses relative signal amplitude to<br>
form a composite interference vector to cancel channels 3-5, 7 and 10.<br>
[184] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Multiple Transmitters with No Multipath<br>
[185] Another embodiment of interference matrix S is constructed for the cancellation<br>
of multiple transmitters with one or more channels each, where each transmitter and<br>
channel is distinguished by a PN code.<br>
No knowledge<br>
[186] Cancellation of the same channel over a plurality of transmitters without any<br>
knowledge of power or bits transmitted is accomplished using the following interference<br>
matrix S:<br><br>
[188] Without loss of generality, s vectors represent LOS interference signal from<br>
transmitters one, two and four of channel 2 for each transmitter. The indices may be<br>
changed depending on the transmitters and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[189] Cancellation of more than one channel from a plurality of transmitters without<br>
any knowledge of power or bits transmitted may be accomplished using the following<br>
multi-rank S:<br><br>
[191] Without loss of generality, transmitter three has at least n active channels while<br>
transmitters one and two have at least 1 and 3 channels respectively. S is comprised of a<br>
subset of these potential interference signals. Interference matrix S may be composed of<br>
any number of column vectors less than or equal to the segment length N without<br>
departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[192] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Bits Transmitted<br>
[193] Another method for constructing single and multi-rank interference matrices S is<br>
to use knowledge of the bits transmitted. The construction of interference matrix S is<br>
similar to the no knowledge case. Cancellation of the same channel across multiple<br>
transmitters with knowledge of the bits transmitted is accomplished using an S, such as<br>
the following:<br><br>
[195] Without loss of generality, s interference vectors represent LOS interference<br>
signal for channel 2 from transmitters one, three and four. The indices may be changed<br>
according to the transmitters and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[196] Cancellation of more than one channel from multiple transmitters with<br>
knowledge of the bits transmitted may be accomplished using the following multi-rank<br>
interference matrix S:<br><br>
[198] Without loss of generality, the third transmitter has at least n active channels and<br>
the first and second transmitters have at least 1 and 3 channels, respectively. The<br>
interference matrix may be composed of any number of column vectors less than or<br>
equal to the segment length N without departing from the teachings of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[199] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Relative Signal Amplitude<br>
[200] Another method for constructing interference matrix S is to use the relative<br>
signal amplitudes of the channels. As in the previous methods in this embodiment, it is<br>
possible to form an S matrix with one signal vector for each interfering channel or a<br>
multi-rank S for a plurality of interfering channels with a signal vector for each channel<br>
of each transmitter. However, an advantage of the composite method is that it allows<br>
for rank reduction, a reduction in the rank of S while providing cancellation of multiple<br>
channels that would normally require a higher rank S.<br>
[201] While the previous methods do not require any knowledge of power, this method<br>
requires estimation of the relative signal amplitude of the channels to be cancelled. The<br>
simplest embodiment of this method is that of a single rank S that consists of multiple<br>
channels from multiple transmitters. Form the following composite vector by summing<br>
over the indices j and k and including the corresponding interference vectors to be<br>
cancelled. Note that the interfering vectors will only be included for the j and k indices<br>
that may have been dynamically selected for inclusion.<br><br>
[203] The subscript p denotes that relative signal amplitude is used in constructing the<br>
composite interference vector by summing over the channel index and the transmitter<br>
index. For the following discussion, vector sp is defined as an interference vector scaled<br>
by its relative amplitude, specifically sp = s? where ? is the relative amplitude. For<br>
example, if the index k ranges over channels 1-3 for transmitter one and channels 3-5<br>
and 7 for transmitter two, the composite vector may be represented as <br>
 The composite vector effectively contains the information of several<br>
interference signals from a plurality of transmitters and channels.<br>
[204] This composite vector may be used in the construction of an interference matrix<br>
S that uses knowledge of relative signal amplitude:<br><br>
[206] Without loss of generality, this single rank matrix will effectively cancel LOS<br>
channels 1-3 of transmitter one and LOS channels 3-5 and 7 of transmitter two.<br>
[207] Additionally, multi-rank interference matrices may be constructed of several<br>
composite signals. Without loss of generality, an interference matrix such as the<br>
following may be constructed to cancel several channels of multiple transmitters with a<br>
plurality of composite signal vectors:<br><br>
[209] The first signal vector effectively cancels LOS channels 1-4 and 8 of transmitter<br>
one; the second vector cancels LOS channels 5 and 6 of transmitter two; and the third<br>
vector cancels LOS channels 7, 9-10 and 13 of transmitter three and LOS channels 1-2<br>
of transmitter four.<br>
[210] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Combination of Methods<br>
[211] The three aforementioned methods may be combined in any combination to form<br>
the interference matrix S for the cancellation of multiple channels and multiple<br>
transmitters. For example, one may form an S matrix composed of all three methods:<br><br>
[213] The first two vectors provides LOS cancellation of channel 1 from transmitter<br>
one and channel 4 from transmitter two with no information, the next two vectors<br>
provide LOS cancellation of channel 2 from transmitter one and channel 1 from<br>
transmitter four using bit information and the last two vectors use relative signal<br>
amplitude information to form composite interference vectors to cancel channels 1-10 of<br>
transmitter seven and channels 3-5, 7, 10 of transmitter eight and channels 1-3 of<br>
transmitter nine.<br>
[214] Tt should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Single Transmitter with Multipath<br>
[215] Another embodiment of interference matrix S may be constructed for the<br>
cancellation of a single channel from a transmitter and its multipath copies. Each<br>
channel is distinguished by a PN code for each line-of-sight or multipath signal, but note<br>
that PN codes will be shared between each multipath signal. Without loss of generality,<br>
the first signal received is referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) and subsequent signals as<br>
multipath signals 1, 2, 3, ... etc.<br>
No knowledge<br>
[216] Cancellation of one channel for several multipath signals without any knowledge<br>
of power or bits transmitted is accomplished using an interference matrix S such as the<br>
following:<br><br>
[218] Without loss of generality, s vectors represent the interference signal for channel<br>
2 from LOS signal and multipath signals 1 and 3 from transmitter one. The indices may<br>
be changed depending on the transmitters and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[219] Cancellation of more than one channel from one transmitter with multipath<br>
without knowledge of power or bits transmitted may be accomplished using a multi-<br>
rank S, such as the following:<br><br>
[221] The interference matrix is composed of LOS of channel 1; first multipath of<br>
channels 2 and 3; and second multipath of channels 1, 2 and 4 all of transmitter one.<br>
The interference matrix may be composed of any number of column vectors less than or<br>
equal to the segment length N without departing from the teachings of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[222] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Bits Transmitted<br>
[223] Another method for constructing single and multi-rank interference matrices S is<br>
to use knowledge of the bits transmitted. Construction of S is similar to the no<br>
knowledge case. Cancellation of one channel across multiple transmitters with<br>
knowledge of bits transmitted is accomplished using an S such as the following:<br><br>
[225] without loss of generality, s vectors represent the interference signals for channel<br>
2 from LOS and multipath signals two and three from transmitter one. The indices may<br>
be changed according to the multipath signals and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[226] Cancellation of more than one channel from one transmitter's LOS and<br>
multipath signals with knowledge of bits transmitted may be accomplished using a<br>
multi-rank S, such as the following:<br><br>
[228] without loss of generality, the transmitter has at least n active channels.<br>
Interference matrix S is composed of n channels of LOS signal, channels 1 and 2 of the<br>
first multipath and channel 1 of the second multipath. Interference matrix S may, in<br>
general, be composed of any number of column vectors less than or equal to the<br>
segment length N without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
[229] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Relative Signal Amplitude<br>
[230] Another method for constructing interference matrix S is to use the relative<br>
signal amplitudes of each of the channels. As in the previous methods in this<br>
embodiment it is possible to form interference matrix S with one signal vector for each<br>
channel's LOS or multipath signal for a particular transmitter. An advantage of the<br>
composite method is that it allows for rank reduction, a reduction in the rank of<br>
interference matrix S while still providing cancellation of multiple channels.<br>
[231] While the previous methods do not require any knowledge of power, this method<br>
requires estimation of the relative signal amplitude of the channels to be cancelled. The<br>
simplest embodiment is that of a single rank S that consists of multiple LOS and<br>
multipath channels from one transmitter. Form the composite interference vector:<br><br>
[233] where subscript p denotes that relative signal amplitude is used in constructing<br>
the interference vector by summing over channel index (k) and multipath index (j) and<br>
including the corresponding interference vectors to be cancelled. Note that the<br>
interfering vectors will only be included for the j and k indices that may have been<br>
dynamically selected for inclusion. For the following discussion, vec:or sp is defined as<br>
the interference vector scaled by the amplitude, specifically sp = s?. For example, if the<br>
index k ranges from channels 1-3 for LOS signal and channels 3-5 and 7 for first<br>
multipath signal, the composite vector may be represented as <br>
 The composite vector effectively contains the information of several<br>
interference signals from one transmitter's LOS and multipath signals for multiple<br>
channels.<br>
[234] This composite vector may be used in the construction of an interference matrix<br>
S that uses knowledge of relative signal amplitude:<br><br>
[236] Without loss of generality, this single rank matrix will effectively cancel<br>
channels 1-3 of LOS signal and channels 3-5 and 7 of the first and third multipath<br>
signals.<br>
[237] Additionally, multi-rank interference matrices may be constructed of several<br>
composite signals. Without loss of generality, the following interference matrix may be<br>
constructed to cancel several channels of several multipath signals with a plurality of<br>
composite signal vectors:<br><br>
[239] The first signal vector effectively cancels channels 1-4 and 8 of LOS signal and<br>
first multipath; the second vector cancels channels 5 and 6 of the first multipath; and the<br>
third vector cancels channels 7, 9-10 and 13 of multipath two and channels 1-2 of<br>
multipath three.<br>

not limited to the specific example.<br>
Combination of Methods<br>
[241] The three aforementioned methods may be combined in any combination to form<br>
interference matrix S in the cancellation of the channels of one transmitter and its<br>
multipath copies. For example, one may form an S matrix composed of all three<br>
methods:<br><br>
[243] The first two vectors use no knowledge to cancel LOS signal of channel 1 from<br>
transmitter one and the first multipath of channel 4 from transmitter one; the next two<br>
vectors use bit information to cancel LOS signal of channel 2 from transmitter one and<br>
the third multipath of channel 1 from transmitter one; and the las1: two vectors use<br>
relative signal amplitude information to form composite interference vectors for the<br>
sixth multipath of channels 1-10 of transmitter one and channels 3-5, 7 and 10 of<br>
multipath seven and channels 1-3 of multipath eight from transmitter one.<br>
[244] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S; the inventive concept is<br>
not limited 1o the specific example.<br>
Multiple Transmitters with Multipath<br>
[245] Another embodiment of interference matrix S is constructed for the cancellation<br>
of a plurality of transmitters and their multipath signals with one or more channels each.<br>
Each channel is distinguished by a PN code for each line-of-sight or multipath signal,<br>
but note that PN codes will be shared between the transmitter's LOS and multipath<br>
signals and that relative power will be consistent between the channels in each multipath<br>
signal from the same transmitter. Without loss of generality, the first signal is referred<br>
to as line-of-sight (LOS) and subsequent signals as multipath signals one, two, three, ...<br>
etc.<br>
No knowledge<br>
[246] Cancellation of one channel for a plurality of multipath signals and a plurality of<br>
transmitters without any knowledge of power or bits transmitted is accomplished using<br>
an interference matrix S such as the following:<br><br>
[248] Without loss of generality, s vectors represent the interference signals<br>
corresponding to channel 2 from LOS and multipath signals one; and three from<br>
transmitter one, LOS and multipath signal one from transmitter two and LOS signal<br>
from transmitters three and four. The indices may be changed depending on the<br>
transmitters and channel to be cancelled.<br>
[249] Cancellation of more than one channel from a plurality of transmitters with a<br>
plurality of multipath signals without any knowledge of power or bits transmitted may<br>
be accomplished using a multi-rank interference matrix S, such as:<br><br>
[251] without loss of generality, interference matrix S is composed of signals from<br>
multiple transmitters: channel 1 of LOS signal, channels 2 and 3 from the first<br>
multipath signal, and channel 1 of the second multipath for transmitter one; channel 1<br>
and 2 of LOS signal and channel 1 of the second multipath for transmitter two; channel<br>
1 of LOS and first multipath signal for transmitter three: and channel 4 of the first<br>
multipath for transmitter four. Interference matrix S may be composed of any number<br>
of column vectors less than or equal to the segment length N without departing from the<br>
teachings of the present invention.<br>
[252] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Bits Transmitted<br>
[253] Another method for constructing single and multi-rank intcrfc::cnce matrices S is<br>
to use knowledge of the bits transmitted. The construction of interference matrix S is<br>
similar to the no knowledge case. Cancellation of the same channel across multiple<br>
transmitters with multipath and knowledge of the bits transmitted is accomplished using<br>
an S such as the following:<br><br>
[255] without loss of generality, s interference vectors represent the interference<br>
signals for channel two from LOS and multipath signals of multiple liansmitters. The<br>
signals include LOS and the second multipath signal for transmitter one, LOS signal<br>
from transmitter two, the second multipath from transmitter three, the second multipath<br>
from transmitter five and the third multipath from transmitter seven. The indices may be<br>
changed according to the transmitters, channels and multipath signals to be cancelled.<br>
[256] An example of cancellation of more than one channel from multiple<br>
transmitters' LOS and multipath signals with knowledge of bits transmitted may be<br>
accomplished using a multi-rank S, such as the following:<br><br>
[258] Interference matrix S is composed of channel 1 of the second multipath and<br>
channel 2 of the first multipath for transmitter one; channel 1 of the first multipath for<br>
transmitter two; channel 1 of the second multipath and channel 2 of the third multipath<br>
for transmitter three: channel 3 of LOS for transmitter 4; channel 3 of the third<br>
multipath for transmitter 5; and channel 10 of the first multipath for transmitter 6. The<br>
interference matrix may, in general, be composed of any number of column vectors less<br>
than or equal to the segment length N without departing from the teachings of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[259] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing interference matrix S, the inventive concept is<br>
not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of Relative Signal Amplitude<br>
[260] Another method for constructing interference matrix S is to use the relative<br>
signal amplitudes of each of the channels. As in the previous methods in this<br>
embodiment, it is possible to form an S matrix with one signal vector for each channel's<br>
LOS or multipath signal. Note that the relative signal amplitude between a transmitter's<br>
channels will be consistent between the channels for each multipath signal. An<br>
advantage of using relative signal amplitude is that the composite method allows for<br>
rank reduction, a reduction in the rank of S while providing cancellation of multiple<br>
channels equivalent to a higher rank matrix using previous methods.<br>
[261] While the previous methods do not require any knowledge of power, this method<br>
requires estimation of the relative signal amplitude of the channels to be cancelled. The<br>
simplest embodiment is that of a single rank S that consists of multiple LOS and<br>
multipath channels from multiple transmitters. Form the composite vector:<br><br>
[263j where the subscript p denotes that relative signal amplitude is used in<br>
constructing the composite interference vector by summing over channel index (k),<br>
multipath index (m) and transmitter index (j) and including the corresponding<br>
interference vectors to be cancelled. Note that interference vectors will only be included<br>
for the j, k and m indices selected for inclusion. For the following discussion, vector sp<br>
is defined as the interference vector scaled by its relative amplitude, specifically sp = s?<br>
where ? is the relative amplitude. For example, if index k ranges from channels 1-3 for<br>
LOS signal and first multipath for transmitter one; channels 2-10 for multipath three<br>
from transmitter one; and channels 3-5 and 7 for multipath signal one for transmitter<br>
two, the composite vector may be represented as <br>
 The composite vector effectively contains the information of several<br>
interference signals from a plurality of transmitter's LOS and multipath signals for a<br>
plurality of channels.<br>
[264] This composite vector may be used in the construction of an nterference matrix<br>
S that uses knowledge of relative power, such as:<br><br>
[266] Without loss of generality, this single rank matrix will effectively cancel<br>
channels 1-3 of LOS signal and first multipath for transmitter one; channels 3-5 and 7 of<br>
the fourth multipath signal for transmitter two; and channels 2, 13-15 of the third<br>
multipath signal for transmitter three.<br>
[267] Additionally, multi-rank interference matrices may be constructed of several<br>
composite signals. Without loss of generality, the following interference matrix S may<br>
be constructed to cancel a plurality of channels and multipath signals with a plurality of<br>
composite signal vectors:<br><br>
[269] The first signal vector effectively cancels channels 1-4 and 8 of LOS signal for<br>
transmitter three; the second vector cancels channels 5 and 6 of the first and third<br>
multipath for'transmitter one; the third vector cancels channels 7, 9-10 and 13 of the<br>
second multipath for transmitter one and channels 1-2 of the third multipath for<br>
transmitter two; and the fourth vector cancels channels 3-18 of the fourth multipath for<br>
transmitter five and channels 1-2 of the fifth multipath for transmitter four.<br>

not limited to the specific example.<br>
Combination of Methods<br>
[271] The three aforementioned methods may be combined in any combination to form<br>
interference matrix S in the cancellation of the channels of multiple transmitters and<br>
their multipath. For example, one may form an S matrix composed of all three methods:<br><br>
[273] The first two vectors use no information of bits or power to cancel LOS signal<br>
from channel 1 of transmitter one and the first multipath of channel 4 from transmitter<br>
two; the next two vectors use bit information to cancel LOS signal of channel 2 from<br>
transmitter 4 and the third multipath signal of channel 3 from transmitter three; and the<br>
last two vectors use relative signal amplitude information to cancel ±e sixth multipath<br>
of channels 1-10 from transmitter five and the seventh and eighth multipath of channels<br>
3-5, 7, 10 of transmitter seven and the eighth multipath of channels 1-3 for transmitter<br>
eight.<br>

General CSPE Receiver Architecture<br>
[275] Fig. 5 provides a generalized CSPE receiver architecture 500. The generation of<br>
interference matrix S is conducted in CSPE module 520. Transmitted signal 501 is<br>
received by antenna 502 and frequency down-converted and sampled in ADC box 504.<br>
Control/logic module 506, depicted as two modules to simplify the connections and for<br>
clarity, provides appropriate information to the assignment of fingers 508, 510 and 512<br>

Searcher module 514 continually searches for signals to acquire. Fingers 508, 510, 512<br>

exemplary finger 510. A finger processor 516 is what is typically contained in finger<br>
510 of a baseline receiver. It may perform acquisition depending on the receiver<br>
architecture and tracks the assigned signal of interest. Power estimation module 518<br>
does power estimation that is used by control/logic module 506 to manage finger<br>

Correlation Length Issues<br>
[276] Interference signal vectors used in the construction of interference matrix S may,<br>
in general, be of an arbitrary segment length N. If the correlation length spans no more<br>
than one modulated symbol there is no sign ambiguity and the discussed embodiments<br>
hold true. However, if the correlation length spans more than one modulated symbol,<br>
there is a sign ambiguity existing between the modulated symbols within the segment.<br>
The projection operation, in the context of the CSPE, effectively projects a signal on a<br>
subspace orthogonal to an interference subspace that is in the direction of both the<br>
interference signal vector and its negative (anti-parallel direction). If the interference<br>
vector is composed of more than one modulated symbol then there are more than the<br>
two possible directions, i.e., the vector and the negative of the vector. Namely, portions<br>
of the vector may change sign, thereby changing the direction of rhe vector by some<br>
amount other than 180 degrees.<br>
[277] For example, an interference vector consisting of two symbols has four possible<br>
directions and, in general, a vector containing n modulated symbols may point in 2n<br>
different directions, depending on the sign of each modulated symbol. Therefore,<br>
interference subspace cancellation, without information regarding the bits transmitted or<br>
the transmitted relative amplitude is not possible in general, when the correlation length<br>
spans more than one modulated symbol, since there are multiple possible interference<br>
subspaces. Figure 6 depicts interference signals based on one modulated symbol and<br>
multiple modulated symbols.<br>
[278] In Figure 6a, element 600 depicts an arbitrary n-dimensional space with a single<br>
modulated symbol vector 602 corresponding to the direction of the projection operator<br>
based on a positive modulated symbol in the interference vector. The two possibilities<br>
for the true interference vector are 604 and 606, vectors representing a positive and a<br>
negative modulated symbol, respectively. Thus, with no information regarding the bit<br>
transmitted or relative signal amplitude it is possible to remove an interference signal<br>
vector by constructing a projection operator based upon the positive symbol. Element<br>
608 illustrates that the correlation length spans no more than one modulated symbol.<br>
[279] In Figure 6b, element 610 depicts an arbitrary n-dimensional space with a<br>
multiple modulated symbol vector 612 corresponding to the direction of the projection<br>
operator based on all positive modulated symbols in the interference vector. The<br>
multiple possibilities for the true interference vector include vectors 614, 616, 618, 620,<br>
622, 624, 626 and 628, which represent different combinations of positive and negative<br>
modulated symbols comprising the interference vector. Thus, wi:h no information<br>
regarding bits transmitted or relative signal amplitude it is not possible to correctly<br>
remove the interference signal vector by constructing a projection operator based upon<br>
all positive symbols. Therefore, it is necessary to have either bit information or relative<br>
signal amplitude information, both of which provide the appropriate s..gn for each of the<br>
modulated symbols contained in the interference vector in order to cancel across symbol<br>
boundaries. Element 630 illustrates that the correlation length spans more than one<br>
modulated symbol.<br>
[280] Knowing cither the bits transmitted (sign of the signal) or the relative signal<br>
amplitude of the transmitted signals specifics the interference subspace. The previously<br>
discussed embodiments will then hold true with the exception of the no information<br>
case.<br>
Estimation of Bits Transmitted<br>
[281] Some embodiments of the invention depend on estimation of the sign of the<br>
symbols (bits) transmitted in order to construct an interference matrix S. Correlating the<br>
real symbol in the data with a corresponding real reference signal provides an estimate<br>
of the bits transmitted. After correlation of the two symbol length vectors, a binary<br>
decision is made as to whether the symbol was sent or its inverse (negative). The<br>
correlation is performed with a real reference signal in order to determine the symbol<br>
sign. Namely, zero is the threshold: if the result is positive, then the symbol used for the<br>
reference signal was transmitted, otherwise if the result is negative, the inverse of the<br>
symbol was transmitted. This estimate is used in the construction of the corresponding<br>
interference vector. Depending on the sign decision, either the symbol used in the<br>
correlation is used in the construction of the interference matrix or its inverse. It is<br>
possible that channels may be inactive. It may be useful to set a threshold, such that<br>
below a particular threshold the channel will be ignored and considered inactive. For<br>
example, in IS-95 inactive traffic channels may be ignored by setting the threshold equal<br>
to the amplitude of the synchronization channel, which may be the weakest active<br>
channel, and only including channels whose amplitude is greater than the threshold.<br>
[282] Figure 7 illustrates the location of bit determination module 706 and process<br>
flow 700 associated therewith. After an acquisition module 702 and tracking module<br>
704, the data y and a reference signal x0 are passed to bit determination module 706. In<br>
bit determination module 706, the data is correlated with all codes used for<br>
channelization. For example, in cdmaOne the data and pilot reference signal (Walsh<br>
code 0) is passed to bit determination module 706 and the data is correlated with the 63<br>
other Walsh codes. Since IS-95 Walsh codes are based upon a tank 64 Hadamard<br>
matrix it is possible to use a Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) module to perform the<br>
correlation. In order to deal with the supplementary channels in cdma2000 a Fast Walsh<br>
Transform (FWT) may be used as well. A base-band example (zero carrier frequency)<br>
illustrates how the bit determination is performed. The data vector contains two<br>
consecutive modulated symbols, 708 and 710, where the brackets 'denote the symbol<br>
boundaries. The vector is correlated symbol by symbol with a reference signal 712.<br>
The correlation does not require normalization since a threshold decision is made about<br>
zero. However, if there is a bias in the signal the threshold may be displaced from zero.<br>
The correlation of modulated symbol 708 and reference signal 712 provides a positive<br>
result, implying that the symbol used in constructing reference signal 712 was<br>
transmitted (positive). In the present example, the correlation of y1 with X, (-1)(-<br>
1)+(1)(1)+(1)(1)-K-1)(-1)+(1)(1), would yield a value of positive 5. The correlation of<br>
modulated symbol 710 and reference symbol 712 provides a negative result, implying<br>
that the inverse of the symbol used in constructing reference symbol 712 was<br>
transmitted (negative). In the present example, the correlation of y2 with X, (-<br>
1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(-1 H(-1)(1)+(1)(-1), would yield a value of negative 5. It should be<br>
appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided to illustrate the<br>
concept of estimating the sign of bits transmitted; the inventive concept is not limited to<br>
the specific example.<br>
Estimation of Relative Amplitude<br>
[283] Some embodiments of the invention depend on estimation of the relative signal<br>
amplitude of the symbols transmitted in order to construct an interference matrix S,<br>
particularly the composite method. The methodology is similar to how the estimation of<br>
bits transmitted is performed. Correlating the real symbol in the data with a<br>
corresponding real reference signal provides an estimate of the relative amplitude of<br>
transmission. The correlation is performed with real vectors since it is important to<br>
capture the sign of the correlation, which corresponds to the sign of the symbol, along<br>
with the amplitude. It is possible that channels may be inactive. It may be useful to set<br>
a threshold, such that below a particular threshold the channel will be ignored. For<br>
example, in IS-95 inactive traffic channels may be ignored by setting the threshold as<br>
the power of the synchronization channel, which is typically the weakest active channel.<br>
[284] Figure 8 illustrates the location of bit determination module 806 and process<br>
flow 800 associated therewith. This process is similar to process 700. Acquisition<br>
module 802 and tracking module 804 provide the data vector y and reference vector x0<br>
to amplitude determination module 806. In module 806 the data is correlated with each<br>
of the codes used for channelization and is normalized according to the length of the<br>
vectors. For example, in CDMAOne the data is correlated with the other 63 Walsh<br>
codes. Since IS-95 Walsh codes are based upon a rank 64 Hadamard matrix it is<br>
possible to use a Fast Hadamard Transform (FHT) module to perform the correlation.<br>
Vectors 808, 810, 812, 814 and 816 provide a simple base-band example of signal<br>
amplitude determination. Data vector 808 is correlated with 4 reference codes 810, 812,<br>
814 and 816 and normalized. For example, yTX1= ¼[(2)(1)+(-4)(-1)+(0)(1)+(10)(l)];<br>
yTX2=¼L(2)(1)+(-4)(-1)+(0)(1)+(10)(-l)]; yTX3= ¼[(2)(l)+(-4)(1)+(0)(-1)+(10)(-1)];<br>
and yTX4=¼[(2)(1)+(-4)(-1)+(0)(-1)+(10)(1)]. The normalized correlations provide the<br>
results 2, -1, -3 and 4, respectively. If these interference vectors are used to construct a<br>
composite interference vector, vectors 810, 812, 814 and 816 should be scaled by the<br>
results of the correlation prior to summing. Thus, vector 810 is multiplied by 2, vector<br>
812 is multiplied by -1, vector 814 is multiplied by -3 and vector 816 is multiplied by<br>
4. It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided to<br>
illustrate the concept of estimating the amplitude of bits transmitted; the inventive<br>
concept is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Misalignment Issues<br>
[285] Knowledge of either the bits transmitted or the relative amplitude of the signals<br>
transmitted allows much greater flexibility in terms of cancellation as previously<br>
discussed. However, this induces some dependencies in terms of timing when<br>
performing the cancellation operation on signals whose symbol boundaries do not align.<br>
In effect, this induces a timing delay between the processing of signals in the order of<br>
the cancellation of signals.<br>
[286] Figure 9 shows that in order to cancel signal 1 from segment 2a, reference<br>
signals need to be generated for 1a and 1b. Furthermore, in order to cancel signals 1 and<br>
2 from segment 3a, reference signals for 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a and 2b need to be generated.<br>
This cascading effect leads to inherent timing delay due to symbol misalignment.<br>
[287] A serial approach for cancellation of multiple signals from the received data may<br>
be performed by successively canceling signals from the data in a cascading manner.<br>
Thus, signal 1 is cancelled from the data y, producing y(1), in order to facilitate the<br>
detection of signal 2 where the superscript denotes the number of signals canceled.<br>
Similarly, signal 2 may be cancelled from y(l) yielding y(2), allowing for the detection of<br>
an even weaker signal 3. For every signal cancellation, the minimum delay between the<br>
strongest signal and the weakest is increased by at minimum one correlation length.<br>
[288] Another approach to the cancellation of multiple signals is to "back-calculate"<br>
the reference signals, thereby augmenting interference matrix S and performing parallel<br>
cancellation. Rather than cancellation in a serial manner, all projection operators<br>
thereby operate on the received data y in a parallel sense. However, for each additional<br>
cancellation another interference vector is added to interference mutr:.x S. Cancellation<br>
of the first base station proceeds in the same manner as described in the serial<br>
cancellation method described above. The additional cancellations are performed in a<br>
slightly different manner than the serial cancellation method. Rather than canceling the<br>
second signal from y(1) the interference reference signal is used in conjunction with the<br>
interference reference signal used to create y(1) to form a higher rank interference matrix.<br>
Namely, the interference matrix for the first projection operator is of rank 1, the second<br>
projection operator is of rank 2, etc. Every cancellation operation is performed on the<br>
original y data vector. Note that this method still induces a delay for every signal<br>
cancelled.<br>
Example I<br>
[289] This example is of a telecommunications embodiment of the construction of the<br>
S matrix and issues involved with the formation of S. These issues are discussed in<br>
detail in the following sub-sections.<br>
[290] In the case of wireless communication in the forward link, it is assumed that the<br>
mobile does not have any prior knowledge about which channels are active other than<br>
the pilot, paging and synchronization channels. Moreover, it does not have any prior<br>
knowledge of the relative powers of the various channels including the traffic channels.<br>
Specifically in CDMAOne (see IS-95), one could cancel all 64 channels (for complete<br>
cancellation of a base station) or a subset of the channels at the appropriate code,<br>
Doppler and phase offsets estimated from the pilot channel. The following discussion<br>
pertains directly to IS-95, but with some changes, e.g., the addition of QOF codes,<br>
supplementary channels and QPSK modulation, it would be possible to easily extend<br>
this telecommunications embodiment to cdma2000 and is contemplated within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
No prior knowledge:<br>
[291] Recall that all the channels in the forward link are perfectly synchronized with<br>
the pilot channel in each finger. In order to entirely cancel each base station, all active<br>
channels must be cancelled in each LOS and multipath signal. The most straightforward<br>
approach to canceling the interference of one base station is to cancel all 64 channels<br>
from each signal corresponding to the same source. Under this scheme, for each<br>
multipath of the base station one wishes to cancel, the matrix S would be augmented<br>
with an additional 64 columns. However, one could also cancel a subset of the channels<br>
of one base station and its multipath signals to simplify the computational complexity<br>
and exploit the number of inactive channels and channels transmitting at low power<br>
relative to the threshold. Similarly, for each base-station and its multipath signals, we<br>
could continue to augment the S matrix with interference column vectors. Under the<br>
cdma2000 standards, one would also have to include the Quasi Orthogonal Function<br>
(QOF) codes, longer Walsh codes, supplementary channels (short Walsh codes) am<br>
QPSK modulation for the additional forward link channels. However, all of this is<br>
predicated on the correct alignment of the modulated symbols (Walsh symbols<br>
boundaries) in the received data.<br>
[292] Pilot only cancellation does not require symbol alignment, but the issue ha:<br>
relevance for all other cancellation methods. Pilot-only cancellation may be performe<br>
over arbitrary correlation lengths with no bit or relative amplitude information since<br>
there is no information transmitted on the pilot channel and thus no possibility of sign<br>
changes between consecutive symbols. Moreover, the pilot channel only cancellation<br>
methods have no limitation on correlation length. With misalignment, all the other<br>
methods require that cancellation occur on the scale of a Walsh symbol unless sign<br>
information or relative amplitude is used, thus the corresponding interference vector<br>
may only contain one Walsh symbol. Therefore, the methods that involve cancellation<br>
of more than just the pilot channel are limited to only one Walsh symbol for<br>
cancellation purposes.<br>
Pilot Only<br>
[293] Pilot only cancellation is accomplished by generating an interference reference<br>
vector s or matrix S consisting solely of pilot channel(s). In its simplest form, this<br>
consists of one pilot signal from one base station in the interference matrix S. The<br>
interference matrix may also include pilot signals from other base stations in the form of<br>
additional column vectors. The total number of pilot signals to be cancelled determine<br>
the rank of the interference matrix S.<br>
[294] For example, a rank 1 pilot only cancellation matrix is a [Nx1] vector containing<br>
one pilot signal. A multi-rank pilot only S matrix contains a pilot channel from <br>
different base stations or multipath in each column. The following equation describe<br>
the structure of a rank M pilot only S matrix for M base stations. Note that the pilo<br>
channel is channel zero.<br><br>
[296] This method requires no knowledge of the power of the pilot signals to be<br>
cancelled, of knowledge of the bits transmitted, symbol boundaries or limitations to the<br>
interference vector length.<br>
[297] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Pilot Only with Multipath<br>
[298] Pilot only cancellation may consist of either one base station or a plurality of<br>
base stations. Additionally, pilot only cancellation may include the multipath signals<br>
from one base station or a plurality of base stations. Without loss of generality, the<br>
following S matrix structure depicts an example of pilot only cancellation with<br>
multipath. This method does not have any limitations in terms of the length of the<br>
interference vectors.<br><br>
[300] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are<br>
provided to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the<br>
inventive concept is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Pilot and Paging<br>
[301] The pilot channel is typically the highest power channel for a given base station<br>
and is the obvious channel to cancel for maximum interference cancellation with<br>
minimal complexity. The rank of the S matrix is the primary determining factor in the<br>
computational requirements of the interference cancellation operation. For an increase<br>
in complexity and an increase in the amount of interference to cancel, one may cancel<br>
additional channels within the signal. The obvious choice after the pilot channel for<br>
cancellation is the paging channel since it is often the next strongest in terms of power<br>
followed in power by the traffic channels. The synchronization channel is a low data<br>
rate channel operating at a low power and may be lower in power than the active traffic<br>
channels. However, in scenarios of mobile units of varying distance from the base<br>
station the synchronization channel may be greater than the active channel.<br>
[302] The S matrix may be constructed of pilot and paging channels from an arbitrary<br>
number of base stations as long as the matrix includes only one Walsh symbol per<br>
interference vector. In practice, due to the alignment constraint, the cancellation matrix<br>
will typically include channels from only one finger. The following is a simple example<br>
of an S matrix for pilot and paging.<br><br>
[304] This example consists of the pilot and paging channels from e single finger from<br>
one base station.<br>
[305] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Other Multi-Rank<br>
[306] The choice of channels to cancel depends on the requirements of the<br>
communication device/system, but would likely consist of the highest relative amplitude<br>
channels since they comprise the majority of the interference in detecting other base<br>
stations. After pilot and paging, more complete cancellation may be achieved with other<br>
multi-rank methods that include a greater number of channels. The greatest amount of<br>
additional cancellation with the smallest marginal computational coit is cancellation of<br>
pilot, paging and the strongest traffic channels. The previously discussed signal<br>
amplitude determination modules may provide an estimate of the strongest traffic<br>
channels to allow for a ranking of the strongest channels. A threshold may be chosen,<br>
such that all traffic channels above the threshold are included in the construction of<br>
interference matrix S or instead a pre-determined number of traffic channels may be<br>
included in the construction of interference matrix S.<br>
[307] The S matrix may be constructed of pilot, paging, traffic and other channels from<br>
an arbitrary number of base stations. The following is a simple example of an S matrix<br>
for multi-rank cancellation.<br><br>
[309] This example consists of the pilot, paging and traffic channels from one base<br>
station.<br>
[310] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Full Rank<br>
[311] Full rank cancellation is computationally expensive, but provides virtually<br>
complete interference cancellation of all of one base station's channels without<br>
requiring knowledge of relative or absolute power. CdmaOne specifies 64 channels per<br>
base station including pilot, paging, synchronization and traffic, so the full rank<br>
cancellation procedure is of rank 64. In cdma2000 the number of channels greatly<br>
increases, including longer Walsh codes, supplementary Walsh codes and QOFs, so the<br>
rank may be much larger.<br>
[312] In cdmaOne the S matrix is constructed of all 64 channels. Without loss of<br>
generality, consider the cancellation of the LOS signal from base station one.<br><br>
[314] This S matrix may be augmented to include additional multipath signals or base<br>
stations. As previously noted, the number of interference vectors cannot exceed the<br>
rank of the matrix, i.e., the number of channels cannot exceed the segment length N.<br>
[315] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Knowledge of bits transmitted:<br>
[316] Using knowledge of bits transmitted increases the number of cancellation<br>
methods available that are not affected by symbol misalignment. Methods of<br>
cancellation include multi-rank cancellation of pilot and paging (typically the two<br>
strongest power channels), pilot and paging plus a subset of the strongest traffic<br>
channels and all channels (full rank).<br>
Pilot and Paging<br>
[317] The pilot channel is typically the highest power channel for a given base station<br>
and is the obvious channel to cancel for maximum interference cancellation with<br>
minimal complexity. The rank of the S matrix is the primary determining factor in the<br>
computational requirements of the interference cancellation operation. For an increase<br>
in complexity and an increase in the amount of interference to cancel, one may cancel<br>
additional channels within the signal. The obvious choice after the pilot channel for<br>
cancellation is the paging channel since it is often the next strongest in terms of power<br>
followed in power by the traffic channels. The synchronization channel is a low data<br>
rate channel operating at a low power and may be lower in power than the active traffic<br>
channels. However, in scenarios of mobile units of varying distance from the base<br>
station the synchronization channel may be greater than the active channels.<br>
[318] The S matrix may be constructed of pilot and paging channels from an arbitrary<br>
number of base stations. The following is a simple example of an S matrix for pilot and<br>
paging cancellation.<br><br>
[320] This example consists of the pilot and paging channels from a few base stations<br>
and a few multipaths. Note that it may be useful to only cancel the pilot channel tor<br>
some of the weaker signals (or multipath) as in the example above since canceling the<br>
other weaker channels may provide not much additional gain.<br>
[321] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Other Multi-Rank<br>
[322] The choice of channels to cancel depends on the requirements of the<br>
communication device/system, but would likely consist of the highest relative amplitude<br>
channels since they comprise the majority of the interference in detecting other base<br>
stations. After pilot and paging, more complete cancellation may be achieved with other<br>
multi-rank methods that include a greater number of channels. The greatest amount of<br>
additional cancellation with the smallest marginal computational cost is cancellation of<br>
pilot, paging and the strongest traffic channels. The previously discussed signal<br>
amplitude determination modules may provide an estimate of the strongest traffic<br>
channels to allow for a ranking of the strongest channels. A threshold may be chosen,<br>
such that all traffic channels above the threshold are included in the construction of<br>
interference matrix S or instead a pre-determined number of traffic channels may be<br>
included in the construction of interference matrix S.<br>
[323] The S matrix may be constructed of pilot, paging, traffic and other channels from<br>
an arbitrary number of base stations. The following is a simple example of an S matrix<br>
for multi-rank cancellation.<br><br>
[325] This example consists of the pilot, paging and active traffic channels from a few<br>
base stations with multipath.<br>
[326] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples arc provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Full Rank<br>
[327] Full rank cancellation is computationally expensive, but provides virtually<br>
complete interference cancellation of all of one base station's channels without<br>
requiring knowledge of relative or absolute power. CdmaOne specifies 64 channels per<br>
base station including pilot, paging, synchronization and traffic, so the full rank<br>
cancellation procedure is of rank 64. In cdma2000 the number of channels greatly<br>
increases, including longer Walsh codes, supplementary Walsh codes and QOFs, so the<br>
rank may be much larger.<br>
[328] In cdmaOne the S matrix is constructed of all 64 channels. Without loss of<br>
generality, consider the cancellation of the LOS signal from base station one.<br><br>
[330] This S matrix may be augmented to include additional multipath signals or base<br>
stations. As previously noted, the number of interference vectors cannot exceed the<br>
rank of the matrix.<br>
[331] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Use of knowledge of relative signal amplitude<br>
[332] If the mobile knows the relative power of some or all of the channels through the<br>
use of the relative signal amplitude modules, it may perform cancellation through the<br>
use of the composite method. The CSPE may linearly combine the columns<br>
(interference vectors) of the interference matrix S scaling with the relative signal<br>
amplitudes, into a single vector, referred to as a composite vector. Also, the relative<br>
signal amplitude information may be used lo scale the vectors and to build a multi-rank<br>
interference matrix. Scaling each column of S with its known relative signal weight and<br>
adding them together accomplishes the linear combination as disclosed in the composite<br>
method. This produces a composite vector that points in the direction corresponding to<br>
the superposition of multiple interference vectors. Suppose the relative weights of all<br>
the channels are known, one may then combine the 64 columns of S in a cdmaOne<br>
system into a single vector or some other desired combination of composite vectors.<br>
Similarly, the interference vectors corresponding to multipath components may be<br>
similarly combined using the relative weights into a single vector or into a plurality of<br>
composite vectors.<br>
[333] Clearly, it is not necessary to include all the Walsh channels when constructing<br>
the interference subspace vector for a given base station's multipath signal. For<br>
example, some of the Walsh codes may not be in use or resolve so little power that they<br>
are not a significant contributor to the interference. A decision to include or exclude a<br>
particular channel may be made by examining the associated power resolved by that<br>
channel. If a channel is to be excluded from the interference space, then the power of<br>
that Walsh channel may be set to zero in the construction process or simply ignored.<br>
This operation will result in that channel being excluded from the construction of the<br>
composite interference vector. For example, one may decide to only include the pilot<br>
and paging channels, or just the pilot or a subset of channels, such as the strongest<br>
traffic channels, for construction of the interference matrix S.<br>
[334] The power assigned to each channel is set at the base-station by the power<br>
control and the relative power between the channels does not change from the<br>
transmission to when the signal is received at the mobile. While the power loss depends<br>
on the signal path as the multipath signals reflect off objects in its path, the relative<br>
power between channels remains constant. CSPE may use relative signal amplitude<br>
information because the projection operation is independent of the absolute power of the<br>
channels, reliant instead on direction within the multi-dimensional signal sub-space.<br>
The ability to use relative power is a feature of CSPE that is not provided for in<br>
competing techniques that rely on successive subtraction of interfering signals using<br>
absolute power estimation.<br>
[335] Clearly, if the QOF channels or supplementary channels are being used, then the<br>
power resolved on those channels must also be computed. A Fas: Walsh Transform<br>
(FWT) may be useful for the latter. However, this time, the cross-correlations have to<br>
be accounted for, through the inverse of the Grammian matrix built from all the codes,<br>
i.e., STS. Recall that the QOFs are not orthogonal between QOF families or QOF<br>
families and the Walsh code set. Once the powers are estimated, they are used to build<br>
the interference space as described above.<br>
Composite<br>
[336] The composite method is unique to the other methods previously discussed since<br>
there is not a direct correlation between the rank and the number of interfering channels<br>
that are effectively cancelled. It is very efficient computationally in terms of the amount<br>
of interference it may cancel, but it does require accurate estimation of the relative<br>
signal amplitude between the channels. The composite method may be used to cancel<br>
all of the channels in one base station, multiple base stations or only a subset of the total<br>
number of channels, typically the channels with the greatest amplitude. Each column of<br>
the S matrix may be composed of one or more base stations' channels. A simple<br>
example of a composite interference matrix for all channels (0-63) in a LOS signal is<br><br>
[338] where the subscript denotes that the vector s is the summation of the 64 channels<br>
from one base station. Namely,<br><br>
[340] where all channels are summed with the relative amplitude R to form a<br>
composite vector. In addition, it is possible to form a composite S from more than one<br>
base station.<br><br>
[342] where s is composed of the LOS channels 0 through 63 of base station one and<br>
the LOS channels 0 through 33 of base station two. Moreover, multi-rank composite<br>
interference matrices may be formed.<br><br>
[344] where each column of the interference matrix may be itself a composite. The<br>
complexity of the composite is limited by the ability of the mobile unit to accurately<br>
determine the relative powers between the received channels.<br>
[345] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Multipath Composite<br>
[346] The composite method may be extended to include multipath in much the same<br>
way as a plurality of multiple base stations may be integrated into a composite. For<br>
example, a composite interference matrix composed of a LOS signal and the first two<br>
multipath signals for channels 0-33 may be given as<br><br>
[348] As in the previous composite example, more complicated composite interference<br>
matrices with multipath may be constructed.<br><br>
[350] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Permutations of Other Methods<br>
[351] The generation of interference matrices may be extended to include<br>
combinations of the aforementioned methods. For example, a composite signal for one<br>
base station may be combined with the pilot and paging channels of a second base<br>
station's line of sight signal using knowledge of the bits transmitted and the strongest<br>
multipath of the third base station's pilot signal to form a rank 3 S matrix.<br><br>
[353] The complexity of the interference matrices generated is limited by the time and<br>
computational requirements set forth by the processing capabilities of the mobile unit.<br>
[354] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
[355] A number of techniques have been studied for combining signals for improved<br>
performance. Some of the techniques include Maximal Ratio Combiner, Ratio-squared<br>
Combiner, Post-detection Combiner, Pre-detection Combiner, Selective Combiner and<br>
the Rake Receiver. The key idea behind these techniques is to combine the signals from<br>
a plurality of channels after scaling the signal in each channel by a quantity that is<br>
proportional to the power of that signal, i.e., ensuring that stronger signals are weighted<br>
more heavily in the sum, and inversely proportional to the power of the noise in that<br>
channel.<br>
[356] The method of the present invention involves canceling ail those signals that<br>
might create interference (pilot, service channels, data channels and all their multipath<br>
signals) prior to performing the combining. The architecture discussed in this<br>
application accomplishes this via interference cancellation.<br>
cdma2000<br>
[357] Additional modifications have to be made to accommodate features and<br>
enhancements made to CDMA2000. Quasi-orthogonal (QOF) and concatenated<br>
functions may be used after exhausting the Walsh family of orthogonal codes available<br>
for traffic channels. Variable length supplementary Walsh codes are also used to attain<br>
higher data rates. Specifically, shorter Walsh codes down to 4 chips in length are used<br>
to increase the data rate. The limitation on Walsh codes is a length limit of 128 for 1X<br>
rates and 256 for 3X rates, except for the auxiliary pilot and auxiliary transmit diversity<br>
pilot channels.<br>
[358] Due to the varying lengths of the Walsh codes, it will become increasingly<br>
important to have bit or relative amplitude information to facilitate interference<br>
cancellation. If the interference matrix contains non-pilot interference vectors<br>
composed of different length Walsh codes, it becomes imperative that the vectors of<br>
shorter length Walsh codes use either bit or relative amplitude information in order to<br>
correctly cancel interference. For information bearing channels it is necessary for no<br>
Walsh symbol boundaries to appear in the interference matrix if bit or relative amplitude<br>
information is not used. The benefit of canceling over one Walsh symbol is that it is not<br>
necessary to know bit or relative amplitude information. However, it may not be<br>
feasible to cancel interference over only 4 chip symbols since a longer data record may<br>
provide better cancellation properties.<br>
[359] Correlation will have to be accounted for when a mix of QOPs and variable<br>
length Walsh codes are used for channelization. While the goal is to minimize the<br>
correlation between QOFs and variable length Walsh codes, the codes are truly not<br>
orthogonal and there is a nonzero correlation. Even with perfect time alignment QOFs<br>
are not orthogonal to the original Walsh code set. Within a QOF set, orthogonality is<br>
preserved, but there is a correlation between code vectors from different sets. A critical<br>
difference is that when QOFs are used, channels within the same finger may no longer<br>
be orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the present invention may be applied to<br>
cancellation of channels within a single finger.<br>
[360] For example, to acquire, track and demodulate an arbitrary channel, for example,<br>
channel 25, in a finger that uses Walsh codes and QOFs it may be necessary to cancel all<br>
channels with a non-zero correlation. Without loss of generality, consider the channels<br>
with nonzero correlation relative to channel 25 to be channels 1-10 and 32. The<br>
following interference matrix S may be constructed for a LOS finger:<br><br>
[362] Depending on variable length Walsh codes and the interference vector length it<br>
may be necessary to use bit or relative amplitude information when constructing the<br>
interference matrix.<br>
[363] It should be appreciated that the above-identified specific examples are provided<br>
to illustrate the concepts of constructing the interference matrix S, the inventive concept<br>
is not limited to the specific example.<br>
Relative power through the standards committee<br>
[364] An alternative method for relaying the relative powers (which are very<br>
accurately known at the base-station), which is not in the current standards, is to have<br>
the base-station broadcast the relative powers through the broadcast channel or some<br>
other channel. The mobile may receive this information from the appropriate channel<br>
and build the most accurate interference subspace vector possible. The mobile may build<br>
the matrix S with these vectors and then proceed to cancel the interference.<br>
Interference Invariant Diversity Combining<br>
[365] A number of techniques have been studied for combining signals for improved<br>
performance. Some of the techniques include Maximal Ratio Combiner, Ratio-squared<br>
Combiner, Post-detection Combiner, Pre-detection Combiner, Selective Combiner and<br>
the Rake Receiver. The key idea behind these techniques is to combine the signals from<br>
multiple channels after scaling the signal in each channel by a quantity that is<br>
proportional to the amplitude of that signal, i.e., ensuring that stronger signals are<br>
weighted more heavily in the sum, and inversely proportional to the amplitude of the<br>
noise in that channel.<br>
[366] The approach of the present invention involves canceling all those signals that<br>
might create interference (pilot, paging, synchronization, traffic channels, data channels,<br>
all other channels and their multipath copies) prior to performing the raking. The<br>
architecture discussed here accomplishes this interference cancellation.<br>

preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be<br>
understood that various changes and modifications may be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the<br>
