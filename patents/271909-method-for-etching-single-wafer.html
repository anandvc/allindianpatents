				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR ETCHING SINGLE WAFER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method for<br>
etching the front surface of a wafer one by one, where the<br>
wafer is rotated while an etching solution is supplied onto<br>
the front surface of the wafer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] In general, the process for manufacturing a<br>
semiconductor wafer comprises the steps of obtaining wafers<br>
by cutting and slicing out of a single crystal ingot, and<br>
chamfering the respective wafers, mechanical grinding<br>
(lapping) , etching, mirror-polishing, and cleaning, thereby<br>
producing a wafer with highly precise flatness. The wafer,<br>
which has been subjected to the steps for mechanical<br>
processing, such as block-cutting, rounding, slicing, and<br>
lapping, has a damaged layer (i.e., a processing-strained<br>
layer) on the surface thereof. In the process for device<br>
production, such a processing-strained layer causes crystal<br>
defects, such as slip dislocation, and the mechanical<br>
strength of the wafer is then decreased. In addition, it<br>
has adverse effects on electric characteristics. Therefore,<br>
the processing-strained layer should be completely removed.<br>
For removing such a processing-strained layer, an etching<br><br><br>
process is carried out. There are two types of etching:<br>
dip-etching and single wafer etching.<br>
[0003] Among the etching processes, the single wafer<br>
etching has been regarded as the most suitable etching<br>
process, which enables the control of the texture-size and<br>
surface roughness of a large-sized wafer. The single wafer<br>
etching is a process comprising dropping an etching<br>
solution onto the front surface of a flattened single wafer<br>
and horizontally rotating (spinning) the wafer to spread<br>
out the dripped etching solution over the front surface of<br>
the wafer. The etching solution supplied on the wafer is<br>
spread out over the surface of the wafer from a supplied<br>
point by centrifugal force caused by horizontally spinning<br>
the wafer, and finally reaches the edge of the wafer, so<br>
that the edge of the wafer as well as the front surface<br>
thereof can be also etched at the same time. Furthermore,<br>
most of the etching solution supplied is blown off from the<br>
edge thereof by centrifugal force and then collected into a<br>
cup or the like arranged on an etching device.<br>
[0004] For example, as a process for manufacturing a<br>
semiconductor wafer that can effectively remove a<br>
processing-strained layer caused by mechanical grinding and<br>
retain the flatness of the wafer, there is disclosed one<br>
including the following steps; slicing a silicon single<br>
crystal ingot; chamfering the end face of the sliced wafer;<br>
flattening at least the front surface thereof obtained by<br>
slicing the semiconductor ingot by means of surface<br><br><br>
grinding or lapping; spin-etching the flattened front<br>
surface of the wafer; and polishing the etched front<br>
surface of the wafer into a mirror surface (e.g., see<br>
Patent Document 1).<br>
[0005] Patent Document 1<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<br>
11-135464 (Claim 1, FIG. 1)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] However, in the single wafer etching shown in<br>
the Patent Document 1, the etching solution is<br>
quantitatively dripped through a single supply nozzle, so<br>
that etching amount may vary. As a result, the front and<br>
back surfaces of a silicon wafer, subjected to the etching<br>
process, have deficiencies that the flatness of the wafer<br>
cannot be maintained after the flattening process including<br>
lapping and grinding. In addition, the desired surface<br>
roughness of the wafer cannot be obtained. Therefore, for<br>
improving the flatness and surface roughness thereof, a<br>
large amount of grinding margin is required in the mirror<br>
polishing process, so that the subsequent steps in mirror<br>
polishing will bear a heavy burden.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a method for etching a single wafer,<br>
which can effectively attain high flatness and improve the<br>
productivity thereof.<br><br><br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM<br>
[0008] As shown in FIG. 1, the invention of claim 1 is<br>
an improvement of a method for etching a single wafer,<br>
wherein a single thin disk-like silicon wafer 11 sliced<br>
from a silicon single crystal ingot is spun to etch a front<br>
surface of the wafer 11 with etching solutions 21, 22<br>
supplied thereto.<br>
[0009] The characteristic feature thereof lies in that<br>
a plurality of etching solution supply nozzles 31, 32 are<br>
disposed above and opposite to the front surface of the<br>
wafer 11 at different portions in the radial direction of<br>
the wafer, respectively and one or more conditions selected<br>
from the group consisting of temperatures, kinds, and<br>
supply flow rates of etching solutions 21, 22 from the<br>
plurality of supply nozzles 31, 32 are then changed.<br>
[0010] In the single wafer etching apparatus as<br>
described in claim 1, plural etching solution supply<br>
nozzles 31, 32 are disposed above and opposite to the front<br>
surface of the wafer 11 at different portions in the radial<br>
direction of the wafer, respectively. From these etching<br>
solution supply nozzles 31, 32, optimum etching solutions<br>
21, 22, where the temperature, kind, and supply flow rate<br>
are adjusted depending on the surface shape of the wafer 11,<br>
are supplied to the respective portions described above.<br>
Therefore, the degree of freedom to control the<br>
distribution of etching amount on the surface of the wafer<br><br><br>
11 in the wafer surface can be increased and the wafer 11<br>
can be thus effectively provided with high flatness.<br>
[0011] The invention of claim 2 is related to the<br>
invention of claim 1, as further shown in Fig. 1, wherein<br>
the plurality of etching solution supply nozzles 31, 32<br>
include a first supply nozzle 31 that supplies a first<br>
etching solution 21 to the center of the front surface of<br>
the wafer 11 and a second supply nozzle 32 that supplies a<br>
second etching solution 22 to the periphery of the front<br>
surface of the wafer 11, wherein the temperature of the<br>
first etching solution 21 supplied from the first supply<br>
nozzle 31 to the center of the front surface of the wafer<br>
11 is higher than the temperature of the second etching<br>
solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle 32 to<br>
the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11.<br>
[0012] In the method for etching a single wafer as<br>
described in claim 2, the temperature of the first etching<br>
solution supplied on the center of the front surface of the<br>
wafer is higher than the temperature of the second etching<br>
solution supplied to the periphery of the front surface of<br>
the wafer, so that the rate of etching the wafer with the<br>
first etching solution can be higher than the rate of<br>
etching the wafer with the second solution. Typically, in<br>
the method for etching a single wafer, due to both the<br>
generation of heat by reaction and the transfer of a liquid<br>
in the peripheral direction of the wafer by centrifugal<br>
force, excessive etching may tend to occur in the periphery.<br><br><br>
However, in the method for etching a single wafer of the<br>
present invention, the temperature of the first etching<br>
solution 21 supplied from the first supply nozzle 31 to the<br>
center of the front surface of the wafer 11 is higher than<br>
the temperature of the second etching solution 22 supplied<br>
from the second supply nozzle 32 to the periphery of the<br>
front surface of the wafer 11, so that the periphery of the<br>
wafer 11 can be prevented from excessive etching.<br>
Therefore, the wafer 11 can be effectively provided with<br>
high flatness.<br>
[0013] The invention of claim 3 is related to the<br>
invention of claim 1, as shown in FIG. 1, wherein the<br>
plurality of etching solution supply nozzles 31, 32 include<br>
a first supply nozzle 31 that supplies a first etching<br>
solution 21 to the center of the front surface of the wafer<br>
11 and a second supply nozzle 32 that supplies a second<br>
etching solution 22 to the periphery of the front surface<br>
of the wafer 11, where the first etching solution 21<br>
supplied from the first supply nozzle 31 to the center of<br>
the front surface of the wafer 11 is an etching solution<br>
having a higher etching rate than that of the second<br>
etching solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle<br>
32 to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11.<br>
[0014] In the method for etching a single wafer as<br>
described in claim 3, the first etching solution 21<br>
supplied from the first supply nozzle 31 to the center of<br>
the front surface of the wafer 11 is an etching solution<br><br><br>
having a higher etching rate than that of the second<br>
etching solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle<br>
32 to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11,<br>
so that the etching rate of the wafer with the first<br>
etching solution can be higher than the etching rate of the<br>
wafer with second etching solution. Typically, in the<br>
method for etching a single wafer, due to both the<br>
generation of heat by reaction and the transfer of a liquid<br>
in the peripheral direction of the wafer by centrifugal<br>
force, excessive etching may tend to occur in the periphery.<br>
However, in the method for etching a single wafer of the<br>
present invention, the first etching solution 21 supplied<br>
from the first supply nozzle 31 to the center of the front<br>
surface of the wafer 11 uses the kind of an etching<br>
solution having an etching rate higher than that of the<br>
second etching solution 22 supplied from the second supply<br>
nozzle 32 to the periphery of the front surface of the<br>
wafer 11, so that the periphery of the wafer 11 can be<br>
prevented from excessive etching. Therefore, the wafer 11<br>
can be effectively provided with high flatness.<br>
[0015] The invention of claim 4 is related to the<br>
invention of claim 1, as further shown in FIG. 1, wherein<br>
the plurality of etching solution supply nozzles 31, 32<br>
include a first supply nozzle 31 that supplies a first<br>
etching solution 21 to the center of the front surface of<br>
the wafer 11 and a second supply nozzle 32 that supplies a<br>
second etching solution 22 to the periphery of the front<br><br><br>
surface of the wafer 11, where the supply flow rate of the<br>
first etching solution 21 supplied from the first supply<br>
nozzle 31 to the center of the front surface of the wafer<br>
11 is higher than the supply flow rate of the second<br>
etching solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle<br>
32 to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11.<br>
[0016] In the method for etching a single wafer as<br>
described in claim 4, the supply flow rate of the first<br>
etching solution 21 supplied from the first supply nozzle<br>
31 to the center of the front surface of the wafer 11 is<br>
higher than the supply flow rate of the second etching<br>
solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle 32 to<br>
the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11, so that<br>
the etching rate of the wafer with the first etching<br>
solution can be higher than the etching rate of the wafer<br>
with the second etching solution. Typically, in the method<br>
for etching a single wafer, due to both the generation of<br>
heat by reaction and the transfer of a liquid in the<br>
peripheral direction of the wafer by centrifugal force,<br>
excessive etching may tend to occur in the periphery.<br>
However, in the method for etching a single wafer of the<br>
present invention, the supply flow rate of the first<br>
etching solution 21 supplied from the first supply nozzle<br>
31 to the center of the front surface of the wafer 11 is<br>
higher than the supply flow rate of the second etching<br>
solution 22 supplied from the second supply nozzle 32 to<br>
the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11, so that<br><br>
the periphery of the wafer 11 can be prevented from<br>
excessive etching. Therefore, the wafer 11 can be<br>
effectively provided with high flatness.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] As described above, according to the present<br>
invention, a plurality of etching solution supply nozzles<br>
are disposed above and opposite to the front surface of the<br>
wafer at different portions in the radial direction of the<br>
wafer, respectively and one or more conditions selected<br>
from the group consisting of temperatures, kinds, and<br>
supply flow rates of etching solutions from the plurality<br>
of etching solution supply nozzles are then changed.<br>
Therefore, an optimum etching solution, where the<br>
temperature, kind, or supply flow rate thereof are adjusted,<br>
is supplied, to each part of the wafer from the plurality of<br>
etching solution supply nozzles. As a result, the degree<br>
of freedom to control the distribution of etching amount on<br>
the surface of the wafer can be increased and the wafer can<br>
be effectively provided with high flatness, thereby<br>
allowing the wafer to be easily subjected to the subsequent<br>
step of grinding.<br>
[0018] In addition, the temperature of the first<br>
etching solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to<br>
the center of the front surface of the wafer is higher than<br>
the temperature of the second etching solution supplied<br>
from the second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front<br><br><br>
surface of the wafer, so that the etching rate of the wafer<br>
with the first etching solution can be higher than the<br>
etching rate of the wafer with the second etching solution.<br>
As a result,, the excessive etching of the periphery of the<br>
wafer can be repaired, thereby efficiently providing the<br>
wafer with high flatness.<br>
[0019] In addition, an etching solution used as the<br>
first etching solution supplied from the first supply<br>
nozzle to the center of the front surface of the wafer has<br>
a higher etching rate than that of the second etching<br>
solution supplied from the second supply nozzle to the<br>
periphery of the front surface of the wafer, so that the<br>
etching rate of the wafer with the first etching solution<br>
can be higher than the etching rate of the wafer with the<br>
second etching solution. As a result, the excessive<br>
etching of the periphery of the wafer can be repaired,<br>
thereby efficiently providing the wafer with high flatness.<br>
[0020] Furthermore, the supply flow rate of the first<br>
etching solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to<br>
the center of the front surface of the wafer is higher than<br>
that of the second etching solution supplied from the<br>
second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front surface<br>
of the wafer, so that the etching rate of the wafer with<br>
the first etching solution can be higher than the etching<br>
rate of the wafer with the second etching solution. As a<br>
result, the excessive etching of the periphery of the wafer<br>
can be repaired, thereby efficiently providing the wafer<br><br><br>
with high flatness.<br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
[0022] Hereinafter, preferred embodiments for carrying<br>
out the present invention will be described in more details<br>
with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
[0023] As shown in FIG. 1, a silicon single wafer<br>
etching apparatus 10 comprises a wafer chuck 12 housed in a<br>
chamber, on which a thin disk-like silicon wafer 11 is<br>
mounted and retained horizontally. The wafer chuck 12<br>
comprises a disk-like base member 13 having a diameter<br>
larger than that of the wafer 11 and a holding axis 16 in<br>
which an axial part 16a is inserted through a through hole<br>
13a formed in the center of the base member 13 and extended<br>
in the vertical direction. The holding axis 16 comprises<br>
the axial part 16a; a wafer-receiving part 16b having a<br>
large diameter, which is integrally formed with the axial<br>
part 16a and arranged on the front surface of the axial<br>
part 16a; a through hole 16c, which is formed in the center<br>
of the holding axis 16 and extends from the bottom face to<br>
the top of the holding axis 16 in the vertical direction; a<br>
plurality of communicating holes 16d each having an end<br>
communicating with the upper end of the through hole 16c<br>
and an opposite closed end, where the communicating holes<br>
16d radiate outward around the through hole 16c in the<br>
radial direction of the wafer-receiving part 16b; a<br>
plurality of ring grooves 16e concentrically formed in the<br>
front surface of the wafer-receiving part 16b; and a<br>
plurality of small pores 16f allowing the communicating<br>
holes 16d and the ring grooves 16e to communicate with each<br><br><br>
other. A vacuum pump (not shown) is connected and<br>
communicated with the bottom end of the through hole 16c.<br>
The front surface of the wafer-receiving part 16b is<br>
configured to mount the wafer 11 concentrically with the<br>
wafer-receiving part 16b. Then, when the vacuum pump is<br>
driven to make the inner pressure of the through hole 16c<br>
negative, the negative pressure in the through hole 16c<br>
allows the rear surface of the wafer 11 to be adsorbed onto<br>
the wafer-receiving part 16b to retain the wafer 11<br>
horizontally. In addition, the silicon single wafer<br>
etching apparatus 10 comprises a spinning device 17 for<br>
spinning the wafer 11 around the vertical axis thereof in a<br>
horizontal plane. The spinning device 17 comprises the<br>
holding axis 16, a driving motor (not shown) for rotating<br>
the holding axis 16. It is configured that the driving<br>
motor rotates the holding axis 16 to allow the wafer 11<br>
retained on the holding axis 16 to be spun with the holding<br>
axis 16. Alternatively, it may be configured that when the<br>
driving motor rotates the holding axis, the wafer is spun<br>
with the holding axis while the base member is being fixed<br>
without spinning.<br>
[0024] In addition, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a<br>
plurality of supply nozzles 31, 32 are disposed above and<br>
opposite to the front surface of the wafer 11 at different<br>
positions in the radial direction of the wafer 11,<br>
respectively. In this embodiment, the plurality of the<br>
supply nozzles 31, 32 include a first supply nozzle 31 that<br><br><br>
supplies a first etching solution 21 to the center of the<br>
front surface of the wafer 11 and a second supply nozzle 32<br>
that supplies a second etching solution 22 to the periphery<br>
of the front surface of the wafer 11. These supply nozzles<br>
31, 32 can be independently moved, respectively by nozzle-<br>
moving devices 41, 42 disposed separately. The first<br>
nozzle-moving device 41 for moving the first supply nozzle<br>
31 comprises: a rotary motor 41a that directly moves the<br>
first supply nozzle 31 in the axial direction; a ball screw<br>
41c coaxially connected to a rotary axis 41b of the rotary<br>
motor 41a; and a female screw member 41d for holding the<br>
first supply nozzle 31 in which a female screw that can be<br>
screwed by the ball screw 41c is formed. By allowing the<br>
ball screw 41c to rotate by rotating the rotational axis<br>
41b of the rotary motor 41a, the first supply nozzle 31 can<br>
be directly moved in the axial direction thereof together<br>
with the female screw member 41d. In addition, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2 in detail, the first supply nozzle is<br>
configured that it can oscillate between a first evacuation<br>
position (i.e., a position represented by a two-dot chain<br>
line in FIG. 2) where a fist discharge opening 31a does not<br>
face to the front surface of the wafer 11 and a first<br>
liquid supplying position (i.e., a position represented by<br>
a solid line) where the first discharge opening 31a faces<br>
to the center of the front surface of the wafer 11, due to<br>
the first nozzle-moving device 41. On the other hand, the<br>
second nozzle-moving device 42 that moves the second supply<br><br><br>
nozzle 32 is mounted on the base end of the second supply<br>
nozzle 32 and is provided with a stepping motor 42a that<br>
allows the tip of the second supply nozzle 32 to oscillate<br>
around the base end. Furthermore, the second supply nozzle<br>
32 is configured that it can oscillate between a second<br>
evacuation position (i.e., a position represented by a two-<br>
dot chain line in FIG. 2) where the second discharge<br>
opening 32a does not face to the front surface of the wafer<br>
11 and a second liquid supplying position (i.e., a position<br>
represented by a solid line) where the second discharge<br>
opening 32a faces to the periphery of the front surface of<br>
the wafer 11, due to the second nozzle-moving device 42.<br>
Here, the periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11,<br>
where the second discharge opening 32a is positioned on the<br>
second liquid supplying position, is a given distance<br>
within the range of (0.8 to 1.0)D/2 from the center of the<br>
wafer 11 to the edge thereof, when the outer diameter of<br>
the wafer 11 is D.<br>
[0025] Referring again to FIG. 1, the first supply<br>
nozzle 31 is connected to an etching solution supplying<br>
device 51 that discharges the first etching solution 21<br>
from the first discharge opening 31a to the center of the<br>
front surface of the wafer 11. In contrast, the second<br>
supply nozzle 32 is connected to a second etching solution<br>
supplying device 52 that discharges the second etching<br>
solution 22 from the second discharge opening 32a to the<br>
center of the front surface of the wafer 11. The first<br><br><br>
etching solution supplying device 51 comprises a first tank<br>
51a for reserving the first etching solution 21, a first<br>
conduit line 51b that allows the first tank 51a to connect<br>
to and communicate with the base end of the first supply<br>
nozzle 31, a first pump 51c for supplying the first etching<br>
solution 21 from the first tank 51a mounted on the first<br>
conduit line 51b to the first supply nozzle 31, and a first<br>
flow control valve 51d for adjusting the supply flow rate<br>
of the first etching solution 21 to the first supply nozzle<br>
31 mounted on the first conduit line 51b. The first tank<br>
51a is provided with a first temperature controller (not<br>
shown) that is capable of controlling the temperature of<br>
the first etching solution 21 in the tank 51a. Here, the<br>
reference numeral 51e in FIG. 1 is a first return tube for<br>
returning a surplus amount of the first etching solution 21<br>
supplied by the first pump 51a to the first tank 51a. In<br>
contrast, the second etching solution supplying device 52<br>
comprises a second tank 52a for reserving the second<br>
etching solution 22, a second conduit line 52b for allowing<br>
the second tank 52a to connect to and communicate with the<br>
base end of the second supply nozzle 32, a second pump 52c<br>
for supplying the second etching solution 22 from the<br>
second tank 52a mounted on the second conduit line 52b to<br>
the second supply nozzle, and a second flow control valve<br>
52d for adjusting the supply flow rate of the second<br>
etching solution 22 to the second supply nozzle 32 mounted<br>
on the second conduit line 52b. Here, the reference<br><br><br>
numeral 52e in FIG. 1 is a second return tube for returning<br>
a surplus amount of the second etching solution 22 supplied<br>
by the second pump 52a to the first tank 51a.<br>
[0026] One or more selected from the groups consisting<br>
of temperature, kind, and supply flow rate of each of the<br>
first and second etching solutions 21, 22 can be changed.<br>
When the temperatures of the first and second etching<br>
solution 21, 22 are changed, the first etching solution 21<br>
is adjusted to a predetermined temperature of preferably in<br>
the range of 15 to 40°C, more preferably in the range of 15<br>
to 30°C by the first temperature controller and the second<br>
etching solution 22 is adjusted to a predetermined<br>
temperature lower than that of the first etching solution<br>
21, preferably in the range of 0 to 30°C, more preferably<br>
in the range of 5 to 20°C. Here, the reason of why the<br>
temperature of the first etching solution 21 is limited in<br>
the range of 15 to 40°C is that less than 15°C leads to a<br>
decrease in productivity as the etching rate of a main part<br>
of the wafer surface lowers and more than 40°C leads to<br>
difficulty in maintenance of the degree of wafer flatness<br>
as the viscosity of the etching solution decreases. The<br>
reason of why the temperature of the etching solution 22 is<br>
limited in the range of 0 to 30°C is that less than 0°C<br>
leads to coagulation of the etching solution and more than<br>
30 °C leads to insufficient effects because of a decrease<br>
in difference of the etching rates with the first etching<br>
solution.<br><br><br>
[0027] furthermore, when each of the kinds of the<br>
first and second etching solution 21, 22 is changed, the<br>
first etching solution 21 used is one preferably having an<br>
etching rate of 0.2 to 3 urn/sec, more preferably 0.3 to 1<br>
m/sec at 30°C and the second etching solution 22 used is<br>
one having an etching rate smaller than the first etching<br>
solution, preferably 0.01 to 1 um/sec, more preferably 0.01<br>
to 0.3 um/sec. Here, the reason of why the etching rate of<br>
the first etching solution 21 is limited in the range of<br>
0.2 to 3 m /sec is that less than 0.2 m/sec leads to a<br>
reduction in productivity and more than 3 m leads to a<br>
difficulty in control of the shape of wafer because of<br>
being obstructive to the progress of etching as a matter of<br>
practice. The reason of why the etching rate of the second<br>
etching solution 22 is limited in the range of 0.01 to 1<br>
m/sec is that less than 0.01 m/sec leads to being<br>
virtually incapable of processing etching and controlling<br>
wafer forming and more than 1 m/sec leads to insufficient<br>
effects because of a decrease in difference of the etching<br>
rates with the first etching solution. The above first<br>
etching solution 21 may be one having a weight ratio (% by<br>
weight) of fluorinated acid (HF) : nitric acid (HNO3) :<br>
phosphate (H3PO4) : water (H2O) = (5 to 20) : (5 to 40) :<br>
(30 to 40) : remainder (rest) after mixing with an aqueous<br>
acid solution. The second etching solution 22 may be one<br>
having a weight ratio (% by weight) of fluorinated acid<br>
(HF) : nitric acid (HNO3) : phosphate (H3PO4) : water (H2O)<br><br><br>
= (0.5 to 10) : (20 to 50) : (30 to 40) : remainder (rest).<br>
[0028] Furthermore, when the supply flow rate of each<br>
of the first and second etching solutions 21, 22 is changed,<br>
the supply flow rate of the first etching solution 21 is<br>
adjusted to preferably 1 to 10 1/min, more preferably 2 to<br>
5 1/min. The supply flow rate of the second etching<br>
solution 22 is adjusted to one smaller than the supply flow<br>
rate, and preferably 0.1 to 5 1/min, more preferably 0.5 to<br>
3 1/min. Here, the reason of why the supply flow rate of<br>
the first etching solution 21 is limited within the range<br>
of 1 to 10 1/min is that less than 1 1/min leads to being<br>
obstructive to the progress of etching and more than 10<br>
1/min leads to a decrease in effect to plant costs because<br>
of enlargement of facilities. The reason of why the supply<br>
flow rate of the second etching solution 22 is limited<br>
within the range of 0.1 to 51/min is that less than 0.1<br>
1/min leads to offset of the effects of the second etching<br>
solution 22 and more than 51/m leads to unstable liquid<br>
conditions because of an increase in liquid interference.<br>
[0029] Further, the single wafer etching apparatus 10<br>
has a detecting device 39 for detecting irregularities of<br>
the surface of the wafer 11, by a laser reflection scheme<br>
utilizing laser reflection at the surface of the wafer 11.<br>
The detecting device 39 has a detection output connected to<br>
a control input of the control device 35, and the control<br>
device 35 has a control output connected to the driving<br>
motor (not shown) of the spinning device 17, to the first<br><br><br>
pump 51c and first flow control valve 51d of the etching<br>
solution supplying device 51, to the second pump 52c and<br>
second flow control valve 52d of the second etching<br>
solution supplying device 52, to the rotary motor 41a of<br>
the first nozzle-moving device 41, and to the stepping<br>
motor 42a of the second nozzle-moving device 42. The<br>
control device 35 is configured, based on the detection<br>
output of the detecting device 39, to control the<br>
rotational speed of the driving motor of the spinning<br>
device 17, thereby setting the rotational speed of the<br>
wafer 11; to control the first pump 51c and first flow<br>
control valve 51d of the etching solution supplying device<br>
51 and the second pump 52c and second flow control valve<br>
52d of the second etching solution supplying device 52,<br>
thereby determining supplying states of etching solutions<br>
from the first and second supply nozzles 31, 32; and to<br>
control the rotary motor 41a of the first nozzle-moving<br>
device 41 and the stepping motor 42a of the second nozzle-<br>
moving device 42, thereby setting the states and positions<br>
of the first and second supply nozzles 31, 32, respectively.<br>
Concretely, the control device 35 has a calculation device<br>
36 such as a CPU, and a plurality of memories 37, 38,<br>
The plurality of memories 37, 38, ••• store therein, at<br>
least, the surface shape of the wafer 11 before processing,<br>
the positions of the first and second supply nozzles 31, 32,<br>
the amounts of the etching solutions discharged from the<br>
first and second supply nozzles 31, 32, the etched state of<br><br><br>
the surface of the wafer 11 during the processing, a<br>
reference shape of the wafer 11 after the processing,<br>
respectively. The calculation device 36 is configured to<br>
conduct calculations based on the wafer surface shape,<br>
nozzle positions, and the like stored in the memories 37,<br>
38, •••, thereby obtaining movements of the nozzles 31, 32<br>
and the discharging states of the etching solutions.<br>
Further, the memories 37, 38, ••• store therein data of the<br>
surface shape of the wafer 11 before processing detected by<br>
the detecting device 39. Note that it is possible for the<br>
memories 37, 38, •••: to store data of a surface shape of<br>
each wafer 11 to be processed, which data is detected by<br>
the detecting device 39; to store data of a surface shape<br>
of one wafer 11 every predetermined number of wafers 11,<br>
which data is representatively detected by the detecting<br>
device 39; or to store data of a surface shape of a<br>
predetermined wafer 11 every ingot, which data is<br>
representatively detected by the detecting device 39; or,<br>
it is possible to use a predetermined data for each type of<br>
wafer 11. Moreover, the detecting device 39 may be<br>
configured as an independent device for measuring a surface<br>
shape of a wafer, without placing the detecting device in<br>
the single wafer etching apparatus 10.<br>
[0030] The method for etching the wafer 11 using the<br>
single wafer etching apparatus 10 as constructed above will<br>
be described.<br>
[0031] At first, in the state that the wafer 11 is<br><br><br>
mounted on the chuck 12, a vacuum pump, which is connected<br>
to and communicated with the bottom end of the through hole<br>
16c of a holding assembly 16, is actuated to make the<br>
pressures of the through hole 16c, communicating hole 16d,<br>
small hole 16f, and ring groove 16e negative, and the<br>
negative pressures then keep the wafer 11 in a horizontal<br>
position. In this state, the driving motor of the spinning<br>
device is actuated to allow the wafer 11 to spin in<br>
horizontal plane together with the holding assembly 16 and<br>
the base member 13. Alternatively, only the holding axis<br>
21 may spin, while the base member 19 is not allowed to<br>
spin and fixed. Subsequently, the rotary motor 41a of the<br>
first nozzle-moving device 41 and the stepping motor 42a of<br>
the second nozzle-moving device 42 are respectively driven<br>
so as to move the first supply nozzle 31 to a position that<br>
allows the discharge opening 31a to face to the center of<br>
the front surface of the wafer and so as to turn the second<br>
supply nozzle 32 to a position that allows the discharge<br>
opening 32a to face to the periphery of the front surface<br>
of the wafer, and then the first and second pumps 51c, 52c<br>
are driven and the first and second flow control valves 51d,<br>
52d are opened so as to supply the first and second etching<br>
solutions 21, 22 from the first and second discharge<br>
openings 31a, 32a of the first and second supply nozzles 31,<br>
32 to the center of the front surface and the periphery of<br>
the front surface of the wafer 11, respectively. The first<br>
etching solution 21 supplied on the center of the front<br><br><br>
surface of the wafer 11 gradually moves toward the edge<br>
portion of the wafer 11 from the periphery of the front<br>
surface of the wafer 11 while etching a processing-strained<br>
layer on the front surface of the wafer. The centrifugal<br>
force with the spinning movement of the wafer 11 makes most<br>
of the first and second etching solutions 21, 22 on the<br>
wafer 11 into droplets and scatters these droplets outside<br>
of the wafer 11, followed by discharging them outside of<br>
the chamber.<br>
[0032] Here, when the first etching solution supplied<br>
from the first supply nozzle to the center of the front<br>
surface of the wafer is set to a temperature higher than<br>
the temperature of the second etching solution supplied<br>
from the second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front<br>
surface of the wafer, the etching rate of the wafer with<br>
the first etching solution increases higher than the<br>
etching rate of the second etching solution. As a result,<br>
the excessive etching of the periphery of the wafer 11 can<br>
be compensated and the wafer 11 can be effectively provided<br>
with high flatness. In addition, when the first etching<br>
solution supplied from the first supply nozzle to the<br>
center of the front surface of the wafer is an etching<br>
solution having a higher etching rate than that of the<br>
second etching solution supplied from the second supply<br>
nozzle to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer,<br>
the etching rate of the wafer with the first etching<br>
solution is higher than the etching rate of the wafer with<br><br><br>
the second etching solution. As a result, the excessive<br>
etching of the periphery of the wafer 11 can be compensated<br>
and the wafer can be effectively provided with high<br>
flatness. Furthermore, when the supply flow rate of the<br>
first etching solution supplied from the first supply<br>
nozzle to the center of the front surface of the wafer is<br>
higher than the supply flow rate of the second etching<br>
solution supplied from the second supply nozzle to the<br>
periphery of the front surface of the wafer, the etching<br>
rate of the wafer with the first etching solution increases<br>
higher than the etching rate of the wafer with the second<br>
etching solution. As a result, the excessive etching of<br>
the periphery of the wafer 11 is compensated and the wafer<br>
can be effectively provided with high flatness.<br>
[0033] Note that although the embodiment has been<br>
explained for a situation for repairing an excessive<br>
etching of a periphery of a wafer 11 which becomes<br>
problematic upon etching by a single supply nozzle, the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto. Since a surface<br>
shape of a wafer after slicing or of a wafer subjected to a<br>
mechanical flattening process including lapping after<br>
slicing, is not uniform in a radial direction of the wafer<br>
and has a thickness variation, undulations, and the like<br>
caused thereon, it is enough to conduct etching so as to<br>
repair them. Namely, it is possible to effectively attain<br>
high flatness of a wafer 11, by previously measuring a<br>
surface shape of the wafer 11 before etching, and by<br><br><br>
adjusting one or more conditions selected from the group<br>
consisting of temperatures, kinds, and supply flow rates of<br>
etching solutions to be supplied from the etching solution<br>
supply nozzles, depending on the surface shape of the wafer,<br>
so as to compensate for a difference between the measured<br>
surface shape and an intended surface shape of the wafer 11<br>
after etching. Furthermore, although the above embodiment<br>
has been described for a situation where the number of<br>
supply nozzles is two, the supply nozzles may be three,<br>
four, or more, in number.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0034] Next, Examples of the present invention will be<br>
described in more detail with reference to Comparative<br>
Example.<br>
[0035] <example><br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a wafer obtained by<br>
slicing a silicon single crystal ingot was subjected to<br>
chamfering and mechanical grinding (lapping), so that there<br>
was also prepared a silicon wafer 11 of 300 mm in diameter<br>
of which front and back surfaces were flattened. In<br>
addition, a first etching solution 21 was prepared by<br>
mixing an aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight<br>
concentration of 50%, an aqueous nitric acid solution at a<br>
weight concentration of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid<br>
solution at a weight concentration of 85% in a volume ratio<br>
of 4 : 7.4 : 6 and then reserved in a first tank 51a heated<br><br><br>
at 30°C. On the other hand, a second etching solution 22<br>
was prepared by mixing 50% by weight concentration of an<br>
aqueous fluorine acid solution, 70% by weight concentration<br>
of an aqueous nitric acid solution, and 80% by weight<br>
concentration of an aqueous phosphoric acid solution in a<br>
volume ratio of 4 : 7.4 : 6 and then reserved in a second<br>
tank 52a heated at 20°C. Under such conditions, a wafer 11<br>
was mounted on a chuck 12 such that the front surface of<br>
the wafer 11 was faced upwardly. Subsequently, the wafer<br>
11 was horizontally rotated. After that, the first<br>
discharge opening 31a of a first supply nozzle 31 was then<br>
reciprocated, between - 50 mm to + 50 mm from a basic point<br>
(0 mm), which was the center of the front surface of the<br>
wafer 11, or the center of the wafer 11, at a velocity of<br>
40 mm/sec, while the second discharge opening 32a of a<br>
second supply nozzle 32 was then reciprocated between 30 mm<br>
to 0 mm from a basic point (0 mm), which was the periphery<br>
of the front surface of the wafer 11, or the periphery of<br>
the wafer 11, at a velocity of 40 mm/sec. Under such<br>
conditions, the first etching solution 21 was supplied from<br>
the first supply nozzle 31 onto the center of the front<br>
surface of the wafer 11 at a flow rate of 4 1/min, while<br>
the second etching solution 22 was supplied from the second<br>
supply nozzle 32 onto the periphery of the front surface of<br>
the wafer 11. By centrifugal force generated by the<br>
horizontal spinning of the wafer 11, the first etching<br>
solution 21 was spread out from the center of the front<br><br><br>
surface of the wafer 11 to the edge thereof, while the<br>
second etching solution 22 was spread out from the<br>
periphery of the front surface of the wafer 11 to the side<br>
end thereof, thereby etching a processing-strained layer<br>
caused by the planarization processing of the wafer 11.<br>
Therefore, the etched wafer was provided for Example 1.<br>
[0036] <example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that a second etching solution<br>
used was an etching solution prepared by mixing an aqueous<br>
hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 50%,<br>
an aqueous nitric acid solution at a weight concentration<br>
of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid solution at a weight<br>
concentration of 85% at a volume ratio of 3 : 8: 6 and then<br>
kept at a temperature of 30°C. Therefore, the etched wafer<br>
was provided for Example 2.<br>
[0037] <example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that the second etching solution<br>
was supplied from the second supply nozzle onto the<br>
periphery of the front surface of the wafer at a flow rate<br>
of 3 1/min. Therefore, the etched wafer was provided for<br>
Example 3.<br>
[0038] <example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that a second etching solution<br>
used was an etching solution prepared by mixing an aqueous<br><br><br>
hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 50%,<br>
an aqueous nitric acid solution at a weight concentration<br>
of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid solution at a weight<br>
concentration of 85% at a volume ratio of 3 : 8: 6.<br>
Therefore, the etched wafer was provided for Example 4.<br>
[0039] <example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that a second etching solution<br>
used was an etching solution prepared by mixing an aqueous<br>
hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 50%,<br>
an aqueous nitric acid solution at a weight concentration<br>
of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid solution at a weight<br>
concentration of 85% at a volume ratio of 3 : 8: 6 and then<br>
kept at a temperature of 30°C. Subsequently, the second<br>
etching solution was supplied from the second supply nozzle<br>
onto the periphery of the front surface of the wafer at a<br>
flow rate of 3 1/min. Therefore, the etched wafer was<br>
provided for Example 5.<br>
[0040] <example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that the temperature of the<br>
second etching solution was kept at 30°C and the second<br>
etching solution was supplied from the second supply nozzle<br>
to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer at a<br>
flow rate of 3 1/min. Therefore, the etched wafer was<br>
provided for Example 6.<br>
[0041] <example><br><br><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that a second etching solution<br>
used was an etching solution prepared by mixing an aqueous<br>
hydrofluoric acid solution at a weight concentration of 50%,<br>
an aqueous nitric acid solution at a weight concentration<br>
of 70%, and an aqueous phosphoric acid solution at a weight<br>
concentration of 85% at a volume ratio of 3 : 8: 6.<br>
Subsequently, the second etching solution was supplied from<br>
the second supply nozzle onto the periphery of the front<br>
surface of the wafer at a flow rate of 3 1/min. Therefore,<br>
the resulting wafer was provided for Example 7.<br>
[0042] <comparative example><br>
Etching of wafer was carried out by the same way as<br>
that of Example 1, except that the second etching solution<br>
was kept at a temperature of 30°C. The resulting wafer was<br>
provided for Comparative Example 1.<br>
[0043] The temperatures (°C) of the first and second<br>
solutions, kinds (the percentages of the aqueous<br>
fluorinated acid (HF) solution in the mixtures) (% by<br>
weight), and flow rates (1/m) of the first and second<br>
etching solutions of Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative<br>
Example 1 as described above are listed in Table 1 with the<br>
differences between the first and second etching solutions.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0045] <comparative test and evaluation><br>
Thicknesses of the respective silicon wafers, on<br>
which the single wafer etching procedures were performed<br>
according to Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Example 1,<br>
were measured using a flatness-measuring equipment<br>
(Wafercom, manufactured by Doi Precision Lapping Co., Ltd.),<br>
respectively.. The measuring results in Example 1 to 7 are<br>
shown in FIGS. 3 to 9 and the measuring results in<br>
Comparative Example 1 are shown in FIG. 10. As is evident<br>
from FIGS. 3 to 10, Examples 1 to 7 (FIGS. 3 to 9), which<br>
represent the surfaces of the respective wafers 11 etched<br><br>
by supplying the first and second etching solutions from<br>
the respective first and second supply nozzles, were found<br>
to be flat, compared with Comparative Example 1 (FIG. 10)<br>
which represents the surface of the wafer etched by<br>
supplying the etching solution form the single supply<br>
nozzle.<br>

claim 1, wherein<br>
the plurality of etching solution supply nozzles<br>
include a first supply nozzle that supplies a first etching<br>
solution to the center of the front surface of the wafer<br>
and a second supply nozzle that supplies a second etching<br>
solution to the periphery of the front surface of the wafer,<br>
where<br><br>
the supply flow rate of the first etching solution<br>
supplied from the first supply nozzle to the center of the<br>
front surface of the wafer is higher than the supply flow<br>
rate of the second etching solution supplied from the<br>
second supply nozzle to the periphery of the front surface<br>
of the wafer.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for etching a single wafer, which effectively<br>
realizes a high flatness of wafer and an increase in<br>
productivity thereof. In a method for etching a single<br>
wafer, a single thin disk-like wafer sliced from a silicon<br>
single crystal ingot is spun, and a front surface of the<br>
wafer is etched with an etching solution supplied thereto.<br>
In the method, a plurality of supply nozzles are disposed<br>
above and opposite to the front surface of the wafer at<br>
different portions in the radial direction of the wafer,<br>
respectively; and then one or more conditions selected from<br>
the group consisting of temperatures, kinds, and supply<br>
flow rates of etching solutions from the plurality of<br>
supply nozzles are changed.</comparative></comparative></example></example></example></example></example></example></example></td>
