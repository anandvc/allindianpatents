A second subject of the present invention is processes for preparing the compounds<br>
of formula I according to the invention.<br>
Thus, the compounds of formula I can be prepared according to the process<br>
represented in Scheme 1.<br><br><br><br>
According to the process of Scheme 1, the compounds of formula i, in which R2 is<br>
other than a hydrogen atom, are prepared by amminative reduction, by reacting a<br>
secondary amine of formula I, in which R2 represents H, with an aldehyde or a<br>
ketone of formula III, where R6 and R7, after reaction, together form R2 as defined in<br>
formula I. The compounds of formula I where R2 represents a hydrogen atom can be<br>
obtained by deprotection of the compounds of formula II, according to conventional<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the compounds of formula II,<br>
when Pg is a trifluoroacetyl group, can be deprotected in the presence of a base<br>
such as, for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonia or barium<br>
hydroxide in a protic solvent, such as water or methanol or a mixture of these<br>
solvents, at a temperature between 0 and 100°C. Alternatively, the deprotection of<br>
the compounds of formula II, when Pg is a trifluoroacetyl group, can be carried out in<br>
the presence of an acid such as, for example, hydrochloric acid in a protic or aprotic<br>
solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture of these<br>
solvents, at a temperature between 0 and 100°C. Illustrations of the process are<br>
given in the examples.<br>
The starting compounds of formula II can be prepared according to Scheme 2 or can<br>
be synthesized by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
According to this scheme, the compounds of formula II, in which n, R1 and B are as<br>
defined in formula I, can be prepared by reaction of an amine of formula V, in which<br>
R1 and B are as defined in formula I, with a sulfonyl chloride of formula IV, in which<br>
Pg represents an appropriate protective group such as, for example, a<br>
trifluoroacetamide, so as to form a derivative of sulfonamide type of formula II,<br>
according to conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, the<br>
reaction can be carried out in a protic or aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethyIformamide or acetonitrile or a mixture of<br>
these solvents, at a temperature of between 0 and 100°C, in the presence of a base<br><br>
such as, for example, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, diisopropylethylamine<br>
or triethylamine.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula II can be prepared by a Mitsunobu type<br>
reaction, according to Scheme 3.<br><br>
According to this alternative, a sulfonamide of formula VII, in which R1 is as defined<br>
in formula I, is reacted with an amino alcohol of formula VIII, in which n and B are as<br>
defined above. The reaction can be carried out conventionally in the presence of<br>
Mitsunobu reagents, such as an azo derivative, for example diethylazodicarboxylate,<br>
diisopropylazodicarboxylate, di-tert-butylazodicarboxylate, 1,1'-<br>
(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine or N,N,N',N -tetramethylazodicarboxamide, and a<br>
phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine or tributylphosphine. The reaction can be<br>
carried out in an aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or a mixture of<br>
these solvents, at a temperature between 0 and 100°C, to give the compound of<br>
formula II. The sulfonamide of formula VII in which R1 is as defined in formula I can<br>
be prepared by reaction of an amine of formula VI, in which R1 is as defined in<br>
formula I, with a sulfonyl chloride of formula IV, in which Pg represents an<br>
appropriate protective group such as, for example, a trifluoroacetamide, according to<br>
conventional methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, the reaction can<br>
be carried out in a protic or aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, la N,N-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile or a mixture<br>
of these solvents, at a temperature between 0 and 100°C, in the presence of a base<br>
such as, for example, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, diisopropylethylamine<br>
or triethylamine.<br><br>
The starting compounds IV and the amines of formulae V and VIII are directly<br>
commercially available, can be synthesized by conventional methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art, or are known in the literature.<br>
For example, the diamines of formula V, in which n is equal to 3, can be prepared<br>
according to Scheme 4.<br><br>
According to this process, the compounds of formula V, in which n is equal to 3, R1<br>
represents a hydrogen atom and B represents an amine group, can be prepared by<br>
means of an addition reaction of an amine of formula X, in which R3 and R4 are as<br>
defined above, with the acrylonitrile of formula IX, so as to form a derivative of<br>
aminonitrile type of formula XI, according to conventional methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art, followed by reduction of the nitrile. The reduction can be carried out<br>
according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example in the presence of<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride at a temperature between -70°C and 40°C in an aprotic<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene or a mixture of these solvents; the<br>
reduction can also be carried out in the presence of a reducing agent, such as<br>
hydrogen, in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum, palladium or Raney nickel,<br>
in a solvent such as methanol or ethyl acetate, so as to give the compound of formula<br>
V, in which n is equal to 3, R1 represents a hydrogen atom and B represents an<br>
amine group. The compounds of formula V, in which R1 represents a C1-6alkyl group,<br>
can be prepared by alkylation of the compound of formula V obtained above,<br>
according to conventional methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also the compounds of formula II, when Pg<br>
represents a protective group or a hydrogen atom, as intermediates for the<br>
preparation of the compound of formula I.<br>
The following examples illustrate the processes and techniques suitable for the<br>
preparation of this invention, without, however, limiting the scope of the claim.<br>

The table below illustrates the chemical structures and the physical properties of<br>
some compounds according to the invention. The elemental microanalyses and the<br>
NMR, IR or mass spectra confirm the structures of the compounds obtained.<br>
In the table, for the compounds of formula I, "Mp." corresponds to the melting point.<br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention of formula I were subjected to pharmacological<br>
assays which showed their advantage as active substances in therapeutics.<br><br>
More particularly, the compounds of the invention are histamine H3-receptor<br>
antagonists. H3 receptors are known to those skilled in the art and their advantage in<br>
therapeutics has been described in the literature ("Histamine H3 receptor<br>
antagonists" Exp. Opinion Ther. Patents (2000) ;U) (7) -.1045-1055).<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention of formula I were subjected to an in vitro<br>
affinity assay on the native histamine H3 receptor in an adult rat brain membrane<br>
preparation, by specific binding of [3H]-N-a-methylhistamine to this receptor,<br>
according to the methods described by A. Korte et al., in Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun. 168, 979-986(1990) and by R.E. West Jr. et al., in Mol. Pharmacol. 38,<br>
61O-613(1990).<br>
The Kj values for the compounds of the invention with respect to H3 receptors are<br>
between 0.1 nM and 5.0 |j.M, and, more particularly, (+/-)-2-(cyclohexylmethyl)-N-[2-<br>
(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-7-sulfonamide<br>
(compound 15; Table 1) has a Ki of 0.3 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention of formula I were also subjected to a cAMP<br>
formation assay, on the human histamine H3 receptor transfected into CHO cells, by<br>
inhibition of the agonism caused by the specific binding of R-a-methylhistamine to<br>
this receptor, according to the methods described by T.W. Lovenberg et al., in<br>
J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 293, 771-778(2000).<br>
The IC50 values for the compounds of the invention with respect to H3 receptors are<br>
between 0.1 nM and 5.0 µM.<br>
By way of example, compound 15, included in Table 1, has an IC50
EIA kit (Amersham) to measure cAMP formation, on the human histamine H3<br>
receptor transfected into CHO cells, by inhibition of the agonism caused by the<br>
specific binding of R-a-methylhistamine to this receptor.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have an activity that is selective for the<br>
histamine H3 receptor. Effectively, the compounds have a Ki of greater than 7.0 µM in<br>
the in vitro affinity assay on the native histamine H1 receptor in an adult rat brain<br>
membrane preparation by specific binding of [3H]-pirilamine to this receptor,<br>
according to the method described by Y.Q. Liu et al., in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.<br>
268,959(1994).<br><br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the invention of formula I were subjected to in vivo<br>
tests showing their ability to reduce food intake in rats fasting for 24 h.<br>
The experiments were carried out on Wistar rats. The rats were placed individually in<br>
transparent plastic cages 48x26, 5x21.5 cm. These cages were placed in a room<br>
insulated against any noise, at a temperature of 20 to 22°C, with a light cycle from 7<br>
o'clock in the morning to 7 o'clock in the evening, the rats having free access to water<br>
and to the food.<br>
Before the experiment was carried out, the rats were made to fast for 24 h, with<br>
access, however, to water ad libitum. On the day of the experiment, the carrier or the<br>
compound according to the present invention was administered i.p. or p.o., 15 or 30<br>
minutes before a known amount of food (30 g) was made available.<br>
Each hour, for 6 hours, the amount of food ingested by the rat was measured.<br>
It was shown that the AD50 values (mg/kg i.p. or p.o.) for the compounds of the<br>
invention with respect to food intake may be less than 10. For example, (+/-)-2-(4-<br>
isopropylbenzyl)-N-[2-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-7-<br>
sulfonamide (compound 24; Table 1) δecreases food intake by 54% during the first<br>
hour after the i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg of the product.<br>
The results of the tests show that the compounds of the invention make it possible to<br>
reduce food intake in animals. Thus, they make it possible to control weight gain, to<br>
treat obesity or to aid weight loss, in animals, but also in humans.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicaments<br>
which comprise a compound of formula I or an addition salt of the latter with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid or else a hydrate or a solvate of the compound of<br>
formula I.<br>
These medicaments find their use in therapeutics, in particular in the treatment of<br>
pathologies in which a histamine H3-receptor antagonist provides a therapeutic<br>
benefit. In particular, such pathologies are obesity and diabetes. In addition, these<br>
compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system diseases such<br>
as vigilance and sleep disorders, narcolepsy, Alzheimer's disease and other<br>
dementias, Parkinson's disease, attention disorders in hyperkinetic children, memory<br>
and learning disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, moderate cognitive disorders,<br>
depression and anxiety. The states of depression and anxiety include, for example,<br>
anxieties of anticipatory type (before a surgical procedure, before a dental treatment,<br><br>
etc), anxiety caused by alcohol or drug dependency or withdrawal, mania, seasonal<br>
affective disorders, migraines and nausea. They can also be used in the treatment of<br>
sexual dysfunction, dizziness and travel sickness.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention for the preparation of a<br>
medicament for use in treating the pathologies mentioned above is an integral part of<br>
the invention.<br>

pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Said excipients are chosen according to the<br>
pharmaceutical form and the method of administration desired, from the usual<br>
excipients that are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual,<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, intratracheal, intranasal,<br>
transdermal or rectal administration, the active ingredient of formula I above, or<br>
possible salt, solvate or hydrate thereof, can be administered in unit administration<br>
form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients, to animals or to<br>
human beings for the prophylaxis or the treatment of the disorders or of the diseases<br>
above.<br>
The appropriate unit administration forms comprise oral administration forms, such as<br>
tablets, soft or hard gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or<br>
suspensions, sublingual, buccal, intratracheal or intranasal administration forms,<br>
forms for administration by inhalation, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular or intravenous administration forms, rectal administration forms, and<br>
implants. For topical application, the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
used in creams, gels, ointments or lotions.<br>
In order to obtain the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect, the dose of active<br>
ingredient can range between 0.1 µg and 50 mg per kg of bodyweight and per day.<br>
Each unit dose can contain from 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably from 1 to 500 mg, of<br>
active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. This unit dose can<br>
be administered 1 to 5 times a day so as to administer a daily dose of from 0.5 to<br>
5000 mg, preferably from 1 to 2500 mg.<br><br>
There may be specific cases were higher or lower dosages are appropriate. Such<br>
dosages also belong to the invention. According to the usual practice, the dosage<br>
appropriate for each patient is determined by the physician according to the method<br>
of administration and the weight and response of said patient.<br>
