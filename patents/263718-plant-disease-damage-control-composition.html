Test Example 1    Control Effect Against Sugar Beet Seedling Damping Off<br>
A Rhizoctonia culture and a Pythmm culture were separately cultivated at 25°C for seven days in a wheat bran medium, and after respectively grinding, the Rhizoctonia culture and/or the Pythium culture were added to and mixed in with sterilized soil, at amounts of:<br>
0.1% of Rhizoctonia culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil;<br>
0.1% of Pythmm culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil; and<br>
0.1% of Rhizoctonia culture and 0.1%o of Physium culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil.    These were filled in plastic pots and the infected soils were thus obtained.<br>
Subsequently, amounts of 17.5% and 8.75% with respect to the weight of the seeds of each of the respective powder formulations of Example 1 and Reference Example 1 (comparative chemical), and amounts of 0.5% and 1.0% with respect to the weight of the seeds of a commercially available seed fungicide (TACHIGAREN, trade name, a dust coating agent containing hydroxyisoxazol, made by Sankyo Agro Co., Ltd.) were respectively added to sugar beet seeds (variety: ABEND), and mixed.    Sowing was carried out at five seeds per pot, with a total of 20 pots, respectively, of the sugar beet seed to which chemical treatment had been carried out and the sugar beet seed to which no chemical treatment had been earned, and grown on in a greenhouse.    The number of non-sprouting seeds at 7 days after sowing, and the seedling dieback number at 14 days after sowing were examined with the naked eye, and the seedling dieback rate was computed by the following Formula 1.    Moreover, the existence or not of occurrences of phytotoxicity was also examined with the naked eye.      Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Formula 1:    Seedling dieback rate = ((number of non-sprouting seeds + seedling dieback number) / number of seeds sown) x 100<br>
 [0036] Table 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0037]<br>
Test Example 2   Control Effect against Common Scab and Black Scarf in Potato<br>
A Rhizoctoma culture was cultivated in a wheat bran medium at 25 °C for seven days, and this was then added at 0.1 % with respect to the weight of steam sterilized soil and mixed in uniformly.<br>
A Rhizoctonia culture cultivated by the same procedure was added at 0.1% with respect to the weight of soil extracted from a field infected by common scab and mixed in uniformly.<br>
Soil was extracted from a field infected by common scab.<br>
These three soil compositions were placed, respectively, into concrete pots (50 cm length x 50 cm width x 30 cm depth) and the test soils were thereby obtained.<br>
Next, potato seeds of potato (variety- Baron) were dipped into, respectively, 50 times<br>
diluents of the wettable powders produced in Example 2, Reference Example 2, and Reference Example 3 (comparative agents), and of a commercial fungicide (NOTTOBAN, trade name, a wettable powder containing tolclofos-methyl and flusulfamide, made by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a control chemical.    The seed potatoes were air dried and two seed potatoes were buried per pot and grown on.    For the non-treated plot, seed potatoes that had not undergone chemical treatment were buried.    110 days after burying the seed potatoes, the newly formed potatoes were dug up, and the existence of disease onset was examined with the naked eye, and the disease onset potato ratio was computed by the following Formula 2.    Moreover, the existence or not of occurrences of phytotoxicity was also examined with the naked eye.      Five replicates of the above test were performed, and the average values of the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Formula 2: Disease onset potato ratio =<br>
(number of potatoes with disease onset / total number of potatoes examined) x 100<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
 [0039]<br>
Test Example 3:    Control Effect of Damping-Off in Rice Seedlings<br>
A Rhizoctonia culture, a Fusarium culture and a Pythium culture were separately cultivated at 25°C for seven days in a wheat bran medium, and after respectively grinding, the Rhizoctonia culture, the Fusarium culture and/or the Pythium culture were added to and mixed in with sterilized soil, at amounts of:<br>
O.P/o of Rhizoctonia culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil;<br>
0.1% of Fusarium culture with respect to the weight of stenlized soil;<br>
0.1% of Pythium culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil;<br>
0.1%) of Rhizoctonia culture and 0.1% of Fusarium culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil; and<br>
0.1% of Rhizoctonia culture and 0.1 % of Physium culture with respect to the weight of sterilized soil.    The infected soils were thus obtained.<br>
Subsequently, soils in rice seedling boxes were treated with the powder formulation prepared in Example 1 and Reference Example 1, and a commercially available seed fungicide (TACHIGAREN, trade name, a powder formulation containing hydroxyisoxazol made by Sankyo Agro Co., Ltd.) as a control chemical, respectively, at amounts of 3g and 6g per rice seedling box (580 mm length x 280 mm width x 14 mm depth), and well mixed.    After filling the above-mentioned infected soils in the rice seedling box, 100 seeds of force sprouted rice seeds were sown, covered with the infected soils and grown on in a greenhouse.    The existence of disease onset was examined for all the seedlings with the naked eye at 30 days after starting cultivation, and the disease onset seedling ratio was computed by the following Formula 3. Moreover, the existence or not of occurrences of phytotoxicity was also examined with the naked eye.      Results are shown in Table 3.<br>
Formula 3: Disease onset seedling ratio =<br>
(number of diseased seedlings/ number of seeds sown) x 100<br>
[0040] Table 3<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0041]<br>
Test Example 4    Control Effect against Sclerotinia Stem Rot and Foot rot in Cabbage<br>
Test soils were prepared by:<br>
cultivating a Rhizoctonia culture at 25°C for seven days in a wheat bran medium, adding this at 0.1% by weight to soil, and mixing uniformly to provide the test soil for foot rot; and<br>
cultivating Sclerotium on a potato dextrose agar medium, adding this at 0.1% by weight to soil, and mixing uniformly to provide the test soil for Sclerotinia stem rot.<br>
Next, the infected soils were put in a concrete pot (5 m length x 2 m width x 60 cm depth), and the powder formulations prepared in Example 4 and Reference Example 6, and a commercial fungicide (NEBIJIN, trade name, a powder formulation containing flusulfamide made by Sankyo Agro Co., Ltd.) as a control chemical, were distributed, on the surface of the infected soils at 30 kg per 10 are, respectively, and then incorporated into the soils.    After the chemical treatment, 100 seeds of cabbage seed (variety: KXNKEI No. 201) were sown, respectively, and these were grow on.    The existence of disease onset was examined with the naked eye at 110 days after sowing, and disease onset plant ratio was computed by the following formula 4.    Moreover, the existence or not of occurrences of phytotoxicity was also examined with the naked eye. Results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Formula 4: Disease onset plant ratio =<br>
(number of plants with disease onset / total number of plants examined) x 100<br>
