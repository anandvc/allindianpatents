BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to interactive multimedia, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for interfacing with intelligent three-dimensional objects.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
The term "multi media" includes many technologies such as video and interactive three-dimensional ("3D") technology. Interactive 3D has gained recent popularity due to numerous benefits over two-dimensional technology as well as advantages over plain text or viu'eo. First, interactive 3D is unlike a 3D movie in that interactive 3D contains content that is an interactive experience. That is, 3D content, used in conjunction with a computer, enables a user to move objects on the screen and explore different spaces on the screen. A user is able to independently examine objects and wander throughout a "world," i.e. a 3D space. For example, a typical training video teaching a person how to assemble a part<br><br>
would be rerun several times in order to fiilly understand the assembly process. However, using interactive 3D, a user assembles the item and then may take the item apart and put the item back together until the assembly process is truly understood. A second advantage of using interactive 3D is that a user's viewpoint belongs to the user, not to the author of the content. Thus, a user may rotate an object or walk around the object to change the view angle. Thirdly, a user may also view objects in different sequences as opposed to watching such objects sequentially which is what occurs in a video.<br>
Even with the popularity of interactive 3D, the widespread use of interactive 3D is limited by storage, delivery and application integration limitations of present- day interactive 3D. 3D content, which is generally the programming language creating a 3D object, is typically stored as a file on a server and then visualized to a user by an application ("plug-in") over a data network, such as the Internet. This model is known as a file server model. In general, the file server model is shown in prior art FIG. 1 within the dashed line 15. Prior art FIG. 1 is a block diagram view of a typical use of 3D content 10. In FIG. 1, the file server model 15 includes the 3D content 10 developed by a content developer in a programming language. The 3D content is typically written in a programming language known as Virtual Reality Modeling Language ("VRML"). A description of VRML is available in the publication "The Virtual Reality Modeling Language," ISO/JEC 14772-1: 1997, incorporated herein by reference. A brief example of VRML is provided below in prior art FIG. 2. Returning to prior art FIG. 1, the content developer prepares, in VRML, a file that contains the 3D content to be viewed. A browser on the Internet 100 that wishes to view the 3D content 10 uses a "plug-in" application 90 that is generally loaded into the browser on the Internet 100 in order to visualize the 3D content 10 stored as a file.<br><br>
A problem with the 3D content stored as a file is that such 3D content is not able to be accessed by a user, such as an application developer 50, that wishes to create an application to interact with the 3D content 10, unless such developer knows VRML. In essence, the 3D content 10 written in VRML is opaque, or not accessible by the application developer, who wishes to use the 3D content to create a packaged software product 70. Thus, the storage and delivery of the 3D content as a file is a limitation of the file server model since application developers must know VRML to interact with the 3D content.<br>
Prior art FIG. 2 is a brief example of VRML that demonstrates the type of understanding of VRML needed by an application developer TO create an application that interfaces with 3D content. Prior art FIG. 2 is an example of VRML defining a box 110. In FIG. 2, the 3D content 10 defines the box 110 that an application developer 50 would wish to incorporate into a graphical scene as part of a packaged software product 70 (FIG. 1). To permit the application developer 50 to use the 3D content 10 in the packaged software product 70 being developed, the application developer 50 must be sufficiently familiar with VRML.<br>
VRML is a sophisticated programming language that many application developers 50 may not understand. In FIG. 2, a box 110 is defined by the VRML below the box 110. In general, the box 110 is considered an object that the VRML is able to create, change properties of and connect with other objects. At section 115, VRML has created a new object labeled DEF BOX_GRP. In the next section 120, the Properties 120 of the box are defined and changed. Specifically, at VRML line 130, the box is translated to a certain 3D coordinate (4 .2 1.) At VRML line 140, the box is rotated to a certain orientation (0 11.9). At VRML line 150, a subgroup labeled Children is defined to include a shape, at VRML line 160, having the geometry of a box, at VRML line 170, and a particular appearance from VRML line 180.  A certain material at VRML 190 is then defined including a<br><br>
particular color. A third section would then create a Route 125 that would match, move or coordinate the box 110 with other objects within the graphical scene of the plugin application (FIG. 1). Thus, VRML provides 3D content that contains Groups 115, Properties 120 and Routes 125 that permit the box 110 to be defined.<br>
However, even if the application developer 50 (FIG. 1) is somewhat familiar with VRML, the integration of the 3D content 10 to the application being developed by the application developer 50 to create a packaged software product 70 is very difficult due to the complexity of VRML. An application developer must study the VRML to locate the 3D content needed and integrate those fields into the application being developed. This process is very complicated and time consuming. A need therefore exists for a user to be able to quickly and easily access different 3D content in VRML without knowing VRML or having to locate specifications and operations in the 3D content.<br>
One attempted solution to this application integration problem has been the use of an External Authoring Interface (EAI). A description of EAI is available in the publication "External Authoring Interface," ISO/EC 14772-1:1997 Appendix B, incorporated herein by reference. EAI has attempted to expose the 3D content to the application but has failed to provide a generic method for providing application integration. EAI has failed since EAI, like VRML itself, is very complicated and difficult to understand. A second problem with EAI is that it is limited in scene graph management. That is, EAI is not able to maintain direct pointers to objects in a scene and is also not able to determine the properties of an object unless the application developer knows the complex VRML. Thirdly, EAI does not provide the application developer with the ability to easily interface with the Groups, Properties and Routes of each object in the 3D content. EAI therefore has application integration limitations that does not solve the need for the<br><br>
integration between 3D content and an application being developed by an application developer (or user) wishing to interface with the 3D content.<br>
A second proposed solution to this application integration problem has been attempted by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington in a product commercially known as Chromeffects™. Chromeffects™ is an interactive media technology that is intended to improve the quality and performance of interactive media for the Internet and desktop applications. Chromeffects™ is based on HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) and represents 3D content in a "component" model. A component model to 3D content is an evolution from the object-oriented model that has previously been used. The component model to 3D content treats a 3D object as a simple component by exposing only a group of basic functions to describe the 3D object. That is, while the object-oriented model provides to a user all details of an object to be modeled, a component approach only provides to the user a particular set of functions that functionally and simply describe the object in order to simplify the interaction between the user and the object.<br>
A problem with Chromeffects™ is that the 3D content, based on HTML and XML, needs additional external scripting and interface scripting to provide the needed set of functions. Thus, the 3D content, created in HTML and XML, is not "intelligent," i.e. intrinsically contained within the 3D content, but instead needs additional content scripting and interface scripting. Such additional scripting takes more time and comes at a higher cost and complexity. Thus, Chromeffects™ is limited by the additional scripting or "intelligence" provided by the scripting to properly integrate the 3D content to an application.<br>
A need therefore remains to provide an interface to 3D content that does not require a user to know VRML and that does not require additional external and interface scripting.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following description, various embodiments of the method of the present invention for interfacing with intelligent 3D components will be provided. Alternative embodiments of the present invention will also be provided that identify practical applications of the present invention. Thus, while the present invention is directed to a method of interfacing with a three-dimensional object that is displayed, alternative embodiments implementing that method, including an apparatus, a computer system and a computer-readable medium, are also provided to practically apply and functionally detail the method of the present invention. It is understood, however, that the present invention is generally directed to a method of interfacing with a 3D object that is displayed by performing the steps of defining the three-dimensional object as a component with a component interface, displaying the component interface and interfacing with the 3D object through the component interface. The component intrinsically contains an intelligent content.<br><br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 3 -5.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a high-level block diagram of a computer system which is used, in one embodiment, to implement the method of the present invention. The computer system 246 of FIG. 3 includes a processor 230 and memory 225. Processor 230 may contain a single microprocessor, or may contain a plurality of microprocessors for configuring the computer system as a multi-processor system. Memory 225, stores, in part, instructions and data for execution by processor 23 0. If the system of the present invention is wholly or partially implemented in software, including a computer program, memory 225 stores the executable code when in operation. Memory 225 may include banks of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as well as high speed cache memory.<br>
The system ofFIG. 3 further includes a mass storage device 23 5, peripheral device(s) 240, input device(s) 255, portable storage medium drive(s) 260, a graphics subsystem 270 and a display 285. For purposes of simplicity, the components shown in FIG. 3 are depicted as being connected via a single bus 280. However, the components may be connected through one or more data transport means. For example, processor 23 0 and memory 225 may be connected via a local microprocessor bus, and the mass storage device 235, peripheral device(s) 240, portable storage medium drive(s) 260, and graphics subsystem 270 may be connected via one or more input/output (I/O) buses. Mass storage device 235, which is typically implemented with a magnetic disk drive or an optical disk drive, is a non-volatile storage device for storing data and instructions for use by processor 230. In another embodiment, mass storage device 235 stores the computer program implementing the method of the present invention for interfacing with a three-dimensional object for purposes of loading such program<br><br>
to memory 225. The method of the present invention also may be stored in processor 230.<br>
Portable storage medium drive 260 operates in conjunction with a portable non-volatile storage medium, such as a floppy disk, or other computer-readable medium, to input and output data and code to and from the computer system of FIG. 3. In one embodiment, the method of the present invention for interfacing with a three-dimensional object is stored on such a portable medium, and is input to the computer system 246 via the portable storage medium drive 260. Peripheral device(s) 240 may include any type of computer support device, such as an input/output (I/O) interface, to add additional functionality to :he computer system 246. For example, peripheral device(s) 240 may include a network interface card for interfacing computer system 246 to a network, a modem, and the like.<br>
Input device(s) 255 provide a portion of a user interface. Input device(s) 255 may include an alpha-numeric keypad for inputting alpha-numeric and other key information, or a pointing device, such as a mouse, a trackball, stylus or cursor direction keys. Such devices provide additional means for interfacing with the three-dimensional objects in the method of the present invention. In order to display textual and graphical information, the computer system 246 of FIG. 3 includes graphics subsystem 270 and display 285. Display 285 may include a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, liquid crystal display (LCD), other suitable display devices, or means for displaying, that enables a user to view a three-dimensional object. Graphics subsystem 270 receives textual and graphical information and processes the information for output to display 285. Display 285 can be used to display a three-dimensional object, component interfaces and/or display other information that is part of a user interface. The display 285 provides a practical application of the method of interfacing with a three-dimensional object of the present invention since the method of the present invention may be directly and<br><br>
practically implemented through the use of the display 285. The system 246 of FIG. 3 also includes an audio system 250. In one embodiment, audio system 250 includes a sound card that receives audio signals from a microphone that may be found in peripherals 240. Additionally, the system of FIG. 3 includes output devices 245. Examples of suitable output devices include speakers, printers, and the like.<br>
The devices contained in the computer system of FIG 3 are those typically found in general purpose computer systems, and are intended to represent a broad category of such computer components that are well known in the art. The system of FIG. 3 illustrates one platform which can be used for practically impiemertirvg the method of the present invention. Numerous other platforms can also suffice, such as Macintosh-based platforms available from Apple Computer, Inc., platforms with different bus configurations, networked platforms, multi-processor platforms, other personal computers, workstations, mainframes, navigation systems, and the like.<br>
Alternative embodiments of the use of the method of the present invention in conjunction with the computer system 246 further include using other display means for the monitor, such as CRT display, LCD display, projection displays, or the like. Likewise, any similar type of memory, other than memory 225, may be used. Other interface means, in addition to the component interfaces, may also be used including alpha-numeric keypads, other key information or any pointing devices such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, cursor or direction key.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram view of an embodiment of the method of interfacing with a three-dimensional object of the present invention. In FIG. 4, a sample three-dimensional object 340 is shown to be a cube. Such a three-dimensional object is displayed in any display means, including CRT display, LCD display, projection displays, monitors or the like. It is understood, however, that<br><br>
the three-dimensional object to be interfaced with using the method of the present invention may be any three-dimensional object. The three-dimensional object 340 is defined as a component using a three-dimensional content language, such as VRML. 3D content 300 is the programming language equivalent of a 3D object 340 viewed. By defining the 3D object as a component, the component is treated as a simple component, rather that a detailed object such as is used in an object-oriented description of a 3D object. In an alternative embodiment, the 3D content language is any virtual reality programming language that is "intelligent", that is, does not reqjiire additional scripting for content or interfacing with applications. It is understood, however, ihat other 3D content languages may be used as long as that 3D content language intrinsically contains an "intelligent" content, i.e., no additional external scripting or interface scripting is required to interface or access the 3D content. "Intelligent" 3D content is therefore 3D content that contains, intrinsically, within the language, the necessary content to interface with a user, without the need for additional scripting. The 3D content 300 is typically prepared by a content developer (not shown). In one embodiment, the 3D content 300 is practically implemented in a device of the computer system 246 (FIG. 3) in, for example, the memory 225 of the computer system of FIG. 3. It is further understood that the 3D content 300 as well as the computer program 310, the EAI 315 and the COM wrapper 320 may also all be located within the memory. However, it is understood that the 3D content 300 may also be stored in portions of the computer system of FIG. 3 that are capable of containing memory such as (in FIG. 3) processor 230, mass storage device 235 and portable storage medium drive(s) 260.<br>
Computer program 310 contains executable software that generates the component interfaces 331, to the 3D content 300, using the EAI 315 and COM wrapper 320 bridges. As previously discussed, the computer program 310 is, in<br><br>
one embodiment, located on the various storage means of FIG. 3 (e.g., memory 225, mass storage 235 or portable storage 260). In other embodiments, computer program 310 may be located on a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk of other portable or non-portable storage device. In still further embodiments, as discussed below, the computer program 310 may be located on an electronic signal transferred over a network, such as the Internet. The computer program 310 generates the component interfaces 331 on a display 285 and is able to interface with a user/application developer 330, through the component interfaces 331, to the 3D content 300. The 3D content 300 uses the EAI 315 to expose a scene graph formed by the 3D content 300 :o an application developer 330. A description of EAI is available in the publication "External Authoring Interface", ISO/EEC 14772-1: 1997 Appendix B, and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The COM wrapper 320, also stored in similar locations as computer program 310, such as memory 225, is a universal interface that "wraps" around the computer program 310 to permit the computer program 310 to communicate with the 3D content 300 through the EAI 315. The COM wrapper is an industry standard found in the publication, "The Component Object Model Specification," Draft Version 0.9, October 24,1995 Microsoft Corporation and Digital Equipment Corporation, and is incorporated herein by reference. The 3D content 300, EAI 315, computer program 310 and COM wrapper 320 are all located with storage of, for example, the computer system 246 or alternative storage devices as previously described. It is understood that the method of interfacing with a three-dimensional device of the present invention is practically implemented in one embodiment, in the computer system 246, but need not necessarily be implemented in such system as long as the method steps, as claimed below, are accomplished.<br>
The component interfaces 331 are part of the computer program 310, however are shown in FIG. 4 as separate from computer program 310 since the<br><br>
component interfaces are typically displayed in a display means 285, while the computer program 310 is not. The display means for displaying the component interfaces 331 includes a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, liquid crystal (LCD) display, a monitor (such as a computer monitor), a projection screen or any other type of screen, or monitor device that visually displays the 3D object. The component interfaces 331 include group interface 338, pickable interface 332, transformable interface 333, colorable interface 334, texture interface 336 and other component interfaces 335.<br>
The component interfaces 331 provide the following functions to access particular content in 3D content 300. The pickable interface 332 provides "access to mouse events in the 3D content 300, as such mouse events are commonly available in VRML. The transformable interface 333 provides access to the position, scale or rotation properties of the 3D content 300. The colorable interface 334 provides access to the color and material properties of the 3D content 300. The texture interface 336 provides access to the application of images to the surface of the 3D content 300. The group interface 338 provides access to the manipulation of the object scene graph hierarchy as is commonly known in the art. These component interfaces are displayed on a display for a user such as the application developer 330 to interface with a three-dimensional object, such as object 340 (FIG. 3). A processor 230 is used to execute the computer program 310 in conjunction with the display 285 in order to perform the method of the present invention. It is understood that while only a limited list of component interfaces is described herein, component interfaces may include an unlimited number of interfaces that functionally describe a 3D object. An example of such component interfaces are provided in Table 2 below.<br>
The component interface 331 also includes other component interfaces 335 which are known as extendable computer interfaces 335. The other component<br><br>
interfaces 335 permit an application developer or user to interface with the three-dimensional object in a manner other than the standard options listed as component interfaces 332-334,336,338. An extensive list of extension interfaces are provided in the example of Table 3. The advantage of having extension interfaces is that the application developer 330 or user is able to interface with a three-dimensional object in a manner outside of the listed component interfaces 331. It is understood, however, that additional other component interfaces, for extending the interface with a user, may be used.<br>
In use, a 3D object 340 is displayed on a display means 235. such as a monitor, CRT display, LCD display, screen, projection device or the like. Along with the 3D object 340, the display 285 also displays the component interfaces 331 through the use of processor 230 that executes the computer program 310 to display the component interfaces 331. A user, or application developer 330 who wishes to interface with the 3D object 340, is able to choose, from the component interfaces 331, which interface (332-336, 338) the user wishes to access. Upon choosing an interface, the computer program interfaces with the component interfaces 331, through COM wrapper 3 20, and then interfaces with the 3D content 300, through EAI315, to access the appropriate "intelligent" content of the 3D content 300. An example of the 3D content 300 is shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Significant advantages exist for the method of the present invention. First, the application developer 330 need not know VRML (contained in the 3D content) and the application may easily interface with the VRML to interface with the three-dimensional object 340 to develop additional 3D applications to the 3D object. Second, the application developer or user need not do additional scripting in order to provide additional 3D content or for interfacing with the 3D content since the 3D content is "intelligent," that is the 3D content, or component, intrinsically contains an intelligent content.   Thus, significant time saving occurs. Third, the<br><br>
embodiment of the method of the present invention shown in FIG. 4 permits a user to extend the component interfaces as shown by the other component interfaces 335. A user is therefore not limited by the "short list" of component interfaces 331. A further advantage of the present invention is that the three-dimensional object may be any object that is already defined in VRML 3D content 300 and, as such, is a component to which any of the component interfaces may apply regardless of the three-dimensional object to which an interface is necessary.<br>
Table 1 below is an example of the 3D content 300 of FIG. 4. The example is not intended to be either a compilable or executable program, a complete program language or contain all the features discussed above. It is a vHML illustrative of the various functions and processes implemented in the method of interfacing of the present invention that is consistent with the principles of the above-described invention. Table 1, as well as Tables 2 and 3, are subject to copyright protection to the extent described above in the copyright notice.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 3 below is an example of the other component interfaces 335 of FIG. 4 that enable a user to extend the component interfaces 331. The example is not intended to be either a compilable or executable program, a complete program language or contain all the features discussed above. It is a VRML illustrative of the various functions and processes implemented in the method of interfacing of the present invention that is consistent with the principals of the above-described invention. The other component interfaces 335 generally include the following extensions: a smartproperty list, a smartproperty, a smartwidget, a smartfactory, a property, a propertylist, an extension and an extensionfactory, as more fully derailed in the Table 3 below. The use of these extensions is to provide additional interfaces to the application programmer other than the component interfaces 332-334, 336, 338, thereby making the interfaces more expandable. The manner of making these extensions is detailed in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart of the method of the present invention. At block 3 50, the first step of the method of the present invention includes defining a 3D object as a component with a component interface. In one embodiment, the defining step 350 is performed in a three-dimensional content language, such as VRML, and includes the steps of defining the component in the three-dimensional content language and defining at least one property to describe the component. Examples of the properties that describe the component may be found in Table 1 which is the 3D content 300. The properties, sometimes referred to as fields in VRML, generally include color, shape, transformation, behavioral, event handling, and grouping. Also at step 3 50 is defined at least one route to interface the component with a second component (not shown). A second component may represent any otherthree-dimensional object otherthanthe original three-dimensional object (e.g.<br><br>
cube 340 of FIG. 4) to which a user wants to connect, or otherwise move the second component in relation to the original component. The routes include events and actions. An event is a message that is sent by a specific object in the 3D Content 300. An action receives that message and performs a function based the event received. The route is a mechanism that connects the event to the action. The properties and routes of the present invention are ail included in the 3D content 300 of FIG. 4,(Table 1) and are considered "intelligent" content. That is, the 3D content needs no additional scripting to define the content or provide interface with the 3D content. Thus, the 3D content, or VRML describing the three-dimensional object, is considered "intelligent' when all the properties, routes, and definitions are provided within the 3D content 300 or VRML itself. This is unlike other 3D languages which require external scripting to create to content as well as external scripting to interface with the 3D content or with other applications and as such are not considered "intelligent."<br>
Returning to FIG. 5, the next step 360 displays the component interfaces 331 of FIG. 4. The display is typically done on a monitor of a computer system but may also be displayed on any type of display means that may display a three-dimensional object. Such devices include CRT, LCD, a computer screen, a television, a projection screen and the like, or any other display device where digitally rendered representations are presented visually. The displaying step 360 is an important step in the practical implementation and function of the present invention that transforms the method of the present invention into an interfaceable means with a user. As such, the computer program is a practical application for interfacing with a three-dimensional object and acts as a programmed computer that functions as an interface between a user and a 3D object, without having to know the program language, e.g. VRML, of the 3D content. The computer has<br><br>
thus, through the method of the present invention, been transformed into an interface with complicated VRML.<br>
The next step of FIG. 5 of the method of the present invention includes interfacing with a three-dimensional object through the component interfaces. The interfacing is performed, in one embodiment, by first providing a plurality of the component interfaces to the user on a display and then the user selects one of the plurality of the component interfaces to access the 3D intelligent content 300 (FIG. 4). The user is able to select one of the plurality of the component interfaces through, in one embodiment, the interface devices of the computer system of FIG. 3 including an aipha-numeric keypad or a pointing device such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, cursor or direction keys. The application developer or user is thereby able to interface with the three-dimensional object through the selected one of the plurality of component interfaces.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention may be implemented using a conventional general purpose computer, such as the computer system of FIG. 3, or a specialized digital computer or microprocessor programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure, as will be apparent to those skilled in computer art. Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by skilled programmers based on teaching of the present disclosure, as will be apparent to those skilled in the software art. The invention may also be implemented by the preparation of the application specific integrated circuits or by interconnecting an appropriate network of conventional component circuits, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention also includes a computer program product which is a storage medium (media) having instructions stored thereon/in which can be used to program a computer to perform the method of interfacing of the present invention. The storage medium can include, but is not<br><br>
limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, DVD, CD ROMs, magnetic optical disks, RAMs, EPROM, EEPROM, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. On such medium/media, the computer program, 3D content, EAI and COM wrapper of FIG. 4 may be electronically stored.<br>
Stored on any one of the computer readable medium (media), the present invention includes software for controlling both the hardware of the general purpose/specialized computer or microprocessor, and for enabling the computer or microprocessor to interact with a human user or other mechanism utilizing the results of the present invention. Such software may include, but is not limited 10, device drivers, operating systems and user applications. Ultimately, such computer readable media further includes software for performing the method of interfacing of the present invention as described above.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the present invention also includes an apparatus for interfacing with a three-dimensional object that is displayed. A three-dimensional object is displayed on a monitor or other displaying means as described above, including a CRT display, LCD display, computer monitor, a screen, a projection device or the like. The apparatus first includes a means for defining the three-dimensional object as a component. Such means includes any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, DVD, CD ROMs, magnetic optical disks, RAMs, EPROM, EEPROM, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. The electronic instruction stored in that defining means includes the 3D content 300, EAI 315, computer program 310 and COM wrapper 320, in one embodiment. The apparatus further includes, in this embodiment, a means for displaying the component interfaces 331. The means for displaying the component interfaces is typically a monitor; however, other displaying means may be used, including a CRT display, LCD display, computer<br><br>
monitor, television monitor, other monitors, a screen, a projection device or the like.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention further includes a means for interfacing with the 3D object through the component interfaces. Such interfacing means includes a display means, as described above, to view the 3D object, storage means to store the 3D content 300, EAI 315, computer program 310, and COM wrapper 320 and a processor 230. In another embodiment, the interfacing means may further include an alpha-numeric keypad for inputting alpha-numeric and other key information, or a pointing device, such as a mouse, a trackball, stylus, or cursor direction keys.<br>
In another embodiment, the method of the present invention may be performed over a data network. That is, the defining step 350 of FIG. 5 defines the three-dimensional object as a component in a three-dimensional content language, where the component has component interfaces and intrinsically has intelligent content. The displaying step 360 of displaying the component interfaces is then performed by transferring an electronic signal over a network (e.g. a data network such as the Internet, a frame relay network, an ATM, or even a local area network that transfers the electronic signal over such network). The electronic signal transfers, for example, the 3D content 300, the computer program 310, the COM wrapper 320 and the EAI 315 over the network. It is understood, however, that one or more of these items may be transferred over the network alone, or in conjunction, and achieve the method of the present invention as claimed below. Once the electronic signal has been transferred over the network, the interfacing step 370 may be performed of interfacing with the 3D object through the component interfaces using the interfacing means and substeps of interfacing previously described above with regard to other embodiments. It is important to understand that merely transferring the computer program 310 and related items<br><br>
over a network, rather than as part of a computer system, such as shown in FIG. 3, does not avoid the scope of the present invention as claimed below.<br>
Obviously, numerous modification and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the attended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein.<br><br><br><br><br>
