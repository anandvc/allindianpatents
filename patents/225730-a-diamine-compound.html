				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DIAMINE DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds<br>
which inhibit activated blood coagulation factor X<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as "FXa") to exhibit a potent<br>
anticoagulant effect and can be orally administered, and<br>
anticoagulants or agents for preventing and/or treating<br>
thrombosis or embolism, which comprise such a novel<br>
compound as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In unstable angina, cerebral infarction, cerebral<br>
embolism, myocardial infarction, pulmonary infarction,<br>
pulmonary embolism, Buerger's disease, deep venous<br>
thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation<br>
syndrome, thrombus formation after valve replacement,<br>
reocclusion after angioplasty and thrombus formation<br>
during extracorporeal circulation, hypercoagulable state<br>
is a pivotal factor. Therefore, there is a demand for<br>
development of excellent anticoagulants which have good<br>
dose responsiveness, long duration, low risk of hemorrhage<br>
and little side effects and fast onset of sufficient<br>
effects even by oral administration (Thrombosis Research,<br>
Vol. 68, pp. 507-512, 1992).<br>
Based on the research of anticoagulants worked<br>
through various mechanism of action, it is suggested that<br>
FXa inhibitors are promising anticoagulants. A blood<br>
coagulation system comprises a series of reactions that a<br>
great amount of thrombin is produced through an<br>
amplification process by multi-stage enzyme reactions to<br>
form insoluble fibrin. In an endogenous system, activated<br>
factor IX activates into factor X on a phospholipid<br>
membrane in the presence of activated factor VIII and<br>
calcium ions after multi-stage reactions subsequent to<br>
activation of a contact factor. In an exogenous system,<br>
activated factor VII activates factor X in the presence of<br>
a tissue factor. More specifically, the activation of .the<br>
factor X into FXa in the coagulation system is a crucial<br>
reaction in the formation of thrombin. The activated<br>
factor X (FXa) limitedly decomposes prothrombin to produce<br>
thrombin in the both systems. Since the produced thrombin<br>
activates coagulation factors in the upper stream, the<br>
formation of thrombin is more amplified. As described<br>
above, since the coagulation system in the upper stream of<br>
FXa is divided into the endogenous system and the<br>
exogenous system, production of FXa cannot be sufficiently<br>
inhibited by inhibiting enzymes in the coagulation system<br>
in the upper stream of FXa, leading to production of<br>
thrombin. Since the coagulation system comprises selfamplification<br>
reactions, inhibition of the coagulation<br>
system can be more efficiently achieved by inhibiting FXa<br>
in the upper stream of thrombin than the inhibition of<br>
thrombin (Thrombosis Research, Vol. 15, pp. 617-629,<br>
1979).<br>
An another excellent point of FXa inhibitors is a<br>
great difference between an effective dose in a thrombosis<br>
model and a dose elongating bleeding time in an<br>
experimental hemorrhagic model. From this experimental<br>
result, FXa inhibitors are considered to be anticoagulants<br>
having low risk of hemorrhage.<br>
Various compounds have been reported as FXa<br>
inhibitors. It is known that antithrombin III and<br>
antithrombin III dependent pentasacchrides can generally<br>
not inhibit prothrombinase complexes which play a<br>
practical role in the thrombus formation in a living body<br>
(Thrombosis Research, Vol. 68, pp. 507-512, 1992; Journal<br>
of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 71, pp. 1383-1389, 1983;<br>
Mebio, Vol. 14, the August number, pp. 92-97) . In addition,<br>
they do not exhibit effectiveness by oral administration.<br>
Tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) (Science, Vol. 248, pp.<br>
593-596, 1990) and antistasin (AST) (Journal of Biological<br>
Chemistry, Vol. 263, pp. 10162-10167, 1988) isolated from<br>
mites or leeches, which are bloodsuckers, also inhibit Fxa<br>
and exhibit anti-thrombotic effects against venous<br>
thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. However, these<br>
compounds are high-molecular weight peptides and<br>
unavailable in oral administration. As described above,<br>
development of antithrombin III independent low-molecular<br>
weight FXa inhibitors which directly inhibit coagulation<br>
factors has been conducted.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a novel compound which has a potent FXainhibiting<br>
effect and exhibits an anti-thrombotic effect<br>
quickly, sufficiently and persistently by oral<br>
administration.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have investigated synthesis<br>
and pharmacological effects of novel FXa inhibitors. As a<br>
result, diamine derivatives, salts thereof, and solvates<br>
and N-oxides thereof, which exhibit potent FXa-inhibiting<br>
effect and anticoagulant effect, have been found. It has<br>
also been found that these compounds promptly,<br>
persistently and potently inhibit FXa and exhibit potent<br>
anticoagulant effect and anti-thrombotic effect by oral<br>
administration, and are hence useful as prophylactics and<br>
remedies for various diseases based on thromboembolism,<br>
thus leading to completion of the present invention.<br>

The preparation process of the diamine derivatives<br>
(1) according to the present invention will hereinafter be<br>
described.<br>
 [Preparation Process 1]<br>
A compound represented by the general formula (1), a<br>
salt thereof, a solvate thereof, or an N-oxide thereof can<br>
be prepared in accordance with, for example, the following<br>
process:<br>
Q4-C02H<br>
(3)<br>
HN(RO-Q3-NHR2 — HN(R')-Q3-N(Rz)-T'-Q
(2) (4)<br>

(1)<br>
wherein Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as<br>
defined above, and T1 represents a carbonyl group.<br>
A mixed acid anhydride, acid halide, activated ester<br>
or the like, which is derived from carboxylic acid (3),<br>
may react with diamine (2), giving compound (4). The<br>
resultant compound (4) may react with carboxylic acid (5)<br>
under the same conditions, giving compound (1) according<br>
to the present invention. In the above reaction steps,<br>
reagents and conditions, which are generally used in<br>
peptide synthesis, may be applied. The mixed acid<br>
anhydride can be prepared by, for example, reaction of a<br>
chloroformate such as ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl<br>
chloroformate with carboxylic acid (3) in the presence of<br>
a base. The acid halide can be prepared by treating<br>
carboxylic acid (3) with an acid halide such as thionyl<br>
chloride or oxalyl chloride. The activated ester includes<br>
various kinds of esters. Such an ester can be prepared by,<br>
for example, reaction of a phenol such as p-nitrophenol,<br>
N-hydroxybenzotriazol, or N-hydroxysccinimide with<br>
carboxylic acid (3) using a condensing agent such as N,N'-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(3 -<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. The<br>
activated ester can also be prepared by reaction of<br>
carboxylic acid (3) with pentafluorophenyl<br>
trifluoroacetate or the like, reaction of carboxylic acid<br>
(3) with 1-benzotriazolyloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphite, reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with<br>
diethyl cyanophosphonate (Shioiri method), reaction of<br>
carboxylic acid (3) with triphenylphosphine and 2,2'-<br>
dipyridyl disulfide (Mukaiyama method) or the like. The<br>
thus-obtained mixed acid anhydride, acid halide or<br>
activated ester of carboxylic acid (3) may react with<br>
diamine (2) at -78°C to 150°C in the presence of a proper<br>
base in an inert solvent, giving compound (4). Thusobtained<br>
compound (4) may react with a mixed acid<br>
anhydride, acid halide or activated ester of carboxylic<br>
acid (5) under the same conditions, giving compound (1)<br>
according to the present invention. The reagents and<br>
reaction conditions in the reaction of compound (4) with<br>
carboxylic acid (5) are the same as those in the reaction<br>
of diamine (2) with carboxylic acid (3).<br>

above mentioned step, may be carbonates of alkali metals<br>
or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium carbonate and<br>
potassium carbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium<br>

chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, etheric solvents such<br>
as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and dioxane,<br>

solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,Ndimethylacetamide<br>
and N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. In<br>
addition to these solvent, a sulfoxide solvent such as<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide or sulfolane, a ketone solvent such as<br>
acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or the like may be used in<br>
some cases.<br>

protecting groups may be chosen for use according to the<br>
nature and the like of the compound of which amino group<br>
is to be protected. Upon leaving such a protecting group,<br>
reagents and conditions may be employed according to the<br>
protecting group.<br>

according to the nature of the compound. For example,<br>
azide derivative (18) is hydrogenated at a temperature of<br>
-10°C to 70°C using 1 to 20% palladium carbon as a catalyst<br>
in a proper solvent, whereby compound (7a) can be prepared.<br>
The hydrogen pressure may be raised higher than<br>
atmospheric pressure. As the solvent, an alcoholic solvent<br>
such as methanol or ethanol, an etheric solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or dioxane, an amide<br>
solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,Ndimethylacetamide<br>
or N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, an ester<br>
solvent such as ethyl acetate, acetic acid, hydrochloric<br>
acid, water, a mixed solvent thereof and the like is<br>
suitable.<br>
Optically active amine (7a) prepared in accordance<br>
with the above-described process can be converted to<br>
optically active compound (1) in accordance with the<br>
above-described Preparation Process 2. Antipode (1) of<br>
optically active substance (1) obtained from optically<br>
active amine (7a) may also be prepared in accordance with<br>
a similar process.<br>
Optically active compound (1) may be prepared by<br>
separating racemic compound (1) through a column composed<br>
of an optically active carrier. It is also possible to<br>
separate intermediate (2), (4), (7), (8) or (9) for<br>
preparing racemic compound (1) through a column composed<br>
of an optically active carrier to isolate optically active<br>
intermediate (2), (4), (7), (8) or (9), and then prepare<br>
optically active compound (1) in accordance with any of<br>
Preparation Processes 1 to 4. As a process for isolating<br>
optically active compound (1), optically active<br>
intermediate (2), (4), (7), (8) or (9), a process of<br>
fractionally crystallizing a salt with an optically active<br>
carboxylic acid, or a process of fractionally<br>
crystallizing a salt with an optically active base on the<br>
contrary may be used.<br>
[Preparation Process 7]<br>
Among the compounds (1) according to the present<br>
invention, a preparation process of compound (Ic)<br>
containing heteroatom(s) in the group Q3 will hereinafter<br>
be described in detail.<br>
A compound represented by the general formula (Ic), a<br>
salt thereof, a solvate thereof, or an N-oxide thereof can<br>
be prepared in accordance with, for example, the following<br>
process:<br>
R" Q4-C02H \ A / Q'-CP-CO.H Hv H<br>
AV ... A A (.5..)<br>
 (2c) (4c)<br>
wherein Q1, Qa, Q3, Q4, R3, R4, A, m and n have the same<br>
meanings as defined above, and T1 represents a carbonyl<br>
group.<br>
A mixed acid anhydride, acid halide, activated ester<br>
or the like, which is derived from carboxylic acid (3),<br>
may react with compound (2c), giving compound (4c). The<br>
resultant compound (4c) may react with carboxylic acid (5)<br>
under the same conditions, giving compound (Ic) according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
In the above reaction steps, reagents and conditions,<br>
which are generally used in peptide synthesis, may be<br>
applied. The mixed acid anhydride can be prepared by, for<br>
example, reaction of a chloroformate such as ethyl<br>
chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate with carboxylic<br>
acid (3) in the presence of a base. The acid halide can be<br>
prepared by treating carboxylic acid (3) with an acid<br>
halide such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. The<br>
activated ester includes various kinds of esters. Such an<br>
ester can be prepared by, for example, reaction of a<br>
phenol such as p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxybenzotriazol, or Nhydroxysccinimide<br>
with carboxylic acid (3) using a<br>
condensing agent such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br>
(DCC) or 1-ethyl-3 - (3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride. The activated ester can also be prepared by<br>
reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with pentafluorophenyl<br>
trifluoroacetate or the like, reaction of carboxylic acid<br>
(3) with 1-benzotriazolyloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphite, reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with<br>
diethyl cyanophosphonate (Shioiri method), reaction of<br>
carboxylic acid (3) with triphenylphosphine and 2,2'-<br>
dipyridyl disulfide (Mukaiyama method) or the like. The<br>
thus-obtained mixed acid anhydride, acid halide or<br>
activated ester of carboxylic acid (3) may react with<br>
compound (2c) at a temperature under cooling to a<br>
temperature under heating in the presence of a proper base<br>
in an inert solvent, giving compound (4c). Thus-obtained<br>
compound (4c) may react with a mixed acid anhydride, acid<br>
halide or activated ester of carboxylic acid (5) under the<br>
same conditions, giving compound (Ic) according to the<br>
present invention. The reagents and reaction conditions in<br>
the reaction of compound (4C) with carboxylic acid (5) are<br>
the same as those in the reaction of diamine (2c) with<br>
carboxylic acid (3).<br>
As specific examples of the base used in each of the<br>
above step, may be mentioned carbonates of alkali metals<br>
or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium carbonate and<br>
potassium carbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium<br>
ethoxide and potassium butoxide, alkali metal hydroxides<br>
such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and<br>
hydrides of alkali metals, such as sodium hydride and<br>
potassium hydride; organic metal bases exemplified by<br>
alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium, and organic metal<br>
bases exemplified by dialkylaminolithium such as lithium<br>
diisopropylamide; organic metal bases of bis(silyl)amine,<br>
such as lithium-bis(trimethylsilyl)amide; and organic<br>
bases such as pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine and diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU) or the like.<br>
Examples of the inert solvent used in this reaction<br>
include alkyl halide type solvents such as methylene<br>
chloride and chloroform, etheric solvents such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane, aromatic solvents such as<br>
benzene and toluene, and amide solvents such as N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide. In addition to these solvent, a<br>
sulfoxide solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, a ketone<br>
solvent such as acetone, or the like may be used in some<br>
cases,<br>
In the above-described preparation steps, processes<br>
such as attaching and leaving of a protecting group, and<br>
conversion of a functional group can be suitably applied,<br>
thereby preparing compound (Ic).<br>
As the protecting group for amino group, it is only<br>
necessary to use a protecting group, which is generally<br>
used as a protecting group for amino group in syntheses of<br>
organic compounds, particularly, peptide synthesis. As<br>
examples thereof, may be mentioned alkoxycarbonyl groups<br>
such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl and<br>
ethoxycarbonyl groups, arylmethoxycarbonyl groups such as<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and p- or onitrobenzyloxycarbonyl<br>
group, arylmethyl groups such as<br>
benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl and triphenylmethyl groups,<br>
alkanoyl groups such as formyl and acetyl groups, aroyl<br>
groups such as a benzoyl group, and arylsulfonyl groups<br>
such as 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl and o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl<br>
groups.<br>
As the protecting group for hydroxyl group, it is<br>
only necessary to use a protecting group for hydroxyl<br>
group, which is generally used in syntheses of organic<br>
compounds. As examples thereof, may be mentioned<br>
alkoxymethyl groups such as a methoxymethyl group,<br>
arylmethyl groups such as benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl,<br>
triphenylmethyl groups, alkanoyl groups such as an acetyl<br>
group, aroyl groups such as a benzoyl group, and a tertbutyldiphenylsilyloxy<br>
group. A carboxyl group can be<br>
protected as an ester with an alkyl group such as a methyl<br>
group, ethyl group, tert-butyl group or an arylmethyl<br>
group such as a benzyl group. The attaching and leaving of<br>
the protecting group may be conducted in accordance with a<br>
method known per se in the art.<br>
Compound (Ic) according to the present invention can<br>
be converted into various derivatives by converting its<br>
functional group. For example, a compound in which A<br>
is a nitrogen atom having no substituent can be<br>
converted into an amide compound by acylation using a<br>
mixed acid anhydride, acid halide, activated ester or the<br>
like in accordance with ordinary organic chemical methods,<br>
a sulfonamide compound by reaction with a sulfonyl halide,<br>
an N-alkyl compound by reaction with an alkyl halide, an<br>
N-aryl compound by reaction with an aryl halide or a<br>
carbamate compound by reaction with an isocyanate.<br>
Incidentally, the compound in which A is a nitrogen<br>
atom having no substituent can be prepared by, for<br>
example, treating compound (Ic) prepared from diamine<br>
(2c), in which A has been protected with tertbutoxycarbonyl<br>
group, in accordance with Preparation<br>
Process 7 with an acid.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention<br>
thus prepared can be isolated and purified by publicly<br>
known methods, for example, extraction, precipitation,<br>
fractional chromatography, fractional crystallization,<br>
recrystallization, etc. The compounds according to the<br>
present invention can be converted into desired salts in<br>
accordance with ordinary salt-forming reactions.<br>
Optical isomers derived from an asymmetric carbon<br>
atom are present in the compounds of the present invention,<br>
Such an optically active isomer can be prepared by the<br>
process of preparing from optically active diamine (2c),<br>
and besides, a process of forming an optically active<br>
amine or acid and a salt from racemic compound (Ic) and<br>
fractionally crystallizing it, a process of separating it<br>
by column chromatography using an optically active carrier.<br>
Compound (Ic), in which T1 is a sulfonyl group, can<br>
be prepared by changing carboxylic acid (3) to sulfonyl<br>
halide (10) in the reaction of compound (2c) with<br>
carboxylic acid (3).<br>
[Preparation Process 8]<br>
Compound (Ic) according to the present invention can<br>
also be prepared in accordance with the following process:<br>

wherein Q1, Q2, Q4, R3, R4, A, m and n have the same<br>
meanings as defined above, T1 represents a carbonyl group,<br>
and R51 and R61 represent protecting groups for amino<br>
group.<br>
Compound (21) can be prepared by removing the<br>
protecting group R61 of compound (19) obtained by<br>
protecting the amino groups of compound (2c). No<br>
particular limitation is imposed on the protecting groups<br>
for amino acid illustrated as R51 and R61 so far as they are<br>
groups generally used in protection of the amino group.<br>
However, as typical examples thereof, may be mentioned the<br>
protecting groups for amino group described in Preparation<br>
Process 7. In this case, R51 and R61 are required to be<br>
protecting groups capable of leaving by different methods<br>
or conditions from each other. As typical examples thereof,<br>
may be mentioned a combination that R51 is a tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl group, and R61 is a benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
These protecting groups may be chosen for use according to<br>
the nature and the like of the compound of which amino<br>
groups are to be protected. Upon leaving such a protecting<br>
group, reagents and conditions may be employed according<br>
to the protecting group.<br>
Compound (21) can also be prepared by converting the<br>
hydroxyl group in aminoalcohol derivative (20) into an<br>
amino group. As an example of the preparation of<br>
aminoalcohol derivative (20), is known conversion of<br>
methionine into 3-hydroxy-4-aminothiopyrane-1,1-dioxide<br>
(Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 37, p. 7457, 1996) or the like.<br>
As a process for converting the hydroxyl group in<br>
aminoalcohol derivative (20) into an amino group, may be<br>
mentioned a process in which aminoalcohol derivative (20)<br>
may react with methanesulfonyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl<br>
chloride, trifluorome?thanesulfonic anhydride or the like,<br>
the resultant product may then react with ammonia, a<br>
primary arylalkylamine such as benzylamine, pmethoxybenzylamine<br>
or 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, a<br>
secondary arylalkylamine such as dibenzylamine, or a<br>
hydroxylamine such as N-benzylhydroxylamine or N,Odibenzylhydroxylamine,<br>
and benzyl group or the like is<br>
then removed as needed, thereby preparing diamine (21).<br>
Aminoalcohol derivative (20) can also be converted into<br>
diamine (21) by reacting it with phthalimide or<br>
succinirnide in accordance with the reaction with<br>
triphenylphosphine and ethyl azodicarboxylate (Mukaiyama<br>
method) or the like, and then treating the reaction<br>
product with hydrazine, N-methylhydrazine or the like.<br>
When A in the formula is S02, and n is 0, diamine (21) can<br>
be prepared by adding ammonia, a primary arylalkylamine<br>
such as ammonia, benzylamine, p-methoxybenzylamine or 2,4-<br>
dimethoxybenzylamine, a secondary arylalkylamine such as<br>
dibenzylamine, or a hydroxylamine such as Nbenzylhydroxylamine<br>
or N,O-dibenzylhydroxylamine to an<br>
a, (3-unsaturated cyclic sulfone formed by reacting<br>
aminoalcohol derivative (20) with methanesulfonyl chloride,<br>
p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
anhydride or the like and then treating the reaction<br>
product with a proper base or directly reacting<br>
aminoalcohol derivative (20) with triphenylphosphine and<br>
ethyl azodicarboxylate, and removing the benzyl group or<br>
the like as needed.<br>
The resultant diamine (21) may react with carboxylic<br>
acid (3), giving compound (22) . The protecting group R51<br>
is successively removed, giving compound (4c). Compound<br>
(4c) may react with carboxylic acid (5), giving compound<br>
(Ic) according to the present invention. The reagents and<br>
reaction conditions in the reaction of compound (21) with<br>
carboxylic acid (3) and the reaction of compound (4C) with<br>
carboxylic acid (5) may be the same as those described in<br>
Preparation Process 7.<br>
Similarly, compound (Ic) in which T1 is a sulfonyl<br>
group can be prepared by changing carboxylic acid (3) to<br>
sulfonyl halide (10) in the reaction of compound (21) with<br>
carboxylic acid (3) .<br>

As preparation processes of diol derivative (23), are<br>
known, for example, conversion of 1,2,3,6-<br>
tetrahydropyridine into 1-benzyloxycarbonyl-3,4-cisdihydroxypyrrolidine<br>
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-<br>
Open No. 138264/1995), conversion of L-tartaric acid into<br>
(R,R)-tetrahydrofurandiol or (R,R)-N-benzylpyrrolidinediol<br>
(Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, Vol. 8, p. 1861, 1997) and the<br>
like. Diol derivative (23) can be prepared by using such<br>
an already known process or applying such a process and<br><br>
removing a protecting group or converting a functional<br>
group as needed.<br>
Diol derivative (23) may react with methanesulfonyl<br>
chloride at a temperature under cooling to room<br>
temperature in the presence of a base in an inert solvent,<br>
giving compound (24). The inert solvent may be suitably<br>
chosen for use from those described in Preparation Process<br>
7 . However, particularly preferred are alkyl halide type<br>
solvents such as methylene chloride and chloroform, and<br>
etheric solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane.<br>
As the base, is preferred an organic base such as pyridine,<br>
2, 6 -lutidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, Nmethylmorpholine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine or diazabicyclo-<br>
[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).<br>
Compound (24) may react with sodium azide at a<br>
temperature under cooling to a temperature under heating<br>
in a proper solvent, giving azide derivative (25). As the<br>
solvent, an amide solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidin-2- one, an alcoholic solvent such as<br>
methanol or ethanol, an etheric solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, aromatic solvent such as<br>
benzene or toluene, a carbon halogenide such as methylene<br>
chloride or chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, or<br>
the like is suitable. Such a .solvent may be a mixed<br>
solvent with water.<br>
As a process for converting azide derivative (25)<br>
into compound (2c), there are many processes such as a<br>
process of conducting hydrogenation with a palladium<br>
catalyst, Raney nickel catalyst or platinum catalyst, a<br>
reaction using a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum<br>
hydride or sodium borohydride, a reaction using zinc in<br>
the presence of nickel chloride or cobalt chloride, and a<br>
reaction using triphenylphosphine ot the like. Suitable<br>
reagents and reaction conditions may be selected according<br>
to the nature of the compound. The hydrogen pressure may<br>
be raised higher than atmospheric pressure. As the solvent,<br>
an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, an<br>
etheric solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, an<br>
amide solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or Nmethylpyrrolidin-<br>
2-one, an ester solvent such as ethyl<br>
acetate, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, water, a mixed<br>
solvent thereof or the like is suitable. Compound (Ic)<br>
according to the present invention can be derived from<br>
diamine derivative (2c) prepared in accordance with the<br>
above-described process in accordance with Preparation<br>
Process 7.<br>
When diol derivative (23) is trans-3,4-<br>
dihydroxytetrahydrofuran or trans-1-substituted 3,4-<br>
dihydroxypyrrolidine and the like, optically active<br>
substances are present. These optically active diol<br>
derivatives (23) can be converted into optically active<br>
diamine derivatives (2c) , and further into optically<br>
active compounds (Ic) according to the present invention<br>
in accordance with Preparation Process 7.<br><br>
[Preparation Process 10]<br>
A typical preparation process of optically active<br>
compounds (30), (31) and (32) included in compound (19)<br>

Optically active a, (3-unsaturated ester derivative<br>
(26) can be prepared in accordance with the process<br>
described in literature (J. Org. Chem., Vol. 61, p. 581,<br>
1996; J. Org. Chem., Vol. 57, p. 6279, 1992, etc.) or by<br>
applying such a process. Optically active a, p-unsaturated<br>
ester derivative (26) may react with an amine at a<br>
temperature under cooling, or under heating in a proper<br>
solvent, giving diastereomers (27a) and (27b). The amine<br>
may be suitably chosen for use from those described in<br>
Preparation Process 8. The solvent is desirably an organic<br>
solvent unreactive to a substrate, product or reagent,<br>
particularly, an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or<br>
ethanol, or an etheric solvent such as tetrahydrofuran,<br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane and the like.<br>
Diastereomers (27a) and (27b) can also be prepared by<br>
reaction of a, (3-unsaturated ester derivative (26) with an<br>
organometallic base such as lithium N-benzyl-<br>
(trimethylsilyl)amide and the like by applying the process<br>
described in literature (J. Org. Chero., Vol. 63, p. 7263,<br>
1998) . The diastereomers may be separated to use, for<br>
example, diastereomer (27a) in the next reaction.<br>
Compound (27a) is treated with an acid at a<br>
temperature under cooling, or under heating in a proper<br>
solvent, giving compound (28). Examples of the acid used<br>
include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, Lewis acids such<br>
as boron trifluoride, trifluoroacetic acid, ptoluenesulfonic<br>
acid or the like. As the solvent, is used<br>
water or an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
Such a solvent may be a mixed solvent with water. In this<br>
reaction, the protecting group R61 may be left in some<br>
cases. In such a case, such a compound is required to<br>
react with a proper protecting reagent for amino group as<br>
needed.<br>
Compound (28) may be treated with an acid at a<br>
temperature under cooling, or under heating in a proper<br>
solvent, giving optically active compound (30) . The acid<br>
used may be suitably chosen for use from the acids<br>
mentioned above, with a Lewis acid such as boron<br>
trifluoride, or p-toluenesulfonic acid or the like being<br>
particularly preferred. As the solvent used in the<br>
reaction, is used an etheric solvent such as 1,4-dioxane<br>
or tetrahydrofuran, or an aromatic solvents such as<br>
benzene or toluene. Compound (30) can also be prepared<br>
from azide derivative (29). As examples of the preparation<br>
of optically active azide derivative (29), are known<br>

4 -azide-5-oxotetrahydrofuran (Can. J. Chem., Vol. 71, p.<br>
1047, 1993) and the like. Optically active azide<br>
derivative (29) can be prepared by using such an already<br>
known process or applying such a process and removing a<br>
protecting group or converting a functional group as<br>
needed. The azide in azide derivative (29) may be reduced<br>
into an amino group, and the resultant product may react<br>
with a proper protecting reagent for amino group, giving<br>
compound (30). The reagents and reaction conditions used<br>
in the reduction of azide (29) may be the same as those<br>
described in the process of converting azide derivative<br>
(25) into compound (2c).<br>
The hydroxyl group portion of compound (28) may be<br>
converted into an amino group and then treated with a base,<br>
giving compound (31) . The conversion of the hydroxyl group<br>
in compound (28) into the amino group can be performed in<br>
accordance with, for example, Preparation Process 8.<br>
Compound (31) can also be prepared by treating alcohol<br>
derivative (28) with an oxidizing agent and then<br>
reductively aminating the resultant aldehyde derivative.<br>
Specific preferable examples of the oxidizing agent used<br>
in the above reaction include pyridinium chlorochromate<br>
(PCC), pyridinium dichromate (PDC), sulfur trioxide<br>
pyridine complexes or the like. Example of the amine<br>
include primary alkylamines such as ammonia, methylamine<br>
and ethylamine, and primary arylalkylamine such as<br>
benzylamine, p-methoxybenzylamine and 2,4-<br>
dimethoxybenzylamine. As the reducing process, there are a<br>
process of conducting hydrogenation with a palladium<br>
catalyst, Raney nickel catalyst or platinum catalyst, a<br>
reaction using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride,<br>
sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride,<br>
and suitable reagents and reaction conditions may be<br>
selected according to the nature of the compound or the<br>
like. The base used in the above process may be suitably<br>
chosen for use from those described in Preparation Process<br>
7. Compound (31) can also be prepared by using compound<br>
(30) and an amine in accordance with the .process described<br>
in literature (Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 41, p. 1141, 2000;<br>
Heterocycles, Vol. 53, p. 173, 2000) or by applying such a<br>
process. Examples of the amine used include primary<br>
alkylamines such as ammonia, methylamine and ethylamine,<br>
and primary arylalkylamine such as benzylamine and pmethoxybenzyl-<br>
amine.<br>
Compound (31) may be treated with a reducing agent at<br>
a temperature under cooling to a temperature under heating<br>
in a solvent, giving compound (32). Examples of the<br>
reducing agent include borane•tetrahydrofuran complexes,<br>
borane•methyl sulfide complexes, lithium aluminum hydride.<br>
However, suitable reagents and reaction conditions may be<br>
selected according to the nature of the compound or the<br>
like. The solvent is desirably an organic solvent<br>
unreactive to a substrate, product, reagentor the like,<br>
particularly, an etheric solvent such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
or 1,4-dioxane.<br>
Optically active substances (Ic) of the compounds<br>
according to the present invention can be derived from the<br>
compounds (30), (31) and (32) prepared by the processes<br>
described above.<br>
In the above-described preparation scheme, one of<br>
optically active substances has been described by way of<br>

the blood (0.5 ml) was collected through the jugular vein<br>
using a syringe which is containing a 3.13% (w/v) aqueous<br>
solution (50 pi) of trisodium citrate dihydrate (amount of<br>
blood collected: 0.45 ml). For rats of a control group,<br>
the same blood collection was conducted after a 0.5% MC<br>
solution was administered. Each blood sample was<br>
centrifuged at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate<br>
plasma, and the plasma was preserved at -40°C until it was<br>
used in the following determination of anti-FXa activity<br>
in plasma.<br>
(B) Determination of FXa-inhibiting activity in plasma:<br>
In the determination of anti-FXa activity in plasma,<br>
S-2222 was used as a substrate. Tris buffer (100 mM Tris,<br>
200 mM potassium chloride, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4) (5456 ul),<br>
human FXa (2.5 U/ml, 44 ul) and water (550 ul) were mixed.<br>
The resultant human FXa solution was used in the following<br>
test.<br>
Rat plasma (5 ul) obtained in accordance with the<br>
procedure (A) described above was put in wells of a 96-<br>
well microplate, and the above-described human FXa<br>
solution (55 ul) and a 750 uM aqueous solution (40 ul) of<br>
S-2222 were sequentially added. Immediately after that,<br>
absorbance at 405 nm was measured at room temperature by<br>
means of a spectrophotometer SPECTRAmax 340 or 190<br>
(Molecular Devices Co., U.S.A.), thereby determining a<br>
rate of reaction (AOD/min).<br>
The anti-FXa activity, i.e., percent inhibition (%)<br>
was calculated in accordance with the following equation:<br>
Percent inhibition (%) =<br>
[1 - (AOD/min of sample) + (average value of AOD/min of<br>
the control group)] x 100<br>
(Result)<br>
The compounds described in Examples 63, 191, 192,<br>
