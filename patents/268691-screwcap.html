Screwcap<br>
The invention concerns a screwcap from plastic material vWth a cover disc and an external cover edge perpendtculariy adjoining its circumference with an internal thread to close a filling and/or discharging socket of a container for the transport and storage of liquids as well as with a central bung socket provided countersunk in the cover disc with internal thread to screw in the bung plug.<br>
From EP 0 650 446 Bl screv\/caps of the generic type are known for closing the filling socket of a drum with bung or the plastic inner container of a pallet container with an external jacket from grate rods or sheet metal have the disadvantage that the sealing ring to seal the bung plug in the bung socket of the screwcap no longer assures the sealing of the bung plug closure due to the ageing of the material of the sealing ring, in particular of containers used for transport and storage of chemical liquids, so that the sealing ring has to be regularly replaced.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the screwcap of the generic type with regard to an improved sealing of the bung plug closure, a more cost-effective manufacture as well as to lower the operating expenses of the container for liquid fitted with the screwcap and used as multiple use container.<br>
According to the invention this objective is achieved by a screwcap according to the features of patent claims 1, 7 and 8.<br>
The sub-claims contain advantageous and useful developments of the invention.<br>
The screwcap according to the invention with a bung socket, that is fitted with a bung plug closure, is characterised by the following advantages:<br>
'I The design of the plastic bung plug for closing the bung socket of the screwcap with a tapered multiple seal integrally injection moulded with it in the form of sealing rings spaced from one another, which in the case of a screwed-in bung plug are pressed against a tapered internal sealing surface of the bung plug,<br><br>
makes an optimum sealing of the bung plug closure possible. In the case of containers with internal pressure the sealing of the bung plug closure for the bung socket of the screvv'cap is further improved by that the pressure of the sealing rings of the tapered multiple seal of the plug, brought about by the screv^'ing in of the bung plug, against the tapered internal sealing surface of the bung socket is additionally increased due to the internal pressure of the container acting on the internal wall of the sealing end of the bung plug with the multiple sealing of the screw-in sleeve. Due to the absence of a sealing ring, that.has to be regularly replaced, the manufacturing expenses can be reduced in comparison with known screwcaps with a bung socket that is closed by a bung plug with a sealing ring, as v^^ell as the operating expenses of the container for liquid that is fitted with a screwcap with the new bung plug closure for the bung socket of the cover which are used as multiple use containers.<br>
In the following the invention is explained based on the figures of the drawing which show the following in:<br>
Fig.1 ~ a longitudinal section of a screwcap with a central bung socket that is enclosed by a bung plug, and<br>
Fig.2 - an enlarged detailed illustration of the screwcap of Fig.1, and the<br>
Figs.3 and 4 - enlarged detailed illustrations of two further embodiments of the screwcap.<br>
The screwcap 1, manufactured from plastic as an injection moulded part, has a flat cover disc 2, an external cover edge 3 perpendicularly adjoining its circumference with an internal thread 4 to close a filling and/or discharging socket of a container for the transport and storage of liquids, as well as an inner skirt 5. The inner skirt 5 is concentrically arranged with the external cover edge 3, form with it a sealing bed 6 to insert a sealing ring to seal the screwcap 1 on the upper edge of the filling and/or discharging socket of the container for liquids and serves the purpose of reinforcement as well as of a better seatof the screwcap on the socket of the container.<br><br>
In the cover disc 2 a central bung socket 7 is provided in a countersunk manner; said bung socket can be closed by a bung plug 8 manufactured as an injection moulded plastic part.<br>
The bung plug 8 is fitted with a cylindrical screv\/-in sleeve 9 with an external thread 10 for screwing it into the threaded bore 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1, The screw-in sleeve 9 of the bung plug 8 has a sealing end 12, onto which a tapered multiple seal 13 is moulded that is formed by four sealing rings 14 with a rounded sealing edge 14a, said sealing rings spaced from one another by grooves 15 and concentrically provided with the longitudinal axis 16-16 of the plug and the diameters 17 of which are reducing in the direction a of screwing in the bung plug 8.<br>
In the case of a screwed-in bung plug 8 the sealing rings 14 of the tapered multiple seal 13 at the sealing end 12 of the bung plug 8 are pressed against a corresponding tapered interna! sealing surface 18 of a sealing neck 19 adjoining the threaded bore 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1.<br>
In the case of a further embodiment of the screwcap 1 a ventilation device or a )     ventilation and aeration device is integrated in the bung plug 8.<br>
To fill a single container through the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1 screwed on the filler socket of the container the bung plug 8 is unscrewed manually from the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1 using a bung wrench and a pump is connected 5 to the bung socket. When filling a plurality of containers through the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1 screwed on the filler socket of the container using automatic filling equipment, the bung plugs 7 are unscrewed from the screwcaps 1 by a machine.<br>
D     The bung plug 8 of a further embodiment of the screwcap, illustrated in Fig.3, has a cylindrical screw-in sleeve 9 with an external thread 10 to be screwed into the threaded hole 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1 as well as with a sealing end 12, said sealing end having an integrally formed sealing ring 14 that has a rounded sealing edge 14a, that in the case of a screwed in bung plug 8 is<br><br>
pressed against a tapered internal sealing surface 18 of a sealing neck 19 adjoining the threaded bpre 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1.<br>
The bung plug 8 of a further emibodiment of the screv^'cap, iilustrated in Fig.4, has a cylindrical screw-in sleeve 9 with an external thread 10 to be screwed into the threaded bore 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screv\/cap 1 as well as with a sealing end 12 having a tapered sealing edge 20 that with the bung plug 8 screwed in is pressed against a tapered infernal sealing surface 18 of a sealing neck 19 adjoining the threaded bore 11 of the bung socket 7 of the screwcap 1.<br><br>
