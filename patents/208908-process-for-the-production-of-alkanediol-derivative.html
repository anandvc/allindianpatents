Process for Production of Alkanediol Derivative<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing an alkanediol derivative-<br>
Background Art<br>
Alkanediol derivatives represented by the following general formula (II):<br><br>
and, in particular, optically active (R) - or (S)-alkanediol derivatives are useful as a building block for agrochemical or pharmaceutical. For obtaining such a derivative, there has been known a process which comprises reducing a hydroxy carboxylic  acid  ester   (e.g.   an  optically  active  2-<br><br>
hydroxypropanoate or an optically active 3-hydroxybutanoate) or a compound obtained by protecting the hydroxyl group of the above ester with dihydropyran or the like^ using lithium aluminum hydride or sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride -<br>
The above lithium aluminum hydride and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride^ however, are difficult to handle in a large amount industrially from the safety standpoint. Therefore, active investigations have been made on a process for conducting the above-mentioned reduction using sodium borohydride which is easy to handle industrially-<br>
However, it is generally impossible to reduce ester group to alcohol group using sodium borohydride [Tetrahedron, Vol-35, p.567 (1979)]. Hence, various reaction conditions have long been studied. For example, there were proposed a process which comprises conducting the reaction in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminum chloride) [J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol.78, p.2582 (1956)] and a process which comprises conducting the reaction in the presence of a metal salt  (e.g.  lithium chloride,  lithium bromide or potassium<br><br>
bromide) [J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol.77, p.6209 (1955)].<br>
There were also proposed a process which comprises suspending sodium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran or tertiary butyl alcohol and slowly adding thereto a primary alcohol (e.g. methanol) under refluxing [Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., Vol.57, p.1948 (1984)], a process using a mixed solvent of an ether type solvent and a primary alcohol [Synlett., p.1636 (1999): WO 98/8793], a process using a polyethylene glycol as a solvent (JP-A-10-507996), a process using a mixed solvent of 1,2-dichloroethane and methanol (JP-A-1-250369), etc.<br>
However, in obtaining an alkanediol derivative represented by the above general formula (II) by conducting reduction according to any of the above known processes, there are various problems. That is, for example, in the processes using a Lewis acid or a metal salt, the Lewis acid or the metal salt added results in an increase in the amount of waste material, which is not preferred; and in the process of dropwise adding a primary alcohol under refluxing, a large amount of hydrogen is generated rapidly when the process is carried out on a large scale, which is dangerous.  In view of<br><br>
that solvent recovery is necessary in an industrial application of the above processes using a solvent, the process using an ether type solvent has a problem of requiring special facilities for ether separation from alcohol as well as for security against peroxide, and the use of 1,2~dichloroethane is restricted for its ozone depletion and global warming.<br>
Thus, in the technical field to which the present invention belongs, no proposal has been made on a process for producing an alkanediol derivative represented by the general formula (II) safely without giving rise to racemization, an-d development of such a process has been desired.<br>
The present invention aims at solving the above-mentioned problems and providing a novel and efficient process for producing an (R)-, (S)- or (RS)-alkanediol derivative which is useful as a building block.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to achieve the above aim, the present inventors made a study on a process for producing an alkanediol derivative represented by the general formula (II)<br><br>
by reducing a corresponding ester compound with sodium boro-hydride. As a result^ it was found out surprisingly that the above ester compound is reduced with sodium borohydride at room temperature in a mixed solvent of a non-polar aprotic solvent/, i.e. an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. chlorobenzene or toluene) ,    an aliphatic hydrocarbon (e.g,. hexane or heptane) , an alicyclic hydrocarbon (e.g. cyclohexane or methylcyclohex-ane) or the like and a primary alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol) and is converted to an alkanediol derivative of the general formula (II) at a high yield without giving rise to racemization when the ester compound is optically active. The present invention has been completed based on the above finding.   Incidentally,  that the ester group of the ester compound is reduced to an alcohol with sodium borohydride at room temperature in a non-polar solvent with an addition of a primary alcohol, is an entirely novel finding which is far beyond the anticipation of those skilled in the art.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention is described in detail be<br><br>
low.<br>
The present invention provides the following inventions [1] and [2].<br>
[1] A process for producing an alcohol derivative represented by the following general formula (II):<br><br>
(wherein R^ and R"^ are each independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; X is a hydrogen atom or a protecting group for hydroxy1 group; and n is 0 or 1), which process comprises reducing an ester compound represented by the following general formula (I):<br><br>
(wherein R1 is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and R2 R3, X and n have the same definitions as given above) with sodium borohydride in a mixed solvent of at least one<br><br>
kind of solvent selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and alicyclic hydrocarbons and a primary alcohol.<br>
[2]   A process  according to  the  above  [1], wherein the primary alcohol is methanol -<br>
First, description is made on the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) which is used as a raw material in the present invention.<br>
In the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) which is used as a raw material in the present process, the substituent represented by R1 in the general formula (I) is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, exemplified by methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, iso-propyl group, n-butyl group and isobutyl group; and the sub-stituents represented by R^ and R^ are each independently a hydrogen atom or, similarly to R1 an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The substituent represented by X in the general formula (I) is a hydrogen atom or a protecting group for hy-<br><br>
droxyl group; and n is 0 or 1, indicating that the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) includes a compound wherein hydroxy1 group is adjacent to carboxyl group and a compound wherein a carbon atom is present between hy-droxyl group and carboxyl group.<br>
Accordingly, as the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom, there can be mentioned, for example, methyl (R)-lactate, ethyl (R)-lactate, isobutyl (R)-lactate, methyl (S)-lactate, ethyl (S)-lactate, methyl (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate, methyl (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate and methyl (S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate or the like.<br>
As the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a protecting group for hydroxy1 group, there can be mentioned, for example, compounds obtained by protecting the hydroxy1 group of a compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom, such as methyl (R)-lactate, ethyl (R)-lactate, isobutyl (R)-lactate, methyl (S)-lactate, ethyl (S)-lactate, methyl (R)-3-<br><br>
hydroxybutanoate, methyl (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate, methyl (S) -3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate or the like, according to a conventional method.<br>
The protecting group for hydroxy1 group, used in the present invention is preferably a group which can be removed under an acidic condition, such as substituted methyl group, substituted ethyl group or the like. The substituted methyl group can be exemplified by methoxymethyl group (MOM) and 2-methoxyethoxymethyl (MEM) group, and the substituted ethyl group can be exemplified by tetrahydropyranyl group and (Ci.g alkoxy) ethyl groups such as 1-ethoxyethyl group, 1~ isobutoxyethyl group and the like.<br>
The use of these protecting groups is described in detail in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis-3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1999)". In the present invention, by protecting hydroxy1 group according to a conventional method described in the above literature, it is possible to obtain an ester compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a protecting group for hydroxy1 group; it is also possible to re-<br><br>
move, as necessary, the protecting group for hydroxyl group.<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a substituted ethyl group, can be obtained by reacting a compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom, with an alkyl vinyl ether in a solvent-free state or in an appropriate solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst.<br>
The alkyl vinyl ether can be exemplified by dihy-dropyran, ethyl vinyl ether, propyl vinyl ether, isobutyl vinyl ether and cyclohexyl vinyl ether. These compounds are on the market and also available industrially.<br>
As the acid catalyst, there are used organic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid, para-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and the like; inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride and the like; pyridinium para-toluenesulfonate; phosphorous oxychloride; and so forth. The amount of the acid catalyst used is not critical but is 0.5 to 10 mole %, preferably 1 to 3 mole % relative to the compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the<br><br>
substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom.<br>
As the solvent which may be used in the reaction for protection of hydroxy1 group, there can be used any solvent which can dissolve the compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom but does not react with the compound represented by the general formula  (I)  wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom.  There can be preferably mentioned, for example, aromatic, aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents  such  as  toluene,  xylene^  cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, octane, heptane and the like.  The amount of the solvent used is not restricted but is 0.3 to 2.0 liters, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 liters per mole of the compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein the substituent represented by X is a hydrogen atom-Next, description is made on the process of the present invention wherein an ester compound represented by the general formula (1) is reduced to an alkanediol derivative represented by the general formula (II).<br>
The reaction of the present process can be con-<br><br>
ducted simply by mixing an ester compound represented by	the<br>
general formula (I),  sodium borohydride and a solvent	and<br>
stirring the resulting mixture.  There is no particular	re<br>
striction as to the addition order of these substances -<br>
The solvent used in the above reaction is a mixed solvent of at least one kind selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and all-cyclic hydrocarbons and a primary alcohol.<br>
As the aromatic hydrocarbons, there can be mentioned, for example, chlorobenzene, toluene, 4-chlorotoluene, 2-chlorotoluene, 2,4-dichlorotoluene, naphthalene and 1-chloronaphthalene; as the aliphatic hydrocarbons, there can be mentioned, for example, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and isooctane; and as the allcyclic hydrocarbons, there can be mentioned, for example, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane.<br>
The solvent selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons and allcyclic hydrocarbons can be one kind or two or more kinds (in this case, there is no particular restriction as to their mixing proportions).  The amount of the solvent used is not particu-<br><br>
larly restricted and is 0.3 to 2.0 liters, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 liters per mole of the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) .<br>
As the primary alcohol to be mixed with the above hydrocarbon solvent to constitute a mixed solvent used in the above-mentioned reaction, there can be mentioned, for example, methanol and ethanol. Methanol is preferred for the high reaction rate. The primary alcohol is used in an amount of 3 to 12 equivalents, preferably 5 to 8 equivalents relative to the ester compound represented by the general formula (I) ; however, the amount used is not restricted thereto.<br>
Meanwhile, the amount of sodium borohydride used is 1 to 6 equivalents, preferably 1 to 3 equivalents, more preferably 1.3 to 2.0 equivalents relative to the ester compound represented by the general formula (I); however, the amount used is not restricted thereto.<br>
The above reaction proceeds smoothly at a reaction temperature of 0 to 80°C, preferably 20 to 40°C and, in particular, stirring at room temperature is simple and gives a high yield.<br><br>
In the reaction of the present process, there can be employed various specific procedures; for example, a procedure in which an ester compound represented by the general formula (I) and sodium borohydride are suspended or dissolved in toluene, methanol is added dropwise thereto at room temperature, and, in this state, stirring is conducted up to the completion of a reaction, or a procedure in which a methanol solution of an ester compound represented by the general formula (I) is added at room temperature to a toluene suspension of sodium borohydride.<br>
After the completion of the reaction, the reaction product is isolated by an ordinary extraction operation and purified by distillation, or water is added to the reaction mixture to remove the alcohol so that the reaction product dissolved in toluene can be used per se in the next reaction .<br>
O'f the ester compounds represented by the general formula (I) , the alkoxyethyl group-protected (R) - or (S)-propionic acid esters represented by the following general formula (III), excluding some compounds, are not described in<br><br>
Chemical Abstract and are novel compounds whose properties are unknown,<br><br>
[wherein X1 is a (C1.6 alkoxy) ethyl group, and R has the same definition as the above-mentioned R1 ] .<br>
As such novel (C1-6 alkoxy) ethyl group-protected (R)- or (S)-propionic acid esters represented by the general formula (III) , there can be specifically mentioned, for exam--pie, isobutyl (R)-2-(l~ethoxyethoxy)propionate, isobutyl (R)-2- (1-isobutoxyethoxy)propionate, methyl (R)-2-(1-isobutoxy-ethoxy)propionate, isobutyl (R)-2-(1-n-butoxyethoxy)-propionate and isobutyl (R)-2-(1-cyclohexyloxy-ethoxy)propionate.<br>
The alkoxyethyl group used as a protecting group for hydroxy1 group in the compound represented by the general formula (III), as compared with tetrahydropyranyl group, is removable under milder conditions and therefore is known to<br><br>
hardly cause racemization  in the  reaction  for protecting group removal in optically active compound.  In, for example, S. Chladek and J. Smrt., Chem. &amp; Ind. (London), 1719 (1964), it is described that while racemization takes place partially in the removal of tetrahydropyranyl group, no racemization takes place in the removal of ethoxyethyl group.<br>
Of the alkanediol derivatives represented by the general formula (II) , the 1^ 2-propanediol derivatives represented by the following general formula (IV)^ other than some compounds, are novel compounds not described in Chemical Abstract .<br><br>
(wherein X1 has the same definition as given above).<br>
As such novel 1,2-propanediol derivatives represented by the general formula (IV), there can be specifically mentioned, for example (R)-2- (1-isobutoxyethoxy)-1-propanol, (S)-2- (1-isobutoxyethoxy)-1-propanol,  (R)-2-(1-n-butoxyetho-xy)-1-propanol and (R)-2-(1-cyclohexyloxyethoxy)-1-propanol.<br>

Example 20<br>
(R)-(-)-1,2-propanediol<br>
In 250 ml of toluene were placed 61.5 g (0.42 mole) of isobutyl (R)-(+)-lactate and 11.5 g (0.305 mole) of<br><br>
sodium borohydride.  Thereto was dropwise added 54 g (1.69 moles) of methanol at room temperature with stirring so that the internal temperature of the reaction system could be kept at 40°C or less.  Stirring was conducted at room temperature and, after 2 hours, the disappearance of the raw material was confirmed by GC.  To the reaction mixture was added 50 ml of methanol, and stirring was conducted at room temperature for 1 hour to deactivate the remaining sodium borohydride.  To the reaction mixture was dropwise added a 35% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution for neutralization to pH 7.3.  The resulting material was filtered through Celite.  The toluene layer as filtrate was subjected to vacuum distillation.  The residue was subjected to distillation at a boiling point of 111*^0/5.3 KPa to obtain 18.3 g (yield: 78.9%) of (R)-(-)-l,2-propanediol.<br>
[a]D26: -21.9° (c-7.5, H2O) [Reference Value in Synthesis, 142 (1984), [a]D25:   -20.1° (c=8, H2O) ] The NMR and IR spectrum were identical with those of the standard racemic compound. Example 21<br><br>
(S)-( + )-1, 2-propanediol<br>
In 250 ml of cyclohexane were placed 44.4 g (0.42 mole) of methyl (S)-(-)-lactate (98.4% e.e) and 11.5 g (0.305 mole) of sodium borohydride. A reaction and a treatment were conducted in the same manner as in Example 20. By distillation was obtained 19.2 g (83%) of (S)- ( + )-1,2-propanediol.<br>
[a]D 20: +16.7° (neat)<br>
The product was measured for optical purity by an HPLC using optically active column, which was 98.4% e.e. Comparative Example  1  (carried out  according to  JP-A-1-250369) (R) - (-)-2-(1-isobutoxyethoxy)-1-propanol<br>
4.9 g (0.12 mole) of sodium borohydride was suspended at room temperature in a solution of 24.9 g (0.10 mole) of isobutyl (R)-(+)-2-(1-isobutoxyethoxy)propionate dissolved in 100 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane. Thereto was drop-wise added slowly 24.0 ml (0.60 mole) of methanol with stirring so that the internal temperature of the reaction system could be kept at 40°C. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the resulting mixture was stirred at room tempera-<br><br>
ture with the disappearance of the raw material being monitored by GCr to give rise to a reaction, 20 hours were necessary. Then, 50 ml of water was added, followed by stirring for 0.5 hour. The organic layer was separated. The water layer was subjected to extraction with 50 ml of toluene. The two organic layers were combined and washed with 30 ml of water and 30 ml of a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution in this order. The washed solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then subjected to vacuum distillation to remove the solvent. The resulting concentrate was subjected to distillation to obtain 16.3 g (yield: 92.6%) of an oily title compound (diastereomixture).<br>
[a]p24.°: -37.9° (c=1.07, CHCI3)<br>
The IR and MS spectrum agreed with those of the compound obtained in Example 4.<br>
Comparative Example 2 (a reaction in a methanol solvent) Methyl (R)- ( + )-2-(1-isobutoxyethoxy)propionate<br>
0.5 g (0.012 mole) of sodium borohydride was suspended in 10 ml of methanol at room temperature. Thereto was added  2.5  g   (0.01  mole)   of  isobutyl   (R)-( + )-2- (1-<br><br>
isobutoxyethoxy)propionate with stirring.  The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hours but no change was seen.  Therefore the mixture was heated to 60 °C and stirred for 4 hours to give rise to a reaction.  The crude reaction mixture was analyzed.  As a result, the raw material remained by 7% and the main product included 92% of a title compound formed by conversion (ester exchange) of the raw material isobutyl ester to the corresponding methyl ester, and no 2- (1-isobutoxyethoxy)-1-propanol was detected.  After the reaction, 20 ml of water was added, followed by stirring for 0.5 hour.  Then, 50 ml of toluene was added and the organic layer was separated.  The water layer was subjected to extraction with 20 ml of toluene.  The two organic layers were combined and washed with 20 ml of water and 20 ml of a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution in this order. The washed solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then subjected to vacuum distillation to remove the solvent.  The resulting concentrate was subjected to distillation to obtain 1.8 g (yield: 90.8%) of an oily methyl ester compound.  The GC-MS spectrum of this compound agreed with<br><br>
that of the compound obtained in Reference Example 5<br><br><br><br><br>
