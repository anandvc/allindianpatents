&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"VEHICLE AIR CLEANER STRUCTURE."<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaiyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
21-6-2006<br><br><br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle air cleaner structure which facilitates attachment of secondary air control valve and preferably reduces attachment cost. [Prior Art]<br>
As a structure where an air passage is provided from the air cleaner side to the engine intake passage side or exhaust.<br>
passage side, a seconciary air control valve is provided in the<br>
middle of the air passage,  and the secondary air control valve<br>
is connected to the air cleaner side, for example, a structure<br>
disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Utility-Model<br>
Application No. Sho 60-87325 "Internal Combustion Engine<br>
Secondary Air Control Apparatus" is known.<br>
The structure win be described with reference to Fig.<br>
2 of the above-mentioned publication as Fig. 8, and Fig. 4 of<br>
the above-mentioned publication, as Fig. 9.  Note, that<br>
reference numerals are reassigned.<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross - sectional view of the conventional<br>
secondary air control valve, in which an air-fuel mixture<br>
control valve 100 as a secondary air control valve is provided<br>
with a flange 102 on the third chamber 101 side to introduce<br>
secondary air, and the flange 102 is attached to a volume case<br>
104 provided on the air cleaner side by fixing members 103,<br>
103 such as bolts.  Note that numeral 105 denotes a secondary<br>
air passage communicated with an engine intake passage; and<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view of another conventional secondary air control valve, in which an air-fuel mixture control valve 110 as the secondary air control valve is provided with  a secondary air introduction port 111 extended from the third chamber 101 side, and one end of introduction pipe 112 such as a rubber hose is connected to the introduction port 111, and the other end of the introduction pipe 112 is connected<br><br><br>
2<br><br>
to a secondary air discharge pipe 113 projected from the volume case 104.  In this example, the volume case 104 and the secondary air discharge pipe 113 are added to Fig. 4 of the above-mentioned publication.<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In Fig. 8, as the air-fuel mixture control valve 100 is attached to the volume case 104 on the air cleaner side by plural fixing members 103, 103 such as bolts, it takes much time to attach the air-fuel mixture control valve 100. Further, as the secondary air passage 105 and the negative pressure passage 106 project sideways, tools cannot be easily used when the fixing members 103 are screwed-in, and attachment cannot be easily made.<br><br>
Further, in Fig. 9, as the introduction port 111 of the air-fuel mixture control valve 110 and the discharge pipe 113 on the volume case 104 side are connected by the introduction pipe 112 such as a rubber hose, and in accordance with circumstance, the introduction pipe 112 must be fixed to the introduction port 111 side and the discharge pipe 113 side by a clip for prevention of dropping, the number of parts to connect the air-fuel mixture control valve 110 to the air cleaner side is large, and the attachment cost is high.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to facilitate attachment of secondary air control valve and further reduce attachment cost in a vehicle air cleaner<br>
3<br><br>
structure.<br><br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To attain the foregoing object, claim 1 is characterized in that in a vehicle where an air cleaner and an engine exhaust passage are connected with each other by a secondary air supply passage and the secondary air supply passage is provided with a secondary air control valve so as to control the amount of air supplied from the air cleaner to the engine exhaust passage, the air cleaner is provided with an insertion portion in which an air inlet port of the secondary air control valve is directly inserted, and a case of secondary air control valve is supported by the insertion portion. <br>
Conventionally, the secondary air control valve is fixed to the air cleaner by bolts or the like.  In comparison with this structure, in the present invention, as the air cleaner is provided with an insertion portion, the secondary air control valve can be easily supported by the insertion portion, accordingly, the secondary air control valve can be easily attached to the air cleaner. Further, the parts to connect the secondary air control valve to the air cleaner can be reduced, and the cost for attaching the secondary air control valve can be reduced.<br><br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the air cleaner is provided with a sub air cleaner chamber to supply air to the side of the secondary air control valve, aside from a main air<br><br><br>
4<br><br>
cleaner chamber to supply air to an engine intake passage.<br>
As the air cleaner is provided with the sub air cleaner chamber, the secondary air control valve side is not influenced by the pulse of pressure on the main air cleaner chamber side. Thus sufficient air can be supplied to the secondary air control valve side, and oxidation of unburned gas in the exhaust passage can be excellently performed.<br><br>
[Working Examples of the Invention] Hereinbelow, working examples of the present invention will be described in accordance with the attached drawings. Note that the figures are to be viewed along directions of numerals.<br>
[Brief Explanation of the Drawings] [Fig. 1] A side view of the vehicle where the air cleaner structure according to the present invention is employed. [Fig. 2] A system diagram of the intake system and the secondary air supply system according to the present invention. [Fig. 3] A plan view of the air cleaner and the secondary air control valve according to the present invention. [Fig. 4] A diagram viewed along 4 arrows in Fig. 3.<br>
