				<td>A PROCESS FOR METALWORKING FLUID FROM HEAVY ALKYLATE<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for metalworking fluids from heavy alkylate More particularly this invention relates to composition of metalworking fluid and process for its preparation based on heavy alkyl benzenes having 22 to 26 carbon atoms to replace mineral oil<br>
Background and Prior Art References.<br>
Traditionally, the mineral oils and petroleum sulfonates have been the basic source of metalworking fluid formulations The petroleum based lubricating oils and sulfonates are hydrocarbons of varying composition consisting of naphthenes, paraffins and aromatics The sulfonates on the other hand formed by sulfonation of aromatic components in these lubricating oil streams act as oil/water emulsifiers Besides these various additives, which are primarily chemicals of defined composition or structure, are added to the soluble oils to improve the physico-chemical properties and performance of metalworking fluids Petroleum based soluble oils, generally suffer from many disadvantages such as higher toxicity to the environment, poor biodegradability and ever-changing characteristics with changes in crude oil composition The other types of lubricants known as synthetic lubricants are designed for use in extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, radiation or chemical environment and have excellent lubricity and thermal stability The synthetic lubricants are relatively costly as compared to petroleum based lubricants Poly-glycols, polybutenes, dibasic acid esters, fluoropolymers, polyol esters, phosphate esters, silicones, poly-alpha olefins etc are commonly used synthetic lubricants for various applications  Some of the synthetics are also toxic to environment and are not readily<br>
biodegradable Similar disadvantages are found with Petroleum sulfonates which are byproducts of sulfonation of lubricating oils also suffer from inconsistent emulsification and compatibility characteristics due to everchanging composition of the lubricating oils Keeping in the view the environmental concerns and improved performance, consistency in structural and performance characteristics, there is a need to develop alternative lubricant and emulsifier component, for metalworking fluids, which are less toxic and low cost which show equivalent or improved performance to mineral oil or synthetic lubricant based metalworking fluids<br>
The use of Heavy alkyl benzene as lubricant is very limited Recently, the Heavy Alkyl Benzene alkaline earth metal sulfonates are in use as detergent-dispersant-anti rust additive in various types of lubricants<br>
Reference may be made to M/S Petresa, Madrid, Spain, (www petresa es) wherein they are marketing heavy alkylate under the brand name of 'PETRENE' to be use as thermal fluid, transformer oil, refrigerating oil, sulfonation feedstock and lubricating greases but not for metalworking fluids<br>
Reference may be made to M/s Chevron, USA Inc , (San Ramon, CA) has US patent 6,187,981 "Process for producing arylalkanes and arylalkanes sulfonates, compositions produced therefrom, and uses thereof Wherein this invention is a process for producing aryl-alkanes This invention also provides process that to produce modified alkylbenzene sulfonates, which can be used as detergents<br>
Chevron, USA Inc, (San Ramon, CA) has US patent 6,392,109 "Synthesis of alkylbenzenes and synlubes from Fischer-Tropsch products" which is for an integrated process for producing alkylbenzenes, sulfonated alkylbenzenes and/or alkylcyclohexanes from syngas and used as detergents and/or dispersants<br>
In view of the growing concern about the environment, there is a need for less-toxic lubricant component for metalworking soluble oil based on Heavy alkyl benzene, which is a new application of the heavy alkylate It will not only reduce the toxicity of soluble oil but also will be more cost effective than mineral oil because of improved and consistent performance because both the mineral oil component and the sulfonates made from these alkylates can be tailoied to obtain a high performance product of consistent quality It is an additional benefit to the alkylate industry Objects of the Invention.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for metalworking fluids from heavy alkylate<br>
Another object of the present invention is to pro\ ide heavy alkylate based less toxic lubricant component metalwoi king fluids<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new application to the byproduct heavy alkylate<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide new composition of metalworking fluid for the benefit of metalworking and alkylate manufactunng industries<br>
Summary of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for metalworking fluids from heavy alkylate More particularly this invention relates to composition of metalworking fluid and process for its preparation based on heavy alkyl benzenes having 22 to 26 carbon atoms to replace mineral oil<br>
The speed of machining could be greatly increased if the cutting surface is kept cool and lubricated Water can be regarded as the first cutting fluid because of its high specific and<br>
latent heats to give it unique potential cooling power and also it is available everywhere at low cost However, due to poor wetting efficiency, water alone can't cool the metal surface with its full ability Another serious disadvantage is the formation of rust on iron and steel surfaces Modern development has led to the introduction of advanced water-oil emulsion incorporating special chemicals, which considerably improve its wettability, lubrication, high cooling power, rust inhibiting and detergency properties These concentrates and their emulsions in water are known as 'Soluble Oil' They are ideal for general machining process where Cooling, Lubrication, Cleaning and extreme pressure characteristics are essential requirements Detailed description.<br>
