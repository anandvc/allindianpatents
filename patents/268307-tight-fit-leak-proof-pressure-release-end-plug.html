				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of Invention: The present invention relates to tight fit, leak proof pressure release end plug for closing the ends of telecom ducts.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Problem with the deployment of telecom cables is to immune the inside of the duct from the environmental effects like water seepage, deposition of dust and mud prior to blowing of the cables through the duct. Duct is required to be air tight, as they are subjected to a variety of environmental conditions. Such ducts are frequently deployed underground, and it is important to ensure that water, dust and other foreign particles do not come in contact with the optical fiber cable; also there is a need to provide an escape route for the hot air or gases developed in the enclosures of such ducts.<br>
For the above purpose the empty optic fiber cable ducts are generally terminated at both ends using detachable end caps /end plugs which hold tightly onto the duct. The conventional end caps suffer from the drawback of not having enough strength and hence fall off during the duct transportation, handling and installation. Also these caps have small hole to assist inside hot air in escaping and hence chances of entry of water and other foreign particles into the duct are enhanced. The conventional end plugs, which generally put after cable installation before cable blowing, suffer from the drawback of not having provision for escaping inside hot air developed in the duct. Also these end plugs are removable and many times stolen in the field and hence more chances of entry of water and other foreign particles into the duct.<br>
Object and summary of the invention:<br>
Object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks by providing "Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug" for telecom ducts.<br>
To achieve the said objective the present invention provides Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug for telecom ducts comprising:<br>
a body having at least one O-ring and a corresponding groove for air tight holding on to the duct,<br>
an enclosure in the said plug, facing the duct,<br>
a non returnable flexible valve fitted in the said enclosure such that the split portion of the valve is on the outer side of the said plug, the arrangement being such that when the pressure inside the said duct increases beyond<br>
f0.25 Kg /cm  the said valve opens and releases the hot air present inside the duct.<br>
The valve is made up of thermoplastic elastomers and consists of a pressure sensing cavity controlled slit made on one side and a ring shaped base plate on the other side.<br>
The enclosure is tapered and has a ring cut in its inner surface to facilitate easy opening and closing of the valve.<br>
The enclosure is preferably co-axial with the body of said plug. Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
The invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the exploded front view of the "Pressure release End Plug" for telecom<br>
ducts according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the front view of non-returnable flexible valve of the "Pressure release<br>
End Plug" for telecom ducts.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the perspective view of the "Pressure release End Plug" fitted on to the<br>
telecom duct.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the exploded perspective view of the "Pressure release End Plug" fitted<br>
on to the telecom duct.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
Referring to the drawings a Pressure release End Plug made up of thermoplastic polymer, includes a body (3) having at least two grooves (8) on the outer surface of it, where O-rings (2) can be fitted. O-rings (2) are made up of highly flexible and good quality rubber material for air tight holding on to the duct (1). The said combination of body, groove and O-rings not only provides airtight arrangement but also restricts any foreign matter from entering into the duct and also do not come out during duct handling and installation. A non-returnable flexible valve (4) is fitted to enclosure (9). The said enclosure (9) is preferably in the middle of the body (3) facing the duct. The enclosure (9) is tapered and has a ring cut in its inner surface to facilitate easy opening and closing of the said non-returnable flexible valve (4). The said non-returnable valve (4) has a pressure-sensing cavity (6) controlled slit (5) on one side and a ring shaped base plate (7) on the other side. The non-returnable valve (4) is made up of thermoplastic elastomer material to provide desired flexibility. The ring shaped base plate (7) faces towards the duct and the said slit (5) faces to the outside, so that when pressure inside the duct (1) increases, the slit (5) of the said valve opens up and releases the air to the atmosphere. The non returnable flexible valve (4) fitted in the said enclosure; the arrangement between the duct and the non returnable valve being such that when the pressure inside the duct increases beyond 0.25 Kg/cm2, said valve opens and releases the hot air present inside the duct (1) and does not allow foreign bodies like water, dust, mud etc to enter inside the duct.<br>
Pressure Release End Plug specification and operating parameters are given below by way of an example<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
We  claim:<br>
1.	A Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug for closing the ends of the<br>
telecom duct comprising:<br>
a body having at least one O-ring and a corresponding groove for air tight<br>
holding on to the duct<br>
an enclosure in the said plug, facing the duct,<br>
a non returnable flexible valve fitted in said enclosure,<br>
the arrangement between the duct and the non returnable valve being such that when the pressure inside the duct increases beyond 0.25 Kg/cm 2 , said valve opens and releases the hot air present inside the duct.<br>
2.	A Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
said valve is made up of thermoplastic elastomer, and consists of a pressure-sensing<br>
cavity controlled slit made on one side and a ring shaped base plate on the other side.<br>
3.	A Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
enclosure is tapered and has a ring cut in its inner surface to facilitate easy opening<br>
and closing of the valve.<br>
4.	A Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
enclosure is preferably co-axial with the body of said plug.<br>
5.	A Tight fit, Leak proof Pressure release End Plug substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
