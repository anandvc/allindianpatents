[0001]      The subject matter of this application was in part funded by the<br>
National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant no. CHE 0097096; by the Defense<br>
. Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grant no. FA8650-04-C-7101;<br>
and by the Department of Energy (DOE) Grant no. DEFG02-91ER45439. The<br>
government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]      Soft lithography is a versatile patterning technique for use in<br>
microfabrication to produce microstructures. This technique uses a patterned<br>
elastomer to transfer a pattern from a master to a substrate. The patterned<br>
elastomer may be used, for example, as a stamp to transfer a substance, as a mold<br>
to be filled by a substance, or as a mask to provide for selective deposition onto a<br>
substrate and/or selective removal of material from the substrate. See, for<br>
example, Xia, Y. and Whitesides, GM. Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. (1998) 28:153-184.<br>
[0003]      In contrast, conventional photolithography utilizes rigid photomasks to<br>
pattern photoresist layers, and the patterned photoresist then protects the material<br>
beneath the pattern during subsequent etching and deposition steps. Soft<br>
lithography provides a number of advantages over conventional photolithography.<br>
Soft lithography can yield three-dimensional structures and non-planar structures<br>
in a single deposition step, rather than requiring the stepwise assembly of<br>
individual layers. Due to the mechanical flexiblility of the elastomer, non-planar<br>
substrates can be patterned. The various soft lithographic techniques can also be<br>
used with a more diverse range of materials than are available with<br>
photolithography, and the materials and techniques used in soft lithography are<br>
typically much lower in cost. Because of these advantages, soft lithography has<br>
proven useful for applications including integrated optics, microelectromechanical<br><br>
systems (MEMS), microfluidics, and patterning of biological material such as<br>
proteins, nucleic acids and cells.<br>
[0004]      In one example, a patterned elastomeric stamp can be contacted with a<br>
substrate to form channels which can exhibit a pattern in two or three dimensions.<br>
The channels can then be filled with a liquid precursor for a solid substance, such<br>
as a polymer or a ceramic. The channels can also be used to mix different fluid<br>
substances, thus functioning as a microreactor or a microanalytical tool. The<br>
formation of solid patterned structures with this technique is referred to as<br>
Micromolding In Capillaries, or "MIMIC." Drawbacks to this technique include<br>
the need for the pattern to be continuous to allow the entire pattern to be filled.<br>
Also, the channels must be large enough to accommodate the viscosity of the<br>
liquid used to fill the pattern, which can limit the resolution that can be obtained.<br>
[0005]      In another example, a patterned elastomeric stamp can be coated with a<br>
substance and then contacted with a substrate. Removal of the stamp results in a<br>
deposition of the substance onto the substrate in the pattern of the stamp. The<br>
substance which is transferred thus functions as an ink which is printed onto the<br>
substrate. This technique, referred to as microcontact printing or "ÂµCP," can be<br>
used to form discontinuous patterns, and can form patterns with higher resolution<br>
than MIMIC. Applications of microcontact printing typically involve additive<br>
lithography, which is the selective deposition of another substance on either the<br>
patterned ink or on the exposed substrate. Drawbacks to this technique include the<br>
limited range of materials which can be used as the substrate and as the ink.<br>
[0006]      In yet another example, a patterned elastomeric membrane can be<br>
applied to a substrate. This membrane can then function as a mask for selective<br>
removal of the exposed substrate (subtractive lithography), or for additive<br>
lithography. Depending on the materials used for the membrane and the substrate,<br>
reversible bonding between the two can be used to stabilize the membrane during<br>
the desired microfabrication and to remove the membrane once it has served its<br>
intended purpose. Drawbacks to this technique include the extreme difficulty in<br>
applying, removing, and manipulating the thin elastomeric membrane. Also, the<br><br>
membrane must be continuous and cannot be used for imaging discrete forms<br>
and patterns.<br>
[0007] It is thus desirable to provide an improved soft lithographic technique that<br>
can be used to form patterns that are continuous or discrete, two dimensional or<br>
three dimensional, on planar and non-planar substrates, and that may be in the<br>
form of channels or masks for additive and subtractive lithography. It is also<br>
desirable that these patterns can be formed on and with a wide range of<br>
substances, without the need for delicate handling of the materials involved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028]      In a first aspect of the invention, a method of making a microstructure<br>
includes selectively activating a portion of a surface of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer, contacting the activated portion with a substance, and bonding the<br>
activated portion and the substance. The activated portion of the surface and the<br>
substance in contact with the activated portion are irreversibly attached.<br><br>
[0029]      These aspects may include a method wherein the selectively activating<br>
includes partially covering the surface to provide a protected portion of the surface<br>
and an unprotected portion of the surface, and applying an activating treatment to<br>
the unprotected portion. These aspects may further include a method wherein the<br>
applying an activating treatment includes irradiating the unprotected portion with<br>
UV radiation. These aspects may further include a method wherein the partially<br>
covering the surface includes positioning a mask on the surface of the silicon-<br>
containing elastomer. The mask has a pattern of UV-opaque portions and UV-<br>
transparent portions and includes a spacer material under the UV-opaque portions.<br>
The unprotected portion of the surface is below and spaced apart from the UV-<br>
transparent portions.<br>
[0030]      In a second aspect of the invention, a method of making a<br>
microstructure includes positioning a mask as described above on an unpatterned<br>
surface of a silicon-containing elastomer, such that the unpatterned surface has an<br>
exposed portion below and spaced apart from the UV-transparent portions,<br>
irradiating the exposed portion of the unpatterned surface with UV radiation,<br>
removing the mask from the surface, contacting the surface with a substrate, and<br>
separating the silicon-containing elastomer and the substrate. The substrate and<br>
the exposed portion of the surface remain in contact.<br>
[0031]      In a third aspect of the invention, a method of making a microstructure<br>

UV-transparent portions, irradiating the exposed portion of raised areas with UV<br>
radiation, removing the mask from the surface, contacting the raised areas with a<br>
substrate, and separating the silicon-containing elastomer and the substrate. The<br>
substrate and the exposed portion of the raised areas remain in contact.<br>
[0032]      These aspects may also include a method where, after the separating, an<br>
etching agent is applied to the substrate to remove a portion of the substrate which<br>
is not in contact with the exposed portion of the surface. The silicon-containing<br><br>
elastomer may then be removed from the substrate. These embodiments may also<br>
include a method where, after the separating, a material is deposited on the<br>
substrate. The silicon-containing elastomer may then be removed from the<br>
substrate to provide a pattern of the deposited material.<br>
[0033]      In a fourth aspect of the invention, a method of making a microstructure<br>
includes positioning a mask as described above on a surface of a silicon-<br>
containing elastomer, such that the surface has an exposed portion below and<br>
spaced apart from the UV-transparent portions, irradiating the exposed portion<br>
with UV radiation; removing the mask from the surface, contacting the surface<br>
with a discrete material, and removing unbound discrete material from the surface.<br>
The exposed portion and the discrete material in contact with the exposed portion<br>
remain attached.<br>
[0034]      In a fifth aspect of the invention, a method of making a microstructure<br>
includes positioning a mask as described above on a surface of a silicon-<br>
containing elastomer, such that the surface has an exposed portion below and<br>
spaced apart from the UV-transparent portions, irradiating the exposed portion<br>
with UV radiation, removing the mask from the surface, contacting the surface<br>
with a chemical compound, and rinsing the silicon-containing elastomer. The<br>
silicon-containing elastomer and the chemical compound in contact with the<br>
activated portion of the surface remain attached.<br>
[0035]      In a sixth aspect of the invention, a method of selectively activating a<br>
surface includes positioning a mask as described above on a surface of a silicon-<br>
containing elastomer, such that the surface has an exposed portion below and<br>
spaced apart from the UV-transparent portions, and irradiating the exposed portion<br>
of the surface with UV radiation.<br>
[0036]      The term "microstructure," as used herein, is defined as a structure or<br>
pattern containing features which are 1,000 micrometers (urn) or smaller. The<br>
formation of microstructures is referred to herein as "microfabrication" and<br>
includes, but is not limited to, techniques such as microlithography, soft<br>
lithography, MIMIC, and self-assembly.<br><br>
[0037]      The term "activate," as used herein with respect to silicon-containing<br>
elastomers, is defined as converting an inert surface into a reactive surface. For<br>
example, a surface in its normal, unactivated state may not adhere to a substrate;<br>
however, activation of this surface provides for strong adhesion between the<br>
surface and the same substrate.<br>
[0038]      The term "selectively activate," as used herein, is defined as activating<br>
a specific portion of a surface, while maintaining the rest of the surface in an<br>
unactivated state.<br>
[0039]      The term "irreversibly attached," as used herein, means that the<br>
bonding between two substances is sufficiently strong that the substances cannot<br>
be mechanically separated without damaging or destroying one or both of the<br>
substances. Substances which are irreversibly attached may be separated by<br>
exposure to an appropriate chemical environment, such as chemical reagents or<br>
irradiation.<br>
[0040]      The term "on" is defined as "above" and is relative to the orientation<br>
being described. For example, if a first element is positioned over at least a<br>
portion of a second element, the first element is said to be "positioned on" the<br>
second. In another example, if a first element is present above at least a portion of<br>
a second element, the first element is said to be "on" the second. The use of the<br>
term "on" does not exclude the presence of substances between the upper and<br>
lower elements being described. For example, a first element may have a coating<br>
over its top surface, yet a second element over at least a portion of the first<br>
element and its top coating can be described as "on" the first element. Thus, the<br>
use of the term "on" may or may not mean that the two elements being related are<br>
in physical contact with each other.<br>
[0041]      Similarly, the term "under" is defined as "below" relative to the<br>
orientation being described. The use of the term "under" does not preclude the<br>
presence of substances between the elements being described, and may or may not<br>
mean that the elements are in physical contact with each other.<br><br>
[0042]      The term "elastomer," as used herein, is defined as a polymer which<br>
can return to its initial dimensions when deformed by an external force. A<br>
polymer is considered an elastomer when it meets the following standard. A<br>
sample of the polymer in its solid state and having an initial linear dimension DÂ° is<br>
subjected to a force such that the dimension is changed by 10%. Once the force is<br>
no longer applied, the dimension assumes a value of De, where De = DÂ° Â± 0.0lD0.<br>
[0043]      The term "silicon-containing elastomer," as used herein, is an elastomer<br>
which contains silicon (Si) atoms. Examples of silicon-containing elastomers<br>
include, but are not limited to, polysiloxanes, such as poly(dimethyl siloxane),<br>
poIy(methyl siloxane), partially alkylated poly(methyl siloxane), poly(aIkyl<br>
methyl siloxane) and poly(phenyl methyl siloxane); block copolymers containing<br>
segments of a polysiloxane and another polymer; silicon-modified elastomers,<br>
such as silicon-modified natural rubber, silicon-modified polyolefins (including<br>
silicon-modified polyisoprene, silicon-modified polybutadiene, and silicon-<br>
modified polyisobutylene), silicon-modified polyimides, silicon-modified<br>
crosslinked phenol-formaldehyde resins (Si-modified NOVOLAC), and silicon-<br>
modified polyurethane elastomers. Silicon modification of elastomers may be<br>
carried out by reactions with silanes and siloxanes, including hydrosilation and<br>
condensation. Preferably the silicon-containing elastomer is a polysiloxane. More<br>
preferably, the silicon-containing elastomer is poly(dimethyl siloxane), referred to<br>
as "PDMS."<br>
[0044]      Further examples of silicon-containing elastomers include block<br>
copolymers of polysiloxanes with other polymers. For example, block copolymers<br>
containing polysiloxanes may be formed with polyolefins such as polyethylene<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,618,903, incorporated herein by reference), poly(isobutylene)<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,859, incorporated herein by reference), polypropylene (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,744,541, incorporated herein by reference), polystyrene and various<br>
polydienes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,649, incorporated herein by reference), and<br>
polyisoprene and polybutadiene (U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,288, incorporated herein by<br>
reference). In another example, block copolymers containing polysiloxanes may<br><br>
be formed with acrylates (U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,902, incorporated herein by<br>
reference), with a wide variety of polymers formed by polymerization of<br>
unsaturated monomers (U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,411, incorporated herein by<br>
reference), and with a variety of types of siloxanes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,668,<br>
incorporated herein by reference). In another example, block copolymers<br>
containing polysiloxanes may be formed with condensation polymers such as<br>
polycarbonates (U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,011, incorporated herein by reference) and<br>
poly(arylene ethers) (U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,131, incorporated herein by reference)<br>
and may also be formed with polyethers such as polyethylene oxide and<br>
polypropylene oxide (U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,711, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Further examples of silicon-containing elastomers include copolymers containing<br>
polysiloxane repeat units in combination with polyester and/or polycarbonate<br>
repeat units (U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,193, incorporated herein by reference), and also<br>
include blends of polysiloxanes with polyamides (U.S. Pat. No. 6,344,521,<br>
incorporated herein by reference) and blends of polysiloxanes with polyolefins,<br>
polyurethanes, or styrenic polymers (U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,691, incorporated herein<br>
by reference). Further examples of silicon-containing elastomers include<br>
polymers modified to contain silicon by treatment with silane compounds (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,136,926, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
[0045]      Microstructures containing a silicon-containing elastomer can be<br>
prepared by irreversibly bonding an activated silicon-containing elastomer and<br>
another material. For example, activation of a portion of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer, followed by contacting and bonding the surface of the activated portion<br>
with a monolithic substrate can form an irreversible attachment between the<br>
activated portion of the elastomer and the substrate. When the elastomer is pulled<br>
away or otherwise separated from the substrate, the elastomer can undergo<br>
cohesive failure, separating the bulk portion from the activated portion.<br>
Preferably, the cohesive failure is such that a film of elastomer material remains<br>
bonded to the substrate only in regions where the elastomer surface has been<br>
activated and then placed in contact with the substrate. In another example,<br><br>
contacting and bonding of a silicon-containing elastomer having an activated<br>
portion with a chemical compound or a discrete material can provide for a pattern<br>
of the compound or material on the elastomer surface.<br>
[0046]      The selective activation of a portion of a silicon-containing elastomer<br>
may be accomplished by protecting a portion of a silicon-containing elastomer,<br>
and then applying an activating treatment to the unprotected portion. For example,<br>
a hard mask may be formed on a surface of a silicon-containing elastomer, and the<br>
exposed portions of the elastomer surface can be subjected to an activating<br>
treatment. The hard mask must then be removed before the elastomer can be<br>
bonded to another material. In another example, a free-standing mask can be<br>
positioned on the surface of the silicon-containing elastomer, such that the mask<br>
and elastomer can be separated readily after the activating treatment.<br>
[0047]      The activating treatment can be any of a variety of treatments known in<br>
the art, provided the desired portions of the elastomer can be protected from the<br>
treatment. In one method, for example, the elastomer can be exposed to an<br>
oxygenated plasma to activate the exposed elastomer surface. This activation can<br>
be carried out by converting a stream of oxygen into a plasma at a temperature as<br>
low as 40Â°C. In another method, the silicon-containing elastomer is activated by<br>
oxidation through a UV/Ozone treatment. This treatment process, referred to as<br>
"UVO," is described, for example in co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>
10/230,882 (U.S. Patent No. 6,805,809), which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The UVO process involves oxidation of the surface of a silicon-<br>
containing elastomer by exposing the surface to ultraviolet radiation sufficient to<br>
generate ozone and/or other oxidizing species, such as singlet oxygen, from an<br>
ambient atmosphere. Activation by UVO can also include exposing the surface to<br>
an atmosphere enriched in either molecular oxygen (O2) or ozone (O3). One<br>
advantage of the activation by UVO is that the silicon-containing elastomer can<br>
become sufficiently activated under mild conditions.<br>
[0048]      The amount of UVO treatment may be varied depending on the type of<br>
silicon-containing elastomer and the type of material to which the elastomer is to<br><br>
be bonded. For example, for polysiloxanes containing alkyl or aryl organic side<br>
groups which are less volatile than the methyl groups of PDMS, the UVO may<br>
need to be applied for longer periods of time. Also, for silicon-modified<br>
elastomers and polysiloxane-containing block copolymers, an increased duration<br>
of UVO may be needed, since the silicon atoms are less concentrated than in<br>
PDMS. The UV source for the UVO treatment may be any of a variety of UV<br>
sources. Examples of UV sources include mercury discharge lamps, and<br>
deuterium discharge lamps. Preferably the UV source is a deuterium discharge<br>
lamp.<br>
[0049]      A silicon-containing elastomer can be selectively activated using UVO<br>
by applying the UVO treatment to an elastomer that has been covered with a<br>
mask. The mask for UVO treatment preferably provides both for transmission of<br>
UV radiation to the exposed regions of the elastomer and for contact of the<br>
exposed regions with an atmosphere containing oxygen. The oxygen present in<br>
this atmosphere, in combination with UV radiation, can serve to activate the<br>
exposed portion of the elastomer.<br>
[0050]      The general design of a mask 100 for selective UVO activation is<br>
shown in Figures 1-4, in which a UV-transparent lens 110 is partially covered with<br>
a UV-opaque layer 120. The patterned UV-opaque layer is covered with a spacer<br>
material 130. The gap 140 defined by the UV-transparent material 110, the<br>
exposed portion 152 of the silicon-containing elastomer 150, and the spacers 130<br>
allows the elastomer to be in contact with an atmosphere during the UVO<br>
treatment. In a specific example of a UVO mask, the UV-transparent lens is a<br>
quartz lens, and the UV-opaque film is a patterned gold film. It may be desirable<br>
to provide a titanium layer between the quartz and the gold film, in which case the<br>
titanium preferably has the same pattern as the gold film.<br>
[0051]      Preferably, the spacer material is the photoresist material that was used<br>
to pattern the UV-opaque film. Although a photoresist material is typically<br>
removed after the underlying layer or layers have been patterned, the use of the<br>
photoresist as the spacer material can provide a number of advantages.<br><br>
Photoresists are typically deposited in a layer of uniform, controllable thickness,<br>
thus the resulting spacer material will likewise have a uniform thickness that can<br>
be varied as needed. In addition, since the photoresist is originally used to pattern<br>
the UV-opaque layer, the spacer material is already in alignment with the UV-<br>
opaque portions of the mask, providing for precise definition of the UV-<br>
transparent openings in the mask. Photoresist material can be selected to constrain<br>
the UV radiation and possibly to inhibit the migration of photogenerated reactive<br>
species. A specific example of a photoresist that can also be used as the spacer<br>
material is the SU-8 series of photoresists, which can allow for patterning of<br>
features from 1 Âµm or less to 200 Âµm or greater.<br>
[0052]      The thickness of the spacer material can be varied. In the example of<br>
photoresist material as the spacer, the thickness can be controlled at the outset of<br>
the patterning process by controlling the initial thickness of the photoresist that is<br>
deposited on the UV-opaque layer. Preferably, the spacer material is sufficiently<br>
thick to allow for adequate amounts of oxygen in the gap region between the<br>
elastomer and the UV-transparent portion of the mask. Preferably the thickness of<br>
the spacer is at least 100 nanometers, more preferably at least 0.5 microns, and<br>
even more preferably at least 3 microns.<br>
[0053]      Selective activation of a silicon-containing elastomer can be used to<br>
deposit a pattern of the elastomer on a substrate. The activated surface of a<br>
silicon-containing elastomer can be irreversibly attached to the surface of a<br>
substrate material by contacting the activated surface and the substrate and<br>
bonding together the surface and the substrate. Suitable substrates include, but are<br>
not limited to, silicon; ceramic materials such as silicon oxide, quartz and glass;<br>
polymers such as polystyrene and silicon-containing elastomers, including PDMS;<br>
and metals such as titanium, chromium, tungsten, and gold. Preferably, the<br>
surface of the silicon-containing elastomer is treated with UVO at ambient<br>
temperature for an appropriate length of time and is then immediately contacted<br>
with a substrate that has been recently cleaned.<br><br>
[0054]      The elastomer and substrate are kept in contact to allow the formation<br>
of an irreversible bond. The contacted elastomer and substrate may be subjected<br>
to heating and/or supplemental ultraviolet radiation to assist the formation of the<br>
bond. For example, after contacting UVO treated PDMS with a silicon substrate,<br>
the irreversible bond can be obtained by maintaining the contact for about 16<br>
hours at ambient temperature, by maintaining the materials at 70Â°C for at least 20<br>
minutes, or by applying UV radiation to the PDMS for at least 30 minutes.<br>
Exposure of unoxidized silicon-containing elastomers to only one of heat, ozone<br>
or UV radiation will not typically provide irreversible adhesion to substrates.<br>
[0055]      The initial contact between the UVO-activated surface of the silicon-<br>
containing elastomer and the substrate surface typically will not result in an<br>
irreversible bond. This phenomenon allows for the precise positioning of the<br>
elastomer and the substrate. Thus, any patterns in the elastomer and/or the<br>
substrate can be aligned or registered prior to the formation of an irreversible<br>
bond. The use of an optically transparent silicon-containing elastomer (such as<br>
PDMS) may also be desirable, in that alignment or registration of films and<br>
patterns can be done using optical observation.<br>
[0056]      It may be desirable to clean the surface of the substrate prior to<br>
contacting the substrate with the UVO-activated silicon-containing elastomer.<br>
Substrates may be cleaned by conventional methods. For example, substrates of<br>
silicon or silicon oxide can be rinsed with solvents such as hexanes and ethanol<br>
and dried under an inert gas such as nitrogen. In another example, glass and<br>
quartz can be rinsed with reagents such as piranha (sulfuric acid and hydrogen<br>
peroxide). The substrate may also be cleaned and/or activated by exposure to<br>
UVO, to a plasma such as an argon plasma or other plasma, or to other chemical<br>
treatments. It may also be desirable to treat the surface of the substrate with UVO<br>
immediately prior to contacting it with the activated elastomer. The treatment of<br>
the substrate may conveniently be carried out by subjecting the elastomer surface<br>
and the substrate surface to the same UVO exposure. For metal substrates such as<br>
gold, it may be useful to apply an adhesion promoter such as a thiol compound to<br><br>
the metal surface and/or the elastomer surface. Examples of thiol compounds<br>
include thiol-silane compounds such as (thiolpropyl)-trimethoxysilane.<br>
[0057]      Referring to Figure 1, the selective activation of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer can be used to deposit a portion of a pre-formed pattern of an elastomer<br>
onto a substrate. This process, referred to as "Photodefined Cohesive Mechanical<br>
Failure" (P-CMF), uses a patterned stamp 160 to provide the basic pattern of the<br>
silicon-containing elastomer. This basic pattern is then further defined by<br>
selective activation of the raised portions of the pattern in the stamp. The<br>
patterned stamp 160 is placed into contact with the patterned side of a UVO<br>
photomask 100, and is then irradiated through the mask by a UV source. After<br>
UV irradiation, the stamp is peeled away from the UVO photomask, and the<br>
patterned face of the stamp is placed promptly into contact with a substrate<br>
material 180. Preferably the time between the end of the irradiation and the<br>
contact with the substrate is less than one minute. While maintaining contact, the<br>
stamp and substrate are subjected to the conditions necessary to form an<br>
irreversible bond between the elastomer and the substrate. Starting from any<br>
corner, tweezers are used to peel the stamp away to leave a patterned film 190 on<br>
the substrate.<br>
[0058]      Referring to Figure 2, the selective activation of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer can be used to deposit a portion of an unpatterned elastomer onto a<br>
substrate. This process, referred to as "direct lithography," uses a planar blank of<br>
elastomer 250, such that all patterning is a result of the selective activation<br>
process. The elastomer blank is placed into contact with the patterned side of a<br>
UVO photomask 100, and is then irradiated through the mask by a UV source.<br>
After UV irradiation, the elastomer is peeled away from the UVO photomask, and<br>
the irradiated surface of the blank is placed promptly into contact with a substrate<br>
material 280. Preferably the time between the end of the irradiation and the<br>
contact with the substrate is less than one minute. While maintaining contact, the<br>
elastomer and substrate are subjected to the conditions necessary to form an<br>
irreversible bond between the elastomer and the substrate. Starting from any<br><br>
corner, tweezers are used to peel the elastomer away to leave a patterned film 290<br>
on the substrate.<br>
[0059]      The elastomer pattern transfers of these P-CMF and direct lithography<br>
methods involve contributions of chemically activated adhesive bonding and<br>
cohesive material failure processes. The yield strength of the patterned elastomer<br>
as it is peeled from the substrate can be affected both by the total elastomer<br>
contact area and by the feature sizes. Thus, the patterning method based on<br>
cohesive failure is especially useful for transferring patterns with small feature<br>
sizes (100 Âµm or smaller) over relatively large areas. One advantage of this<br>
method is that it can transfer patterns in a manner that allows registration of<br>
multiple patterns and that enables micron scale patterning over large areas. The<br>
locus of the cohesive failure of the elastomer progressively approaches that of the<br>
surface of the features as their sizes approach the 1 micron level. Pattern transfers<br>
in a thickness range of 10-100 run can be attained for a 1.0 Âµm minimum feature<br>
size, based on a master with a 1 Âµm feature height as a specific example. The<br>
removal of the bulk elastomer for these small features sizes also tends to require a<br>
lower amount of force.<br>
[0060]      The direct lithography process in particular can provide for the<br>
formation of patterns at the sub-micron scale. Although the gap formed between<br>
the elastomer and the mask at these dimensions is extremely small (on the order of<br>
nanoliters), there is sufficient oxygen present to provide for effective UVO<br>
activation. An example of a sub-micron patterned structure is shown in the<br>
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images of Figure 8 A and 8B. The line pattern<br>
shown contains lines having widths and separations of approximately 300 nm.<br>
[0061]       The P-CMF process in particular can provide for the formation of<br>
arrays of patterns. If the minimum dimensions of the mask pattern are larger than<br>
the minimum dimensions of the pattern in the initial elastomer stamp, then a<br>
subset of the pattern in the stamp can be transferred to the substrate. An example<br>
of an array of a cylindrical pattern is shown in the optical micrograph of Figure<br>
5 A. An example of an array of a pattern of lines is shown in the optical<br><br>
micrographs of Figures 6A and 6C. This pattern of lines is illustrated as<br>
transferred to a pattern of gold lines in Figure 6D.<br>
[0062]      The decal transfer methods allow the deposition of precisely designed<br>
polymer thin-films with a remarkable range of feature sizes. Minimum feature<br>
sizes in these patterns may be less than 100 micrometers. Preferably, minimum<br>
feature sizes are from 1 nanometer to 100 micrometers, and more preferably from<br>
10 nanometers to 10 micrometers. In one example, the minimum feature size is<br>
less than 1 micrometer.<br>
[0063]      Selective activation of a silicon-containing elastomer can be used to<br>
form a pattern of another material. For example, an etching agent can be applied<br>
to the substrate so as to remove the portion of the substrate that is not attached to<br>
the patterned elastomer. Subsequent removal of the elastomer can provide a<br>
pattern in the substrate. In another example, a separate material can be deposited<br>
onto the substrate and the patterned elastomer. Subsequent removal of the<br>
elastomer can provide a pattern of the deposited material. In addition to these<br>
lithographic techniques, patterning of other materials can be accomplished by<br>
attaching the activated surface of a silicon-containing elastomer to individual<br>
chemical compounds, to discrete materials, or to monolithic materials having a<br>
cohesive force weaker than that of the elastomer.<br>
[0064]      Referring to Figure 3, the selective activation of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer can be used to remove a portion of discrete material from another<br>
substrate. Although a planar blank 350 of elastomer is pictured, a patterned stamp<br>
could also be used. The elastomer is placed into contact with the patterned side of<br>
a UVO photomask 100, and is then irradiated through the mask by a UV source.<br>
After UV irradiation, the elastomer is peeled away from the UVO photomask, and<br>
the irradiated surface of the blank is placed promptly into contact with the layer of<br>
discrete material 370 on the substrate 380. While maintaining contact, the<br>
elastomer, discrete material and substrate are subjected to the conditions necessary<br>
to form an irreversible bond between the elastomer and the discrete material. The<br>
elastomer can then be lifted away from the substrate to provide a substrate having<br><br>
a pattern 390 of discrete material on its surface. This process also provides a<br>
pattern 360 of the discrete material on the silicon-containing elastomer.<br>
[0065]      The discrete material can be in a variety of forms. For example, the<br>
discrete material may contain powders, particles, platelets, nanotubes, fibers or<br>
wires of materials such as silicon; ceramic materials such as silicon oxide, quartz<br>
and glass; polymers such as polystyrene and silicon-containing elastomers,<br>
including PDMS; and metals such as titanium, chromium, tungsten, and gold.<br>
[0066]      Referring to Figure 4, the selective activation of a silicon-containing<br>
elastomer can be used to form a pattern of a compound on the surface of the<br>
silicon-containing elastomer. Again, either a planar blank 450 of elastomer or a<br>
patterned stamp could be used. The elastomer is placed into contact with the<br>
patterned side of a UVO photomask 100, and is then irradiated through the mask<br>
by a UV source. After UV irradiation, the elastomer is peeled away from the<br>
UVO photomask, and the irradiated surface of the blank is promptly contacted<br>
with the compound, either neat or in a liquid carrier. In some cases, the compound<br>
will rapidly adsorb to the activated portions of the elastomer. In other cases, the<br>
elastomer and compound must undergo a post-treatment to maintain the compound<br>
in the pattern 490. Examples of compounds that can be adsorbed onto an activated<br>
surface of a silicon-containing elastomer include alcohols, carbonyl-containing<br>
compounds, and compounds having one or more silicon-halogen bonds.<br><br>
[0067]      EXAMPLES<br>
[0068]      Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) precursor was obtained from DOW<br>
CORNING (Midland, MI) as SYLGARD 184. Boron doped silicon wafers<br>
() were obtained from SILICON SENSE, INC. (Nashua, NH). Quartz slides<br>
were obtained from CHEMGLASS, INC. (Vineland, NJ). (Tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-<br>
tetrahydrooctyl) trichlorosilane (TFOTS) was obtained from GELEST<br>
(Morrisville, PA). Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 1 molar in<br>
tetrahydrofuran), (mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS), and 2,2,2-<br>
trifluoroethanol were obtained from ALDRICH (Milwaukee, WI). Buffered<br>
hydrofluoric acid (6:1, NH4F/HF) was obtained from ASHLAND (Dublin, OH).<br>
Gold etchant was obtained as TFA from TRANSENE (Danvers, MA). Sulfuric<br>
acid, hydrofluoric acid (49%), and hydrogen peroxide (30%) were obtained from<br>
FISHER (Springfield, NJ). Solvents were obtained from Fisher and from Aldrich.<br>
[0069]      Silicon oxides were grown on silicon wafers under an ambient<br>
atmosphere by heating them to around 800Â°C for several hours to give a ~2500A<br>
thick oxide layer. Masters were produced as described in Deng et al., Anal. Chem.<br>
73:3176-3180 (2000) and in Deng et al., Langmuir 15:6575-6581 (1999). Contact<br>
photolithography was used to make master patterns by patterning either AZ 5214<br>
(CLARIANT, Sommerville, NJ) or SU-8 5 (MCROCHEM, Newton, MA)<br>
photoresists, using 5080 dpi transparencies as an exposure mask. All photoresist<br>
masters used as molds were cleaned using a UVO treatment and treated with<br>
TFOTS (as a mold release agent) in a closed container at around ~150 mTorr for<br>
two hours. Solvents used in processing the samples were of analytical grade or<br>
higher and used without purification.<br>
[0070]      The UV source used for UVO treatments was either a low-pressure<br>
mercury lamp (BHK, Claremont, CA) or a deuterium lamp (Hamamatsu D101BS).<br>
The intensities for each bulb, measured from 230-250 nm using a MIMIR Optical<br>
Powermeter Model 100 were determined to be 100 ÂµW/cm2 at 3 cm distance from<br>
the mercury bulb and 530 ÂµW/cm2 at 1 cm from the deuterium bulb. A 03V5-5<br><br>
ozone generator (OREC, Akron, OH) was used as UV independent source of<br>
ozone.<br>
[0071]      Optical micrographs were recorded using an OLYMPUS BH-2 optical<br>
microscope (OLYMPUS AMERICA, Melville, NY) with PANASONIC GP-<br>
KR222 digital color camera (PANASONIC USA, Seacaucus, NJ). Surface feature<br>
heights and film thicknesses were determined by surface profilometry using a<br>
SLOAN DEKTAK3 ST (VEECO INSTRUMENTS, Histon, Cambs, United<br>
Kingdom). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Dimension<br>
3100 (VEECO), and the images were processed by the manufacturer's V5.12r2<br>
software. Area scans were recorded with unmodified silicon tips in tapping mode<br>
with a tip velocity of 2 Hz or less.<br>
[0072]      Example 1 - Mask Preparation<br>
[0073]      Quartz slides were cleaned in a piranha solution (3:1 H2S04: hydrogen<br>
peroxide 30%) for 10 min, washed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen.<br>
A 30 A titanium layer and a 1000 A thick gold film were deposited onto the<br>
surface of a quartz slide by evaporation using a TEMESCAL FC-1800 Electron<br>
Beam Evaporator (BOC EDWARDS, Wilmington, MA). The deposited metal<br>
layer was patterned into a square planar array of rectangular cavities having<br>
dimensions of 45 microns by 55 microns. This patterning was carried out by<br>
contact photolithography using SU8-5 photoresist. The patterned quartz slide was<br>
cleaned in an oxygen plasma for 15 s, the exposed gold areas were etched in a<br>
dilute (4:1) solution of TFA Gold Etch, and the exposed titanium layer etched by a<br>
1% HF solution. The unstripped layer of the photoresist was retained as part of<br>
the final mask, providing a spacer of SU8-5 resist, with a pitch of one. The resist<br>
layer had a uniform thickness of 17 Âµm.<br><br>
[0074]      Example 2 - Patterning Using Photodefined Cohesive Mechanical<br>
Failure (P-CMF)<br>
[0075]      A molded PDMS stamp was prepared as recommended by DOW<br>
CORNING in the SYLGARD 184 kit, by mixing the oligomer and initiator in a<br>
10:1 ratio. The recommended procedure was modified by reducing the pressure<br>
(50 torr) at room temperature for several minutes with a vacuum oven to remove<br>
entrained gas bubbles. The prepolymer mixture was cast onto a master, and, after<br>
waiting 10 min for the mixture to level, the mixture was cured at 70Â°C for two<br>
hours. The patterned PDMS elastomer was then extracted from the master,<br>
washed with ethanol, and dried under a stream of high purity nitrogen to provide<br>
the PDMS stamp. The final PDMS stamp had a pattern of a square array of posts,<br>
2 urn in diameter with a center-to-center separation of 2.7 Âµm.<br>
[0076]      The PDMS stamp was placed into contact with the patterned side of the<br>
UVO photomask of Example 1 and irradiated through the mask for 4 minutes<br>
using a deuterium lamp. The mask was removed, and the PDMS pattern was<br>
placed into contact with a glass substrate and heated to 70Â°C for 20 minutes. The<br>
PDMS stamp was then removed from the glass substrate using tweezers by peeling<br>
the stamp from a corner.<br>
[0077]      Figure 5A is an optical micrograph of the resulting microstructure, an<br>
array of PDMS posts having the same pattern as the UV-transparent portions of<br>
the mask. The inset of Figure 5A is an image, at the same magnification, of a UV-<br>
transparent opening in the mask. The size and spacing of the domains of the<br>
PDMS posts matched the 45 x 55 micron openings in the mask, with an edge<br>
resolution below the 2.0 micron pixel size of the PDMS posts. Figure 5B is an<br>
atomic force microscopy (AFM) line scan across a domain of posts, indicating that<br>
essentially all the posts had a peak height of approximately 800 nm.<br><br>
[0078]      Example 3 - Use Of P-CMF Pattern As Resist<br>
[0079]      A PDMS stamp was formed as described in Example 2, except with an<br>
unbroken pattern of lines 2 Âµm wide and separated by 2 Âµm spacings. The stamp<br>
was placed into contact with the patterned side of the UVO photomask of Example<br>
1 and irradiated through the mask for 4 minutes using a deuterium lamp. The<br>
mask was removed, and the PDMS pattern was placed into contact with a MPTMS<br>
silanized gold surface having a gold thickness of 100 nm and heated to 70Â°C for 20<br>
minutes. The PDMS stamp was then removed from the substrate using tweezers<br>
by peeling the stamp from a corner. Figures 6A and 6C are optical micrographs of<br>
the resulting microstructure, in which each circular domain (45 x 55 microns) on<br>
the gold surface contained a pattern of 2 Âµm wide lines of PDMS. The AFM line<br>
scan of Figure 6B measured the height of the PDMS lines as approximately 1.6<br>
Âµm.<br>
[0080]      The PDMS pattern was transferred into the gold film by wet etching the<br>
exposed gold layer and the underlying titanium layer. Stripping of the PDMS<br>
resist provided a pattern of gold lines, shown in the optical micrograph of Figure<br>
6D. The gold lines were 2 Âµm wide and were separated by a pitch of one. These<br>
lines were arranged within discrete domains, which matched the PDMS pattern of<br>
Figures 6A and 6C.<br>
[0081 ]      Example 4 - Patterning Using Direct Lithography<br>
[0082]      A flat, unpatterned PDMS slab was formed by casting Sylgard 184 in a<br>
Petri dish at a thickness of 3 mm, and then curing the prepolymer for a minimum<br>
of 2 hrs at 70Â°C. A PDMS blank having approximate dimensions of 2 cm x 3 cm<br>
was cut from this slab, washed with ethanol, and dried with nitrogen. A UVO<br>
photomask was prepared as in Example 1, except that the metal layer was<br>
patterned as 4 Âµm wide lines separated by 4 Âµm spacings. This patterning was<br>
carried out by photolithography using Shipley 1805 resist having a uniform<br>
thickness of 450 nm.<br><br>
[0083]      The planar PDMS blank was placed into contact with the patterned side<br>
of the UVO exposure mask and irradiated through the mask for 6 minutes using a<br>
deuterium lamp. The mask was removed, and the PDMS blank was placed into<br>
contact with a glass substrate and heated to 70Â°C for 20 minutes. The PDMS was<br>
removed from the glass substrate using tweezers by pulling the blank from a<br>
corner.<br>
[0084]      Figures 7A is an AFM image of the resulting microstructure, with the<br>
corresponding AFM line scan in Figure 7B. The microstructure is a pattern of<br>
tapered PDMS lines 4 Âµm wide, approximately 700 run tall, with a separation of 4<br>
urn. Figures 1C and 7D are the AFM image and corresponding AFM line scan of<br>
the PDMS after its removal from the glass substrate. The PDMS blank has the<br>
opposite pattern relative to the microstructure, with trenches approximately 800<br>
nm deep and openings 4 Âµm wide with 4 Âµm spacing.<br>
[0085]      Example 5 - Sub-Micron Patterning Using Direct Lithography<br>
[0086]      A microstructure of PDMS on a glass substrate was formed as<br>
described in Example 4, but using a different UVO photomask. The UVO<br>
photomask was prepared as in Example 4, except that the metal layer was<br>
patterned as 300 nm lines with 300 nm spacings. Figures 8A is an AFM image of<br>
the resulting microstructure, with the corresponding AFM line scan in Figure 8B.<br>
The microstructure is a pattern of tapered PDMS lines approximately 250 nm<br>
wide, with a separation of 350 nm and a variable height.<br>
[0087]      Example 6 - Use Of Direct Lithography Pattern As Resist<br>
[0088]      A UVO photomask was prepared as in Example 4, except that the metal<br>
layer was patterned as 4 Âµm wide lines separated by 10 urn spacings. A planar<br>
PDMS blank was placed in contact with a UVO photomask and irradiated through<br>
the mask for 6 minutes using a deuterium lamp. The blank was then placed into<br>
contact with a MPTMS silanized gold surface having a gold thickness of 100 nm<br>
and heated to 70Â°C for 20 minutes. The PDMS was removed from the substrate<br><br>
using tweezers by peeling the blank from a corner. Figure 9A is an optical<br>
micrograph of the resulting microstructure, having PDMS lines 4.1Âµm wide with<br>
a peak height of 698 nm. The inset of Figure 9A is an AFM image of a single<br>
PDMS line within this microstructure.<br>
[00891      The PDMS pattern was transferred into the gold film by wet etching the<br>
exposed gold layer and the underlying titanium layer. Stripping of the PDMS<br>
resist provided a pattern of gold lines, shown by the optical micrograph of Figure<br>
9B.<br>
[0090]      Example 7 - Use Of Direct Lithography For 3-Dimensional Patterning<br>
[0091]      A UVO photomask was prepared as in Example 4, except that the metal<br>
layer was patterned as 3 Âµm wide lines separated by 3 urn spacings. A planar<br>
PDMS blank was placed in contact with a UVO photomask and irradiated through<br>
the mask for 30 minutes using a deuterium lamp. The blank was then placed into<br>
contact with a glass substrate and heated to 70Â°C for 20 minutes. The PDMS was<br>
removed from the substrate using tweezers by peeling the blank from a corner.<br>
[0092]      A second planar PDMS blank was placed in contact with the same<br>
UVO photomask and irradiated through the mask for 15 minutes using a<br>
deuterium lamp. The PDMS pattern on the glass substrate was also exposed to<br>
UVO for 15 minutes, but without an intervening mask. The second treated blank<br>
was placed into contact with the glass substrate having the PDMS pattern;<br>
however, the second blank was oriented so that the activated lines on the surface<br>
of the second blank were perpendicular to the PDMS lines already on the glass<br>
surface. The entire assembly was heated to 140Â°C for 40 minutes, and the second<br>
PDMS blank was removed using tweezers by peeling the blank from a corner.<br>
Figure 10A is an optical micrograph of the resulting microstructure, having<br>
perpendicular sets of PDMS lines approximately 3 Âµm wide. Figure 10B is an<br>
AFM image of this microstructure, showing the doubled height of the<br>
microstructure at the intersections of the lines.<br><br>
[0093]      Example 8 - Use Of Direct Lithography For Patterning Of Discrete<br>
Material<br>
[0094]      A UVO photomask was prepared as in Example 4, except that the metal<br>
layer was patterned as 100 Âµm x 100 Âµm squares separated by 100 Âµm spacings.<br>
A silicon on insulator wafer (SOI, Janus) was patterned to form a rectangular array<br>
of silicon structures approximately 10 Âµm x 3 Âµm on a silicon dioxide layer.<br>
[0095]      A planar PDMS blank was placed in contact with a UVO photomask<br>
and irradiated through the mask for 6 minutes using a mercury lamp positioned<br>
approximately 3 centimeters from the blank. During this irradiation time, the<br>
patterned SOI wafer etched in a stirred 49% HF solution for 1 minute 35 seconds<br>
to undercut the silicon structures and form single crystal silicon wires having<br>
dimensions of approximately 10 Âµm x 3 Âµm. After removal from the HF solution,<br>
the SOI wafer was rinsed with water and gently blown dry with nitrogen. The<br>
etching step was timed to conclude 45 seconds prior to the end of the 6 minute<br>
UVO exposure. This amount of time was sufficient to rinse, dry, and move the<br>
sample into position for the contact step.<br>
[0096]      The blank was then placed into contact with the patterned face of the<br>
SOI wafer and heated in an oven to 70Â°C for 30 minutes. The assembly was<br>
removed from the oven and placed, with the SOI side down, on a hotplate set at<br>
300Â°C for 20 seconds. The assembly was then submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10<br>
seconds. After allowing the assembly to warm to room temperature for several<br>
seconds, the PDMS was sufficiently flexible and was removed from the substrate<br>
using tweezers by peeling the blank from a corner.<br>
[0097]      Figures 11A and 11B are optical micrographs of the SOI wafer after<br>
patterning by direct lithography. The 100 Âµm x 100 Âµm squares correspond to<br>
regions without any silicon wires. Figures 11C and 11D are optical micrographs<br>
of the PDMS blank, having a pattern of 100 Âµm x 100 Âµm squares containing<br>
arrays of single crystal silicon wires.<br><br>
