				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to glycosides, the salts thereof and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing these glycosides as active ingredients. Furthermore the invention provides a<br>
method of preventing, treating or alleviating the symptoms of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders<br>
of the airways of mammals • including asthma and asthma-related pathologies.<br>
Summary of Related Art<br>
[0002]	Inflammation is a multi-step cascade process, any part of which may be the subject of<br>
potential merapeutic intervention. Briefly, inflammation entails the infiltration of immunologically<br>
competent cells (for example eosinophils, mast cells, activated T-lymphocytes) into the injury she where<br>
they, together with resident cells, release bioactrve mediator substances (e.g., histamine, proteases, a host<br>
of cytokines and chemokines), which increase the permeability of nearby blood vessels, attract and<br>
stimulate bystander cells. The altered permeability of vessels resorts in a fluid exudate forming at the<br>
injury she followed by a further influx of reactive leukocytes and their eventual efflux into the damaged<br>
area. (For an overview see, Trowbridge and Emling, Inflammation: A Review of the Process<br>
Quintessence Pub. Co, 1997). Secretion of collagen and mucus by, and proliferation of, resident cells<br>
(smooth muscle and epithelial cells or fibroblasts stimulated by the released mediators) establish the<br>
extension of pathological alterations (e.g„ airway obstruction) and contribute to their development.<br>
[0003]	Inflammation is associated with a variety of pulmonary conditions including e.g.,<br>
intrinsic or extrinsic asthma bronchiale, any inflammatory lung disease, acute or chronic bronchitis,<br>
pulmonary inflammatory reactions secondary to chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive lung disease,<br>
pulmonary fibrosis, as well as any pulmonary condition in which white blood cells may play a role<br>
including, but not limited to, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and any other autoimmune lung disease.<br>
Asthma is one of the most common forms of pulmonary inflammation affecting the large and small<br>
airways of the lung. It impacts on 5% to 10% of the human population, resulting in an estimated 27<br>
million patient visits, 6 million lost workdays, and 90.5 million days of restricted activity per year. The<br>
morbidity and mortality rates for asthma are growing worldwide (Plaut and Zimmerman, "Allergy and<br><br>
Mechanisms of Hypersensitivity" in Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed., Paul (ed.), Raven Press, New<br>
York, NY, at 1399 (1993)).<br>
[0004]	Conventional anti-asthma treatments have been predicated on the strict avoidance of all<br>
triggering allergens, which is inherently difficult to achieve, and on therapeutic regimens based on<br>
pharmacological agents having unfortunate side effects and suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties. β2-<br>
adrenergic agonists used to treat bronchospasm have no effect on airway inflammation or bronchial<br>
hyperreactivity (Palmer et al, New Engl J. Med. 331:1314 (1994)). Also, regular or prolonged use of β2-<br>
adrenergic agonists is associated with poor control of asthma, increase in airway hyperresponsiveness to<br>
allergen, and reduced bronchoconstriction protection (Bhagat et al, Chest 108:1235 (1995)). Moreover,<br>
chronic use of β2-adrenergic agents alone, by causing down regulation of β2-adrenergic receptors, is<br>
suspected to worsen bronchial hyperreactivity. Theophylline (an anti-asthma methylxanthine) is<br>
characterized by substantial variability in its absorbance and clearance. Corticosteroids, while relatively<br>
safe in adult patients, are toxic for children, resulting in adrenal suppression and reduced bone density<br>
and growth (Woolock et al, am. Respir. Crit Care Med. 153:1481 (1996)). Cromolyn, used to prevent<br>
asthmatic episodes, is effective in preventing an asthmatic reaction only if given prior to an attack<br>
(Volcheck et al, Postgrad Med 104(3):127 (1998)). Antihstaroines occasionally prevent or abort<br>
allergic asthmatic episodes, particularly in children, but often are only partially effective because<br>
histamines are only one of many inflammation associated mediators (Cuss, "The Pharmacology of<br>
Antiasthma Medications", in Asthma as an Inflammatory Disease. O'Byrne, Ed., Dekker, Inc., New<br>
York, at 199 (1990)) and O'Byme, "Airway Inflammation and Asthma", in Asthma as an Inflammatory<br>
Disease. O'Byme, Ed., Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, 143 (1990)).<br>
[0005]	Thus, current drug modalities suffer from a number of drawbacks. In general,<br>
conventional agents have a relatively short duration of action and may be partially or wholly ineffective<br>
when administered after antigen challenge occurs. Moreover, because of serious adverse effects<br>
associated with the use of agents such as β2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids, therapeutic margins<br>
of safety with such agents are relatively narrow and patients using such agents must be carefully<br>
monitored (see e.g., WO 94/06783, WO 99/06025, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,690,910 and 5,980,865). In a<br>
recent clinical study, of inhaled corticosteroids, only transient improvement occurred in the airways<br>
function of 5-11-year-old asthmatic children after the first year of therapy, with regression to that<br>
observed with placebo over the next 3 years (The Childhood Asthma Management Program Research<br>
Group, N. Engl. J. Med, 343:1054 (2000)). This regression can best be explained by remodeling changes<br>
(characteristic feature of asthma) occurring in me airways that are refractory to corticosteroids (Davies,<br>
Cvrr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol, 1:67 (2001)).<br>
[0006]	It is known from relevant literature, that certain mixtures of polysulfated disaccharides<br>
- having structures closely related to those of the present invention and which were synthesized by<br><br>
nitrous acid treatment of such natural products as for example heparin or heparin sulfate, followed by<br>
reduction with borohydride and subsequent sulfation of the partially purified samples (US .5,690,910; US<br>
5,980,865 and WO 02/083700) - displayed remarkable anti-inflammatory effect in different asthma<br>
models.<br>

[0035]	As used in this specification, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" specifically also<br>
encompass the plural forms of the terms to which they refer, unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
For example, reference to "a modulator" includes mixtures of modulators.<br>
[0036]	As used in this specification, whether in a transitional phrase or in the body of the claim,<br>
the terms "comprise(s)" and "comprising" are to be interpreted as having an open-ended meaning. That<br>
is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases "having at least" or "including at leasf'.<br>
When used in the context of a process, the term "comprising" means that the process includes at least the<br>
recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition,<br>
the term "comprising" means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or<br>
components, but may also include additional features or components.<br>
[0037]	The term "about" is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly, or<br>
around. When the term "about" is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by<br>
extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the term "about" is<br>
used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.<br>
[0038]	As used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the word "or" is used in the<br>
"inclusive" sense of "and/or" and not the "exclusive" sense of "either/or."<br>
[0039]	As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" are used to indicate reducing,<br>
alleviating, preventing, inhibiting the develpment of and/or reversing the symptoms of a condition.<br>
Conditions to be treated by the methods and compositions of the invention include any condition<br><br>
characterized by, or including, acute and chronic inflammatory disorders of the airways. Hence, the terms<br>
"inflammatory disorder" or "inflammatory disorders of the airways" encompass any inflammatory lung<br>
disease, including asthma, intrinsic or extrinsic asthma bronchiale, acute chronic bronchitis, allergic<br>
rhinitis, pulmonary inflammatory and structural reactions secondary to chronic bronchitis, chronic<br>
obstructive lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis. The invention is also useful for pulmonary condition in<br>
which white blood cells and airway remodeling may play a role including but not limited to idiopathic<br>
pulmonary fibrosis and any other autoimmune lung disease.<br>
[0040]	By "asthma" is meant a condition of allergic origins, the symptoms of which include<br>
continuous or paroxysmal labored breathing accompanied by wheezing, a sense of constriction in the<br>
chest, and often attacks of coughing or gasping. By "asthma-related pathology" is meant a condition<br>
whose symptoms are predominantly inflammatory in nature with associated bronchospasm. Hence, both<br>
asthma and asthma-related pathologies are characterized by symptoms that include narrowing of airways,<br>
due in varying degrees to contraction (spasm) of smooth muscle, edema of the mucosa, including that of<br>
the upper airways and mucus in the lumen of the bronchi and bronchioles. Non-limiting representative<br>
examples of "asthma-related pathologies" include non-asthmatic conditions characterized by airway<br>
hyperresponsiveness (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cystic fibrosis and respiratory distress).<br>
[0041]	Compositions and methods taught herein are exemplified, for asthma. However, the<br>
invention should not be construed as limited to this particular pulmonary disease. Asthma offers the<br>
advantage of having been studied extensively and provides several accepted models to evaluate the<br>
invention. It is known that sensitization and allergen challenge leads to airway hyperresponsiveness to<br>
various agonists. Hence, acetylcholine, known as a spasmogenic agent, is capable of inducing larger<br>
contractions of the muscle cells in tissues obtained from the trachea of sacrificed animals (which had<br>
been sensitized to provoke airway hyper-responsiveness) than from control animals following allergen<br>
challenge (see, e.g. Tokuoka et at, Br. J. Pharmacol. 134:1580 (2001); Nakata et at, Int. Immunol.<br>
13:329 (2001); Emala and Hirshman, Monogr. Allergy 33:35 (1996)).<br>
[0042]	The most prominent characteristic of asthma is bronchospasm, or narrowing of the<br>
airways. Asthmatic patients have prominent contraction of the smooth muscles of large and small<br>
airways, increased mucus production, and increased inflammation (Plaut and Zimmerman, supra). The<br>
inflammatory response in asthma is typical for tissues covered by a mucosa and is characterized by<br>
vasodilation, plasma exudation, recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes,<br>
macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils to the sites of inflammation, and the release of inflammatory<br>
mediators by resident tissue cells (e.g., mast cells or airways epithelial cells) or by migrating<br>
inflammatory cells (Hogg, 'Pathology of Asthma", in Asthma as an Inflammatory Disease. O'Byrne<br>
(ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY, at 1 (1990)). Asthma may be triggered by a variety of causes<br>
such as allergic reactions, a secondary response to infections, industrial or occupational exposures,<br><br>
ingestion of certain chemicals or drugs, exercise (Hargreave et at, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 83:1013<br>
(1986)).<br>
[0043]	The compounds of formula (3) according to the invention have also been found effective<br>
to decrease mucus production of bronchial epithelial cells and to inhibit growth factor mediated<br>
proliferation of smooth muscle cells.<br>
[0044]	An increase in bronchial hyperreactivity (AHR), the hallmark of a more severe form of<br>
asthma, can be induced by both airway antigenic and non-antigenic stimuli. Late phase response and<br>
persistent hyperresponsiveness in allergen-induced asthma have been associated with the recruitment of<br>
leukocytes, and particularly eosinophils, to inflamed lung tissue (Abraham et at, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis.<br>
138:1565 (1988)). Eosinophils release several inflammatory mediators including 1S-HETE, leukotriene<br>
C4, PAF, cationic proteins, eosinophil peroxidase.<br>
[0045]	The terms "antigen" and "allergen" are used interchangeably to describe those<br>
molecules, such as dust or pollen that can induce an allergic reaction and/or induce asthmatic symptoms<br>
in an individual suffering from asthma. Thus, an asthmatic individual "challenged" with an allergen or an<br>
antigen is exposed to a sufficient amount of the allergen or antigen to induce an asthmatic response. The<br>
compounds of formula (I) according to the invention have been found effective to treat AHR subsequent<br>
to ovalbumin sensitization and antigen challenge.<br>
[0046]	The biological activity of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention in<br>
different animal models is demonstrated below:<br>
Model 1<br>
Examination of the effect of locally administered polysulfated glycosides on airways' hyperβ2-<br>
responsiveness ex vivo<br>
[0047]	Inflammation of the airways may lead to bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which is a<br>
characteristic feature of asthma.<br>
[0048]	Brown Norway (EN) rats were actively sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) by a subcutaneous<br>
injection of 0.5 ml of OA/Al(OH)3 gel mixture (2 mg OA +10 g A1(OH)3/100 ml saline) on day 1 with<br>
subsequent subcutaneous injections (10 mg OA + 10 g A1(OH)3/100 ml saline) given on days 14 and 21.<br>
On day 28, animals received the compound described in example 4 intratracheally (0.01; 0.1 or 1.0<br>
mg/kg dose) 2 hours before antigen challenge. Antigen challenge was performed by inhalation of<br>
nebulised ovalbumin (1% antigen solution administered in a TSE inhalation system for 1 hour). Animals<br>
were sacrificed 48 hours post antigen challenge wherein the tracheas were removed to an organ bath.<br><br>
Dissected tracheas were allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes before measuring tracheal spasmogenic<br>
response curves to acetylcholine (Ach).<br>
[0049]	As shown in Table 1 ovalbumin challenge of sensitized animals in this model caused a<br>
significant tracheal hyper-reactivity to acetylcholine, when the response to the spasmogenic agent was<br>
determined 48 h after antigen challenge. The compound described in example 4 in a dose of 0.01 mg/kg,<br>
brought this elevation back almost to control level.<br><br>
* -log M acetylcholine (Ach), causing 50% contraction relative to control (mean ± SEM)<br>
** Contraction at maximal Ach concentration relative to control (mean ± SEM)<br>
Model 2.<br>
Examination of the effect of polysulfated glycosides on the allergen stimulated mucus production of<br>
airways epithelial cells.<br>
[0050]	In a sensitized animal antigenic challenge results in mucus production of airways<br>
epithelial cells, which is a characteristic feature of allergic asthma.<br>
[0051]	Sensitized BN rats were treated intratracheally with varying (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) dose of<br>
compound described in example 4, two hours before antigenic challenge, using a similar protocol<br><br>
described in Model 1. Lungs were collected 48 hours after challenge and were fixed in 8% phosphate<br>
buffered formaldehyde. Samples were then processed for histochemistry routinely. 5 µm thick sections<br>
were stained with periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) reagents and were counterstained with haematoxylin-<br>
eosine. On the sections each epithelial cells of the airways were counted in the whole preparation at a<br>
magnification of 400x. The number of PAS{+) [mucus producing] epithelial cells was expressed as the<br>
ratio of the total number of epithelial cells.<br>
[0052]	As it is shown in Table 2, allergen challenge stimulates the mucus production of airways<br>
epithelial cells (control vs. challenge). The compound significantly decreased the number of PAS(+),<br>
mucus producing cells at the applied higher dose.<br><br>
Model 3.<br>
Examination of the effect of polysulfated glycosides on the extent of perivascular oedema developed in<br>
asthmatic lung tissue.<br>
[0053]	In a sensitized animal antigen challenge, as a result of the developing inflammatory<br>
processes, increases the permeability of the blood vessels resulting in plasma excudation around the<br>
periphery of the vasculature.<br>
[0054]	Sensitized BN rats were treated intratracheally with varying (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) dose of<br>
compound described in example 4, two hours before antigenic challenge, using a similar protocol<br>
described in Model 1. Lungs were collected 48 hours after challenge and were fixed in 8% phosphate<br><br>
buffered formaldehyde. Samples were then processed for histochemistry routinely. 5 µm thick sections<br>
were stained with periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) reagents and were counterstained with haematoxylin-<br>
eosine. On the 5 µm sections, the area of the connective tissue around the vasculare was determined and<br>
expresssed as a ratio of the area of the corresponding blood vessel itself.<br>
[0055]	As it is shown in Table 3, allergen challenge causes aedema around the vasculature, the<br>
extent of which was significantly decreased even at the smallest dose of the examined compound.<br><br>
Model 4.<br>
IP-3 receptor antagonistic effect of polysulfated glycosides<br>
[0056]	Glycosides of the present invention, depending on their chemical structure, inhibit the<br>
binding of inositol-l,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to its receptor in microsomal membrane preparations. As<br>
EP3 is a messenger molecule playing distinguished role in the activation of different cells, interfering with<br>
this function can explain the anti-asthmatic effect of these polysulfated glycosides.<br>
[0057]	The IP3 antagonist effect of the polysulfated glycosides were determined using rat<br>
cerebellum membrane preparations according to Worley et al. (JBC 262, 12132, 1987). As is shown in<br>
Table 4, all the compounds described in Examples 1-16 possess varying IP3 antagonist activity.<br><br><br>
[0058]	The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are intended for use with any<br>
mammal that may experience the benefits of the methods of the invention. Foremost among such<br>
mammals are humans, although the invention is not intended to be so limited, and is applicable to<br>
veterinary uses. Thus, in accordance with the invention, "mammal" or "mammal in need" include<br>
humans as well as non-human mammals, particularly domesticated animals including, without limitation, .<br>
cats, dogs, and horses.<br><br>
[0059]	The term "therapeutically effective amount" is used to denote treatments at dosages<br>
effective to achieve the therapeutic result sought. Furthermore, one of skill will appreciate that the<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention may be lowered or increased hy fine-<br>
tuning and/or by administering more than one compound of the invention, or by administering a<br>
compound of the invention with another anti-asthmatic compound (e.g., corticosteroid). The invention<br>
therefore provides a method to tailor the administration/treatment to the particular exigencies specific to a<br>
given mammal. As illustrated in the following examples, therapeutically effective amounts may be easily<br>
determined for example empirically by starting at relatively low amounts and by step-wise increments<br>
with concurrent evaluation of beneficial effect. Clinical changes relevant to assess the therapeutic effect<br>
of treatment according to the invention include reduction in the characteristic symptoms and signs of<br>
asthma and related pathologies (e.g., dyspnea, wheezing, cough, bronchial hypersensitivity airway<br>
remodeling) and improvement of pulmonary function tests. These are based upon patient' s symptoms and<br>
physician's observations.<br>
[0060]	As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey<br>
that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus,<br>
for a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical<br>
range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is inherently continuous, the<br>
variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As<br>
an example, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0,1 or 2 for variables<br>
which are inherently discrete, and can be 0.0,0.1,0.01,0.001, or any other real value for variables which<br>
are inherently continuous.<br>
[0061]	For local administration by inhalation for example, contemplated therapeutically<br>
effective amounts are from about 0.1 µg/kg/day to about 1000 µg/kg/day when administered systemically<br>
(e.g., orally administered). In an embodiment of the invention, when systemically administered,<br>
therapeutically effective amounts are from about 0.5 µg/kg/day to about 200 µg/kg/day.<br>
[0062]	. Dosage forms and frequency of administration of the same, will depend on conventional<br>
factors routinely considered by one of skill in the field to obtain therapeutically effective amounts as<br>
discussed above in a given mammal. Hence, a practitioner will consider the condition being treated, the<br>
particular compound of the invention being administered, route of administration, and other clinical<br>
factors such as age, weight and condition of the mammal as well as convenience and patient compliance.<br>
[0063]	It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the number of administrations of the<br>
compounds according to the invention will vary from patient to patient based on the particular medical<br>
status of that patient at any given time.<br><br>
[0064]	When applicable (such as for the treatment of asthma, for example) the compound<br>
according to this aspect of the invention, may be administered prior to, at the same time, or after the<br>
mammal has been exposed to an antigen. In addition, the timing of the administration of the compound<br>
of the invention with relation to the exposure to an antigen will vary from mammal to mammal<br>
depending on the particular situation. A skilled practitioner "will optimize administration by careful<br>
monitoring the patient while altering the timing and/or the order of administration of the compound of the<br>
invention. Hence, it will be understood that the mammal need not suffer from a pulmonary inflammation<br>
to benefit from the invention. The compounds of the invention may be administered prophylactically to<br>
individuals predisposed to develop asthma and/or an asthma-related pathology. For example, an<br>
individual allergic to pollen may be administered a compound of the invention (e.g., by oral<br>
administration) on a daily basis and/or prior to going to a pollen-rich area (e.g., a garden). Likewise, an<br>
individual with only a family history of asthmatic attacks may be administered the compounds of the<br>
invention prophylactically - to prevent or inhibit possible onset of such an asthmatic attack.<br>
[0065]	Based on the above facts, the present invention also provides a method of treating acute<br>
and chronic inflammatory disorders of the airways of mammals -including asthma and asthma-related<br>
pathologies. This method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I)<br>
[0066]	The compounds according to the invention are optimally formulated in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle with any of the well-known pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
including diluents and excipients (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 18* Ed., Gennaro, Mack<br>
Publishing Co., Easton, PA 1990 and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Lippincott,<br>
Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1995). While the type of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier/vehicle employed in<br>
generating the compositions of the invention will vary depending upon the mode of administration of the<br>
composition to a mammal, generally pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are physiologically inert and<br>
non-toxic. Formulations of compositions according to the invention may contain more than one type of<br>
compound of the invention, as well as any other pharmacologically active ingredient useful for the<br>
treatment of the particular pulmonary inflammation being treated. Such compounds may include without<br>
limitation, β-andrenoceptor antagonists: albuterol, metaproteranol, levalbuterol, pirbuterol, salmeterol,<br>
bitolterol; glucocorticoids: beclomethasone, triamcinolone, flunisolide, budesonide, fluticasone;<br>
ieukotriene-receptor antagonists and leukotriene-synthesis inhibitors: zafirlukast, montelukast, zileutin;<br>
other anti-asthmatics: cromolyn, nedocromil, theophylline; anti-cholinergic agents: ipatropium,<br>
oxitropium, tiotropium; H1 receptor antagonist anti-histamines: diphenydramine, pyrilamine,<br>
promethazine, loratidine, chlorocyclizine, chlorophemiramine, fexofenadine and adrenocorticosteroids.<br>
[0067]	The compositions of the invention can be administered by standard routes (e.g. oral,<br>
inhalation, rectal, nasal, topical, including buccal and sublingual, or parenteral, including subcutaneous,<br><br>
intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, transdermal, and intratracheal). In addition, polymers may be<br>
added according to standard methodologies in the art for sustained release of a given compound.<br>
[0068]	Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include formulations that can be<br>
dispensed by inhalation devices known to those in the art. Such formulations may include carriers such as<br>
powder and aerosols. The present invention encompasses liquid and powdered compositions suitable for<br>
nebulization and intrabronchial use, or aerosol compositions administered via an aerosol unit dispensing<br>
metered doses ("MDI'). Particularly preferred devices contemplated are described in U.S. Patent No.:<br>
5,447,150.<br>
[0069]	The active ingredient may be formulated in an aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inhalant vehicle, such as, for example, isotonic saline or bacterostatic water and other types of vehicles<br>
that are well known in the art. The solutions are administered by means of a pump or squeeze-actuated<br>
nebulized spray dispenser, or by any other conventional means for causing or enabling the requisite<br>
dosage amount of the liquid composition to be inhaled into the patient's lungs.<br>
[0070]	Powder compositions containing the anti-inflammatory compounds of the present<br>
invention include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable powdered preparations of the<br>
active ingredient thoroughly intermixed with lactose or other inert powders acceptable for intrabronchial<br>
administration. The powder compositions can be administered via a dispenser, including, but not limited<br>
to, an aerosol dispenser or encased in a breakable capsule, which may be inserted by the patient into a<br>
device that punctures the capsule and blows the powder out in a steady stream.<br>
10071]	Aerosol formulations for use in the subject method typically include propellants,<br>
surfactants, and co-solvents and may be filled into conventional aerosol containers that are closed by a<br>
suitable metering valve.<br>
(0072]	For oral administration, the anti-inflammatory compositions of the invention may be<br>
presented as discrete units such as capsules, caplets, gelcaps, cachets, pills, or tablets each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in<br>
an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil<br>
emulsion and as a bolus, etc. Alternately, administration of a composition of all of the aspects of the<br>
present invention may be effected by liquid solutions, suspensions or elixirs, powders, lozenges,<br>
micronized particles and osmotic delivery systems.<br>
[0073]	Formulations of compositions of the present invention suitable for nasal administration,<br>
wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of<br>
20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is administered, i.e. by rapid<br>
inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable<br><br>
formulations, wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration, for example via a nasal spray, aerosol, or<br>
as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the compound of the invention. Semi-liquid<br>
formulations, such as a nasal gel, are also suitable.<br>
[0074]	Formulations of compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and<br>
non-aqueous sterile injection solutions "which may contain antioxidants, stabilizers, buffers, bacteriostats<br>
and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
[0075]	The process for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (IA), (IB) and (IC),<br>
which are stereochemically defined representatives of compounds of the general formula (I) of the<br>
present invention, is illustrated by the following examples.<br><br>

thereof are demonstrated below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The donor molecules used in the glycosylation reactions are either commercially available, for example<br>
the compound of formula (X)<br><br>
or can be synthesized by known methods (see experimental part), for example compounds of formula<br>
(XXX), (L) and (LIV).<br><br><br>
[0076]	The Rf values given in the examples were determined by thin layer chromatography<br>
using silica gel (DC-Alufolien Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt) and the following mixtures of<br>
solvents:<br>
(4) Ethyl acetate - hexane 1:1<br>

[0077]	The spots were detected either in UV light or by spraying the plates with a 1:1 mixture of<br>
0.1 M KMn04 -1 M H2SO4 followed by heating to 200 °C. Column chromatography was performed on<br>
Kieselgel 60. Optical rotations were measured at 20 °C. NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker Avance<br>
500 MHz spectrometer using Me4Si as the internal standard. The assignments of the protons were based<br>
on COSY, 2D and selective ID TOCSY as well as selective ID NOESY experiments. Multiplicities of<br>
the 13C spectra were obtained from DEPT experiments. Connectivities between identified protons and<br>
protonated carbons were observed by means of HMQC and HMBC experiments.<br><br>
[0078J	In the case of acylation reactions carried out in the presence of pyridine the "usual work-<br>
up" means that if the product is not crystalline after pouring the reaction mixture into ice-water, it is<br>
extracted with an organic solvent, the organic layer is washed with water, 1 M ice-cold aqueous sulfuric<br>
acid solution until permanent acidity, water, 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and water, dried,<br>
filtered and the solvent is evaporated in vacuum.<br>

Ber. 68 (1935) 18-24) in 150 ml of dimethylformamide 20 ml (0.26 mol) of 2;2-dimethoxypropane and<br>
100 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid were added at room temperature. After stirring for 10 min a clear<br>

[0081]	To a solution of 3.1 g (10 mmol) of the product of formula (XI) obtained in the previous<br>
step in 50 ml of acetonitrile 7 g of molecular sieves (4 A) was added and the mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 30 min. Then 4.5 g (11 mmol) of acetobromo-D-glucose (X) and 3 g (12 mmol) of<br>
Hg(CN)2 were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 h. Then the reaction mixture<br>

[0082]	To a solution of 4.1 g of the product of formula (XII) obtained in the previous step in 40<br>
ml of methanol 0.5 ml of 2 M sodium methoxide solution in methanol was added at room temperature.<br><br>
After 2 h sodium ions were removed by addition of cation exchange resin, the mixture was filtered and<br>
the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (solvent G) to yield<br>
