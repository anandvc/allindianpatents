The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates to herbicidal  formulations  comprising<br>
acifluorfen sodium.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The protection of crops from weeds and other vegetation which inhibit crop growth is a constantly recurring problem in agriculture. To help combat this problem, researchers in the field of synthetic chemistry have produced an extensive variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in the control of such unwanted growth. Chemical herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a large number are in commercial use.<br>
Selective herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often synthetic "imitations" of plant hormones. Herbicides used to clear waste ground, industrial sites, railways and railway embankments are nonselective and kill all plant material with which they come into contact.<br>
Unfortunately, many of such herbicides exhibit phytotoxicity to the desired crop as well as to the weeds or grasses sought to be controlled. Phytotoxic means harmful or lethal to plants. Phytotoxicity is the degree to which a chemical or other compound is toxic to plants. Phytotoxic effects caused by herbicides can be from spray droplets, soil residues or vapors contacting sensitive plants. Plants can also be harmed by herbicides which move off target in water or soil or when sensitive crops are planted in fields too soon after a herbicide treatment was applied for a previous crop.<br>
Phytotoxic effects ranges from slight burning or browning of leaves to death of the plant. Sometimes the damage appears as leaf cupping, crinkling and speckling, distorted leaves, fruit, flowers or stems. Damage symptoms vary with the herbicide and the type of plant that has been affected.<br><br>
US Patent 4 063 929 discloses, novel diphenyl ether herbicides including Acifiuorfen acid, 5-(2-chloro-4-trifluoromethyl-phertoxy)-2-nitrobenzoic acid, and its agrochemically acceptable salts. Acifiuorfen sodium is a selective contact diphenyl ether herbicide, which exhibits both pre and post-emergence weed control. This herbicide is effective for control of broad leaved weeds with some effects on grasses in soybeans, peanuts, peas and rice. Despite being a selective herbicide, its phyototoxic action or phytotoxicity on desired crop is reported in the literature.<br>
An article in Journal of Agriculture and food chemistry, 1983, 31(4), pp-751- 755 entitled "Acifiuorfen increases the leaf content of phytoalexins and stress metabolites in several crops" teaches that leaves treated with acifiuorfen sodium contain greatly increased levels of N-feruloyl- 3-methoxytyramine (spinach) and of 10 phytoalexins i.e. glyceollins I, II, and III and glyceofuran (soybean), phasedlin (bean and pinto bean), pisatin (pea), medicarpin and wyerone (broad bean), xanthotoxin (celery), and hemigossypol (cotton). Enhanced synthesis of these compounds is related to acifiuorfen concentration and exposure to light. The phytotoxicity of acifiuorfen to spinach is counteracted by appropriate treatments with (aminooxy) acetic acid, L-2-(aminooxy)-3-phenylpropionic acid or silver nitrate and by heat shock. Under certain conditions soybean injury is ameliorated by combining (aminooxy) acetic acid with acifiuorfen and silver nitrate with oxyfluorfen.<br>
Weed Science, 1989, Vol 37: 743-747 entitled "Acifiuorfen action on growth and phenolic metabolism in soybean (glycine max) seedlings, by Robert E" teaches that acifluorfen is a potent herbicide, but despite considerable studies to elucidate its mode of action, mechanism of  its phytotoxicity is not fully understood. Light and oxygen are required for the development of maximal herbicidal symptoms of acifiuorfen but photosynthesis is not involved. However, respiration and photosynthesis in soybean protoplasts and mitochondria are inhibited by low levels of acifiuorfen. Acifiuorfen exerts its major effects through<br><br>
toxic products formed following light activation, lipid peroxidation, activated by photosynthetic electron transport and tetrapyrrole accumulation, is among more recent explanations of phytotoxicity. Acifluorfen affects growth and phenyl propanoid metabolism in soybean and spinach.<br>
Acifluorfen sodium is formulated as Soluble Liquid (SL) formulation and is registered and marketed under the brand name of Blazer. However, Acifluorfen sodium soluble liquid formulation (marketed as Blazer ®) is also known to produce phytotoxicity to desired crop. It shows the signs of phytotoxicity like leaf scorching, cupping, crinkling and speckling. Such damage affects the quality and overall yield of the desired crop.<br>
Therefore, there is a long felt need in the art for acifluorfen sodium formulations that solves the problem of phytotoxicity. Hitherto, no attempts have been made to solve the phytotoxicity of acifluorfen sodium.<br>
The present invention provides such formulations of acifluorfen sodium that are non-phytotoxic.<br>
Further, Acifluorfen sodium is a selective contact diphenyl ether herbicide, which exhibits both pre and post-emergence weed control. A common problem with selective herbicides is that its weed control spectrum, that is, the range of weed species effectively controlled by the herbicide, does not embrace the full diversity of weeds present in a crop. It has therefore been common to apply two or more herbicides simultaneously in order to achieve the desired spectrum of control.<br>
United States Patent No. 4713109 teaches a 2-propynyl ester of the compound 2- (4- (3-Chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridyloxy)-phenoxy-propionic acid, which is commonly known as clodinafop-propargyl, a compound possessing demonstrated herbicidal activity against grassy weeds in winter cereals specially<br><br>
in wheat and barley as well as pulses. It is a member of the oxy phenoxy acid ester class of herbicides. It is known that clodinafop propargyl interacts with and inhibits the acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase, which is essential for the production of lipids or fatty acids needed for plant growth. The selectivity of this herbicide is based on the difference in the speed of herbicide breakdown in the crop versus the weeds. Clodinafop-propargyl converts from the ester form to the active acid and then to biologically inactive compounds. Grass weeds such as wild oats and wild millet cannot effectively break down clodinafop-propargyl, so they are controlled as a lethal dose accumulates at the meristematic growing points. This is a post emergence, selective systemic grass herbicide and is known to control grasses such as green foxtail, barnyard grass, Persian darnel and volunteer canary seed in wheat crops. However, it is known that clodinafop propargyl is ineffective against several broad leaved weeds.<br>
There is a further need in the art to provide synergistic herbicide compositions as they afford various advantages. Herbicide combinations offer advantages of improved weed control, a greater spectrum of weeds controlled, reduced cost and reduced residue problems.<br>
The   present   invention   also   provides   such   a   synergistic   herbicidal composition of clodinafop-propargyl and acifluorfen sodium.<br>
It was further found that a major problem with clodinafop-propargyl is that it undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of an aqueous medium in acidic environment rendering it incapable of being formulated as stable formulation along with acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium as a stable soluble liquid formulation.<br>
US Patent 4285723 discloses, selective diphenyl  ether herbicides including<br>
fomesafen,	5-(2-chloro-α,α,α-trifluoro-p-tolyloxy)-N-mesyl-2-<br>
nitrobenzenecarboximidate, and its agrochemically acceptable salts.   Fomesafen<br><br>
sodium is a selective early post emergent herbicide used to control broad leaved weeds in soybean.<br>
US Patent No. 6369001 provides a liquid concentrate herbicidal microemulsion composition comprising water; a water-soluble herbicide and an oil-soluble cyclohexenone or aryloxyphenoxypropionate graminicide. This patent discloses many examples of water soluble herbicide such as acifiuorfen and fomesafen and oil soluble cyclohexenone such as Clodinafop-propargyl. However, it does not teach the selective combinations of acifiuorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl. Further, this patent does not address and solve the specific degradation problem of Clodinafop- propargyl, particularly in an aqueous environment. It was found that liquid concentrates or water based formulations comprising clodinafop- propargyl and acifiuorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium have poor stability and aggravate the problem of degradation of clodinafop-propargyl.<br>
Acifiuorfen sodium and fomesafen sodium are known to produce phytotoxicity to desired crop. Fomesafen sodium is formulated as Microemulsion (ME) and Soluble Liquid (SL) formulation. It is registered and marketed under the brand name of Flexstar and Reflex and its existing formulations also suffer from the disadvantage of phytotoxicity.<br>
The present inventors have also found that soluble liquid, wettable powder, water dispersible granules and also tank mixtures including acifiuorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium with Clodinafop propargyl causes phytotoxicity on desired crops. Therefore, there is need in the art to provide a formulation of acifiuorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium with Clodinafop propargyl that causes no phytotoxicity.<br>
Therefore, there is a long felt need in the art to provide a stable formulation   comprising   clodinafop   propargyl   and   acifiuorfen   sodium   or<br><br>
fomesafen sodium that solves the problems of degradation of clodinafop propargyl in aqueous medium and solves the existing problem of phytotoxicity induced by these active ingredients.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to provide a formulation of clodinafop- propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium that surprisingly meets the challenge of providing a storage stable formulation clodinafop- propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium which is also non phytotoxic. Hitherto, no successful attempts have been made to formulate an emulsifiable concentrate of acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and cloduiafop-propargyl. The present invention provides such a storage stable agrochemical emulsifiable concentrate of clodinafop-propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium that causes no phytotoxicity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
It is thus known in the art that aqueous based formulations such as soluble liquid (SL) of acifluorfen sodium are phytotoxic. The present inventors have also found that in addition to aqueous based formulations, wettable powder and water dispersible granules of acifluorfen sodium are also phytotoxic.<br>
Hitherto, no attempt has been made in the art to solve the problem of phytotoxicity of acifluorfen sodium formulations. The present inventors have unexpectedly and surprisingly found that an emulsifiable concentrate formulation of acifluorfen sodium is non-phytotoxic.<br>
However, it is known in the art that there is a great difficulty in preparing an emulsifiable concentrate when the active ingredient is a water-soluble herbicide such as acifluorfen sodium. It is believed that emulsifiable concentrates of water soluble active ingredients such as acifluorfen sodium are difficult to formulate because of their low solubility in conventional non polar medium used<br><br>
for making emulsifiable concentrates. Further, emulsifiable concentrates are suitable for limited number of active ingredients only. Many active ingredients are not soluble enough to be supplied economically in this form. Hitherto, no attempts have been made in the prior art to prepare emulsifiable concentrate of acifluorfen sodium.<br>
A person skilled in the art would expect a water soluble herbicide to dissolve in water and only partially soluble in an organic solvent. It was unexpectedly and surprisingly found that it is indeed possible to form an emulsifiable concentrate formulation comprising acifluorfen sodium in the solvent system contemplated according to the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present inventors set about providing an emulsion concentrate of acifluorfen sodium that are non- phytotoxic.<br>
Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention provides a non- phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium.<br>
The term "agrochemically effective amount" is that quantity of active agent, applied in any amount which will provide the required control of broad leaved weeds and grasses. The particular amount is dependent upon many factors including, for example, the crop, weeds sought to be controlled and environmental conditions. The selection of the proper quantity of active agent to be applied, however, is within the expertise of one skilled in the art.<br>
In an embodiment, the agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium comprises from about 0.01% to about 40% and preferably from about 0.1% to about 35% of the total weight of the compositions according to the present invention.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, acifluorfen sodium comprises from about 15.5% to about 30 % and more preferably about 16.5% of the total weight of the compositions according to the present invention.<br>
It was unexpectedly found by the present inventors that organic solvents having dielectric constants in predetermined ranges when used in combination in a specific weight ratio played a major role in providing emulsifiable concentrate with desired emulsifiability, solubility profile and stability.<br>
In an embodiment, the non-phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention comprise further ingredients selected from an organic solvent having a dielectric constant from about 12 to about 50, another organic solvent having a dielectric constant from about 1 to about 4, an emulsifying agent, a stabilizer and the like.<br>

The said solvent may be preferably selected from cyclohexanone, N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetophenone, dimethyl formamide, MIBK, butanol according to present invention. Still more preferably, said organic solvent is cyclohexanone.<br>
In an embodiment, the organic solvent having a dielectric constant of about 12 to about 50 comprises from about 4% to about 50% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 16 % to about 50 % by total weight of the composition according to the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, said another organic solvent having a dielectric constant from about 1 to about 4 may be selected from toluene, xylene, solvesso-200, C-9, solvesso-100, solvesso-150 and the like.<br>

The emulsifying agent is preferably used in an amount of about 0.1 to about 40.0 %, and preferably from about 1.0 to about 30.0 % by total weight of the compositions according to the present invention. In another preferred embodiment, the emulsifying agent is present in an amount of about 2.0 to about 20.0 % by total weight of the compositions.<br>
In an embodiment, the compositions according to present invention additionally comprises stabilizer.<br>
The stabilizer may be preferably selected from butanol, propanol, propargyl alcohol, acetic anhydride, acetic acid, epichlorohydrin and epoxidised soybean oil and like. The stabilizer is preferably used in an amount of about 0.25% to about 10%.<br>
The storage stability of the present emulsion concentrate is dependent, inter alia, on the pH of the final formulation.<br>
In an embodiment, the emulsifiable concentrate of the present invention affords excellent storage stability in a pH range of from about 4.0 to about 6.0.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, the non phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate according to the present invention are prepared by a process comprising: (a) admixing at least a first organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from about 12 to about 50 and at least a second organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from about 1 to about 4 in a mixing vessel; (b) adding an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium to the first homogenous mixture of step (a) at an ambient temperature to obtain second homogenous mixture; and (c) adding at least one emulsifying agent in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 40% and additionally adding a stabilizer in an amount of from about 0.25 to about 10% by weight of the composition to the<br><br>
second homogenous mixture of step (b) with stirring to obtain a homogenous mixture.<br>
In an embodiment, said process for the preparation of a non-phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate additionally comprises filtering the resultant mixture obtained in step (c) of the previous aspect of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment, the non-phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising acifluorfen sodium further comprises a second herbicide selected from class of  aryloxyphenoxypropionates, called as "fops".<br>
Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides a non- phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium and a second herbicide selected from the class of aryloxyphenoxypropionates known as "fops" herbicide.<br>
According to present invention, the "fops" herbicide comprises a herbicide selected from the group comprising clodinafop-propargyl, cyhalofop-butyl, diclofop-methyl, fluazifop-butyl, fluazifop-P-butyl, haloxyfop, propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-P.<br>
In an embodiment, "fops" herbicide comprises from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 1.0% to about 40% by total weight of the compositions according to the present invention. More preferably, said second herbicide comprises about 8% by total weight of the composition according to the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment, the non-phytotoxic herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate comprising an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium and a second herbicide is prepared by the procedure described hereinabove.<br><br>
The present inventors have also unexpectedly and surprisingly found that selective combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl is synergistic and has broad spectrum of activity. A person skilled in the art would not expect that selecting acifluorfen sodium from known diphenyl ether herbicides, known as "fen" herbicides and Clodinafop propargyl from aryloxyphenoxypropionates, known as "fop" herbicides and combining the same would provide synergistic herbicidal activity.<br>
There is a constant need in the art for herbicidal compositions that are synergistic. Herbicide combinations offer advantages of improved weed control, a greater spectrum of weeds controlled, reduced cost and reduced residue problems. However, the underlying mechanism by which a combination of herbicides results in synergistic action is unknown to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, the present inventors set about providing a herbicidal composition that is synergistic.<br>
Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention provides a synergistic herbicidal composition comprising an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium; and an agrochemically effective amount of clodinafop propargyl.<br>
In an embodiment, clodinafop propargyl comprises from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 1.0% to about 40%, more preferably 2-10% by total weight of the compositions according to the present invention. Most preferably, clodinafop propargyl comprises about 8% by total weight of the composition according to the present invention.<br>
According to present invention, the synergistic herbicidal compositions can be either solid or liquid formulations or solutions. For example, the herbicidal compositions of the present invention can be formulated as soluble liquid, water<br><br>
based emulsions, suspension concentrates, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dusts, water dispersible granules, aerosols, or flowable emulsion concentrates. In such formulations, the compounds are extended with a liquid or solid carrier and, when desired, suitable surfactants are incorporated. In a most embodiment of this aspect of the invention described hereinafter, the synergistic compositions according to the present invention may be formulated as emulsifiable concentrates.<br>
The synergistic herbicidal compositions of the present invention may include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices and the formulation type. The selection of the adjuvants according to the desired formulation type is within expertise of the person skilled in the art and is not particularly limiting.<br>
The synergistic herbicidal compositions of the present invention can be prepared according the conventional procedure used for formulating desired formulation type and is within the expertise of the person skilled in the art.<br>
In other embodiments, the formulations comprising the synergistic combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl may be formulated using the ingredients and the process for the preparation of non phytotoxic emulsifiable concentrate comprising acifluorfen sodium.<br>
In an embodiment, the compositions according to the present invention optionally comprise a safener. Preferably, the safener is cloquintocet-mexyl that accelerates the rate of clodinafop-propargyl break down in crops, thus preventing the accumulation of a lethal dose.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the safener is present in an amount of about 0.1% to about 30% by weight of the second active ingredient component,<br><br>
preferably 1% to about 15% by weight of clodinafop acid or an agrochemically acceptable salt or an ester thereof.<br>
The present inventors have further found that soluble liquid or water based formulation comprising clodinafop propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium had poor stability. The inventors conducted experiments on the soluble liquid formulations comprising these two active ingredients and observed that a soluble liquid composition comprising acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and clodinafop propargyl was highly unstable and quickly degraded rendering the composition incapable of being used.<br>
In order to solve the problem of water mediated degradation of clodinafop propargyl, it was essential to co-formulate clodinafop propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium wherein the use of aqueous phase is completely eliminated thereby solving the instability problem of clodinafop propargyl. An emulsifiable concentrate is the example of such formulation type. However, there is a great difficulty of preparing an emulsifiable concentrate when active ingredient is a water-soluble herbicide such as acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium. It was known that emulsifiable concentrates of water soluble active ingredients such as acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium were difficult to formulate because of their low solubility in conventional non polar medium used for making emulsifiable concentrates. It is known in the art that emulsifiable concentrates are suitable for limited number of active ingredients only. Many active ingredients are not soluble enough to be supplied economically in this form.<br>
A person skilled in the art would expect a water soluble herbicide salt to dissolve in water and only partly soluble in an organic solvent. It was unexpectedly and surprisingly found that it is indeed possible to form an emulsifiable concentrate formulation comprising a water-soluble herbicide using a combination of organic solvents having predetermined dielectric constants. The<br><br>
present inventors have surprisingly found that the dielectric constant of organic solvents play a major role in imparting storage stability, emulsifiability and solubility profile to the emulsifiable concentrate of acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and clodinafop propargyl.<br>
It was unexpectedly found that organic solvents having dielectric constants in pre-determined ranges when used in combination in a specific weight ratio played a major role in providing desired emulsifiable concentrate. The present inventors have formulated the emulsifiable concentrate including clodinafop propargyl and acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium based on these surprising findings that provides excellent storage stability, emulsifiablity and solubility profile to the final formulation.<br>
The present inventors have also found that aqueous formulation, wettable powder, water dispersible granules and the tank mixtures of acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl cause phytotoxicity to the desired crops.<br>
It was surprisingly found by the present inventors that emulsifiable concentrate formulation of acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium with clodinafop propargyl solved the problem of phytotoxicity to the desired crops. Thus, the present inventors set about providing a composition that is storage stable and non- phytotoxic.<br>
Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention provides a storage stable agrochemical emulsifiable concentrate comprising;<br>
(i)       an   agrochemically   effective   amount   of acifluorfen   sodium   or<br>
fomesafen sodium; (ii)      an agrochemically effective amount of clodinafop propargyl; (iii)     at least a first organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from<br>
about 12 to about 50; and<br><br>
(iv)      at least a second organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from about 1 to about 4, wherein the ratio of the said organic solvents is in the range from about 4: 1 to about 0.04: 1 by weight.<br>
When the preferred water soluble herbicide is fomesafen sodium, it is present in an amount of from about 4 % to about 8 % and preferably about 8.4 % of the total weight of the compositions according to the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the amount of clodinafop propargyl, the selection of preferred organic solvents and their respective percentages to achieve desirable properties of the end-formulation, the selection and amount of preferred emulsifying agents, the choice of suitable stabilizers, the preferred pH range, the selection of preferred safeners etc. are as per the preceding aspects and embodiments of the present invention, which are reproduced herein in its entirety.<br>
In an embodiment, the emulsifiable concentrate according to present invention provides best stability, emulsifiability and solubility when εmix is from about 4 to about 35 and preferably when  is from about 4 to about 23. However, it should be understood that εmix of the selected ratio of solvents is not particularly limiting as long as the desired ratio of the solvents is maintained.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the emulsifiable concentrate formulations according to the present invention are prepared by a process comprising (a) admixing at least a first organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from about 12 to about 50 and at least a second organic solvent having a dielectric constant of from about 1 to about 4 in a mixing vessel; (b) adding an agrochemically effective amount of acifluorfen sodium or fomesafen sodium and an agrochemically effective amount of clodinafop propargyl to the first homogenous mixture of step (a) at an ambient temperature to obtain second homogenous mixture; (c) adding at<br><br>
least one emulsifying agent in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 40% and at least one stabilizer in an amount of from about 0.25% to about 10% by weight of the composition to the second homogenous mixture of step (b) with stirring to obtain a homogenous mixture and; d) filtering the resultant mixture.<br>
The formulations as described above have selective herbicidal action for crop plants and weeds. Such a selective herbicidal action renders the composition useful to control the following weeds.<br>
Monocotyledon weeds or grassy weeds of the genera such as wild oats (Avena), crabgrass (Digitaria), barnyardgrass (Echinochloa), goosegrass (Eluesin), millet grass (Panicum), foxtail (Setaria.), bermudagrass (Cynodon), Blue grass (Poa), sorghum (sorghum),bulrush (Scripus), quackgrass (Agropyron) and arrow grass (sagittaria)<br>

The formulations of the present invention have a selective herbicidal action and may be used for post emergence weed control in various crops viz. Soybean, Green gram, Black gram, Groundnut, wheat and pea. Further, this composition may also be used as inter row directed application as post emergence weed control and pre planting application in case of zero tillage cultivation before planting of crop in some susceptible crops such as cotton, potato, tomato, chilli, sugarcane, onion, cucurbits, cabbage, cauliflower, beets (especially sugarbeets),<br><br>
sunflowers, rapeseeds and for achieving an effective weed control in perennial crops (grape vines and orchards),<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be used as post emergence application to control wide range of weeds from weeds stage of 1-2 leaf stage to 4 to 6 tilling/ branching stage, preferably 2 to 4 leaf stage or 7 to 60 days after sowing of crop, preferably 15 to 25 days after sowing of crop.<br>

Conclusion:<br>
The results of the above table show that the combination of organic solvent 1 having a dielectric constant of from about 12 to 50 and organic solvent 2 having a dielectric constant of from about 1 to 4 provide excellent storage stability, solubility and emulsifiability in a ratio of 0.04: 1 to 4: 1. It is clearly evident from the table that storage stability, solubility and emulsifiability of the emulsifiable concentrate are not simultaneously achievable when the organic solvent 1 and organic solvent 2 are not present within the predetermined ratio.

Results<br>
In the field trials, phytotoxicity of Acifluorfen sodium WP, Acifluorfen sodium WDG and Acifluorfen sodium (Blazer) SL on black gram were compared with formulations of present invention (EC formulation of acifluorfen sodium). The results of the field trial showed that Acifluorfen sodium SL (Blazer), Acifluorfen sodium WP, and Acifluorfen sodium WDG resulted into crop phytotoxicity, i.e. leaf scorching while Acifluorfen sodium EC formulations were safe and there was no phytotoxicity on crop.<br>
Bio-efficacy Evaluation of synergistic composition of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl.<br>
Field trials were conducted using the combination of acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop- propargyl according to the present invention. The emulsifiable concentrate of acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl was used for the purpose of field trials. However, the other formulations types for e.g. soluble liquid, water based emulsions, suspension concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, water dispersible granules, aerosols, or flowable emulsion concentrates and the like are within the scope of the present invention and the below studies exemplified with a emulsifiable concentrate formulation are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
This experiment shows the significantly superior bioefficacy of the combination of Acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl against grasses and broad leaf weeds as post emergent selective herbicides in soybean and black gram.<br>
Combination of two active ingredients was prepared by mixing sodium acifluorfen with clodinafop propargyl, which are individually known for broad leaf weeds killer and grassy weeds killer, respectively, in an amount to obtain about a 16.5% (w/v) sodium acifluorfen and 8% (w/v) clodinafop propargyl, respectively in an emulsifiable concentrated (EC) formulation.<br><br>
The bioefficacy was observed by counting the weed density from test field treated with test herbicidal compounds, acifluorfen sodium (EC) and Clodinafop propargyl (EC) individually and ready mix combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl formulated in emulsifiable concentrate. The crops considered was soybeans (Glycine max) and black gram (Phaseolus mungo Roxb) for test.<br>
Experimental Methods:<br>
Seeds of soybeans (Glycine max) and black gram (Phaseolus mungo Roxb) were planted in field to conduct a filed trial to assess the bioefficacy of Acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl alone and combination of Acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl. The trial was laid out in Randomized Black Design (RBD) with thirteen treatments including untreated control, replicated three times. For each treatments plot size of 35 sq.m was maintained. To raise the crops all the agronomical practices were followed as usually adopted. The test herbicidal compounds, Acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl alone and combination of Acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl formulated in emulsifiable concentrate formulation with prescribed dose, were applied using hand operated knapsack sprayer fitted plat fan nozzle. The spray volume was used at 500 1/ha for application of all herbicidal compounds. Untreated control plot was also sprayed by 500 1/ha water without adding any herbicides. Observations on bioefficacy was taken by taking dry weight of weeds, grassy and broad leaf weeds separately, at 30 days after treatment and per cent weed control was calculated by using following formula (Anderson 1963):<br>
Weed dry weight in treatment<br>
Per cent weed control = (1-    	)   x 100<br>
Weed dry weight in untreated<br><br>
Synergism of combination was calculated by Colby's   formula<br>
E= X + Y- ((X * Y)/100)<br>
Whereas<br>
E= Expected % control by mixture of two products A and B in a defined dose.<br>
X= Observed % control by product A<br>

* Mean of three replications,; GW= Grassy weeds, BLW=Broad lead weeds Conclusion:<br>
The above table clearly shows that there is a significant difference in the percentage weed control of (i) acifluorfen sodium alone and clodinafop propargyl alone; and (ii) combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl. Acifluorfen sodium alone, found effective against broad leaf weeds and to some extent grassy weeds also, whereas clodinafop propargyl alone, found effective against grassy weeds only. However, when acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl are combined, it is observed that combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl exhibit and show greater efficiency and efficacy in controlling grassy as well as broad leaf weeds as compared to individual application. Such result is not achieved with the individual application of two actives.<br>
It is evident from the results of the above table particularly from Sr. No 9 to 12 that there is a marked increase in the percentage of weed control, against grassy as well as broad leaves weeds when acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl are used in combination. The results conclude that there is a significant difference in the expected and actual weed control with the combination of acifluorfen sodium and clodinafop propargyl, thus indicative of synergistic activity as per Colby's formula.<br>

Comparison of Phytotoxicity:<br>
The crops considered for phytotoxicity evaluation was Soybean (Glycine max) and Black gram (Phaseolus mungo) Roxb) for test.<br>
Experimental Methods:<br>
Tank mixture of acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl and ready mix of the acifluorfen sodium and Clodinafop propargyl in different formulation types was prepared as Example 1, Example 2, Example 3 and Example 4 and phytotoxicity on test were compared through field trials. The trial was laid out in Randomized Black Design (RBD) with nine treatments including untreated control, replicated three times for each example. For each treatments plot size of 24.5 sq.m was maintained. To raise the crops, all the agronomical practice was followed as usually adopted for soybean and black gram cultivation. The test herbicidal compounds, with prescribed doses were applied using hand operated knapsack sprayer fitted plat fan nozzle. The spray volume was used at 500 /1ha for application of all treatments. Untreated control plot was also sprayed by 500 1 /ha water without adding any herbicides. Observation on phytotoxicity (leaf scorching) was recorded at 3, 7 and 21 days after application of treatments from ten plants which were randomly selected from each plot.<br>
