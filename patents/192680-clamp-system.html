The invention relates to a clamp system for connecting an outer component, in particular a hub, having a cylindrical opening to an inner component, in particular a shaft, having a cylindrical external surface and arranged concentrically within the opening.<br>
A first such clamp system is known from the DE 23 29 940 A 1. Here the individual cone rings each have a conical surface and a cylindrical circumferential surface which lies directly against the opposite circumferential surface of the hub or shaft. With another type also of this kind according to DE 24 58 229 A 1 the cone rings have two conical circumferential surfaces and each has a further cone ring which has a conical and a cylindrical circumferential surface. Here the cone rings co-operating with the clamp screws exert their radical force by way of the further cone rings onto the adjoining cylindrical circumferential surface of the shaft or hub.<br>
The two types have in common that the cone rings and the circumferential web of the double cone ring are provided with the bores for the clamp screws and the push-off screws on a common pitch circle and within the same spacing. Therefore, in some places of the circumference, in the positions where normally clamp screws are located, bores are provided for push-off screws. This construction<br><br>
4<br>
considerably simplifies the manufacture on a boring mill with a suitable indexing attachment.<br>
However, the uniform spacing, which has manufacturing advantages, also causes problems with regard to ensuring the correct mounting of the front cone ring facing the heads of the clamp screws, either at the factory or on site, e.g. during the fastening of belt drive pulleys for conveyor belts in open cast mines or the like. As a matter of fact, from the front it cannot readily be noted whether the cone ring is in the correct angular position in relation to the double cone ring, in which the various types of bores just cover one another. In the event of a careless installation it sometimes happens that the threaded bores in the front cone ring facing the heads of the clamp screws, which serve to loosen this cone ring from the double cone ring, lie exactly opposite the threaded bores in the circumferential web of the double cone ring which are provided for loosening the cone ring facing away from the heads of the clamp screws. As the numbers of push-off screws for loosening the front and the rear cone ring are the same and the push-off screws are evenly divided over the circumference, it may happen that all threaded bores in the front cone ring facing the heads of the clamp screws lie opposite the threaded bores in the circumferential web. From the clamp screws nothing can be noted about this situation.<br>
When the push-off screws are then screwed into the threaded bores of the front cone ring and encoimter the threaded bores in the circumferential web, on the one hand the pushing-off of the front cone ring becomes difficult due to the absence of a proper abutment, and moreover the threaded bores in the circiunferential web are destroyed to such an extent that a pushing-off of the rear cone ring may no longer be possible and the entire cone clamping set can no longer be loosened.<br>
When this happens, the damage is considerable. This situation may occur only after years when the loosening of the clamping set is already no longer easy due to corrosion and dirt.<br><br>
It is the object of the invention to avoid an incorrect angular position during the mounting of the cone rings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a clamp system for connecting an outer component, m particular a hub, having a cylmdrical opening to an inner component, in particular a shaft, having a cylindrical external surface and arranged concentrically within the opening, the said clamp system comprising a biconical ring having a cylindrical surface and two mutually oppositely directed conical surfaces having a conicity lying in the self-locking range, the greatest wall thickness of the biconical ring lying middle of the biconical ring looking axially; two further conical rings, which each have a conical surface which co-operates with a conical surface of the biconical ring; axial clamping screws in the form of headed screws having a regular distribution around a pitch circle: axial thrust or pushing-off screws which are provided at the same spacing in the positions of clamping screws at their positions and by means of which the conical rings can be pushed axially away from the biconical ring; and a radialh projecting circumferential web provided on the biconical ring between the conical rings in the region of the clamping screws, the web having in it axial clearance bores for the clamping screws at the points which line up with the clearance bores in the conical ring nearest the heads of the screws and screw-threaded bores in the conical ring furthest from the heads of the screws, while at other points distributed circumferentially in the circumferential web there are bore-free points which lie opposite scerew-threaded bores for thrust or pushing-off screws in the conical ring nearest the heads of the screws, and at still further points distributed circumferentially in the circumferential web there are provided screw-threaded bores which line up with clearance bores in the conical ring nearest the heads of the screws and with bore-free points in the conical ring furthest from the heads of the screws, characterized in that at one point a clamping screw is present offset from the uniform spacing.<br><br>
The simple measure of shifting one clamp screw bore in the circumferential direction so that it falls out of the spacing ensures that there is only one angular position of the front cone ring in relation to the double cone ring in which all clamp screws can be screwed in during the mounting. If one screw cannot be screwed in, this is a sign that the angular position is not correct. If a clamp screw in a position that lies within the spacing should by chance encounter the through-bore in the circumferential web that lies outside the spacing, all other screws will not fit. This ensures a compulsory check of the correct position of the front cone ring in relation to the circumferential web by means of a conspicuous index.<br>
An exemplified embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing.<br>
Fig. i shows a side view of a cone clamping arrangement, wherein the clamping<br>
set is indicated in a longitudinal section along the line I-I in Fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a partial view according to Fig. 1 from the left;<br>
Fig. 3 to 5 show partial cross-sections through the clamping set along the lines<br>
Ill-in and IV-IV in Fig. 2 and a corresponding partial cross-section in the event of<br>
an incorrect mounting.<br>
The clamping set, which in Fig. 1 has as a whole been given the reference numeral 10, serves to connect a shaft 1 with an axle A to an external component 2 in the form of a gear-wheel, a driving pulley, a belt driving pulley or generally a hub. The cylindrical outer circumference 3 of the shaft 1 has a smaller diameter<br><br>
than the cylindrical inside circumference 4 of the external component 2. The clamping set 10 is arranged in the clearance.<br>
With the exemplified embodiment the clamping set 10 comprises a double cone ring 20 with a cyhndrical outer circumferential surface 21 and two inside conical circumferential surfaces 22, 23 which are inclined in opposite directions in such a way that the greatest wall thickness, seen axially, Hes in the middle of the double cone ring 20. In the middle, i.e. between the conical surfaces 22, 23, the double cone ring 20 has a radially inwards projecting circumferential web 24, which with its cylindrical inside circumferential surface 25 hes against the outside circum¬ferential surface 3 of the shaft 1, so that the circumferential web 24 can ensure centring duties.<br>
The double cone ring 20 is associated with two individual cone rings 30 and 40, which in the exemplified embodiment each have a cyhndrical inside circum¬ferential surface 31 and 41, respectively, and a conical outside circimiferential surface 32 and 42, respectively, which co-operate with the conical inside circumferential surfaces 22 and 23. The conical surfaces 22, 42 and 23, 32 have cone angles that lie in the self-locking range and rest against one another whilst the inside faces 33, 43 of the cone rings 30, 40 are still positioned at an axial distance firom the circimiferential web 24.<br>
The clamping of the clamping set 10 takes place by means of clamp screws 5 with heads 6, evenly distributed over the drcranference, which according to Fig. 1 pass from the left through through-bores 36 in the cone ring 30 and through-bores 26 in the circumferential web 24 and engage into threaded bores 46 in the cone ring 40 positioned away from the heads 6.<br>
The circumferential web 24 projects radially inwards from the conical surfaces 22, 23, in the area of which the double cone ring 20 is quite thin-walled. With the exemplified embodiment the radial span of the circumferential web 24 amounts to<br><br>
about three times the greatest wall thickness in the area of the conical surfaces 22, 23. The area of the radial projection of the circumferential web 24 is taken up by the cone rings 30, 40, and also the clamp screws 5 extend in this area. The cone rings 30, 40, therefore, are radially relatively thick-walled, so that the bores for the clamp screws 5 and in particular their heads 6 can be accommodated in their radial span. Because they are thick-walled, the cone rings 30, 40 are quite stable and without special measures require a quite high clamping force of the screws 5 just for their deformation, which does not contribute to the clamping force. To reduce the deformation resistance and to ensure that as much as possible of die clamping force contributes to the clamping action, with the exemplified embodiment the cone ring is provided with a continuous groove 9 in a plane that passes through the axle.<br>
When tightening the clamp screws 5 the cone rings 30, 40 are pulled axially against one another, slide along the conical surfaces 22,42 and 23, 32 respective¬ly, and radially widen the double cone ring 20, resulting in a clamping of the external component 2 on the shaft 1.<br>
As the conical surfaces 22, 42 and 23, 32, respectively, lie in the self-locking range, a conversion of the axial clamping force of the clamp screws 5 into a radial clamping force takes place with a relatively high degree of efficiency. The self-locking on the other hand ensures that once the clamping set 10 has been tightened, it cannot again come loose by itself, but requires special measures which will be explained with reference to Fig. 2 to 5.<br>
All clamp screws he on a common pitch circle 7 in a uniform spacing which in Fig. 2 is indicated by the angle 8 between bores that succeed one another in the circumferential direction. In some places, e.g. three evenly distributed places, at the pitch positions in question no clamp screws 5, but prepared shapings for push-off screws are provided.<br><br>
9<br>
Such a shaping is illustrated in Fig. 3. At this place the cone ring 30 has a through-bore 36, the circumferential web 24 a threaded bore 27 and the cone ring 40 a bore-free place 44. According to Fig. 3 it is possible to screw in a screw, e.g. a turned-out clamp screw 5, in this place and to push the cone ring 40 off the double cone ring 20 to the right.<br>
Another pushing-off arrangement, which is provided in a different circumferential place, is shown in Fig. 4. Here the cone ring 30 has a threaded bore 37 and the circiunferential web 24 a bore-free place 28. How the other cone ring 40 is shaped at this place is immaterial. By screwing a screw 5 into the threaded bore 37, the cone ring 30 is pushed off the double cone ring 20, according to Fig. 4 to the left.<br>
In this way the two cone rings 30, 40 can be securely detached from the double cone ring 20 independently from one another.<br>
When mounting the clamping set 10 it is difficult to see from the front which shaping of the circumferential web 24 lies behind the respective bore of the cone ring 30. In unfavourable cases it may happen that the cone ring 30 is joined to the double cone ring 20 in such an angular position that the situation according to Fig. 5 occurs, i.e. the threaded bores 37 and 27 cover one another. In that case the clamp screws 5 can easily be screwed in and tightened. The tightening can, therefore, take place without noticing that the cone ring 30 is positioned incorrectly in relation to the double cone ring 20. When in that case after some time, to ensure a loosening, a screw 5 is screwed from the front into the threaded bore 37, it will encounter the threaded bore 27, can only support itself on the edge of same, and with the great forces that are required will partly work itself into the thread of the threaded bore 27. Even if it should still be possible to pull the cone ring 30 off the double cone ring 20 to the left, the thread of the threaded bore 27 will, however, be mined, so that it is no longer possible to screw a screw into the threaded bore 27 to loosen the cone ring 40.<br><br>
To prevent this situation, at one place a clamp screw 5" with the associated bores is shifted by a small angle 15 in the circumferential direction out of the normal spacing in which this clamp screw would have taken up the position 5' indicated by broken lines in Fig. 2. In that case there is only one position of the cone ring 30 in the circumferential direction in relation to the double cone ring 20 in which all clamp screws 5 can be screwed in. This position is, of course, chosen in such a way that the pushing-off shapings according to Fig. 3 and 4 are present, and not those according to Fig. 5. The case shown in Fig. 5 cannot occur then. If one clamp screw 5 or all clamp screws 5 except one cannot be turned in, this is an obvious indication that the angular position of the cone ring 30 is not correct. With the exemplified embodiment the shifted clamp screw 5" lies next to the groove 9. In this way the place located outside the spacing can easily be found.<br><br><br>
