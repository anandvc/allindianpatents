NON-REFILLABLE STOPPER FOR BOTTLES OF SPIRITS AND THE<br>
LIKE<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is intended to disclose a non-<br>
refillable stopper for bottles of spirits and the like<br>
which provide appreciable characteristics of novelty and<br>
inventive step.<br>
In non-refillable type stoppers for bottles of<br>
spirits and the like it is claimed that the stopper not<br>
only offers characteristics which prevent its direct<br>
filling after the customary screw cap of the bottle has<br>
been opened, but has characteristics which make it<br>
difficult to dismantle the stopper from the bottle in<br>
order to refill the same with beverages of lower quality.<br>
Many systems are known by means of which the<br>
manufacturers of the non-refillable stoppers have<br>
attempted to obtain ever higher degrees of security, in<br>
order to prevent the disassembly of the stopper from the<br>
bottle after having exhausted the original contents<br>
thereof, refilling the same with other beverages. In<br>
many cases the safety measures against said disassembly<br>
are provided on the basis of means which prevent<br>
extraction by providing different radial retaining steps<br>
and making the materials more or less rigid. However,<br>
one drawback which arises with the non-refillable<br>
stoppers produced in this way is that of the mechanical<br>
complication of the manufacturing moulds and therefore,<br>
of the relatively high cost which it may involve, since<br>
the arrangement of stepped regions, radial or otherwise,<br>
inside elements of the non-refillable stopper represents<br><br>
2<br>
a significant complication in the manufacturing moulds,<br>
which must necessarily have available a plurality of<br>
radially movable elements, which complicates their<br>
manufacture and use a great deal.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to obtain a non-<br>
refillable stopper of the type generally known,<br>
constituted by an outer casing or tube cap, associated<br>
with the screw cap at the body, which is retained in the<br>
neck of the bottle and is complemented by a part termed a<br>
washer which is that part which is centred in the inner<br>
part of the opening of the neck of the bottle, and which<br>
on the outside is in many cases associated by means of<br>
protuberances and recesses with the body of the stopper,<br>
which is the source of complications and an increase in<br>
cost. The washer receives on the inside the valve which<br>
is of the one-way type, that is to say, it permits the<br>
outflow of the liquid as soon as the stopper has been<br>
removed by unscrewing, and does not permit the<br>
introduction of a fresh liquid, since it is arranged on a<br>
suitable seat of the washer, preventing the entry of<br>
liquid into the bottle.<br>
The present invention is based on the constitution<br>
of a body for the stopper which is coupled to a<br>
reinforced zone of the washer simply by conical seating,<br>
that is to say, without the need for special sockets<br>
which significantly complicate the manufacture of the<br>
moulds and that of the actual parts. The body is<br>
retained below by means of the customary step in the neck<br>
of the bottle.<br>
The tube cap is retained in an anti-rotational<br>
function with respect to the body by providing a<br>
plurality of groups of small incisive protuberances on<br><br>
3<br>
vertical connecting bridges of the lower rim of said<br>
body, so that when the tube cap is mounted on the body,<br>
said protuberances are inserted, preventing the rotation<br>
of one element with respect to the other. The lower edge<br>
of the body is simply straight without any need for<br>
retention with the outer tube cap.<br>
In a variant intended to obtain easy automated<br>
fitting of the stopper before the bottle filling and<br>
sealing line, and strong characteristics of resistance to<br>
any manipulation of the stopper, the essential<br>
improvement has been introduced of constituting the lower<br>
part of the body of the stopper as a plurality of<br>
independent sectors by means of separating cuts or<br>
interruptions of continuity that are substantially<br>
longitudinal, giving rise to a series of independent<br>
wings, each of which adapts, by separation from the rest,<br>
to the lower edge of the neck. The number of sections<br>
may vary, as may their specific dimensional<br>
characteristics. Likewise, although for the sake of<br>
simplicity it has been observed that the longitudinal<br>
cuts or separations are the most practical from the point<br>
of view of manufacture, neither is it excluded for said<br>
lateral separations between the different zones to be in<br>
the form of oblique or curved cuts or cuts of other type.<br>
For greater understanding thereof, drawings<br>
corresponding to a non-refillable stopper produced<br>
according to the present invention are appended by way of<br>
non-limiting example.<br>
Figure 1 shows a partial longitudinal section<br>
through a non-refillable stopper which incorporates the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
4<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are respective details of the zone<br>
of coupling of the rim of the body with the neck of the<br>
bottle with and without windows, respectively.<br>
Figure 4 shows a view in side elevation of the body<br>
of the non-refillable stopper.<br>
Figure 5 shows a plan view of the actual body of<br>
Figure 4.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show respective sections on the<br>
section planes represented in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 8 shows a view from below of the actual body<br>
of the stopper.<br>
Figure 9 shows a complete section of a non-<br>
refillable stopper body according to a variant.<br>
Figure 10 shows a view in side elevation of the<br>
actual body of the non-refillable stopper of Figure 8.<br>
Figure 11 shows a view from below of the body of the<br>
non-refillable stopper of Figures 9 and 10.<br>
Figure 12 is a perspective view of the same variant.<br>
As shown in the drawings, the non-refillable stopper<br>
of the present invention is intended for the non-<br>
refillable closure of a bottle, the neck 1 of which has a<br>
conventional structure, being covered externally by the<br>
tube cap 2 which in turn receives on top the overcap 3,<br>
the unscrewing of which will free the upper, open part of<br>
the body 4 equipped with the upper opening for the<br>
outflow of the liquid contained in the bottle. An<br>
intermediate valve 5 sits on the rim 6 of the inner part<br>
of the washer 7, which is coupled to the inner surface 8<br>
of the neck 1 of the bottle and sits on the upper face of<br>
said neck. Below the valve 5 the washer 7 has an<br>
opening, defined, for example, by means of crossed radial<br>
bridges 9.<br><br>
5<br>
According to the present invention, the washer 7 has<br>
a reinforced structure 10, especially in the part of the<br>
base, the outer wall 11 of which is conical and is<br>
intended to receive the inner wall 12, likewise conical,<br>
of the opposite part of the body, achieving by its axial<br>
introduction a simple assembly and highly resistant<br>
wedging. The body 4 has below, as is customary, a<br>
series of steps 13 for retention with the lower edge 14<br>
of the outer rim of the neck of the bottle, also having<br>
in the present invention an outer rim directed towards<br>
the outside 14' and intended to receive the compression<br>
action towards the inside of the tube cap 2, which<br>
increases the pressure contact of the protruding edges 13<br>
against the step 14 of the neck of the bottle. In this<br>
way, there is a very appreciable increase in the force<br>
required to extract the stopper assembly, which is<br>
therefore much more secure against manipulation for<br>
refilling the bottle.<br>
As can be seen in the drawings, the body 4 has the<br>
external screw thread 15 and a plurality of vertical<br>
bridges 16, 16', 16", equipped with a plurality of<br>
protuberances of small dimensions, distributed in zones,<br>
which have a pointed shape in an upward direction, being<br>
designated in the drawing by the numerals 17, 17', 17".<br>
The body 4 has at the side the customary flexibilising<br>
windows such as 19, 19' and others of smaller dimensions<br>
20, 20'.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show respectively a view with the<br>
windows 18 and with the corresponding solid part. The<br>
arrangement of the conical parts 10 and 11 for retention<br>
by wedging can be seen in both.<br><br>
6<br>
In the lower part of the tube cap 2, in the zone<br>
indicated by the numeral 21, a series of grooves have<br>
been arranged in the tube cap which engage with<br>
respective ribs of the neck of the bottle that are<br>
located in the corresponding opposite zone.<br>
By means of the construction shown, when the tube<br>
cap is assembled axially with the body 4 by pressure, the<br>
groups of protuberances 17, 17', 17" will bite into the<br>
material of the tube cap, obtaining an anti-rotatory<br>
effect.<br>
In the variant of Figures 9 to 12, the body of the<br>
non-refillable stopper, which has been indicated overall<br>
by the numeral 25, is equipped below with several wings<br>
separated from one another, smoothly inclined towards the<br>
outside, and which have been indicated by the numerals<br>
26, 27, 28 and 29 and are separated from one another by<br>
interruptions of continuity or cuts 30, 31, 32 and 33<br>
that are longitudinal. The number of sections 26, 27, 28<br>
and 2 9 may vary, four of which having been shown in the<br>
appended drawings by way of example. Likewise, the zones<br>
of separation of the different sections mentioned may be<br>
straight, substantially in planes substantially parallel<br>
to the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the body of the<br>
stopper, but could be of some other different shape, such<br>
as slightly inclined, curved, etc. In all cases, what<br>
has been demonstrated to be essential for the purposes of<br>
the invention is the constitution of a plurality of lower<br>
wings 26, 27, 28 and 29 separated laterally from one<br>
another, so that each one can fit correctly by means of<br>
its lower inner edge on the lower edge of the neck of the<br>
bottle. In the present embodiment, the individual steps<br>
for the wing 28 can be seen, for example 34 and 35, which<br><br>
7<br>
are located below the wide corresponding openings such as<br>
those indicated by the numerals 36 and 37.<br>
With the mentioned structure, the Applicant has<br>
demonstrated that the ease of assembly of the body of the<br>
stopper in the operation of automated fitting of the<br>
stopper assembly is very much simplified, obtaining a<br>
notable saving in time and, on the other hand, the<br>
construction of the wings separated from one another in<br>
the lower part of the body of the stopper permits<br>
improved adaptation of the inner ribs of the body of the<br>
stopper in the neck of the bottle, giving rise to more<br>
even and securer clamping over the whole of the common<br>
contour between the body of the non-refillable stopper<br>
and the lower rim of the neck of the bottle.<br>
As may be observed, by means of the production of<br>
non-refillable stoppers according to the present<br>
invention, simple manufacture of the moulds for the<br>
washer and the body is obtained, and also simple fitting<br>
of the stopper and an increased non-refilling efficacy.<br>
Greater ease of fitting of the stopper is also obtained<br>
and a greater resistance to surreptitious disassembly.<br>
In order to obtain greater strength in the elements<br>
of the stopper, technical materials known on the market<br>
and customarily used, and having greater or lesser<br>
rigidity, will be selected in order to adjust the<br>
characteristics of the parts so as to facilitate their<br>
assembly. In particular, the body of the stopper will be<br>
made of polycarbonate, although, as can be understood, it<br>
could also be manufactured of other technical plastics<br>
materials, especially of the type suitable for preventing<br>
its deformation in the presence of heat.<br><br>
8<br>
Although the invention has been described with<br>
respect to a preferred embodiment of same shown in the<br>
appended drawings, it will be understood that experts in<br>
the field, after reading the description and<br>
interpretation of the drawings, could introduce<br>
modifications of different types which by equivalence<br>
could be included within the scope of the present<br>
invention, which is defined in the attached claims.<br><br>
