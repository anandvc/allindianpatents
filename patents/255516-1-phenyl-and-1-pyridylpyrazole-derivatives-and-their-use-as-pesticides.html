l-PHENYL- AND 1-PYRIDYLPYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS PESTICIDES<br>
The invention relates to 1-(2,4,6-trisubstituted-phenyl)-5-amino-4-substitutedpyrazole<br>
derivatives, processes for their preparation, to compositions thereof, and<br>
to their use for the control of pests (including arthropods like insects and arachnids)<br>
and helminths (including nematodes).<br>
The control of insects, arachnids and helminths with 1 -arylpyrazole compounds has<br>
been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 87/03781, EP<br>
0295117, WO98/28279 and WO 98/24769.<br>
Since modern pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example<br>
regarding level, duration and spectrum of action, use spectrum, toxicity,<br>
combination with other active substances, combination with formulation auxiliaries<br>
or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistance is possible, the development<br>
of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a<br>
high demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the known<br>
compounds, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new pesticides which may be used<br>
in domestic companion animals. n<br>
It is advantageous to apply pesticides to animals in oral form so as to prevent the<br>
possible contamination of humans or the surrounding environment.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pesticides which may be used in<br>
lower dose than existing pesticides.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pesticides which are substantially<br>
non-emetic. <br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pestte^<br>
user and the environment<br>
These objects are met in whole or in part by the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a compound which is a 1-(2,4,6-trisubstitutedphenyl)-<br>
5-amino-4-ha!oalkylthiopyrazoIe derivative of formula (I):<br>

Stem Corporation, Woodrplfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, GM9 8SE, England or H+P<br>
Labprtechnik GmbH, Bruckrnannring 28, 85764 OberschleiSheim, Germany or<br>
Radleys, Shirehill,. Saffggn^WjIderjtr E^sSexr England, may be'used for the'para lief-*1<br>
procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purificatiorTdf compounds of<br>
the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be<br>
made, inter alia, of ehromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc.,<br>
4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual<br>
process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between<br>
the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully<br>
integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are<br>
operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for<br>
example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) may be<br>
prepared in part or fully by soiid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose,<br>
individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a<br>
synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin.<br>
Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the<br>
specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index",<br>
Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols<br>
which are known from the literature and which; in turn, can be performed manually<br>
or in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US<br>
4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in whTeh<br>
products by IRQRI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are<br>
employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported<br>
parallel syntheses is performed successfullyy for example, by apparatuses by<br>
Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or<br>
MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>
The preparation of the processes described herein yields compounds of the<br>
formula (I) in the form of substance collections which are termed libraries'. The<br>
present invention also provides fon to libraries which comprise 'at least two<br>
compounds of the formula (I).<br>
23<br>
Compounds of formula (II) wherein L is chlorine and Y is NR6aR7a, (C-<br>
C6)-haloalkoxy or (CrC6)-haloalkylthio, and compounds of formula (IV) wherein L1<br>
is chlorine and X is NR6aR7a, (CrCeJ-alkoxy, (C-C6)-haloalkoxy or (Cr<br>
C6)-haloalkylthio also fall within the definition of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of formula (III), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), (XI) and (XII), as well as<br>
certain compounds of formula (II) and (IV) are known or may be prepared by known<br>
methods.<br>

According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method<br>
for the control of pests at a locus which comprises applying thereto an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof. For this purpose, the said<br>
compound is normally used in the form of a pesticidal composition (i.e. in<br>
association with compatible diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents<br>
suitable for use in pesticidal compositions), for example as hereinafter described.<br>
The term "compound of the invention" as used hereinafter embraces a 1 -(2,4,6-<br>
trisubstituted-phenyl)-5-amino-4-substituted-pyrazole of formula (I) as defined<br>
above and a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof.<br>
One aspect of the present invention as defined above is a method for the control of<br>
pests at a locus. The locus includes, for example, the pest itself, the place (plant,<br>
field, forest, orchard, waterway, soil, plant product, or the like) where the pest<br>
resides or feeds, or 9 place susceptible to future infestation by the pest The<br>
compound of the invention may therefore be applied directly to the pest, to the<br>
place where the pest resides or feeds, or to the place susceptible to future<br>
infestation by the pest.<br>
As is evident from the foregoing pesticidal uses, the present invention provides<br>
pesticidally active compounds and methods of use of said compounds for the<br>
control of a number of pest species which includes: arthropods, especially insects<br>
or mites, or plant nematodes. The compound of the invention may thus be<br>
advantageously employed in practical uses, for example, in agricultural or<br>
horticultural crops, in forestry, in veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry, or in<br>
public health.<br>
The compounds of the mverjon may be used for example in the following 1 ' applications and on the following pests<br><br>
For the control of soil insects, such as corn rootworm, termites (especially for<br>
protection of structures), root maggots, wireworms, root weevils, stalkborers,<br>
cutworms, root aphids, or grubs. They may also be used to provide activity against<br>
plant pathogenic nematodes, such as root-knot, cyst, dagger, lesion, or stem or<br>
bulb nematodes, or against mites. For the control of soil pests, for example corn<br>
rootworm, the compounds are advantageously applied to or incorporated at an<br>
effective rate into the soil in which crops are planted or to be planted or to the<br>
seeds or growing plant roots.<br>
In the area of public health, the compounds are especially useful in the control of<br>
many insects, especially filth flies or other Dipteran pests, such as houseflies,<br>
stableflies, soldierflies&gt; hornflies, deerflies, horseflies, midges, punkies, blackflies,<br>
or mosquitoes.<br>
In the protection of stored products, for example cereals, including grain or flour,<br>
groundnuts, animal feedstuffs, timber or household goods, e.g. carpets and textiles,<br>
compounds of the invention are useful against attack by arthropods, more<br>
especially beetles, including weevils, moths ormites^ for example Ephestia spp.<br>
(flour moths), Anthrenus spp. (carpet beetles), Tribolium spp: (flour beetles),<br>
Sitophilus spp. (grain weevils) or Acarus spp. (mites).<br>
In the control of cockroaches, ants or termites or similar arthropod pests in infested<br>
domestic or Industrial premises or in the control of mosquito larvae in waterways,<br>
wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
For the treatment of foundations, structures or soil in the prevention of the attack on<br>
building by termites, for example, Reticulitermes spp., Heterotermesspp.,<br>
Coptoterrnesspp.. ; , v -<br>
In agriculture against adults, larvae and eggs of Lepidoptera (butterflies and<br>
moths), e.g. Heliothis spp. such as Heliothis vireseens (tobacco budworrh),<br>
Heliothis armigera and Heliothis zea. Against adults and larvae of Coleoptera<br>
(beetles) e.g. Anthonomus spp. e.g. grandis (cotton boll weevil), Leptinotarsa<br>
decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle), Diabrotica spp. (corn rootworms). Against<br>
Heter.optera (Hemiptera and Homoptera) e.g. Psylla spp:; Bernisja spp;;<br>
Trialeurodes spp., Aphis spp., Myzus spp., Megoura viciae, Phylloxera spp.,<br>
Nephotettix spp. (rice jeaf hoppers), Nilaparvata spp..<br>
Against Diptera e.g. Musca spp.. Against Thysanoptera such as Thrips tabaci.<br>
Against Orthoptera such as Locusta and Schistocerca spp., (locusts and crickets)<br>
e.g. Gryllus spp., and Acheta spp. for example, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta<br>
americana, Blatella germanica, Locusta migratoria migratorioides, and<br>
Schistocerca gregaria. Against CoIIembola e.g. Periplaneta spp. and Blatella spp.<br>
(roaches).<br>
Against arthropods of agricultural significance such as Acari (mites) e.g.<br>
Tetranychus spp., and Panonychus spp..<br>
Agairist nematodes which attack plants or trees of importance to agriculture,<br>
forestry or horticulture either directly or by spreading bacterial-viral, mycoplasma or<br>
fungal diseases of the plants. For example root-knot nematodes such as<br>
Meloidogyne spp. (e.g. M. incognita).<br>
In the field of veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry or in the maintenance of<br>
public health against arthropods which are parasitic internally or externally upon<br>
vertebrates, particularly warm-blooded vertebrates, for example domestic animals,<br>
e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, equines, swine, poultry, dogs or cats, for example<br>
Acarina, including ticks (e.g. soft-bodied ticks including Argasidae spp. e.g. Argas<br>
spp. and Ornithodorus spp. (e.g. Ornithodorus moubata); hard-bodied ticks<br>
including Ixodidae spp., e.g. Boophilus spp, e.g. Boophilus micropliis,<br>
Rhipicephalus spp. e.g. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Rhipicephalus<br>
sanguineus; mites (e.g. Damalinia spp.); fleas (e.g. Ctenocephalides spp. e.g.<br>
Ctenocephaljdes felis (cat flea) and Gtenocephalides canis (dog flea)); lice e.g. ~<br>
Menopon spp.; Diptera (e.g. Aedes spp., Anopheles spp./ Musca spp., Hypodeima<br>
spp.); Hemiptera.; Dictyoptera (e.g. Periplaneta spp., Blatella spp.); Hymenoptera;<br>
for example against infections of the gastro-intestinal tract caused by parasitic<br>
nematode worms, for example members of the family Trichostrongylidae.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (I) are used for the<br>
control of parasites of animals. Preferably the animal to be treated is a domestic<br>
companion animal such as:a dog OF.a cafc<br>
In a further aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (I) or salts or<br>
compositions thereof are used for the preparation of a veterinary medicament.<br>
A further feature of the invention thus relates to the use of a compound of formula<br>
(I) or a salt thereof, or of a composition thereof, for the control of pests.<br>
In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or<br>
helminths, especially nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises<br>
applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a<br>
compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is<br>
generally applied to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is tobe<br>
controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1kg of the active<br>
compound per hectare of locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the<br>
pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection. On the other<br>
hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may<br>
require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate<br>
depends usually upon a number of factors, for example; the type of pest being<br>
controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or<br>
also the method of application. Preferably an effective rate range of the active<br>
compound is from about 10g/ha to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about<br>
50g/ha to about 200 g/ha.<br>
When a pest is soil-borne, the active compound generally in a formulated<br>
composition* is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (ie^ for example<br>
broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is applied at rates from<br>
about 10g/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g<br>
ai/ha. When applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip irrigation to plants the liquid<br>
solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg ai/l, preferably<br>
from about 25 to about 200 mg ai/l. Application may be made, if desired, to the<br>
field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be<br>
protected from attack. The compound of the invention can be washed into the soil<br>
by spjayjng.with water over the,.area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. <br>
During, or after application, the formulated compound1 can] if desired, be distributed<br>
46<br>
mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains.<br>
Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before, sprouting<br>
has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of<br>
particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or<br>
vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals<br>
(such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field crops (such as<br>
sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as maize<br>
or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus), ornamental<br>
plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest<br>
trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries.<br>
They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted,<br>
stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites.<br>
They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits,<br>
nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from<br>
moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products<br>
such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or<br>
textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from<br>
beetle, mite or fly attack.<br>
Additionally, the compound of the invention and methods of use thereof are of<br>
particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, or<br>
spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those<br>
hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mites, lice,<br>
fleaSj midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The compounds of the invention<br>
are particularly useful jn controlling arthropods or helminths which are present<br>
inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of<br>
the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenterally,<br>
percutaneously or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or crop<br>
growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the<br>
protection^of stored products,-household goods,- property or areas of the general <br>
environment. Suitable means oftapplying the compounds of the invention include:<br>
to growing crops as foliar sprays (for example as an in-furrow spray), dusts,<br>
granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated<br>
compositions as soil or root treatments by liquid drenches, dusts, granules, smokes<br>
or foams; to seeds of crops via application as seed dressings, e.g. by liquid slurries<br>
or dusts;<br>
to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by<br>
parenteral, oral or topical application of compositions in which the active ingredient<br>
exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged action over a period of time against the<br>
arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orallyingestible<br>
pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary supplements,<br>
pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos,<br>
creams, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk,<br>
including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial<br>
premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits,<br>
or in tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful for the control of parasites of<br>
animals when applied orally, and in a further preferred aspect of the invention the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are used for the control of parasites of animals by oral<br>
application. The compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof may be administered<br>
before, during or after meals, The compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof may<br>
be mixed with a carrier and/or foodstuff./ '<br>
The compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is administered orally in a dose to<br>
the animal in a dose range generally from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg of the compound of the<br>
formula (I) or salt thereof per kilogram of animal body weight (mg/kg).<br>
The frequency of treatment of the animal, preferably the domestic animal to be<br>
treated by the compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof is generally from about<br>
once per week to about once per year, preferably from about once every two weeks<br>
to once every three months.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered most advantageously with<br>
another parasiticidalfy effective material, such as an endoparasiticide, and/or an<br>
ectoparasiticide, and/or an endectoparasiticide. For example, such compounds<br>
include macrocyclic lactones such as avermectins or milbemycins e.g., ivermectin,<br>
pyratel or an insect growth regulator such as lufenuron or methoprene.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful<br>
organisms in crops of known genetically engineered plants or genetically<br>
engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are<br>
distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to<br>
particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of<br>
plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria<br>
or viruses. Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material<br>
with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific<br>
constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is<br>
increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested material has a<br>
different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and<br>
ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats,<br>
millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed<br>
rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to<br>
insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful<br>
organisms to be observed in other crops, which are specific for application in the<br>
transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened<br>
spectrum of pests which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may<br>
be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) for<br>
controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a pesticidal<br>
composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention as defined above,<br>
in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in one or more<br>
compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents<br>
[i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted<br>
in the art as being suitable for use in pesticidal compositions and which are<br>
compatible with compounds of the invention].<br>
In practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently form parts of<br>
compositions. These compositions can be employed to control arthropods,<br>
especially insects, or plant nematodes or mites. The compositions may be of any<br>
type known in the art suitable for application to the desired pest in any premises or<br>
indoor or outdoor area. These compositions contain at least one compound of the<br>
invention as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more<br>
other compatible components which are for example, solid or liquid carriers or<br>
diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents, or the like appropriate for the intended<br>
use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable. These compositions,<br>
which may be prepared by any manner known in the art, likewise form a part of this<br>
invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in<br>
the use forms prepared from these formulations may be present in mixtures with<br>
other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides,<br>
nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>

The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary<br>
within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be eliminated<br>
or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general, the<br>
compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95%<br>
(by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to<br>
about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about<br>
50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents<br>
or the like.<br>
In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic<br>
ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to<br>
facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This<br>
carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example,<br>
agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, claysy natural or synthetic silicates, silica/<br>
resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural<br>
minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite,<br>
bentonite or djatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica,<br>
alumina, or silicates especially aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers<br>
for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such<br>
as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic<br>
or organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells,<br>
corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate,<br>
powdered cork?,or absorbent carbon black,'-water-soluble polyrriers/resins, waxes<br>
A * i 
or solid fertilizers. Such solid compositions"may, if desired, contain one or more<br>
compatible wetting, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid,<br>
may also serve as a diluent.<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water; alcohols, particularly butanol or<br>
glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglycol acetate; ketones,<br>
particularly acetone, cyclohexanone, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutylketone, or<br>
isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatic<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride;<br>
aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or<br>
strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or Nmethylpyrrolidone;<br>
liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof.<br>
The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting<br>
agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.<br>
Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids,<br>
salts of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of<br>
ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines,<br>
substituted phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of<br>
sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates),<br>
phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols,<br>
esters of fatty acids with pplyols, or sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional<br>
derivatives of the above compounds. The presence of at least one surface-active<br>
agent is generally essential when the active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are<br>
only slightly water soluble or are not water soluble and the carrier agent of the<br>
composition for application is water: •<br>
Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as<br>
adhesives or colorants. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or<br>
synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arabic gum,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol or polyvjnyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or<br>
lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. It is possible<br>
to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium<br>
oxides p^rPrussian^Blue^ organic dyestuffs, such as, alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs<br>
or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of i ron,<br>
manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural application, the compounds of the invention are therefore<br>
generally in the form of compositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms.<br>
Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content<br>
of the compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or<br>
granules (including water dispersible granules), particularly those obtained by<br>
extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting<br>
from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettable<br>
powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous<br>
or heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention,<br>
for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing<br>
or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using<br>
trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein.<br>
Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or<br>
suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions,<br>
or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also include, in particular,<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable<br>
powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of com positions<br>
which are liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example<br>
as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols.<br>
Liquid compositions,;for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble<br>
concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weig tit of the<br>
active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application<br>
contain, in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient. Besides<br>
the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required,<br>
about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active<br>
agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors; colorants or adhesives. Emulsions<br>
of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for<br>
example, to plants, may be obtained from these concentrates'by dilution with water.<br>
These compositions are included.,within the scope'of the compositions which may'-<br>
be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of waterin-<br>
oil or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency.<br>
The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use<br>
applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to<br>
infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention)<br>
including premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or<br>
equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied,<br>
for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are<br>
generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per<br>
hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon<br>
the need or application technique. The compound or compositions according to the<br>
invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves<br>
having pests to be eliminated. Another method of application of the compounds or<br>
compositions according to the invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the<br>
addition of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This<br>
irrigation may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation<br>
or underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.<br>
The concentrated suspensions; which can be applied by spraying, are prepared so<br>
as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually<br>
contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5<br>
to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of thixotropic<br>
agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming<br>
agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the<br>
carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or<br>
insoluble Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrierto<br>
help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they<br>
contain from about 10 to about 80%: by weight of active ingredient, from about20 to<br>
about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from<br>
about 3jLo about 10% of a dispersing.agent and,, when- necessary, from about 0 to<br>
about80% of one or more stabilizers and/or otheradditives, such" as penetrating56<br>
agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these<br>
wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender<br>
with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is '<br>
ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the<br>
wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous. They may be<br>
suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be<br>
employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage.<br>
The "water dispersible granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in<br>
water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable<br>
powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the<br>
wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient<br>
with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous<br>
solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a<br>
dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).<br>
The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to<br>
the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use thereof.<br>
Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod or plant<br>
nematode pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more<br>
particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more<br>
compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the<br>
compounds of the invention, together with other substances toxic to arthropods or<br>
plant nematodes, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers). The actual<br>
compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to achieve the<br>
desired effect(s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary<br>
practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liquid compositions for application topically to animals, timber, stored<br>
products or household goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about 90%,<br>
more particularly from about 0.001 % to about 10%, by weight of one or more<br>
compounds of the invention. For administration to animals orally or parenterally,<br>
including percutaneously solid or liquid compositions, these normally contain from<br>
about p. l°/q to about 9,0% by weight of one or mora compounds of- the invention:<br>
Medicate,ct feedstuffs, normally'contain from about 0.001% to ab'o'ut 3% by weight of<br>
one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing<br>
with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about<br>
5% to about 50%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral<br>
salt licks normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 10% by weight of one or more<br>
compounds of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or outdoor<br>
areas may contain from about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about<br>
0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about<br>
20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5.0 ppm. of one or more<br>
compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish farming with<br>
appropriate exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01 % to about<br>
5%, preferably from about 0.01 % to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other<br>
means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species,<br>
age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the nature and degree of its actual or<br>
potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to<br>
about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20.0 mg, per kg body weight of the<br>
animal or doses of about 0.01 to abqut 20-0 rng, preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0<br>
mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are<br>
generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration. By use of sustained release<br>
formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may be<br>
combined and administered to^^ animals on g single ocpasion.<br>

METHODS OF PESTiCIDAL USE<br>
The following representative test procedures, using compounds of the<br>
invention, were conducted to determine the parasiticidal and insecticidal activity of"<br>
the compounds of the invention.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
Method A: Screening method to test systemicity of compounds against<br>
Ctenpcephalides felis (Gat flea)<br>
A test container was filled with 10 adults of Ctenocephalides felis. A glass cylinder<br>
was closed on one end with parafilm and placed on top of the test container. The<br>
test compound solution was then pipetted into bovine blood and added to the glass<br>
cylinder. The treated Ctenocephalides felis were held in this artificial dog test (blood<br>
37 °C, 40-60 % relative humidity; Ctenocephalides felis 20-22°C, 40-60 % relative<br>
humidity) and assessment performed at 24 and 48 hours after application.<br>
Compound numbers 1-04, 1-10, 2-01; 2-04, 2-19, 2-22, 2-31 and 4-01 gave at least<br>
90% control of Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 5ppm or less.<br>
Method B: Screening method to test contact activity of compounds against<br>
Ctenocephalides felis (Cat flea)<br>
Solutions of the test compounds were dropped onto filter paper, dried and the filter<br>
paper placed into test tubes and infested with 10 adults of Ctenocephalides felis.<br>
The treated Ctenocephalides felis were held in a climate chamber (26°C, 80% RH)<br>
and the percentage efficacy assessed 24 hours and 48 hours after application in<br>
comparison with the untreated control/<br>
Compound numbers 1-04, 2-01 and 2-O4 gave at least 70% contact control of<br>
Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 1000 ppm.<br>
Method C: Screening method to test contact activity against Rhipicephalus<br>
sanguineus (Brown dbg tick)<br>
Solutions of the test compounds were d ropped onto.filter paper, dried and the filter<br>
paper placed into test tubes and infested with 20-30 iarvae'(L1) of Rhipicephalus" :<br>
sanguineus and the tubes closed with a clip. The treated Rhipicephalus sanguineus<br>
were held in a climate chamber (25°C, 90% RH) and the percentage efficacy<br>
assessed 24 hours after application in comparison with the untreated control.<br>
Compound numbers 1-04, 1-10, 2-01, 2-04 and 9-05 gave at least 70% contact<br>
control of Rhipicephalus sanguineus at a test concentration of 100 ppm.<br>
Method D: Diabrotica undecimpunctata (southern corn rootworm) screen<br>
Two days before application, seeds of maize were soaked in water under warm<br>
conditions to elicit fast germination. One day before application, eggs of Diabrotica<br>
undecimpunctata were transferred to one half of a Japanese filter paper placed in a<br>
plastic petri dish. Afterwards, a sprouted maize seed was placed on a moistened<br>
pad beside the filter paper. Three drops of 200 microlitres of test compound<br>
solution were carefully pipetted onto the egg. The remainder of the solution was<br>
placed on the maize and then the Petri dish was closed. The treated eggs in the<br>
Petri dishes were held in a climate chamber for 6 days: The compound efficacy<br>
(percentage of dead eggs and/or larvae in comparison to untreated control) was<br>
assessed 6 days after application using a binocular microscope.<br>
Compound numbers 1-31, 9-04, 9-05 and 9-09 gave at least 90% control of<br>
Diabrotica undecimpunctata at a test concentration of 10ppm.<br>
Method E: Nilaparvata lugens (Rice brown planthopper) screen<br>
The leaves of rice plants were dipped for 5 seconds into an aqueous solution of the<br>
formulated preparation to be examined. After the solution had run off, the rice<br>
plants were placed in a Petri dish and populated with about 20 larvae (L3 stage) of<br>
the rice leafhopper species Nilaparvata lugens. The Petri dish was closed and then<br>
stored in a climatized chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40 - 60% relative<br>
atmospheric humidity). After 6 days storage, the mortality among the leafhopper<br>
larvae was determined.<br>
Compound numbers 9-04, 9-05, 9-07, 9-09, 9-25 and 9-26 gave at least 90%<br>
control of Nilaparvata lugens at a test concentration of lOpprrK';<br>
Method F: &gt; -Aphis fabaev(Black beSn aphicl) screen<br>
Germinated field bean seeds (Vicia faba) with roots were transferred into bottles<br>
filled with tap water. Aqueous solutions (4ml) of the formulated preparation to be<br>
examined were dropped into the bottle. The plants were then infested with<br>
approximately 100 black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) and stored in a controlledenvironment<br>
cabinet at approximately 25° C. After 3 and 6 days storage, the effect<br>
of the preparation on the aphids was determined.<br>
Compound numbers 1-19, 1-31, 9-05, 9-09 and 11-05 gave at least 90% control of<br>
Aphis fabae at a test concentration of 10ppm.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
