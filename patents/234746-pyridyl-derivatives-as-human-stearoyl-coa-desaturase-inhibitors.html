PYRIDYL DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generafty tc the fieW of inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, such as pyridine derivatives, and uses for such compounds in treating and/or preventing various human diseases nckxJng those mediated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzymes, preferably SCD! esoeciaiy cfeeases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease diabetes aoesry netabofec syndrome and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acyl desaturase enzymes catalyze the taraatari of double bonds in fatty acids derived from either dietary sources or de novo synthesis in the liver. Mammals synthesize at least three fatty acid desaturases of Offering chain length specificity that catalyze the addition of double bonds at the detta-9 detta-5; and delta-5 positions. Stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) introduce a double bond in the C9-C10 position of saturated fatty acids. The preferred substrates are palmrtoyl-CoA (16:0) and stearoyl-CoA (18:0), which are converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1) and oleoyl-CoA (18:1), respectively. The resulting mono-unsaturated fatty acids are substrates for incorporation into phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters.<br>
A number of mammalian SCD genes have been cloned. For example, two genes have been cloned from rat (SCD1, SCD2) and four SCD genes have been isolated from mouse (SCD1, 2, 3, and 4). Whie the basic biochemical role of SCD has been known in rats and mice since the 1970s (Jeffcoat R. et a/., Elsevier Science (1984), Vol, 4, pp. 85-112; de Antueno, RJ. Upkis (1993), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 285-290), it has only recently been directly implicated in human disease processes.<br>
A single SCD gene, SCD1, has been characterized in humans. SCD1 is described in Brownlie et a/, PCT published patent application, WO 01/62954, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A second human SCD isoform has recently been identified, and because it bears little sequence homology to alternate mouse or rat isoforms it has been named human SCD5 or hSCD5 (PCT published patent appfcation, WO 02/26944, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
To date, no small-moteculet drug-like compounds are known that specifically inhibit or modulate SCD activity. Certain long-chain hydrocarbons have been used historically to study SCD activity. Known examples include thia-fatty acids,<br><br>
cycbpropenoid fatty acids, and certain conjugated iinoteic acid Isomers. Specifically, c/s-12, frans-10 conjugated Iinoteic acid is believed to inhibit SCD enzyme activity and reduce the abundance of SCD1 mRNA whfie c?s-9 trans-l 1 conjugated linoleic acid does not Cycbpropenoid fatty acids, such as those found in stercula and cotton seeds, are also known to inhibit SCD activity   Few example, sterculic acid (8-(2-octylcyclopropenyl)octanoic add) and ma*vafoc acid fM2-oc*yteydopropenyI)heptanoic acid) are C18 and C16 derivatives of stercuoy and mafrvaioyl fatty acids, respectively, having cyclopropene rings at ther C9-C1C aostean   These agents are believed to inhibit SCD enzymatic activity by direct rteradcr win ihe enzyme, thus inhibiting delta-9 desaturation. Other agents that may mi* SCD activity include thia-fatty acids, such as S-thiastearic acid (also caiec 3-noryihocctanoic acid) and other fatty acids with a sutfoxy moiety.<br>
These known modulators of detta-9 desaturase activity are not useful for treating the diseases and disorders linked to SCD1 biological activity. None of the known SCD inhibitor compounds are setective for SCD or defta-9 desaturases, as they also inhibit other desaturases and enzymes. The thia-fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids and cyclopropene fatty acids (mafvalic acid and sterculic acid) are neither useful at reasonable physiological doses, nor are they specific inhibitors of SCD1 biological activity, rather they demonstrate cross inhibition of other desaturases, in particular the delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases by the cyclopropene fatty acids.<br>
The absence of small molecule inhibitors of SCD enzyme activity is a major scientific and medical disappointment because evidence is now compelling that SCD activity is directly implicated in common human disease processes: See e.g., Attie, A.D. ef a/., "Relationship between stearoyt-CoA desa&amp;jrase activity and plasma triglycerides in human and mouse hypertriglyceridemia", J. Lipid Res. (2002), Vol. 43, No. 11, pp. 1899-907; Cohen, P. et a/., "Rote for stearoyt-CoA desaturase-1 in leptin-mediated weight loss", Science (2002), VoL 297. No. 5579, pp. 240-3, Ntambi, J. M. et a/., "Loss of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 function protects mice against adiposity", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. (2002), Vol. 99, No. 7. pp. 11482-6.<br>
The present invention solves this problem by presenting new classes of compounds that are useful in modulating SCD activity and regulating lipid levels, especially plasma lipid levels, and which are useful in the treatment of SCD-mediated diseases such as diseases related to dyslipktemia and disorders of lipid metabolism, especially diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and the like.<br><br>

The compounds identified in the instant specification inhibit the desaturation of various fatty acids (such as the C9-C10 desaturation of stearoyt-CoA) which is accomplished by delta-9 desaturases, such as stearoyi-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). As such these compounds inhibit the formation of various fatty acids and downstream metabolites thereof. This may lead to an accumulation of stearoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA and other upstream precursors of various fatty acids; which may possibly result in<br><br>
a negative feedback loop causing an overall change in fatty aad metabolism. Any of these consequences may ultimately be responsible for the overaB therapeutic benefit provided by these compounds.<br>
Typically, a successful SCD inhibitory therapeutic agent w* meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20%   Animal mode* efficacy is less than about 2 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 0.5 mg/Kg and the target human dose is between 50 and 250 mg/70 Kg, although doses outside of thrs range may be acceptable.(Hmg/Kg' means milligrams of compound per kflcgrarr of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The therapeutic moex 
The identification of compounds of the invention as SCD inhibitors was readily accomplished using the SCD enzyme and microsomal assay procedure described in Brownlie et al, supra. When tested in this assay, compounds of the HTvention had less than 50% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, preferably less than 40% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, more preferably less than 30% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, and even more preferably less than 20% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, thereby demonstrating that the compounds of the invention are potent rnhixtors of SCD activity.<br>
These results provide the basis for analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and SCD. Certain R groups tend to provide more<br><br>
potent inhibitory compounds. SAR analysis is one of the tools those stalled in the art may now employ to identify preferred embodiments of the compounds of the invention for use as therapeutic agents.<br>
Other methods of testing the compounds disclosed herein are aisc readtfy available to those skilled in the art. Thus, in addition, said corracfcng may be accomplished in vivo. In one such embodiment said contacting r stec \a) s accomplished by administering said chemical agent to an anrrsaf dFfk^ieo «vtfh a triglyceride (TG&gt;- or very low density lipoprotein (VLDt Healed asoroes and subsequently detecting a change in plasma triglyceride level r sae amma* thereby identifying a therapeutic agent useful in treating a triglyceride *T3&gt; ^ very on density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related disorder. In such embodiment tie anrr» r^ay be a human, such as a human patient afflicted with such a disorder and r neec zf u sail mart of said disorder.<br>
In specific embodiments of such in vivo processes, saic change in SCD1 activity in said animal is a decrease in activity, preferably wherein sakj SCD1 modulating agent does not substantially inhibit the biological activity of a detta-5 desaturase, delta-6 desaturase or fatty acid synthetase.<br>
The model systems useful for compound evaluation may include, but are not limited tot the use of liver microsomes, such as from mice that have been maintained on a high carbohydrate diet, or from human donors, including persons suffering from obesity. Immortalized cell lines, such as HepG2 (from human iver), MCF-7 (from human breast cancer) and 3T3-L1 (from mouse adipocytes) may also be used. Primary cell lines, such as mouse primary hepatocytes, are also useful n testing the compounds of the invention. Where whole animate are used, mice used as a source of primary hepatocyte cells may also be used wherein the mice have been maintained on a high carbohydrate diet to increase SCD activity in mirocrosomes and/or to etevate plasma triglyceride levels (i.e., the 18:1/18:0 ratio); alternatively mice on a normal diet or mice with normal triglyceride levels may be used. Mouse modete employing transgenic mice designed for hypertriglyceridemia are also avaiabie as is the mouse phenome database. Rabbits and hamsters are also useful as animal models, especially those expressing CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein).<br>
Another suitable method for determining the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the invention is to indirectly measure their impact on inhibition of SCD enzyme by measuring a subject's Desaturation Index after administration of the compound. "Desaturation Index" as employed in this specification means the ratio of the product over the substrate for the SCD enzyme as measured from a given tissue sample. This<br><br>
may be calculated using three different equations 18:1n-9/18:C lOtec ac*d over stearic acid); 16:1n-7/16:0 (palmrtoleic acid over palmitic acid); and/or 16:1 n-7 + 18:1rw716:0 (measuring all reaction products of 16:0 desaturation over 16:0 substrate) Desaturation Index is primarily measured in liver or plasma triglycerides but may also be measured in other selected lipid fractions from a variety of fessues   Desaturation Index, generally speaking, is a tool for plasma Bpid profffing<br>
A number of human diseases and disorders are the resjjr dt aberrant SCD1 biological activity and may be ameliorated by modulation of SCO" ooogicaf activity using the therapeutic agents of the invention.<br>
Inhibition of SCD expression may also affect the fatty aac ^onpcsibor of membrane phospholipids, as well as production or levels of tngfycendes and. cholesterol esters. The fatty acid composition of phospholipids utrr^tety determines membrane fluidity, while the effects on the composition of triglycerides and chotesterol esters can affect lipoprotein metabolism and adiposity.<br>

Preparation of Mouse Liver Microsomes:<br>
Male ICR mice, on a high-carbohydrate, low fat diet under Bght hatohane (15% in mineral oil) anesthesia are sacrificed by exsanguination during periods of high enzyme activity. Livers are immediately rinsed with cold 0.9% NaCI solution, weighed and minced with scissors. All procedures are performed at4°C unless specified otherwise. Livers are homogenized in a solution (1:3 w/v) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 62 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.15 M KCI, 1.5 mM /V-acetyleysteine, 5 mM MgCI2, and 0.1 mM EDTA using 4 strokes of a Potter-Efvehjem tissue homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged at 10,400 x g for 20 mm to eiminate mitochondria and cellular debris. The supernatant is filtered through a 3-iayer cheesecloth and centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 60 min. The microsomal petet is gentiy resuspended in the same homogenization solution with a small glass/teflon homogenizer and stored at -70°C. The absence of mitochondrial contamination is enzymatically assessed. The protein concentration is measured using bovine serum albumin as the standard.<br>
