In the present invention the main sub-system of the multi-channel intrinsically safe real-time environmental monitoring system for underground mines is the microprocessor based data station (1) which is kept in underground mine (2) and<br>
connected to a computer (19) at the surface through RS-422 link (5). The real time data is obtained from this device and logged onto the hard disk of the computer. These data can be displayed in the form of graphics including trends, bar charts in real time. Reports are generated from these data which are available as on-screen and hard copy printout can be obtained through printer (20). The data are also being stored in the hard disk at regular intervals. The underground data station (1) is placed inside the mine near the mine-face and connected to the computer (19). The microprocessor (1) is programmed to energize the relays (35) connected to a particular sensor with power supply (37) and signal processor (36), and thereby connecting the output of the sensor to the analog to digital converter channel (34). Similarly, data from any particular sensor is sent to analog to digital converter channel (34) for processing whenever required. The application software is developed in Visual Studio under Windows environment. The computer (19) at the control room runs the main program for collecting data from the underground data station (1). The data-station (1) continuously sends and receives data through the microprocessor (21) programmed in assembly language. It also sends requisite instruction to the underground data station (1) through the two-way communication link (5). The programme at the beginning selects the channels and the parameters to be monitored, and after proper handshaking is established with the data station (1), data starts coming to the computer screen channel-wise. Different windows can be opened to see the trend of data in different channels. Data is also stored channel-wise in a separate file in the hard disc. The stored data can further be analyzed for finding the average value, preferred parameter ratios and for other similar purposes. As the trends are more informative than absolute values, graphics software is utilized to represent and hard-copy graphs can be plotted against time.<br>

(v) provision of two-way communication, which is very much essential for taking up appropriate control measures whenever required from the surface.<br>
Installation of the monitoring system of the present invention in an underground mine should be done as follows:<br>
The microprocessor based data station (1) should be placed at a safe and dry place in the underground. Systematic lay down of cables (5 and 6) is very essential for proper data transmission. The cables (5 and 6) are multi pair twisted and armored (0.5 mm diameter or thicker copper conductor), having negligible inductance and capacitance. The cables (5 and 6) should be laid with least twists and kinks and fastened through clamps on the hard walls of side galleries. At every fifty meters clamps are to be fixed so that the cables remain stretched. A minimum distance of<br>
one meter should be maintained between the mine main power cable and the data cables (5 and 6) to avoid electromagnetic interferences. The sensor boxes (7-14) are to be fixed on the side-wall of the gallery of the mine. If possible the gas sensors (10-11) should preferably be hung from the roof of the gallery for optimum result.<br>
The complete software developed by us is menu driven, self-explanatory and does not require any prior sophisticated computer training. The software is designed to work in two modes, namely, on-line (real-time) and off-line. In on-line (real-time) mode the software automatically detects the connection with data station and configures itself appropriately for future communication and request for data of different sensors is sent to the data-station. The data station serves the request by sending the data of the required sensor and then computer retrieves the instantaneous data from the serial communication ports as per the connection. Finally the data is displayed numerically or graphically and automatically saved in a database file, the name of which corresponds to the system date. In off-line mode, one can display the pre-recorded data by simply selecting the file of the required date. Different windows could be opened for viewing graphical simulation of the data of different channels. Both operating modes of the software support hard copy printing of data such as numerical or graphical as required. Various statistical analysis operations like maximum, minimum, average, moving average, standard deviation etc. are also incorporated. There are alarms and warning messages when a data crosses its safe limit in the on-line mode. For administrative works like changing channel configurations, enough security has been maintained through the use of passwords.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the multi-channel intrinsically safe real-time environmental monitoring system for underground mines and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
The monitoring system of the present invention was first installed at Jhanjra 1&amp;2 incline, being worked by longwall method of working, of Eastern Coalfields Limited,<br>
Sanctoria, Burdwan, West Bengal, India, with all the accessories. The system was<br>
operated on an experimental basis for over six months.<br>
Different sensors were located at various working locations in the underground<br>
mines. The parameters monitored during the period were temperature, air velocity,<br>
machine status, methane concentration and carbon monoxide concentration with the<br>
range of 26-35°C, 0.5-2.9 m/s, ON - OFF, 0-1.1 %, 0-12 ppm, respectively.<br>
The system successfully provided warning signals as well as visual interpretation of<br>
simultaneous graphs for particular sensor when temperature and air velocity crossed<br>
the threshold limit of 30°C and 1.1  m/s, respectively. Subsequently, corrective<br>
measures were implemented by the management to bring the respective parameter<br>
within the threshold limit.<br>
The total system was successfully operated in the mine and managed from the<br>
surface control room through two-way communication facility.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
The monitoring system of the present invention was installed for a second trial in a<br>
mine worked by Board and Pillar method of mining. The monitoring system was<br>
installed and operated in the Sudamdih shaft mine of Bharat Coking Coal Limited,<br>
Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India, on an experimental basis for a period of around six<br>
months.<br>
All the five category of sensors were installed at various working locations in the<br>
mine. The range of parameters were 27-36°C, 0.6-3.1 m/s, ON - OFF, 0 - 0.9 % and<br>
0-15 ppm for temperature, air velocity, machine status, methane concentration and<br>
carbon monoxide concentration, respectively.<br>
The system provided audio-visual warning signal for a particular sensor when<br>
temperature and air velocity crossed the pre-set threshold value of 30°C and 1.1<br>
m/s,  respectively. All the additional features of the system were successfully<br>
operated in the mine through out the field trial period.<br>
The  system   indicated   an  excellent  representation  data   of  the   underground<br>
environmental conditions during the reopening of the sealed off area by the mine<br>
management. This enabled the mine management to assess the environmental<br>
conditions and to take the necessary precautionary measures as and when required.<br>
The total system was successfully operated in the mine and managed from the surface control room through two-way communication facility.-<br>
The total monitoring system of the present invention essentially enabled the smooth functioning of the underground mining operations. This system also helped the mine management to enhance the safety and productivity at different underground working environments and mining methods. Provision of multi-channel facility helped in monitoring of various parameters at any number of locations in the big underground mines and consumed less power by using same signal processor for all the similar sensors. The facility for real-time continuous monitoring of carbon monoxide enabled the mine management to reduce the workers' exposure level and duration to the noxious gas by taking appropriate measures at the earliest. The development of semiconductor based methane and carbon monoxide sensors consumed less power and provided higher sensivity, which helped to reduce the cost of operation and to provide accurate result. All the data were analysed by the mine management from the surface control room through simultaneous visual interpretation of trend of monitored data by a high quality graphic software. The system also imparted audio-visual warning signal when any particular parameter crossed the respective threshold limit which helped the mine management to take immediate corrective measures and thus avoid occurrence of a catastrophe. The provision of two-way communication helped the mine management to take up appropriate control measures whenever required from the surface and reduced the delay in the process.<br>
Therefore, it is conclusively shown that the novel features enabled by the inventive steps of the multi-channel intrinsically safe real-time environmental monitoring system for underground mines of the present invention essentially proved useful for the mine management for better safety and enhancement of productivity.<br>
