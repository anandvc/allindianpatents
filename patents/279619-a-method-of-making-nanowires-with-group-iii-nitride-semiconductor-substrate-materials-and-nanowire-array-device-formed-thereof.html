Related Apptications<br>
[0002]	This appiication claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Applications Ser. No. 60/780,833, filed March 10, 2006, Ser. No. 60/798,337, filed May 8, 2006, Ser. No. 60/808,153, filed May 25, 2006, and Ser. No. 60/889,363, filed February 12,2007, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0003]	This invention relates generally to semiconductor materials, devices,<br>
and methods for their manufacture and, more particularly, relates to semiconductor nanowires and senriiconductor nanowire active devices.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
[0004]	Nanowires composed of group li!-N alloys {e.g., GaN) provide the<br>
potential for new semiconductor device configurations such as nanoscaie optoelectronic devices. For example, GaN nanowires can provide large bandgap, high melting point, and chemical stability that is useful for devices operating in corrosive or high-temperature environments, The larger bandgap of GaN and its related alloys also allows the fabrication of light sources in the visible range that are useful for displays and lighting applications. In addition, the unique geometry of<br>
 <br>
each nanowire offers the potential to explore new device paradigms in photonics and<br>
in transport devices. To fuiiy realize this potential, . scalable process is needed for<br>
mailing high-oL-ality group lll-N nanowires and/or nanowire arrays with precise and<br>
uniforrrs control of the geometry, position and crystaliinity of each nanowire.<br>
[00005]	Conventional nanowire fabrication is based on a vapor-liquid-soiid<br>
(VLS) growth mechanism, and involves the use of catalysts such 3S Au, N!, Fe, or in. Problems arise, however, because these convsniional catalytic processes cannot control the position and unifomity of the resulting nanowires. A further problem with conventional catalytic processes is that the catalyst is inevitably incorporated into the nanowires. This degrades the crystalline quality' of the resulting nanostruotures, which limits their applications.<br>
[0006]	Thus, there is a need to overcome these and other problems of the<br>
prior art and to provide high-quality nanowires and/or nanowire arrays, and scalable methods for their manufacturing. It is further desirable to provide nanowire photoelectronic devices and their manufactunng based on tine high-quality nanowires and/or nanowire an-ays.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	According to various embodiments, the present teachings include a<br>
method of making nanowires. In the method, a selective growth masl can be formed over a substrate. The selective growth mask can include a plurality of patterned apertures that expose a plurality of portions of the substrate. A semiconductor material can then be grown on each of the plurality of portions of the substrate exposed in each of the patterned apertures using a selective non-puised growth mode. The growth mode can be transitioned from the non-pulsed growth<br>
 <br>
mods to a puissd growth mode. By continuing the puised grawth mode of tae<br>
semiconductor material, a piuralit' of ssmiconducior nanowlres can be formed.<br>
[00008]	According to various embodiment. the present teachings also inciude<br>
a group III-N nanowire array, which can inciuds a selecnve growth masi; disposed<br>
over a substrate. The seiective growth mas!', can inciuds a plurality of patterned<br>
apertures that expose a plurality of portions of the substrate. A group fll-N nanowire<br>
can be connected to and extend from the exposed plurality of portions of the<br>
substrate and extend over a top of the selective growth mask. The group |[|-N<br>
nanowire can be oriented along a single direction and can maintain a oross-sectlona!<br>
feature of one of the piurality of selected surface regions.<br>
[0009]	According to various embodiments, the present teachings further<br>
Inciude a GaN substrate structure. The GaN substrate structure can be a GaN film coalesced from a plurality of GaN nanowlres, which is defect free. The GaN film can have a defect density of about 10' cm" or lower.<br>

[0025]	Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention, examples of which are Illustrated in ttie accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the<br>
drawings to refer to the same or like parts. In the following description, reference is<br>
made to the accompanying drawings that fonn a part thereof, and in which is shown<br>
byway of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be<br>
practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those<br>
skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood that other<br>
embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention. The following description is, therefore, merely exemplary.<br>
[00261	While the invention has been illustrated with respect to one or more<br>
impiemeniations, alterations and/or modifications can be made to the illustrated examples without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. In<br>
 <br>
addition, while a particular feature of the inventicin may have been disclosed wltn<br>
respect to only one of several impiementations, such feature maj' be combined; with<br>
one or more other features of the othe- implementations as may be desired and,<br>
advantageous for any given or oarticular function. Furthermore, 13 the s):tent that<br>
tne terms "including", "includes", "having", "has", "with", or variante thereof are used<br>
in either the detaiied description and the claims, such terms are intended to be<br>
inciusive in a manner similar to the term "comprising," The term "at least one of is<br>
used to mean one or more of the listed items can be selected.<br>
J0027]	Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth<br>
the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth<br>
in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value,<br>
however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard<br>
deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges<br>
disclosed herein are to be understood to encomipass any and all sub-ranges<br>
subsumed therein. For example, a range of "ie.ss than 10" can include any and a!!<br>
sub-ranges between (and including) the minimum value of zero and the maximum<br>
value of 10, that is, any and all sub-ranges having a minimum value of equal to or<br>
greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10, e.g., 1 to 5.<br>
[0Q28|	Exemplary embodiments provide semiconductor devices including<br>
high-quality (i,e., defect free) group Ili-H nanowlres and unifomn group Ill-N nanowire arrays as well as scalable processes for their manufacturing, where the position, orientation, cross-sectional features, length and/or Ifie crystallinity of each nanowire can fas precisely controlled. Specifically, a plurality of nanowlres and/or nanowire an-ays can be fomned using a selective growth mode followed by a growth-mode-transition from the selective growth mode to a puised growth mode. The cross-<br>
 <br>
sestional features, for example, the oross-sectlona! dimensions (e.g., diamsier or<br>
width), and the oross-sectJonal shapsE. of each nanowirB obtained from tm ssisotive<br>
pro&gt;v!h mods can be maintainsd by continuing the growth using tiie puissd growth<br>
mods, tn this manner, nanovwres with a high aspect ratio can be formed, in ars<br>
sxempiary embodiment the length of sach nanowirs can oe, for example, aoout 10<br>
nm to about 1000 microns, for example about 10 nm to about 100 microns.<br>
[QQ29I	in addition, high-quality group itI-N films, for example, high-quality GaK<br>
Aims, can be formed by terminating and coalescing the pluralitr of nanowires and/or<br>
nanowire arrays. These GaN films can be used as GaN substrate structures to<br>
facilitate the fabrication of GaN-based devices such as visible LEDs and lasers for<br>
the emerging soiid-state lighting and UV sensor industries.<br>
[0030]	Furthermore, because each of the pulsed-grown nanowires and/or<br>
nanowire arrays can provide nonpolar sidewalls, there are advantages in using a core-shell growth to build an MQW active shell structure on the sidewalls of each nanowire. Such core-shell nanowire/MQW active structures can be used in nanoscale photoeiectronic devices having high efficiencies, such as, for example, nanowire LEDs and/or nanowire lasers.<br>
[0031]	As used herein, the term "nanowire" generally refers to any elongated<br>
conductive or semiconductive material that includes at least one minor dimension, for example, one of the cross-sectional dimensions such as width or diameter, of less than or equal to about 1Q00 nm. In various embodiments, the minor dimension can be less than about 100 nm. In various other embodiments, the minor dimension can be less than about 10 nm. The nanowires can have an aspect ratio (e.g., length: width and/or major dimension: minor dimension) of about 100 or greater. In various embodiments, the aspect ratio can be about 200 or greater. In various other<br>
 <br>
embodiments, the aspect ratio can be about 2000 or greater, in art exemplar' ambodinnent, tiie cross-section of the nanowire can be highly asymmetric such tnsi in one direction of the cross-sectlonE! dimension can be much less than 1000 nm and In an orthogonal direction the dimension can be substaniialiy greater than 1000 nm,<br>
[0Q32]	!t is also intended that the term "nanowires" aiso encompass other<br>
elongated structures of like dimensions inciuding, but not limited to, nanoshafts,<br>
nanopiiiars, nanoneedles, nanorods, and nanotubes (e.g., single wall nanotubss, or<br>
multiwall nanotubes), and their various functionalized and dehvatized fibril forms,<br>
such as nanofibers in the form of thread, yarn, fabrics, etc.<br>
[00331	The nanowires can have various cross-sectional shapes, such as, for<br>
example, rectangular, polygonal, square, oval, or circular shape. Accordingly, the<br>
nanowires can have cylindrical and/or cone-like three dimensional (3-D) shapes. In<br>
various embodiments, a plurality of nanowires can be, for example, substantially<br>
parallel, arcuate, sinusoida!, etc., with respect to each other.<br>
[0034]	The nanowires can be formed on/from a support, which can include<br>
selected surface regions where the nanowires can be connected to and extend {e.g.,<br>
be grown) from, The support of the nanowires can also include a substrate formed<br>
from a variety of materials including Si, SIC, sapphire, lll-V semiconductor<br>
compounds such as GaN or GaAs, metals, ceramics or glass. The support of the<br>
nanowires can also include a selective growth masl
various embodiments, the support of the nanowires can further include a buffer layer<br>
disposed between the selective growth mask and the substrate.<br>
[0035J	In various embodiments, nanowire active devices, for example,<br>
nanowire LEDs or nanowire lasers, can be formed using the nanowires and/or<br>
 <br>
nanowtre arrays, io various embodimente, the nanowiras and/or nanowirs arrays<br>
and the nanowtre active devices can be formed using a IIS-V oompounc'<br>
semiconducror materials system, for eKampse.; the group \\\-H compound materials<br>
system. Examples of the group III elements can include Ga, In, or At, which can bs<br>
formed from exemplary group lii precursors, such as trimethylgallium (TMGa) ar<br>
triethylgaiiium (TEGa), trimethylindium (TMln) or trimethylaluminum (TMAt).<br>
Exempiary N precursors can be, for example, ammonia (NH3). Other group V<br>
elements can also be used, for example, P or As, with exemplarf group V<br>
precursors, such as tertiarybutylphoshine (TBP), or arsine (.AsHs).<br>
[00361	In the following description, group lll-N semiconductor alloy<br>
compositions can be described by the combination of group lll-N elements, such as,<br>
for example, GaH, AIN, InN, InGaN, AIGaN, or AllnGaN. Generally, the elements in<br>
a composition can be combined with various molar fractions. For example, the<br>
semiconductor alloy composition InGaN can stand for InxGaofN, where the moiar<br>
fraction, x, can be any number less than 1.00. in addition, depending on the molar<br>
fraction value, various active devices can be made by similar compositions. For<br>
example, an lno.3Gao.7N (where x is about 0.3) can be used in the MQW active region<br>
of LEDs for a blue light emission, while an Ina-aGaas/N (where x is about 0.43) can<br>
be used in the MQW active region of LEDs for a green light emission.<br>
[0037]	In various embodiments, the nanowires, nanowire arrays, and/or the<br>
nanowire active devices can include a dopant from a group consisting of. a p-type dopant from Group II of the periodic table, for example, Mg, Zn, Cd and Hg; a p-type dopant from Group IV of the periodic table, for example, C; or an n-type dopant selected from a group consisting of: Si, Ge, Sn, S, Se and Te.<br>
 <br>
10038]	In various smbodimsnts, the nanowirss and/or nanowire arrays as well<br>
as ths nanowire active devices can have high-qua!itv' heterogeneous structures gnc b-': formsc' by various crystai growth techniques inclLiding, but not iimitee to. meta!-orgEnic chemica! vapor deoosition (MOCVD) (also known as organometalilc vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE)), moiecuiar-beam epitaxy (MBE), gas source IVIBE (3SW1BE), metal-organic MBE (MOMBE), atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), or hydride vapor phase epitax/ (HVPE),<br>
[0039]	In various embodiments, a multiple-phase growth mode, for example, a<br>
two-phase growth mods, can be used for the high-quality crystal growth of nanowires<br>
and/or nanowire arrays as well as nanowire active devices. For example, a first<br>
phase growth mode such as a selective growth mode can be used to provide a<br>
condition for growth selectivity and nudeation of the nanowires and/or nanowire<br>
arrays. In the selective growth mode, standard crystai growth methods, for example,<br>
standard MOCVD, can be used to nucleate the growth of the nanowires with a<br>
desired thickness of, for example, about 10 nm or more.<br>
[0040]	The second phase growth mode can create a process to continue the<br>
growth of each nanowire and maintain its cross-sectional features from the first growth mode, and also provide an arbitrary desired length. The second phase growth mode can be applied by a growth-mode-transition, which can tenninate the first phase growth mode, in the second phase grovirth mode, a pulsed growth mode, for example, a pulsed MOCVD growth, can be used.<br>
[0041]	As used herein, the terni "pulsed growth mode" refers to a process in<br>
which the group 111 and group V precursor gases are introduced alternately in a crystal growth reactor with a designed sequence. For example, TMGa and NH3 can be used as tjie precursors for an exemplary formation of GaN nanowires and/or<br>
 <br>
nanowire arrays and/or GaN nanowire active devices, in the puised growth mods, TMGa and NHa can be introduced alternately in a sequencs that introduces TM3&amp;. wliTi E designed fiovv rate (s.g., aoout 1C; seem) for a certain Deriod of time (E.g., about 20 seconds) foliowed by introducing NHa with a designed fiow rate (e.g., about 1500 seem) for a time period (e.g., about 30 seconds). In various embodiments, one cr more sequence loops can be conducted (e.g., repeated) tor a designed iengtli of each nanowire. in various embodiments, the growth rate of each nano&gt;wire can be orientation dependent.<br>
[0042]	In various embodiments, dielectric materials can be involved in<br>
formation of the disclosed nanowires, nanowire arrays, and/or nanowire active devices. For example, Uie selective growth mask can be made of dielectric materials during the formation of the plurality of nano\wires and/or nanowire arrays, in another example, dielectric materials can be used for electrical isolation for active devices such as nanowire LEDs and/or nanowire lasers. As used herein, the dielectric materials can include, but are not limited to, silicon dioKide (SiOz), silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxynitride (SiON), fiuorinated silicon dioxide (SiOF), silicon oxycarbide (SiOC), hafnium oxide (HfOz), hafnium-silicate (HfSiO), nitride hafnium-silicate (HfSiON), zirconium oxide (ZrOa), aluminum oxide (AlaOg), barium strontium titanate (BST), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), zirconium silicate (ZrSiOa), tantalum oxide (Ta02) or other insulating materials. According to various other embodiments, a conducting metal growth mask, such as, for example, tungsten can be used for selective growth of the disclosed nanowires.<br>
[00431	Exemplary embodiments for semiconductor devices of nanowires<br>
and/or nanowire arrays and their scaieable processes for growth are shown In FIGS. 1A-1C, FIGS. 2-3, FIGS. 4.AC, FIG. 5, and FIGS. 6A-BD.<br>

For exampis, the cleaning processes can include an ex-situ cieaning (i.e., the cleaning is conducted outside the growth reactor) followed by an in-situ cleaning (i.e., the cleaning is conducted within the growth reactor). Depending on materials used for e selective growth mask 135, various cieaning methods can be used.

grown from the exposed plurality of surface portions 139 of the substrate 110 to fill each of the plurality of patterned apertures 138, which can be defined by the selective growth mask 135. The selective growth mask 135 can serve as a selective growth mold to negatively replicate its nanopatterns from the plurality' of patterned apertures 138 to the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140. In this manner, the position and the cross-seciional features, such as the shape and dimensions, of each of the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140 can be determined by that of each patterned aperture of the plurality of patterned apertures 138. For example, the plurality of patterned apertures 138 can include a hexagonal array with a dimension of about 250 nm. The hexagonal array can then be transferred to the growth of the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140 with a similar or smaller dimension of about 250 nm or less, in another example, if the one or more apertures of the plurality of patterned apertures 138 are approximately circular with an exemplary diameter of about 100 nm, one or more nuclei of the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140 can be grown in the circular apertures with a similar diameter of about 100 nm or less. Thus, the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140 can be positioned in a well-defined location and shaped con-espondingly to the plurality of the patterned apertures 138 defined by the selective growth mask 135. in various embodiments, the plurality of<br>

The plurality of nanowlres 145 can be formed of the same material of the nanostructure nuclei 140, for example, GaN, AIN, InN, InGaN, AllnGaN, or AlGaN, In various embodiments, heterostructures can be formed fomi each of the plurality of nanowlres 145.

As shown, the nanowire device 200 can include a buffer layer 220 disDosed between a substrate such as the substrate 110 and a seiective growth masK such as the selective growth mask 135 (see FIGS. 1A-1C). in various embodiments, the buffer layer 220 can be a planar semiconductor film formed of, for example, Gals!, AIN, SnN, inGaN, AllnGaN or AlGaN, by, for example, standard MOCVD. In various embodiments, the thickness of the buffer layer 220 can be, for example, about 100 nm to about 10 um. In various embodiments, the buffer layer 220 can be doped with either an n-type or a p-type dopant in order to provide an electrical connection to the lower end of each nanowire of the plurality of nanowires 140.

selective growth 310 can be terminated by starting a pulsed growth 320 (I.E., growlh-<br>
mode-transition) at a transition time ti. Tiie pulsed growth 320 can further include a<br>
number of pulsed sequences, for example, a first sequence loop 324, a second<br>
sequence loop 328 and/or additional sequence loops, In various embodiments, the<br>
first sequence loop 324 can be repeated as the second sequence loop 328.<br>
[00571	In an exemplary embodiment for the formation of GaN nanowires<br>
and/or nanowre an-ays, the first gas flow curve 302 can be plotted for a first precursor gas such as trimethylgallium (TMGa), and the second gas flow curve 305 can be plotted for a second precursor gas such as ammonia (NH3). During the selective growth 310, the exempiary GaN nanowires and/or nanowire arrays can be formed in a MOCVD reactor including the first precursor gas TMGa with a constant flow rate of about 10 seem, and the second precursor gas NH3 with a constant flow rate of about 1500 seem. That means, during the selective growth 310, the precursor gases (i.e., TWlGa and NHg) can be flowed continuously, not pulsed (i.e., both Group III and Group V precursor gases are provided to the substrate together in a continuous, non-pulsed growth mode), Moreover, the group V precursor gas (e.g., TMGa) and group III precursor gas (e.g. NH3) can be introduced simultaneously and the group V/ group III ratio can be maintained, for example, at about 100 to about 500. In an exemplary embodiment, the group V/ group 111 ratio can be maintained at<br>
 <br>
about 150. Further, other reEotor conditions for tins seisctive growth 310 can<br>
includs, forexampls, an initiai reaction temperature of about 1015 °C to S'DDU: IQS-C<br>
°C, a rsastor pressure cf about 100 Torr, and a hydrogsn/nitrogen earner gas-<br>
mixture having a laminar flow of about 4000 seem. Any suitaols WIOCVC; raactor<br>
may be used, such as the Vssco TurboDisk model P75 MOCVD reactor in which the<br>
substrE'css are rotated at a higl"; speed during deposition.<br>
[0058|	During pulsed growth 320, the first precursor csas such as TMGa and<br>
the second precursor gas such as NHs can be introduced alternately into the growth reactor in a designed sequence, for example, shown as the first sequence loop 324. In various embodiments, the duration of each alternating step within the puised sequence can affect the growth of the nanowires and/or nanowire arrays, which can further be optimized tor specific reactor geometries. For example, in the first pulsed sequence loop 324, TMGa can be introduced with a flow rate of about 10 seem for a certain period of time such as about 20 seconds (not illustrated) followed by, for example, a 10 second carrier-gas purge (e.g., a mixture of hydrogen/nitrogen ) during which no precursor gases are introduced, and followed by introducing NH3 with a flow rate of about 1500 seem for a time period such as about 30 seconds (not illustrated) followed by, for example, a 10 second carrier-gas purge (e.g., a mixture of hydrogen/nitrogen) with no precursor gases involved. Other pulse durations may also be used depending on the reactor configurations, such as for example 15-40 seconds for the Group 111 reactant, 15-40 seconds for the Group V reactant and 5-15 seconds for the purge gases between each reactant introduction step. In various embodiments, the puised sequence such as the first sequence loop 324 can be repeated until a certain length of the GaN nanowires is reached. For example, the sequence loop 324 can be repeated as the second sequence loop 328, the third<br>
 <br>
sequence loop (not iliustrated) and so on. In each sequence loop, the group V<br>
precursor gas (e.g., TMGa) and grout' Iv: orecLTsor ga? (e.g. NH3) can have an<br>
effective V/lll ratio in a range ov. fc;- exampie, from about 6C to about 300. in various.<br>
embodiments, ths temperature, reactor pressure, and carrier gas fiow for the pulsed<br>
growth 320 can remain at their same settings m tor the selective growth 310. One<br>
of ordinar\f skill in the art will understand that the disclosed growth parameters are<br>
exemplar)' and can var' depending on the specific reactor used.<br>
[0059]	in various embodiments, the transition time (ti) can be determined by<br>
the duration of the selective growth 310. The transition time (ti) can be dependent on the growth rate inside each aperture, for example, each of the plurality of patterned apertures 138 shown in FIGS. 1-2. The growth rate inside each aperture can in turn depend on the gas flows (e.g., shown as gas flow curves 302 and 304) of each precursor gas and the geometry of each aperture of the plurality of patterned apertures 138. This geometrical dependence can occur because the growth nutrients, for example, from TMGa and/or NH3, can be deposited both on the selective growth masic and in the open apertures. During selective growth 310, the nutrient that deposits on the selective growth mask can have a high surface mobility and can either leave the mask surface or, if it is close enough to an open aperture, diffuse to that aperture and contribute to the growth rate in that aperture. This additional growth rate contribution can therefore vary based on the size of the apertures and the distance between frie apertures. In an exemplary embodiment for forming a plurality of GaN nanowires and/or nanowire an-ays, the growth-mode-transition can occur after a 1 minute duration of the selective growth (i.e., ti=1 minute), which can be experimentally determined by the GaN growth rate inside the patterned apertures. For example, the GaN growth rate can be about 0.6 nm/hr and<br>

the psttemed apertures can bs In the form of a hexagonsi srray naving g dismeter of about 200 nm and s pitch of about 1 urn.<br>
fOOSOJ	in various smbodimente, the growth of tn; amralit)' of nsnowires and/or<br>

For example, ths growtii-mode-transition can be applied after growth of the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 140 protrude overfrie top of the selective growth masf {such as 135 seen in FIGS. 1-2). in various embodiments, different configurations/dimensions can be obtained for the nanowires and/or nanowire arrays, depending on whether the growth-mode-transitlon is applied "before" (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 1-2) or "after" the nanowire nuclei have grown to protrude over the top of the selective growth mask.<br>
[00611	FIGS. 4A-4C depict a third exemplary semiconductor nanowire device<br>
400 formed by having a growth-mode-transition "after" the nanowire nuclei have grown to protrude over the top of the selective growth mask. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skil! in the art that ths nanowire device 400 depicted in FIGS. 4A-4C represents a generalized schematic illustration and that other layers/nanowires can be added or existing iayers/nanowires can be removed or modified.<br>
[0062]	In FIG. 4A, the device 400 can include a similar structure and be<br>
formed by a similar fabrication process as described in FIG. 1C for the device 100. As shown, yie device 400 can include a substrate 410, a selective growth mask 435 and a plurality of nanostructure nucEei 440.. The selective growth mask 435 and the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 440 can be formed over the substrate 410, wherein tiie plurality of nanostructure nuclei 440 can be interspersed through the selective growth mask 435.<br>

Likewise, the pluraiiti' c--nanostruciure nuctei 440 can bs formed simiiarh' to that of the piuraiity of nanostructure nuclei 140 of the device 100 shown in FIG. 1B. For sxannpie, the piuraiity of nanostructurs nuclei 440 can be fomned by first forming a plurality' of patterned apertures (not shown) defined by the ssiective growth masi' 435 over the substrate 410. Each of the piuraiity of patterned apertures can then be filled by growing a semiconductor material (e.g., GaN) therein using, for example, standard MOCVD. The plurality of nanostructure nuclei 440 can have a thickness of the selective growth mask 435, for example, about 30 nm, and a cross-sectional dimension, such as a width or a diameter, of, for example, about 10 nm to about 200 nm. And as an additional example, the width or diameter of the cross-seotiona! dimension can be about 10 nm to about 100 nm,<br>
[00S4]	in FIG. 4B, the device 400 can include a piuraiity/ of nanostructures 442<br>
grown laterally as well as vertically from the plurality of nanostructure nuciei 440, when the growth-mode-transition occurs "after" the plurality of nanostructure nuclei 440 proimdes over the top of the selective growth mask 435. For example, each of the plurality of nanostructures 442 can be grown laterally, spreading sideways, and partially on the surface of the selective growth mask 435. In various embodiments, the plurality of nanostructures 442 can include a pyramid-shaped structure providing a top crystal facet. For example, a plurality of GaN pyramid-shaped nanostructures can include a (0001) top facet and the dimensions of this top facet can be controlled by the extent of the growth of each nanostructure. Specifically, at the early stage of the growth, when the plurality of nanostructures 442 is growing laterally and partially<br>
 <br>
on the surface of ths selective growth mask 435, the toD racst dimensions can be increased and be broader than the cros&amp;-aecBQnal dimension? of ihe Diuraiits' of nanostructure nuclei ML. When the growth is continued, the rap facsi dimensions can De aecreased such that a point of the top facet dimensions can be smaller than tiiat of the plurality of nanostructure nuciel 44D. Therefore, the dimensions of each pyramid top facet can be controiled oy, for example, a terminatian of ths seiective growth mode (i.e., to apply the growth-mode-transition) to stop the growth of tns plurality of pyramid-shaped nanostructures. In various embodiments, ths exemplary pyramid-shaped top facets can be truncated and the dimension of each truncated top facet can then be maintained for the subsequent growth of the nanowires and/or nanowire arrays using the pulsed growth mode. In various embodiments, the truncated top facet diameter of each of the plurality of nanostructures 442 can be controlled to be smaller than that of each of the plurality of the nanostructure nuclei 440. In various embodiments, the top facet of each of the pluraliti' of nanostructures 442 can have an exemplary cross-sectional shape of, for example, a square, a polygon, a rectangle, an oval, and a circle.<br>

For example, there can be no threading dislocations observed with the GaN nanowires 145 and/or 445 shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 5, even if the threading dislocations can be observed in the GaN buffer layer 220 and/or 520 underlying the selective growth mask 135 and/or 435, since it is believed that these dislocations bend away from the nanowires and terminate at a surface beneath the growth mask. Furthermore, the defect-free GaN nanowires 610 can be grown on various substrates, such as, for example, sapphire, silicon carbide such as 6H-SiC, or silicon such as Si (111).<br>
[0075]	In various embodiments, the uniform and high-quality GaN nanowires<br>

The GaN substrate structure can be a continuous, epitaxial, and fully coalesced planar film. The "suitable heighf can be detenmined for each nanowire (e.g., GaN) and substrate (e.g., SiC or Si) combination and can be a height that allows a significant reduction in defect density in the upper coalesced GaN film (i.e., the GaN substrate structure). In addition, the "suitable height" can be a height that can maintain a mechanically-robust structure for the resulting semiconductor devices, for example, those shown in FIGS. 7A-7D. In various embodiments, because threading defects are not present in the plurality of GaN nanowires (e.g., 145 or 445), the coalescence of the GaN substrate structure (e.g., the substrate 712, 714,715, or 717) on top of these pluralities of nanowires can then occur and provide the GaN substrate structure containing an extremely low defect density', such as, for example, about 10' cm" or lower.<br>

[0078]	According to various smDodiments of the nanowire formation process,<br>
ths process stsps, (e.g., ths depositior, patterning and stching of the selective growth mask, the ssiective growth of nanowirs nucieL tne DUised growth of nanowires, and ths formation o" the exsmpjary GaN aubsirate struciurss) can be scaieabis to large substrate areas. They can also oe readiiy sxtendad to manufacturing requirements including automatic wafer handling and extended to larger size wafers for establishing efficacy of photonic crystals for light extractson from visible and near-UV LEDs.<br>
[0079]	FIGS, 8-12 depict exemplary embodiments for nanowire active aevices<br>
including nanowire LEDs and nanowire lasers, and their scalable processes for manufacturing, in various embodiments, the disclosed group Ill-N nanowires and nanowire arrays such as GaN nanowires and/or nanowire arrays can provide their active devices with unique properties. This is because each pufsed-grown GaN nanowire can have sidewalls of {1100} family and the normal to each of these side planes can be a nonpolar direction tor group Ui-N materials. High-quality quantum group lll-N wells such as quantum InGaN/GaN wells, quantum AIGaN/GaN wells or other quantum Ili-N wells, can therefore be fonmed on these side facets of each GaN nanowire.<br>
[00801	Forexample, the nanowire growth behavior can be changed<br>
significantly when other precursor gases such as trimethylaiuminum (Al) or trimethylindium (In) are added to the exemplary MOCVD gas phase during the puised growth mode. In this case, even a smali molecular fraction (e.g., about 1%) of Al or In added to the GaN nanowires and/or nanowire arrays can result in each GaN nanowire growing laterally with its cross-sectional dimensions (e.g., width or diameter) increasing over time. This lateral growth behavior can allow creation of B<br>
 <br>
core-shell heterostructurs, that is, cuantum welis including exempiaQf maieriais of sucr. as InQaN and AIGEN. afioys can be grovs?n on snc envelop each GaN nanowire core. As a result, the core-shall growth can create a core-shell nanowire/MQW active structure for light emitting devices,<br>
[0081]	In various embodiments, an additional third growth condition can be<br>
established to growths core-shell of the exemplary InGaN and AlGaN alloys, after<br>
the GaN nanowire has been grown using the disclosed two-phase growtn mode.<br>
This third growth mode can be a continuous growth similar to that used in the<br>
selective growth mode, for example, as shown at 310 in Fig. 3. In various other<br>
embodiments, a pulsed growth mode can be used for the third growth condition.<br>
[0082]	In various embodiments, the core-shell nanowire/MQW active<br>
structure can be used to provide high efficiency nanoscale optoelectronic devices,<br>
such as, for example, nanowire LEDs and/or nanowire lasers. For example, the<br>
resulting core-sheli nanowire/MQW active structure (I.e., having the MQW active<br>
sheli on sidewalts of each nanowire core) can be free from piezoelectric fields, and<br>
also free from the associated quantum-confined Stark effect (QC5E) because each<br>
nanowire core has non-polar sidewalls. The elimination of frie QCSE can increase<br>
the radiative recombination efficiency in the active region to improve the<br>
performance of the LEDs and lasers. Additionally, the absence of QCSE can allow<br>
wider quantum welis to be used, which can improve the overlap integral and cavity<br>
gain of the nanowire based lasers. A further exemplary efficiency benefit of using<br>
the core-shell nanowire/MQW active structure is that the active region area can be<br>
significant increased because of the unique core-shell structure.<br>

The electrical contacts can include conductive structures formed from metals such as titanium (Ti), aluminum (AI), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni) or gold (Au) in a number of multi-layered combinations such as AinTt/Pt/Au, Ni/Au, Ti/AI, Ti/Au, Ti/AI/Ti/Au, Ti/AI/Au, AI or Au using techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, [00100]        In FIG. 10A, the device 1000 can include a conductive structure 1040 formed on the surface of the device 900, i.e., on each surface of the dielectric<br>

By adjusting the thickness of the dielectric iayer 1010, the extent (e.g., thiciness or height) of the conductive structure 1040 (or p-electrode) formed on and along the sidewall of the shell structure 835 can be adjusted according to the desired application of nanowire active device, For example, a thick layer of the dieiectric 1010 can confine the conductive staicture 1040 (or p-electrode) to the top of the core-shell structured active devices, for example, for nanowire LEDs and/or nanowire lasers. Alternatively, an adjusted thin dielectric layer 1010 can allow the conductive structure 1040 (or p-electrode) to have a greater thickness or height (i.e., an increased extent), which can reduce the resistance of the active devices.

[00107]        At 1099, the resulting light of the nanowlre LED device 1000 in FIG. 10C can be extracted through the substrate 820, which can be transparent at green and blue \A/avelengths. In various embodiments, a more diffuse light output can occur on the top side of the device 1000 (not shown) since the nanowirs LED device 1000 can be small enough for sufficient diffraction. This diffuse light output can be advantageous in some solid-state lighting applications.<br>
[00108]        In this manner, the disclosed nanowire LED device 1000 can provide unique properties as compared with traditional LED devices. First, it can have a higher brightness because the core-shell grown active region area {i.e., the IVIQW active shell area) can be increased, for example, by a factor of approximately 10 times compared to a conventional planar LED structure. Second, the light extraction can be improved to increase the output efficiency of the LED. This is because the LED device's geometry can make the most of the active region area oriented norma! to the wafer surface, i.e., the substrate surface. The confinement regions on either side of the MQW active region can tend to guide the LED light in the vertical direction. Third, because of the high precision of the position and diameter of each of the plurality of nanowires and/or nanowire arrays, the resulting arrays of the LED devices 1000 can also be configured as a photonic-crystal, which can further<br>
 <br>
improve the iight output coupiing efficiency. Fourth, the nanowJre LED resisrancs can be significantly decreased because of the increase of the eisctricEi cor-tact srsE, for example, tie contact area of ins p-eiectrode 104£. Finally, sine© tne LED aevice 1000 can provide a specified light power with higner brightness, more devices can bs processed on a given wafer, which can decrease tne cost of production and also increase the manufacturing efficiency. For exampie, to allow for metai contacis, the LED device 1000 can include a pitch spacing (i.e., a ceraer-to-csnter spacing between any two adjacent nanowire devices) of, for example, about 100 jann. A 4-inch wafer can then include a number of nanowire LED devices 1000, for example, about 0.78 million devices or more, which can be manufactured simultaneously, in various embodiments, the pitch spacing can be reduced further to allow a single 4-inch wafer to contain, for example, more than one million LED devices 1000. [00109]        FIGS. 11-12 depict exemplary nanowire laser devices using the core-shell grown nanowire/MQW active stmcture shown in FIGS. 8-10 in accordance with the present teachings, Because the sidewal! facets of the nanowires and/or nanowire arrays are exact {1100} facets with a flatness on the scale of an atomic monolayer, high quality IWQW active regions for laser devices can be formed on these superior fiat "sidewali substrates." in addition, the vertical orientation of the sidewail facets, and the uniform periodicity and length of tlie nanowires can provide a high-throughput method of etching or cleaving facets to form an optical cavity. The uniform periodicity can allow a photonic crystal optical cavity to be established sfraightforwardly.<br>
[001101        As shown in FIG. 11, the nanowire laser device 1100 can be fabricated from the processes described in FIGS. 8-10 using the core-sheli grown nanowire/MQW active structure as laser active structure. The nanowire laser device<br>
 <br>
1100 can include a poiished shell structure 1135, a polisned p-etectrode 1145, and a passivation iayer 1195, which can be formed on each surtace of the polisnsd snsi strucrurs ;".35 and the polished o-elecirode 1 'f45 K* cap the aser sctive struciure. [001111        The polished shell staicturr 1135 sns tne poiishad p-eiectrodfc 1145 can D3 formed by polishing (i.e., removing) on the top end (with respect to the substrate 810 as the bottom end) of the core-shell nanowire/WIQW active structure (i.e., laser active structure) such as tiiat shown in FtG. IOC: Various polishing processes, for example, a chemtcal-mechamcal polishing, can be used using the etched dielectric 1015 as a mechanical support.<br>
[00112]        The polishing step can be used to polish a number of laser facets at the same time without diminishing the manufacturabillty of the nanowine laser devices 1100, For example, a number of nanowire laser devices 1100 such as about 0.78 million or more, can be fomied on a 4-inch wafer for a high manufacturing efficiency. In various embodiments, the pitch spacing can be reduced further to allow a single 4-inch wafer to contain, for example, more than one million laser devices 1100.<br>
[00113]        In various embodiments, the extent (e.g., thickness or height) of the polished p- electrode 1145 fomried along the sidewalls of the polished shell structure 1135 can be adjusted by adjusting thickness of the underlying etched dielectric 1015 for optimum perfonnance of the laser device 1100. In various embodiments, the thickness of the polished p-eiectrode 1145 along the sidewall of the polished shell structure 1135 shown in FIG. 11 can range from about 1 p.m to about 5 m, when the overall height is about 10 fim.<br>
[00114]        The passivation layer 1195 can be formed at the polished top end of each laser active structure, i.e., on each surface of the polished p-slectrode 1145<br>
 <br>
and the poirshed shell structure 1135. The passivation iaysr 1125 can be ccnfigursd to avoid undue non-radiative rscombination orjunotion isakage of the nsnolrs IRBST device HOC, in various embodiments, tne passivatiori layer 1195 can oe to-msd of, for example, any dielectno material known to one of ordinar\/ skill in the an with a thickness of about 10 to about 10D nm.<br>
[001151        In some embodiments, the composjtion and reiractivs index of the materials used for tine polished shell structure 1135 surrounding the nanowire cavity (i.e., the nanowire core 830) can affect the optical lasing process at 119B. For example, when the nanowires have an exemplary diameter of about 200 nm, some of the optical lasing mode can exist outside the cavity. The laser can therefore be more sensitive to the composition and refractive Index of the materials surrounding the cavity, that Is, materials used for each layer of the polished shell structure 1135. [001161        In other embodiments, because there is no physical lower facet on the laser optical cavity (i.e., the nanowire core 830), there can be a change of effective refractive index in the vicinity' of the selective growth mask 1025. This index change can in fact be helped (I.e., made larger) by the fact that some of the optical iasing mode can exist outside the cavity. In an exemplary embodiment, the nanowire laser device 11 GO (see Fig. 11) can be optically tuned by adjusting the thickness of the selective contact mask 1025 for a maximum reflectivity. For example, the optical thickness of the selective contact mask 1025 for the laser device 1100 can be in a range of about 220 nm to about 230 nm when the device is emitting blue light at 450 nm.<br>
[00117]        FIG. 12 depicts another exemplary laser device 1200, in which a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror stack 1220 can be disposed between the layers of the substrate 810 and the selective growth masfc 1025, as opposed to the<br>
 <br>
doped buffer layer 820 being disposed between these two iaysrs of the laser device 1100 shown in Fit. 11.<br>

[00119]        In various embodiments, ali the nanowire active devices shown in FIGS. 10-12 can provide a iow device resistance because more resistive p-eiectrodes {e.g., the p-electrode 1045 and/or 1145) of the heterostructure can be located at the larger-area, which is outer periphery of each core-shell nanowire/MQW active structure. For example, for the LED device 1000 (shown In FIG. 10), the p-electrode 1045 can be patterned to completely cover the top of the device 1000 to further decrease the device resistance.<br>
[00120]        Although a single nanowire is depicted In FIGS. B-12 for the purpose of description, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the core-shell growth processes on each nanowire of the plurality of nanowires and/or nanowire arrays (e.g., shown In FIGS. 1-6) for nanoscale active devices can be simultaneously conducted in a large area (e.g., a whole wafer).<br>
