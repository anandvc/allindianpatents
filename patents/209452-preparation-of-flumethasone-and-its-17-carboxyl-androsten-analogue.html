				<td>PREPARATION OF FLUMETHASONE AND ITS 17-CARBOXYL ANDROSTEN ANALOGUE<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparing flumethasone, flumethasone 21-acetate and its 17-carboxyl androsten analogue, and to certain starting materials for the process.<br>
Flumethasone, 6a,9a-difluoro-16a-methylprednisolone was described for the first time in 1962. Although this corticosteroid has an enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, it has not been widely used clinically. At the present time, its economical preparation on an industrial scale is ever more important because it is also an excellent starting material for the production of new difluoro-17-carboxyl androstenes, which are becoming increasingly important from a clinical point of view.<br>
Flumethasone and its production are the subject of a number of patents including US 3,499,016 (1962) and British Patent 902,292 (1970). The new synthetic techniques developed since 1970 naturally permit a more efficient production of flumethasone with considerably increased yields compared to those obtained with the initial patents.<br>
We have now devised a new process for the preparation of flumethasone as well as to the preparation of 6a,9a-difluoro~llß,17a-dihydroxy-16a-methyl-17ß-carboxy-androsta-l,4-diene-3-one which is also called "hydroxyacid", an excellent starting material for the production of fluticasone and other new anti-inflammatory compounds of the androsta-l,4-diene series. The "hydroxyacid" was first described and claimed in US 3,636,010 (priority 1968).<br>
European Patent 0 610 138 131 (1994) describes a synthetic route for the preparation of the so called "hydroxyacid". However, the present invention represents considerable unexpected advantages in relation to this prior process patent, namely:<br>
the reaction sequence is reduced by one reaction step and by the elimination of the desolvatation step of 6a,9a-difluoro-11ß,17a-dihydroxy 16a-methyl 17ß-methoxycarbonyl androsta-l,4-diene-3-one, an additional production step,<br>
the present process avoids the use of a highly toxic reagent, dimethyl sulphate,<br>
permits the simultaneous deacetylation and degradative oxidation of the pregnane side chain forming directly the equivalent androstan derivative,<br>
increased yield of the hydroxyacid with excellent purity.<br>
Whilst all the reaction steps of the present invention are realised in the pregnane series excepting the last one thus permitting an efficient preparation of flumethasone, the reaction sequence of EP0610138131 transforms the common starting material of both processes as from the first step into the androstane series.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing flumethasone (6a ,9a-difluoro-11ß, 17a ,21 -trihydroxy-16a-methyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione), fulmethasone 21-acetate or its 17-carboxyl androsten analogue of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which process comprises<br>
(a)      reacting a compound of formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with benzoyl chloride to form a 3-enolic ester of the formula (IIIa):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
b)       reacting the enol benzoate (III a) with an electrophilic fluorination agent to introduce fluorine in the 6a- position to form a compound of formula (IIIb):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
 (c)      deprotecting the compound (IIIb) at C3 to form a compound of formula (IV):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fluorinating  the  9,11-epoxy group  of compound IV by reacting it with<br>
hydrofluoric acid to yield flumethasone 21-acetate; and<br>
(d)	optionally hydrolysing the flumethasone 21-acetate, in the presence or absence<br>
of an oxidation agent, to yield compound (I) or flumethasone, respectively.<br>
claim 1<br>
The invention also provides compounds of the formula (V):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein X is hydrogen or fluorine.<br>
In step (d) of the process, the flumethasone 21-acetate formed has the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
ie 6a,9a-difluoro-llß,17a,21-trihydroxy-16a-methyl-pregna-l,4-diene-3,20-dion e,21-acetate. If this compound is hydrolysed, preferably with methanolic potassium hydroxide, the flumethasone free alcohol is formed.<br>
Alternatively, if the flumethasone acetate is hydrolysed, preferably with methanolic potassium hydroxide, and then oxidised, preferably with hydrogen peroxide solution, the so called "hydroxyacid" is obtained, of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The present invention permits the direct transformation of flumethasone acetate into compound I.<br><br>
The two new compounds III a) and III b) are depicted as a general formula (V) in claim 8.<br>
The compound I can also be obtained as described in US Patent 3,636,010 by oxidizing flumethasone free alcohol.<br>
The starting material of the present process is commercially available and widely used in the preparation of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and icomethasone.<br>
In order to introduce fluorine in the C6 position by electrophilic fluorination, it is necessary to activate first the C6 position. For that purpose, the 3-keto group is enolised by carboxylic acid chloride, forming an enolic ester residue of the formula -COR in which R is an aryl or aralkyl group. The preferred compound for the enolisation is benzoyl chloride, yielding the compound of formula III a) in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as pyridine. The preferred solvent is N,N'dimethylacetamide and the reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of 80 to 85°C, yielding the ? 3,5 enol benzoate. Thereafter, the compound III a) is reacted with an electrophilic fluorination agent to yield the corresponding 6 fluoro derivative. The preferred fluorination agent is the l-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-l,4-diazoniabicyclo [2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate), Selectfluor®. So as to realise the fluorination at C6, the preferred solvent is acetonitrile in presence of water at a preferred temperature of -5°C ± 2°C. After the C6 fluorination, the 3 enolic ester can be easily transformed into the system of 3-keto-l,4-diene yielding the compound IV. The elimination of the enolic ester is preferably effected by an aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite and ammonia.<br>
In the next step, a 9,11-epoxy group of compound IV is reacted with a concentrated aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid or with a solution of hydrogen fluoride in N,N'dimethylformamide by per se known processes at a temperature below 25°C. When compound IV is practically completely reacted, the reaction mixture is poured into a mixture of ice and ammonia sufficient to neutralise the hydrofluoric acid and precipitate simultaneously the flumethasone 21-acetate with a high yield and purity. The product obtained can be recrystallized for instance from methanol. The 21-acetate obtained can be subsequently hydrolyzed by any of the known processes yielding<br>
flumethasone free alcohol. One of the preferred processes is effected in degassed methanolic potassium hydroxide at a temperature between -15°C and -5°C. The end of the reaction is ascertained by HPLC after one hour and it is considered complete when the amount of starting compound is less than 1 %.<br>
In order to carry out the degradative oxidation, according to prior art, flumethasone is suspended in tetrahydrofuran and a solution of the oxidation agent is added dropwise. The substrate first starts to dissolve followed by precipitation. The oxidation is performed preferably at 20°C employing, for example, periodic acid. After one hour of stirring, completion of the reaction is controlled by HPLC. Once the amount of non reacted flumethasone is less than to 0.3%, the reaction is considered complete. Subsequently, the reaction mixture containing compound I is precipitated by adding to an aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite and ice.<br>
According to the present invention, flumethasone 21-acetate can be simultaneously deacetylated and oxidised by methanolic potassium hydroxide and aqueous hydrogen peroxide yielding, after completion of the reaction, the desired hydroxyacid, compound 1, by acidifying the reaction mixture with diluted hydrochloric acid to pH 2. This reaction is performed at 10°C, ± 2°C with agitation until the reaction is complete.<br>
The cumulative stoichiometric yield of the process described in EP 0610138 Bl so as to obtain unrecrystallized compound I is 48.9% as from 9,llß-epoxy-17a,21-dihydroxy-pregna-l,4-diene-3,20-dione, whilst according to the present process the cumulative stoichiometric yield obtained is 62.4%, as per Examples 1 b), 2 and 4, as from the 21-acetate of the above starting material. So as to obtain a valid comparison of yields, the starting material of EP 0610138B1 has been first acetylated with a yield of 110% w/w and the cumulative stoichiometric yield was calculated on basis of this value and of Examples 1 b), 2 and 4, resulting in 61.7%.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention without limiting its scope. EXAMPLE I<br>
9,11ß-epoxy-6a-fluor-17a,21 -dihydroxy-16a-methyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione,   21-<br>
acetate (Formula IV)<br>
a) One dissolves in an inert atmosphere 50 g of 9,llß-epoxy-17a,21-dihydroxy-16a-methyl pregna-l,4-diene-3,20-dione, 21-acetate in 25ml of dimethylacetamide (DMA). One adds 65 ml of pyridine and heats the reaction mixture is heated with stirring to between 80°C and 85°C. Subsequently one adds 33 ml of benzoyl chloride, protected from light, and continues to stir during two to three hours at this temperature and cools it down to 40°c when the reaction is completed. Subsequently, one adds 75 ml of methanol and continues stirring at 40°C for another 30 minutes followed by cooling down the reaction mixture to 20-25°C. Subsequently, one adds the reaction mixture to 1,000 ml of water containing 57.5 ml of hydrochloric acid and 100 ml of dichloromethane. After the extraction, one separates the phases and the aqueous phase is again extracted by an additional 100 ml of dichloromethane. Subsequently, the organic phase is washed with water and with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The dichloromethane solution thus obtained is evaporated in vacuum to dryness yielding an oil, 3-benzoyloxy-9,11ß-epoxy-17,21-dihydroxy-16a-methyl-pregna l,3;5-triene-20-one 21-acetate (Formula III a), which is taken up by 150 ml of acetonitrile cooled down to between -5°C and 0°C. Subsequently, one adds the solution of enolbenzoate to a suspension of 44.5 g of l-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-l,4diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) Selectfluor®, in 175 ml of acetonitrile containing 5 ml of water.<br>

The pH is then adjusted to between 7 and 7.5, the solution is stirred for 30 minutes, and the precipitate is filtered and washed. Subsequently, the product thus obtained is washed by suspending it in 150ml of methanol with stirring. After stirring for 30 minutes, it is filtered and dried at a temperature between 40°-45°C, yielding 46 g of 9,llß-epoxy-6a-fluoro-17a,21-dihydroxy-l,4diene-3,20-dione,21 -acetate with a purity of 91.6%.<br>
