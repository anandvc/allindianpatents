SUBSTITUTED 2-(DIAZA-BICYCLO-ALKYL)-PYRIMIDONE<br>
DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3b.<br>
Background Art<br>
GSK3P (glycogen synthase kinase 3b) is a proline directed serine, threonine kinase that plays an important role in the control of metabolism, differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. It was later recognized that GSK3p was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease and in several taupathies. Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK3P results in a loss of its kinase activity, and it has been hypothesized that this inhibition may mediate some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation by GSK3(3 of p-catenin, a protein involved in cell survival, results in its degradation by an ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3b activity may result in neurotrophic activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK3b enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal survival, through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition of the expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax. Recent studies have demonstrated that b-amyloid increases the GSK3P activity and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as the neurotoxic effects of b-amyloid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a GSK3P antisense mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that GSK3p may be the link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease: abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein hyperphosphorylation.<br>
Although tau hyperphosphorylation results in a destabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton, the pathological consequences of abnormal GSK3P activity are,<br>
most likely, not only due to a pathological phosphorylation of tau protein because, as mentioned above, an excessive activity of this kinase may affect survival through the modulation of the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors. Moreover, it has been shown that p-amyloid-induced increase in GSK3p activity results in the phosphorylation and, hence the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a pivotal enzyme in energy production and acetylcholine synthesis.<br>
Altogether these experimental observations indicate that GSK3P may find application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. These include, in a non-limiting manner, Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition GSK3p may find application in the treatment of other diseases such as: Non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II) and obesity; manic depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-induced tumors.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3P activity may result in neurotrophic activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK3p, enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal survival, through the induction of survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition of the expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.

As a further object, the present invention concerns also methods for preparing the 2-(diaza-bicyclo-alkyl)-pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
These compounds can be prepared, for example, according to methods explained below.<br>
Preparation method<br>
2-(Diaza-bicyclo-alkyl)-pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I), wherein R2 is as defined previously but not a hydrogen, may be prepared according to the method described in the scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R3, R4 and n are the same as<br>
those already described for compound of formula (I)).<br>
Following this method, the pyrimidinone derivative represented by the above formula (II), wherein R1, R3, R4 and n are as defined for compound of formula (I), is allowed to react, according to well known method in the art, with a compound of formula (III), wherein R2 is as defined for compound of formula (I) but not a hydrogen. For example the reaction may be carried out in a presence of a base such as alkoxide, amine or carbonate bases such as sodium tert-butoxide, triethylamine or cesium carbonate, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide and the like to give compound of formula (I).<br>
More particularly, when R2 is an aryl group or a heteroaryl group such as defined for compound of formula (I), the reaction may be carried out according to Buchwald et al's method by a palladium-catalyzed amination (J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 6066-6068; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 118, 7217-7218). That is, the reaction is carried out in a presence of alkoxide, amine or carbonate bases, for example sodium tert-butoxide, triethylamine or cesium carbonate, and a palladium catalyst such as for example palladium(ll) acetate with a ligand such as (R)-(+)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, tetraglyme or polyethylene glycol, at a suitable temperature ranging from 25° to 130 °C under inert atmosphere.<br>
Alternatively, 2-(diaza-bicyclo-alkyl)-pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I), wherein R2 is as defined previously for compound of formula (I), may be prepared according to scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R2, R3, R4 and n are the same as already described for compound of formula (I)).<br>
Following this method, compound of formula (XI), wherein R1, R3 and R4 are as defined for compound of formula (I) and L represents a leaving group such as for example a chlorine or bromine atom, is allowed to react with a compound of formula (X) wherein n and R2 are as defined for compound of formula (I). The reaction may be carried out in a presence of a base such as for example sodium hydride or triethylamine in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from 20° to 60°C.<br>
The compound of formula (II) may be prepared according to the method defined in scheme 3.<br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R3, R4 and n are the same as already described for compound of formula (I)).<br>
According to this method, the 3-ketoester of formula (IV), wherein R1 and R3 are as defined for compound formula (I) and R is an alkyl group such as for example a methyl or ethyl group, is allowed to react with N-alkylthiourea of formula (V) wherein R4 is as defined for compound of formula (I). The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene,<br>
in a alcoholic solvent such as ethanol, at a suitable temperature ranging from 25° to 140°C under ordinary air to give the thiopyrimidone derivative of formula (VI). The thiopyrimidone derivative of formula (VI) is allowed to react with phosphorus oxychloride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, at a suitable temperature ranging from 0° to 55°C under argon atmosphere to give the 2-chloropyrimidone derivative of formula (VII). This latter of formula (VII) is then reacted with a compound of formula (VlII), wherein Pg is a protecting group such as for example a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, at a suitable temperature ranging from 0° to 25°C, to give compound of formula (IX). The compound of formula (IX) is then deprotected according to well known method in the art such as for example when the protecting group is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane at room temperature to give the aforementioned formula (II).<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (II) wherein R1 represents a halogen atom such as a bromine atom or a chlorine atom, may be obtained by halogenation of a compound of formula (II) wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom. The reaction may be carried out in an acidic medium such as acetic acid or propionic acid, in presence of bromosuccinimide or chlorosuccinimide, or bromine.<br>
In addition, compounds of formula (II), wherein R1 represents a fluorine atom, may be obtained by analogy to the method described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol.30, N°45,pp 6113-6116,1989.<br>
Compounds of formula (III), (IV), (V), (VIII), (XI) and (X) are commercially available or may be synthesized according to well-known methods to one skilled in the art.<br>
For example compounds of formula (IV), wherein R3 and R1 are as defined for compound of formula (I) and R is an alkyl group such as a methyl or an ethyl, can be prepared by reacting a pyrimidine-carboxylic acid or pyridine-carboxylic acid, optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or an halogen, with the corresponding malonic acid monoester. The reaction can be carried out using methods well known to one skilled in the art, such as for example in presence of a coupling agent such as 1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole in a solvent such.as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature ranging from 20° to 70°C.<br>
For example compounds of formula (VIII) with the absolute configuration (1R) can be prepared according to EP-400661.<br>
As a further object,-the present invention concerns also the compound of formula (II) as intermediate for preparing compounds of formula (I).<br>
In the above reactions, protection or deprotection of a functional group may sometimes be necessary. A suitable protecting group Pg can be chosen depending on the type of the functional group, and a method described in the literature may be applied. Examples of protecting groups, of protection and deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in Organic Synthesis Greene et al., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
