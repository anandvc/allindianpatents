TERMS AND DEFINITIONS USED<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all the substituents are independent of one another. If foi example there are a plurality of C-i-e-alkyl groups as substituents in one group, in the case of three substituents C-i-e-alkyl, one may represent methyl, one n-propyl and one te/t-butyl.<br>
Within the scope of this application, in the definition of possible substituents, these may also be represented in the form of a structural formula. An asterisk (*) in the structural formula of the substituent is to be understood as being the linking point to the rest of the molecule. Moreover, the atom of the substituent which follows the linking point is referred to as the atom in position number 1. Thus for example the groups N-piperidinyl (I), 4-piperidinyl (II), 2-tolyl (III), 3-tolyl (IV) and 4-tolyl (V) are shown as follows:<br>
If there is no asterisk (*) in the structural formula of the substituent, each hydrogen atom may be removed from the substitutent and the valency thus freed may act as a binding site to the rest of a molecule. Thus for example VI may represent 2-tolyl, 3-tolyl, 4-tolyl and benzyl.<br>
