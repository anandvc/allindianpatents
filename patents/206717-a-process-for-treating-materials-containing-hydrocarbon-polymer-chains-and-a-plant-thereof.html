"A PROCESS FOR TREATING MATERIAL CONTAINING HYDROCARBON POLYMER   CHAINS AND A PLANT THEREOF"<br>
Technologicall field<br>
The present invention relates to the disposal of solid materials by incineration, and in<br>
particular the disposal of solid materials which generate highly pollutant gases when they<br>
burn.<br>
Background art<br>
This type of material is very wide-ranging and comprises a large variety of synthetic products, plastic materials, and others.<br>
This type of material is usually disposed of by incinerators, which involve a considerable energy cost and, notwithstanding gas purification,present drawbacks concerning the production of gaseous dioxins and other pollutant gases.<br>
In addition to an understandable plant complication, the known processes involve oxidizing the treated material, so depleting its calorific value and rendering it very deficient as a fuel.<br>
It is immediately evident that this considerably affects the economy of the process. US 5157176 discloses a process for recycling used automobile rubber tires in which small pieces of rubber tires are progressively fed into a vertical reactor of the counter-flow type in which the material progressively descends through the reactor with process gases passing upward through the downwardly descending material to decompose and volatilise the rubber material.<br><br>
2<br>
At the lower portion of the vessel, oxygen bearing gas is injected into the reactor to burn<br>
a portion of the rubber carbon to generate hot combustion gases that pyrolitically<br>
decompose the rubber pieces and volatilise such material<br>
The result of the process disclosed in the US'176 is condensed oil the heavy fraction of<br>
which is used as plasticizing agent in rubber compound.<br>
The condensed product is not suitable to be used as a fuel because of the poor calorific<br>
value.<br>
US 4284616 discloses a process for recovering carbon black, oil and fuel gas from used<br>
tires: The process is based on the pyrolisation at slight subatmosferic pressure of tire<br>
fragments.	<br>
The object of this patent is to dispose of materials consisting in particular of plastic         <br>
materials of synthetic origin by the destruction or depolymerization of their hydrocarbon<br>
chains, with simultaneous recovery of the resultant liquid condensate of the process,<br>
which has high energy power.	<br>
A last but not less important object of the invention is to implement cleaning of the off-gases such as to satisfy the current severe ecological regulations.<br>
Disclosure of the invention	<br>
These objects of the invention are attained by the process and plant defined in the claims.<br>
The process of the invention represents the combination of two mutually interacting	<br>
steps, and takes place under vacuum at low temperature in the presence of an oxidizing<br>
agent such as oxygen or ozone.<br>
The material to be treated is preferably comminuted into pieces of uniform dimensions,<br>
of the order of 50 mm to 300 mm, and then fed into a vessel acting as a reactor.<br>
The quantity of material, or charge, fed into the vessel preferably occupies a quarter of its<br>
capacity, below which a normal burner, of the type used in common boilers, opens into<br>
the vessel.<br>
The system is initiated by flame triggering with said burner.<br>
The time required for triggering by the flame is of the order of one minute.<br>
When triggering has occurred, the entire vessel or reactor is subjected to forced suction<br>
by a fan by which it is emptied of its initial reaction gas, the suction fan after a short<br><br>
3<br>
period then reducing the pressure within the vessel or reactor to prevent undesirable<br>
combustion reactions.<br>
The absolute pressure within the reactor is stabilized at around 250 mm Hg to prevent<br>
undesirable combustion reactions and promote a reaction similar to thermal cracking.<br>
The lack of air within the reactor considerably slows down the combustion process,<br>
which was initially accompanied by flame, to then become increasingly more similar to<br>
thermal cracking.<br>
After this initiation step, with the reaction stabilized, normal operation commences,<br>
during which an oxidizing agent, generally oxygen, is fed into the reaction chamber in a<br>
quantity from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% of the material to be treated.<br>
Care must be taken to feed the oxidizing agent, facilitating the process of molecular<br>
breakdown, at a rate which does not result in the creation of centres of combustion with<br>
triggering of flame.<br>
During the entire reaction, the feed of oxidizing agent is constantly balanced with the<br>
quantity of reaction gas generated by the molecular splitting of the polymer chains, in<br>
order to favour the entire process to the maximum extent.<br>
The molecular splitting of the polymer chains is aimed at restoring certain chemical<br>
parameters which preceded the formation of polymer chains, in the absence of<br>
combustion and with the intention of obtaining the greatest possible gas quantity as the<br>
final result of the reaction.<br>
The reaction gases obtained in this manner are fed to a condenser which converts them<br>
into liquid form (phase).<br>
The process comprises purifying the obtained liquid phase of undesirable substances and<br>
by-products, principally the sulphur component if present in the starting materials.<br>
Another undesirable component is the chlorine component which, if present on entry, is<br>
eliminated by circulation through a suitable removal circuit followed by neutralization by<br>
treatment with calcium carbonate CaCO3 or sodium bicarbonate 2NaHCO3.<br>
The liquid cleaned of the undesirable components is fed to certain vessels performing the<br>
double task of storage and further purification of the product by gravity.<br>
The entire system requires a suitable vent to prevent pressurization during the cycle.<br>
In this manner there is extracted from most of the polymerized HYDROCARBON chains<br><br>
4<br>
a quantity of gas and/or liquid of high calorific value and at low depolymerization cost.<br>
All those parts which cannot be transformed are discharged at the end of the cycle and are<br>
classed as process residues.<br>
Said residues are not necessarily unsuitable for other possible uses, but are unsuitable for<br>
adequate transformation with the present process.<br>
The nature of the residues in question means that they may be able to [be reused by other<br>
techniques of destructive type such as combustion, or of selective type based on<br>
individual polymer chains, with consequent processing to obtain products suitable for<br>
moulding or extrusion.<br>
If required by local regulations, the process can include cleaning of the off-gases and<br>
emissions by known means.<br>
The aforedescribed process is implemented in a plant illustrated schematically in Figure<br>
1, the description of which will include further process parameters.<br>
Said plant comprises a vessel or reactor 1 provided with a sealed closure hatch 2 through<br>
which the material to be treated is loaded with the aid of a conveyor 3. The material<br>
occupies about a quarter of the volume of the reactor 1, to the base of which there is<br>
applied a normal fuel oil burner 4 for the purpose of triggering the reaction.<br>
Into a reactor of inner diameter 1500 mm and internal height of 4500 mm, material is<br>
loaded to a volume equal to about a quarter of the reactor volume.<br>
At the base of the reactor 1 there is shown a usual system 5 for discharging the spent<br>
product.<br>
One or more conduits 6 open into the base of the reactor 1 below the material to be<br>
treated, they originating from an evaporator 7 fed by the vessel 8 containing oxygen or<br>
ozone, to be fed into the material.<br>
The conduit 6 comprises known means 9 for metering the oxygen or ozone.<br>
Valves 10 for the feed of air in addition to or as an alternative to the oxygen feed can be<br>
provided in the upper part of the reactor.<br>
The oxygen fed during the cycle is from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% of the material to be treated, and<br>
is preferably of the order of 1 wt%.<br>
From close to the top of the reactor there extends a gas collection conduit 11 which, by<br>
means of a fan 12 positioned upstream of the condenser, leads the gases to a condenser<br><br>
13 in which they are reduced to the liquid phase.<br>
Besides emptying the reactor of the off-gases generated during the triggering stage of the<br>
process, the action of the fan reduces the absolute pressure within the reactor to close to<br>
250 mm Hg during normal operation.<br>
The temperature at which depolymerization occurs, with simultaneous infeed of oxygen,<br>
is of the order of 200°C.<br>
The condenser 13 is of the water-cooled type and reduces the temperature to between<br>
about 45°C and 50°C.<br>
Downstream of the condenser 13 there are provided in series a separator 14 for separating<br>
the sulphur, and a dechlorination device 15, downstream of which the liquid is stored in a<br>
tank 16 provided with means 17 to prevent its pressurization.<br>
The separator 14 is a vessel with a grid which retains the sulphur present in the<br>
condensate in the form of paste or pulp.<br>
The dechlorination device is a usual device operating with calcium carbonate CaCO3 or<br>
sodium bicarbonate 2NaHCO3, within which the chlorine is collected in the form of<br>
chloride salts.<br>
The liquid collected in the tank has the appearance of a liquid of greater or lesser<br>
viscosity depending on the material treated, and has a calorific value of between 3,000<br>
and 10,000 kCal/kg.<br>
The ratio of the liquid obtained to the material treated is of the order of about 0.8 litres<br>
per kilogram.<br>
The treatment of a load of material based on hydrocarbon chains requires about one hour,<br>
and leaves a solid residue equal to about 10% of the material fed into the reactor.<br>
The process is interrupted when a substantial reduction in the liquid produced is noted,<br>
due partly to depletion of the material but mainly to the fact that the quantity of material<br>
composed of process residues remaining in the reactor is too small.<br>
The residual material is withdrawn from the reactor and set aside until, after about ten<br>
cycles, a quantity of residual material sufficient to form a new load has accumulated.<br>
It is not worth while to repeat the treatment of the residual material more than once.<br>
The process has been described as a batch process, but it can also be implemented as a<br>
continuous process in a reactor provided with convenient sealed means for loading the<br>
material.<br><br>
