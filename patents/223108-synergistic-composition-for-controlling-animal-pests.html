				<td>The present invention relates to synergistic composition for controlling animal pests.<br>
It is already known that spinosyns can be used for controlling insects (WO 97/00265, WO 93/09126, WO 94/20518, US-5 362 634, US-5 202 242, US-5 670 364, US-5 227 295, see also DowElanco trade magazine Down to Earth, Vol. 52, No. 1, 1997).<br>
However, spinosyns on their own do not always exhibit satisfactory insecticidal activity.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that agonists and antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be used for controlling insects.<br>
It has now been found that mixtures of spinosyns and at least one agonist or antagonist of acetylcholine receptors of the formula (III) are synergistically effective and suitable for controlling animal pests. Owing to this synergism, it is possible to employ considerably lower amounts of active compounds, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br>
The spinosyns are known compounds. The fermentation product (A 83543) described in US 5 362 634 comprises various compounds which are referred to as spinosyn A, B, C etc. (cf. WO 97/00265, WO 93/09126 and WO 94/20518). The spinosyns can be represented by the formulae (I) and (II) below.<br><br>
 (Table Remove) <br>
R2, R3 and R4 independently of one another each represent Ci-C4-alkyl, C]-C4-halogenoalkyl, C]-C4-alkylcarbonyl or protected hydroxyl,<br>
R5	represents hydrogen, C alkyl, Cj-C4-alkylamino or represents<br><br>
alkylhydroxylamino of the formula -N-OR<br>
R10<br>
O<br>
in which<br><br>
R'O and Rl' independently of one another each represent hydrogen, C | -C4-alkyl or C j -C5-alkylcarbonyl,<br>
R.6	represents hydrogen or methyl,<br>
independently of one another each represent C]-C4-alk.yl, C-C4-halogenoalkyl or C -C4-alkylcarbonyl or represent protected amino and<br>
R9	represents methyl or ethyl<br>
are also known (WO 97/00 265).<br>
The compounds disclosed in WO 97/00 265 are expressly incorporated into the present application by way of reference.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention comprise at least one spinosyn of the formula (I), (la) or (II).<br>
Preference is given to synergistic mixtures with at least one spinosyn of the formula (I) or (II).<br><br>
Particular preference is given to synergistic mixtures which comprise a mixture of spinosyn A and spinosyn D, where the ratio of spinosyn A to spinosyn D is generally between approximately 80:20 and approximately 98:2, and where preference is given to a value of approximately 85:15.<br>
Very particular preference is given to using Spinosad (see, for example, DowElanco trade magazine Down to Earth, vol. 52, No. 1, 1997 and literature cited therein) which essentially consists of a mixture of spinosyn A and spinosyn D in a ratio of approximately 85:15.<br>
Use is made, in particular, of the fermentation product A 83543 known from US-5 362 634 which comprises approximately 85 to 90% of spinosyn A, approximately 10 to 15% of spinosyn D and smaller amounts of the spinosyns B, C, E, F, (i, II and J.<br>
It is also possible to use the acid addition salts described therein.<br>
The agonists and antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are known compounds which are known from the following publications:<br>

or else mixtures of more than one of the abovementioned fungicides.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercial formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The mixtures of active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, active-cornpound-impregnated natural and synthetic materials, very fine encapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, furthermore in formulations with smokes, such as fumigating cartridges, fumigating cans, fumigating coils and the like, and also ULV cold fogging and warm mist formulations.<br>
These formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, pressurized liquefied gases and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispcrsants, and/or foam-forming agents. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid<br><br>
solvents are essentially: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water; by liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are meant liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellant, such as halogenated hydrocarbons and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide; suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica- alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifiers and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersing agents are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxy-methy[cellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Further additives may be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo<br>
dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound mixture, preferably between 0.5 and 90 per cent by weight of active compound mixture.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention can be applied via the soil. The mixtures according to the invention can be applied via the leaf.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention can be employed particularly advantageously for seed dressing.<br>
Furthermore, the mixtures according to the invention can preferably be applied via the soil.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to apply the mixtures according to the invention via an irrigation system, for example via the water for irrigation.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that it is also possible to apply the active components of the mixtures according to the invention separately, for example, to apply the spinosyn(s), advantageously in the form of a suitable formulation, onto the soil, and to use the compound or the compounds of the formula (III), advantageously in the form of a suitable formulation, via the leaf, or vice versa.<br>
Use examples Example 1 Activity of folia-insecticidal formulations against sucking pests<br>
The insectieidal activity was examined using the critical concentration test. From each of the test preparations, an aqueous dilution series is made by diluting the individual concentrations by the factor 5.<br>
To determine any synergistic activity, weakly active concentrations of chloro-nicotinyl compounds are combined with various active compound concentrations of Tracer (Spinosad).<br>
The test plants used are cabbage plants at the one-leaf stage which are infested by Myzus persicae (green peach aphid). The shoots or leaves with the aphids are dipped for approximately 3 seconds into the respective liquors. The experiments are subsequently placed in a greenhouse at 21°C and 65% relative atmospheric humidity.<br>
Evaluation for mortality is carried out after 2 and 7 days.<br>

Example 2 Critical concentration test/root-systemic action<br>
Test insect:	Aphis fabae<br>
Solvent:	4 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with a stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The active compound preparation is mixed intimately with soil. The concentration of the active compound in the preparation is of virtually no importance, only the amount by weight of active compound per unit volume of soil, which is given in ppm (= mg/1), being decisive. The treated soil is filled into 250 ml pots and the pots are planted with pre-germinated broad beans. In this manner, the active compound can be taken up from the soil by the roots of the plants and transported into the leaves.<br>
To demonstrate the root-systemic effect, the leaves are populated with the abovementioned test animals after 7 days. After a further 7 days, the test is evaluated by estimating the dead animals. The root-systemic effect of the active compound is deduced from the destruction figures. It is 100% when all the test animals have been killed and 0% when just as many test insects are still alive as in the untreated control.<br>

Example 3 Critical concentration test/root-systemic action<br>
Test insect:	Phaedon cochlcariae larvae<br>
Solvent:	4 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The active compound preparation is mixed intimately with soil. The concentration of the active compound in the preparation is of virtually no importance, only the amount by weight of active compound per unit volume of soil, which is given in ppm (= mg/1), being decisive. The treated soil is filled into 500 ml pots, 8 cabbage seeds are placed at a depth of approximately 1 cm, the hole is filled and the soil surface is pressed down gently.<br>
To demonstrate the root-systemic effect, the leaves are populated with the abovementioned test animals after 9 days. After a further 3 days, the test is evaluated by estimating the leaf-feeding in the treated and in the untreated plant. The effect is 100% if, compared with the untreated control, only little feeding damage is observed; it is 0% when the entire cabbage has been eaten.<br>
