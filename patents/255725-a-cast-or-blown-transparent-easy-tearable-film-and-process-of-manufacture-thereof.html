				<td>The present invention relates to a cast film or blown film having a high<br>
transparency, easy tear features and low extractables. Furthermore, the<br>
invention is related to a process for making the films as well as to the use of a<br>
heterophasic propylene composition for cast films and blown films.<br>
In the recent years there has been an increasing demand of heat-sealed pouches,<br>
in particular in the food industry, for example for rice or fodder for dogs and<br>
cats. A very well-known problem of such filled pouches is their opening.<br>
Often, the pouches can only be opened with a high effort at a predefined<br>
indentation (or perforation or notch) without using tools like knives and<br>
 scissors. Another problem is that a manula opening does not lead to a straight<br>
crack in the pouches but to a curved one increasing the risk that the content of<br>
the pouches ooze out unintended. Hence, there is a demand to develop films for<br>
pouches which can be easily opened manually at the notch leading to a straight<br>
crack in the pouch. Described with physical parameters, it means that the tear<br>
energy has to be minimized and that the crack should develop straight in a pre-<br>
defined direction starting from the notch and usually in parallel direction to the<br>
upper side of the pouch. The materials used for such purpose have to be tough<br>
enough to resist impact loading at room or sub-ambient temperatures. Resins<br>
like polypropylene homopolymers and ethylene-propylene random copolymers<br>
which are brittle under severe loading are therefore excluded. Impact<br>
polypropylenes which are known for their high toughness are normally hazy<br>
and tend to develop plasticity when deformed, a property which limits the<br>
propagation of a linear crack through the pouch. Thus, they are no candidates<br>
of choice. Additionally the film shall fulfill certain standards issued by the food<br>
and drug administration (FDA), i.e. inter alia having low C6-extractables.<br>
Certainly the transparency of the film should also be good as the market favors<br>
transparent pouches.<br><br>
Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a cast film or<br>
blown film having a high transparency, easy tear features and low extractables.<br>
The finding of the present invention is to provide a cast film or a blown film<br>
comprising a composition of a polypropylene matrix and an ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber (EPR) whereby the particles of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) in<br>
the matrix develop a high orientation in one direction when the film is casted or<br>
blown.<br>
Hence, the present invention is related to a cast film or blown film comprising<br>
a composition comprising<br>
a)	80 to 95 wt% of a polypropylene matrix (A) with an MFR2 of 1 to 30<br>
g/10 min being a homopolymer or a copolymer which has a comonomer<br>
content of less than 3 wt%;<br>
b)	5 to 20 wt% of an ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) (B) with at least 55<br>
wt% propylene having an intrinsic viscosity (IV) of 1 to 2.5 dl/g; and<br>
c)	0.0001 to 1 wt% of an alpha-nucleating agent (C).<br>
Surprisingly, it had been found that such a cast film or blown film possesses a<br>
high transparency, low extractables and also very good tear features expressed<br>
in a low tear resistance, low tear whitening, low tear plasticity and a low tear<br>
angle.<br>
Definition of tear features<br>
Tear resistance, tear whitening, tear plasticity and tear angle have been used to<br>
describe the easy-tear performance of the different materials. Tear resistance<br>
(W), also called tear energy in the following, is that energy needed to propagate<br>
a crack in a precut sample at room temperature according to ISO 6383-2. It is<br>
commonly known as Elmendorf test. Tear resistance was determined at room<br>
temperature on 75*63*0.1 mm or 75*63*0.05 mm samples with a precut slit of<br>
20 mm according to ISO 6383-2. The force required to tear the specimen<br>
completely along its length was used to calculate the tear resistance.<br><br>
Tear whitening (TW), tear plasticity (TP) and tear angle (TA) have been<br>
determined post mortem on the fractured samples used to assess the tear energy<br>
within 48 hours after having performed the Elmendorf test. Values provided in<br>
the following are valid for these fractured samples and correspond to about half<br>
of what would have been measured considering the whole samples (which<br>
consist of two broken halves).<br>
The tear whitening corresponds to the degree of whitening of the area around<br>
the fracture surface. It has been determined with a ruler and rationalized with<br>
marks: 0 correspond to no tear whitening at all, 1 to a tear whitening 
2 to a tear whitening in between 0.3-0.5 mm (0.5 mm excluded), 3 to a tear<br>
whitening in between 0.5-1.0 mm (1.0 mm excluded), 4 to a tear whitening in<br>
between 1.0-2.0 mm (2.0 mm excluded), 5 to a tear whitening above 2.0 mm (2<br>
" mm included)"<br>
The tear plasticity corresponds to the size of the damaged area around the<br>
fracture surface. This damaged zone is often called plastic zone. Depending on<br>
the polymer composition it will or won't exhibit whitening. It has been<br>
determined with a ruler and rationalized with marks: 0 correspond to no<br>
plasticity at all, 1 to a localized damage near the crack which size is 
to a damage localized in a zone of 1-2 mm around the main crack (2 mm<br>
excluded), 3 to a damage localized in a zone of 2-5 mm around the main crack<br>
(5 mm excluded), 4 to a damage localized in a zone of 5-10 mm around the<br>
main crack (10 mm excluded), 5 to a damage localized in a zone of &gt; 10 mm<br>
around the main crack.<br>
The tear angle corresponds to the deviation of the crack towards a straight<br>
propagation. It has been measured with a protractor.<br>
All the above mentioned parameters have to be fulfilled to consider a material<br>
as easy tearable:<br><br><br><br>
Usually the notch (precut) is made in the machine direction, since the energy<br>
needed to propagate the crack is there the lowest. However, if WTD 
(preferably 
perfectly adapted as tear direction.<br>
To achieve these very good tear features, it is in particular necessary that the<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) particles are expanded in one direction, i.e.<br>
that they are oriented in the direction in which the crack develops. To achieve<br>
this aim, a composition is needed as defined above. Hence the synergistic effect<br>
of all features contributes to a deformation of the ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) particles in the propylene matrix leading to the orientation effect, which<br>
is mainly responsible for the good tear features but has also a positive influence<br>
on the transparency and low extractable properties.<br>
An important requirement in this context is the intrinsic viscosity of the<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR).<br>
The mtrinsic viscosity (IV) is a measure of the capability of a polymer in<br>
solution to enhance the viscosity of the solution. Intrinsic viscosity (IV) is<br>
correlated positively with the polymer molecular weight. The intrinsic viscosity<br>
(IV) is defined as the limiting value of the specific viscosity/concentration ratio<br>
at zero concentration. It thus becomes necessary to find the viscosity at<br>
different concentrations and then extrapolate to zero concentration. The<br>
variation of the viscosity number with concentration depends on the type of<br>
molecules as well as on the solvent. In general, the intrinsic viscosity of linear<br>
macromolecular substances is related to the molecular weight or degree of<br>
polymerization. With linear macromolecules, viscosity number measurements<br>
can provide a method for the rapid determination of molecular weight when the<br>
relationship between viscosity and molecular weight has been established.<br><br>
The intrinsic viscosity (IV) in this application is measured according to DIN<br>
ISO 1628-1 (October 1999).<br>
Accordingly, if the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) is too high, i.e. higher than 2.5 dl/g, then the film will have a too high<br>
impact strength, which influences the tear resistance negatively, i.e. the tear<br>
energy is rather high. Moreover a high intrinsic viscosity (IV) is also<br>
correlated with rather big particles (with a diameter above 500 nm as observed<br>
on electron microscopy micrographs). Big particles, however, diminish the<br>
transparency of the film. On the other hand, if the intrinsic viscosity (IV) is too<br>
low, i.e. lower than 1.0 dl/g, then a production of the composition is rather<br>
difficult.<br>
It is in particular preferred, that the intrinsic viscosity (IV) is not higher than<br>
2.3 dl/g, more preferably not higher than 2.2 dl/g and most preferably not<br>
higher than 2.1 dl/g. In turn, the lower limit of the intrinsic viscosity (IV) is<br>
preferably not lower than 1.2 dl/g, more preferably not lower than 1.4 dl/g.<br>
Preferred ranges are 1.0 to 2.3 dl/g, more preferably 1.2 to 2.3 dl/g, still more<br>
preferably 1.2 to 2.2 dl/g and most preferably 1.2 to 2.1 dl/g.<br>
Preferably, not only the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the ethylene-propylene<br>
rubber (EPR) alone should be considered, but also the polypropylene matrix<br>
used. It should be in particular avoided that the ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) has a similar intrinsic viscosity (IV) to the polypropylene matrix. A<br>
good elongation of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) is especially achieved<br>
if the intrinsic viscosities of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) particles and<br>
the polypropylene matrix differ to some extent. Therefore to further improve<br>
the orientation effect, it is preferred that the polypropylene matrix has a higher<br>
intrinsic viscosity (IV) than the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR). This<br>
proportion of the polypropylene matrix and the ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
(EPR) to each other enables a specifically good elongation of the ethylene-<br>
propylene rubber particles in the polypropylene matrix. It has been, in<br>
particular, found out that it is especially preferred that the ratio of the intrinsic<br><br>
viscosity (IV) of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) to the polypropylene<br>
matrix (IVEPR/IVmatrix) is not higher than 0.85, more preferably not higher than<br>
0.8. Preferably, the polypropylene matrix has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) of 1.8<br>
to 4.0 dl/g, more preferably of 2.0 to 3.5 dl/g.<br>
As stated above the intrinsic viscosity (IV) is of particular relevance in this<br>
application, as it influences the orientation effect needed. On the other hand the<br>
intrinsic viscosity (IV) is an indicator of the molecular weight. A high intrinsic<br>
viscosity (IV) results from a high molecular weight. Another way to express<br>
the molecular weight of a polymer is by way of its melt flow rate (MFR). The<br>
melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is due to<br>
the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow-tendency than<br>
short molecules. An increase in molecular weight means a decrease in the<br>
MFR-value. The melrflow rate (RFR) is measured in g/10 min of the polymer<br>
discharged through a defined dye under specified temperature and pressure<br>
conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each<br>
type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its<br>
degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg (ISO<br>
1133) is denoted as MFR2. Hence as both measuring methods are interlinked<br>
by the molecular weight of the polymer, also the melt flow rate (MFR) has to<br>
be carefully considered.<br>
Therefore it is required, that the polypropylene matrix shall have a specific<br>
melt flow rate (MFR). If the melt flow rate MFR2 is too low (high molecular<br>
weight polymer matrix), i.e. lower than 1 g/10min, then, the easy tear features<br>
are far from target due to the high ductility of the matrix which promotes<br>
plastic deformation. Hence, the polypropylene matrix shall have an MFR2 of<br>
not lower than 1 g/lOmin, more preferably not lower than 1.5 g/lOmin. On the<br>
other hand, if the MFR2 is too high, i.e. higher than 30 g/lOmin, then the<br>
polypropylene matrix has inferior transparency and can not easily been<br>
processed. Moreover a too high melt flow rate (MFR2) of the polypropylene<br>
matrix boosts the particle size of the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) which is<br><br>
also detrimental for the orientation effect as well as for the transparency of the<br>
film. It is in particular preferred, that the MFR2 of the polypropylene matrix is<br>
not higher than 20 g/10 min, more preferably not higher than 10 g/10min.<br>
In addition it is preferred, that the composition has a MFR2 of at least 1.5 g/10<br>
min, more preferably of at least 2 g/lOmin.<br>
The type of polypropylene matrix is not restricted to a specific one, as long as<br>
the matrix fulfills the above mentioned requirements. Hence, each<br>
homopolymer or copolymer can be used. In case a copolymer is used, the<br>
comonomer content, however, shall be less than 3 wt%, otherwise the film gets<br>
too ductile affecting negatively the easy tear features. Preferably, the<br>
comonomer is ethylene.<br>
The choice of ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) must conform with the<br>
orientation requirement and the transparency targeted. Hence an ethylene-<br>
propylene rubber (EPR) is needed having a high propylene amount, i.e. a<br>
propylene amount of at least 55 wt% in the rubber. More preferably the amount<br>
of propylene in the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) is at least 58 wt%, more<br>
preferably at least 60 wt%.<br>
Moreover to achieve good tear features the weight ratio of the polypropylene<br>
matrix and the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) must be kept in a specific<br>
range. Accordingly, the composition does not have more than 20 wt% of the<br>
ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), otherwise the film will be too soft and a<br>
linear crack cannot be guaranteed anymore. Therefore the amount of<br>
polypropylene matrix must range from 80 to 95 wt%, preferably in the range of<br>
82 to 93 wt%. In turn, the ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) must be in the<br>
range of 5 to 20 wt%, preferably in the range of 7 to 18 wt%.<br>
To achieve the desired properties of the present invention, it has been further<br>
found out, that also the film must have a high cristallinity. A highly structured<br>
(crystal) polymer has improved optical and mechanical properties, i.e. a good<br>
tear performance expressed by a low tear energy.<br><br>
Therefore the composition employed must comprise an alpha-nucleating agent<br>
in the amount of 0.0001 to 1 wt%, preferably in the amount of 0.001 to 0.5<br>
wt%.<br>
Alpha-nucleating agents of polypropylene are substances with the ability to act<br>
as substrates for crystal formation by epitaxy thus increasing the number of<br>
nuclei of the system. Thereby the nucleating agents improve the crystallization<br>
behavior in processing, i.e. decreasing the cycle time or increasing the line<br>
speed, increase the crystallinity in the final product and, additionally, improve<br>
the optical and mechanical properties in terms of improved stiffness and here of<br>
lower tear energy.<br>
Any suitable alpha-nucleating agent known in the art can be used. However, it<br>
is preferred to use at least one alpha-nucleating agent selected from the group<br>
consisting of sodium benzoate, l,3:2,4-bis-(3,4-dimethyl-benzylidene)-sorbitol,<br>
sodium-2,2l-methylenebis-(4,6-di-tert-butyl-phenyl)-phosphate	and<br>
hydroxybis-(2,4,8,10-tetra-tert-butyl-6-hydroxy-12h-dibenzo-(d,g)( 1,3,2)-<br>
dioxaphosphocin-6-oxidato)-aluminium. A further a-nucleation method, herein<br>
referred to as "BNT", is a special reactor technique, where the catalyst is<br>
prepolymerised with monomers like vinylcyclohexane (VCH). This method is<br>
described in greater detail in e.g. EP 0 316 187 A2. For the purpose of this<br>
invention "BNT" is referred to as a-nucleating agent.<br>
Preferably, the thickness of the film should not be too high since otherwise a<br>
significant loss in transparency will be the effect. Therefore, it is preferred that<br>
the film has a thickness of 5 to 200 µm, more preferably of 10 to 150 µm.<br>
Preferably, the film shall have only few C6-extractables measured according to<br>
FDA-HHS 177.1520 where 2.5g of the sample are extracted at 50°C with 1 1<br>
hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h. It is in particular preferred that the<br>
amount of C6-extractables shall be equal or lower than 2.6 wt%, more<br>
preferably equal or lower than 2.4 wt%.<br><br>
It is in particular preferred that the film of the present invention has a tear<br>
resistance in machine direction (WMD) determined by ISO 6383-2 of lower than<br>
20 N/rnm, more preferably of lower than 15 N/mm, most preferably of lower<br>
than 12.5 N/mm when measured on 100 µm thick films.<br>
More preferably, the inventive film has a WTD/WMD-ratio of more than 2, more<br>
preferably of more than 2.3, whereby WTD is the tear-resistance of the film in a<br>
transverse direction determined by ISO 6383-2 when measured on 100 um<br>
thick films.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the film has a tear-angle (TA) in machine<br>
direction of equal or less than 2.5°, more preferably equal or less than 2.2°,<br>
most preferably equal or less than 2.0° when measured on 100 µm thick<br>
samples after having performed a test according to ISO 6383-2. Moreover, it is<br>
preferred that the film has tear angle (TA) in transverse direction of less than<br>
4.5°, more preferably less than 4.0° when measured on 100 µm thick samples<br>
after having performed a test according to ISO 6383-2.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the film has a haze of lower than 21%, more<br>
preferably lower than 18%, most preferably lower than 15%, determined<br>
according to ASTM D 1003-92 when measured on 100 urn thick films.<br>
Preferably, the film has a gloss of better than 42%, more preferably better than<br>
48%, most preferably better than 52%, determined according to ISO 2813<br>
when measured on 100 µm thick films.<br>
Moreover, the present invention comprises the use of the composition as<br>
defined above for producing a cast film or blown film. In particular, it is<br>
preferred that the composition and the cast film or blown film as defined above<br>
is used for producing a pouch, label film, twist film, form-fill-and-seal (FFS)<br>
film and vertical-bag-form-fill-and-seal (VFFS) film.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is related to a process for producing a cast<br>
film as defined above comprising the steps of<br><br>
(i) pouring or spreading a solution, hot melt or dispersion of a material onto<br>
a temporary carrier,<br>
(ii) hardening the material, and<br>
(iii) stripping the hardened film from the surface of the carrier, whereby the<br>
material is a composition as described above, in particular a composition<br>
comprising<br>
a.	80 to 95 wt% of a polypropylene matrix with an MFR2 of 1 to 30<br>
g/10min being a homopolymer or a copolymer, which has a comonomer<br>
content of less than 3 wt%;<br>
b.	5 to 20 wt% of an ethylene-propylene-rubber (EPR) with at least 55 wt%<br>
propylene having an intrinsic viscosity (IV) of 1 to 2.5 dl/g; and<br>
c. 0.0001 to 1 wt% ot an a-nucieating agent.<br>
Further, the present invention is related to a process for producing a blown film<br>
as described above thereby comprising the steps of<br>
(i) blowing up a tube of molten material with air perpendicularly to the<br>
upwards direction from a side-fed blown film die;<br>
(ii) cooling it down with air from the outside on a cooling ring;<br>
(iii) folding it and guiding it over deflector rolls onto the winder<br>
wherein the material is a composition as defined above, in particular a<br>
composition comprising<br>
a)	80 to 95 wt% of a polypropylene matrix with an MFR2 of 1 to 30 g/10<br>
min being a homopolymer or a copolymer, which has a comonomer<br>
content of less than 3 wt%;<br>
b)	5 to 20 wt% of ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) with at least 55 wt%<br>
propylene having an intrinsic viscosity (IV) of 1 to 2.5 dl/g; and<br>
c)	0.0001 to 1 wt% of an alpha-nucleating agent.<br><br>
Alternatively, the blown films may be produced by tubular quench technology<br>
with water cooling.<br>
The propylene polymer blends of the present invention are preferably produced<br>
by combining the propylene polymer A in the form of powder or granules, the<br>
elastomeric copolymer B, and the α-nucleating agent C in a melt mixing<br>
device.<br>
Melt mixing devices suited for this process are discontinuous and continuous<br>
kneaders, twin screw extruders and single screw extruders with special mixing<br>
sections and co-kneaders. The residence time must be chosen such that a<br>
sufficiently high degree of homogenisation is achieved.<br>
Production of polypropylene matrix A<br>
The propylene polymer may be produced by single- or multistage process<br>
polymerisation of propylene or propylene and α-olefin and/or ethylene such as<br>
bulk polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation, slurry polymerisation, solution<br>
polymerisation or combinations thereof using conventional catalysts. A homo-<br>
or copolymer can be made either in loop reactors or in a combination of loop<br>
and gas phase reactor. Those processes are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
A suitable catalyst for the polymerisation of the propylene polymer is any<br>
stereospecific catalyst for propylene polymerisation which is capable of<br>
polymerising and copolymerising propylene and comonomers at a temperature<br>
of 40 to 110°C and at a pressure from 10 to 100 bar. Ziegler Natta catalysts as<br>
well as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
One skilled in the art is aware of the various possibilities to produce propylene<br>
homo- and copolymers and will simply find out a suitable procedure to produce<br>
suitable polymers which are used in the present invention.<br><br>
Production of ethylene-propylene rubber<br>
An ethylene-propylene-rubber (B) may be produced by known polymerisation<br>
processes such as solution, suspension and gas-phase polymerisation using<br>
conventional catalysts. Ziegler Natta catalysts as well as metallocene catalysts<br>
are suitable catalysts.<br>
A widely used process is the solution polymerisation. Ethylene, propylene and<br>
catalyst systems are polymerised in an excess of hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
Stabilisers and oils, if used, are added directly after polymerisation. The solvent<br>
and unreacted monomers are then flashed off with hot water or steam, or with<br>
mechanical devolatilisation. The polymer, which is in crumb form, is dried<br>
with dewatering in screens, mechanical presses or drying ovens. The crumb is<br>
formed into wrapped bales or extruded into pellets.<br>
The suspension polymerisation process is a modification of bulk<br>
polymerisation. The monomers and catalyst system are injected into the reactor<br>
filled with propylene. The polymerisation takes place immediately, forming<br>
crumbs of polymer that are not soluble in the propylene. Flashing off the<br>
propylene and comonomer completes the polymerisation process.<br>
The gas-phase polymerisation technology consists of one or more vertical<br>
fluidised beds. Monomers and nitrogen in gas form along with catalyst are fed<br>
to the reactor and solid product is removed periodically. Heat of reaction is<br>
removed through the use of the circulating gas that also serves to fluidise the<br>
polymer bed. Solvents are not used, thereby eliminating the need for solvent<br>
stripping, washing and drying.<br>
The production of ethylene propylene rubber (B) is also described in detail in<br>
e.g. US 3,300,459, US 5,919,877, EP 0 060 090 Al and in a company<br>
publication by EniChem "DUTRAL, Ethylene-Propylene Elastomers" , pages<br>
1-4(1991).<br>
Alternatively, ethylene-propylene rubber (B), which are commercially<br>
available and which fulfil the indicated requirements, can be used.<br><br>
Alternatively, polymers A and B may be produced in a series of reactors, i.e.<br>
starting with the production of polymer A in a loop reactor and transferring the<br>
product into a gas phase reactor, where copolymer B is polymerised.<br>
It is additionally preferred that the films are oriented by monoaxial or biaxial<br>
orientation processes. In this way the tearability can be enhanced even further,<br>
especially beyond that of standard block-copolymers.<br>
In another embodiment the polymer composition can be coextruded to afford a<br>
multi-layered film. The main layer thereby preferably comprises the described<br>
polymer composition, while one or more outside layers can be added. It is<br>
preferred that the outside layers have the same or a lower tearability. Exploiting<br>
this arrangement leads to highly tearable films. The outside layer can also be a<br>
thin layer of an especially transparent RACO (random copolymer)film.<br>
Description of measurement methods<br>
MFR<br>
The melt flow rates were measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230°C. The melt<br>
flow rate is that quantity of polymer in grams which the test apparatus<br>
standardized to ISO 1133 extrudes within 10 minutes at a temperature of 230°C<br>
under a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
Intrinsic Viscosity<br>
Intrinsic viscosity was measured according to DIN ISO 1628-1 (October 1999)<br>
in Decalin at 135°C.<br>
Gloss<br>
Gloss was determined according to ISO 2813 on 100 urn thick films at an angle<br>
of 20°.<br><br>
Haze<br>
Haze was determined according to ASTM D 1003-92 on 50 and 100 µm thick<br>
films. C6-solubles<br>
C6-solubles were determined according to FDA-HHS 177.1520 where 2.5 g of<br>
the sample are extracted at 50°C with 11 n-hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus for<br>
24h.<br>
Tear Resistance<br>
Tear resistance was determined at room temperature on 75*63*0.1 mm or<br>
75*63*0.05 mm samples with a precut slit of 20 mm according to ISO 6383-2<br>
(Elmendorf test). The force required to tear the specimen completely along its<br>
length was used to calculate the tear resistance.<br>
Tear whitening<br>
Tear whitening was determined on the fractured samples used to measure the<br>
tear resistance according to an internal Borealis method. It has been assessed<br>
with a ruler and rationalized with marks: 0 corresponds to no tear whitening at<br>
all, 1 to a tear whitening 
mm (0.5 mm excluded), 3 to a tear whitening in between 0.5-1.0 mm (1.0 mm<br>
excluded), 4 to a tear whitening in between 1.0-2.0 mm (2.0 mm excluded), 5<br>
to a tear whitening above 2.0 mm (2 mm included).<br>
Tear Plasticity<br>
Tear plasticity was determined on the fractured samples used to measure the<br>
tear resistance according to an internal Borealis method. It has been assessed<br>
with a ruler and rationalized with marks: 0 correspond to no plasticity at all, 1<br>
to a localized damage near the crack which size is 
localized in a zone of 1-2 mm around the main crack (2 mm excluded), 3 to a<br>
damage localized in a zone of 2-5 mm around the main crack (5 mm excluded),<br>
4 to a damage localized in a zone of 5-10 mm around the main crack (10 mm<br>
excluded), 5 to a damage localized in a zone of &gt; 10 mm around the main crack<br><br>
Tear Angle<br>
Tear angle was determined on the fractured samples used to measure the tear<br>
resistance according to an internal Borealis method. It corresponds to the<br>
deviation of the crack towards a straight propagation. It has been measured<br>
with a protractor.<br>
Dart Drop Impact<br>
Dart Drop Impact (DDI) was determined according to ISO 7765-1 at room<br>
temperature. The energy (here expressed in form of weight in g) that causes films to<br>
fail under specified conditions of impact of a free-falling dart from a height of 660<br>
mm that would result in 50% failure of the specimen is determined (F50). 20<br>
specimens were tested for each weight.<br>

The following homopolymers and random copolymers were prepared<br>
analogously according to the above procedure (Table 1):<br><br>
Preparation of ethylene-propylene rubber (B)<br>
The elastomeric copolymers of the present invention were prepared according<br>
to the following procedure:<br>
A 5 1-reactor (autoclave) filled with about 0.2 barg propylene (polymerisation<br>
grade) is pressured up with the required amount of H2 in order to achieve the<br>
targeted intrinsic viscosity of the elastomeric copolymer. Then 300 g of<br>
propylene are added.<br>
5 mg of a ZN101 (supplied by Basell) catalyst is contacted with 0.3 ml white<br>
oil for about 16 hours and then activated for 5 minutes with a mixture of<br>
Triethylaluminium (TEA1; solution in hexane 1 mol/1) and an alkoxysilane<br>
(Dicyclopentyldimethoxysilan in the examples) as donor (0.3 mol/1 in hexane) -<br>
in a molar ratio of 16 using a contact time of 5 min. The molar ratio of TEA1<br>
and Ti of catalyst was 380 and TEA1 concentration in TEAl/donor mixture<br>
12.6 mg/ml hexane. After activation the catalyst is transferred to the reactor by<br><br>
spilling in with 500 g propylene. After 12 min pre-polymerisation at 30 °C a<br>
specified amount of ethylene is added to the reactor and the temperature is<br>
increased to the target polymerisation temperature (55 °C in the examples).<br>
During heating up additional ethylene dosing is started to achieve the target<br>
total pressure at the target polymerisation temperature. Total pressure is hold<br>
constantly via continuously dosing of ethylene during polymerisation. 30 min<br>
after end of prepolymerisation the reaction is stopped by flashing of monomers<br>
and cooling.<br>
The polymer is stabilized with 0.1 wt% of Sandostab P-EPQ and 0.2 wt% of<br>
Ionol in acetone and dried over night in a hood and additionally for 2 hours at<br>
50 °C under vacuum.<br><br><br><br><br>
