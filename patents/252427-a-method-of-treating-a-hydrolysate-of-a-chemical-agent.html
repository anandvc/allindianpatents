				<td>TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL AGENT HYDROLYSATES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods for the destruction of chemical<br>
weapons. In particular, the present invention relates to novel methods for treating<br>
hydrolysates of chemical agents utilized to construct chemical weapons.	<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Destruction of chemical weapons is a paramount international concern that has<br>
initiated the passage of international treaties, such as the United Nations' Chemical<br>
Weapons Convention Treaty, outlawing chemical weapon development, production, and<br>
stockpiling. More importantly, these international treaties require signatory countries to<br>
effectuate a scheduled destruction of chemical weapon and chemical agent stockpiles.<br>
Destruction of chemical agents is conventionally achieved by means of<br>
incineration. Although incineration represents a technically feasible approach to the<br>
destruction of chemical agents, it is not acceptable to the many State and local<br>
governments and communities neighboring the stockpile sites. The major concerns of<br>
these entities include the perceived health hazards associated with air emissions from<br>
incinerators.<br>
In view of the perceived hazards resulting from incineration, alternative methods<br>
have been developed to destroy chemical agents used in chemical weapons. One<br>
promising alternative method destroys or neutralizes chemical agents by hydrolyzing the<br>
chemical agents. Several significant problems exist, however, in hydrolyzing chemical<br>
agents. One problem is the caustic, odiferous, and toxic nature of the resulting<br>
hydrolysate. Additionally, hydrolysates contain precursors of the chemical agent, which<br>
presents additional problems in relation to regulatory compliance. Chemical weapons<br>
treaties specify that in order to realize complete destruction of a chemical agent, any<br>
precursors capable of reacting to reform the chemical agent must additionally be<br>
destroyed.<br><br>
In view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide methods for the<br>
treatment of chemical agent hydrolysates that reduce the toxicity of the hydrolysate while<br>
rendering chemical precursors inoperable to react in reforming the hydrolyzed chemical<br>
agent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for the treatment of chemical agent<br>
hydrolysates. In particular, the present invention successfully enables the treatment of<br>
chemical agent hydrolysates that reduce the toxicity of the hydrolysate while rendering<br>
constituent chemical precursors inoperable to react in reforming the hydrolyzed agent.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method comprising<br>
oxidizing a hydrolysate of a chemical agent to form an aqueous layer and an organic<br>
layer; wherein the aqueous layer comprises an organophosphorus concentration and the<br>
organic layer comprises an organosulfur concentration; wherein the organic layer is<br>
separated from the aqueous layer.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method comprising<br>
oxidizing a hydrolysate of a chemical agent to form an aqueous layer and an organic<br>
layer, the aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus concentration and the organic<br>
layer comprising an organosulfur concentration, and oxidizing and precipitating the<br>
organophosphorus concentration from the aqueous layer.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method comprising<br>
oxidizing an organophosphorus concentration of a chemical agent hydrolysate solution<br>
and precipitating the oxidized organophosphorus from the hydrolysate solution.<br>
A feature and advantage of the present invention is that methods of the present<br>
invention may be used for the treatment of chemical agent hydrolysates resulting in the<br>
destruction of chemical agent precursors thereby ensuring compliance with international<br>
chemical weapon treaties.<br>
With the foregoing and other advantages and features of the invention that will<br>
become hereinafter apparent, the nature of the invention may be more clearly understood<br>
by reference to the following non-limiting detailed description of the invention and the<br>
several views illustrated in the drawings.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is an illustration of one environment for implementation of an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a flowchart for a method according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for the treatment of chemical agent<br>
hydrolysates. Methods of the present invention may be advantageously utilized in the<br>
destruction of chemical agent precursors present in hydrolysates rendering the precursors<br>
incapable of reforming the chemical agent. Hydrolysates of chemical agents comprising<br>
VX, Russian VX (RVX), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and Tabun (GA) may be treated in<br>
accordance with methods of the present invention.<br>
Reference is made below to specific embodiments of the present invention. Each<br>
embodiment is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the<br>
invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or<br>
spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one<br>
embodiment may be incorporated into another embodiment to yield a further<br>
embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and<br>
variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers<br>
expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the<br>
specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about."<br>
Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the<br>
following specification are approximations that can vary, depending upon the desired<br>
properties sought to be obtained with the present invention. At the very,least,and not as<br>
an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the<br>
Claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of<br>
reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.	<br><br>
Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad<br>
scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific<br>
examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however,<br>
inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found<br>
in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be<br>
understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein, and every number<br>
between the end points. For example, a stated range of "1 to 10" should be considered to<br>
include any and all subranges between (and inclusive of) the minimum value of 1 and the<br>
maximum value of 10; that is, all subranges beginning with a minimum value of 1 or<br>
more, e.g., 1 to 6.1, and ending with a maximum value of 10 or less, e.g., 5.5 to 10, as<br>
well as all ranges beginning and ending within the end points, e.g., 2 to 9, 3 to 8, 3.2 to<br>
9.3, 4 to 7, and finally to each number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9 and 10 contained within the<br>
range. Additionally, any reference referred to as being "incorporated herein" is to be<br>
understood as being incorporated in its entirety.<br>
It is further noted that, as used in this specification, the singular forms "a," "an,"<br>
and "the" include plural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one<br>
referent.<br>
In an embodiment, a method of the present invention for treating a hydrolysate of<br>
a chemical agent comprises oxidizing the hydrolysate to form an aqueous layer and an<br>
organic layer, the aqueous layer comprising an organphosphorus concentration and the<br>
organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration, and separating the organic layer<br>
from the aqueous layer.     <br>
Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals indicate like elements<br>
throughout the several figures, Figure 1 is an illustration of one environment for<br>
implementation of an embodiment of the present invention. The environment illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 comprises an apparatus 100 comprising a first treatment tank 101, a second<br>
treatment tank 102, a mixing tank 103, a pre-bioreactor equalization tank 104, an organic<br>
matter supply tank 112, and a bioreactor 110. The apparatus 100 of Figure 1 may further<br>
comprise piping systems 105,106, 107, 108, 109, lll,andll3.<br>
Moreover, Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.   The method illustrated in Figure 2 is described<br><br>
with reference to the treatment of a VX nerve agent hydrolysate. Additionally, the<br>
method illustrated in Figure 2 is further described with reference to the environment of<br>
the apparatus 100 of Figure 1. The presently described method, however, is not limited<br>
to a hydrolysate of a VX nerve agent, nor is it limited to the environment of the apparatus<br>
100 of Figure 1. Other chemical agents, such as Russian VX (RVX), may be degraded<br>
according to the presently described method.<br>
A VX nerve agent hydrolysate and a first oxidant may be disposed in a first<br>
treatment tank (101) 201. The VX nerve agent hydrolysate, for example, may flow into<br>
the first treatment tank (101) through a piping system (105). Oxidants suitable for<br>
serving as a first oxidant in the present method may comprise hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),<br>
oxygen, ozone, air, hypochlorite, persulfate, permanganate, or any combination thereof.<br>
The first oxidant oxidizes chemical components of the hydrolysate to generate an<br>
aqueous layer and an organic layer, the aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus<br>
concentration and the organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration 202. In the<br>
present embodiment, water-soluble thiolamines, such as 2-(Diisopropylamino) ethanthiol<br>
present in the VX hydrolysate are oxidized to water-insoluble disulfides. The oxidant<br>
may be added in a stoichiometric amount to oxidize substantially all of the thiolamine<br>
concentration to a disulfide concentration. In embodiments where the added oxidant<br>
decomposes due to side reactions with the hydrolysate, the amount of oxidant added may<br>
exceed the stoichiometric amount. Moreover, the stoichiometric amount of oxidant<br>
added may vary depending on the identity of the oxidant chosen, but a molar ratio of<br>
oxidizing agent to thiolamine will generally range from about 0.5 to 1 to about 5 to 1.<br>
The oxidation of water-soluble thiolamines into water-insoluble disulfides generates an<br>
organic layer containing the disulfides. Moreover, the aqueous layer formerly containing<br>
the water-soluble thiolamines of VX hydrolysate, as well as other organophosphorus<br>
compounds, now comprises various phosphonic acids such as methylphosphonic acid<br>
(MPA) and ethylmethylphosphonic acid (EMPA). Introduction of a first oxidant to the<br>
chemical agent hydrolysate immediately initiates the oxidation reaction. In some<br>
embodiments of the present invention, oxidation of the chemical agent hydrolysate by a<br>
first oxidant may be allowed to continue for up to one (1) hour.<br><br>
After production of an aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus<br>
concentration and an organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration, the organic<br>
layer may be separated from the aqueous layer by removing the organic layer to a second<br>
treatment tank (102) 203. The organic layer may be removed to a second treatment tank<br>
(102) through a piping system (106) which places the first treatment tank (101) in<br>
communication with the second treatment tank (102). The aqueous layer remains in the<br>
first treatment tank (101).<br>
After separation of the organic layer from the aqueous layer, the<br>
organophosphorus concentration may be removed from the aqueous layer. Removing the<br>
organophosphorus concentration from the aqueous layer comprises oxidizing the<br>
organophosphorus concentration, precipitating the oxidized organophosphorus<br>
concentration comprising inorganic and organic phosphorus compounds from the<br>
aqueous layer, and separating the precipitated phosphorus concentration from the<br>
aqueous layer. As previously described, the phosphorus concentration of the aqueous<br>
layer comprises methyl phosphonic acid (MPA) and/or ethylmethylphosphonic acid<br>
(EMPA). Oxidation of these chemical species may lead to their irreversible<br>
decomposition since carbon-phosphorus bonds are attacked in the oxidation process<br>
thereby removing the methyl group from the phosphorus atom. Irreversible<br>
decomposition of these VX chemical agent precursors may preclude their recombination<br>
with thiolamines in reconstructing the chemical agent thereby ensuring chemical<br>
compliance with international chemical warfare treaties.<br>
Oxidation of the organophosphorus concentration of the aqueous layer comprises<br>
adding a metal catalyst, second oxidant, and pH adjusting chemical species to the first<br>
treatment tank (101) 204. Oxidants suitable for serving as a second oxidant comprise<br>
peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone, air, hypochlorite, or any<br>
combination thereof. The second oxidant may be added in a stoichiometric amount to<br>
oxidize substantially all the MPA and EMPA in the aqueous layer. The molar ratio of<br>
second oxidizing agent to MPA and EMPA may be from about 5 to 1 to about 40 to 1.<br>
Metal catalysts suitable for use in the oxidation of MPA and EMPA may<br>
comprise iron, magnesium, or combinations thereof. Iron catalysts comprising divalent<br>
(Fe+2) and trivalent iron (Fe+3), for example, may be obtained from commercial entities<br><br>
known to those skilled in the art such as Beckart Environmental, Inc. of Kenosha,<br>
Wisconsin. The stoichiometric amount of metal catalyst added to the aqueous layer may<br>
be sufficient to produce a molar ratio of metal catalyst to MPA and EMPA ranging from<br>
about 0.5 to 1 to about 3 to 1.<br>
A pH adjusting chemical species may be added to the aqueous layer in a sufficient<br>
amount to adjust the pH of the layer to reside within a pH range from about 4.5 to about<br>
6.0. Suitable pH adjusting chemical species for addition to the aqueous layer may<br>
comprise sodium hydroxide, lye, and/or potassium hydroxide.<br>
The second oxidant, metal catalyst, and pH adjusting species are mixed with the<br>
aqueous layer such as by stirring and the resulting solution may be allowed to sit for any<br>
time period, during which oxidation may occur. In some embodiments, depending on the<br>
concentration of the chemical agent hydrolysate, the time period for oxidation of the<br>
aqueous layer may range from about 15 minutes to about 10 hours. In the oxidation<br>
process, EMPA in the aqueous layer may be oxidized to MPA while MPA in the aqueous<br>
layer may be oxidized to ortho-phosphorus (PO43). MPA and ortho-phosphate are<br>
susceptible to precipitation from an aqueous mixture as iron-phosphorus polymers. As a<br>
result, when iron is present in the aqueous layer, the MPA and ortho-phosphate <br>
produced in the oxidation of the aqueous layer by the second oxidant precipitates as an<br>
iron-phosphorus polymer 205. In embodiments of the present invention, additional<br>
trivalent iron may be added to the aqueous solution after oxidation to precipitate further<br>
amounts of MPA and ortho-phosphate as iron-phosphorus polymer.<br>
The resulting iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate may be separated from the<br>
aqueous solution in the first treatment tank by filtration 206 or any other means known to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art. Once separated, the iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate<br>
may be combined with other solid waste such as plant material and safely disposed of in a<br>
suitable location, such as a landfill. The removal of the iron-phosphorus polymer<br>
generates an aqueous layer depleted of phosphorus containing compounds.<br>
Similarly, the organosulfur concentration may be removed from the organic layer.<br>
Removing the organosulfur concentration from the organic layer comprises, for example,<br>
oxidizing the organosulfur concentration of the organic layer to form a single aqueous<br><br>
layer, combining the single aqueous layer with the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer<br>
and biological material to produce a mixture, and biologically degrading the mixture.<br>
As previously described, the organosulfur layer produced by oxidation of the VX<br>
hydrolysate comprises disulfides. Oxidation of the disulfides in a second treatment tank<br>
(102) comprises adding a third oxidant, water, and a pH adjusting chemical species to the<br>
organic layer in the second treatment tank (102) 208. Oxidants suitable for serving as a<br>
third oxidant comprise a metal catalyst such as iron in conjunction with oxygen, ozone,<br>
air, hypochlorite, peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, or any combination thereof. The<br>
third oxidant may be added in a stoichiometric amount to oxidize substantially all of the<br>
disulfide concentration in the organic layer. The molar ratio of third oxidizing agent to<br>
disulfide concentration may range from about 3 to 1 to about 30 to 1.<br>
A pH adjusting chemical species may be added to the organic layer in a sufficient<br>
amount to adjust the pH of the layer to reside with a pH range from about 4.5 to about<br>
6.0. Suitable pH adjusting chemical species for addition to the organic layer comprise<br>
sodium hydroxide, lye, and/or potassium hydroxide. Water may be added to the organic<br>
layer at a volume of 2.5 times the volume of the organic layer.<br>
The third oxidant, pH adjusting species, and water are mixed by stirring, and the<br>
resulting solution may be allowed to sit for any time period, during which oxidation may<br>
occur. The oxidation of disulfides in the organic layer transforms the organic layer into a<br>
single aqueous layer in the second treatment tank (102) 209. Disulfides in the organic<br>
layer may be oxidized to various water-soluble sulfates thereby transforming the organic<br>
layer into a single aqueous-layer.<br>
The single aqueous layer formed by the oxidation of the organic layer in the<br>
second treatment tank (102) may be combined with the phosphorus-depleted aqueous<br>
layer of the first treatment tank (101) 210. Combination of the single aqueous layer with<br>
the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer may comprise mixing the two aqueous layers in a<br>
mixing tank (103). In other embodiments, the single aqueous layer formed by the<br>
oxidation of the organic layer in the second treatment tank (102) may be returned to the<br>
first treatment tank (101) for combination with the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer.<br>
The aqueous solution resulting from the combination of the single aqueous layer<br>
in the second treatment tank (102) with the phosphorus-depleted layer of the first<br><br>
treatment tank (101) may be transferred to a pre-bioreactor equalization tank (104) 211<br>
where the aqueous solution may be commingled with organic material such as plant flow.<br>
The plant flow may be introduced in the pre-bioreactor (104) from an organic matter<br>
storage tank (112) in communication with the pre-bioreactor through a piping system<br>
(113). The aqueous solution may be biodegraded in a bioreactor (110) downstream from<br>
the equalization tank (104) 212. When operated in batch mode the bioreactor may<br>
require a time period of 6-24 hours for degradation of the treated hydrolysate. The<br>
bioreactor may have a hydraulic residence time of 5-20 days and a solids retention time<br>
of 20-100 days.<br>
After biological degradation (212), the aqueous solution may be separated from<br>
solid matter in the bioreactor (110) 213. Separation of the aqueous solution from solid<br>
matter may be achieved through filtration of the solution or by any other separation<br>
technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Sedimentation, for example, may be<br>
another method by which the aqueous solution may be separated from solid matter in the<br>
bioreactor (110). The separated aqueous solution may be tested for permitted effluent<br>
limits and Schedule 2 compounds before being discharged. The separated aqueous<br>
solution may be discharged, for example, into a local publicly owned treatment works as<br>
non-hazardous water.<br>
The solids removed from the aqueous solution in the bioreactor (110) may be<br>
commingled with the phosphorus precipitate produced in the removal of the<br>
organophosphorus concentration from the aqueous layer in the first treatment tank (101)<br>
214. The commingled solids may be disposed in an appropriate landfill 207.<br>
In some embodiments, the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer may proceed<br>
directly to the biodegradation step (212) without being mixed with the single aqueous<br>
layer produced from the oxidation of an organosulfur concentration. The pH of the<br>
phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer may be adjusted to reside within a range from about 6<br>
to 8 and further treated biologically prior to discharge. The biologically treated<br>
phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer may be discharged, for example, into a publicly<br>
owned treatment works or may discharged or otherwise disposed of in any manner<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In other embodiments, the phosphorus-depleted<br><br>
aqueous layer may be combined with additional waste streams comprising biologically<br>
degradable compounds before undergoing biological treatment.<br>
Similarly, in some embodiments, the single aqueous phase produced from the<br>
oxidation of the organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration may proceed<br>
directly to the biodegradation step (212) without being mixed with the phosphorus-<br>
depleted aqueous layer. Moreover, the single aqueous layer may be mixed with other<br>
waste streams comprising biologically degradable compounds before undergoing<br>
biological treatment. The biologically treated single aqueous layer may be discharg<br>
into a body of water such as a publicly owned treatment works or may otherwise be<br>
disposed of in any manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In other embodiments, oxidation products of the organosulfur compounds<br>
produced in the oxidation of the organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration<br>
may be precipitated with metal salts comprising iron. Ferric chloride and/or ferrous<br>
sulfate, for example, may be used to precipitate organosulfur compounds produced in the<br>
oxidation of the organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration.<br>
In a further embodiment, a chemical agent hydrolysate may be treated with a first<br>
oxidant as previously described to form an aqueous layer and an organic layer, the<br>
aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus concentration and the organic layer<br>
comprising an organosulfur concentration. The organic layer may be separated from the<br>
aqueous layer. Subsequent to separation from the aqueous layer, the organic layer may<br>
be treated with an oxidant, pH adjusting species, and water as previously described.<br>
Moreover, the organophosphorus concentration may be removed from the aqueous layer<br>
in the absence of a second oxidant by the addition of a metal salt. Metal ions of the salts<br>
may precipitate the phosphorus containing compounds, such as MPA and ortho-<br>
phosphorus, from the aqueous layer as metal-phosphorus polymers. Metal salts suitable<br>
for precipitating the phosphorus containing compounds in the aqueous phase according to<br>
the present embodiment may comprise those of iron. Ferrous sulfate and ferric chloride,<br>
for example, may precipitate phosphorus containing compounds from the aqueous layer.<br>
The aqueous layer may be filtered to remove the phosphorus containing precipitate to<br>
form a phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer.  The phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer and<br><br>
oxidized organic layer may be recombined and biodegraded in a bioreactor as previously<br>
described.<br>
In another embodiment, a method of the present invention comprises oxidizing a<br>
hydrolysate of a chemical agent to form an aqueous layer and an organic layer, the<br>
aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus concentration and the organic layer<br>
comprising an organosulfur concentration, and oxidizing and precipitating the<br>
organophosphorus concentration from the aqueous layer. The present method is similar<br>
to the preceding method described with reference to Figures 1 and 2. In the present<br>
method, however, the organic layer is not separated from the aqueous layer subsequent to<br>
the initial oxidation.<br>
According to the present method, a hydrolysate of a chemical agent and a first<br>
oxidant may be disposed in a treatment tank or vessel. Oxidants suitable for serving as a<br>
first oxidant in the present method may comprise hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone, air,<br>
hypochlorite, persulfate, permanganate, or any combination thereof. The first oxidant<br>
oxidizes chemical components of the hydrolysate to generate an aqueous layer and an<br>
organic layer, the aqueous layer comprising an organophosphorus concentration and the<br>
organic layer comprising an organosulfur concentration. Water soluble thiolamines, such<br>
as 2-(Diisopropylarnino) -ethanethiol- present in the chemical agent hydrolysate are<br>
oxidized into water insoluble disulfides. The oxidant may be added in a stoichiometric<br>
amount to oxidize substantially all of the thiolamine concentration into a disulfide<br>
concentration. In embodiments where the oxidant decomposes due to side reactions in<br>
the hydrolysate, the amount* of oxidant added may exceed the stoichiometric amount.<br>
Moreover, the stoichiometric amount of oxidant may vary depending on the identity of<br>
the oxidant chosen, but a molar ratio of oxidizing agent to thiolamine will generally range<br>
from about 0.5 to 1 to about 5 tol. The oxidation of water-soluble thiolamines into<br>
water-insoluble disulfides generates an organic layer containing the disulfides.<br>
Moreover, the aqueous layer formerly containing the water-soluble thiolamines of the<br>
hydrolysate, as well as other organophosphorus compounds, comprises various<br>
phosphonic acids such as methylphosphonic acid (MPA) and ethylmethylphosphonic acid<br>
(TEMPA). Introduction of a first oxidant to the chemical agent hydrolysate immediately<br>
initiates the oxidation reaction. In some embodiments of the present invention, oxidation<br><br>
of the chemical agent hydrolysate by a first oxidant may be allowed to continue for up to<br>
one (1) hour.<br>
After production of an aqueous layer and organic layer, the organophosphorus<br>
concentration of the hydrolysate may be oxidized and precipitated from the aqueous<br>
layer. Oxidation and precipitation of the organophosphorus concentration comprises<br>
adding a second oxidant, metal catalyst, and pH adjusting species to the hydrolysate<br>
solution. The hydrolysate solution at this juncture comprises the aqueous layer and<br>
organic layer as the step of separating the organic layer from the aqueous layer has been<br>
omitted in the present method. Oxidants suitable for serving as a second oxidant in the<br>
present method are similar those oxidants which may serve as a second oxidant in the<br>
preceding method. Suitable second oxidants for the present method comprise oxygen,<br>
air, hypochlorite, and peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and/or ozone. The second<br>
oxidant may be utilized in conjunction with a metal catalyst such as iron.<br>
The oxidant may be added in a stoichiometric amount to oxidize substantially all<br>
of the organophosphorus concentration in the hydrolysate solution. The molar ratio of<br>
the oxidizing agent to the organophosphorus concentration may range from about 1 to 1<br>
to about 40 to 1. Moreover, the stoichiometric amount of metal catalyst added to the<br>
hydrolysate solution may be sufficient to produce a molar ratio of metal catalyst to<br>
organophosphorus concentration ranging from about 0.5 to 1 to about 3 to 1.<br>
A pH adjusting chemical species may be added to the hydrolysate solution in a<br>
sufficient amount to adjust the pH of the solution to reside with a pH range from about<br>
4.5 to about 6.0.	<br>
The oxidant, metal catalyst, and pH adjusting species are mixed with the<br>
hydrolysate solution in the first treatment tank by stirring, and the resulting solution may<br>
be allowed to sit for any time period, during which oxidation may occur. In some<br>
embodiments, depending on the concentration of the chemical agent hydrolysate, the time<br>
period for oxidation of the hydrolysate solution may range from about 15 minutes to<br>
about 10 hours. In the oxidation reaction, the organophosphorus concentration is<br>
oxidized to methyl-phosphonic acid (MPA) and ortho-phosphate (PO43). As previously<br>
described, MPA and ortho-phosphorus are susceptible to precipitation from an aqueous<br>
mixture as iron-phosphorus polymers. As a result, when iron is present in the hydrolysate<br><br>
solution, the MPA and ortho-phosphorus produced in the oxidation of the hydrolysate<br>
solution may precipitate as an iron-phosphorus polymer. In other embodiments,<br>
additional trivalent iron may be introduced into the first treatment tank after oxidation to<br><br>
precipitate further amounts of MPA and ortho-phosphate as iron-phosphorus polymer.<br>
The resulting iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate may be separated from the<br>
hydrolysate solution in the first treatment tank by filtration or any other means known to<br>
one or ordinary skill in the art. Once separated, the iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate<br>
may be combined with other solid waste such as plant material and safely disposed of in a<br>
landfill. The removal of the non-phosphorus polymer generates a depleted<br>
organophosphorus aqueous layer and renders organophosphorus precursors of a chemical<br>
agent hydrolysate incapable of reforming the chemical agent.<br>
The organophosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution may subsequently proceed<br>
to a pre-bioreactor equalization tank and bioreactor (110) for biodegradation. In some<br>
embodiments, the oxidation of the hydrolysate solution by the second oxidant may<br>
consume the organic layer comprising the organosulfur concentration. In such<br>
embodiments, the organic layer is transformed into a substantially aqueous layer<br>
comprising inorganic and organic sulfates. This newly formed aqueous layer comprising<br>
sulfates may be miscible with the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer and subsequently<br>
proceeds to the biodegradation step with the phosphorus-depleted aqueous layer.<br>
In biodegrading the organophosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution, the pH of<br>
the hydrolysate solution is adjusted to reside within a range from about 6 to 8. The<br>
organophosphorus hydrolysate solution may be combined with plant and/or other organic<br>
material and subsequently biodegraded. The biodegraded organophosphorus depleted<br>
hydrolysate solution may be discharged into a body of water such as a publicly owned<br>
treatment works or may be disposed of in any other manner known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, before biodegradation, the organophosphorus depleted<br>
hydrolysate solution may be combined with other waste streams comprising biologically<br>
degradable compounds.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a method comprises oxidizing an<br>
orgnophosphorus   concentration   of   a   chemical   agent   hydrolysate   solution   and<br><br>
precipitating the oxidized organophosphorus concentration from the hydrolysate solution.<br>
Hydrolysates suitable for use with the present method comprise hydrolysates containing a<br>
water-soluble organophosphorus concentration. Hydrolysates of Sarin (GB), Soman<br>
(GD), and Tabun (GA) in addition to the aqueous component of an oxidized VX<br>
hydrolysate, for example, are suitable for treatment by the present method.<br>
The oxidation and precipitation of the organophosphorus concentration of a<br>
hydrolysate solution may occur in a manner substantially similar to the removal of the<br>
organophosphorus concentration from the aqueous layers described in the previous<br>
methods. It is important to note that oxidation of the hydrolysate solution in the present<br>
method does not produce an organic layer thereby precluding the need to for an initial<br>
oxidation step comprising a first oxidant.<br>
Accordingly, a hydrolysate solution, oxidant, metal catalyst, and pH adjusting<br>
species may be disposed in a first treatment tank. Oxidants, metal catalysts, and pH<br>
adjusting chemical species suitable for the oxidation process of the present method are<br>
similar to those described for the oxidation of the aqueous organophosphorus<br>
concentration in the preceding methods. Suitable oxidants for the present method, for<br>
example, are similar those which may serve as a second oxidant in the preceding methods<br>
and comprise peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide and ozone, oxygen, air, and<br>
hypochlorite. The oxidant is utilized in conjunction with a metal catalyst such as iron.<br>
The oxidant may be added in a stiochiometric amount to oxidize substantially all<br>
of the organophosphorus concentration in the hydrolysate solution. The molar ratio of<br>
the oxidizing agent to the organophosphorus concentration may range from about 1 to 1<br>
to about 40 to 1. Moreover, the stoichiometric amount of metal catalyst added to the<br>
hydrolysate solution may be sufficient to produce a molar ratio of metal catalyst to<br>
orgnophosphorus-concentration ranging from about 0.5 to 1 to about 3 to 1.<br>
A pH adjusting chemical species may be added to the hydrolysate solution in a<br>
sufficient amount to adjust the pH of the solution to reside with a pH range from about<br>
4.5 to about 6.0.<br>
The oxidant, metal catalyst, and pH adjusting species are mixed with the<br>
hydrolysate solution in the first treatment tank by stirring, and the resulting solution may<br>
be allowed to sit for a time period during which oxidation may occur.    In some<br><br>
embodiments, depending on the concentration of the chemical agent hydrolysate, the time<br>
period for oxidation of the hydrolysate solution may range from about 15 minutes to<br>
about 10 hours. In the oxidation reaction, the organophosphorus concentration is<br>
oxidized to methyl-phosphonic acid (MPA) and ortho-phosphorus (PO43). As previously<br>
described, MPA and ortho-phosphorus are susceptible to precipitation from an aqueous<br>
mixture of as iron-phosphorus polymers. As a result, when iron is present in the<br>
hydrolysate solution, the MPA and ortho-phosphorus produced in the oxidation of the<br>
hydrolysate solution may precipitate as an iron-phosphorus polymer. In other<br>
embodiments, additional trivalent iron may be introduced into the first treatment tank<br>
after oxidation to precipitate further amounts of MPA and ortho-phosphorus as iron-<br>
phosphorus polymer.<br>
The resulting iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate may be separated from the<br>
hydrolysate solution in the first treatment tank by filtration or any other means known to<br>
one or ordinary skill in the art. Once separated, the iron-phosphorus polymer precipitate<br>
may be combined with other solid waste such as plant material and safely disposed of in a<br>
landfill. The removal of the iron-phosphorus polymer generates a depleted<br>
organophosphorus aqueous layer and renders organophosphorus precursors of a chemical<br>
agent hydrolysate incapable of reforming the chemical agent.<br>
The organophosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution may subsequently proceed<br>
to a pre-bioreactor equalization tank for biodegradation. In biodegrading the<br>
organophosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution, the pH of the hydrolysate solution is<br>
adjusted to reside within a range from about 6 to 8. The organophosphorus hydrolysate<br>
solution may be combined with plant and/or other organic material and subsequently<br>
biodegraded. The biodegraded organophosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution may be<br>
discharged into a body of water such as a publicly owned treatment works or may be<br>
disposed of in any other manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, before biodegradation, the organophosphorus depleted<br>
hydrolysate solution may be combined with other waste streams comprising biologically<br>
degradable compounds.<br><br>
About 3.8 liters (one gallon) of VX hydrolysate comprising 10% VX load [1 M<br>
thiolamine, 1 M phosphonates (EMPA and MPA)] and a pH of 14 is disposed in a first<br>
treatment tank or reaction vessel. The VX hydrolysate is stirred, and about 230 mL of<br>
50% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is added to oxidize the VX hydrolysate in the first<br>
treatment tank. The oxidation of the VX hydrolysate produces an aqueous layer<br>
comprising an organophosphorus concentration and an organic layer comprising an<br>
organosulfur concentration. In the present example, the organic layer is not separated<br>
from the aqueous layer.<br>
The pH of the oxidized, hydrolysate solution is adjusted to a value of about 8 with<br>
the addition of about 270 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. The hydrolysate solution is<br>
then subjected to a second oxidation. In the oxidation process, about 4 liters of 5-7%<br>
aqueous iron as FeS04 * 7H2O is added to the solution. The pH of the hydrolysate<br>
solution is further adjusted to about 6 with concentrated sulfuric acid. The solution is<br>
heated to 50°C and about 8 liters of 50% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is added to the<br>
hydrolysate solution over a 4 hour period. The pH of the solution is maintained at a pH<br>
of 5 with 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and the temperature of the hydrolysate solution<br>
is maintained between 60°C and 90°C over the course of the oxidation. The hydrolysate<br>
solution is allowed to cool for 1 hour.<br>
The resulting phosphorus containing precipitate is filtered from the solution with<br>
a filter press. The phosphorus containing precipitate is disposed of accordingly. The<br>
ammonia concentration of the phosphorus-depleted hydrolysate solution is stripped from<br>
the solution. The pH of the phosphorus depleted hydrolysate solution is adjusted to a<br>
value of 12 with 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Generally, the addition of about 500<br>
mL of NaOH is required to adjust the pH of the solution to a value of 12. The<br>
hydrolysate solution is subsequently sparged with air until ammonia specifications are<br>
met (about 2 h to 50 mg/L).<br>
The phosphorus-depleted solution is blended with plant flow such that the total<br>
dissolved solids (TDS) level is less than 3%. The blended solution is added to an<br>
acclimated, aerated sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The microorganism ratio<br>
(TOC:MLSS) in the SBR is about equal to 0.2 wherein TOC = total organic carbon and<br><br>
MLSS = mixed liquor suspended solids. The blended phosphorus-depleted solution is<br>
biodegraded and the resulting effluent is discharged from the biological treatment system.<br>
The effluent is discharged at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of about 10 days. The<br>
effluent may be polished if necessary to meet permit requirements. Settled solids may be<br>
discharged at a solids-retention time (SRT) of about 50 days.<br>

Treatment Process (in Percent)<br><br>
Table 1 displays the results of treatment of a VX hydrolysate according to a<br>
method of the present invention. As illustrated in Table 1, the organophosphorus<br>
concentration of the hydrolysate is significantly reduced thereby rendering the<br>
organophosphorus precursors inoperable to recombine with other chemical species in the<br>
hydrolysate to reform the chemical agent.<br>
