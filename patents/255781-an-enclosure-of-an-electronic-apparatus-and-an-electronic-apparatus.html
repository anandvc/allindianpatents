ELECTRONIC APPARATUS AND ENCLOSURE EMPLOYING<br>
SUBSTANTIALLY CO-PLANAR PORTIONS<br>
WITH MATING CRENELLATIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to enclosures for electronic apparatus and, more<br>
particularly, to such enclosures that reduce electromagnetic interference emissions to<br>
and/or from the enclosures. The invention also relates to electronic apparatus<br>
employing enclosures that reduce electromagnetic interference emissions thereto<br>
and/or therefrom.<br>
Background Information<br>
The operation of electronic apparatus (e.g., without limitation,<br>
electronic equipment; electronic devices; televisions; radios; computers; medical and<br>
other electronic instruments; business machines; communications devices; control<br>
and/or monitoring devices) is attended by the generation of electromagnetic radiation<br>
within the electronic circuitry of the apparatus. Such radiation often develops as a<br>
field or as transients within the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum<br>
(e.g., between about 10 KHz and 10 GHz), and is termed "electromagnetic<br>
interference" (EMI), which is known to interfere with the operation of other<br>
proximate electronic devices. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,202,536;<br>
5,142,101; 5,105,056; and 4,857,668.<br>
Digital and/or processor-based electronic devices produce<br>
electromagnetic fields at harmonics of the clock frequency and also at frequencies<br>
related to the rise and fall times of logic signals. The most straightforward controls<br>
for EMI involve the use of multi-layer printed circuit boards and ground planes.<br>
Nevertheless, emissions can easily exceed regulatory requirements.<br>
The last line of defense is the electronic enclosure. To reduce<br>
electromagnetic emissions, the typical electronic enclosure is made of conductive<br>
materials, such as aluminum or steel. Even then, any openings or seams may act as<br>
slot antennas. These slots pass EMI at frequencies having wavelengths less than eight<br>
times the size of the slot. To attenuate EMI effects, shielding having the capability of<br>
absorbing and/or reflecting EMI energy may be employed both to confine the EMI<br><br>
energy within a source device, and to insulate that device or other "target" devices<br>
from other source devices. Such shielding is provided as a barrier, which is inserted<br>
between the source and the other devices, and typically is configured as an electrically<br>
conductive and grounded housing to enclose the device.<br>
As the circuitry of the electronic device generally must remain<br>
accessible for servicing or the like, most housings are provided with openable or<br>
removable accesses, such as doors, hatches, panels or covers. Between even the<br>
flattest of these accesses and its corresponding mating or faying surface, however,<br>
there may be present gaps, which reduce the efficiency of the shielding by presenting<br>
openings through which radiant energy may leak or otherwise pass into or out of the<br>
device. Moreover, such gaps represent discontinuities in the surface and ground<br>
conductivity of the housing or other shielding, and may even generate a secondary<br>
source of EMI radiation by functioning as a form of slot antenna. In this regard, bulk<br>
or surface currents induced within the housing develop voltage gradients across any<br>
interface gaps in the shielding, which gaps thereby function as antennas and radiate<br>
EMI noise. In general, the amplitude of the noise is proportional to the gap length,<br>
with the width of the gap having a relatively smaller effect.<br>
To address EMI, EMI shielding products attempt to prevent undesired<br>
electromagnetic energy and radio frequency interference (RFI) from disrupting, or<br>
radiating from, electronic devices. Such products include, for example, wire mesh O-<br>
rings; fabric-over-foam profile gaskets; shielding tapes; fabric-over-foam I/O gaskets;<br>
cable shielding; EMI shielding glass; shielding laminates; selectively coated, custom<br>
formable shields; beryllium copper spring-finger gasketing; and silver coated nylon<br>
gasketing. Nevertheless, such products are expensive.<br>
One example of an electronic device is the personal computer (PC). In<br>
order to attenuate electromagnetic signals, the typical PC case includes steel plates<br>
and shields; nevertheless, there are emissions through the seams and through openings<br>
created for add-on cards. In some applications, electromagnetic gasket material<br>
attempts to attenuate non-complaint signals at the seams and the openings. The more<br>
overlap provided by the gasket material at a seam or opening, the better the<br>
attenuation. However, the cost of the gasket material and related assembly is<br>
relatively expensive.<br><br>
In a microwave oven, for example, the wavelengths of signals are<br>
relatively very short. Hence, such microwave ovens employ electromagnetic gaskets<br>
for relatively long seams and an array of relatively small holes in a conductive panel<br>
for the window.<br>
For filling gaps within mating surfaces of housings and other EMI<br>
shielding structures, gaskets and other seals have been proposed for maintaining<br>
electrical continuity across the structure. Such seals are bonded or mechanically<br>
attached to, or press-fit into, one of the mating surfaces, and close any interface gaps,<br>
in order to establish a continuous electrically conductive path thereacross by<br>
conforming under an applied pressure to irregularities between the surfaces.<br>
EMI shielding gaskets, for example, are used in electronic equipment<br>
to provide protection against interference from electromagnetic energy, including RFI<br>
and more broadly all bands of EMI. The shielding has an electrically conductive<br>
element, be it a wire mesh, conductive filler or conductive plating, coating or fabric,<br>
which prevents external EMI from interfering with an electronic device and/or<br>
protects other adjacent electronic devices from EMI emitted by an electronic device.<br>
The Background of the Invention section of U.S. Patent No. 6,521,828<br>
discloses a form-in-place (FTP) process for the manufacture of EMI shielding gaskets.<br>
One method of achieving a lower closure force gasket design has been to form the<br>
gasket as having a periodic "interrupted" pattern of alternating local maxima and<br>
minima heights. Gaskets of such type may be formed by molding or the FIP process<br>
as having a crenellated, i.e., notched, serrated or a sinusoidal "waveform" profile, or<br>
as a series of discrete beads. In general, for a specified joint configuration, a gasket<br>
having such an "interrupted" profile or pattern would be expected to exhibit a greater<br>
deflection under a given compressive load than a continuous profile.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,259,792 discloses an electrical connector housing for<br>
a flat ribbon-type electrical transmission cable and method for minimizing EMI<br>
emissions. The connector housing has a top half and a bottom half, which are fitted<br>
together with an interlock joint, in order to minimize the emission of EMI through the<br>
joint. The interlock is provided by a number of interrupt elements that provide<br>
discontinuity along the otherwise continuous line joint to minimize the emissions of<br>
interference signals. Preferably, the interlock along the interface between the top and<br><br>
bottom connector housing halves is provided by serrations in the form of triangular<br>
teeth that fit together. The teeth interlock, in order that there is insufficient space to<br>
allow for the transmission of EMI at frequencies at least up to six gigahertz.<br>
However, the interrupt may be provided in the form of other elements as long as there<br>
is no space having a linear dimension greater than 1/8 of the EMI wavelength. The<br>
plastic housing halves are plated with a metal plating shield, such as a copper-nickel<br>
alloy, to provide shielding. Also, RFI shielding strips are affixed to each housing<br>
half, in order that when the housing halves are clamped together the shielding strips<br>
will make positive electrical contact with a cable foil metal shield.<br>
Military contractors have used many techniques to attenuate and<br>
deflect radar signals. For example, the goal of stealth technology is to make an<br>
aircraft invisible to radar. The stealth aircraft is shaped, in order that any incident<br>
radar signals are reflected away from the radar source and/or the aircraft is covered in<br>
materials that absorb radar signals. For example, the stealth aircraft may be made up<br>
of completely flat surfaces and relatively very sharp edges. When a radar signal hits a<br>
stealth aircraft, the signal reflects away at an angle. In contrast, most conventional<br>
aircraft have a rounded shape, which creates a very efficient radar reflector, thereby<br>
reflecting some of the signal back to the source.<br>
There is room for improvement in electronic apparatus and enclosures<br>
therefor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These needs and others are met by the present invention, which<br>
employs first and second enclosure portions to form an interface joint. The first and<br>
second enclosure portions are at least substantially co-planar proximate the interface<br>
joint and include a plurality of mating crenellations. This limits the size of enclosure<br>
slots at the interface joint in any particular direction.<br>
As one aspect of the invention, an electronic apparatus comprises: an<br>
enclosure including a first enclosure portion and a second enclosure portion; and<br>
electronic circuitry within the enclosure, the second enclosure portion mating with the<br>
first enclosure portion and forming an interface joint, the first and second enclosure<br>
portions being at least substantially co-planar proximate the interface joint and including a plurality of mating crenellations, in order to reduce electromagnetic<br><br>
interference radiation to or from the enclosure when the first and second enclosure<br>
portions are mated together.<br>
The mating crenellations may be a series of mating serrations<br>
extending along the interface joint. The first and second enclosure portions may<br>
include co-planar mating portions, which form the interface joint. The mating<br>
crenellations may be a series of mating serrated teeth extending along the interface<br>
joint.<br>
The first enclosure portion may be a housing including an opening and<br>
an edge with a first set of the mating crenellations defining the opening. The second<br>
enclosure portion may be a plate having a periphery with a second set of the mating<br>
crenellations within the opening. The first and second sets of the mating crenellations<br>
may mate and define the interface joint.<br>
As another aspect of the invention, an electronic apparatus enclosure<br>
comprises: a first enclosure portion adapted to house electronic circuitry therein; and a<br>
second enclosure portion mating with the first enclosure portion and forming an<br>
interface joint, the first and second enclosure portions being at least substantially co-<br>
planar proximate the interface joint and including a plurality of mating crenellations,<br>
in order to reduce electromagnetic interference radiation to or from the enclosure<br>
when the first and second enclosure portions are mated together.<br>
The first enclosure portion may be a housing including an opening and<br>
an edge with a first set of the mating crenellations at the opening. The second<br>
enclosure portion may be a plate having a periphery with a second set of the mating<br>
crenellations within the opening. The first and second sets of the mating crenellations<br>
may be co-planar and mate to define the interface joint.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 shows an electronic device 2 including a housing 4 and<br>
electronic circuitry 6 (shown in hidden line drawing) therein. The housing 4 includes<br>
a generally five-sided enclosure 8 and two front plates 10,12 having a plurality of<br>
connectors 14,16, respectively. The front plates 10,12 mate with the enclosure 8 at<br>
two openings 18,20, respectively, thereof. The front plates 10,12 and respective<br>
openings 18,20 form eight slotted joints 22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36. The front surface<br>
38 of the housing 4, including the front plates 10,12 and the front surface 40 of the<br>
enclosure 8 is generally planar. The front plates 10,12 are secured to the enclosure 8<br>
by suitable fasteners 42.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, an electronic apparatus 50 includes an enclosure<br>
52 having a first enclosure portion 54 and two second enclosure portions 56,57, and<br>
electronic circuitry 58 (e.g., meter circuitry) (shown in hidden line drawing) within<br>
the enclosure 52. The second enclosure portions 56,57 mate with the first enclosure<br>
portion 54 and form two interface joints 59,60, respectively. The first and second<br>
enclosure portions 54,56,57 are at least substantially co-planar proximate the interface<br>
joints 59,60 and include a plurality of mating crenellations 62,63 (as shown with the<br>
portion 56), in order to reduce electromagnetic interference radiation to or from the<br>
enclosure 52 when the first and second enclosure portions 54,56,57 are mated<br>
together. The mating crenellations 62,63 are a series of mating serrations 64,65 (e.g.,<br>
mating serrated teeth) extending along the interface joints 59,60. The first and second<br>
enclosure portions 54,56,57 include co-planar mating portions 66,67,68, which form<br>
the interface joints 59,60.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, rather than the relatively long slotted openings<br>
18,20 of Figure 1, the interface joints 59,60 employ a series of the mating serrations<br>
64,65. In this manner, only EMI at frequencies having wavelengths less than eight<br><br>
times the size of each of the mating serrations 64,65 can pass therethrough without<br>
being filtered.<br>
Examples of the meter circuitry 58 are disclosed, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,890,097; 5,754,440; 5,706,204; and 5,661,658, which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Although example meter circuitry 58 is disclosed, the invention is<br>
applicable to any suitable electronic circuitry within the enclosure 52.<br>
In this example, the first enclosure portion 54 is a generally five-sided<br>
housing including two openings 70,72 having edges 74,76 with the mating<br>
crenellations 62. The second enclosure portions 56,57 are front plates having<br>
peripheries 78,80 with the mating crenellations 63 within the openings 70,72. The<br>
mating crenellations 62,63 of the co-planar mating portions 66,67,68 are co-planar<br>
and mate to define the interface joints 59,60.<br>
Although two openings 70,72, two front plates 56,57 and two interface<br>
joints 59,60 are shown, the invention is applicable to enclosures including a single<br>
interface joint having one or more longitudinal edges with mating crenellations.<br>
Although front plates 56,57 are shown, the invention is applicable to one or more<br>
interface joints disposed on any side(s) of an enclosure.<br>
One or more connectors are operatively associated with the meter<br>
circuitry 58 on one or both of the front plates 56,57. For example, the meter circuitry<br>
58 may include one or more printed circuit boards (not shown) electrically and<br>
mechanically interfacing the connectors. Examples of such connectors include an<br>
input connector 82, an output connector 84, an input/output connector 86, an RS-485<br>
connector 88, a serial port connector 90, an Ethernet connector 92, a telephone<br>
connector 94, a power supply connector 96, a terminal block 98 and a USB port<br>
connector 100.<br>
Any inputs and/or outputs (e.g., connections<br>
82,84,86,88,90,92,94,96,98,100), if employed, preferably include shielded cables and<br>
shielded connectors, especially if the corresponding inputs and/or outputs do not have<br>
a suitably high impedance.<br>
The electromagnetic interference radiation 101 internal to the<br>
enclosure 52 and the electromagnetic interference radiation 102 external to the<br>
enclosure 52 have frequencies and corresponding wavelengths. The mating<br><br>
crenellations 62,63 define miniature slots along the interface joints 59,60. The length<br>
of those slots is less than a predetermined fraction {e.g., 1/8) of the wavelength. For<br>
example, from the well known equation λ= c/f, wherein λ is wavelength, c is the<br>
speed of light (= 3.0 x 108 m/s x 39.37 in./m) in a vacuum and f is frequency, if the<br>
slot length is desired to be less than 1/8 of the wavelength of a selected frequency,<br>
such as 6 GHz, then the maximum slot length (i.e., the maximum length of any of the<br>
individual serrated edges of the interface joints 59,60) would be about 0.25 in. If the<br>
length of the slots is 1/8 of a selected wavelength {e.g., λ), then relatively smaller<br>
wavelengths {i.e., 2λ) greater than twice the<br>
selected wavelength are filtered, and intermediate wavelengths {i.e., between λ and<br>
2λ) are somewhat filtered.<br>
Although serrated edges of the interface joints 59,60 are shown in<br>
Figure 2, a wide range of other suitable crenellated edges may be employed. For<br>
example, the interface joints may employ notches (Figure 3) or embrasures (Figure 4).<br>
Such crenellated edges may be formed by any suitable process, such as, for example,<br>
stamping or routing.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, two mating enclosure portions 103,104 form, in<br>
the manner of a battlement, an interface joint 105 including alternating openings, such<br>
as notched recesses or embrasures 106, and raised sections, such as notched<br>
projections or merlons 108, extending along that interface joint. These mating<br>
crenellations form an irregular square wave pattern. Although a somewhat irregular<br>
pattern of embrasures 106 and merlons 108 is shown, such a pattern may be irregular<br>
or regular {e.g., a notched or square wave pattern having, for example, a 50% or other<br>
suitable duty cycle). Here, the mating enclosure portions 103,104 are preferably co-<br>
planar.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, two mating enclosure portions 110,112 employ<br>
mating embrasures 114,116 to define an interface joint 118.<br>
The electronic equipment enclosure 52 of Figure 2 employs an<br>
improved structure, which replaces a conventional slotted opening with an interface<br>
joint, such as 59 or 60, having a plurality of mating crenellations 62,63, in order to<br>
reduce emissions of interference radiation 101,102 to or from the enclosure 52. These<br>
mating crenellations 62,63 directly limit the size of the enclosure slots in any<br><br>
particular direction. The disclosed mating crenellations 62,63, 106,108, 114,116 and<br>
124,126 minimize emissions of electromagnetic interference radiation to or from an<br>
enclosure, such as 52.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in<br>
detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
. alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the<br>
disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be<br>
illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given<br>
the full breadth of the claims appended and any and all equivalents thereof.<br><br>
