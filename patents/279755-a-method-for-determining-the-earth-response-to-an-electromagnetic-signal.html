				<td>IMPROVEMENTS IN MARINE KM EXPLORATION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for removing the airwave from marine<br>
electromagnetic data. In particular, the invention relates to a technique for reducing<br>
the impact of the airwave in marine based multi-channel transient electromagnetic<br>
(MTEM) measurements.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Porous rocks are saturated with fluids. The fluids may be water, gas, or oil, or a<br>
mixture of all three. The flow of current in the earth is determined by the resistivities<br>
of such rocks, which are affected by the saturating fluids. For instance, brine-<br>
saturated porous rocks are much less resistive than the same rocks filled with<br>
hydrocarbons. By measuring the resistivity of geological formations, hydrocarbons<br>
can be detected. Hence, resistivity measurements can be made in an exploration<br>
phase to detect hydrocarbons prior to drilling.<br>
Various techniques for measuring the resistivity of geological formations are known,<br>
for example time domain electromagnetic techniques, as described in WO 03/023452,<br>
the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Conventionally, time<br>
domain electromagnetic investigations use a transmitter and one or more receivers.<br>
The transmitter may be an electric source, that is, a grounded bipole, or a magnetic<br>
source, that is, a current in a wire loop or multi-loop. The receivers may be grounded<br>
bipoles for measuring potential differences, or wire loops or multi-loops or<br>
magnetometers for measuring magnetic fields and/or the time derivatives of magnetic<br>
fields. The transmitted signal is often formed by a step change in current in either an<br>
electric or magnetic source, but any transient signal may be used, including, for<br>
example, a pseudo-random binary sequence. Measurements can be taken on land or<br>
in an underwater environment.<br>
Figure 1 shows a view of a typical setup for transient electromagnetic marine<br>
surveying. This has a bi-pole current source with mid-point xs on or near the sea floor<br>
for transmitting a transient current between two electrodes. The time function of the<br>
current might be a simple step change in current or a more complicated signal such as<br>
 <br>
a pseudo-random binary sequence. The response of the earth-water system is<br>
measured by a line of bi-pole receivers on or near the sea floor, each receiver<br>
characterised by its mid-point position xr and measuring the potential difference<br>
between a pair of electrodes. All the electrodes are essentially in the same vertical<br>
plane.<br>
In use, the electromagnetic signal generated by the source of Figure 1 can follow three<br>
transmission paths to the receiver electrodes, these being directly through the earth,<br>
directly through the water, and via the water through the air and back through the<br>
water again. The signal transmitted by this third path is known as the airwave. In<br>
deep water, the airwave has a negligible impact. In contrast in shallow water, the<br>
signal (hat is transmitted through the water is negligible, but the airwave can have a<br>
significant impact and so make interpretation of the data difficult.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, mere is provided a method for<br>
removing the effects of an airwave from marine electromagnetic data comprising<br>
providing a source and at least one receiver in the water; measuring the<br>
electromagnetic response at a first source-receiver separation; determining a scaled<br>
version of the airwave response at a source-receiver separation where the earth<br>
response is negligible and using the scaled airwave response to determine the earth<br>
response measured at the first separation. The step of determining the scaled airwave<br>
may involve measuring or estimating the airwave response.<br>
For an impulsive source current, the airwave response decays approximately as the<br>
cube of the source-receiver separation at separations large compared with the water<br>
depth, whereas the response of the component travelling directly through the earth<br>
decays approximately as the fifth power of the source-receiver separation. At very<br>
large offsets, therefore, the airwave dominates the total response. Hence, by<br>
measuring the electromagnetic response at a large source-receiver separation where<br>
the earth response is negligible, a measure of the airwave at that source receiver<br>
separation can be determined. This is a scaled version of the airwave response at the<br>
first source-receiver measurement separation, and can be used to allow removal of the<br>
 <br>
airwave from the measured data and consequently a more accurate measure of the<br>
earth response at the first source-receiver separation.<br>
Using the scaled airwave response to determine the earth response may involve<br>
finding an inverse filter f(t) of the scaled airwave response a(t); convolving the<br>
inverse filter f(t) with the measured data x(t) to compress the airwave to an<br>
impulse; removing the airwave impulse from the result of the convolution with the air<br>
wave data and convolving the result with the scaled determined airwave a(t) to<br>
recover the earth response without the airwave.<br>
Preferably, the source is a current bi-pole or a magnetic loop. Preferably, the receiver<br>
is a bi-pole receiver or a magnetic loop. Preferably, the source and receiver are<br>
located on or near the seabed.<br>
The electromagnetic measurements are transient electromagnetic measurements; that<br>
is, the response to the input signal at the source must have reached essentially steady<br>
state before the measurement is complete.<br>
Preferably, the larger source-receiver separation is approximately five or more times<br>
greater than the shorter separation. Ideally, both source-receiver separations are at<br>
least five times greater than the depth of the water.<br>
The larger source-receiver separation is selected so that the earth response measured<br>
at the receiver is substantially zero.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a computer<br>
program, preferably on a computer readable medium or data carrier, for removing the<br>
effects of an airwave from marine electromagnetic data as measured by at least one<br>
source and at least one receiver, the computer program having code or instructions for<br>
using an airwave response at a source-receiver separation where the earth response is<br>
negligible to allow removal of an airwave response in measurements at a shorter<br>
source-receiver separation, thereby to allow the earth response to be determined.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the larger separation is approximately five or more tiroes greater than the<br>
shorter separation.<br>
Preferably, the larger separation is selected so that the earth response measured at the<br>
receiver is substantially zero.<br>
Preferably, the program has code or instructions for subtracting the determined<br>
airwave from the measurement at the shorter separation.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a system for<br>
deterrnining the earth response to an electromagnetic signal using an electromagnetic<br>
source and at least one receiver in water, the system being adapted to measure the<br>
electromagnetic response at a first source-receiver separation; determine the airwave<br>
response or a scaled version thereof at a source-receiver separation where the earth<br>
response is negligible and use the determined airwave response to determine the earth<br>
response measured at the first separation.<br>
The system may be adapted to use the airwave response to determine the earth<br>
response involves finding an inverse filter f (f) of the scaled airwave response a(t);<br>
convolve the filter f(t) with the measured response at the first source-receiver<br>
separation to provide a result that includes an airwave impulse; remove the airwave<br>
impulse from the result of the convolution and convolve the remainder with the<br>
determined airwave response a(t) to recover the earth response at the first source-<br>
receiver separation without the airwave.<br>
A system may be adapted to determine the earth response by measuring or estimating<br>
the airwave response.<br>
The larger separation may be approximately five or more times greater than the<br>
shorter separation. Both separations may be at least five times greater than the depth<br>
of the water.<br>
 <br>
The larger separation may be selected so that the earth response measured at the<br>
receiver is substantially zero.<br>
The source may be a current bi-pole or a magnetic loop. The receiver may be a bi-<br>
pole receiver or a magnetic loop.<br>
The source and receiver may be located on or near the seabed.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
of measuring an electromagnetic response, the method comprising positioning an<br>
electromagnetic source and at least one electromagnetic receiver underwater;<br>
transmitting an electromagnetic signal from the source to the receiver, wherein the<br>
transmitted signal comprises an earth component and an airwave component, and the<br>
receiver is positioned relative to the source so that the measured response is<br>
substantially due to the airwave.<br>
In any aspect of the invention, the transmitted signal may be formed by a step change<br>
in current in either an electric or magnetic source, although any transient signal may<br>
be used, including, for example, a pseudo-random binary sequence.<br>

Figure 5 shows the marine impulse response, the earth impulse response and<br>

 <br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention provides a method for removing the effects of an airwave from<br>
shallow water marine electromagnetic data. The invention will be illustrated using the<br>
model of Figure 2, which shows a seawater layer of depth d and resistivity pw<br>
overlying a homogeneous isotropic halfspace. The dipole source is on the sea floor<br>
and the in-line electric field is calculated at a receiver position at some offset r from it<br>
on the sea floor. For the sake of example, it will be assumed that the water layer is<br>
100 m deep and has a resistivity of 0.3 ohm-m, and the half space has a resistivity of<br>
lohm-m.<br>
Figure 3 shows an impulse response at 2 km for the arrangement of Figure 2. Figure<br>
3(a) shows the response out to 9 s, and Figure 3(b) shows it out to 1 s. A sharp initial<br>
peak occurs at 0.008 s and has an amplitude of 1.82E-10 V/m/s. This is the airwave.<br>
This has a finite rise time to the peak and a long tail. There is a second much broader<br>
peak at about 0.45 s with an amplitude of 2.4E-11 V/m/s. This is caused by the earth<br>
response. The objective is to separate the airwave and the earth impulse response.<br>
At a given offset and after deconvolution for the system response, the impulse<br>
response data, which are causal, can be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
in which a(t) is the air wave and g(t) is the earth impulse response, with g(0) = 0.<br>
Suitable deconvolution techniques are described for example by Wright, D., et al in<br>
the article Hydrocarbon detection and monitoring with a multichannel transient<br>
electromagnetic (MTEM) survey: The Leading Edge, 21, 852-864.<br>
The airwave is expected to be minimum-phase. By this it is meant that without the<br>
water the airwave is an impulse and the propagation effects in the water must be<br>
factors involving decaying exponentials, which are minimum-phase.<br>
 <br>
An estimate a(t) of the air wave is assumed such that<br>
 <br>
This is an estimate of the shape, but the exact airwave amplitude A is not known.<br>
Next a filter f(t) has to be found, such that<br>
 <br>
in which the asterisk denotes convolution and δ(t) is the impulse function:<br>
 <br>
As mentioned above a(t) and hence a(t) are expected to be minimum-phase.<br>
Therefore the inverse f(t) is causal, realizable and minimum-phase; that is, it exists<br>
only for t ≥ 0, and it has finite amplitude.<br>
Convolving the filter f (t) with the data yields<br>
 <br>
Now the airwave is removed by considering only t &gt; 0, so that:<br>
 <br>
This result can then be convolved with a(t):<br>
 <br>
 <br>
This allows the earth impulse as measured to be recovered, but without the airwave.<br>
This is what is needed, and it turns out that the unknown amplitude factor A is<br>
irrelevant. Hence, by merely having an estimate or measure of the shape of the<br>
airwave, the earth impulse can be determined.<br>
Because of the presence of noise, an exact inverse of a(t) cannot be used. First<br>
equation (1) is re-written to include the noise:<br>
 <br>
Then equation (2) is modified to define a new filter f1(t), such that<br>
 <br>
in which d(t) is a band-limited impulse whose integral is unity, for example a<br>
Gaussian, of the form d(t) - αexp(-πα2t2) with α a frequency close to the highest<br>
frequency of interest in the data, and t is a time delay introduced to make /,(r)<br>
causal. The integral of d(t) is 1. Convolving this filter with the data yields<br>
 <br>
The value of α is chosen to be as large as possible but not so large that the high<br>
frequency components of the noise are amplified too much. Then<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Apart from the known time delay t this is what is desired, plus noise. The time delay<br>
can easily be removed.<br>
The shape of the airwave can be estimated by looking at an offset that is large<br>
compared with this offset and where the attenuation of the earth response is relatively<br>
high. It is suspected that the shape of the airwave is invariant with offset for a 1-D<br>
earth - beyond a certain offset ~ and the hypothesis is that an almost pure airwave<br>
could be measured, if the offset is large enough and the time window restricted. This<br>
gives an estimate of the shape of the airwave, which according to the method<br>
described above would allow the effects of the airwave at the measurement source-<br>
receiver separations to be removed.<br>
Figure 4 shows the impulse response at 10 km offset for a lohm-m half space beneath<br>
100 m of water, where the dipole source and receiver are on the sea floor. Figure 4 (a)<br>
shows the response out to 9 s, and Figure 4 (b) shows it out to 1 s. The sharp initial<br>
peak occurs at 0.008 s and has an amplitude of 1.46E-12 V/m/s. There is no<br>
discernible second peak. It should be noted that the peak of the airwave occurs at<br>
exactly the same time as for the 2 km impulse response.<br>
Figure 5 shows the marine impulse response, the earth impulse response and the<br>
airwave for a 2 km offset measurement. The earth impulse response was obtained<br>
 <br>
according to the scheme described above; the airwave was obtained by subtracting the.<br>
earth impulse response from the marine impulse response. A measure of the quality<br>
of this result is to compare the recovered impulse response with the analytic function:<br>
the impulse response of a lohm-m half space at an offset of 2 km. Figure 6 shows the<br>
result of removing the airwave from the impulse responses shown in Figure 3. This is<br>
very similar to the analytic function for the impulse response of a lohm-m half space.<br>
In particular the time and amplitude of the peak of the two functions are in close<br>
agreement.<br>
The present invention provides a very simple and effective technique for removing the<br>
airwave from measured MTEM data. This can be summarised as follows: estimate<br>
the shape of the airwave using an airwave at a large source-receiver separation and<br>
find a filter f(t) based on the estimated airwave. This filter is then convolved with the<br>
measured data x(t). The result of this is very messy data, but there is a very sharp<br>
peak at time t = t. This is the airwave. The airwave peak is then sliced out. The<br>
remaining data is returned to its original state by convolving it with the scaled airwave<br>
a(t). This operation undoes the effect of convolving with the filter f(t). The result is<br>
the original data, i.e. the earth response, without the airwave.<br>
The data captured may be processed in accordance with the invention using any<br>
suitable hardware or software.<br>
A skilled person will appreciate that variations of the disclosed arrangements are<br>
possible without departing from the invention. Accordingly the above description of<br>
the specific embodiment is made by way of example only and not for the purposes of<br>
limitation. It will be clear to the skilled person that minor modifications may be made<br>
without significant changes to the operation described.<br>

A method for removing the effects of an airwave from marine electromagnetic data comprising providing an electro-magnetic source and at least one receiver in the water; measuring the electromagnetic response at a first source-receiver separation; determining a scaled version of the airwave response at a source-receiver separation where the earth response is negligible and using the scaled airwave response to determine the earth response measured at the first separation. Using this method, an improved<br>
estimate of the earth's response can be achieved.</td>
