				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention:-<br>
The invention relates to potential transformers in general, and to a high<br>
impedance high voltage winding of potential transformer for AC transmission systems in<br>
particular.<br>
Background and prior art:-<br>
A potential transformer (PT) is primarily used to measure system voltage and provides<br>
proportional signals for metering and protection. A PT is in general connected at<br>
receiving side (incomer), load side (feeder) or substation bus bar.<br>
Inductive voltage/ potential transformers are used to measure voltage in electric<br>
circuits. A potential transformer is a conventional step down transformer having primary<br>
and secondary windings. The primary winding is connected directly to the power circuit<br>
either between two phases or between one phase and ground depending on system<br>
configuration. Their main role is to condition (step down) the voltage to be measured<br>
by a measuring instrument/device. The transformer acts as an electrical isolation<br>
between instrumentation and the power system. The proportional secondary voltage is<br>
expected to be in phase with primary voltage for accuracy of three-phase measurement<br>
and the protection. To maintain precise voltage regulation, instrumentation load on PTs'<br>
is kept to bare minimum. The PTs are designed with high input impedance to avoid<br>
system loading.<br>
During evaluation and type testing of these devices, at higher voltages i.e., 110% and<br>
125% of rated voltages specified by IEC, temperature of winding increases close to<br>
levels specified signifying a scope for improvement in material and optimization.<br>
Further, because of the low resistance of windings, the over-voltages which are<br>
encountered during switching/ ferro-resonance (due to inductance of PT and<br><br>
capacitance of long cables/transmissions lines) persist for longer durations for low<br>
clamping coefficient of the network, damaging equipment and insulation.<br>
In conventional potential transformers, high conductivity material like copper is used for<br>
preparation of primary and secondary windings. Because of low resistance of these<br>
windings, dc current flow in primary and secondary windings is abnormally high for<br>
higher system voltages. The ac magnetizing currents also have higher magnitude for<br>
reduced overall impedance. These flaws are conventionally controlled by use of current<br>
limiters. More clearly, a fuse or current limiter (CL) is often connected in series with<br>
primary winding of transmission PTs, for safety and ease of disconnecting the PT from<br>
the circuit (Refer Figure 1).<br>
Conventionally, for limiting ferro-resonance over voltage and their adverse effect, a<br>
limiting resistor is connected in neutral of the primary winding. Sometimes a limiting<br>
resistor connected across secondary winding of the PT helps in ferro-resonance<br>
damping (Refer Figure 2). Such resistors may cause thermal damage of the potential<br>
transformer in case of sustained unbalance in the supply network. To overcome these<br>
problems, protection circuit has been employed for potential transformers (refer patent<br>
No. WO 2006/ 126904 A1). The disadvantage of such systems is that the reliability is<br>
limited by the performance of limiting resistance and protection circuit.<br>
In order to overcome above drawbacks, a high impedance high voltage winding has<br>
been proposed in the present invention for the potential transformers, which are being<br>
used for AC transmission applications.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
An object of the present invention is to reduce failure of PTs in transmission systems<br>
due to DC discharge by suitably modifying the resistive impedance of the PT.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to improve reliability by eliminating protection circuits<br>
and/or by de-rating the limiting resistor connected in neutral of the PT for ferro-<br>
resonance damping.<br>
A further object of the invention is to eliminate or to de-rate the current limiter (CL)<br>
connected in series with primary and secondary windings.<br>
Yet another object is to increase resistive impedance of the winding which enhances<br>
thermal capability of the PT.<br>
A still further object of the PT is to optimize the resistive impedance of primary winding<br>
by improving discharge capability of PT and ferro-resonance damping by keeping phase<br>
angle error and ratio errors within specified levels.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
The invention is described with the help of Figures 1 to 5, where:<br>
Figure 1: Shows the schematic of single phase potential transformer in prior art.<br>
Figure 2: Shows the schematic of three phase potential transformer in prior art.<br>
Figure 3: Shows the equivalent circuit of substation bay during DC discharge of<br>
potential transformer.<br>
Figure 4: Shows schematic of the single phase potential transformer in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
Figure 5: DC discharge capability of PT in accordance with the invention for various<br>
resistances of primary winding.<br>
The invention will now be described in details in an exemplary embodiment as depicted<br>
in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
However, there can be several other embodiments of the present invention, all of which<br>
are deemed covered by this description.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
A potential transformer (PT) is a step down transformer having primary (01) and<br>
secondary (02) windings. A limiting resistor (03) is connected in neutral of the primary<br>
winding (01) to limit ferro-resonance over voltages and their adverse effects. At times a<br>
limiting resistor (04) is connected across the secondary winding (02) to help ferro-<br>
resonance damping.<br>
In high voltage substation, if potential transformer is connected on line side terminated<br>
by high capacitance components like long transmission lines [05] which may be solid<br>
insulation cables, gas insulated transmission lines or overhead lines, it is essential for PT<br>
to have a high DC discharge capability. The capacitance of long lines is in the order of<br>
few hundred pF to few tens of μF. During opening operation circuit breaker (CB), on<br>
either side of PT, charge left on the line may appear as trapped voltage [06]. In general<br>
this DC voltage discharges through PT as its input impedance is less than the support<br>
insulators and other components of the network.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to increase the impedance of the primary winding.<br>
This is achieved primarily by increasing the resistance of the winding. It improves the<br>
DC discharge capability and ferro-resonance damping of the potential transformer.<br>
The resistance and inductance of high voltage winding depend on rated voltage of<br>
potential transformer, number of turns used, gauge/ cross section of copper wire and<br>
material characteristics. In general, the resistance of primary winding is about few kΩ<br>
and design is made based on requirements of phase angle and ratio errors. For these<br><br>
parameters of PT, the direct current (DC) discharge capability is limited. In other words,<br>
due to limited thermal rating of PT, it is prone to fail during continuous O-C-O operation<br>
of breakers (CB) present in bus and in line side of substation bay. Figure 3 shows the<br>
equivalent circuit of substation bay and its connecting line during DC discharge. For<br>
conventional PTs, OFF time required between two O-C-O operations is about few hours'<br>
for their reliable operation. This may not be acceptable for transmission applications.<br>
The OFF time can be reduced by keeping CL, however, it may lead to thermal damage<br>
of CL itself.<br>
In the present invention, the winding self resistance is increased by selecting low<br>
conductivity material for its design in comparison to high conductivity copper. Reduction<br>
in area of high conductivity copper conductor for primary winding is not recommended<br>
for practical limitations in transmissions class.<br>
The invention proposes using a special winding material/alloy which has optimal<br>
conductivity, mechanical strength and the cross-section for the application. Precisely,<br>
the copper and alloying element composition of the winding material is modified based<br>
on resistance requirement. The resistivity of winding material is increased from 2.25<br>
μΩ-cm (about 50% more than the High conductivity copper) to about 7.0 μΩ-cm<br>
(approximately 300% more than the high conductivity copper) by modifying its copper<br>
composition. Other elements, which primarily control the resistivity of the winding<br>
material is Beryllium and Nickel. In the proposed design increased impedance of the PT<br>
winding is imparted by distributed resistance [07] and distributed inductive [08]<br>
reactance due to the characteristics and length of winding material. These parameters<br>
are selected by satisfying the following conditions:<br>
1.	DC current flown through primary winding shall be as low as possible.<br>
2.	Discharge time shall be as low as possible.<br>
3.	OFF-Time shall be as low as possible.<br>
4.	Ferro-resonance damping shall be as fast as possible.<br><br>
5.	Phase angle error and ratio error shall be within specified limits.<br>
6.	Thermal rating should be as high as possible.<br>
DC current through high voltage winding is reduced by increasing resistance and<br>
inductance of winding. This helps in significant reduction of current and decrease in<br>
discharge time. The significant decrease in discharge time leads to a corresponding<br>
reduction in failure of such PTs in transmission systems, making such systems more<br>
reliable and reducing expenditure and downtime. Because of significant reduction in<br>
discharge time and current amplitude, OFF time between consecutive Open-Close-Open<br>
operations of circuit breakers(CB) can also be minimized. The ratio of resistance and<br>
inductive reactance at normal service conditions is maintained in such a way, that the<br>
phase angle error and ratio error are within acceptable levels. The uniformly distributed<br>
resistance of this special winding helps in effective damping of all kinds of over<br>
voltages, identical to placement of a fixed high voltage neutral resistance [03]. It<br>
provides uniform distributed temperature rise at full rating of the transformer/during<br>
transients and dc discharges. The distributed resistance improves effective heat<br>
dissipation, resulting in enhancement of thermal rating of transformer. The present<br>
innovation also addresses PT damage against sudden drop in burden (in low resistance<br>
networks). The invention is aimed to optimize the PT design, eliminate some of PT<br>
accessories enhancing overall reliability.<br>
The conductivity of the material is selected based on requirements of following<br>
parameters:<br>
1.	Rated voltage of the potential transformer.<br>
2.	DC discharge time and OFF time of potential transformer.<br>
3.	Metering VA rating of PT.<br>
4.	Thermal VA rating of PT.<br>
5.	Over voltage level during service or during transients.<br><br>
6. Input/output impedance of the primary and secondary windings.<br>
Figure 4 shows the schematic of proposed potential transformer. A sample calculation is<br>
made for 145 kV system to understand the effect of resistance of primary winding on<br>
DC discharge capability of potential transformer (refer Figure 5). From the figure, it is<br>
seen that with the increase of resistance of primary winding from 7 kΩ to<br>
15 kΩ, current level decreases and potential transformer discharges the same at faster<br>
rate.<br><br>
