METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING<br>
AN INTAKE AIR FILTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to internal combustion engines, and more<br>
particularly, to a method and apparatus for monitoring an intake air filter for<br>
an engine that is an element of a hybrid powertrain system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines have air intake systems which use air<br>
filtering devices to prevent ingestion of harmful particles into the engine and<br>
combustion chambers. The service life of an element for an air filter varies<br>
depending upon operating environment of the engine. For example, a<br>
vehicle used in a primarily dusty environment requires more frequent service<br>
to and/or replacement of the air filter element than a vehicle used in a clean<br>
environment. Delay in servicing an air filter element can result in increased<br>
engine pumping losses, which can lead to reduced fuel economy. Vehicle<br>
driveability performance can also deteriorate.<br>
[0004] A filter element that is unduly plugged can become an airflow<br>
restriction, meaning that there is a discernible pressure drop across the air<br>
filter. When airflow through the filter element increases, such as at high<br>
engine speed and load conditions, the pressure drop increases, which results<br>
in the aforementioned increase in pumping losses.<br>
[0005] Prior art systems to monitor air filter element plugging have used<br>
pressure drop measurements or other indicators to determine when to service<br>
and replace the filter element. Some prior art systems have incorporated a<br>
barometric pressure sensor upstream of the air filter element which can be<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
used to monitor pressure drop through the air intake system, including a<br>
pressure drop across the filter element. Other systems have incorporated<br>
control algorithms to determine pressure after the filter and upstream of a<br>
throttle valve, in order to determine barometric pressure, which can also be<br>
used to monitor pressure drop across the filter element.<br>
[0006] Barometric pressure varies with weather conditions and altitude.<br>
In a motor vehicle, an accurate determination of barometric pressure is<br>
essential for various engine control functions. For instance, precise metering<br>
of the amount of air and fuel delivered to the engine is necessary to achieve<br>
the desired combustion as well as acceptable vehicle emissions. When the<br>
barometric pressure drops, typically ignition timing must be retarded and the<br>
air/fuel mixture richened. In addition, the barometric pressure may also be<br>
used to control idle bypass airflow, check for limp-in conditions and perform<br>
diagnostic functions.<br>
[0007] Barometric pressure can be measured in a variety of ways.<br>
Currently, in automotive applications, the barometric pressure can be<br>
measured using a barometric pressure sensor mountable on any suitable place<br>
on the vehicle where it sees true atmospheric pressure. Such a sensor<br>
generates an output signal indicative of the atmospheric pressure. The<br>
barometric pressure reading is then used for the various engine control<br>
functions. However, barometric pressure sensors can be costly and it is<br>
always desirable, particularly in automotive applications, to minimize costs.<br>
[0008] Methods have been developed for estimating barometric pressure<br>
without the use of a separate or dedicated barometric pressure sensor. It is<br>
known, for example, that barometric pressure can be estimated when the<br>
vehicle's throttle is wide open (i.e., WOT) and, in some cases, when the<br>
vehicle's throttle is at some part throttle positions using an existing manifold<br>
absolute pressure sensor. However, there is typically a lower throttle<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
position threshold below which barometric pressure cannot be estimated<br>
reliably when the engine is firing or rotating.<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
[0009] On a vehicle equipped with a hybrid powertrain, i.e., an internal<br>
combustion engine coupled to an electro-mechanical or hydro-mechanical<br>
transmission, the engine typically employs an electronic throttle control<br>
system, which decouples operator throttle pedal input from throttle valve<br>
control. Engine operation on a hybrid powertrain may include prolonged<br>
operation at or below the lower throttle position threshold for estimating<br>
barometric pressure, and fewer opportunities for WOT events, thereby<br>
resulting in unreliable barometric pressure estimates. The result of such<br>
operation is barometric pressure values are infrequently updated and thus<br>
become 'stale' and unreliable for monitoring the air filter element.<br>
[0010] Thus, it is desirable to have a reliable method for monitoring an<br>
intake air system including the air filter in a hybrid vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is<br>
provided a method and system for monitoring an intake air filter for an<br>
internal combustion engine of a hybrid powertrain operative to transmit an<br>
output torque to a driveline. The engine has a system-controllable throttle<br>
valve. The method comprises determining a first pressure state comprising<br>
an ambient barometric pressure. A second pressure state is determined<br>
downstream of the air filter during engine operation at a high mass airflow<br>
engine operating point. The hybrid powertrain is controlled to maintain the<br>
transmitted output torque to the driveline. The first and second pressure<br>
states are compared.<br>
[0012] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, the embodiments of which are described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0014] Fig. 1 comprises a schematic diagram, in accordance with the<br>
present invention, and,<br>
[0015] Figs. 2A and 2B comprise algorithmic flowcharts, in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 depicts a schematic drawing of a hybrid electric vehicle 10.<br>
The hybrid electric vehicle 10 includes an internal combustion engine 12, an<br>
electrical power source 14, an electrical machine 16, and at least one control<br>
module 18. The hybrid electric vehicle 10 may have any suitable drive train<br>
configuration, such as a series hybrid drive, a parallel hybrid drive, or a split<br>
hybrid drive as is known by those skilled in the art. The internal combustion<br>
engine 12 comprises a multi-cylinder engine having a rotating crankshaft, the<br>
rotations of which are sensed by a speed sensor 20. Speed sensor 20 may be<br>
any appropriate sensor of the type adapted to generate a signal indicative of<br>
the rotational speed of the crankshaft. An example of such a sensor is a<br>
magnetic pickup adjacent to a toothed flywheel (not shown) of the engine 12<br>
coupled to a counter that counts pulses for unit time and supplies such counts<br>
on a regular basis.<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0017] The engine 12 as depicted comprises a naturally-aspirated air<br>
intake system wherein the intake air flows from the atmosphere at barometric<br>
pressure to an air inlet and through an air filter device 22 comprising a case<br>
and an air filter element 23. An outlet of the air filter device leads to<br>
ductwork that includes a mass air flow (MAP) sensor 25 and leads to a<br>
system-controllable intake-air flow management device, in this embodiment<br>
comprising an electronic throttle control (ETC) device 24 including a throttle<br>
plate which is controlled by the control module 18. The ETC device 24 is<br>
controlled by the control module 18 to regulate flow of air into an intake<br>
manifold 26 for distribution to the cylinders of the engine. Associated with<br>
the intake manifold 26 is a pressure sensor 28 for measuring manifold<br>
absolute pressure (MAP). MAP sensor 28 generates a signal indicative of<br>
the absolute pressure within the intake manifold 26 downstream of the<br>
throttle plate. Engine operation is generally characterized in terms of the<br>
engine speed and load or mass airflow, referred to as an engine operating<br>
point, which can range from a low speed, low load condition to a high-<br>
speed, high load condition.<br>
[0018] The electrical power source 14 may be of any suitable type. For<br>
example, an electrical power source 14 such as a battery, a battery pack<br>
having a plurality of electrically interconnected cells, a capacitor, or a fuel<br>
cell may be employed. Alternatively, a non-electrical power source, such as<br>
a hydraulic power source can be employed. For simplicity, the description<br>
below will primarily refer to an embodiment of the present invention that<br>
incorporates an electrical power source.<br>
[0019] The electrical machine 16 may be of any suitable type, such as an<br>
electric motor or motor-generator, an electro-mechanical transmission device<br>
having a motor or a motor-generator, or, a starter-alternator. As depicted in<br>
Fig. 1, the electrical machine 16 is connected to the engine 12 and the power<br>
source 14. More specifically, the electrical machine 16 may be powered by<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
the power source 14 and may be adapted to drive the engine 12 or one or<br>
more vehicle traction wheels 30. In addition, power may flow through the<br>
electrical machine 16 in the opposite direction to charge the power source or<br>
drive the engine 12. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the electrical<br>
machine 16 is connected to a driveline comprising a differential 32 connected<br>
to a pair of axles or transaxles 34 each connected to a vehicle traction wheel<br>
30.<br>
[00201 The control module 18 monitors operator inputs, including an<br>
operator torque request (To_REQ) typically input through an accelerator pedal,<br>
and controls various aspects of the hybrid electric vehicle 10 to meet the<br>
operator torque request and achieve other functions. For example, the<br>
control module 18 may be connected to the engine 12, the power source 14,<br>
and electrical machine 16 to monitor and control their operation and<br>
performance. In addition, the control module 18 also processes inputs from<br>
the various sensors for controlling the engine 12 and electrical machine 16.<br>
[0021] The control module 18 is preferably a general-purpose digital<br>
computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit,<br>
storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM), random access<br>
memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM),<br>
i.e., non-volatile memory, high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and<br>
digital to analog (D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O)<br>
and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. The control module<br>
has a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and<br>
calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions<br>
thereof. Information transfer between the control module and any other on-<br>
vehicle computers can be accomplished using some form of controller area<br>
network (CAN).<br>
[0022] Algorithms are typically executed during preset loop cycles such<br>
that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by the central<br>
processing unit and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices<br>
and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 100, and 1000 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0023] Referring now to Pigs. 2A and 2B, flowcharts are provided to<br>
further describe aspects of the invention. The flowcharts depict details of<br>
algorithms and calibrations which have been reduced to machine code for<br>
execution in the control module 18. At start of vehicle operation, the system<br>
is initialized (Step 50), which includes verifying a need to execute the code.<br>
After the initialization, it is determined whether entrance criteria have been<br>
met (Step 52), including identifying presence of faults in any sensors or<br>
actuators, and determining presence of acceptable operating conditions.<br>
States of parameters comprising MAP, MAP, ambient barometric pressure<br>
P1, and stagnation pressure P2 are determined (Step 54). It is preferred to<br>
measure pressure drop across the air filter element (i.e., P1-P2) under<br>
conditions which arc most favorable to measure and discern air flow<br>
restrictions resulting from plugging, i.e., at higher engine airflows which<br>
occur at higher engine speed and load conditions. A difference between the<br>
ambient pressure P1 and stagnation pressure P2 is determined, and compared<br>
to a leak threshold difference in pressure which has been precalibrated based<br>
upon mass airflow (i.e., Thr_JLeak(MAF)) to determine presence of leaks in<br>
the intake system (Step 56). The leak test algorithm is aborted if a leak is so<br>
detected, a leak fault indicator (NL) is incremented, and a test pass counter<br>
(N) is reset to zero (Step 70). When the leak fault indicator (N1.) exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold, Thr_NL (Step 72), a 'NO FILTER/LEAK' result is<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
reported as an identified fault to the control module (Step 64), and the<br>
operator is notified to service the air filter (Step 66).<br>
[0024] When no leak is detected in Step 56, the difference between the<br>
ambient pressure P1 and stagnation pressure P2 is then compared to a<br>
plugged filter threshold pressure difference which has been precalibratcd<br>
based upon mass airflow (i.e., Thr_Plug(MAF)) to determine if the pressure<br>
drop across the air filter indicates a plugged filter (Step 58). When the<br>
difference between the ambient pressure P1 and stagnation pressure P2 is<br>
less than the plugged filter threshold, i.e.,<br>
P1-P2 
[0025] it is determined that the filter is functioning properly. The leak<br>
fault indicator (NL) and fault indicator (FI) are reset to zero, and the test pass<br>
counter (N) is incremented (Step 80). When the test pass counter exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold, ThrN (Step 82), any previously set notification to<br>
the vehicle operator to service the air filter (e.g., a "Service Air Filter"<br>
light) is discontinued (Step 84). Otherwise the air filter monitoring routine<br>
ends for the trip.<br>
[0026] When the difference between the ambient pressure P1 and<br>
stagnation pressure P2 is greater than the plugged filter threshold, i.e., Pl-<br>
P2 &gt; Thr_Plug(MAF)), the fault indicator (FI) is incremented and the test<br>
pass counter (N) and the leak fault indicator (NL) are reset to zero (Step 60),<br>
indicating that there is a fault, i.e., some form of airflow restriction in the<br>
intake system during the trip. When the fault indicator (FI) exceeds a fault<br>
indicator threshold (Step 62), a fault is identified (Step 64) and the vehicle<br>
operator is notified (Step 66), preferably with some form of "Service Air<br>
Filter" light on the vehicle dashboard. Preferably, the algorithm described is<br>
executed once per vehicle trip, or once per engine on-off operating cycle.<br>
[0027] The plugged filter threshold (Thr_Plug(MAF)) comprises an array<br>
of calibrated thresholds which are predetermined for a range of engine<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
airflow (MAP) levels, and preferably developed using a representative<br>
engine with a production-intent air intake system utilizing plugged air filter<br>
elements or other simulated airflow restriction devices.<br>
[0028] Steps 60-66 comprise a method of verifying presence of a fault<br>
through iterative testing and notifying the vehicle operator. The fault<br>
threshold FI_Thr can comprise occurrence of a quantity of consecutive<br>
faults, or, alternatively, X quantity of faults occurring over Y consecutive<br>
test iterations, or other suitable fault detection scheme.<br>
[0029] The entrance criteria of Step 52 include identifying presence of<br>
faults in any sensors or actuators, and determining presence of acceptable<br>
operating conditions. The faults of interest include faults associated with the<br>
ETC device 24, the MAP sensor 25, the MAP sensor 28, and the engine<br>
speed sensor 20, and any ambient air pressure sensors mechanized in the<br>
system, such as to monitor P1 and P2. Faults of interest include those<br>
associated with an electric power supply and wiring harnesses between the<br>
devices and the control module. FTC device faults comprise faults in<br>
sensors which measure throttle valve position, a fault with the throttle motor<br>
control such that the ETC device 24 cannot be controlled, or a detection of<br>
too high an airflow compared to what the airflow estimated from the throttle<br>
position is expected to be, or too low an airflow compared with what the<br>
airflow from the throttle position is expected to be. The MAF sensor output<br>
is compared to determine that it is operating in a standard range, and is<br>
consistent with estimated airflow readings. The MAP sensor 28 is checked<br>
to determine that it is operating in a standard range, i.e. below an upper limit<br>
and above a lower limit. Also engine speed faults may be present if the<br>
engine speed sensor 20 is missing or erratic.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Fig. 2B, determining the barometric pressure P1<br>
and the stagnation pressure P2 (Step 54) is now described in detail. The<br>
barometric pressure P1 is a measure of ambient pressure, which is subject to<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
variation based upon vehicle elevation, and atmospheric conditions. The<br>
barometric pressure P1 is determined (Step 150) which include directly<br>
measuring the barometric pressure using an appropriately located sensing<br>
device or measuring/estimating the barometric pressure using information<br>
from a sensor which serves other functions. The barometric pressure P1 is<br>
regularly and periodically updated or refreshed, either after a predetermined<br>
time lapse or, preferably, after the vehicle has traveled a predetermined<br>
distance in order to ensure the barometric pressure accurately reflects the<br>
ambient conditions.<br>
[0031] The barometric pressure P1 for a hybrid vehicle can be<br>
determined during periods of vehicle operation in which the engine 12 is not<br>
firing and not rotating. This can occur during a vehicle stop condition when<br>
the engine has been shut off, or during operating conditions when vehicle<br>
tractive torque is provided exclusively by the electrical machine 16 to drive<br>
the vehicle 10 and the engine has been shut off. When the engine 12 is not<br>
rotating, system air pressure equilibrates as the intake manifold 26 fills with<br>
atmospheric air and, thus, the barometric pressure can be estimated to equal<br>
the pressure measured by the MAP sensor 28 since there is little or no air<br>
flow. Preferably, this estimate is taken after a precalibrated amount of time<br>
has elapsed since the engine stopped rotating in order to allow the intake<br>
manifold 26 sufficient time to equilibrate pressure with the atmospheric air,<br>
for example, five (5) seconds.<br>
[0032] The barometric pressure P1 can be estimated during a low flow<br>
operating condition, e.g., a part-throttle operation at low engine speed.<br>
Estimating the barometric pressure P1 at part-throttle operation at low engine<br>
speed involves a predetermined calibration table or equation based upon<br>
manifold pressure (MAP), engine speed (RPM), throttle position (TPS),<br>
and/or airflow (MAP). The predetermined calibration preferably comprises<br>
a plurality of pressure offsets (Offset(MAF, TPS) determined over ranges of<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
airflows and throttle positions. The pressure offset is added to the MAP<br>
state to estimate barometric pressure P1. The pressure offset calibration is<br>
developed using a representative engine with a production-intent air intake<br>
system utilizing a clean air filter element. One method to estimate<br>
barometric pressure using a pressure offset calibration is described in<br>
commonly assigned co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 11/464314,<br>
(Attorney Docket No. GP307834), entitled "Method and System for<br>
Estimating Barometric Pressure in a Hybrid Vehicle", which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0033] The stagnation pressure P2 is determined (Steps 152 and 154).<br>
The stagnation pressure P2 comprises a pressure state in the intake air<br>
ductwork upstream of the throttle blade of the ETC device 24. Stagnation<br>
pressure is preferably determined at high engine operating points which<br>
occur at high engine speed and load conditions, e.g., at or near WOT<br>
conditions. Estimating the stagnation pressure P2 at wide-open-throttle also<br>
requires the aforementioned predetermined calibration table or equation<br>
based upon manifold pressure (MAP), engine speed (RPM), throttle position,<br>
and/or airflow (MAP). The predetermined calibration preferably comprises<br>
the offset pressure value (Offset(MAP, TPS) which is added to the MAP<br>
pressure to estimate the stagnation pressure P2. On a system employing an<br>
intake air pump device such as a turbocharger in the air intake system (not<br>
shown), the stagnation pressure P2 is defined to be pressure in the air duct<br>
after the air cleaner element and upstream of an air inlet to the turbocharger,<br>
and can be measured directly using a pressure sensing device.<br>
[0034] The stagnation pressure P2 is preferably determined under<br>
conditions of high airflow as previously described, measured within a<br>
predetermined elapsed distance from when the barometric pressure P1 is<br>
measured. To determine the stagnation pressure P2 within the<br>
predetermined elapsed distance from when the barometric pressure P1 is<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
measured, the control module executes a control scheme to intrusively<br>
command the engine to a wide open throttle condition. Concurrently and in<br>
corresponding magnitude, the control module executes algorithms to manage<br>
overall powertrain torque output to meet the operator torque request (To_REQ),<br>
to accommodate the increased engine torque output resulting from engine<br>
operation at or near WOT (Step 152). This comprises the control module<br>
executing torque control schemes to manage the increased engine torque by<br>
correspondingly increasing torque absorbed through the electrical machine<br>
16 in form of electrical energy generation and charging of electrical power<br>
source 14, by decreasing torque output by the electrical machine 16 to the<br>
driveline, or some combination thereof. In so doing, torque output to the<br>
driveline is substantially unchanged, and therefore no torque surge is<br>
perceived by the operator. When the engine operating state at or near WOT<br>
is achieved, P2 at the high mass air flowrate can be estimated as above (Step<br>
154). When stagnation pressure P2 has been estimated or measured, normal<br>
powertrain operation is commanded (Step 156), and the torque control and<br>
management schemes are phased out and discontinued as the throttle is<br>
controlled to normal operation.<br>
[0035] The leak test (Step 56) is based upon there being some airflow-<br>
based pressure drop in a properly assembled air intake system having a<br>
substantially clean filter element. On a system configuration that contains no<br>
leaks, there is a pressure drop between the ambient pressure P1 and the<br>
stagnation pressure P2 measured at WOT operation. If a leak is introduced<br>
due to a misassembly of a system or a hole in the ductwork, or if the filter<br>
element is missing, the pressure drop between the ambient pressure P1 and<br>
the stagnation pressure P2 (preferably determined at WOT operation) is<br>
perceptibly less. The leak threshold (Thr_Leak(MAF)) can be determined<br>
and calibrated during pre-production testing of a representative system based<br>
upon MAP. Alternatively, the leak test can comprise a separate and distinct<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
test wherein a pressure drop is determined between the ambient pressure P1<br>
and the stagnation pressure P2 determined at a low engine flow operation.<br>
The pressure drop between the ambient pressure P1 and the stagnation<br>
pressure P2 measured at low or closed throttle operation is perceptibly less<br>
in presence of a leak or a missing filter element, and the leak threshold<br>
(Thr_Leak(MAF)) can be determined and calibrated during pre-production<br>
testing of a representative system. The leak test described herein is<br>
primarily intended to identify leaks and misasscmblies occurring in the air<br>
cleaner and ductwork leading to the MAF sensor 25. A second algorithm,<br>
e.g., an intake air flow rationality algorithm, uses engine speed/load<br>
measurements and signals from the MAF sensor 25 to identify presence of<br>
leaks between the MAF sensor and the engine.<br>
[0036] On a typical FTC system, a calibration for TPS v. MAF is a fixed<br>
relationship. When the FTC is controlled to WOT, i.e., 100% TPS, a result<br>
can include a dead throttle blade travel position at WOT or a non-linear<br>
torque response if the true maximum throttle opening occurs before 100%<br>
indicated throttle position. There is potentially a loss of engine torque<br>
capacity if the true WOT throttle position varies from the throttle position<br>
indicated by 100% TPS.<br>
[0037] Indicated throttle position (TPS) is determined as follows in Fq.<br>
1:<br>
TPS = (TPS meas - TPS min) *100%	[1]<br>
(TPS_max - TPS_min)<br>
wherein:<br>
TPS_mcas comprises the currently measured TPS reading;<br>
TPS_min comprises the TPS reading at minimum airflow; and,<br>
TPS_max comprises the TPS reading at maximum airflow.<br>
[0038] Under conditions described hereinabove wherein the control<br>
module commands the FTC to a wide-open throttle position, the control<br><br>
GP-308565-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
module selectively executes algorithms to control the ETC to increase the<br>
throttle opening in a step-wise manner. Increasing the throttle opening in a<br>
step-wise manner comprises controlling the throttle to monotonically increase<br>
opening in discrete steps, typically measured by discrete TPS readings, e.g.,<br>
75%, 80%, 85%, etc., up to the ETC throttle blade reaching a maximum<br>
position or stop, as indicated by electrical current required to control the<br>
ETC. Readings are taken from the MAF sensor, and the TPS is determined<br>
at each of the steps, to determine mass air flow and corresponding throttle<br>
position. The mass air flow and throttle position results are evaluated to<br>
identify a maximum mass air flow and corresponding TPS reading. The<br>
TPS reading at which the maximum mass air flow occurs becomes the<br>
maximum TPS reading, i.e., TPS_max, for future control purposes, and is<br>
stored in one of the non-volatile memory devices. In one implementation,<br>
the control module monitors airflow as the throttle position is increased.<br>
When the mechanical stop is encountered or the airflow starts to decrease<br>
(meaning the throttle blade is already past a maximum airflow), then the<br>
control algorithm begins to decrease the throttle slowly (limited to a<br>
calibration) until the airflow reaches maximum. The algorithm can be<br>
enabled periodically, e.g., once every 10 key cycles or so, or after loss of<br>
the TPS_max position due to memory corruption. There are enable criteria<br>
to ensure the learning only occurs when there are no errors in the sensors<br>
being learned or used, including e.g., MAP sensor errors. There can also be<br>
a rate limitation to ensure the TPS_max position changes by less than a<br>
calibratable amount to provide stability.<br>
