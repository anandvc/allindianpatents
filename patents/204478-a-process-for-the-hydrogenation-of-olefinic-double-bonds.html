PROCESS FOR THE HYDROGENATION OF DIENE (CO)POLYMERS<br>
The present invention relates to a catalytic composition which can be used for the hydrogenation of olefinically unsaturated compounds, particularly for the selective hydrogenation of polymers and copolymers of conjugated dienes.<br>
Polymers obtained by the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes are widely used on a commercial scale.<br>
In the polymeric chain these (co)polymers have olefinic double bonds which,  useful when used in vulcanization, are responsible for a poor stability, particularly resistance to oxidation.<br>
In particular, the block copolymers obtained starting from conjugated dienes and vinyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons are adopted non-vulcanized as thermoplastic elastomers or as shock-resistant transparent resins or as modifiers of styrene resins or olefinic resins. Owing to the presence of unsaturated<br><br>
double bonds in the polymeric chain, the above block copolymers have a poor resistance to oxidation, ozone and atmospheric aging. This is a great disadvantage for their application.<br>
This lack of stability can be greatly reduced by selectively hydrogenating the olefinic double bonds of the above copolymers.<br>
The known methods for hydrogenating polymers having olefinic double bonds are based on (1) supported heterogeneous catalysts consisting of inert carriers (for example silica, alumina, carbon) on which a metal such as nickel, platinum, palladium, etc. is deposited and (2) non-supported homogeneous catalysts obtained by reacting an organometallic compound of nickel, cobalt, titanium or the like, with a reducing compound such as an organo-aluminum, an organomagnesium or an organoli-thium.<br>
With respect to supported heterogeneous catalysts (1) , non-supported catalysts (2) have the quality of a greater activity. This is a considerable advantage as it allows blander hydrogenation conditions to be adopted, with smaller quantities of catalyst.<br>
US-A-4.501.857 describes a hydrogenation process of non-living polymers carried out in the presence of (A) a bis-(cyclopentadienyl) titanium derivative and<br><br>
(B) at least one organolithium derivative, the molar ratio between lithium atoms and titanium atoms being from 0.1 to 100.<br>
EP-A-434.469 describes a catalytic composition which comprises (a) at least one titanium bis-cyclopen-tadienyl derivative and (b) at least one compound selected from those having general formula (i) M2 (AlR^^R^ and (ii) M2 (MgReRfR9) , wherein M2, is selected from lithium, sodium and potassium. Compound<br>
(i) can be obtained by the reaction of an organ-alkaline compound with an organo-aluminum compound, whereas compound (ii) can be obtained by the reaction of an organo-alkaline compound with an organo-magnesium derivative.<br>
EP-A-601.953 describes a hydrogenation process carried out in the presence of a catalyst having the general formula Cp2Ti(PhOR)2 or Cp2Ti (CH2PPh2) 2.<br>
All the above processes differ in reality not so much in the hydrogenation reaction as in the preparation process of the catalytic species.<br>
The process described in US-A-4.501.857 is the simplest among those mentioned as it starts from a compound which is easily available on the market<br>
(titaniumdicyclopentadienylchloride) and involves only the addition of an organic lithium derivative. Unfortu-<br><br>
nately the data provided by this patent show how the process, which is very effective when applied to living polymers, gives a poor hydrogenation yield when applied to non-living polymers (see Table III compared with Table II) .<br>
On the other hand, EP-A-434.469 comprises the presence of compounds (i) or (ii), which require the reaction, not included in US-A-4.501.857, between an organo-alkaline derivative (usually an organolithium derivative) and an organo-aluminum or organo-magnesium derivative, with the Titanium compound.<br>
The process of EP-A-601.953 is also complex as it involves the preparation and isolation of particular titanium dicyclopentadienyl derivatives obtained starting from Cp2TiCl2.<br>
In any case all the catalysts of the prior art have the disadvantage of requiring high quantities of Titanium; in addition the hydrogenation rates are unsatisfactory.<br>
A catalytic composition has now been found which can be used in the selective hydrogenation of olefinic double bonds which overcomes the above drawbacks as it is simple to prepare and is also much more active than the catalysts described in the above patents.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention<br><br>
relates to a catalytic composition effective in the hydrogenation of olefinic double bonds, particularly in the selective hydrogenation of olefinic double bonds present in copolymers between dienes and vinylbenzenes, even more particularly styrene-butadiene and styrene-isoprene block copolymers, prepared by reaction between :<br>
(A)	at least one cyclopentadienyl complex of a transi<br>
tion metal having general formula (I) (R) (R^M^R2) (R3)<br>
wherein<br>
R is an anion containing an ?75-cyclopentadienyl ring coordinated to M1 and is preferably cyclopentadienyl; M1 is selected from titanium, zirconium and hafnium, preferably titanium;<br>
R2 and R3, the same or different, are organic or inorganic anion groups bound to M^ preferably selected from hydride, halide, C^-Cg alkyl group, C5-C8 cycloalkyl group, C6-C10 aryl group, C^-Cg alkoxyl group, C^-Cg carboxyl group; even more preferably they are both equal to chloride;<br>
R1 is selected from cyclopentadienyl and R2; with<br>
(B)	an alkylating composition essentially consisting<br>
of:<br>
(bl) an organometallic compound having general formula<br><br>
(II) M2 (R") (R') , wherein Mj is selected from Zn and Mg and is preferably Mg, R4 is selected from aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably C^-C^ aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals, even more preferably 0,-Cg; R5 is a halogen or is equal to R4;<br>
(b2) an organoderivative of Aluminum having general formula (III) Al (R6)3, wherein R6 is a C,-C16 aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, preferably C^-Cg.<br>
The preparation of the catalytic composition of the present invention takes place by mixing the cyclo-pentadienyl derivative having general formula (I) with alkyating agents (bl) and (b2). In the preferred embodiment, all the components are dissolved in inert solvents. More specifically the alkylating composition can be dissolved in a single solvent.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the molar ratio between the compound having general formula (I) and the alkylating compound (bl) is from 1/1 to 1/10, preferably from 1/3 to 1/7; the molar ratio between (b2) and (I) is less than 1, preferably from 0,3/1 to 0.9/1.<br>
As specified above, in the preferred embodiment, in the compound having general formula (I) , M1 is Ti, R1 is cyclopentadienyl, whereas R2 and R3 are halides, preferably chlorides. Other non-limiting examples of<br><br>
compounds having general  formula   (I)   are listed below:<br>
(T75-C5H5)TiCl3	,        (rj5-THInd)TiCl3<br>
(r?5-Ind)Ti(NMe2)3        ,        (r&gt;5-Flu)TiCl3<br>
(r?5-C5Me5)TiCl3	,        (r?5-C5H5) TiCl^e<br>
(r75-Ind)Ti(OMe)3	,        (r]5-Ind) TiCl3<br>
(T75-C5H5) TiCl2Ph	,	(r?5-Flu) Ti (OBu)3<br>

(r?5-Ind)2Ti(OMe)2        ,        (rj5-Ind) 2TiCl2<br>
(T75-C5H5) 2TiClPh	,	(r?5-Flu) 2Ti (OBu) 2<br>
The following abbreviations were used in the above formulae: Me = methyl, Bu = butyl, Ind = indenyl, THInd = 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-indenyl, Flu = fluorenyl, Ph = phenyl,   Et =  ethyl.<br>
The alkylating component (bl) is preferably selected from alkylmagnesium halides, normally known as Grignard compounds, and Magnesium dialkyls. Both groups of products are well known and there are numerous methods for their preparation. Many organometallic compounds having general formula (II) M2(R4) (R5) , wherein M2 is selected from Zn and Mg, are commercial products, normally in the form of solutions in an inert hydrocarbon solvent. Preferred organometallic compounds are  magnesium  dialkyls,   i.e.   compounds  having  general<br><br>
formula (II) wherein both R4 and R5 are selected from Cj-C^, preferably C^C^ linear or branched alkyls. Typical examples of magnesium dialkyls are magnesium di-n-butyl, magnesium di-isobutyl, magnesium di-isopro-pyl, magnesium butyl-isobutyl, magnesium di-cyclohexyl, magnesium butyl-octyl and relative mixtures.<br>
As far as compound (b2) is concerned, A1(R6)3 is a trialkyl aluminum, wherein R6 is a C,-C16, preferably C^-Cg, aliphatic hydrocarbon radical. Aluminum trialkyls are also commercially available; typical examples are aluminum tri-ethyl, aluminum tri-isobutyl, aluminum tri-isopropyl, and relative mixtures.<br>
The preparation of the catalytic composition of the present invention is preferably carried out in an inert atmosphere. The term "inert atmosphere" means an atmosphere of one or more gases which do not react with any of the species present in the reaction environment. Typical examples of these gases are helium, neon, argon and the relative mixtures. Alternatively hydrogen can also be used. Air and oxygen are not appropriate Decause they oxidate or decompose the hydrogenation catalyst making it inactive.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the catalytic composition of the present Invention can be prepared in the presence of the<br><br>
catalytic compound which is to be hydrogenated. The latter can form the diluent itself in which the preparation of the catalyst is effected, or it can be mixed with an inert diluent of the type described above. In particular, especially in the case of non-polymeric unsaturated compounds, the component to be hydrogenated can be added entirely or partially to component (A) before the reaction with component (B) . Alternatively, the unsaturated compound is added after contact between (A) and (B), but before introducing the hydrogen.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the hydrogenation of olefinic double bonds present both in compounds having a low molecular weight, and in unsaturated oligomers or polymers and copolymers, preferably obtained by the (co)polymerization of conjugated dienes, which comprises putting the substrate to be hydrogenated in contact with hydrogen in an inert solvent, in the presence of the catalytic composition according to claim 1, for a period sufficient to obtain a selective hydrogenation of at least 50%, preferably at least 90% of the olefinc double bonds.<br>
Non-polymeric substrates which can be hydrogenated<br>
according to the process of the present invention<br>
\     consist of the usual aliphatic and aromatic olefins<br><br>
having from 2 to 30, preferably from 4 to 25, carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, butenes, octenes, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, undecene, cyclododecatet-raene, norbornene, styrene (selective hydrogenation to ethylbenzene), divinylbenzenes, conjugated dienes such as butadiene,  isoprene,  chloroprene,  non-conj ugated dienes such as ethylidenenorbornadiene, 1,4-hexadiene and the like, acetylene derivatives such as acetylene, 2-butine, 1-hexine. Equally suitable as substrates are also olefins and styrene derivatives comprising hetero-atoms such as,  for example,  halogens,  especially chlorine and fluorine, silicon, boron, sulfur, oxygen. Other non-polymeric unsaturatetd substrates consist, for example, of esters of unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic or ricinoleic acids, esters of unsaturated acids with a short chain such as, for example, acrylic, methacrylic, maleic or fumaric acid; vinyl esters of aliphatic or aromatic acids.<br>
The hydrogenation of these non-polymeric substrates can be carried out in an inert diluent medium, or also on the compound to be hydrogenated as such. The process is carried out in suitable reactors, under hydrogen pressure usually ranging from 0.5 to 10 MPa, preferably at temperatures ranging from 2 0 to 100°C and for times varying from 10 minutes to several hours,<br><br>
depending on the substrate to be hydrogenated and the hydrogenation degree desired. Blander conditions can be used, for example, if a primary double bond is to be hydrogenated, leaving a secondary one intact in a non-conjugated diene.<br>
With respect to the hydrogenation reaction of (co)polymers, this is carried out under normal conditions (temperature, hydrogen pressure, solvent) well-known in the art. It is possible to use, for example, temperatures ranging from 20 to 150°C, preferably from 70 to 130°C, pressures ranging from 0.1 to 10 MPa, preferably from 0.2 to 5, MPa, the solvents of the (co)polymers preferably consisting of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic, saturated hydrocarbons, having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms and relative mixtures. It is evident that higher temperatures and pressures accelerate the hydrogenation rate.<br>
According to an embodiment, the solution of the (co)polymer to be hydrogenated is charged, under a hydrogen atmosphere, into the hydrogenation reactor followed by the catalyst composition, as such or, preferably, diluted in one or more solvents. The whole mixture is then pressurized with hydrogen and brought to the desired temperature. When the hydrogenation is complete, the hydrogenated (co)polymer is recovered<br><br>
according to the known techniques which comprise, for example, direct distillation of the solvent, or coagulation of the polymer with a non-solvent, its recovery and subsequent drying.<br>
The catalytic compositions which can be obtained with the process of the present invention are also active in the hydrogenation process in very low quantities, indicatively up to 10 ppm of M with respect to the substrate to be subjected to hydrogenation, with a ratio between moles of metal M and olefinic double bonds of up to 1:60000. This is a definite advantage with respect to the catalysts of the known art.<br>
The (co)polymers of conjugated dienes mentioned above include homopolymers of conjugated dienes and copolymers obtained by copolymerizing at least one conjugated diene with at least one olefin copolymeriz-able with the above conjugated diene.<br>
Typical examples of conjugated dienes are 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2-methyl-l,3-pentadiene, 1,3-hexadiene, 4,5-diethyl-l, 3-octadiene and 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene. Isoprene and 1,3-butadiene, more preferably 1,3-butadiene are particularly useful as intermediates for the production of elastomers having excellent physico-chemical properties. Typical examples are therefore<br><br>
polybutadiene,  polyisoprene  ana  Ducaaiene/ JL copolymers.<br>
Olefinic monomers which can be used in the copoly-merization together with the dienes listed above, are all unsaturated monomers copolymerizable with the above conjugated dienes, particularly vinyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons. Among these styrene, t-butyl styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, o-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, vinyl naphthalene are particularly suitable. In particular the most useful vinyl aromatic compound is styrene.<br>
Typical examples of block copolymers which can be used as substrates in the hydrogenation process described above are those having general formula (B-T-A-B)mX and (A-T-B)mX, wherein B are polydiene blocks, the same or different from each other, A is a polyvinylaromatic block, T is a statistic copolymeric segment consisting of diene and vinylaromatic monomeric units, X is a coupling radical with a valence "m", "m" is an integer from 1 to 20, the content of segment T preferably being from 0 to 40% by weight. When "m" is equal to 1, X is the residue of a quenching agent, for example -Si- (CH3)3 when monochlorotrimethylsilane is used; when "m" is equal to or higher than 2, X is the residue of a coupling agent,  such as for example<br><br>
=Si (CH3) 2 in the case of dimethyldichlorosilane, =Si (CH3) - in the case of methyltrichlorosilane and =Si= in the case of silicon tetrachloride.<br>
In the above block copolymers, the content of vinylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbons is from 5 to 95%, preferably between 10 and 69%. In the above copolymers, the content of 1,2 or 3,4 units of poly-diene phase can vary from 10 to 80%, preferably from 30 to 60%.<br>
As well as the styrene-diene block copolymers mentioned above, it is possible to hydrogenate with the process of the present invention random copolymers with a linear or branched structure having monomers statistically distributed in the polymeric chain and quantities of 1,2 or 3,4 units varying from 10 to 80% by weight.<br>
The (co)polymers which can be used in the process of the present invention do not have a particular molecular weight. However they generally have a number average molecular weight ranging from 1000 to about a million.<br>
The hydrogenation process of the present invention is also possible in the presence of low quantities of metal, especially Titanium. In addition the hydrogenation times are particularly short.<br><br>

COMMENTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS<br>
Examples 1-3 and comparative examples 5-7 refer to the hydrogenation of polymeric solutions of SBS. A comparison of the two series of tests, carried out in the presence of the same quantities of Ti and at the same temperature, shows hew the catalytic composition of the present invention is decidedly much more effective than the catalytic composition without aluminum alkyl.<br><br>
Infact example 1 (carried out in the presence of Cp2TiCl2/MgBu2/AlEt3 refers to a hydrogenation carried out with 80 ppm of Ti; the conversions are almost total after 5 minutes both at 100°C and 130°C. On the contrary, comparative example 6, carried out again with 80 ppm of Ti but in the presence of the system Cp2TiCl2/ MgBu2, gives conversion times of 120 minutes at 100°C and 90 minutes at 130°C.<br>
In the same way example 2 should be compared with comparative example 7 (both tests carried out with 6 0 ppm of Ti).<br>
Example 3 describes the hydrogenation test in the presence of only 40 ppm of Ti. Among the comparative examples there is no similar test as after 120 minutes the hydrogenation degree is practically zero.<br>
It should also be pointed out that, in the case of the catalytic system of the present invention, the minimum quantity of Titanium to have the maximum hydrogenation activity is 80 ppm (example 1), whereas in the case of the system Cp2TiCl2/MgBu2/ the minimum quantity is 120 ppm.<br>
Test 4 and comparative example 8 both refer to hydrogenation tests of SIS copolymers, substrates which are more difficult to hydrogenate than SBS. It can be observed how in example 4 there is a conversion of<br><br>
90.8% in 120 minutes whereas (with the same temperature and quantity of Ti) in comparative example 8 there is a conversion of only 58.8% after 150 minutes. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 9 9A)  Preparation of the catalytic composition<br>
2 0 ml of cyclohexane, 2.7 ml of a solution in THF of Cp2TiCl2 at a concentration of 10.36 g/1, therefore 0.028 g (0.112 mmoles) , 0.58 ml of an 0.77 M solution in n-hexane of aluminum triethyl (51.16 mg corresponding to 0.45 mmoles), with a ratio Al/Ti = 4, are charged in order into a 100 ml Schlenk tube, in an argon atmosphere. This mixture is left under stirring in an argon atmosphere for 3 0 minutes at room temperature . 9B.1)     Hvdrogenation reaction<br>
600 grams of a polymeric solution in cyclohexane of SBS copolymer at 7.5% by weight (with characteristics of 45% of vinyl, a percentage composition of sty-rene/butadiene 33/67, and Mw of 170000) are transferred to a 1 litre Buchi-type steel reactor; the stirring is started at 1000 rpm, hydrogen is charged up to 6 bars and the temperature thermostat-regulated at 100°C. The catalytic composition as per point 9A is added to the reactor thus prepared together with a quantity of Ti with respect to the dry polymer equal to 120 ppm and<br><br>
with a ratio olefinic double bonds/moles of Ti equal to 5200. The hydrogen pressure in the reaetpr is brought to 24 bars. The results are indicated in Table 3. 9B.2)     Hydrogenation reaction<br>
The reaction is carried out as in 9B.1), but at 130°C. The results are indicated in table 3,<br>
The same table 3 also indicates the data of example 1, in which only 80 ppm of Ti are used, against 120 ppm of comparative example 9.<br><br><br>
The data of table 3 clearly show how a catalyst without the magnesium compound is much less effective than that of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
