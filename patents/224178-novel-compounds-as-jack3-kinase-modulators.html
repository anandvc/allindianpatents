Novel quinoline-carbaxamides as JAK3 kinase modulators<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which are JAK3 Kinase inhibitors, <br>
5     processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3) 15 a member of the Janus family of protein kinases. Although the other members of th15 family are expressed by essentially all t15sues, JAK3 expression 15<br>
10     limited to hematopoetic cells. Th15 15 cons15tent with its essential role in signaling through the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, JJL-9, IL-13 and IL-15 by non-covalent assoC1ation of JAK3 with the gamma chain common to these multichain receptors. These cytokines all have a shared function in mat they are involved in lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation. XSCGD patient populations have been identified with severely reduced levels<br>
15     of JAK3 protein or with genetic defects to the common gamma chain, suggesting that immunosupression should result from blocking signaling through the JAK3 pathway. Animal studies have suggested that JAK3 not only play a critical role in B- and T-lymphocyte maturation, but that JAK3 15 constitutively required to maintain T-cell function. Modulation of immune activity through th15 novel mechan15m can prove useful in the<br>
20     treatment of T-cell proliferative d15orders such as transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases.<br>
          The role of JAK3 in mast cells has been described in knockout mice. Thus, IgE/antigen      <br>
          induced degranulation and mediator release were substantially reduced in mast cells<br>
 25     generated from JAK3 defiC1ent mice. JAK3 defiC1ency does not affect mast cell<br>
proliferation in vitro, it has also been shown that IgE receptor levels and mediator contents are identical in JAK3-/- and JAK3 +/+ mast cells. Therefore, JAK3 appears essential for the complete response of IgE challenged mast cells. The role of JAK3 in mast cell activation has been well establ15hed in murine system, however, there 15 no publ15hed data on mast cell<br><br>

A 'heteroatom' is a nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atom. Where rings include nitrogen atoms, these may be substituted as necessary to fulfil the bonding requirements of nitrogen or they may be linked to the rest of the structure by way of the nitrogen atom. Nitrogen atoms may also be in the form of N-oxides. Sulphur atoms may be in the form of S, S(0) or SO2. In a<br>
20     heterocyclic ring, a -CH2- group can optionally be replaced by a -C(0).<br>
As used herein, the term 'halogen’ includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
  A 'saturated or unsaturated 4- to 10-membered ring, which ring may optionally compr15e <br>
25	one or more heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur' may be a saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated monocyclic or bicyclic ring.

Where the compounds according to the invention contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, the invention includes all stereo15omers, including enantiomers <br>
15     and diastereomers, and mixtures including racemic mixtures thereof. Tautomers and mixtures thereof are also included.<br>
Racemates may be separated into individual enantiomers using known procedures (cf. Advanced Organic Chem15try: 3rd Edition: author J March, pl04-107). A suitable<br>
 20     procedure involves formation of diastereomeric derivatives by reaction of the racemic<br>
material with a chiral auxiliary, followed by separation, for example by chromatography, of the diastereomers and then cleavage of the auxiliary speC1es.<br>
         The compounds according to the invention may be provided as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
25     salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include base salts such as an alkali metal salt for example sodium, an alkaline earth metal salt for example calC1um or magnesium, an organic amine salt for example triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylethylamine or amino aC1ds for example lysine.

Examples of the types of conversion reactions that may be used include introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, aUcylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art and are illustrated in die Examples<br>
15     below. By way of example, a hydroxy group may be replaced with a chloro group by<br>
reaction with a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride and the chloro group may itself undergo nucleophilic substitution. Alternatively a chloro substituent may be treated with sodium azide to replace the chloro group with an azido group which in turn may be reduced to an amine group. Amine groups may conveniently be acylated with aC1d chlorides or<br>
20     15ocyanates and converted into amides by treatment with appropriate aC1ds.<br>
It will be appreC1ated that certain functional groups may need to be protected using standard protecting groups. The protection and deprotection of functional groups 15 for example, described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chem15try', edited by J. W. F. McOmie, Plenum <br>
