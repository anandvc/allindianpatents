TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"Improved System to Maintain Coolant Steady State"<br>
(a) Gawande Avinash Anandrao<br>
(b) residing at<br>
29, Sambhaji Society, Senapati bapat Road Pune 411 016 State of Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system to control, regulate and maintain steady state of coolant at the engine inlet for engine testing.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Modern engine test houses measure engine output precisely using advanced dynamometer systems. To achieve this accuracy maintaining and controlling coolant physical properties / parameters such as temperature, pressure and flow is of paramount importance in reliable and authenticated engine tests to achieve compliance with established standard. The performance of the engine is a strong function of the coolant input condition such as temperature and pressure. The variation in the temperature would affect various performance parameters such as exhaust gas emission level, specific fuel consumption etc. of the engine during the testing resulting in unreliable results. Various engine testing standards insists on maintaining constant fuel temperature for certification of engine, performance comparison of various engines, emission test and development evaluation.<br>
The configuration of the conventional systems does not facilitate separation of impurities from the coolant. Further, there is no means for prohibiting formation of high temperature steam pockets in the engine jacket.<br>
Thus the study of the related prior art reveals several technological gaps such<br>
as:<br>
	Lack of provision for maintaining steady state of the coolant when engine<br>
/ facility coolant demand is not there<br>
	Lack of provision for rapid heating of the coolant without circulating the<br>
same in the system<br>
	Lack of provision for providing thermal shock that is supplying coolant at<br>
the defined extreme conditions over the defined time cycle.<br>
	No provision for separation of impurities from the coolant<br>
	Lack of provision to protect engine cavities against corrosion<br>
2    14 JUN 2007<br><br>
Lack of provision to avoid generation of high temperature steam pockets in engine jacket            No provision for preheating the coolant<br>
Necessity has constantly been felt to develop a system to control and maintain steady state that is temperature and pressure of coolant for engine test.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a system to control and maintain steady state that is temperature and pressure of coolant for engine test.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide continuous re-circulation of the coolant while maintaining its steady state though the coolant demand from the engine / facility is not there.<br>
Another object of the invention is to facilitate rapid heating of the coolant without circulating it in the system till the desired temperature is reached to reduce time.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to facilitate thermal shock to the engine / facility wherein coolant at extreme defined temperatures is periodically supplied to the engine / facility according to defined time cycle.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to obviate generation of high temperature steam pockets in engine jacket<br>

The coolant in the conduit 3 passes to the engine / facility (not shown), the coolant from the engine passes through the coolant return conduit 4 to the unit 1. This unit comprises of multi-way valves that facilitate isolation of the system from the engine or by-pass of the coolant to the conduit 4 as well to re-circulate the coolant when there is no coolant demand from the engine / facility. When by-pass facility is not used the coolant from the conduit 4 is passed conduit 5 and further to 6. The coolant from the said pressure and flow regulating means 1 passes through the conduit 5 to the conduit 6 which is disposed verticaliy wherein the filter 7 is mounted at the top of the said conduit 6 that is optionally provided with flow switch with indicator 21. The expansion tank 8 is disposed adjacent to the said filter 7 via passage 9 as shown in the Figure. There is a provision to mount a flow switch with indicator in the said passage 9. Air vent means 10 and 11 is provided on the said expansion tank 8 and the filter respectively. The steam generated in the coolant or air trapped is vented out through he airvent means 10 and 11. Flow path of the coolant is indicated by dashed line 50. The said expansion tank 8 is provided with a level indicator 12 and a coolant filling provision 13 that is automatic or manually operated. The coolant from the expansion tank 8 flows downwards in the heat transfer device 14 which is mounted vertically. It comprises of heat transfer element 15 wherein another fluid at a temperature lower than coolant temperature flows in it, and its flow rate is controlled by the control valve 18. A pressure relief valve is in connection with 18 to release the fluid in case of high pressures in the system.     Provision 16 mounted at the<br>
14 JUN 2007<br><br>
bottom of the said heat transfer device 14 separates impurities from the coolant. Further coolant is circulated in the system and engine / facility using the coolant circulating means 17. The control unit 19 is in connection with the system components as shown in the Figure.<br>
In one of the embodiments the pressure relief valve in the said pressure and flow regulating means 1 operates such that the coolant from 16 to 1 is diverted to the conduit 5 and is re-circulated continuously in the system itself to maintain steady state and not supplied to the engine / facility through 3 when there is no coolant demand from the engine /facility.<br>
In yet another embodiment rapid engine heating provision comprising one or plurality of multi-way valves are provided on the conduit 3 and / or 4 to achieve substantially rapid engine heating when desired.
