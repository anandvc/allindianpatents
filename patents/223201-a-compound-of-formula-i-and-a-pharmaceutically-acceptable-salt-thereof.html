The present invention relates to diaryl 1,2,4-triazole derivatives as a highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Most of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs represent<br>
actions such as anti-inflammation, analgesic, and<br>
antipyretic activity by inhibiting the enzymatic activity<br>
of     cyclooxygenase     or     prostaglandin     G/H     synthase.	In<br>
addition, they can suppress the uterine contraction induced<br>
by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of<br>
cancers. First, only cyclooxygenase-1 was known to be<br>
found in cow as a constitutional enzyme. But recently,<br>
cyclooxygenase-2 is identified to be discriminated clearly<br>
from cyclooxygenase-1 and can be provoked easily by mitogen,<br>
endotoxin, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like.<br>
Prostagladins        have        various        pathological	and<br>
physiological functions. Precisely, cyciooxygenase-1 as a constitutional enzyme participates in the secretion of basic endogenous prostaglandin and plays an important role in physiological  aspects  such as  stomach homeostasis,   renal<br><br>
blood circulation and so on. On the other hand, cyclooxygenase-2 is induced by inflammatory factors, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like, and thus plays an important role in pathological effects of prostaglandins. Therefore, selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 are expected to have no side effect on account of the functional mechanism compared with the anti¬inflammatory drugs such as conventional non-steroid agents and to represent actions such as anti-inflammation, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. Furthermore, it is estimated to suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. Especially, it probably has a few side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity and the like. Also, it is assumed to prevent the synthesis of contractive prostanoids, and thus inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle induced by the prostanoid. Hence, it can be applied usefully to treat a premature birth, dysmenorrhea, asthma and several diseases associated with eosinophilic leukocytes. Besides, it can be widely exploited to cure osteoporosis, glaucoma and athymia, which has been disclosed in many references, especially the usefulness of selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 [References: John Vane, "Towards a better aspirin" in Nature, Vol.367, p215-216, 1994; Bruno Battistini, Regina Betting and Y. S. Bakhle, "COX-1 and COX-2: Toward the Development of More Selective NSAIDs" in Drug News    and<br><br>
Perspectives, Vol. 7, p501-512, 1994; David B. Reitz and Karen Seibert, "Selective Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors" in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, James A. Bristol, Editor, Vol. 30, pl79-188, 1995).<br>
The selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 have been reported to have various structure forms. Among these, the diaryl heterocycle structure, namely a tricyclic system, has been studied most frequently and exploited to construct a lot of candidate substances, In this structure, it is essential that sulfonamide or methanesuIfone group exist onto one phenyl group. The initial substance having the above structure is identified to be Dup697 (Bioorganic s Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol 5, No. 18, p2123, 1995). Then, as a derivative, SC-58635 (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol 40, pl347, 1997} having a pyrrazole structure, MK-966 (WO 95/00501) having a furanone structure and the like are disclosed.<br>

(1) Experimental procedure<br>
In order to investigate pharmacologically the selective inhibition activity against cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme, the inhibitive effects against cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were measured by two methods as follows.<br>
First, the cyclooxygenase-1 was examined by using U-937 through the following procedure.<br>
The cultured U-937 (humane lymphoma cell, obtained from Korean cell line bank) was centrifuged to collect the pellet. Then, the pellet was diluted with IxHBSS (Hanky's balanced salt solutin) at the concentration of 1x10 cells/ml, and 1ml of them was transferred into each well of 12-well plates, and then dissolved with DMSO. 5yfi of the diluted sample solution, and bid of DMSO vehicle were added therein and mixed, and the mixture was cultured at 37°C in CO2 incubator for 15 minutes. Arachidonic acid as a substrate was dissolved in ethanol to prepare a stock solution with a concentration of lOmM, followed by diluting with 1XHBSS to prepare the solution of ImM. lOM of litiM Arachidonic acid solution was added to each of the treated wells, and the mixture was cultured at 37 in CO2 incubator for 30 minutes. The cell solution of each well was collected in the centrifuge tube and was centrifuged at 4 X for 5 minutes at 10, OOOrpm. As PGE2 existed in the supernatant separated from collected cell, the concentration of PGE2 was quantitated by using monoclonal kit from Cayman Chemicals, and the concentration of samples<br><br>
and vehicle were compared to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-1. Ultimately, the inhibition effect against the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme was  obtained  from the   result.<br>
Second,     the    cyclooxygenase-2    was    examined    by    using Raw 264.7   through  the   following procedure.<br>
After seeding 2x10 cells of Raw 264.7 cell(obtained from Korean cell line bank) into each of 12-well plates, the wells was treated with aspirin 250 y M and cultured at 37°C in CO2 incubator for 2 hours. And then, each samples were replaced with new media and cultured for 30 minutes. In addition, the samples was treated with 100 units/ml of interferon y and lOOng/ml of lipopolysaccharide(LPS), and cultured for 18 hours. Then, the media was transferred to other tubes and the PGE 2 was quantitated by using EIA kit from Cayman  Chemicals.<br>
(2)   Experimental   results<br>
The   experimental   results   were   described   in   Table   1   as<br>
follows.<br><br><br>
In    vitro    experiments    were    observed    to    measure    the<br>
inhibitional	ratios	against	cyclooxygenase-1	and<br>
cyclooxygenase-2.     Consequently,   in  case   of  the   compound  of Example   4,     6,     9    and   31,    the    inhibition    effect   against<br><br>
cyclooxygenase-2 and cyclooxygenase-1 was identified to be similar level in low concentration when comparing with a comparative substance, Celecoxib, which was examined under the same condition. So to speak, the selectivity of the cyclooxygenase-2 is hardly different between the Example and the  comparative   substance-<br>
Meanwhile, In case of the compound of Example 14, 6-( 3-methyi-5-phenyl- [1,2,4]triazole-1-yl)-prydine-3-sulfonic acid amide, the inhibition effect against cyclooxygenase-2 was identified to be more excellent in low concentration than a comparative substance, whereas the inhibition effect against cyclooxygenase-1 was much lower level than a comparative substance. That is to say, the selectivity of cyclooxygenase-2 is confirmed to be better than any other substances, which proves the structural efficacy of diaryl 1,2,4-triazole   derivatives   in  the  present   invention.<br>
INDUSTRIAL RPPLICRBILITY<br>
As demonstrated and confirmed above, the novel<br>
compound of bipyridinyl derivative is a drug substitute<br>
improving side effects of anti-inflammatory drug in<br>
conventional non-steroids, and is useful for patients<br>
