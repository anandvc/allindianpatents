				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to force terminal for having a contact frame, in which an<br>
electrical conductor cab be clamped against the contact frame by means of a<br>
clamping spring extending in the form of an arc over the contact frame. The<br>
invention further relates to a service switching device having a spring force<br>
terminal.<br>
Spring force terminals of the generic type are used, for example, as a connecting<br>
apparatus for electrical incoming and outgoing conductors in service switching<br>
devices in order to produce an electrical and mechanical connection between the<br>
conductors and the service switching device without the aid of a tool. Service<br>
switching devices may be, for example, circuit breakers having thermal and<br>
magnetic releases for ensuring overload and short-circuit protection in<br>
downstream circuits.<br>
DE 198 927 C1 discloses such a generic spring force terminal. There, an electrical<br>
conductor is pushed into a rectangular cutout in a busbar, which has been<br>
inserted in a terminal housing, by means of a leaf spring against the upper edge<br>
of the cutout.<br>
However, it is not possible for contact to be made in a simple and reliable<br>
manner with two or more conductors with such a spring force terminal.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a spring force<br>
terminal and a service switching device with which the connection of one or<br>
more conductors is simplified and made more reliable.<br><br>
The object is achieved with respect to the spring force terminal and the service<br>
switching device according to the features of the invention.<br>
According to the invention, the contact frame thus has two or more plug<br>
openings and a retaining opening. The clamping spring is held at a first free end<br>
in the retaining opening on the contact frame. At its second free end, it is divided<br>
into a number of finger-like projections which corresponds to the number of plug<br>
openings by means of one or more slot-like cutouts such that each of the<br>
projections is passed through in each case one of the plug openings, and a<br>
conductor cab be clamped tightly in each of the plug openings by in each case<br>
one of the projections.<br>
The advantage of the spring force terminal according to the invention is that in<br>
each case a dedicated plug opening is provided for a conductor to be connected,<br>
and a conductor cab be clamped tightly in said plug opening by means of a<br>
projection, associated with this plug opening, of the clamping spring, irrespective<br>
of whether there are also conductors in that or in the other plug openings. The<br>
clamping spring is a single component which is divided up into two or more<br>
functionally identical but physically separated spring elements, which also<br>
function independently of one another, by means of the slot-like cutouts. For<br>
example, in the case of two plug openings, a conductor can be clamped tightly in<br>
one of the two plug openings but not in the other. Subsequently, one second<br>
conductor can also be inserted in the second plug opening and/or the first<br>
conductor can be removed again<br><br>
from the first plug opening.<br>
One further advantage of the spring force terminal<br>
according to the invention is the simple way in which<br>
the clamping spring can be mounted. Said clamping<br>
spring can be inserted in the retaining opening with<br>
its free end, which is matched to the retaining<br>
opening, and is held on the contact frame.<br>
In one particularly advantageous variant of the spring<br>
force terminal according to the invention, the contact<br>
frame has two plug openings and a retaining opening,<br>
and the clamping spring is held at a first free end in<br>
the retaining opening on the contact frame, and, at its<br>
second free end, is divided into two finger-like<br>
projections by means of a slot-like cutout such that<br>
each of the two projections is passed through in each<br>
case one of the plug openings, and a conductor can be<br>
clamped tightly in each of the two plug openings by in<br>
each case one of the projections. This embodiment is<br>
particularly space-saving and covers a large proportion<br>
of service switching device applications.<br>
The contact frame is divided in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner into plug openings and a retaining<br>
opening by means of webs. One of the webs may in this<br>
case at the same time be a means for protecting the<br>
spring projections from being overextended. This means<br>
that this web limits the maximum spring travel such<br>
that the clamping spring cannot be deformed beyond a<br>
maximum permissible range. This ensures that the<br>
clamping spring always has a constant clamping force<br>
action.<br>
Two webs may in this case be arranged in the contact<br>
frame as the transverse web and the longitudinal web in<br>
the form of a T so as to produce, as a result, two plug<br>
openings and a retaining opening. The retaining opening<br><br>
may then be arranged, for example, above the transverse<br>
web, and the plug openings may be arranged below the<br>
transverse web and on both sides of the longitudinal<br>
web in the contact frame. In this case, the transverse<br>
web acts as a means for protecting the spring<br>
projections of the clamping spring from being<br>
overextended.<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the<br>
clamping spring is bent in the form of a U.<br>
In an even more particularly advantageous embodiment,<br>
the clamping spring may also be provided with a slot in<br>
the longitudinal direction on a subsection starting<br>
from the branch of the spring projections in the<br>
direction of the first free end of said clamping<br>
spring. The advantage of such an additional slot is the<br>
fact that further means are provided for separating the<br>
individual spring projections from one another.<br>
It is further advantageous if the contact frame has a<br>
rectangular outer contour, and also the plug openings<br>
and the retaining opening are rectangular.<br>
One free end of the contact frame may in a very<br>
advantageous manner be in the form of a connecting part<br>
for fixing an electrical outgoing conductor and may be<br>
oriented in the insertion direction of the conductor.<br>
The outgoing conductor, which, for example when using<br>
the spring force terminal according to the invention as<br>
the connecting terminal in a service switching device,<br>
is the conductor of the inner main current path, can<br>
be, for example, welded to this connecting part. The<br>
orientation of the connecting part in the insertion<br>
direction of the conductor to be inserted brings about<br>
a further space saving when installing the spring force<br>
terminal according to the invention in a service<br>
switching device.<br><br>
An adjustment contact part, for example in the form of<br>
a metal sheet bent in the form of a U, may also be<br>
integrally formed on that end of the contact part which<br>
lies opposite the connecting part. Such an adjustment<br>
contact part is required when automatic adjustment<br>
measures are carried out in the course of the<br>
production of service switching devices with a thermal<br>
release (bimetallic release) for making contact with<br>
the thermal release. With the spring force terminal<br>
according to the invention, the adjustment contact part<br>
may advantageously be produced in an integrated unit<br>
with the contact body.<br>
Finally, in a further, advantageous refinement of a<br>
spring force terminal according to the invention, the<br>
adjustment contact part forms such an angle with each<br>
of the spring projections that, as a result, a funnel<br>
function is realized in order to make it easier to<br>
insert the conductor end pieces in the plug openings.<br>
A service switching device according to the invention<br>
having at least one spring force terminal according to<br>
the invention is characterized in that the terminal<br>
housing is integrated in the switching device housing.<br>
This may advantageously take place, for example, such<br>
that the spring force terminal is held in the region of<br>
the terminal accommodating area of the service<br>
switching device on the insides of the housing shells.<br>
The advantage of such a service switching device<br>
according to the invention having a spring force<br>
terminal according to the invention lies in its cost-<br>
effective manufacture. The spring force terminal itself<br>
does not require a dedicated insulating housing, as a<br>
result of which the costs per item for this component<br>
are reduced. It can be inserted in the terminal<br>
accommodating area of the housing shells of the service<br>
switching device by machine as a prefabricated<br><br>
assembly, if possible with the outgoing conductor<br>
already welded on, during the course of automated<br>
manufacture of the service switching device. For this<br>
purpose, the housing shells of the service switching<br>
device have corresponding retaining apparatuses,<br>
generally grooves and protrusions, which are matched to<br>
the geometry of the spring force terminal.<br>
Further, advantageous refinements and improvements of<br>
the invention and further advantages are described in<br>
the further subclaims.<br>
The invention and further, advantageous refinements and<br>
improvements of the invention will be explained and<br>
described in more detail with reference to the<br>
drawings, in which one exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention is illustrated and in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a spring force terminal according to<br>
the invention, and<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic of a spring force terminal<br>
according to the invention when installed in<br>
a service switching device according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a spring force terminal 1 having a<br>
rectangular contact frame 3. One free end 5 of the<br>
contact frame is in the form of a likewise rectangular<br>
connecting part 5 and is bent back in the direction of<br>
the clamping spring 7. A rectangular metal contact<br>
sheet 29, which extends over approximately half the<br>
width of the connecting part 5, is integrally formed on<br>
the free end of the connecting part 5. An outgoing<br>
conductor can be fitted, for example welded, to the<br>
metal contact sheet 29 when the spring force terminal<br>
is installed in a service switching device.<br><br>
The contact frame is divided	into two plug openings 9,<br>
11 and a retaining opening	13 by means of two webs<br>
arranged in the form of a T,	a transverse web 31 and a<br>
longitudinal web 33.<br>
The insertion direction of the conductors into the plug<br>
openings is indicated by the arrow E. The clamping<br>
spring 7 which is bent in the form of a U spans the<br>
contact frame in the opposite direction to the<br>
insertion direction E.<br>
The clamping spring 7 is pushed with its first free end<br>
15 into the retaining opening 13 against the retaining<br>
edge 35 of said retaining opening 13 and is thus held<br>
on the contact frame 3. At its other free end, the<br>
clamping spring 7 is divided into two finger-like<br>
spring projections 23, 25, which are passed, starting<br>
from a branch edge 19, through in each case one of the<br>
plug openings 9, 11, by means of a slot-like cutout 17.<br>
The clamping spring 7 is also provided with a<br>
longitudinal slot 21 at the subsection, which extends<br>
from the branch edge 19 in the direction of the<br>
retaining edge 35, in a subregion, starting at the<br>
branch edge 19.<br>
The slot-like cutout 17 and the longitudinal slot 21<br>
mean that it is possible for the spring projections 23,<br>
25 of the clamping spring 7 to be bent independently of<br>
one another without them influencing one another. This<br>
makes it possible for a conductor to be inserted in<br>
each of the two plug openings 9, 11 and clamped tightly<br>
therein by the spring projection 23, 25 associated with<br>
this plug opening, irrespective of whether or not a<br>
conductor has likewise been inserted in the other plug<br>
opening 11, 9. Whether a conductor has been inserted in<br>
one or in both of the plug openings 9, 11 has largely<br>
no influence on the clamping force of the two spring<br><br>
projections 23, 25.<br>
Without a conductor inserted, as illustrated in figure<br>
1,	the spring projections 23, 25 bear against a contact<br>
edge 37 of the plug openings 9, 11 which lies opposite<br>
the transverse web 31.<br>
Adjacent to the contact edge 37, a free end of a limb<br>
of a U-shaped metal sheet 27, whose width corresponds<br>
to the width of the contact frame 3, is integrally<br>
formed on the contact frame 3. The integrally formed<br>
limb forms an obtuse angle a with the contact frame 3.<br>
An acute angle is thus formed between the metal sheet<br>
27 and the spring projections 23, 25 such chat, as a<br>
result, a funnel-shaped insertion guidance is provided<br>
for conductors to be inserted in the plug openings 9,<br>
11.	The function of the metal sheet 27 is that of an<br>
adjustment contact part. If the spring force terminal 1<br>
is installed in a service switching device, the<br>
adjustment contact part realized by the metal sheet 27<br>
serves the purpose of providing an electrical contact<br>
for the automated thermal adjustment of the thermal<br>
release of the service switching device.<br>
The insertion of a connecting conductor is made easier<br>
by the funnel-shaped opening, formed from the spring<br>
projections 23, 25 and the metal sheet 27. A connecting<br>
conductor piece, which is inserted in an insertion<br>
opening 9, 11 against the spring projection 23, 25,<br>
pushes the free end of the spring projection 23, 25<br>
associated with this insertion opening in the direction<br>
of the transverse web 31. Owing to the resetting spring<br>
force, the connecting conductor piece is then pushed by<br>
the free end of the corresponding spring projection 23,<br>
25 against the contact edge 37 such that mechanical and<br>
electrical contact is made.<br>
The transverse web 31 in this case acts as a means for<br><br>
protecting the spring projections 23, 25 from being<br>
overloaded. This is because it is not possible for the<br>
spring projections 23, 25 to be pushed any further than<br>
up to the transverse web 31. This makes it possible to<br>
reliably prevent the spring projections 23, 25 from<br>
being deformed beyond their elastic range and thus<br>
their spring properties from being impaired by<br>
continuous deformation.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic of a spring force terminal<br>
120 according to the invention when installed in the<br>
terminal accommodating area of a service switching<br>
device 100. The service switching device 100 is<br>
illustrated schematically as a plan view of an open<br>
insulating housing shell. The front face 104, the rear<br>
face 106, the rear narrow side 108 and the fixing side<br>
102 are shown. Other essential functional modules of<br>
the service switching device are not illustrated in<br>
figure 2 for reasons of clarity.<br>
The terminal accommodating area is formed in the<br>
housing shells in the region between the rear narrow<br>
side 108, the fixing side 102 and the rear face 106.<br>
The spring force terminal 12 0 is fixed there in the<br>
position shown in figure 2 by retaining apparatuses<br>
(not shown here). Such retaining apparatuses are<br>
generally grooves or protrusions integrally formed on<br>
the inside of the housing shells.<br>
A conductor opening 114 is formed by means of a cutout<br>
in the rear housing narrow side 108. Guide webs 126,<br>
126a protruding into the housing interior form an<br>
insertion funnel, which protrudes out of the conductor<br>
opening 114 into the housing interior and through which<br>
a connecting conductor 128 is passed when its<br>
connecting end, from which the insulation has been<br>
stripped, is inserted in the direction of the plug<br>
opening 124 in the contact frame 125 of the spring<br><br>
force terminal 120.<br>
In addition, on the spring force terminal 12 0 the<br>
connecting end of the connecting conductor 128 is also<br>
passed through the insertion funnel formed from the<br>
spring projection 122, which protrudes into the plug<br>
opening 124, and from the adjustment contact part 134,<br>
which is integrally formed on the contact frame 125,<br>
into the plug opening 124.<br>
The connecting end, from which the insulation has been<br>
stripped, of the connecting conductor 128 is pushed in<br>
a resilient manner against the contact edge 13 0 of the<br>
plug opening 124 in the contact frame 125 by the free<br>
end of the clamping spring 121, which is held at the<br>
retaining edge 132 in the retaining opening 133 and is<br>
bent in the form of a U over the contact frame 12 5,<br>
such that, as a result, the electrical and mechanical<br>
contact is brought about between the connecting<br>
conductor and the spring force terminal.<br>
The clamping spring 121 is prevented from being<br>
overextended by the transverse web 127 in the contact<br>
frame 125, which divides the contact frame into the<br>
retaining opening 133 and the plug openings 124, of<br>
which in this case only one can be seen in the<br>
sectional illustration.<br>
At the same height as the adjustment contact part 134,<br>
a calibration opening 112 is cut out in the rear<br>
housing narrow side 108, and a calibration contact pin<br>
can be brought into contact with the adjustment contact<br>
part 134 through said calibration opening 112 during<br>
automated calibration. When the service switching<br>
device has been completely calibrated, the calibration<br>
opening 112 is then closed by a lid.<br>
At the same height as the clamping spring 121, a<br><br>
release opening 110 is cut out in the rear housing face<br>
106 and is dimensioned such that a conventional<br>
screwdriver passes through. In order to release the<br>
clamping connection, the clamping spring 121 is then<br>
pushed away from the connecting conductor by a<br>
screwdriver passed through the release opening 110 such<br>
that the connecting conductor 128 can be removed. In<br>
this case, the transverse web 127 again also prevents<br>
the clamping spring 121 from being overextended.<br>
An outgoing conductor 13 6 is welded to the connecting<br>
part 13 5, which is bent at an obtuse angle in the<br>
direction of the inserted connecting conductor 128, of<br>
the contact frame 125.<br><br>

one free end of the contact frame (3) is in the form of a connecting part<br>
(5) for fixing an electrical outgoing conductor and is oriented in the<br>
insertion direction E of the conductor.<br>
12.	A spring force terminal as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein<br>
an adjustment contact part (27) is integrally formed on the contact frame<br>
(3).<br>
13.	A spring force terminal as claimed in Claim 12, wherein the adjustment<br>
contact part (27) is a bent metal sheet which is integrally formed on that<br>
end of the contact frame (3) which lies opposite to the connecting part<br>
(5).<br><br>
14.	A spring force terminal as Claimed in claim 13, wherein the adjustment<br>
contact part (27) forms such an angle with each of the spring projections<br>
(23, 25) so as to realize a funnel function which makes it easier to insert<br>
the conductor end pieces in the plug openings (9,11).<br>
15.	A service switching device (100) comprising at least one spring force<br>
terminal (120) as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 14, wherein the terminal<br>
housing is integrated in the switching device housing, and wherein the<br>
spring force terminal (120) is held in the region of the terminal<br>
accommodating area of the service switching device on the insides of the<br>
housing.<br><br>
The invention relates to a spring force terminal (1) for<br>
connecting electrical conductors, comprising a contact frame (3),<br>
in which an electrical conductor can be clamped against the<br>
contact frame by means of a damping spring (7) extending in the<br>
form of an arc over the contact frame. The contact frame (3) has<br>
two or more plug openings (19,11) and a retaining opening (13),<br>
in that the clamping spring (7) is held at a first free end in<br>
the retaining opening (13) on the contact frame, in that, at its<br>
second free end, the clamping spring is divided into a number of<br>
finger-like projections (23,25) which correspond to the number of<br>
plug openings by means of one or more slot—like cutouts (17), and<br>
in that each of the projections (23,25) is passed through one of<br>
the plug openings (9,11), and a conductor can be clamped tightly<br>
in each of the plug openings (9,11) by one of the projections<br>
(23,29).</td>
