2.        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Classically, as devastating agents of disease, paramyxoviruses account for many animal and human deaths worldwide each year. The Paramyxoviridae form a family within the order of Mononegavirales (negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses), consisting of the sub-families Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. The latter sub-family is at present taxonomically divided in the genera Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus (Pringle, 1999, Arch. Virol. 144/2, 2065-2070). Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), a species of the Pneumovirus genus, is the single most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections during infancy and early childhood worldwide (Domachowske, &amp; Rosenberg, 1999, Clin. Microbio. Rev. 12(2): 298-309). Other members of the Pneumovirus genus include the bovine and ovine respiratory syncytial viruses and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM).<br>
In the past decades several etiological agents of mammalian disease, in particular of respiratory tract illnesses (RTI), in particular of humans, have been identified (Evans, In: Viral Infections of Humans, Epidemiology and Control. 3th edn. (ed. Evans, A.S) 22-28 (Plenum Publishing Corporation, New York, 1989)). Classical etiological agents of RTI with mammals are respiratory syncytial viruses belonging to the genus Pneumovirus found with humans (hRSV) and ruminants such as cattle or sheep (bRSV and/or oRSV). In human RSV differences in reciprocal cross neutralization assays, reactivity of the G proteins in immunological assays and nucleotide sequences of the G gene are used to define two hRSV antigenic subgroups. Within the subgroups the amino acid sequences show 94 % (subgroup A) or 98% (subgroup B) identity, while only 53% amino acid sequence identity is found between the subgroups. Additional variability is observed within subgroups based on monoclonal antibodies, RT-PCR assays and RNAse protection assays. Viruses fi'om both subgroups have a worldwide distribution and may occur during a single season. Infection may occur in the presence of pre-existing immunity and the antigenic variation is not strictly required to allow re-infection. See, for example Sullender, 2000, Clinical Microbiology Reviews 13(1): 1-15; Collins et al. Fields Virology, ed. B.N. Knipe, Howley, P.M. 1996, Philadelphia: Lippencott-Raven. 1313-1351; Johnson et al., 1987, (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 84(16): 5625-9; Collins, in The Paramyxoviruses, D.W. Kingsbury, Editor. 1991, Plenum Press: New York. p. 103-153.<br><br>
Another classical Pneumovirus is the pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), in general only found with laboratory mice. However, a proportion of the illnesses observed among mammals can still not be attributed to known pathogens.<br>
2.1       AVIAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS<br>
Respiratory disease caused by an avian pneumovirus (APV) was first described in South Africa in the late 1970s (Buys et al., 1980, Turkey 28:36-46) where it had a devastating effect on the turkey industry. The disease in turkeys was characterized by sinusitis and rhinitis and was called turkey rhi no tracheitis (TRT). The European isolates of APV have also been strongly implicated as factors in swollen head syndrome (SHS) in chickens (O'Brien, 1985, Vet. Rec. 117:619-620). Originally, the disease appeared in broiler chicken flocks infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and was assumed to be a secondary problem associated with Newcastle disease (ND). Antibody against European APV was detected in affected chickens after the onset of SHS (Cook et al., 1988, Avian Pathol. 17:403-410), thus implicating APV as the cause.<br>
Avian pneumovirus (APV) also known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), the aetiological agent of avian rhinotracheitis, an uppt' respiratory tract infection of turkeys (Giraud et al., 1986, Vet. Res. 119:606-607), is the sole member of the recently assigned Metapneumovims genus, which, as said was until now not associated with infections, or what is more, with disease of mammals. Serological subgroups of APV can be differentiated on the basis of nucleotide or amino acid sequences of the G glycoprotein and neutralization tests using monoclonal antibodies that also recognize the G glycoprotein. However, other differences in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences can be used to distinguish serological subgroups of APV. Within subgroups A, B and D, the G protein shows 98.5 to 99.7% aa sequence identity within subgroups while between the subgroups only 31.2- 38% aa identity is observed. See for example Collins et al., 1993, Avian Pathology, 22: p. 469-479; Cook et al., 1993, Avian Pathology, 22: 257-273; Bayon-Auboyer et al., J Gen Virol, 81(Pt 11): 2723-33; Seal, 1998, Virus Res, 58(1-2): 45-52; Bayon-Auboyer et al., 1999, Arch Virol, 144(6): 91-109; Juhasz, et al., 1994, J Gen Virol, 75(Pt 11): 2873-80.<br>
A further serotype of APV is provided in WOOO/20600, incorporated by reference herein, which describes the Colorado isolate of APV and compared it to known APV or TRT<br><br>
strains with in vitro serum neutralization tests. First, the Colorado isolate was tested against monospecific polyclonal antisera to recognized TRT isolates. The Colorado isolate was not neutralized by monospecific antisera to any of the TRT strains. It was, however, neutralized by a hyperimmune antiserum raised against a subgroup A strain. This antiserum neutralized the homologous virus to a titre of 1:400 and the Colorado isolate to a titer of 1: 80. Using the above method, the Colorado isolate was then tested against TRT monoclonal antibodies. In each case, the reciprocal neutralization titer was 
The Colorado strain of APV does not protect SPF chicks against challenge with either a subgroup A or a subgroup B strain of TRT virus. These results suggest that the Colorado isolate may be the first example of a further serotype of avian pneumovirus (See, Bayon-Auboyer et al., 2000, J. Gen. Vir. 81:2723-2733).<br>
The avian pneumovirus is a single stranded, non-segmented RNA virus that belongs to the sub-family Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus metapneumovirus (Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988, Virus Res. 11:241-256; Ling et al., 1992, J. Gen. Virol. 73:1709-1715; Yu et al., 1992, J. Gen. Virol. 73:1355-1363). The Paramyxoviridae family is divided into two sub-families: the Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. The subfamily Paramyxovirinae includes, but is not limited to, the genera: Paramyxovirus, Rubulavirus, and Morbillivirus. Recently, the sub-family Pneumovirinae was divided into two genera based on gene order, and sequence homology, i.e. pneumovirus and metapneumovirus (Naylor et al., 1998, J. Gen. Virol., 79:1393-1398; Pringle, 1998, Arch. Virol. 143:1449-1159). The pneumovirus genus includes, but is not limited to, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV), ovine respiratory syncytial virus, and mouse pneumovirus. The metapneumovirus genus includes, but is not limited to, European avian pneumovirus (subgroups A and B), which is distinguished fi-om hRSV, the type species for the genus pneumovirus (Naylor et al., 1998, J. Gen. Virol., 79:1393-1398; Pringle, 1998, Arch. Virol. 143:1449-1159). The US isolate of APV represents a third subgroup (subgroup C) within metapneumovirus genus because it has been found to be antigenically and genetically different fi-om European isolates (Seal, 1998, Virus Res. 58:45-52; Senne et al., 1998, In: Proc. 47th WPDC, California, pp. 67-68).<br><br>
Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained APV reveals pleomorphic, sometimes spherical, virions ranging from 80 to 200 nm in diameter with long filaments ranging from 1000 to 2000 nm in length (Collins and Gough, 1988, J. Gen. Virol. 69:909-916). The envelope is made of a membrane studded with spikes 13 to 15 nm in length. The nucleocapsid is helical, 14 nm in diameter and has 7 nm pitch. The nucleocapsid diameter is smaller than that of the genera Paramyxovirus and Morbillivirus, which usually have diameters of about 18 nm.<br>
Avian pneumovirus infection is an emerging disease in the USA despite its presence elsewhere in the world in poultry for many years. In May 1996, a highly contagious respiratory disease of turkeys appeared in Colorado, and an APV was subsequently isolated at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa (Senne et al., 1997, Proc. 134th Ann. Mtg., AVMA, pp. 190). Prior to this time, the United States and Canada were considered free of avian pneumovirus (Pearson et al., 1993, In: Newly Emerging and Re-emerging Avian Diseases: Applied Research and Practical Applications for Diagnosis and Control, pp. 78-83; Hecker and Myers, 1993, Vet. Rec. 132:172). Early in 1997, the presence of APV was detected serologically in turkeys in Minnesota. By the time the first confirmed diagnosis was made, APV infections had already spread to many farms. The disease is associated with clinical signs in the upper respiratory tract: foamy eyes, nasal discharge and swelling of the sinuses. It is exacerbated by secondary infections. Morbidity in infected birds can be as high as 100%. The mortality can range from 1 to 90% and is highest in six to twelve week old poults.<br>
Avian pneumovirus is transmitted by contact. Nasal discharge, movement of affected birds, contaminated water, contaminated equipment; contaminated feed trucks and load-out activities can contribute to the transmission of the virus. Recovered turkeys are thought to be carriers. Because the virus is shown to infect the epithelium of the oviduct of laying turkeys and because APV has been detected in young poults, egg transmission is considered a possibility.<br>
2.2       PIV INFECTIONS<br>
Parainfluenza viral infection results in serious respiratory tract disease in infants and children. (Tao et al., 1999, Vaccine 17: 1100-08). Infectious parainfluenza viral infections<br><br>
account for approximately 20% of all hospitalizations of pediatric patients suffering from respiratory tract infections worldwide. Id.<br>
PFV is a member of the genus respirovirus (PIVl, PIVS) or rubulavirus (PrV2, PIV4) of the paramyxoviridae family. PIV is made up of two structural modules: (1) an internal ribonucleoprotein core, or nucleocapsid, containing the viral genome, and (2) an outer, roughly spherical lipoprotein envelope. Its genome is a single strand of negative sense RNA, approximately 15,456 nucleotides in length, encoding at least eight polypeptides. These proteins include, but are not limited to, the nucleocapsid structural protein (NP, NC, or N depending on the genera), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the fusion glycoprotein (F), the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein (HN), the large polymerase protein (L), and the C and D proteins of unknown function. Id.<br>
The parainfluenza nucleocapsid protein (NP, NC, or N) consists of two domains within each protein unit including an amino-terminal domain, comprising about two-thirds of the molecule, which interacts directly with the RNA, and a carboxyl-terminal domain, which lies on the surface of the assembled nucleocapsid. A hinge is thought to exist at the junction of these two domains thereby imparting some flexibility to this protein (see Fields et al. (ed.), 1991, Fundamental Virology, Second Edition, Raven Press, New York, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The matrix protein (M), is apparently involved with viral assembly and interacts with both the viral membrane as well as the nucleocapsid proteins. The phosphoprotein (P), which is subject to phosphorylation, is thought to play a regulatory role in transcription, and may also be involved in methylation, phosphorylation and polyadenylation. The fusion glycoprotein (F) interacts with the viral membrane and is first produced as an inactive precursor, then cleaved post-translationally to produce two disulfide linked polypeptides. The active F protein is also involved in penetration of the parainfluenza virion into host cells by facilitating fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell plasma membrane. Id. The glycoprotein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), protrudes from the envelope allowing the virus to contain both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. HN is strongly hydrophobic at its amino terminal which functions to anchor the HN protein into the lipid bilayer. Id. Finally, the large polymerase protein (L) plays an important role in both transcription and replication. Id.<br><br>
2.3       RSV INFECTIONS<br>
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children (Feigen et al, eds., 1987, hi: Textbook of Pediatric hifectious Diseases, WB Saunders, Philadelphia at pages 1653-1675; New Vaccine Development, Establishing Priorities, Vol. 1, 1985, National Academy Press, Washington DC at pages 397-409; and Ruuskanen et al, 1993, Curr. Probl. Pediatr. 23:50-79). The yearly epidemic nature of RSV infection is evident worldwide, but the incidence and severity of RSV disease in a given season vary by region (Hall, 1993, Contemp. Pediatr. 10:92-110). In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it usually begins in late fall and ends in late spring. Primary RSV infection occurs most often in children from 6 weeks to 2 years of age and uncommonly in the first 4 weeks of life during nosocomial epidemics (Hall et al., 1979, New Engl. J. Med. 300:393-396). Children at increased risk for RSV infection include, but are not limited to, preterm infants (Hall et al, 1979, New Engl. J. Med. 300:393-396) and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Groothuis et al., 1988, Pediatrics 82:199-203), congenital heart disease (MacDonald et al.. New Engl. J. Med. 307:397-400), congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (Ogra et al., 1988, Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 7:246-249; and Pohl et al., 1992, J. Infect. Dis. 165:166-169), and cystic fibrosis (Abman et al., 1988, J. Pediatr. 113:826-830). The fatality rate in infants with heart or lung disease who are hospitalized with RSV infection is 3%-4% (Navas et al., 1992, J. Pediatr. 121:348-354).<br>
RSV infects adults as well as infants and children. In healthy adults, RSV causes predominantly upper respiratory tract disease. It has recently become evident that some adults, especially the elderly, have symptomatic RSV infections more frequently than had been previously reported (Evans, A.S., eds., 1989, Viral Infections of Humans. Epidemiology and Control, 3rd ed., Plenum Medical Book, New York at pages 525-544). Several epidemics also have been reported among nursing home patients and institutionalized young aduhs (Falsey, A.R., 1991, Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 12:602-608; and Garvie et al., 1980, Br. Med. J. 281:1253-1254). Finally, RSV may cause serious disease in immunosuppressed persons, particularly bone marrow transplant patients (Hertz et al., 1989, Medicine 68:269-281).<br>
Treatment options for established RSV disease are limited. Severe RSV disease of the lower respiratory tract often requires considerable supportive care, including<br><br>
administration of humidified oxygen and respiratory assistance (Fields et al., eds, 1990, Fields Virology, 2nd ed.. Vol. 1, Raven Press, New York at pages 1045-1072).<br>
While a vaccine might prevent RSV infection, and/or RSV-related disease, no vaccine is yet licensed for this indication. A major obstacle to vaccine development is safety. A formalin-inactivated vaccine, though immunogenic, unexpectedly caused a higher and more severe incidence of lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV in immunized infants than in infants immunized with a similarly prepared trivalent parainfluenza vaccine (Kim et al., 1969, Am. J. Epidemiol. 89:422-434; and Kapikian et al., 1969, Am. J. Epidemiol. 89:405-421). Several candidate RSV vaccines have been abandoned and others are under development (Murphy et al., 1994, Virus Res. 32:13-36), but even if safety issues are resolved, vaccine efficacy must also be improved. A number of problems remain to be solved. Immunization would be required in the immediate neonatal period since the peak incidence of lower respiratory tract disease occurs at 2-5 months of age. The immaturity of the neonatal immune response together with high titers of maternally acquired RSV antibody may be expected to reduce vaccine immunogenicity in the neonatal period (Murphy et al., 1988, J. Virol. 62:3907-3910; and Murphy et al., 1991, Vaccine 9:185-189). Finally, primary RSV infection and disease do not protect well against subsequent RSV disease (Henderson et al., 1979, New Engl. J. Med. 300:530-534).<br>
Currently, the only approved approach to prophylaxis of RSV disease is passive immunization. Initial evidence suggesting a protective role for IgG was obtained from observations involving maternal antibody in ferrets (Prince, G.A., Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1975) and humans (Lambrecht et al, 1976, J. Infect. Dis. 134:211-217; and Glezen et al, 1981, J. Pediatr. 98:708-715). Hemming et al. (Morell et al, eds., 1986, Clinical Use of Intravenous Immunoglobulins, Academic Press, London at pages 285-294) recognized the possible utility of RSV antibody in treatment or prevention of RSV infection during studies involving the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous immune globulin (FVIG) in newborns suspected of having neonatal sepsis. In this study, it was noted that one infant, whose respiratory secretions yielded RSV, recovered rapidly after FVIG infusion. Subsequent analysis of the IVIG lot revealed an unusually high titer of RSV neutralizing antibody. This same group of investigators then examined the ability of hyperimmune serum or immune globulin, enriched for RSV neutralizing antibody, to protect cotton rats and<br><br>
primates against RSV infection (Prince et al., 1985, Virus Res. 3:193-206; Prince et al., 1990, J. Virol. 64:3091-3092; Hemming et al., 1985, J. Infect. Dis. 152:1083-1087; Prince et al., 1983, Infect. Immun. 42:81-87; and Prince et al., 1985, J. Virol. 55:517-520). Results of these studies indicate that IVIG may be used to prevent RSV infection, in addition to treating or preventing RSV-reiated disorders.<br>
Recent chnical studies have demonstrated the ability of this passively administered RSV hyperimmune globulin (RSV IVIG) to protect at-risk children from severe lower respiratory infection by RSV (Groothius et al, 1993, New Engl. J. Med. 329:1524-1530; and The PREVENT Study Group, 1997, Pediatrics 99:93-99). While this is a major advance in preventing RSV infection, this treatment poses certain limitations in its widespread use. First, RSV D/IG must be infused intravenously over several hours to achieve an effective dose. Second, the concentrations of active material in hyperimmune globulins are insufficient to treat adults at risk or most children with comprised cardiopulmonary function. Third, intravenous infusion necessitates monthly hospital visits during the RSV season. Finally, it may prove difficult to select sufficient donors to produce a hyperimmune globulin for RSV to meet the demand for this product. Currently, only approximately 8% of normal donors have RSV neutralizing antibody titers high enough to qualify for the production of hyperimmune globulin.<br>
One way to improve the specific activity of the immunoglobulin would be to develop one or more highly potent RSV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Such MAbs should be human or humanized in order to retain favorable pharmacokinetics and to avoid generating a human anti-mouse antibody response, as repeat dosing would be required throughout the RSV season.

5.1       MAMMALIAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS<br>
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A MAMMALIAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS<br>
The invention provides a mammalian MPV. The mammalian MPV is a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the suh-f&amp;mily Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae. Moreover, the mammalian MPV is identifiable as phylogenetically corresponding to the genus Metapneumovirus, wherein the mammalian MPV is phylogenetically more closely related to a virus isolate deposited as 1-2614 with CNCM, Paris (SEQ ID NO: 19) than to turkey rhinotracheitis virus, the etiological agent of avian rhinotracheitis. A virus is identifiable as phylogenetically corresponding to the genus<br><br>
Metapneumovirus by, e.g., obtaining nucleic acid sequence information of the virus and testing it in phylogenetic analyses. Any technique known to the skilled artisan can be used to determine phylogenetic relationships between strains of viruses. For exemplary methods see section 5.9. Other techniques are disclosed in International Patent Application PCT/NL02/00040, published as WO 02/057302, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. In particular, PCT/NL02/00040 discloses nucleic acid sequences that are suitable for phylogenetic analysis at page 12, line 27 to page 19, line 29, which are incorporated by reference herein. A virus can fiirther be identified as a mammalian MPV on the basis of sequence similarity as described in more detail below.<br>
In addition to phylogenetic relatedness and sequence similarity of a virus to a mammalian MPV as disclosed herein, the similarity of the genomic organization of a virus to the genomic organization of a mammalian MPV disclosed herein can also be used to identify the virus as a mammalian MPV. For a representative genomic organization of a mammalian MPV see Figure 27. In certain embodiments, the genomic organization of a mammalian MPV is different from the genomic organization of pneumoviruses within the sub-family Pneumovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae. The classification of the two genera, metapneumovirus and pneumovirus, is based primarily on their gene constellation; metapneumoviruses generally lack non-structural proteins such as NSl or NS2 {see also Randhawa et al, 1997, J. Virol. 71:9849-9854) and the gene order is different from that of pneumoviruses (RSV: '3-NS1-NS2-N-P-MTSH-G-F-M2-L-5', APV: '3-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5') (Lung, et al, 1992, J. Gen. Virol. 73:1709-17 15; Yu, et al., 1992, Virology 186:426-434; Randhawa, et al., 1997, J. Virol. 71:9849-9854).<br>
Further, a mammalian MPV of the invention can be identified by its immunological<br>
properties. In certain embodiments, specific anti-sera can be raised against mammalian MPV<br>
that can neutralize mammalian MPV. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be raised<br>
against MPV that can also neutralize mammalian MPV. {See, PCX WO 02/057302 at pages<br>
	to	, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The mammalian MPV of the invention is further characterized by its ability to infect a mammalian host, i.e., a mammalian cultured cell or a mammal. Unlike APV, mammalian MPV does not replicate or replicates only at low levels in chickens and turkeys. Mammalian MPV replicates, however, in mammalian hosts, such as cynomolgous macaques. In certain,<br><br>
more specific, embodiments, a mammalian MPV is further characterized by its ability to replicate in a mammahan host. In certain, more specific embodiments, a mammalian MPV is further characterized by its ability to cause the mammalian host to express proteins encoded by the genome of the mammalian MPV. In even more specific embodiments, the viral proteins expressed by the mammalian MPV are inserted into the cytoplasmic membranes of the mammalian host. In certain embodiments, the mammahan MPV of the invention can infect a mammalian host and cause the mammalian host to produce new infectious viral particles of the mammalian MPV. For a more detailed description of the functional characteristics of the mammalian MPV of the invention, see section 5.1.2.<br>
In certain embodiments, the appearance of a virus in an electron microscope or its sensitivity to chloroform can be used to identify the virus as a mammalian MPV. The mammalian MPV of the invention appears in an electron microscope as paramyxovirus-like particle. Consistently, a mammalian MPV is sensitive to treatment with chloroform; a mammalian MPV is cultured optimally on tMK cells or cells functionally equivalent thereto and it is essentially trypsine dependent in most cell cultures. Furthermore, a mammalian MPV has a typical cytopathic effects (CPE) and lacks haemagglutinating activity against species of red blood cells. The CPE induced by MPV isolates are similar to the CPE induced by hRSV, with characteristic syncytia formation followed by rapid internal disruption of the cells and subsequent detachment from the culture plates.   Although most paramyxoviruses have haemagglutinating activity, most of the pneumoviruses do not (Pringle, C.R. In: The Paramyxoviruses; (ed. D.W. Kingsbury) 1-39 (Plenum Press, New York, 1991)). A mammalian MPV contains a second overlapping ORF (M2-2) in the nucleic acid fragment encoding the M2 protein. The occurrence of this second overlapping ORF occurs in other pneumoviruses as shown in Ahmadian et ai, 1999, J. Gen. Vir. 80:2011-2016.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods to identify a viral isolate as a mammalian MPV. A test sample can, e.g., be obtained from an animal or human. The sample is then tested for the presence of a virus of the sub-family Pneumovirinae. If a virus of the sub-family Pneumovinnae is present, the virus can be tested for any of the characteristics of a mammahan MPV as discussed herein, such as, but not limited to, phylogenetic relatedness to a mammalian MPV, nucleotide sequence identity to a nucleotide sequence of a mammalian MPV, amino acid sequence identity/homology to a amino acid<br><br>
sequence of a mammalian MPV, and genomic organization. Furthermore, the virus can be identified as a mammalian MPV by cross-hybridization experiments using nucleic acid sequences from a MPV isolate, RT-PCR using primers specific to mammalian MPV, or in classical cross-serology experiments using antibodies directed against a mammalian MPV isolate. In certain other embodiments, a mammalian MPV can be identified on the basis of its immunological distinctiveness, as determined by quantitative neutralization with animal antisera. The antisera can be obtained from, e.g., ferrets, pigs or macaques that are infected with a mammalian MPV (see, e.g.. Example 8).<br>
In certain embodiments, the serotype does not cross-react with viruses other than mammalian MPV. In other embodiments, the serotype shows a homologous-to-heterologous titer ratio &gt;16 in both directions If neutralization shows a certain degree of cross-reaction between two viruses in either or both directions (homologous-to-heterologous titer ration of eight or sixteen), distinctiveness of serotype is assumed if substantial biophysical/biochemical differences of DNA sequences exist. If neutralization shows a distinct degree of cross-reaction between two viruses in either or both directions (homologous-to-heterologous titer ratio of smaller than eight), identity of serotype of the isolates under study is assumed.

In certain embodiments, a virus can be identified as a mammalian MPV by means of sequence homology/identity of the viral proteins or nucleic acids in comparison with the amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequences of the viral isolates disclosed herein by sequence or deposit. In particular, a virus is identified as a mammalian MPV when the genome of the virus contains a nucleic acid sequence that has a percentage nucleic acid identity to a virus isolate deposited as 1-2614 with CNCM, Paris which is higher than the percentages identified herein for the nucleic acids encoding the L protein, the M protein, the N protein, the P protein, or the F protein as identified herein below in comparison with APV-C {seeTahle 1). {See, PCT WO 02/05302, at pp. 12 to 19, which is incorporated by reference herein. Without being bound by theory, it is generally known that viral species, especially RNA virus species, often constitute a quasi species wherein the members of a cluster of the viruses display sequence heterogeneity. Thus, it is expected that each individual isolate may have a somewhat different percentage of sequence identity when compared to APV-C.<br><br>
The highest amino sequence identity between the proteins of MPV and any of the known other viruses of the same family to date is the identity between APV-C and human MPV. Between human MPV and APV-C, the amino acid sequence identity for the matrix protein is 87%, 88% for the nucleoprotein, 68% for the phosphoprotein, 81% for the fusion protein and 56-64% for parts of the polymerase protein, as can be deduced when comparing the sequences given in Figure 30, see also Table 1. Viral isolates that contain ORFs that encode proteins with higher homology compared to these maximum values are considered mammalian MPVs. It should be noted that, similar to other viruses, a certain degree of variation is found between different isolated of mammalian MPVs.<br><br>

The invention provides two subgroups of mammahan MPV, subgroup A and subgroup B. The invention also provides four variants Al, A2, Bl and B2. A mammalian MPV can be identified as a member of subgroup A if it is phylogenetically closer related to the isolate 00-1 (SEQ ID NO: 19) than to the isolate 99-1 (SEQ ID NO: 18). A mammalian MPV can be identified as a member of subgroup B if it is phylogenetically closer related to the isolate 99-1 (SEQ ID N0:18) than to the isolate 00-1 (SEQ ID N0:19). In other embodiments, nucleotide or amino acid sequence homologies of individual ORFs can be used to classify a mammalian MPV as belonging to subgroup A or B.<br>
The different isolates of mammalian MPV can be divided into four different variants, variant Al, variant A2, variant Bl and variant B2 (^eeFigures 21 and 22). The isolate 00-1 (SEQ ID N0:19) is an example of the variant Al of mammalian MPV. The isolate 99-1 (SEQ ID N0:18) is an example of the variant Bl of mammalian MPV. A mammalian MPV<br><br>
can be grouped into one of the four variants using a phylogenetic analysis. Thus, a mammalian MPV belongs to a specific variant if it is phylogenetically closer related to a known member of that variant than it is phylogenetically related to a member of another variant of mammalian MPV. The sequence of any ORF and the encoded polypeptide may be used to type a MPV isolate as belonging to a particular subgroup or variant, including N, P, L, M, SH, G, M2 or F polypeptides. In a specific embodiment, the classification of a mammalian MPV into a variant is based on the sequence of the G protein. Without being bound by theory, the G protein sequence is well suited for phylogenetic analysis because of the high degree of variation among G proteins of the different variants of mammalian MPV.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, sequence homology may be determined by the ability of two sequences to hybridize under certain conditions, as set forth below. A nucleic acid which is hybridizable to a nucleic acid of a mammalian MPV, or to its reverse complement, or to its complement can be used in the methods of the invention to determine their sequence homology and identities to each other. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acids are hybridized under conditions of high stringency.<br>
It is well-known to the skilled artisan that hybridization conditions, such as, but not limited to, temperature, salt concentration, pH, formamide concentration (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, Chapters 9 to 11, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In certain embodiments, hybridization is performed in aqueous solution and the ionic strength of the solution is kept constant while the hybridization temperature is varied dependent on the degree of sequence homology between the sequences that are to be hybridized. For DNA sequences that 100% identical to each other and are longer than 200 basebairs, hybridization is carried out at approximately 15-25°C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the perfect hybrid. The melting temperature (Tm) can be calculated using the following equation (Bolton and McCarthy, 1962, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:1390):<br>
Tm = 81.5°C - 16.6(loglO[Na+]) + (%G+C) - 0.63(%formamide) - (600/1)<br><br>
Wherein (Tm) is the melting temperature, [Na+] is the sodium concentration, G+C is the Guanine and Cytosine content, and 1 is the length of the hybrid in basepairs. The effect of mismatches between the sequences can be calculated using the formula by Bonner et al. (Bonner et al., 1973, J. Mol. Biol. 81:123-135): for every 1% of mismatching of bases in the hybrid, the melting temperature is reduced by 1-1.5°C.<br>
Thus, by determining the temperature at which two sequences hybridize, one of skill in the art can estimate how similar a sequence is to a known sequence. This can be done, e.g., by comparison of the empirically determined hybridization temperature with the hybridization temperature calculated for the know sequence to hybridize with its perfect match. Through the use of the formula by Bonner et al., the relationship between hybridization temperature and per cent mismatch can be exploited to provide information about sequence similarity.<br>
By way of example and not limitation, procedures using such conditions of high stringency are as follows. Prehybridization of filters containing DNA is carried out for 8 h to overnight at 65 C in buffer composed of 6X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 ng/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters are hybridized for 48 h at 65 C in prehybridization mixture containing 100 jig/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5-20 X 106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Washing of fihers is done at 37 C for 1 h in a solution containing 2X SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in O.IX SSC at 50 C for 45 min before autoradiography. Other conditions of high stringency which may be used are well known in the art. In other embodiments of the invention, hybridization is performed under moderate of low stringency conditions, such conditions are well-known to the skilled artisan {see e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; see also, Ausubel et al., eds., in the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology series of laboratory technique manuals, 1987-1997 Current Protocols,© 1994-1997 John Wiley and Sons, Inc., each of which is incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). An illustrative low stringency condition is provided by the following system of buffers: hybridization in a buffer comprising 35% formamide, 5X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 ^g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate for 18-20 hours at 40°C, washing in a buffer consisting of 2X SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and<br><br>
0.1% SDS for 1.5 hours at 55°C, and washing in a buffer consisting of 2X SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS for 1.5 hours at 60°C.<br>
In certain embodiments, a mammalian MPV can be classified into one of the variant using probes that are specific for a specific variant of mammalian MPV. Such probes include primers for RT-PCR and antibodies. Illustrative methods for identifying a mammalian MPV as a member of a specific variant are described in section 5.9 below.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the different variants of mammahan MPV can be distinguished from each other by way of the amino acid sequences of the different viral proteins (see, e.g.. Figure 42b). In other embodiments, the different variants of mammalian MPV can be distinguished from each other by way of the nucleotide sequences of the different ORFs encoded by the viral genome (see, e.g., Figure 42b). A variant of mammalian MPV can be, but is not limited to, Al, A2, Bl or B2. The invention, however, also contemplates isolates of mammalian MPV that are members of another variant yet to be identified. The invention also contemplates that a virus may have one or more ORF that are closer related to one variant and one or more ORFs that are closer phylogenetically related to another variant. Such a virus would be classified into the variant to which the majority of its ORFs are closer phylogenetically related. Non-coding sequences may also be used to determine phylogenetic relatedness.<br>

In addition to the structural definitions of the mammalian MPV, a mammalian MPV can also be defined by its functional characteristics. In certain embodiments, the mammalian MPV of the invention is capable of infecting a mammalian host. The mammalian host can be a mammalian cell, tissue, organ or a mammal. In a specific embodiment, the mammalian host is a human or a human cell, tissue or organ.

For example, after infection of the cell with the virus, the cells are maintained in medium comprising a detectably labeled amino acid. The cells are subsequently harvested, lysed, and the cytoplasmic fraction is separated from the membrane fraction. The proteins of the membrane fraction are then solubilized and then subjected to an immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to a protein of the mammalian MPV, such as, but not limited to, the F protein or the G protein.

5.3       RECOMBINANT AND CHIMERIC METAPNEUMOVIRUS<br><br>
The present invention encompasses recombinant or chimeric viruses encoded by viral vectors derived from the genomes of metapneumovirus, including both mammalian and avian variants. In accordance with the present invention a recombinant virus is one derived from a mammalian MPV or an APV that is encoded by endogenous or native genomic sequences or non-native genomic sequences. In accordance with the invention, a non-native sequence is one tnat is different from the native or endogenous genomic sequence due to one or more mutations, including, but not limited to, point mutations, rearrangements, insertions, deletions etc., to the genomic sequence that may or may not result in a phenotypic change. The recombinant viruses of the invention encompass those viruses encoded by viral vectors derived from the genomes of metapneumovirus, including both mammalian and avian variants, and may or may not, include nucleic acids that are non-native to the viral genome. In accordance with the present invention, a viral vector which is derived from the genome of a metapneumovirus is one that contains a nucleic acid sequence that encodes at least a part of one ORP of a mammalian metapneumovirus, wherein the polypeptides encoded by the ORF have amino acid sequence identity as set forth in Section 5.1. supra, and Table 1.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the recombinant viruses of the invention encompass those viruses encoded by viral vectors derived from the genome of a mammalian metapneumovirus (MPV), in particular a human metapneumovirus. In particular embodiments of the invention, the viral vector is derived from the genome of a metapneumovirus Al, A2, Bl or B2 variant. In accordance with the present invention, these viral vectors may or may not include nucleic acids that are non-native to the viral genome<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the recombinant viruses of the invention encompass those viruses encoded by viral vectors derived from the genome of an avian pneumovirus (APV), also known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV). In particular embodiments of the invention, the viral vector is derived from the genome of an APV subgroup A, B, C or D.

In accordance with the present invention these viral vectors may or may not include nucleic acids that are non-native to the viral genome.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the recombinant viruses of the invention encompass those viruses encoded by a viral vector derived from the genome of an APV that contains a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a F-ORF of APV subgroup C. In<br><br>
certain embodiments, a viral vector derived from the genome of an APV is one that contains a nucleic acid sequence that encodes at least a N-ORF, a P-ORF, a M-ORF, a F-ORF, a M2-1-0RF, a M2-2-ORF or a L-ORF of APV.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a chimeric virus is a recombinant MPV or APV which further comprises a heterologous nucleotide sequence. In accordance with the invention, a chimeric virus may be encoded by a nucleotide sequence in which heterologous nucleotide sequences have been added to the genome or in which endogenous or native nucleotide sequences have been replaced with heterologous nucleotide sequences.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the chimeric viruses are encoded by the viral vectors of the invention which further comprise a heterologous nucleotide sequence. In accordance with the present invention a chimeric virus is encoded by a viral vector that may or may not include nucleic acids that are non-native to the viral genome. In accordance with the invention a chimeric virus is encoded by a viral vector to which heterologous nucleotide sequences have been added, inserted or substituted for native or non-native sequences. In accordance with the present invention, the chimeric virus may be encoded by nucleotide sequences derived from different strains of mammalian MPV. In particular, the chimeric virus is encoded by nucleotide sequences that encode antigenic polypeptides derived from different strains of MPV.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the chimeric virus may be encoded by a viral vector derived from the genome of an APV, in particular subgroup C, that additionally encodes a heterologous sequence that encodes antigenic polypeptides derived from one or more strains of MPV.<br>
A chimeric virus may be of particular use for the generation of recombinant vaccines protecting against two or more viruses (Tao et al., J. Virol. 72, 2955-2961; Durbin et al., 2000, J.Virol. 74, 6821-6831; Skiadopoulos et al., 1998, J. Virol. 72, 1762-1768; Teng et al., 2000, J.Virol. 74,9317-9321). For example, it can be envisaged that a MPV or APV virus vector expressing one or more proteins of another negative strand RNA virus, e.g., RSV or a RSV vector expressing one or more proteins of MPV will protect individuals vaccinated with such vector against both virus infections. A similar approach can be envisaged for PIV or other paramyxoviruses. Attenuated and replication-defective viruses may be of use for<br><br>
vaccination purposes with live vaccines as has been suggested for other viruses. (See, PCT WO 02/057302, at pp. 6 and 23, incorporated by reference herein).<br>
In accordance with the present invention the heterologous sequence to be incorporated into the viral vectors encoding the recombinant or chimeric viruses of the invention include sequences obtained or derived from different strains of metapneumovirus, strains of avian pneumovirus, and other negative strand RNA viruses, including, but not limited to, RSV, PIV and influenza virus, and other viruses, including morbillivirus.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the chimeric or recombinant viruses of the invention are encoded by viral vectors derived from viral genomes wherein one or more sequences, intergenic regions, termini sequences, or portions or entire ORF have been substituted with a heterologous or non-native sequence. In certain embodiments of the invention, the chimeric viruses of the invention are encoded by viral vectors derived from viral genomes wherein one or more heterologous sequences have been added to the vector.<br>
In certain embodiments, the virus of the invention contains heterologous nucleic acids. In a preferred embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is inserted or added at Position 1 of the viral genome. In another preferred embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is inserted or added at Position 2 of the viral genome. In even another preferred embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is inserted or added at Position 3 of the viral genome. Insertion or addition of nucleic acid sequences at the lower-numbered positions of the viral genome results in stronger or higher levels of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence compared to insertion at higher-numbered positions due to a transcriptional gradient across the genome of the virus. Thus, inserting or adding heterologous nucleotide sequences at lower-numbered positions is the preferred embodiment of the invention if high levels of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence is desired.<br>
Without being bound by theory, the position of insertion or addition of the heterologous sequence affects the replication rate of the recombinant or chimeric virus. The higher rates of replication can be achieved if the heterologous sequence is inserted or added at Position 2 or Position 1 of the viral genome. The rate of replication is reduced if the heterologous sequence is inserted or added at Position 3, Position 4, Position 5, or Position 6.<br><br>
Without being bound by theory, the size of the intergenic region between the viral gene and the heterologous sequence further determines rate of replication of the virus and expression levels of the heterologous sequence.<br>
In certain embodiments, the viral vector of the invention contains two or more different heterologous nucleotide sequences. In a preferred embodiment, one heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 1 and a second heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 2 of the viral genome. In another preferred embodiment, one heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 1 and a second heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 3 of the viral genome. In even another preferred embodiment, one heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 2 and a second heterologous nucleotide sequence is at Position 3 of the viral genome. In certain other embodiments, a heterologous nucleotide sequence is inserted at other, higher-numbered positions of the viral genome. In accordance with the present invention, the position of the heterologous sequence refers to the order in which the sequences are transcribed from the viral genome, e.g., a heterologous sequence at Position 1 is the first gene sequence to be transcribed from the genome.<br>
The selection of the viral vector may depend on the species of the subject that is to be treated or protected from a viral infection. If the subject is human, then an attenuated mammalian metapneumovirus or an avian pneumovirus can be used to provide the antigenic sequences.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the viral vectors can be engineered to provide antigenic sequences which confer protection against infection by a metapneumovirus, including sequences derived from mammalian metapneumovirus, human metapneumovirus, MPV variants Al, A2, Bl or B2, sequences derived from avian pneumovirus, including APV subgroups A, B, C or D, although C is preferred. The viral vectors can be engineered to provide antigenic sequences which confer protection against infection or disease by another virus, including negative strand RNA virus, including influenza, RSV or PIV, including PIV3. The viral vectors may be engineered to provide one, two, three or more antigenic sequences. In accordance with the present invention the antigenic sequences may be derived from the same virus, from different strains or variants of the same type of virus, or from different viruses, including morbillivirus.<br><br>

In certain specific embodiments of the invention, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is derived from a human metapneumovirus. In another specific embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is derived from an avian pneumovirus.

In certain specific embodiments, the nucleotide sequence encodes a protein of any one of SEQ ID N0:6 through SEQ ED N0:13, SEQ ID NO:16, and SEQ ID N0:17.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the invention, the heterologous nucleotide sequence encodes a chimeric F protein. In an illustrative embodiment, the ectodomain of the chimeric F-protein is the ectodomain of a human MPV and the transmembrane domain and the luminal domain are derived from the F-protein of an avian metapneumovirus. Without being bound by theory, a chimeric human MPV that encodes the chimeric F-protein consisting of the human ectodomain and the avian luminol/transmembrane domain is attenuated because of the avian part of the F-protein, yet highly immunogenic against hMPV because of the human ectodomain.<br>
In certain embodiments, two different heterologous nucleotide sequences are inserted or added to the viral vectors of the invention, derived from metapneumoviral genomes, including mammalian and avian. For example, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is derived from a human metapneumovirus, an avian pneumovirus, RSV, PIV, or influenza.

In another specific embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a metapneumovirus is inserted at a higher-numbered position than the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a respiratory syncytial virus.<br>
In certain embodiments, the virus of the invention contains two different heterologous nucleotide sequences wherein a first heterologous nucleotide sequence is derived from a metapneumovirus, such as a human metapneumovirus or an avian pneumovirus, and a second nucleotide sequence is derived from a parainfluenza virus, such as, but not limited to PIV3 (seeTable 2). In specific embodiments, the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from PIV is a F gene of PIV. In other specific embodiments, the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from PIV is a G gene of a PIV. In a specific embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a metapneumovirus is inserted at a lower-numbered position than the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a PIV. In another specific embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a metapneumovirus is inserted at a higher-numbered position than the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a PIV.<br>
The expression products and/or recombinant or chimeric virions obtained in accordance with the invention may advantageously be utilized in vaccine formulations. The expression products and chimeric virions of the present invention may be engineered to create vaccines against a broad range of pathogens, including viral and bacterial antigens, tumor antigens, allergen antigens, and auto antigens involved in autoimmime disorders. In particular, the chimeric virions of the present invention may be engineered to create vaccines for the protection of a subject from infections with PIV, RSV, and/or metapneumovirus.<br><br>

In certain embodiments, the invention relates to trivalent vaccines comprising a recombinant or chimeric virus of the invention. In specific embodiments, the virus used as backbone for a trivalent vaccine is a chimeric avian-human metapneumovirus or a chimeric human-avian metapneumovirus containing a first heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a RSV and a second heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from PIV. In an exemplary embodiment, such a trivalent vaccine will be specific to (a) the gene products of the F gene and/or the G gene of the human metapneumovirus or avian pneumovirus, respectively, dependent on whether chimeric avian-human or chimeric human-avian metapneumovirus is used; (b) the protein encoded by the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from a RSV; and (c) the protein encoded by the heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from PIV. In a specific embodiment, the first heterologous nucleotide sequence is the F gene of the respiratory syncytial virus and is inserted in Position 1, and the second heterologous nucleotide sequence is the F gene of the PIV and is inserted in Position 3. Many more combinations are encompassed by the present invention and some are shown by way of example in Table 2. Further, nucleotide sequences encoding chimeric F proteins could be used (seesupra). In some less preferred embodiments, the heterologous nucleotide sequence can be inserted at higher-numbered positions of the viral genome.<br><br><br>
In certain embodiments, the expression products and recombinant or chimeric virions of the present invention may be engineered to create vaccines against a broad range of pathogens, including viral antigens, tumor antigens and auto antigens involved in autoimmune disorders. One way to achieve this goal involves modifying existing metapneumoviral genes to contain foreign sequences in their respective external domains. Where the heterologous sequences are epitopes or antigens of pathogens, these chimeric viruses may be used to induce a protective immune response against the disease agent from which these determinants are derived.<br>

response or by stimulating tolerance to an antigen. As used herein, a subject means: humans, primates, horses, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, dogs, cats, avian species and rodents.<br>
The invention may be divided into the following stages solely for the purpose of description and not by way of limitation: (a) construction of recombinant cDNA and RNA templates; (b) expression of heterologous gene products using recombinant cDNA and RNA templates; (c) rescue of the heterologous gene in recombinant virus particles; and (d) generation and use of vaccines comprising the recombinant virus particles of the invention.<br>
5.4       CONSTRUCTION OF THE RECOMBINANT cDNA AND RNA<br>
Li certain embodiments, the viral vectors are derived from the genomes of human or mammalian metapneumovirus of the invention. In other embodiments, the viral vectors are derived from the genome of avian pneumovirus. fri certain embodiments, viral vectors contain sequences derived from mammalian MPV and APV, such that a chimeric human MPV/APV virus is encoded by the viral vector, fri an exemplary embodiment, the F-gene and/or the G-gene of human metapneumovirus have been replaced with the F-gene and/or the G-gene of avian pneumovirus to construct chimeric hMPV/APV virus, hi other embodiments, viral vectors contain sequences derived from APV and mammalian MPV, such that a chimeric APV/hMPV virus is encoded by the viral vector. In more exemplary embodiments, the F-gene and/or the G-gene of avian pneumovirus have been replaced with the F-gene and/or the G-gene of human metapneumovirus to construct the chimeric APV/hMPV virus.<br>
The present invention also encompasses recombinant viruses comprising a viral vector derived from a mammalian MPV or APV genome containing sequences endogenous or native to the viral genome, and may or may not contain sequences non-native to the viral genome. Non-native sequences include those that are different from native or endogenous sequences which may or may not result in a phenotypic change. The recombinant viruses of the invention may contain sequences which result in a virus having a phenotype more suitable for use in vaccine formulations, e.g., attenuated phenotype or enhanced antigenicity. The mutations and modifications can be in coding regions, in intergenic regions and in the leader and trailer sequences of the virus.<br><br>
In certain embodiments the viral vectors of the invention comprise nucleotide sequences derived from hMPV, APV, hMPV/APV or APV/hMPV, in which native nucleotide sequences have been substituted with heterologous sequences or in which heterologous sequences have been added to the native raetapneumoviral sequences.<br>
In a more specific embodiment, a chimeric virus comprises a viral vector derived from MPV, APV, APV/hMPV, or hMPV/APV in which heterologous sequences derived from PIV have been added. In a more specific embodiment, a recombinant virus comprises a viral vector derived from MPV, APV, APV/hMPV, or hMPV/APV in which sequences have been replaced by heterologous sequences derived from PIV. In other specific embodiments, a chimeric virus comprises a viral vector derived from MPV, APV, APV/hMPV, or hMPV/APV in which heterologous sequences derived from RSV have been added. In a more specific embodiment, a chimeric virus comprises a viral vector derived from MPV, APV, APV/hMPV, or hMPV/APV in which sequences have been replaced by heterologous sequences derived from RSV.<br>
Heterologous gene coding sequences flanked by the complement of the viral polymerase binding site/promoter, e.g., the complement of 3'-hMPV virus terminus of the present invention, or the complements of both the 3'- and 5'-hMPV virus termini may be constructed using techniques known in the art. In more specific embodiments, a recombinant virus of the invention contains the leader and trailer sequence of hMPV or APV. In certain embodiments, the intergenic regions are obtained from hMPV or APV. The resulting RNA templates may be of the negative-polarity and contain appropriate terminal sequences which enable the viral RNA-synthesizing apparatus to recognize the template. Alternatively, positive-polarity RNA templates which contain appropriate terminal sequences which enable the viral RNA-synthesizing apparatus to recognize the template, may also be used. Recombinant DNA molecules containing these hybrid sequences can be cloned and transcribed by a DNA-directed RNA polymerase, such as bacteriophage T7, T3, the SP6 polymerase or eukaryotic polymerase such as polymerase I and the like, to produce in vitro or in vivo the recombinant RNA templates which possess the appropriate viral sequences that allow for viral polymerase recognition and activity. In a more specific embodiment, the RNA polymerase is fowlpox virus T7 RNA polymerase or a MVA T7 RNA polymerase.<br><br>
An illustrative approach for constructing these hybrid molecules is to insert the heterologous nucleotide sequence into a DNA complement of a hMPV, APV, APV/hMPV or hMPV/APV genome, so that the heterologous sequence is flanked by the viral sequences required for viral polymerase activity; i.e., the viral polymerase binding site/promoter, hereinafter referred to as the viral polymerase binding site, and a polyadenylation site, hi a preferred embodiment, the heterologous coding sequence is flanked by the viral sequences that comprise the replication promoters of the 5' and 3' termini, the gene start and gene end sequences, and the packaging signals that are found in the 5' and/or the 3' termini. In an alternative approach, oligonucleotides encoding the viral polymerase binding site, e.g., the complement of the 3'-terminus or both termini of the virus genomic segment can be ligated to the heterologous coding sequence to construct the hybrid molecule. The placement of a foreign gene or segment of a foreign gene within a target sequence was formerly dictated by the presence of appropriate restriction enzyme sites within the target sequence. However, recent advances in molecular biology have lessened this problem greatly. Restriction enzyme sites can readily be placed anywhere within a target sequence through the use of site-directed mutagenesis {e.g., see, for example, the techniques described by Kunkel, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82;488). Variations in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, described infra, also allow for the specific insertion of sequences {i.e., restriction enzyme sites) and allow for the facile construction of hybrid molecules. Alternatively, PCR reactions could be used to prepare recombinant templates without the need of cloning. For example, PCR reactions could be used to prepare double-stranded DNA molecules containing a DNA-directed RNA polymerase promoter {e.g., bacteriophage T3, T7 or SP6) and the hybrid sequence containing the heterologous gene and the PIV polymerase binding site. RNA templates could then be transcribed directly from this recombinant DNA. In yet another embodiment, the recombinant RNA templates may be prepared by ligating RNAs specifying the negative polarity of the heterologous gene and the viral polymerase binding site using an RNA ligase.<br>
In addition, one or more nucleotides can be added in the untranslated region to adhere to the "Rule of Six" which may be important in obtaining virus rescue. The "Rule of Six" applies to many paramyxoviruses and states that the RNA nucleotide genome must be divisible by six to be ftinctional. The addition of nucleotides can be accomplished by<br><br>
techniques known in the art such as using a commercial mutagenesis kits such as the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After addition of the appropriate number of nucleotides, the correct DNA fragment can then be isolated by digestion with appropriate restriction enzyme and gel purification. Sequence requirements for viral polymerase activity and constructs which may be used in accordance with the invention are described in the subsections below.<br>
Without being bound by theory, several parameters affect the rate of replication of the recombinant virus and the level of expression of the heterologous sequence. In particular, the position of the heterologous sequence in hMPV, APV, hMPV/APV or APV/hMPV and the length of the intergenic region that flanks the heterologous sequence determine rate of replication and expression level of the heterologous sequence.<br>
In certain embodiments, the leader and or trailer sequence of the virus are modified relative to the wild type virus. In certain more specific embodiments, the lengths of the leader and/or trailer are altered. In other embodiments, the sequence(s) of the leader and/or trailer are mutated relative to the wild type virus. For more detail, see section 5.7.<br>
The production of a recombinant virus of the invention relies on the replication of a partial or full-length copy of the negative sense viral RNA (vRNA) genome or a complementary copy thereof (cRNA). This vRNA or cRNA can be isolated from infectious virus, produced upon in-vitro transcription, or produced in cells upon transfection of nucleic acids. Second, the production of recombinant negative strand virus relies on a functional polymerase complex. Typically, the polymerase complex of pneumoviruses consists of N, P, L and possibly M2 proteins, but is not necessarily limited thereto.<br>
Polymerase complexes or components thereof can be isolated from virus particles, isolated from cells expressing one or more of the components, or produced upon transfection of specific expression vectors.<br>
Infectious copies of MPV can be obtained when the above mentioned vRNA, cRNA, or vectors expressing these RNAs are replicated by the above mentioned polymerase complex 16 (Schnell et al., 1994, EMBO J 13: 4195-4203; Collins, et al., 1995, PNAS 92: 11563-11567; Hoffmann, et al., 2000, PNAS 97: 6108-6113; Bridgen, et al., 1996, PNAS 93: 15400-15404; Palese, et al., 1996, PNAS 93: 11354-11358; Peeters, et al., 1999, J.Virol. 73: 5001-5009; Durbin, et al., 1997, Virology 235: 323-332).<br><br>
The invention provides a host cell comprising a nucleic acid or a vector according to the invention. Plasmid or viral vectors containing the polymerase components of MPV (presumably N, P, L and M2, but not necessarily limited thereto) are generated in prokaryotic cells for the expression of the components in relevant cell types (bacteria, insect cells, eukaryotic cells). Plasmid or viral vectors containing full-length or partial copies of the MPV genome will be generated in prokaryotic cells for the expression of viral nucleic acids in-vitro or in-vivo. The latter vectors may contain other viral sequences for the generation of chimeric viruses or chimeric virus proteins, may lack parts of the viral genome for the generation of replication defective virus, and may contain mutations, deletions or insertions for the generation of attenuated viruses.<br>
Infectious copies of MPV (being wild type, attenuated, replication-defective or chimeric) can be produced upon co-expression of the polymerase components according to the state-of-the-art technologies described above.<br>
In addition, eukaryotic cells, transiently or stably expressing one or more full-length or partial MPV proteins can be used. Such cells can be made by transfection (proteins or nucleic acid vectors), infection (viral vectors) or transduction (viral vectors) and may be useftil for complementation of mentioned wild type, attenuated, replication-defective or chimeric viruses.<br>

5.4.2    INSERTION OF THE HETEROLOGOUS GENE SEQUENCE<br>
Insertion of a foreign gene sequence into a viral vector of the invention can be accomplished by either a complete replacement of a viral coding region with a heterologous sequence or by a partial replacement or by adding the heterologous nucleotide sequence to the viral genome. Complete replacement would probably best be accomplished through the use of PCR-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, PCR-primer A would contain, from the 5' to 3'end: a unique restriction enzyme site, such as a class US restriction enzyme site {i.e., a "shifter" enzyme; that recognizes a specific sequence but cleaves the DNA either upstream or dovrastream of that sequence); a stretch of nucleotides complementary to a region of the gene that is to be replaced; and a stretch of nucleotides complementary to the carboxy-terminus coding portion of the heterologous sequence. PCR-primer B would contain from the 5' to 3' end: a unique restriction enzyme site; a stretch of nucleotides complementary to the gene that is to be replaced; and a stretch of nucleotides corresponding to the 5' coding portion of the heterologous or non-native gene. After a PCR reaction using these primers with a cloned copy of the heterologous or non-native gene, the product may be excised and cloned using the unique restriction sites. Digestion with the class IIS enzyme and transcription with the purified phage polymerase would generate a RNA molecule containing the exact untranslated ends of the viral gene that carries now a heterologous or non-native gene insertion. In an ahemate embodiment, PCR-primed reactions could be used to prepare double-stranded DNA<br><br>
containing the bacteriophage promoter sequence, and the hybrid gene sequence so that RNA templates can be transcribed directly without cloning.<br>
A heterologous nucleotide sequence can be added or inserted at various positions of the virus of the invention. ]n one embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 1. In another embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 2. In another embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 3. In another embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 4. In another embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 5. In yet another embodiment, the heterologous nucleotide sequence is added or inserted at position 6. As used herein, the term "position" refers to the position of the heterologous nucleotide sequence on the viral genome to be transcribed, e.g., position 1 means that it is the first gene to be transcribed, and position 2 means that it is the second gene to be transcribed. Inserting heterologous nucleotide sequences at the lower-numbered positions of the virus generally results in stronger expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence compared to insertion at higher-numbered positions due to a transcriptional gradient that occurs across the genome of the virus. However, the transcriptional gradient also yields specific ratios of viral mRNAs. Insertion of foreign genes will perturb these ratios and result in the synthesis of different amounts of viral proteins that may influence virus replication. Thus, both the transcriptional gradient and the replication kinetics must be considered when choosing an insertion site. Inserting heterologous nucleotide sequences at lower-numbered positions is the preferred embodiment of the invention if strong expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence is desired. In a preferred embodiment, the heterologous sequence is added or inserted at position 1, 2 or 3.<br>
When inserting a heterologous nucleotide sequence into the virus of the invention, the intergenic region between the end of the coding sequence of the heterologous gene and the start of the coding sequence of the downstream gene can be altered to achieve a desired effect. As used herein, the term "intergenic region" refers to nucleotide sequence between the stop signal of one gene and the start codon (e.g., AUG) of the coding sequence of the next downstream open reading fi-ame. An intergenic region may comprise a non-coding region of a gene, i.e., between the transcription start site and the start of the coding sequence (AUG) of the gene. This non-coding region occurs naturally in some viral genes.<br><br>
In various embodiments, the intergenic region between the heterologous nucleotide sequence and the downstream gene can be engineered, independently from each other, to be at least 10 nt in length, at least 20 nt in length, at least 30 nt in length, at least 50 nt in length, at least 75 nt in length, at least 100 nt in length, at least 125 nt in length, at least 150 nt in length, at least 175 nt in length or at least 200 nt in length. In cenain embodiments, the intergenic region between the heterologous nucleotide sequence and the downstream gene can be engineered, independently from each other, to be at most 10 nt in length, at most 20 nt in length, at most 30 nt in length, at most 50 nt in length, at most 75 nt in length, at most 100 nt in length, at most 125 nt in length, at most 150 nt in length, at most 175 nt in length or at most 200 nt in length. In various embodiments, the non-coding region of a desired gene in a virus genome can also be engineered, independently from each other, to be at least 10 nt in length, at least 20 nt in length, at least 30 nt in length, at least 50 nt in length, at least 75 nt in length, at least 100 nt in length, at least 125 nt in length, at least 150 nt in length, at least 175 nt in length or at least 200 nt in length. In certain embodiments, the non-coding region of a desired gene in a virus genome can also be engineered, independently from each other, to be at most 10 nt in length, at most 20 nt in length, at most 30 nt in length, at most 50 nt in length, at most 75 nt in length, at most 100 nt in length, at most 125 nt in length, at most 150 nt in length, at most 175 nt in length or at most 200 nt in length.<br>
When inserting a heterologous nucleotide sequence, the positional effect and the intergenic region manipulation can be used in combination to achieve a desirable effect. For example, the heterologous nucleotide sequence can be added or inserted at a position selected from the group consisting of position 1,2, 3,4, 5, and 6, and the intergenic region between the heterologous nucleotide sequence and the next downstream gene can be altered {see Table 3). Some of the combinations encompassed by the present invention are shown by way of example in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Depending on the purpose (e.g., to have strong immunogenicity) of the inserted heterologous nucleotide sequence, the position of the insertion and the length of the intergenic region of the inserted heterologous nucleotide sequence can be determined by various indexes including, but not limited to, replication kinetics and protein or mRNA expression levels, measured by following non-limiting examples of assays: plaque assay, fluorescent-focus assay, infectious center assay, transformation assay, endpoint dilution assay, efficiency of plating, electron microscopy, hemagglutination, measurement of viral enzyme activity, viral neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, immunostaining, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, nucleic acid detection (e.g., Southern blot analysis, Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis), growth curve, employment of a reporter gene (e.g., using a reporter gene, such as Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) or enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (eGFP), integrated to the viral genome the same fashion as the interested heterologous gene to observe the protein expression), or a combination thereof Procedures of performing these assays are well known in the art (see, e.g., Flint et al., PRINCIPLES OF VIROLOGY, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, PATHOGENESIS, AND CONTROL, 2000, ASM Press pp 25 - 56, the entire text is<br><br>
incorporated herein by reference), and non-limiting examples are given in the Example sections, infra.<br>
For example, expression levels can be determined by infecting cells in culture with a virus of the invention and subsequently measuring the level of protein expression by, e.g.. Western blot analysis or ELISA using antibodies specific to the gene product of the heterologous sequence, or measuring the level of RNA expression by, e.g.. Northern blot analysis using probes specific to the heterologous sequence. Similarly, expression levels of the heterologous sequence can be determined by infecting an animal model and measuring the level of protein expressed from the heterologous sequence of the recombinant virus of the invention in the animal model. The protein level can be measured by obtaining a tissue sample from the infected animal and then subjecting the tissue sample to Westem blot analysis or ELISA, using antibodies specific to the gene product of the heterologous sequence. Further, if an animal model is used, the titer of antibodies produced by the animal against the gene product of the heterologous sequence can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan, including but not limited to, ELISA.<br>
As the heterologous sequences can be homologous to a nucleotide sequence in the genome of the virus, care should be taken that the probes and the antibodies are indeed specific to the heterologous sequence or its gene product.<br>
In certain specific embodiments, expression levels of F-protein of hMPV from chimeric avian-human metapneumovirus can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan. Expression levels of the F-protein can be determined by infecting cells in a culture with the chimeric virus of the invention and measuring the level of protein expression by, e.g., Westem blot analysis or ELISA using antibodies specific to the F-protein and/or the G-protein of hMPV, or measuring the level of RNA expression by, e.g.. Northern blot analysis using probes specific to the F-gene and/or the G-gene of human metapneumovirus. Similarly, expression levels of the heterologous sequence can be determined using an animal model by infecting an animal and measuring the level of F-protein and/or G-protein in the animal model. The protein level can be measured by obtaining a tissue sample from the infected animal and then subjecting the tissue sample to Westem blot analysis or ELISA using antibodies specific to F-protein and/or G-protein of the heterologous sequence. Further, if an animal model is used, the titer of antibodies produced by the animal against F-protein<br><br>
and/or G-protein can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan, including but not limited to, ELISA.<br>
The rate of replication of a recombinant virus of the invention can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan.<br>
In certain embodiments, to facilitate the identification of the optimal position of the heterologous sequence in the viral genome and the optimal length of the intergenic region, the heterologous sequence encodes a reporter gene. Once the optimal parameters are determined, the reporter gene is replaced by a heterologous nucleotide sequence encoding an antigen of choice. Any reporter gene known to the skilled artisan can be used with the methods of the invention. For more detail, see section 5.8.<br>
The rate of replication of the recombinant virus can be determined by any standard technique known to the skilled artisan. The rate of replication is represented by the growth rate of the vims and can be determined by plotting the viral titer over the time post infection. The viral titer can be measured by any technique known to the skilled artisan. In certain embodiments, a suspension containing the virus is incubated with cells that are susceptible to infection by the virus. Cell types that can be used with the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, Vero cells, LLC-MK-2 cells, Hep-2 cells, LF 1043 (HEL) cells, MRC-5 cells, WI-38 cells, tMK cells, 293 T cells, QT 6 cells, QT 35 cells, or chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Subsequent to the incubation of the virus with the cells, the number of infected cells is determined. In certain specific embodiments, the virus comprises a reporter gene. Thus, the number of cells expressing the reporter gene is representative of the number of infected cells. In a specific embodiment, the virus comprises a heterologous nucleotide sequence encoding for eGFP, and the number of cells expressing eGFP, i.e., the number of cells infected with the virus, is determined using FACS.<br>
In certain embodiments, the replication rate of the recombinant virus of the invention is at most 20 % of the replication rate of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions. The same conditions refer to the same initial titer of virus, the same strain of cells, the same incubation temperature, growth medium, number of cells and other test conditions that may affect the replication rate. For example, the replication rate of APV/hMPV with PIV's F gene in position I is at most 20 % of the replication rate of APV.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the replication rate of the recombinant virus of the invention is at most 5 %, at most 10 %, at most 20 %, at most 30 %, at most 40 %, at most 50 %, at most 75 %, at most 80 %, at most 90 % of the replication rate of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions.

In certain embodiments, the expression level of the heterologous sequence in the recombinant virus of the invention is at most 20 % of the expression level of the F-protein of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions. The same conditions refer to the same initial titer of virus, the same strain of cells, the same incubation temperature, growth medium, number of cells and other test conditions that may affect the replication rate. For example, the expression level of the heterologous sequence of the F-protein of PIV3 in position 1 of hMPV is at most 20 % of the expression level of the F-proteinofhMPV.<br>
In certain embodiments, the expression level of the heterologous sequence in the recombinant virus of the invention is at most 5 %, at most 10 %, at most 20 %, at most 30 %, at most 40 %, at most 50 %, at most 75 %, at most 80 %, at most 90 % of the expression level of the F-protein of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions. In certain embodiments, the expression level of the heterologous sequence in the recombinant virus of the invention is at least 5 %, at least 10 %, at least 20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 %, at least 50 %, at least 75 %, at least 80 %, at least 90 % of the expression level of the F-protein of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions. In certain embodiments, the expression level of the heterologous sequence in the recombinant virus of the invention is between 5 % and 20 %, between 10 % and 40 %, between 25 % and 50 %, between 40 % and 75 %, between 50 % and 80 %, or<br><br>
between 75 % and 90 % of the expression level of the F-protein of the wild type virus from which the recombinant virus is derived under the same conditions.<br>
5.4.3	INSERTION OF THE HETEROLOGOUS GENE SEQUENCE<br>
INTO THE G GENE<br>
The G protein is a transmembrane protein of metapneumoviruses. In a specific embodiment, the heterologous sequence is inserted into the region of the G-ORF that encodes for the ectodomain, such that it is expressed on the surface of the viral envelope. In one approach, the heterologous sequence may be inserted within the antigenic site without deleting any viral sequences. In another approach, the heterologous sequences replaces sequences of the G-ORF. Expression products of such constructs may be usefiil in vaccines against the foreign antigen, and may indeed circumvent problems associated with propagation of the recombinant virus in the vaccinated host. An intact G molecule with a substitution only in antigenic sites may allow for G fimction and thus allow for the construction of a viable virus. Therefore, this virus can be grown without the need for additional helper ftmctions. The virus may also be attenuated in other ways to avoid any danger of accidental escape.<br>
Other hybrid constructions may be made to express proteins on the cell surface or enable them to be released from the cell.<br>
5.4.4	CONSTRUCTION OF BICISTRONIC RNA<br>
Bicistronic mRNA could be constructed to permit internal initiation of translation of viral sequences and allow for the expression of foreign protein coding sequences from the regular terminal initiation site. Alternatively, a bicistronic mRNA sequence may be constructed wherein the viral sequence is translated from the regular terminal open reading frame, while the foreign sequence is initiated from an internal site. Certain internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences may be utilized. The IRES sequences which are chosen should be short enough to not interfere with MPV packaging limitations. Thus, it is preferable that the IRES chosen for such a bicistronic approach be no more than 500 nucleotides in length. In a specific embodiment, the IRES is derived from a picomavirus and does not include any additional picomaviral sequences. Specific IRES elements include, but are not limited to the mammalian BiP IRES and the hepatitis C virus IRES.<br><br>
Alternatively, a foreign protein may be expressed from a new internal transcriptional unit in which the transcriptional unit has an initiation site and polyadenylation site. In another embodiment, the foreign gene is inserted into a MPV gene such that the resulting expressed protein is a fusion protein.<br>
5.5	EXPRESSION OF HETEROLOGOUS GENE PRODUCTS USING<br>
RECOMBINANT cDNA AND RNA TEMPLATES<br>
The viral vectors and recombinant templates prepared as described above can be used in a variety of ways to express the heterologous gene products in appropriate host cells or to create chimeric viruses that express the heterologous gene products. In one embodiment, the recombinant cDNA can be used to transfect appropriate host cells and the resulting RNA may direct the expression of the heterologous gene product at high levels. Host cell systems which provide for high levels of expression include continuous ceil lines that supply viral functions such as cell lines superinfected with APV or MPV, respectively, cell lines engineered to complement APV or MPV functions, etc.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the recombinant templates may be used to transfect cell lines that express a viral polymerase protein in order to achieve expression of the heterologous gene product. To this end, transformed cell lines that express a polymerase protein such as the L protein may be utilized as appropriate host cells. Host cells may be similarly engineered to provide other viral functions or additional functions such as G or N.<br>
hi another embodiment, a helper virus may provide the RNA polymerase protein utilized by the cells in order to achieve expression of the heterologous gene product. In yet another embodiment, cells may be transfected with vectors encoding viral proteins such as the N, P, L, and M2-1 proteins.<br>
5.6	RESCUE OF RECOMBINANT VIRUS PARTICLES<br>
In order to prepare the chimeric and recombinant viruses of the invention, a cDNA encoding the genome of a recombinant or chimeric virus of the invention in the plus or minus sense may be used to transfect cells which provide viral proteins and functions required for replication and rescue. Alternatively, cells may be transfected with helper virus before, during, or after transfection by the DNA or RNA molecule coding for the recombinant virus of the invention. The synthetic recombinant plasmid DNAs and RNAs of the invention can<br><br>
be replicated and rescued into infectious virus particles by any number of techniques known in the art, as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 5,166,057 issued November 24, 1992; in U.S. Patent No. 5,854,037 issued December 29, 1998; in European Patent Publication EP 0702085A1, published February 20,1996; in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/152,845; in International Patent Publications PCT WO97/12032 published April 3, 1997; W096/34625 published November 7, 1996; in European Patent Publication EP-A780475; WO 99/02657 published January 21, 1999; WO 98/53078 pubHshed November 26,1998; WO 98/02530 published January 22, 1998; WO 99/15672 published April 1, 1999; WO 98/13501 published April 2, 1998; WO 97/06270 published February 20, 1997; and EPO 780 47SA1 pubUshed June 25, 1997, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
In one embodiment, of the present invention, synthetic recombinant viral RNAs may be prepared that contain the non-coding regions of the negative strand virus RNA which are essential for the recognition by viral polymerases and for packaging signals necessary to generate a mature virion. There are a number of different approaches which may be used to apply the reverse genetics approach to rescue negative strand RNA viruses. First, the recombinant RNAs are synthesized from a recombinant DNA template and reconstituted in vitro with purified viral polymerase complex to form recombinant ribonucleoproteins (R&gt;JPs) which can be used to transfect cells. In another approach, a more efficient transfection is achieved if the viral polymerase proteins are present during transcription of the synthetic RNAs either in vitro or in vivo. With this approach the synthetic RNAs may be transcribed from cDNA plasmids which are either co-transcribed in vitro with cDNA plasmids encoding the polymerase proteins, or transcribed in vivo in the presence of polymerase proteins, i.e., in cells which transiently or constitutively express the polymerase proteins.<br>
In additional approaches described herein, the production of infectious chimeric or recombinant virus may be replicated in host cell systems that express a metapneumoviral polymerase protein (e.g., in virus/host cell expression systems; transformed cell lines engineered to express a polymerase protein, etc.), so that infectious chimeric or recombinant virus are rescued. In this instance, helper virus need not be utilized since this function is provided by the viral polymerase proteins expressed.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, any technique known to those of skill in the art may be used to achieve replication and rescue of recombinant and chimeric viruses. One<br><br>
approach involves supplying viral proteins and functions required for replication in vitro prior to transfecting host cells. In such an embodiment, viral proteins may be supplied in the form of wildtype virus, helper virus, purified viral proteins or recombinantly expressed viral proteins. The viral proteins may be supplied prior to, during or post transcription of the synthetic cDNAs or RNAs encoding the chimeric virus. The entire mixture may be used to transfect host cells. In another approach, viral proteins and functions required for replication may be supplied prior to or during transcription of the synthetic cDNAs or RNAs encoding the chimeric virus. In such an embodiment, viral proteins and functions required for replication are supplied in the form of wildtype virus, helper virus, viral extracts, synthetic cDNAs or RNAs which express the viral proteins are introduced into the host cell via infection or transfection. This infection/transfection takes place prior to or simultaneous to the introduction of the synthetic cDNAs or RNAs encoding the chimeric virus.<br>
In a particularly desirable approach, cells engineered to express all viral genes or chimeric or recombinant virus of the invention, i.e., APV, MPV, MPV/APV or APV/MPV, may result in the production of infectious virus which contain the desired genotype; thus eliminating the need for a selection system. Theoretically, one can replace any one of the ORFs or part of any one of the ORFs encoding structural proteins of MPV with a foreign sequence. However, a necessary part of this equation is the ability to propagate the defective virus (defective because a normal viral gene product is missing or altered). A number of possible approaches exist to circumvent this problem. In one approach a virus having a mutant protein can be grown in cell lines which are constructed to constitutively express the wild type version of the same protein. By this way, the cell line complements the mutation in the virus. Similar techniques may be used to construct transformed cell lines that constitutively express any of the MPV genes. These cell lines which are made to express the viral protein may be used to complement the defect in the chimeric or recombinant virus and thereby propagate it. Alternatively, certain natural host range systems may be available to propagate chimeric or recombinant virus.<br>
In yet another embodiment, viral proteins and functions required for replication may be supplied as genetic material in the form of synthetic cDNAs or RNAs so that they are co-transcribed with the synthetic cDNAs or RNAs encoding the chimeric virus. In a particularly desirable approach, plasmids which express the chimeric virus and the viral polymerase<br><br>
and/or other viral functions are co-transfected into host cells. For example, plasmids encoding the genomic or antigenomic APV, MPV, MPV/APV or APV/MPV RNA, with or without one or more heterologous sequences, may be co-transfected into host cells with plasmids encoding the metapneumoviral polymerase proteins N, P, L, or M2-1. Alternatively, rescue of the recombinant viruses of the invention may be accomplished by the use of Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) encoding T7 RNA polymerase, or a combination of MVA and plasmids encoding the polymerase proteins (N, P, and L). For example, MVA-T7 or Fowl Pox-T7 can be infected into Vero cells, LLC-MK-2 cells, Hep-2 cells, LF 1043 (HEL) cells, tMK cells, LLC-MK2, HUT 292, FRHL-2 (rhesus), FCL-1 (green monkey), WI-38 (human), MRC-5 (human) cells, 293 T cells, QT 6 cells, QT 35 cells and CEF cells. After infection with MVA-T7 or Fowl Pox-T7, a full length antigenomic cDNA encoding the recombinant virus of the invention may be transfected into the cells together with the N, P, L, and M2-1 encoding expression plasmids. Alternatively, the polymerase may be provided by plasmid transfection. The cells and cell supernatant can subsequently be harvested and subjected to a single freeze-thaw cycle. The resulting cell lysate may then be used to infect a fresh HeLa or Vero cell monolayer in the presence of 1-beta-D-arabinofiiranosylcytosine (ara C), a replication inhibitor of vaccinia virus, to generate a virus stock. The supernatant and cells from these plates can then be harvested, freeze-thawed once and the presence of recombinant virus particles of the invention can be assayed by immunostaining of virus plaques using antiserum specific to the particular virus.<br>
Another approach to propagating the chimeric or recombinant virus may involve co-cultivation with wild-type virus. This could be done by simply taking recombinant virus and co-infecting cells with this and another wild-type virus. The wild-type virus should complement for the defective virus gene product and allow growth of both the wild-type and recombinant virus. Alternatively, a helper virus may be used to support propagation of the recombinant virus.<br>
In another approach, synthetic templates may be replicated in cells co-infected with recombinant viruses that express the metapneumovirus polymerase protein. In fact, this method may be used to rescue recombinant infectious virus in accordance with the invention. To this end, the metapneumovirus polymerase protein may be expressed in any expression vector/host cell system, including but not limited to viral expression vectors (e.g., vaccinia<br><br>
virus, adenovirus, baculovirus, etc.) or cell lines that express a polymerase protein (e.g . 5eeKrystal et ai, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 2709-2713). Moreover, infection of host cells expressing all metapneumovirus proteins may result in the production of infectious chimeric virus particles. It should be noted that it may be possible to construct a recombinant virus without altering virus viability. These altered viruses would then be growth competent and would not need helper functions to replicate.<br>
Transfection procedures are well-known to the skill artisan and include, but are not limited to, DEAE-dextran-mediated, Calcium phosphate-mediated, Electroporation, and Liposome-mediated transfection.<br>
A full-length viral genome can be assembled from several smaller PCR fragments. Restriction maps of different isolates of hMPV are shown in Figure 28. The restriction sites can be used to assemble the full-length construct. In certain embodiments, PCR primers are designed such that the fragment resulting from the PCR reaction has a restriction site close to its 5' end and a restriction site close to it 3' end. The PCR product can then be digested with the respective restriction enzymes and subsequently ligated to the neighboring PCR fragments.<br>
5.7      ATTENUATION OF RECOMBINANT VIRUSES<br>
The recombinant viruses of the invention can be fiirther genetically engineered to exhibit an attenuated phenotype. In particular, the recombinant viruses of the invention exhibit an attenuated phenotype in a subject to which the virus is administered as a vaccine. Attenuation can be achieved by any method known to a skilled artisan. Without being bound by theory, the attenuated phenotype of the recombinant virus can be caused, e.g., by using a virus that naturally does not replicate well in an intended host {e.g., using an APV in human), by reduced replication of the viral genome, by reduced ability of the virus to infect a host cell, or by reduced ability of the viral proteins to assemble to an infectious viral particle relative to the wild type strain of the virus. The viability of certain sequences of the virus, such as the leader and the trailer sequence can be tested using a minigenome assay {see section 5.8).<br>
The attenuated phenotypes of a recombinant virus of the invention can be tested by any method known to the artisan (see, e.g., section 5.8). A candidate virus can, for example, be tested for its ability to infect a host or for the rate of replication in a cell culture system. In<br><br>
certain embodiments, a mimi-genome system is used to test the attenuated virus when the gene that is altered is N, P, L, M2, F, G, M2-1, M2-2 or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, growth curves at different temperatures are used to test the attenuated phenotype of the virus. For example, an attenuated virus is able to grow at 35°C, but not at 39°C or 40°C. In certain embodiments, different cell lines can be used to evaluate the attenuated phenotype of the virus. For example, an attenuated virus may only be able to grow in monkey cell lines but not the human cell lines, or the achievable virus titers in different cell lines are different for the attenuated virus. In certain embodiments, viral replication in the respiratory tract of a small animal model, including but not limited to, hamsters, cotton rats, mice and guinea pigs, is used to evaluate the attenuated phenotypes of the virus. In other embodiments, the immune response induced by the virus, including but not limited to, the antibody titers (e.g., assayed by plaque reduction neutralization assay or ELISA) is used to evaluate the attenuated phenotypes of the virus. In a specific embodiment, the plaque reduction neutralization assay or ELISA is carried out at a low dose. In certain embodiments, the ability of the recombinant virus to elicit pathological symptoms in an animal model can be tested. A reduced ability of the virus to elicit pathological symptoms in an animal model system is indicative of its attenuated phenotype. In a specific embodiment, the candidate viruses are tested in a monkey model for nasal infection, indicated by mucous production.<br>
The viruses of the invention can be attenuated such that one or more of the functional characteristics of the virus are impaired. In certain embodiments, attenuation is measured in comparison to the wild type strain of the virus from which the attenuated virus is derived. In other embodiments, attenuation is determined by comparing the growth of an attenuated virus in different host systems. Thus, for a non-limiting example, an APV is said to be attenuated when grown in a human host if the growth of the APV in the human host is reduced compared to the growth of the APV in an avian host.<br>
In certain embodiments, the attenuated virus of the invention is capable of infecting a host, is capable of replicating in a host such that infectious viral particles are produced. In comparison to the wild type strain, however, the attenuated strain grows to lower titers or grows more slowly. Any technique known to the skilled artisan can be used to determine the growth curve of the attenuated virus and compare it to the growth curve of the wild type virus. For exemplary methods see Example section, infra. In a specific embodiment, the<br><br>
attenuated virus grows to a titer of less than 10 pfu/ml, of less than 10'* pfu/ml, of less than 10 pfu/ral, or of less than 10 pfu/ml in Vero cells under conditions as described in,Vg., Example 22.<br>
In certain embodiments, the attenuated virus of the invention (e.g., a chimeric mammalian MPV) cannot replicate in human cells as well as the wild type virus (e.g., wild type mammahan MPV) does. However, the attenuated virus can replicate well in a cell line that lack interferon functions, such as Vero cells.<br>
In other embodiments, the attenuated virus of the invention is capable of infecting a host, of replicating in the host, and of causing proteins of the virus of the invention to be inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane, but the attenuated virus does not cause the host to produce new infectious viral particles. In certain embodiments, the attenuated virus infects the host, replicates in the host, and causes viral proteins to be inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane of the host with the same efficiency as the wild type mammalian virus. In other embodiments, the ability of the attenuated virus to cause viral proteins to be inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane into the host cell is reduced compared to the wild type virus. In certain embodiments, the ability of the attenuated mammalian virus to replicate in the host is reduced compared to the wild type virus. Any technique known to the skilled artisan can be used to determine whether a virus is capable of infecting a mammalian cell, of replicating within the host, and of causing viral proteins to be inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane of the host. For illustrative methods see section 5.8.<br>
In certain embodiments, the attenuated virus of the invention is capable of infecting a host. In contrast to the wild type mammalian MPV, however, the attenuated mammalian MPV carmot be replicated in the host. In a specific embodiment, the attenuated mammalian virus can infect a host and can cause the host to insert viral proteins in its cytoplasmic membranes, but the attenuated virus is incapable of being replicated in the host. Any method known to the skilled artisan can be used to test whether the attenuated mammalian MPV has infected the host and has caused the host to insert viral proteins in its cytoplasmic membranes.<br>
In certain embodiments, the ability of the attenuated mammalian virus to infect a host is reduced compared to the ability of the wild type virus to infect the same host. Any<br><br>
technique known to the skilled artisan can be used to determine whether a virus is capable of infecting a host. For illustrative methods see section 5.8.<br>
In certain embodiments, mutations (e.g., missense mutations) are introduced into the genome of the virus to generated a virus with an attenuated phenotype. Mutations (e.g., missense mutations) can be introduced into the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene of the recombinant virus. Mutations can be additions, substitutions, deletions, or combinations thereof. In specific embodiments, a single amino acid deletion mutation for the N, P, L, F, G, M2-1, M2-2 or M2 proteins is introduced, which can be screened for functionality in the mini-genome assay system and be evaluated for predicted functionality in the virus. In more specific embodiments, the missense mutation is a cold-sensitive mutation. In other embodiments, the missense mutation is a heat-sensitive mutation. In one embodiment, major phosphorylation sites of P protein of the virus is removed. In another embodiment, a mutation or mutations are introduced into the L gene of the virus to generate a temperature sensitive strain. In yet another embodiment, the cleavage site of the F gene is mutated in such a way that cleavage does not occur or occurs at very low efficiency.<br>
In other embodiments, deletions are introduced into the genome of the recombinant virus. In more specific embodiments, a deletion can be introduced into the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene of the recombinant virus. In specific embodiments, the deletion is in the M2-gene of the recombinant virus of the present invention. In other specific embodiments, the deletion is in the SH-gene of the recombinant virus of the present invention. In yet another specific embodiment, both the M2-gene and the SH-gene are deleted.<br>
In certain embodiments, the intergenic region of the recombinant virus is altered. In one embodiment, the length of the intergenic region is altered. In another embodiment, the intergenic regions are shuffled from 5' to 3' end of the viral genome.<br>
In other embodiments, the genome position of a gene or genes of the recombinant vims is changed. In one embodiment, the F or G gene is moved to the 3' end of the genome. In another embodiment, the N gene is moved to the 5' end of the genome.<br>
In certain embodiments, attenuation of the virus is achieved by replacing a gene of the wild type virus with a gene of a virus of a different species, of a different subgroup, or of a<br><br>
different variant. In illustrative embodiments, the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene of a mammalian MPV is replaced with the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene, respectively, of an APV. In other illustrative embodiments, the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene of APV is replaced with the N-gene, the P-gene, the M-gene, the F-gene, the M2-gene, the SH-gene, the G-gene or the L-gene, respectively, of a mammalian MPV. In a preferred embodiment, attenuation of the vims is achieved by replacing one or more polymerase associated genes (e.g., N, P, L or M2) with genes of a virus of a different species.<br>
In certain embodiments, attenuation of the virus is achieved by replacing one or more specific domains of a protein of the wild type virus with domains derived from the corresponding protein of a virus of a different species. In an illustrative embodiment, the ectodomain of a F protein of APV is replaced with an ectodomain of a F protein of a mammalian MPV. In a preferred embodiment, one or more specific domains of L, N, or P protein are replaced with domains derived from corresponding proteins of a virus of a different species. In certain other embodiments, attenuation of the virus is achieved by deleting one or more specific domains of a protein of the wild type virus. In a specific embodiment, the transmembrane domain of the F-protein is deleted.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the leader and/or trailer sequence of the recombinant virus of the invention can be modified to achieve an attenuated phenotype. In certain, more specific embodiments, the leader and/or trailer sequence is reduced in length relative to the wild type virus by at least 1 nucleotide, at least 2 nucleotides, at least 3 nucleotides, at least 4 nucleofides, at least 5 nucleotides or at least 6 nucleotides. In certain other, more specific embodiments, the sequence of the leader and/or trailer of the recombinant virus is mutated. In a specific embodiment, the leader and the trailer sequence are 100% complementary to each other. In other embodiments, 1 nucleotide, 2 nucleotides, 3 nucleotides, 4 nucleotides, 5 nucleotides, 6 nucleotides, 7 nucleotides, 8 nucleotides, 9 nucleotides, or 10 nucleotides are not complementary to each other where the remaining nucleotides of the leader and the trailer sequences are complementary to each other. In certain embodiments, the non-complementary nucleotides are identical to each other. In certain other embodiments, the non-complementary nucleotides are different from each other.<br><br>
In other embodiments, if the non-complementary nucleotide in the trailer is purine, the corresponding nucleotide in the leader sequence is also a purine. In other embodiments, if the non-complementary nucleotide in the trailer is pyrimidine, the corresponding nucleotide in the leader sequence is also a purine.<br>
When a live attenuated vaccine is used, its safety must also be considered. The vaccine must not cause disease. Any techniques known in the art that can make a vaccine safe may be used in the present invention. In addition to attenuation techniques, other techniques may be used. One non-limiting example is to use a soluble heterologous gene that carmot be incorporated into the virion membrane. For example, a single copy of the soluble RSV F gene, a version of the RSV gene lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, can be used. Since it cannot be incorporated into the virion membrane, the virus tropism is not expected to change.<br>
Various assays can be used to test the safety of a vaccine. See section 5.8, infra. Particularly, sucrose gradients and neutralization assays can be used to test the safety. A sucrose gradient assay can be used to detennine whether a heterologous protein is inserted in a virion. If the heterologous protein is inserted in the virion, the virion should be tested for its ability to cause symptoms even if the parental strain does not cause symptoms. Without being bound by theory, if the heterologous protein is incorporated in the virion, the virus may have acquired new, possibly pathological, properties.<br>
5.8      ASSAYS FOR USE WITH THE INVENTION<br>
A number of assays may be employed in accordance with the present invention in order to determine the rate of growth of a chimeric or recombinant virus in a cell culture system, an animal model system or in a subject. A number of assays may also be employed in accordance with the present invention in order to determine the requirements of the chimeric and recombinant viruses to achieve infection, replication and packaging of virions.<br>
The assays described herein may be used to assay viral titre over time to determine the growth characteristics of the virus. In a specific embodiment, the viral titre is determined by obtaining a sample from the infected cells or the infected subject, preparing a serial dilution of the sample and infecting a monolayer of cells that are susceptible to infection with the virus at a dilution of the virus that allows for the emergence of single plaques. The plaques<br><br>
can then be counted and the viral titre express as plaque forming units per milliliter of sample. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the growth rate of a virus of the invention in a subject is estimated by the titer of antibodies against the virus in the subject. Without being bound by theory, the antibody titer in the subject reflects not only the viral titer in the subject but also the antigenicity. If the antigenicity of the virus is constant, the increase of the antibody titer in the subject can be used to determine the growth curve of the virus in the subject. In a preferred embodiment, the growth rate of the virus in animals or humans is best tested by sampling biological fluids of a host at multiple time points post-infection and measuring viral titer.<br>
The expression of heterologous gene sequence in a cell cuhure system or in a subject can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan. In certain embodiments, the expression of the heterologous gene is measured by quantifying the level of the transcript. The level of the transcript can be measured by Northern blot analysis or by RT-PCR using probes or primers, respectively, that are specific for the transcript. The transcript can be distinguished fi-om the genome of the virus because the virus is in the antisense orientation whereas the transcript is in the sense orientation. In certain embodiments, the expression of the heterologous gene is measured by quantifying the level of the protein product of the heterologous gene. The level of the protein can be measured by Western blot analysis using antibodies that are specific to the protein.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the heterologous gene is tagged with a peptide tag. The peptide tag can be detected using antibodies against the peptide tag. The level of peptide tag detected is representative for the level of protein expressed from the heterologous gene. Alternatively, the protein expressed fi-om the heterologous gene can be isolated by virtue of the peptide tag. The amount of the purified protein correlates with the expression level of the heterologous gene. Such peptide tags and methods for the isolation of proteins fused to such a peptide tag are well known in the art. A variety of peptide tags known in the art may be used in the modification of the heterologous gene, such as, but not limited to, the immunoglobulin constant regions, polyhistidine sequence (Petty, 1996, Metal-chelate affinity chromatography, in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, volume 1-3 (1994-1998). Ed. by Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R., Kunston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A. and Struhl, K. Published by John Wiley and sons. Inc., USA, Greene Pubhsh. Assoc. &amp; Wiley<br><br>
Interscience), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Smith, 1993, Methods Mol. Cell Bio. 4:220-229), the E. coli maltose binding protein (Guan et a!., 1987, Gene 67:21-30), various cellulose binding domains (U.S. patent 5,496,934; 5,202,247; 5,137,819; Tomme et a!., 1994, Protein Eng. 7:117-123), and the FLAG epitope (Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1999, Ed. Ausubel et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Unit 10.11) etc. Other peptide tags are recognized by specific binding partners and thus facilitate isolation by affinity binding to the binding partner, which is preferably immobilized and/or on a solid support. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, many methods can be used to obtain the coding region of the above-mentioned peptide tags, including but not limited to, DNA cloning, DNA amplification, and synthetic methods. Some of the peptide tags and reagents for their detection and isolation are available conunercially.<br>
Samples from a subject can be obtained by any method known to the skilled artisan. In certain embodiments, the sample consists of nasal aspirate, throat swab, sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage.<br>
5.8.1    MINIREPLICON CONSTRUCTS<br>
Minireplicon constructs can be generated to contain an antisense reporter gene. Any reporter gene knovra to the skilled artisan can be used with the invention {see section 5.8.2). In a specific embodiment, the reporter gene is CAT. In certain embodiments, the reporter gene can be flanked by the negative-sense hMPV or APV leader linked to the hepatitis delta ribozyme (Hep-d Ribo) and T7 polymerase termination (T-T7) signals, and the hMPV or APV trailer sequence preceded by the T7 RNA polymerase promoter.<br>
In certain embodiments, the plasmid encoding the minireplicon is transfected into a host cell. The host cell expresses T7 RNA polymerase, the N gene, the P gene, the L gene, and the M2.1 gene. In certain embodiments, the host cell is transfected with plasmids encoding T7 RNA polymerase, the N gene, the P gene, the L gene, and the M2.1 gene. In other embodiments, the plasmid encoding the minireplicon is transfected into a host cell and the host cell is infected with a helper virus.<br>
The expression level of the reporter gene and/or its activity can be assayed by any method known to the skilled artisan, such as, but not limited to, the methods described in section 5.8.2.<br><br>
In certain, more specific, embodiments, the minireplicon comprises the following elements, in the order listed: T7 RNA Polymerase or RNA polymerase I, leader sequence, gene start, GFP, trailer sequence. Hepatitis delta ribozyme sequence or RNA polymerase I termination sequence. If T7 is used as RNA polymerase. Hepatitis delta ribozyme sequence should be used as termination sequence. If RNA polymerase I is used, RNA polymerase I termination sequence may be used as a termination signal. Dependent on the rescue system, the sequence of the minireplicon can be in the sense or antisense orientation. In certain embodiments, the leader sequence can be modified relative to the wild type leader sequence of hMPV. The leader sequence can optionally be preceded by an AC. The T7 promoter sequence can be with or without a G-doublet or triplet, where the G-doublet or triplet provides for increased transcription.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a cell is infected with hMPV at TO. 24 hours later, at T24, the cell is transfected with a minireplicon construct. 48 hours after TO and 72 hours after TO, the cells are tested for the expression of the reporter gene. If a fluorescent reporter gene product is used (e.g., GFP), the expression of the reporter gene can be tested using FACS.<br>
In another embodiment, a cell is transfected with six plasmids at T=0 hours. Cells are then harvested at T=40 hours and T=60 hours and analyzed for CAT or GFP expression. (See Figure 25.)<br>
In another specific embodiment, a cell is infected with MVA-T7 at TO. 1 hour later, at Tl, the cell is transfected with a minireplicon construct. 24 hours after TO, the cell is infected with hMPV. 72 hours after TO, the cells are tested for the expression of the reporter gene. If a fluorescent reporter gene product is used (e.g., GFP), the expression of the reporter gene can be tested using FACS.<br>
5.8.2    REPORTER GENES<br>
In certain embodiments, assays for measurement of reporter gene expression in tissue culture or in animal models can be used with the methods of the invention. The nucleotide sequence of the reporter gene is cloned into the virus, such as APV, hMPV, hMPV/APV or APV/hMPV, wherein (i) the position of the reporter gene is changed and (ii) the length of the intergenic regions flanking the reporter gene are varied. Different combinations are tested to<br><br>
determine the optimal rate of expression of the reporter gene and the optimal replication rate of the virus comprising the reporter gene.<br>
In certain embodiments, minireplicon constructs are generated to include a reporter gene. The construction of minireplicon constructs is described herein.<br>
The abundance of the reporter gene product can be determined by any technique known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques include, but are not limited to. Northern blot analysis or Western blot analysis using probes or antibodies, respectively, that are specific to the reporter gene.<br>
In certain embodiments, the reporter gene emits a fluorescent signal that can be detected in a FACS. FACS can be used to detect cells in which the reporter gene is expressed.<br>
Techniques for practicing the specific aspect of this invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA manipulation and production, which are routinely practiced by one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual, second ed., vol. 1-3. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1989), A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition; DNA Cloning, Volumes J and II (Glover, Ed. 1985); and Transcription and Translation (Hames &amp; Higgins, Eds. 1984).<br>
The biochemical activity of the reporter gene product represents the expression level of the reporter gene. The total level of reporter gene activity depends also on the replication rate of the recombinant virus of the invention. Thus, to determine the true expression level of the reporter gene from the recombinant virus, the total expression level should be divided by the titer of the recombinant virus in the cell culture or the animal model.<br>
Reporter genes that can be used with the methods of invention include, but are not limited to, the genes listed in the Table 4 below:<br><br><br>
The abundance of the reporter gene can be measured by, inter alia. Western blot analysis or Northern blot analysis or any other technique used for the quantification of transcription of a nucleotide sequence, the abundance of its mRNA its protein (seeShort Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., (editors), John Wiley &amp; Sons, hic, 4* edition, 1999). In certain embodiments, the activity of the reporter gene product is measured as a readout of reporter gene expression from the recombinant virus. For the quantification of the activity of the reporter gene product, biochemical characteristics of the reporter gene product can be employed {see Table 4). The methods for measuring the biochemical activity of the reporter gene products are well-known to the skilled artisan. A more detailed description of<br><br>
illustrative reporter genes that can be used with the methods of the invention is set forth below.<br>
5.8.3    MEASUREMENT OF INCIDENCE OF INFECTION RATE<br>
The incidence of infection can be determined by any method well-known in the art, for example, but not limited to, clinical samples (e.g., nasal swabs) can be tested for the presence of a virus of the invention by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using an anti-APV-antigen antibody, an anti-hMPV-antigen antibody, an anti-APV-antigen antibody, and/or an antibody that is specific to the gene product of the heterologous nucleotide sequence, respectively.<br>
In certain embodiments, samples containing intact cells can be directly processed, whereas isolates without intact cells should first be cultured on a permissive cell Hne (e.g. HEp-2 cells). In an illustrative embodiments, cultured cell suspensions should be cleared by centrifugation at, e.g., 300xg for 5 minutes at room temperature, followed by a PBS, pH 7.4 (Ca++ and Mg-H- free) wash under the same conditions. Cell pellets are resuspended in a small volume of PBS for analysis. Primary clinical isolates containing intact cells are mixed with PBS and centrifiiged at SOOxg for 5 minutes at room temperature. Mucus is removed from the interface with a sterile pipette tip and cell pellets are washed once more with PBS under the same conditions. Pellets are then resuspended in a small volume of PBS for analysis. Five to ten microliters of each cell suspension are spotted per 5 mm well on acetone washed 12-well HTC supercured glass slides and allowed to air dry. Slides are fixed in cold (-20°C) acetone for 10 minutes. Reactions are blocked by adding PBS -1% BSA to each well followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature. Slides are washed three times in PBS - 0.1% Tween-20 and air dried. Ten microliters of each primary antibody reagent diluted to 250 ng/ml in blocking buffer is spotted per well and reactions are incubated in a humidified 37°C environment for 30 minutes. Slides are then washed extensively in three changes of PBS - 0.1% Tween-20 and air dried. Ten microliters of appropriate secondary conjugated antibody reagent diluted to 250 ng/ml in blocking buffer are spotted per respective well and reactions are incubated in a humidified 37 °C environment for an additional 30 minutes. Slides are then washed in three changes of PBS - 0.1% Tween-20. Five microliters of PBS-50% glycerol-10 mM Tris pH 8.0-1 mM EDTA are spotted per reaction well, and<br><br>
slides are mounted with cover slips. Each reaction well is subsequently analyzed by fluorescence microscopy at 200X power using a B-2A filter (EX 450-490 nm). Positive reactions are scored against an autofluorescent background obtained from unstained cells or cells stained with secondary reagent alone. Positive reactions are characterized by bright fluorescence punctuated with small inclusions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.<br>
5.8.4	MEASUREMENT OF SERUM TITER<br>
Antibody serum titer can be determined by any method well-known in the art, for example, but not limited to, the amount of antibody or antibody fragment in serum samples can be quantitated by a sandwich ELISA. Briefly, the ELISA consists of coating microtiter plates overnight at 4°C with an antibody that recognizes the antibody or antibody fragment in the serum. The plates are then blocked for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature with PBS-Tween-0.5% BSA. Standard curves are constructed using purified antibody or antibody fragment diluted in PBS-TWEEN-BSA, and samples are diluted in PBS-BSA. The samples and standards are added to duplicate wells of the assay plate and are incubated for approximately 1 hour at room temperature. Next, the non-bound antibody is washed away with PBS-TWEEN and the bound antibody is treated with a labeled secondary antibody (e.g., horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-human IgG) for approximately 1 hour at room temperature. Binding of the labeled antibody is detected by adding a chromogenic substrate specific for the label and measuring the rate of substrate turnover, e.g., by a spectrophotometer. The concentration of antibody or antibody fragment levels in the serum is determined by comparison of the rate of substrate turnover for the samples to the rate of substrate turnover for the standard curve at a certain dilution.<br>
5.8.5	SEROLOGICAL TESTS<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the presence of antibodies that bind to a component of a mammalian MPV is detected. In particular the presence of antibodies directed to a protein of a mammalian MPV can be detected in a subject to diagnose the presence of a mammalian MPV in the subject. Any method known to the skilled artisan can be used to detect the presence of antibodies directed to a component of a mammalian MPV.<br><br>
In an illustrative embodiment, components of mammalian MPV are linked to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the component of the mammalian MPV can be, but is not limited to, the F protein or the G protein. Subsequently, the material that is to be tested for the presence of antibodies directed to mammalian MPV is incubated with the solid support under conditions conducive to the binding of the antibodies to the mammalian MPV components. Subsequently, the solid support is washed under conditions that remove any unspecifically bound antibodies. Following the washing step, the presence of bound antibodies can be detected using any technique known to the skilled artisan. In a specific embodiment, the mammalian MPV protein-antibody complex is incubated with detectably labeled antibody that recognizes antibodies that were generated by the species of the subject, e.g., if the subject is a cotton rat, the detectably labeled antibody is directed to rat antibodies, under conditions conducive to the binding of the detectably labeled antibody to the antibody that is bound to the component of mammalian MPV. In a specific embodiment, the detectably labeled antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic activity. In another embodiment, the detectably labeled antibody is radioactively labeled. The complex of mammalian MPV protein-antibody-detectably labeled antibody is then washed, and subsequently the presence of the detectably labeled antibody is quantified by any technique known to the skilled artisan, wherein the technique used is dependent on the type of label of the detectably labeled antibody.<br>
5.8.6    BIACORE ASSAY<br>
Determination of the kinetic parameters of antibody binding can be determined for example by the injection of 250 lL of monoclonal antibody ("mAb") at varying concentration in HBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20 over a sensor chip surface, onto which has been immobihzed the antigen. The antigen can be any component of a mammalian MPV. In a specific embodiment, the antigen can be, but is not limited to, the F protein or the G protein of a mammalian MPV. The flow rate is maintained constant at 75uL/min. Dissociation data is collected for 15 min, or longer as necessary. Following each injection/dissociation cycle, the bound mAb is removed from the antigen surface using brief, 1 min pulses of dilute acid, typically 10-100 mM HCl, though other regenerants are employed as the circumstances warrant.<br><br>
More specifically, for measurement of the rates of association, k, and dissociation, kff, the antigen is directly immobilized onto the sensor chip surface through the use of standard amine coupling chemistries, namely the EDC/NHS method (EDC= N-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide). Briefly, a 5-100 nM solution of the antigen in 10 mM NaOAc, pH4 or pH5 is prepared and passed over the EDC/NHS-activated surface until approximately 30-50 RU's (Biacore Resonance Unit) worth of antigen are immobilized. Following this, the unreacted active esters are "capped" off with an injection of IM Et-NH2. A blank surface, containing no antigen, is prepared under identical immobilization conditions for reference purposes. Once a suitable surface has been prepared, an appropriate dilution series of each one of the antibody reagents is prepared in HBS/Tween-20, and passed over both the antigen and reference cell surfaces, which are cormected in series. The range of antibody concentrations that are prepared varies depending on what the equilibrium binding constant, KD, is estimated to be. As described above, the bound antibody is removed after each injection/dissociation cycle using an appropriate regenerant.<br>
Once an entire data set is collected, the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using algorithms supplied by the instrument manufacturer, BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). All data are fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. These algorithm calculate both the kg„ and the kp from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant, KD, is deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants {i.e. kjj/k„). More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluation Software Handbook (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ).<br>
5.8.7    MICRONEUTRALIZATION ASSAY<br>
The ability of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof to neutrahze virus infectivity is determined by a microneutralization assay. This microneutralization assay is a modification of the procedures described by Anderson et al., (1985, J. Clin. Microbiol. 22:1050-1052, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The procedure is also described in Johnson et al., 1999, J. Infectious Diseases 180:35-40, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Antibody dilutions are made in triplicate using a 96-well plate. 10* TCID50 of a mammalian MPV are incubated with serial dilutions of the antibody or antigen-binding<br><br>
fragments thereof to be tested for 2 hours at 37°C in the wells of a 96-welI plate. Cells susceptible to infection with a mammalian MPV, such as, but not limited to Vero cells (2.5 x 10") are then added to each well and cultured for 5 days at 37°C in 5% COj. After 5 days, the medium is aspirated and cells are washed and fixed to the plates with 80% methanol and 20% PBS. Virus replication is then determined by viral antigen, such as F protein expression. Fixed cells are incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-viral antigen, such as anti-F protein monoclonal antibody (e.g., pan F protein, C-site-specific MAb 133-lH) washed and horseradish peroxidase conjugated avidin is added to the wells. The wells are washed again and tumover of substrate TMB (thionitrobenzoic acid) is measured at 450 nm. The neutralizing titer is expressed as the antibody concentration that causes at least 50%) reduction in absorbency at 450 nm (the OD450) from virus-only control cells.<br>
The microneutralization assay described here is only one example. Alternatively, standard neutraUzation assays can be used to determine how significantly the virus is affected by an antibody.<br>
5.8.8	VIRAL FUSION INHIBITION ASSAY<br>
This assay is in principle identical to the microneutralization assay, except that the cells are infected with the respective virus for four hours prior to addition of antibody and the read-out is in terms of presence of absence of fiision of cells (Taylor et al., 1992, J. Gen. Virol. 73:2217-2223).<br>
5.8.9	ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY<br>
Thermodynamic binding affinities and enthalpies are determined from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigen.<br>
Antibodies are diluted in dialysate and the concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopic absorption measurements with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4B Spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient of 217,000 M' cm' at the peak maximum at 280 run. The diluted mammalian MPV-antigen concentrations are calculated from the ratio of the mass of the original sample to that of the diluted sample since its extinction coefficient is too low to determine an accurate concentration without employing and losing a large amount of sample.<br><br>
ITC Measurements<br>
The binding thermodynamics of the antibodies are determined from ITC measurements using a Microcal, Inc. VP Titration Calorimeter. The VP titration calorimeter consists of a matched pair of sample and reference vessels (1.409 ml) enclosed in an adiabatic enclosure and a rotating stirrer-syringe for titrating ligand solutions into the sample vessel. The ITC measurements are performed at 25 °C and 35 °C. The sample vessel contained the antibody in the phosphate buffer while the reference vessel contains just the buffer solution. The phosphate buffer solution is saline 67 mM PO4 at pH 7.4 from HyClone, Inc. Five or ten 1 aliquots of the 0.05 to 0.1 mM RSV-antigen, PlV-antigen, and/or hMPV-antigen solution are titrated 3 to 4 minutes apart into the antibody sample solution until the binding is saturated as evident by the lack of a heat exchange signal.<br>
A non-linear, least square minimization software program from Microcal, Inc., Origin 5.0, is used to fit the incremental heat of the i-th titration (AQ (i)) of the total heat, Q„ to the total titrant concentration, X„ according to the following equations (I),<br>
Q, = nC,AHb°V{l + X/nC, + l/nKC, -[(1 + X/nC, + l/nKCJ - 4X/nC,]"'}/2   (la)<br>
AQ(i) = Q(i) + dVi/2V {Q(i) + Q(i-l)} - Q(i-l)	(lb)<br>
where C, is the initial antibody concentration in the sample vessel, V is the volume of the sample vessel, and n is the stoichiometry of the binding reaction, to yield values of K,, AHb°, and n. The optimum range of sample concentrations for the determination of Kb depends on the value of Kb and is defined by the following relationship.<br>
C, Kb n 
so that at I M the maximum Kb that can be determined is less than 2.5 X 10* M'. If the first titrant addition does not fit the binding isotherm, it was neglected in the final analysis since it may reflect release of an air bubble at the syringe opening-solution interface.<br><br>
5.8.10 IMMUNOASSAYS<br>
Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RJPA buffer (I % NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0. 1 % SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.0 1 M sodium phosphate at pH 7. 2, 1 % Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and/or protease inhibitors {e.g., EDTA, PMSF, 159 aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., to 4 hours) at 4 degrees C, adding protein A and/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 4 degrees C, washing the beads in lysis buffer and re-suspending the beads in SDS/saraple buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds., 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at pages 10,16,1.<br>
Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel {e.g., 8%- 20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide get to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane, in blocking solution {e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer {e.g., PBSTween20), incubating the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, incubating the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate {e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkahne phosphatase) or radioactive molecule {e.g., 'P or 'l) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding westem blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, GinTent Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.<br>
ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96-well microtiter plate with the antigen, washing away antigen that did not bind the wells, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the wells and incubating for a period of time, washing away unbound antibodies or non-specifically bound antibodies, and detecting the presence of the antibodies specifically bound to the antigen coating the well. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase). The parameters that can be modified to increase signal detection and other variations of ELISAs are well known to one of skill in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.<br>
The binding affinity of an antibody (including a scFv or other molecule comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof) to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., 'H or 'I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen.<br>
5.8.11 SUCROSE GRADIENT ASSAY<br>
The question of whether the heterologous proteins are incorporated into the virion can be further investigated by use of any biochemical assay known to the skilled artisan. In a specific embodiment, a sucrose gradient assay is used to determine whether a heterologous protein is incorporated into the virion.<br>
Infected cell lysates can be fractionated in 20 - 60% sucrose gradients, various fractions are collected and analyzed for the presence and distribution of heterologous proteins and the vector proteins by, e.g., Western blot analysis. The fractions and the virus proteins<br><br>
can also be assayed for peak virus titers by plaque assay. If the heterologous protein co-migrates with the virion the heterologous protein is associated with the virion.<br>
5.9      METHODS TO IDENTIFY NEW ISOLATES OF MPV<br>
The present invention relates to mammalian MPV, in particular hMPV. While the present invention provides the characterization of two serological subgroups of MPV, A and B, and the characterization of four variants of MPV Al, A2, Bl and B2, the invention is not limited to these subgroups and variants. The invention encompasses any yet to be identified isolates of MPV, including those which are characterized as belonging to the subgroups and variants described herein, or belonging to a yet to be characterized subgroup or variant.<br>
Immunoassays can be used in order to characterize the protein components that are present in a given sample. Immunoassays are an effective way to compare viral isolates using peptides components of the viruses for identification.   For example, the invention provides herein a method to identify further isolates of MPV as provided herein, the method comprising inoculating an essentially MPV-uninfected or specific-pathogen-free guinea pig or ferret (in the detailed description the animal is inoculated intranasally but other was of inoculation such as intramuscular or intradermal inoculation, and using an other experimental animal, is also feasible) with the prototype isolate 1-2614 or related isolates. Sera are collected from the animal at day zero, two weeks and three weeks post inoculation. The animal specifically seroconverted as measured in virus neutralization (VN) assay (For an example of a VN assay, see Example 16) and indirect IFA (For an example of IF A, see Example 11 or 14) against the respective isolate 1-2614 and the sera from the seroconverted animal are used in the immunological detection of said further isolates. As an example, the invention provides the characterization of a new member in the family of Paramyxoviridae, a human metapneumovirus or metapneumovirus-like virus (since its final taxonomy awaits discussion by a viral taxonomy committee the MPV is herein for example described as taxonomically corresponding to APV) (MPV) which may cause severe RTI in humans. The clinical signs of the disease caused by MPV are essentially similar to those caused by hRSV, such as cough, myalgia, vomiting, fever broncheolitis or pneumonia, possible conjunctivitis, or combinations thereof As is seen with hRSV infected children, specifically very young children may require hospitalization. As an example an MPV which was deposited<br><br>
January 19, 2001 as 1-2614 with CNCM, Institute Pasteur, Paris or a virus isolate phylogenetically corresponding therewith is herewith provided. Therewith, the invention provides a virus comprising a nucleic acid or functional fragment phylogenetically corresponding to a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ. K) NO: 19, or structurally corresponding therewith. In particular the invention provides a virus characterized in that after testing it in phylogenetic tree analysis wherein maximum likelihood trees are generated using 100 bootstraps and 3 jumbles it is found to be more closely phylogenetically corresponding to a virus isolate deposited as 1-2614 with CNCM, Paris than it is related to a virus isolate of avian pnuemovirus (APV) also known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), the aetiological agent of avian rhinotracheitis. It is particularly useful to use an AVP-C vims isolate as outgroup in said phylogenetic tree analysis, it being the closest relative, albeit being an essentially non-mammalian virus.<br>
5.9.1    BIOINFORMATICS ALIGNMENT OF SEQUENCES<br>
Two or more amino acid sequences can be compared by BLAST (Altschul, S.F. et al, 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) to determine their sequence homology and sequence identities to each other. Two or more nucleotide sequences can be compared by BLAST (Altschul, S.F. et al, 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) to determine their sequence homology and sequence identities to each other. BLAST comparisons can be performed using the Clustal W method (MacVector(tm)). In certain specific embodiments, the alignment of two or more sequences by a computer program can be followed by manual re-adjustment.<br>
The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide comparisons can be performed with the NBLAST program. BLAST amino acid sequence comparisons can be performed with the XBLAST program. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes. Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al, 1997, Nucleic Acids Res.25:3389-3402. Altematively, PSI-Blast can be used<br><br>
to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Altschul et al, 1997, supra). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs {e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used (seehttp://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.gov). Another preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988, CABIOS 4:11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table can be used. The gap length penalty can be set by the skilled artisan. The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, typically only exact matches are counted.<br>
5.9.2    HYBRIDIZATION CONDITIONS<br>
A nucleic acid which is hybridizable to a nucleic acid of a mammalian MPV, or to its reverse complement, or to its complement can be used in the methods of the invention to determine their sequence homology and identities to each other. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acids are hybridized under conditions of high stringency. By way of example and not limitation, procedures using such conditions of high stringency are as follows. Prehybridization of filters containing DNA is carried out for 8 h to overnight at 65 C in buffer composed of 6X SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters are hybridized for 48 h at 65 C in prehybridization mixture containing 100 ng/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5-20 X 106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Washing of filters is done at 37 C for 1 h in a solution containing 2X SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1 X SSC at 50 C for 45 min before autoradiography. Other conditions of high stringency which may be used are well known in the art. In other embodiments of the invention, hybridization is performed under moderate of low stringency conditions, such conditions are well-known to the skilled artisan {see e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; see also, Ausubel et al., eds., in the Current Protocols in Molecular Biology series of<br><br>
laboratory technique manuals, 1987-1997 Current Protocols,© 1994-1997 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.).<br>
5.9.3    PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS<br>
This invention relates to the inference of phylogenetic relationships between isolates of mammalian MPV. Many methods or approaches are available to analyze phylogenetic relationship; these include distance, maximum likehhood, and maximum parsimony methods (Swofford, DL., et. al., Phylogenetic Inference. In Molecular Systematics. Eds. Hillis, DM, Mortiz, C, and Mable, BK. 1996. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts, USA. pp. 407 - 514; Felsenstein, J., 1981, J. Mol. Evol. 17:368-376). Ln addition, bootstrapping techniques are an effective means of preparing and examining confidence intervals of resultant phylogenetic trees (Felsenstein, J., 1985, Evolution. 29:783-791). Any method or approach using nucleotide or peptide sequence information to compare mammalian MPV isolates can be used to establish phylogenetic relationships, including, but not limited to, distance, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony methods or approaches.

5.10     GENERATION OF ANTIBODIES<br>
The invention also relates to the generation of antibodies against a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV. In particular, the invention relates to the generation of antibodies against all MPV antigens, including the F protein, N protein, M2-1 protein, M2-2 protein, G protein, or P protein of a mammalian MPV. According to the invention, any protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, derivatives, analogs or fragments thereof, may be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies which immunospecifically bind such an immunogen. Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab') fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments. The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type {e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class {e.g., IgG,, IgGj, IgGj, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Examples of immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules include F(ab) and F(ab')2 fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody with an enzyme such as pepsin or papain. In a specific embodiment, antibodies to a protein encoded by human MPV are produced. In another embodiment, antibodies to a domain a protein encoded by human MPV are produced.<br>
Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies against a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, derivatives, analogs or fragments thereof For the production of antibody, various host animals can be immunized by injection with the native protein, or a synthetic version, or derivative {e.g., fragment) thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, etc. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active<br><br>
substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacterium parvum.<br>
For preparation of monoclonal antibodies directed toward a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, derivatives, analogs or fragments thereof, any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell hnes in culture may be used. For example, the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256:495-497), as well as the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al, 1983, Immunology Today 4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., 1985, in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). hi an additional embodiment of the invention, monoclonal antibodies can be produced in germ-free animals utilizing recent technology (PCT/US90/02545). According to the invention, human antibodies may be used and can be obtained by using human hybridomas (Cote et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:2026-2030) or by transforming human B cells with EBV virus in vitro (Cole et al., 1985, in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, pp. 77-96). In fact, according to the invention, techniques developed for the production of "chimeric antibodies" (Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:6851-6855; Neuberger et al., 1984, Nahire 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, Nature 314:452-454) by sphcing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule specific for a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, derivatives, analogs or fragments thereof together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used; such antibodies are within the scope of this invention.<br>
According to the invention, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce specific single chain antibodies. An additional embodiment of the invention utilizes the techniques described for the constmction of Fab expression libraries (Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281) to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, derivatives, analogs or fragments thereof<br>
Antibody fragments which contain the idiotype of the molecule can be generated by knovm techniques. For example, such fragments include but are not limited to: the F(ab')2<br><br>
fragment which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule; the Fab' fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragment, the Fab fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent, and Fv fragments.<br>
In the production of antibodies, screening for the desired antibody can be accomplished by techniques known in the art, e.g. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). For example, to select antibodies which recognize a specific domain of a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV, one may assay generated hybridomas for a product which binds to a fragment of a protein encoded by a mammalian MPV containing such domain.<br>
The antibodies provided by the present invention can be used for detecting MPV and for therapeutic methods for the treatment of infections with MPV.<br>
The specificity and binding affinities of the antibodies generated by the methods of the invention can be tested by any technique known to the skilled artisan. In certain embodiments, the specificity and binding affinities of the antibodies generated by the methods of the invention can be tested as described in sections 5.8.5, 5.8.6, 5.8.7, 5.8.8 or 5.8.9.<br>

This is most useful when said individual comprises a human.<br><br>
specifically when said human is below 5 years of age, since such infants and young children are most likely to be infected by a human MPV as provided herein. Generally, in the acute phase patients will suffer from upper respiratory symptoms predisposing for other respiratory and other diseases. Also lower respiratory illnesses may occur, predisposing for more and other serious conditions. The compositions of the invention can be used for the treatment of immuno-compromised individuals including cancer patients, transplant recipients and the elderly.<br>

In certain embodiments of the invention, the vaccine of the invention comprises mammalian metapneumovirus as defined herein. In certain, more specific embodiments, the mammalian metapneumovirus is a human metapneumovirus.

The invention provides vaccine formulations for the prevention and treatment of infections with PIV, RSV, APV, and/or hMPV. In certain embodiments, the vaccine of the invention comprises recombinant and chimeric viruses of the invention. In certain embodiments, the virus is attenuated.<br><br>
In a specific embodiment, the vaccine comprises APV and the vaccine is used for the prevention and treatment for hMPV infections in humans. Without being bound by theory, because of the high degree of homology of the F protein of .APV with the F protein of hMPV, infection with APV will result in the production of antibodies in the host that will cross-react with hMPV and protect the host from infection with hMPV and related diseases.<br>
In another specific embodiment, the vaccine comprises hMPV and the vaccine is used for the prevention and treatment for APV infection in birds, such as, but not limited to, in turkeys. Without being bound by theory, because of the high degree of homology of the F protein of APV with the F protein of hMPV, infection with hMPV will result in the production of antibodies in the host that will cross-react with APV and protect the host from infection with APV and related diseases.<br>

hi certain preferred embodiments, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by a metapneumovirus and related diseases. More specifically, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by a human metapneumovirus and/or an avian pneumovirus and related diseases. In certain embodiments, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by<br>
(a)	a human metapneumovirus and a respiratory syncytial virus; and/or (b) an avian<br>
pneumovirus and a respiratory syncytial virus.<br>
In certain embodiments, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by (a) a human metapneumovirus and a human parainfluenza virus; and/or<br>
(b)	an avian pneumovirus and a human parainfluenza virus, and related diseases.<br>
In certain embodiments, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by (a) a human metapneumovirus, a respiratory syncytial virus, and a human parainfluenza virus; and/or (b) an avian pneumovirus, a respiratory syncytial virus, and a human parainfluenza virus, and related diseases.<br>

In certain other embodiments, the vaccine formulation of the invention is used to protect against infections by an avian pneumovirus, a respiratory syncytial virus, and a human parainfluenza virus and related diseases.<br>
Due to the high degree of homology among the F proteins of different viral species, for exemplary amino acid sequence comparisons see Figure 9, the vaccine formulations of the invention can be used for protection from viruses different from the one from which the heterologous nucleotide sequence encoding the F protein was derived. In a specific exemplary embodiment, a vaccine formulation contains a virus comprising a heterologous nucleotide sequence derived from an avian pneumovirus type A, and the vaccine formulation is used to protect from infection by avian pneumovirus type A and avian pneumovirus type B.<br>
The invention encompasses vaccine formulations to be administered to humans and animals which are useful to protect against APV, including APV-C and APV-D, hMPV, PIV, influenza, RSV, Sendai virus, mumps, laryngofracheitis virus, simianvirus 5, human papillomavirus, measles, mumps, as well as other viruses and pathogens and related diseases. The invention further encompasses vaccine formulations to be administered to humans and<br><br>

Attenuated viruses generated by the reverse genetics approach can be used in the vaccine and pharmaceutical formulations described herein. Reverse genetics techniques can also be used to engineer additional mutations to other viral genes important for vaccine production — i.e.., the epitopes of useful vaccine strain variants can be engineered into the attenuated virus. Alternatively, completely foreign epitopes, including antigens derived from other viral or non-viral pathogens can be engineered into the attenuated strain. For example, antigens of non-related viruses such as HIV (gpl60, gpl20, gp41) parasite antigens (e.g.., malaria), bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain. Alternatively, epitopes which alter the tropism of the virus in vivo can be engineered into the chimeric attenuated viruses of the invention.<br>
Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in vaccines. Preferably moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably, epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens, or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example, heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include, but are not limited to influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PFVS. In yet another embodiment, heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno-modulating activities. Examples of immuno-modulating proteins include, but are not limited to, cytokines, interferon type 1, gamma interferon, colony stimulating factors, interleukin -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -12, and antagonists of these agents.<br><br>
In addition, heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in vaccines include but are not limited to sequences derived from a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), preferably type 1 or type 2. fri a preferred embodiment, an immunogenic HIV-derived peptide which may be the source of an antigen may be constructed into a chimeric PIV that may then be used to elicit a vertebrate immune response. Such HIV-derived peptides may include, but are not limited to sequences derived from the env gene (i.e., sequences encoding all or part of gpl60, gpl20, and/or gp41), the pol gene (i.e., sequences encoding all or part of reverse transcriptase, endonuclease, protease, and/or integrase), the gag gene (i.e., sequences encoding all or part of p7, p6, p55, pi 7/18, p24/25), tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu, vpr, and/or vpx.<br>
Other heterologous sequences may be derived from hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg); hepatitis A or C virus surface antigens, the glycoproteins of Epstein Barr virus; the glycoproteins of human papillomavims; the glycoproteins of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Sendai virus, simianvirus 5 or mumps virus; the glycoproteins of influenza virus; the glycoproteins of herpesviruses; VPl of poliovirus; antigenic determinants of non-viral pathogens such as bacteria and parasites, to name but a few. In another embodiment, all or portions of immunoglobulin genes may be expressed. For example, variable regions of anti-idiotypic immunoglobulins that mimic such epitopes may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention.<br>
Other heterologous sequences may be derived from tumor antigens, and the resulting chimeric viruses be used to generate an immune response against the tumor cells leading to tumor regression in vivo. These vaccines may be used in combination with other therapeutic regimens, including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, bone marrow transplantation, etc. for the treatment of tumors. In accordance with the present invention, recombinant viruses may be engineered to express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), including but not limited to, human tumor antigens recognized by T cells (Robbins and Kawakami, 1996, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 8:628-636, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), melanocyte lineage proteins, including gplOO, MART-1/MelanA, TRP-1 (gp75), tyrosinase; Tumor-specific widely shared antigens, MAGE-1, MAGE-3, BAGE, GAGE-1, GAGE-1, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V, pi5; Tumor-specific mutated antigens,<br><br>
P-catenin, MUM-1, CDK4; Nonmelanoma antigens for breast, ovarian, cervical and pancreatic carcinoma, HER-2/neu, human papillomavirus -E6, -E7, MUC-1.<br>
In even other embodiments, a heterologous nucleotide sequence is derived from a metapneumovirus, such as human metapneumovirus and/or avian pneumovirus. hi even other embodiments, the virus of the invention contains two different heterologous nucleotide sequences wherein one is derived from a metapneumovirus, such as human metapneumovirus and/or avian pneumovirus, and the other one is derived from a respiratory syncytial virus. The heterologous nucleotide sequence encodes a F protein or a G protein of the respective virus, hi a specific embodiment, a heterologous nucleotide sequences encodes a chimeric F protein, wherein the chimeric F protein contains the ectodomain of a F protein of a metapneumovirus and the transmembrane domain as well as the luminal domain of a F protein of a parainfluenza virus.<br>
Either a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine can be formulated. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections, and therefore, confers substantial, long-lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.<br>
hi a specific embodiment, the recombinant virus is non-pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard, the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may desire the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations (e.g., deletions) into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example, specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaption can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low.<br>
Alternatively, chimeric viruses with "suicide" characteristics may be constructed. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine, the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle(s) and<br><br>
induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Recombinant viruses lacking one or more of the genes of wild type APV and hMPV, respectively, or possessing mutated genes as compared to the wild type strains would not be able to undergo successive rounds of replication. Defective viruses can be produced in cell lines which permanently express such a gene(s). Viruses lacking an essential gene(s) will be replicated in these cell lines but when administered to the human host will not be able to complete a round of replication. Such preparations may transcribe and translate --in this abortive cycle — a sufficient number of genes to induce an immune response. Alternatively, larger quantities of the strains could be administered, so that these preparations serve as inactivated (killed) virus vaccines. For inactivated vaccines, it is preferred that the heterologous gene product be expressed as a viral component, so that the gene product is associated with the virion. The advantage of such preparations is that they contain native proteins and do not undergo inactivation by treatment with formalin or other agents used in the manufacturing of killed virus vaccines. Alternatively, recombinant virus of the invention made from cDNA may be highly attenuated so that it replicates for only a few rounds.<br>
In certain embodiments, the vaccine of the invention comprises an attenuated mammalian MPV. Without being bound by theory, the attenuated virus can be effective as a vaccine even if the attenuated virus is incapable of causing a cell to generate new infectious viral particles because the viral proteins are inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane of the host thus stimulating an immune response.<br>
In another embodiment of this aspect of the invention, inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to "kill" the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are "dead" in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally, the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines, the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo, purified by zonal ultracentrifiigation, inactivated by formaldehyde or P-propiolactone, and pooled. The resulting vaccine is usually inoculated intramuscularly.<br>
Inactivated viruses may be formulated with a suitable adjuvant in order to enhance the immunological response. Such adjuvants may include but are not limited to mineral gels, e.g., aluminum hydroxide; surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols.<br><br>
polyanions; peptides; oil emulsions; and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG, Corynebacterium parvum, ISCOMS and virosomes.<br>
Many methods may be used to introduce the vaccine formulations described above, these include but are not limited to oral, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, percutaneous, and intranasal and inhalation routes. It may be preferable to introduce the chimeric virus vaccine formulation via the natural route of infection of the pathogen for which the vaccine is designed.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention relates to immunogenic compositions. The immunogenic compositions comprise a mammalian MPV. In a specific embodiment, the immunogenic composition comprises a human MPV. In certain embodiments, the immunogenic composition comprises an attenuated mammalian MPV or an attenuated human MPV. In certain embodiments, the immunogenic composition further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>

In another embodiment, the invention relates to the detection of an MPV infection in an animal or human host through the preparation and use of antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), that are specific to and can recognize peptides or nucleic acids that are characteristic of MPV or its gene products. The epitopes or antigenic determinants recognized by said MAbs include but are not limited to proteinaceous and nucleic acid products that are synthesized during the life cycle and metabolic processes involved in MPV propagation.

Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) and non-limiting examples of immunoassays are described in section 5.8.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to the detection of an MPV infection using oligonucleotides in conjunction with PCR or primer extension methods to copy or ampUfy regions of the MPV genome, said regions including but not limited to genes or parts of genes, e.g., the N, M, F, G, L, M, P, and M2 genes. In a specific embodiment, oHgonucleotides are used in conjunction with RT-PCR methods. In a further embodiment, the amplification products and/or genetic material can be probed with oligonucleotides that are comphmentary to specific sequences that are either conserved between various hMPV strains or are distinct amongst various hMPV strains. The latter set of ohgonucletides would allow for identification of the specific strain of hMPV responsible for the infection of the host.<br>
The invention provides methods for distinguishing between different subgroups and variants of hMPV that are capable of infecting a host. In one specific embodiment, the hMPV that is responsible for a host infection is classified into a specific subgroup, e.g., subgroup A or subgroup B. In another specific embodiment, the hMPV that is responsible for a host infection is classified as a specific variant of a subgroup, e.g., variant Al, A2, Bl, or B2. In another embodiment, the invention provides means and methods for the classification of an hMPV that is responsible for a host infection into a new subgroup and/or into a new variant of a new or existing subgroup. The methods that are able to distinguish hMPV strains into subgroups and/or variant groups would be known to one skilled in the art. In one<br><br>
embodiment, a polyclonal antibody is used to identify the etiological agent of an infection as a strain of hMPV, and a secondary antibody is used to distinguish said strain as characteristic of a new or known subgroup and/or new or known variant of hMPV. In one embodiment, antibodies that are selective for hMPV are used in conjunction with immunoreactive assays, e.g. ELISA or RIA, to identify the presence of hMPV exposure or infection in biological samples. In a further embodiment, secondary antibodies that are selective for specific epitopes in the peptide sequence of hMPV proteins are used to further classify the etiological agents of said identified hMPV infections into subgroups or variants. In one specific embodiment, an antibody raised against peptide epitopes that are shared between all subgroups of hMPV is used to identify the etioligical agent of an infection as an hMPV. In a further specific embodiment, antibodies raised against peptide epitopes that are unique to the different subgroups and/or variants of hMPV are used to classify the hMPV that is responsible for the host infection into a known or new subgroup and/or variant. In one specific embodiment, the antibody that is capable of distinguishing between different subgroups and/or variants of hMPV recognizes segments of hMPV peptides that are unique to the subgroup or variant, said peptides including but not limited to those encoded by the N, M, F, G, L, M, P, and M2 genes. The peptides or segments of peptides that can be used to generate antibodies capable of distinghishing between different hMPV sugroups or variants can be selected using differences in known peptide sequences of various hMPV proteins in conjimction with hydrophillicity plots to identify suitable peptide segments that would be expected to be solvent exposed or accessible in a diagnostic assay. In one embodiment, the antibody that is capable of distinguishing between the different subgroups of hMPV recongnizes differences in the F protein that are unique to different subgroups of hMPV, e.g. the amino acids at positions 286, 296, 312, 348, and 404 of the full length F protein. In another specific embodiment, the antibody that is capable of distinguishing between different subgroups and/or variants of hMPV recognizes segments of the G protein of hMPV that are unique to specific subgroups or variants, e.g., the G peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 50 through 60 of SEQ ID: 119 can be used to distinguish between subgroups A and B as well as between variants Al, A2, Bl, and B2. In another embodiment of the invention, the nucleotide sequence of hMPV isolates are used to distinguish between different subgroups and/or different variants of hMPV. In one embodiment, oligonucleotide sequences, primers, and/or probes that are complimentary<br><br>
to sequences in the hMPV genome are used to classify the etiological agents of hMPV infections into distinct subgroups and/or variants in conjunction with methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g. RT-PCR, PCR, primer run on assays, and various blotting techniques, hi one specific embodiment, a biological sample is used to copy or amplify a specific segment of the hMPV genome, using RT-PCR. hi a further embodiment, the sequence of said segment is obtained and compared with known sequences of liMPV, and said comparison is used to classify the hMPV strain into a distinct subgroup or variant or to classify the hMPV strain into a new subgroup or variant, hi another embodiment, the invention relates to diagnostic kits that can be used to distinguish between different subgroups and/or variants of hMPV.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, diagnosis and/or treatment of a specific viral infection is performed with reagents that are most specific for said specific virus causing said infection, hi this case this means that it is preferred that said diagnosis and/or treatment of an MPV infection is performed with reagents that are most specific for MPV. This by no means however excludes the possibility that less specific, but sufficiently crossreactive reagents are used instead, for example because they are more easily available and sufficiently address the task at hand. Herein it is for example provided to perform virological and/or serological diagnosis of MPV infections in mammals with reagents derived from APV, in particular with reagents derived from APV-C, in the detailed description herein it is for example shown that sufficiently trustworthy serological diagnosis of MPV infections in mammals can be achieved by using an ELISA specifically designed to detect APV antibodies in birds. A particular useful test for this purpose is an ELISA test designed for the detection of APV antibodies (e.g in serum or egg yolk), one commercially available version of which is known as APV-Ab SVANOVIR ® which is manufactured by SVANOVA Biotech AB, Uppsal Science Park Glunten SE-751 83 Uppsala Sweden. The reverse situation is also the case, herein it is for example provided to perform virological and/or serological diagnosis of APV infections in mammals with reagents derived from MPV, in the detailed description herein it is for example shown that sufficiently trustworthy serological diagnosis of APV infections in birds can be achieved by using an ELISA designed to detect MPV antibodies. Considering that antigens and antibodies have a lock-and-key relationship, detection of the various antigens can be achieved by selecting the appropriate antibody having sufficient cross-reactivity. Of course, for relying on such cross-reactivity, it is best to select the reagents (such as antigens or<br><br>
antibodies) under guidance of the amino acid homologies that exist between the various (glyco)proteins of the various viruses, whereby reagents relating to the most homologous proteins will be most useful to be used in tests relying on said cross-reactivity.<br>
For nucleic acid detection, it is even more straightforward, instead of designing primers or probes based on heterologous nucleic acid sequences of the various viruses and thus that detect differences between the essentially mammalian or avian Metapneunioviruses, it suffices to design or select primers or probes based on those stretches of virus-specific nucleic acid sequences that show high homology. In general, for nucleic acid sequences, homology percentages of 90% or higher guarantee sufficient cross-reactivity to be relied upon in diagnostic tests utilizing stringent conditions of hybridisation.<br>
The invention for example provides a method for virologically diagnosing a MPV infection of an animal, in particular of a mammal, more in particular of a human being, comprising determining in a sample of said animal the presence of a viral isolate or component thereof by reacting said sample with a MPV specific nucleic acid a or antibody according to the invention, and a method for serologically diagnosing an MPV infection of a mammal comprising determining in a sample of said mammal the presence of an antibody specifically directed against an MPV or component thereof by reacting said sample with a MPV-specific proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof or an antigen according to the invention. The invention also provides a diagnostic kit for diagnosing an MPV infection conrising an MPV, an MPV-specific nucleic acid, proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof, antigen and/or an antibody according to the invention, and preferably a means for detecting said MPV, MPV-specific nucleic acid, proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof, antigen and/or an antibody, said means for example comprising an excitable group such as a fluorophore or enzymatic detection system used in the art (examples of suitable diagnostic kit format comprise IF, ELISA, neutralization assay, RT-PCR assay). To determine whether an as yet unidentified virus component or synthetic analogue thereof such as nucleic acid, proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof can be identified as MPV-specific, it suffices to analyse the nucleic acid or amino acid sequence of said component, for example for a stretch of said nucleic acid or amino acid, preferably of at least 10, more preferably at least 25, more preferably at least 40 nucleotides or amino acids (respectively), by sequence homology comparison with known MPV sequences and with known non-MPV sequences APV-C is<br><br>
preferably used) using for example phylogenetic analyses as provided herein. Depending on the degree of relationship with said MPV or non-MPV sequences, the component or synthetic analogue can be identified.<br>
The invention also provides method for virologically diagnosing an MPV infection of a mammal comprising determining in a sample of said mammal the presence of a viral isolate or component thereof by reacting said sample with a cross-reactive nucleic acid derived from APV (preferably serotype C) or a cross-reactive antibody reactive with said APV, and a method for serologically diagnosing an MPV infection of a mammal comprising determining in a sample of said mammal the presence of a cross-reactive antibody that is also directed against an APV or component thereof by reacting said sample with a proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof or an antigen derived from APV. Furthermore, the invention provides the use of a diagnostic kit initially designed for AVP or AVP-antibody detection for diagnosing an MPV infection, in particular for detecting said MPV infection in humans.<br>
The invention also provides methods for virologically diagnosing an APV infection in a bird comprising determining in a sample of said bird the presence of a viral isolate or component thereof by reacting said sample with a cross-reactive nucleic acid derived from MPV or a cross-reactive antibody reactive with said MPV, and a method for serologically diagnosing an APV infection of a bird comprising determining in a sample of said bird the presence of a cross-reactive antibody that is also directed against an MPV or component thereof by reacting said sample with a proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof or an antigen derived from MPV. Furthermore, the invention provides the use of a diagnostic kit initially designed for MPV or MPV-antibody detection for diagnosing an APV infection, in particular for detecting said APV infection in poultry such as a chicken, duck or turkey.<br>
For diagnosis as for treatment, use can be made of the high degree of homology among different mammalian MPVs and between MPV and other viruses, such as, e.g., APV, in particular when circumstances at hand make the use of the more homologous approach less straightforward. Vaccinations that can not wait, such as emergency vaccinations against MPV infections can for example be performed with vaccine preparations derived from APV(preferably type C) isolates when a more homologous MPV vaccine is not available, and, vice versa, vaccinations against APV infections can be contemplated with vaccine preparations derived from MPV. Also, reverse genetic techniques make it possible to generate chimeric<br><br>
APV-MPV virus constructs that are useful as a vaccine, being sufficiently dissimilar to field isolates of each of the respective strains to be attenuated to a desirable level. Similar reverse genetic techniques will make it also possible to generate chimeric paramyxovirus-metapneumovirus constructs, such as RSV-MPV or P13-MPV constructs for us in a vaccine preparation. Such constructs are particularly useful as a combination vaccine to combat respiratory tract illnesses.<br>
Since MPV CPE was virtually indistinguishable from that caused by hRSV or hPIV-l in tMK or other cell cultures, the MPV may have well gone unnoticed until now. tMK (tertiary monkey kidney cells, i.e. MK cells in a third passage in cell culture) are preferably used due to their lower costs in comparison to primary or secondary cultures. The CPE is, as well as with some of the classical Paramyxoviridae, characterized by syncytium formation after which the cells showed rapid internal disruption, followed by detachment of the cells from the monolayer. The cells usually (but not always) displayed CPE after three passages of virus from original material, at day 10 to 14 post inoculation, somewhat later than CPE caused by other viruses such as hRSV or hPIV-l.<br>
As an example, the invention provides a not previously identified paramyxovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken from 28 children suffering from severe RTI. The clinical symptoms of these children were largely similar to those caused by hRSV. Twenty-seven of the patients were children below the age of five years and half of these were between 1 and 12 months old. The other patient was 18 years old. All individuals suffered from upper RTI, with symptoms ranging from cough, myalgia, vomiting and fever to broncheolitis and severe pneumonia. The majority of these patients were hospitalised for one to two weeks.<br>
The virus isolates from these patients had the paramyxovirus morphology in negative contrast electron microscopy but did not react with specific antisera against known human and animal paramyxoviruses. They were all closely related to one another as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) with sera raised against two of the isolates. Sequence analyses of nine of these isolates revealed that the virus is somewhat related to APV. Based on virological data, sequence homology as well as the genomic organisation we propose that the virus is a member of Metapneumovirus genus. Serological surveys showed that this virus is a relatively common pathogen since the seroprevalence in the Netherlands approaches<br><br>
100% of humans by the age of five years. Moreover, the seroprevalence was found to be equally high in sera collected from humans in 1958, indicating this virus has been circulating in the human population for more than 40 years. The identification of this proposed new member of the Metapneumovirus genus now also provides for the development of means and methods for diagnostic assays or test kits and vaccines or serum or antibody compositions for viral respiratory tract infections, and for methods to test or screen for antiviral agents useftil in the treatment of MPV infections.<br>
Methods and means provided herein are particularly useful in a diagnostic kit for diagnosing a MPV infection, be it by virological or serological diagnosis. Such kits or assays may for example comprise a virus, a nucleic acid, a proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof, an antigen and/or an antibody according to the invention. Use of a virus, a nucleic acid, a proteinaceous molecule or fragment thereof, an antigen and/or an antibody according to the invention is also provided for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, for example for the treatment or prevention of MPV infections and/or for the treatment or prevention of respiratory tract illnesses, in particular in humans. Attenuation of the virus can be achieved by established methods developed for this purpose, including but not limited to the use of related viruses of other species, serial passages through laboratory animals or/and tissue/cell cultures, site directed mutagenesis of molecular clones and exchange of genes or gene fragments between related viruses.<br>
