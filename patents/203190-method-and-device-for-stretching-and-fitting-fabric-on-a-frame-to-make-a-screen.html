METHOD AND DEVICE FOR STRETCHING AND FITTING FABRIC ON A FRAME TO MAKE A SCREEN<br>
BALIGA SAILENDRA RABINDRANATH<br>
of 21, Laud Mansion, 1st Floor, M.Karve Road, Mumbai 400 004,<br>
Maharashtra, India, an Indian National<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
ORIGINAL  -1135/MUM/2002- 19/12/2002<br><br>
This invention relates to a method and device for stretching and fitting fabric on a frame to make a screen.<br>
Typically, this invention relates to a device for fixing and stretching a fabric on a frame used for screen printing.<br>
In the prior art, fabric is stretched and fitted on a screen printing frame by securing one corner of the fabric on the side of the frame by nailing. The fabric is then stretched manually to the adjoining corner and nailed securely. The side between these corners is then nailed from end to end. This process is repeated for the remaining two corners. The fabric is then manually stretched between the pair of opposite sides and corners and again nailed. The method used is to hold the fabric manually and stretched as tightly as possible while another person nails it quickly before it slips. The entire fabric across the frame cannot be so stretched at a time and one hand length at a time is stretched and nailed. It is difficult to maintain uniform stretching and there is also a tendency of the fabric to tear at a nail because of the uneven stretching force.<br>
A lot of skill and experience is required to make a screen in the prior art. Once nailed there is no chance to remove any wavy soft line in the screen. The method ideally requires three people to do the job: one person to hold the screen down, one to do the stretching and one to do the nailing. The screens formed in these manual processes are not satisfactory, tearing of fabric often happens as a result of uneven stretching at the time of nailing the last two sides. Since the fabric is expensive the screen maker tends to understretch the fabric resulting in poor quality printing.<br>
2<br><br>
Automatic machines which mount the frame on a platform and stretch the fabric across the frame mechanically with the help of gears and hydraulic or pneumatic devices. These devices are very expensive and it is difficult and uneconomical to make small or odd sized screens.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a manual inexpensive device for making best quality screens and eliminating all the aforesaid disadvantages of the prior art methods.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a device that requires only one person to fit a fabric on a frame to make a screen without damaging the fabric during the stretching or fitting process and which permits a frame to be used again and again.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a device for making a screen printing screen which is cost effective, and economic.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is provide a device which can be dismantled when not is use and stored away in a convenient location.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is that the device is suitable for any size frame and is adjustable to accommodate a variety of frames.<br>
According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a method for stretching and fitting fabric on a frame to make a screen consisting of a arranging and fastening four elongate sections having at least one array of fastening arrangements on the operative outside of the sections around the<br>
3<br><br>
frame in comer clamps , securing the fabric to one portion of the fastening arrangement, spanning the rest of the fabric across the elongate sections above the frame adjustably fitted in the four elongate sections adapted to be aligned around the sides of a frame; raising the frame in the fastened and arranged elongate sections to uniformly tension, stretch and tighten the a fabric secured to the fastening arrangements relative to the sides of the frame, fixing the fabric in the tensioned state to the frame by adhesion or otherwise, removing the frame from the arrangement of elongate sections and cutting of the excess fabric to form the screen.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a device for stretching and fitting fabric on a frame to make a screen consisting of a four elongate sections having at least one array of fastening arrangements on the operative outside of the sections, for securing fabric spanning the elongate sections across a frame adjustably fitted in the four elongate sections adapted to be aligned around the sides of a frame; a set of comer clamps for holding a frame secured within the elongate sections, locking elements provided in the comer clamps for locking the elongate sections around the frame and leveling and raising elements for raising the frame fitted within the elongate section to uniformly stretch and tighten a fabric secured to the fastening arrangements relative to the sides of the frame.<br>
Typically, the fastening arrangement consists of at least one array of nails extending from the operative outer face of the elongate sections.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>

Referring to the drawings,    the following reference numeral indicate the components marked alongside :<br>
A - Channel with nails.<br>

B-Nails<br>
C - Push up strip to push up Printing Frame<br>
D - Top Plate of Corner Clamp<br>
E - Base Plate of Corner Clamp.<br>
F - Nut fixed on Top Plate 'D'<br>
G - Space for one channel to slide through the corner clamp.<br>
H - Space for other channel, which will touch the sliding channel mentioned<br>
in 'G' above<br>
I - Push up Bolt (in slightly open position), pushes up Strip 'C<br>
J - Rivet attaching Push up Bolt to Push up Strip<br>
K - Nut attached to Base Plate of Corner Clamp<br>
L - Bolts when tightened , hold the Channel 'A' mentioned above.<br>
M - Space allowing Channel 'A' to slide, also allowing two channels to<br>
meet side by side, for increasing the length of channels when required for<br>
large frames.<br>
N - Push up Plate for pushing up Printing Frame.<br>
O - Nut attached to Joiner cum Push up mechanism.<br>
P - Push up Bolt, pushes up Plate 'M' mentioned above, when tightened.<br>
Q - Rivet attaching Push up bolt to Push up Plate 'M' mentioned above.<br>
R - Nut/ Bolt mechanism similar to 'FT, T, 'J', and 'K' explained above to<br>
hold Channels within the Joiner cum Push up Clamp.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the device consists of four "L" shaped channels defined by two side walls at right angles to each other designated by reference letter A which has a plurality of nails B extending from the outer surface of one of the side walls and four corner clamps CC consisting of C -Push up strip to push up Printing Frame, D - Top Plate of Corner Clamp E -<br>
6<br><br>
Base Plate of Corner Clamp; F - Nut fixed on Top Plate 'D'; G - Space for one channel A to slide through the corner clamp CC and H - Space for other channel, which will touch the sliding channel A. The nails B are used for holding the screen fabric FB in place [ see figures 4 to 11] The device can accommodate any size printing frame PM as seen in figures 4 to 11.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the method of assembling the device and fixing the frame and the fabric thereto.<br>
As seen in figure 4, the channels A are so arranged that the touch all four sides of the printing frame PM. The four channels are then locked by clamping at four corners using the corner clamps CC. In this position the push up bolt P should be fully open and the push up strip or plate N is fully in contact with the corner clamp. This clamping arrangement can be achieved typically using the clamping arrangement as illustrated in figure 2(a) to figure 3(c). The fabric FB is then fixed at one corner as seen in figure 5 by inserting the fabric in the nails B. The fabric is then stretched and fixed on the opposite comer as seen in figure 6. As seen in figures 7 to 9 stretching the fabric FB from all four sides takes place and also fixing the fabric in the nails B with the help of the brush BR. Thereafter the frame PM which rests on plate N in the corner clamps is pushed up by push up bolt P to stretch the fabric FB against the frame PM until the fabric is stretched to the maximum limit as seen in figure 10. The fabric is then pasted to the frame and the frame is then detached from the channels as seen in figure 11.<br>
