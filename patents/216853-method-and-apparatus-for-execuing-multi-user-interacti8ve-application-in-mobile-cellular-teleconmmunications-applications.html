				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is in the field of mobile cellular telecommunications in<br>
general, and mobile cellular telecommunications infrastructure based multi-user<br>
applications in particular.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In WO98/10604, there is illustrated and described a method and apparatus<br>
for an interactive cell broadcast service employing Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP)<br>
(Short Message Service) SMS messages to subscribers in respect of several<br>
interactive applications including voting, subscribing to different cellular<br>
services, and the like. The subscribers are prompted to respond by depressing a<br>
pushkey for immediately originating either a Point-To-Point (PTP) SMS message<br>
telephone call or a telephone call to an embedded callback number.<br>
In WO99/42964, there is illustrated and described a game system in which<br>
a plurality of subscribers transmit subscriber game data to at least one central<br>
game unit in order to participate in games via SMS messages using mobile<br>
telephone devices in a mobile telephone network. The central game unit carries<br>
out games according to pre-determined rules and transmits central unit game data<br>
to the subscribers" mobile telephone devices via SMS messages through the<br>
mobile telecommunications network.<br>
In WO00/22906, there is illustrated and described a method and system<br>
for performing electronic auctions using SMS messages between a mobile center<br>
in communication with an auction management system and a mobile phone to<br>
give information on products, current prices and accept offers, and from a mobile<br>
phone to a mobile center in order to make conditional purchase offers.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Generally speaking the present invention is directed toward the use of<br>
Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP) display messages over a mobile cellular<br>
telecommunications infrastructure for supporting a number of multi-user<br>
applications including multi-user interactive applications in the case of PTMP<br>
interactive display messages. The term "interactive display message " within the<br>
context of the present invention implies that a subscriber can automatically<br>
activate a Point-to-Point (PTP) transmission response mechanism, for example,<br>
originating a voice call, transmitting an SMS, initiating a WAP session, and the<br>
like, from a dedicated response means integrally provided in a display message.<br>
The display messages to be displayed on subscribers" personal cellular<br>
telecommunications devices may be displayed thereon immediately, displayed in<br>
a screen saver like manner when the personal cellular telecommunications device<br>
is running a screen saver like application as illustrated and described in<br>
Applicant"s co-pending PCT International Application claiming priority from<br>
Israel Patent Application 134,035, or displayed upon retrieval from an input box.<br>
The personal cellular telecommunications devices can include a wide range of<br>
mobile handheld devices including inter alia simple phones, smartphones,<br>
combined PDA/phones, combined MP3 music player/phones, and the like,<br>
employing different Operating Systems (O/Ss) including inter alia Microsoft CE,<br>
EPOC Symbian, Palm O/S, and the like.<br>
One envisaged multi-user application involves a series of question and<br>
answer procedures for staging a consumer survey, a multi-player game, and the<br>
like. The question and answer routines typically terminate in the transmitting of<br>
either a PTP feedback message to only those subscribers who actively<br>
participated or alternatively a PTMP feedback message to all subscribers<br>
Tespective of whether they actively participated or not. Another envisaged<br>
multi-user application is the secure distribution over PTMP of a wide range of<br>
typically high value encoded Content on Demand (CoD) offerings such as multi-<br><br>
media clips, financial information, and the like. In this case, only subscribers<br>
who typically have expressed their interest in the CoD offerings, and are prepared<br>
to pay for them in accordance with a predetermined Schedule of Charges in a<br>
similar manner to Video on Demand (VoD) offerings, for example, per offering,<br>
as part of a subscription to a service, and the like, receive FTP messages<br>
containing the decoding information necessary for the decoding of the encoded<br>
CoD offerings for enabling their display on the subscribers" personal cellular<br>
telecommunications devices. And finally, another envisaged multi-user<br>
application is the staggered broadcast of the same PTMP interactive display<br>
message promoting a product or service over different geographical areas served<br>
by different Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) for load balancing purposes, for<br>
example, at a call center having sales representatives for taking calls from<br>
subscribers who are interested in the product or service.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows a mobile cellular telecommunications network 1 including<br>
a plurality of individually addressable Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) 2 each<br>
providing bidirectional signal coverage to a plurality of subscribers within a<br>
predefined geographical area. The BTSs 2 are each capable of transmitting<br>
Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP) SMS messages to subscribers" personal cellular<br>
telecommunications devices 3 in their respective geographical areas. The BTSs 2<br>
are also each capable of transmitting and receiving Point-To-Point (PTP) SMS<br>
messages to and from subscribers" personal cellular telecommunications devices<br>
3 in their respective geographical areas. The mobile cellular telecommunications<br>
network 1 is connected to a server 4 for supporting one or more multi-user<br>
applications including multi-user interactive applications.<br>
One such multi-user application is a consumer survey application<br>
employing a database 6 having database records 7 (see Figure 2) including the<br>
following fields: An identifier field containing a question number for identifying<br>
a question. A question field containing a question. And, an answer field<br>
containing two or more possible answers to the question in the associated<br>
question field.<br>
Another such multi-user application is a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire<br>
type multi-player game based on questions stored in database records 8 (see<br><br>
Figure 3) similar to those of a consumer survey question but additionally<br>
including the following fields from left to right: An answer field containing four<br>
possible answers to the question. A correct answer field indicating the correct<br>
answer to the question. An additional information field indicating the order of<br>
incorrect answers to be crossed out in the case that a subscriber requests<br>
additional information. And finally, a score field indicating the high score to be<br>
awarded to a subscriber who answers a question correctly without any additional<br>
information, and a low score in the case that he answers a question correctly after<br>
having seen additional information.<br>
The staging of a consumer survey within the geographical area covered by<br>
a single BTS 2 is as follows: The server transmits a PTMP SMS display message<br>
for displaying the question "WHICH US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WOULD<br>
YOU VOTE FOR?" together with the names of the two US presidential<br>
candidates on the personal cellular telecommunications devices of each subscriber<br>
in the selected geographical area (see Figure 5A). Each subscriber wishing to<br>
participate in the consumer survey, proceeds to press the answer pushkey<br>
corresponding to his choice for US president, for example, a subscriber would<br>
press the pushkey "1" to vote for George Bush. On pressing one of the answer<br>
pushkeys, his personal cellular telecommunications device transmits a Point-to-<br>
Point (PTP) SMS response message including the question identifier, and his<br>
answer to the question to the server. The server determines the total number of<br>
subscribers who answered the question within a predetermined interval, say, 2<br>
minutes from its initial broadcast, and determines the breakdown of votes<br>
between the two US presidential candidates. The server transmits a second<br>
PTMP SMS feedback message "THE RESULTS OF THE POLL ARE: GEORGE<br>
BUSH 6,707, AL GORE 6,678 TOTAL 13,385" for display on the personal<br>
cellular telecommunications devices of all the subscribers in the selected<br>
geographical area (see Figure 5B).<br>
The staging of a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire type multi-player game<br><br>
one or more steps. In the simplest implementation involving the same three steps<br>
as the staging of a consumer survey, the last step would typically include<br>
displaying the feedback message: "THE CORRECT ANSWER IS THOMAS<br>
EDISON. 12,153 OUT OF 17,167 SUBSCRIBERS ANSWERED CORRECTLY".<br>
A more sophisticated implementation may include providing additional<br>
information in the form of incorrect answers being scored out to help a subscriber<br>
to answer a question correctly. The additional information can be shown either in<br>
response to a subscriber asking for additional information, or automatically after a<br>
predetermined amount of time. Also, in the case of an incorrect answer, a<br>
subscriber may be prompted as to whether he wants additional information to be<br>
shown, if he wants to answer the question again, and the like. These optional<br>
steps can be executed by the server or alternatively by client applications running<br>
on subscribers" personal cellular telecommunications devices themselves.<br>
Subscribers can subscribe to a service providing Content on Demand<br>
(CoD) offerings, for example, up-to-date financial news, say, on the hour every<br>
hour. Such subscribers typically receive a FTP decoding information message,<br>
say, everyday at 00:00, containing the decoding information for decoding the<br>
CoD offerings of that service which they will receive on a regular basis for as<br>
long as they keep up their subscription to the service (see Figure 6A). In this<br>
manner, the encoded content is immediately decoded on its receipt at a<br>
subscriber"s personal cellular telecommunications device/ Against this, in the<br>
case of a CoD application being charged on a pay-as-you-go basis, the PTP<br>
decoding information message is only sent pursuant to a subscriber expressing his<br>
interest in viewing an encoded COD offering promoted in a PTMP interactive<br>
display message transmitted preferably after the encoded CoD offering such that<br>
the response time until a subscriber can view the CoD offering is minimized (see<br>
Figure 6B). Exemplary CoD offerings on a pay-as-you-go basis could include<br>
multi-media news items, goal replays at football matches, and the like,<br>
depending on several factors including the sensitivity of the CoD offerings, their<br><br>
frequency, their size, and the like, the CoD offerings can be either merely<br>
scrambled or fully encrypted, for example, using the standard 56-DES algorithm.<br>
Figure 7 shows the use of the mobile cellular telecommunications network<br>
1 for the staggered broadcast of the same PTMP interactive display message at a<br>
different BTS 2A, ..., 2E, and 2F each covering a different area at 20 minute<br>
intervals starting at 21:00. Assuming that the interactive display message<br>
includes an embedded callback number to a call center 9 having sales<br>
representatives for taking calls from subscribers interested in hearing more details<br>
about the mortgages, the calls arriving at the call center 9 would be spread over<br>
more time than if the interactive display message would be broadcasted at ail the<br>
BTSs 2A,... 2E, and 2F simultaneously.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number<br>
