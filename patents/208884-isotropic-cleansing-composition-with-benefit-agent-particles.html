ISOTROPIC CLEANSING COMPOSITION WITH BENEFIT AGENT PARTICLES<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>

ISOTROPIC CLEANSING COMPOSITION WITH BENEFIT AGENT PARTICLES<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions suitable for topical application for cleansing the human   body, such as the skin and hair. In particular, it relates to isotropic compositions containing benefit agent particles.<br>
In order to be acceptable to consumers, a liquid personal   cleansing product must exhibit good cleaning properties,<br>
must exhibit good lathering characteristics, must be mild to the skin (not cause drying or irritation) and preferably should even provide a benefit agent to the skin, such as moisturizers, anti-wrinkle agents, skin nutrients, and the 5  like.<br>
. Several approaches have been used to provide high levels of benefit agents in a stable formula that have involved encapsulating the benefit agent which is then ruptured or<br>
20  dissolved with product use.  For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,932,528 to R. Glenn, Jr., et al. issued on Aug. 3, 1999 discloses a liquid cleansing composition containing a moisturizing phase comprising an encapsulated lipophilic skin moisturizing agent and an aqueous cleansing phase<br>
25  comprising a surfactant and a stabilizer.  The encapsulated lipophilic skin moisturizing agent comprises a lipophilic skin moisturizing agent encapsulated within a complex coascervate comprising a polycation and a polyanion.<br>
30  Other particles of material including microcapsules, bubbles, beads, ground particulates, and uniform<br><br><br>
particulates have been used in various cleansing and coating applications to encapsulate or bind the contents of various agents contained therein or associated therewith.  For example U.S. Patent No. 6,270,836 to Holman issued on August    7, 2001 describes microcapsules coated with a gel,<br>
specifically a gel produced by the sol-gel process.  The gel coating provides certain resistances to the microcapsules,    resulting in enhanced protection for their contents.<br>
Microcapsules containing different types of materials are 20  known which may be used as ingredients in the compositions of this invention, such as gelatin.<br>
It is known that microcapsules may be formed by a coacervation or crosslinking process, in which lipids are<br>
25  coated by tiny droplets of proteins, carbohydrates, or synthetic polymers suspended in water.  The process of Goacervation is however, difficult to control and depends on variables such as temperature, pH, agitation of the materials, and the inherent variability introduced by a<br>
2 0  natural protein or carbohydrate.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,066,613 to L. Tsaur, et al., issued on May 23, 2000; describes large hydrogel particles suspended in an aqueous medium and a continuous extrusion/mixing process for<br>
25  making this kind of hydrogel particles.  The hydrogel particles comprise two different high molecular weight polymers. One is insoluble in the said aqueous medium and is<br>
used for network forma-tion and ge-1 integrity.The other is<br>
soluble in the said aqueous medium and helps control gel<br>
30  swellability and gel strength.  Water insoluble materials are entrapped or encapsulated inside the network formed by<br><br><br>
these two polymers and are able to be more efficiently delivered from the aqueous composition (e.g., liquid cleanser containing the hydrogel particles).<br>
3  However there is no; disclosure or suggestion in the prior art of a isotropic cleansing composition containing organogel particles wherein the particles are formed by associating benefit agents that are liquids at about 75°C with a gelation agent that is a solid at about 25°C, and 10  wherein said. isotropic phase composition has a viscosity of about 1,000 to about 300,000 cps at 2 5°C.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention there is provided an isotropic cleansing composition containing (a) a surfactant<br>
15     selected from an anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof; (b) a thickening agent; (c) about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of organogel particles of from about 0.05 to about 10 millimeters in diameter, the particle comprising a benefit agent that is a liquid at<br>
20  about 75°C and a gelation agent that is a solid at about<br>
25°C, the proportions of the gelation agent to benefit agent being between about 0.05% to about 70% by weight gelation agent to benefit agent, the solidification or gelation temperature of the mixture being at or above about 25°C, and<br>
25  (d) wherein the viscosity of the cleansing composition as measured without the organogel particles is in the range of about 1,000 to about 300,000 cps at 1/sec shear rate at 25°C.<br>
In another aspect of the invention is a method of depositing 30  a benefit' agent from an isotropic liquid cleansing composition, comprising the steps of:<br><br><br><br>
(a) providing said benefit agent in said cleansing<br>
composition including: (1) a surfactant selected<br>
from anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and cationic<br>
5	surfactants, and mixtures thereof; (2) a thickening<br>
agent, and (3) about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of<br>
organogel particles of from about 0.05 to about 10<br>
millimeters in diameter, the particles comprising<br>
the benefit agent that is a liquid at about 75°C and<br>
l0	a gelation agent that is a solid at about 25°C, the<br>
proportions of the gelation agent to benefit agent being between about 0.05% to about 70% by weight gelation agent to benefit agent, the solidification or gelation temperature of the mixture being at or above about 25°C; and<br>
 (b) applying said cleansing composition to the -skin or hair.<br>
20  In another aspect of the invention is a method for preparing a composition containing (a) a surfactant selected from an anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof; (b) a thickening agent; (c) about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of organogel particles of from about<br>
25  0.05 to about 10 millimeters in diameter, the particle<br>
comprising a benefit agent that is a liquid at about 75°C and a gelation agent that is a solid at about 25°C, the<br>
   proportions  of the gelation agent to,benefit agent being<br>
between about 0.05% to about 70% by weight gelation agent to<br>
30  benefit agent, the solidification or gelation temperature of the mixture being at or above about 25°C, (d) wherein the<br><br>
viscosity of the cleansing composition as measured without the particles is in the range of about 1,000 to about 300,000 cps at 1/sec shear rate at 25°C, and (e) a free emollient having a weight average particle size in the range 5  of about 1 to about 500 microns, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	forming a first composition having at least one<br>
surfactant selected from anionic, nonionic,<br>
amphoteric, and cationic surfactants and mixtures<br>
10	thereof;<br>
(b)	adding a thickening agent to the free emollient in an amount from 1 to 50 wt.%, based on the free emollient; and<br>
(c)	mixing the base formulation of step (a) with the free emollient of step (b);<br>
(d)	adding to the first composition, the thickening agent or a blend thereof about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of organogel particles of from about 0.05 to about 10 millimeters in diameter, the particles comprising a benefit agent that is a liquid at about 75°C and a gelation agent that is a solid at about<br>
2 5	25°C, the proportions of the gelation agent to<br>
benefit agent being between about 0.05% to about 70% by weight gelation agent to benefit agent, the solidification or gelation temperature of the mixture being at or above about 25°C.<br><br>
A free emollient is herein defined as an emollient not bound to the organogel particles.  Free emollient particles are also separate and distinct from organogel particles.<br>
Organogel particles suitable for the inventive cleansing composition comprise a hydrophobic (oleophilic) phase in particulate form, with no need for a rigid shell to encapsulate the phase, and usually with no shell present. The particle's oleophilic phase contains a gelation agent, 10  and preferably an organogelation agent.  Such particles have prolonged stability and can be simply manufactured.<br>
A preferred method of manufacture of the particles comprises forming a solution of at least the oleophilic material and gelation agent at a temperature above their gelation temperature, forming droplets of the solutions, and cooling the droplets to form particulates.  Cooling may be effected by exposure to ambient conditions (e.g., room temperature) when the ingredients are appropriately selected with regard to their melting points, or an actual cooling environment may be needed to form the particles.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the following definitions are used.<br><br>
"Gel" means a mixture of a solvent and solid material network (such as a solid network of particle network, fibroid network, reticulated network, and the like) wherein the solid material (e.g., any solid such as a waxy material, polymeric material, sintered or fused particle material, or any other solid material that forms a physically supportive<br><br>
network for the other component) is formed through physical aggregation of the solid material through any associative means.  Generally, a gel is more viscous than a liquid or paste, and retains its shape when left undisturbed, i.e., it is self-supporting.  However, a gel is typically not as hard or firm as a wax.  Gels may be penetrated more easily than a wax-like solid, where "hard" gels are relatively more resistant to penetration than "soft" gels.  A rigid gel as defined herein resists deformation upon the application of a force.<br>
"Hydrogel" means a gel in which the solvent (diluent) is water or aqueous based liquids.<br>
"Organogel" means a gel in which the solvent (diluent) is an organic carrier or organic solvent (as opposed to water or aqueous based liquids) .<br>
"Thermoreversible organogel" is synonymous with "physical organogel" and means an organogel whose network structure is due to weak, thermally unstable bonding such as hydrogen bonding (as opposed to strong, thermally stable bonds such as covalent bonds) and can, therefore, be heated to a free-flowing, liquid (molten) state. Upon cooling below a<br>
characteristic temperature (Tgel), the bonds reform and the<br>
solid-like gel structure is re-established.<br>
Tge1 means a temperature at which, by a-ny physical<br>
phenomenon, a mixture of ingredients (e.g., of an oil and organic material mixed therewith) in discrete form (e.g.,<br><br>
particulate, droplet, drop, pastille, particle, thread, fibroid, etc.) passes from a flowable or liquid condition into a stable gel or semi-solid state.  Usually this occurs by solidification of gelling or organization of a liquid material into a more solid form, adding structure to the discrete form.<br>

The inventive cleansing compositions possesses isotropic micellar phase microstructure.  The rheological behavior of all surfactant solutions, including liquid cleansing solutions, is strongly dependent on the microstructure, i.e., the shape and concentration of micelles or other self-assembled structures in solution.<br><br>
When there is sufficient surfactant to form micelles (concentrations above the critical micelle concentration or CMC), for example, spherical, cylindrical (rod-like or discoidal), spherocylindrical, or ellipsoidal micelles may form.  As surfactant concentration increases, ordered liquid crystalline phases such as lamellar phase, hexagonal phase, cubic phase or L3 sponge phase may form.  The non-isotropic   hexagonal phase, consists of long cylindrical micelles arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  In general, the microstructure of most personal care products consist of either an isotropic dispersion including spherical micelles, and rod micelles, or an ordered liquid crystalline-phase-such as a lamellar dispersion.<br>
As noted above, micelles may be spherical or rod-like. Formulations having spherical micelles tend to have a low viscosity and exhibit Newtonian shear behavior (i.e., the   viscosity stays constant as a function of shear rate) ; thus, if easy pouring of product is desired, the solution is less viscous.  In these systems, the viscosity increases linearly with surfactant concentration.<br>
0  Rod micellar solutions are more viscous because movement of the longer micelles is restricted.  At a critical shear<br><br>
rate, the micelles align and the solution becomes shear thinning.  Addition of salts increases the size of the rod micelles thereof increasing zero shear viscosity (i.e., viscosity when sitting in bottle) which helps suspend particles, but also increases critical shear rate (i.e. the point at which the product becomes shear thinning; higher critical shear rates means that the product is more difficult to pour).<br><br><br>
         Lamellar dispersions differ from both spherical and rod-like micelles because they can have high zero shear viscosity (because of the close packed arrangement of constituent lamellar droplets), yet these solutions are very shear thinning (readily dispense on pouring).  That is, the solutions can become thinner than rod micellar solutions at moderate shear rates.<br>
In- formulating liquid cleansing compositions, therefore, there is the choice of using isotropic micellar phases such as rod-micellar solutions; or lamellar dispersions.  When rod-micellar solutions are used, they also often require the use of external structurants to enhance viscosity and to suspend particles.  For this, carbomers and clays are often used.  At higher shear rates (as in product dispensing, 25  application of product to body, or rubbing with hands) ,<br>
since the rod-micellar solutions are less shear thinning, the viscosity of the solution stays high and the product can be stringy and thick.<br>
30  One way of characterizing isotropic micellar dispersions (hereinafter "isotropic compositions") include cone and<br><br><br><br>
plate viscosity measurement as described below.  The inventive isotropic composition absent the organogel particles has a viscosity in the range of about 1,000 to about 300,000 cps at 1/sec shear rate at 25°C as measured by a cone and plate technique described below.  Preferably the viscosity is in the range of about 5,000 to 50,000 cps.<br>
A stable organogel particle suitable for the inventive composition of from 0.05 to 2, 5 or 10 millimeters in diameter comprises a mixture of a material that is an oleophilic liquid at 25°C, 50°C, or 75°C and a gelation agent or organogelation agent, the proportions of the gelation agent to oleophilic liquid being between 0.05% to 70%, or 0.05% to 50%, or 0.05% to 30% by weight gelation agent to<br>
15  oleophilic liquid, the Tgel of the mixture being above 25°C.<br>
The gelation agent may comprise an organogelation agent, which is a term understood in the art and further defined herein.  The particle may provide the oleophilic material liquid (or solid) as an oil, oil mixture, oil dispersion or suspension, or oil solution.<br>
A group of particles may have an average diameter of between 0.05 to 10 millimeters, between 0.08 and 10 millimeters, between 0.08 and 5 millimeters, between 0.1 and 5 25      millimeters, between 0.1 and 2 millimeters, and 0.1 and 1 millimeters and the proportions of the gelation agent to oleophilic liquid may be, for example, between 0.5% to 20% or more by weight gelation agent to oleophilic liquid.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The Tgel of the mixture or the Tgel of the individual<br>
components forming the organogel particle refers to the temperature at which the composition gels from an essentially liquid state as the temperature drops, or the temperature at which an individual component gels when the temperature of a liquid component is dropped.<br><br>
A preferred method of forming such a stable organogel particle may include:<br><br>
a)	mixing together at least the oleophilic liquid and<br>
the gelation agent,<br>
b)	providing the mixture as a fluid material (having<br>
liquid or flowable properties), the mixture being at<br>
a temperature at least 5°C above the solidifying<br>
	temperature, such as at least 5°C above the Tgel of<br>
the mixture and/or the gelation agent;<br>
c)	forming discrete elements, such as droplets,<br>
pastilles, strands, particles, shapes, or other solid<br>
accumulations or gels of the material (preferably a<br>
	fluid material); and<br>
d)	cooling the solid accumulation (e.g., droplets,<br>
strands, particles, shapes, etc.) to a temperature at<br>
or at least 5°C below the solidification temperature<br>
of the gelation agent of the Tgel of the mixture or<br>
gelation agent or at any other temperature that causes gelation to form solid, relatively stable particles.<br>
Organogel particle hardness is an important parameter in       formulating an acceptable cleansing composition.  Typically<br><br><br><br><br><br>
the hardness is advantageously adjusted to be satisfactory to the user and can be defined as the Particle Breakage Index (PBI) or the amount of force (weight) required to break or rupture the particle.  PBI is conveniently expressed in terms of grams per square millimeter, and is calculated based on the following equation:<br>
PBI = weight need to break a particle (g)/cross section area of particle (mm2)<br>
Preferably, the particles should have a PBI value of about 0.05 up to 10, more preferably about 0.5 to about 5 and most preferably about 1.5 to 3.0.  Such properties correspond to what the average user of the inventive cleansing composition considers as highly acceptable hardness for the particles. The strength can be controlled by the exercise of reasonable judgment and selection of ingredients and proportions according to art recognized techniques.  Viscosity agents, thixotropic agents, surfactants, solid binders, antistatic agents, crosslinking agents, coupling agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, thinning agents, and the like are among the types of additives that can be added in amounts between 0.001 and 30% by weight of the hydrophobic (oleophilic) material (e.g., the oil) to assist in the control of the properties of the organogel particles, such as size, physical strength, durability, and the like.<br><br>
 With respect to particle gel rheology, typically,  gels<br>
possess a storage modulus G'(w) which exhibits a pronounced   plateau at higher frequencies (on the order of 1-100 radians/second), and a loss modulus G"(w) which is<br><br><br><br><br>
considerably smaller than the storage modulus in the plateau region.  In a strict sense, the term "gel" applies to systems having a value G'(w) that is higher than its value of G" (w) at low frequencies.  Many of the compositions   according to the present invention are gels by one or both of the above definitions.  A gel is free-standing or self-supporting, in that its yield value is greater than the shear stress imposed by gravity.<br>
  Rheological parameters such as the storage modulus G'(w) can be measured as a function of angular frequency with a parallel-plate rheometer.  For example, such parameters can be generated using a Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer Model 70, using a 0.5 cm stainless steel plate and a 2.3 mm sample<br>
  gap, over a temperature sweep of 25-85°C at 1% strain and 6. radians/sec.  Characterization of the rheological behavior of a gelled body according to the present invention can be made using the Rheometrics instrument and conditions set forth above.  As the gel is heated, it retains significant<br>
   gel-like character until its Tgel temperature is reached. The viscosity of the particles at room temperature may typically vary from 10 to a few thousand cP or higher, even to the point of approaching properties that appear more solid than gel like.<br><br>
Another property that may be directly measured is shear viscosity at e.g. 0.1 rad/sec as measured by ASTM D 2765-Procedure A.  The shear viscosity, for example, may-range from at least about 5 percent higher compared with the oil<br>
 at room temperature to orders of magnitude higher than the<br><br><br><br>
shear viscosity at room temperature of the oils as measured by ASTM D 2765-Procedure A.<br>
The precise process and phenomena that contribute to the 5  formation of the particles, and the precise structure of the particles may vary between different combinations of materials, and even between different proportions of the same materials.  It is believed that at least one of the following three systems and processes occur during the practice of the present invention, although these descriptions and/or hypothesis are not intended to be limiting on the scope of actual processes and structures that are provided in the practice of the present invention.<br>
l5  The first method is where the two organic materials (the oleophilic agent and the gelation agent) are provided as a mixture at a temperature at which both materials are together as a fluid (e.g., preferably as a true liquid, but at least in a form that is flowable and in which the at least two ingredients are intimately mixed).  This temperature usually requires that the softening temperature<br>
and/or the flow temperature or melt temperature (e.g., Tgel<br>
and/or Tgel) be exceeded.  After the fluid and the intermixed<br>
components have been provided at this elevated temperature (e.g., at a temperature above 25°C, above 40 °C, above 50 °C, above 60 °C, above 75 °C, above 85 °C, above 100 °C, above 120  °C,above 150 °C, above 175 °C, and the like, up to<br>
temperatures short of where the individual components boil or decompose), the composition is cooled.<br><br>
The cooling temperature, depending upon how low a temperature to which the mixture is dropped, will cause at least one or both of the at least two ingredients to solidify.  This cooling is done while the mixture is in or being placed into particulate form, as by prilling, pastilling, spray drying (or spray cooling in this case), or any other particle forming process.  Because the at least two materials are intermixed, as opposed to the encapsulating relationship found in prior art microencapsulation processes, as the first or both at least two materials (the oleophilic agent and the gelation agent) harden or solidify, they remain intermixed.<br>
It is particularly at this point that the nature of the particle forming phenomenon becomes alternative in nature. The gelation agent, in some circumstances is believed to form fibroids, tendrils, fibers, reticulated structures, aspherical shapes, elongate elements or the like (e.g., with aspect ratios of at least 3, aspect ratios of at least 4 or 5, and higher, up to continuous filamentary elements with extremely high aspect ratios) within the particle material (e.g., within a droplet).  These various structural elements form a physical support for the oleophilic material, whether supporting the oleophilic material by surface tension to the solid, adsorption to the solid, partial entrapment by the solid, entrapment by the solid, partial absorption by the solid, or by any other physical or physical chemical means by which the solid material supports and maintains a particulate shape for the at least two materials.<br><br><br>
A second method of stable particle, or droplet formation may occur where the structural elements may even be particulates without elongate structure (e.g., aspect ratios between 1 and 3, or between 1 and 5), wherein the physical forces between the particles and the oleophilic agent sustains the particle, or droplet structure.  The particles may or may not be in contact with each other and may or may not be bound by physical or chemical means to each other during the gelation or solidifying process, but they do provide actual support for the particle, or droplet structure so that the product exists as a stable particle.<br>
A third method by which particle stabilization or gelation may occur is with the formation of a gradation of materials within the particle, with the highest concentration of the gelation agent at the surface of the droplet and the least concentration of the gelation agent (yet still above 0.0) occurring at center of the particle.  This is not traditional encapsulation or microencapsulation, where there is a clear distinction and sharp separation between a shell (solid) and a core (liquid).  The gradation may have the outermost surface of the particle as 100% gelation material (and entrapped solids or intended diluents or active ingredients), but may also have 99%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 75%, 50%, 40%, 35% 30% or the like of gelation agent in the outermost surface and lower amounts within the body of the particle, the remainder of the concentration being provided as the oleophilic material and its associated components.<br>
As noted above and later herein, a preferred aspect of the invention uses a gelation agent that is a solid at 25°C to<br><br><br>
stabilize an oleophilic fluid, flowable or liquid material. The oleophilic material may also be a solid or difficult to flow material at 25°C, so that the particle may even be a solid oleophilic material in a solid matrix or network of solid supporting elements or gelation agent.  The solid network of gelation agent may have provided structural support for the oleophilic material during the solidification process, and remains as a network after the cooling of the oleophilic material to a solid.  The final     stable particle may therefore be a support system of the<br>
gelation agent and a liquid or semisolid or solid oleophilic material in particle form.  It must be noted, again, that the term particle generically refers to a bead, pastille, solid droplet, fibroid, sphere, oblong, filamentary object,     reticulated network, or other solid form with the required<br>
maximum diameter of 10 mm or less. The average diameter may be based upon number average diameter, or any other basis as desired.<br>
         According to the present invention, molten (liquid) organogels are formed into any solid accumulation of materials such as droplets, particles, pastilles, strands, fibroids, from liquids provided above their gelation<br>
temperatures (Tgel) .  As is understood in the art, the Tgel<br>
25  is the temperature at which gel-to-sol transition occurs.<br>
It is preferred that the Tgel of the molten compositions be<br>
about between 20°C and 70°C when used to form the solid accumulations in forming the particlesor theinvention.  It is also preferred that the molten coating compositions be<br><br><br><br>
coated from about 5°C to 25°C above the Tgel of the composition.<br>
The particle-forming compositions of the invention may also form thermoreversible gels, although any type of gel formation may be used.  Generally, a thermoreversible<br>
organogel is characterized by the observation of a Tgel The<br>
Tgel may be determined by several different criteria, such<br>
as, for example, the temperature at which: (a) when a liquid 10  composition is cooled, there is a rapid, discrete,<br>
qualitative change from liquid to solid properties; (b) when a liquid composition is cooled, there is a sudden increase in hydrodynamic radius, as measured by dynamic light scattering methods; (c) when a liquid composition is warmed, a 1 mm drop of mercury will flow through the composition; and (d) the elastic and viscous moduli are equivalent.<br>
As noted above, the particles (which term is used to generically encompass the organogel particles of the invention, whether they are beads, strands, particles, shapes, fibroids, filamentary shapes, pastilles or any other solid accumulation) are formed from two distinct materials that may be present as two distinct phases.  The two distinct materials comprise what are referred to in the<br>
25  practice of the invention as the organic solid network, and the other component is referred to as the oleophilic liquid, oleophilic material or generally as the oleophilic organic 'medium. It may be difficult at timesto distinguish which material is apparently working at the various function<br>
30  because of the dimensions and intimacy of the materials.<br><br><br>
For example, two phase or multiphase systems may form, or what is generally referred to as interpenetrating networks, where the functions of the materials, particularly where both materials may be present as solids, cannot clearly be defined or distinguished as a supporting, carrier, or supported phase.  Even where a solid organic network is supporting a liquid organic medium, chilling the particle so that the liquid organic medium solidifies does not remove the particle from the practice of the invention.<br><br>
The gelation agent or organic solid network may be any organic material that passes from liquid to solid state during the cooling process, and with its solid structure supports the other organic medium.  The organic solid medium<br>
15  may comprise organic materials that are solids at the cool-down temperature, organic or inorganic waxes, polymers, copolymers, oligomers, and the like.  The term gelation is used, rather than some other term, because the process appears to act in the manner of a gel-forming process, and<br>
20  many of the particles appear to act as gels, rather than solid particles.<br>
The nature of some of the compositions, such as those that can be defined according to standards in the art as thermoreversible gels, are clearly gel and gelation compositions.  Non-limiting examples of liquid compositions that form thermoreversible organogels at or near room temperature include nitrocellulose in ethyl alcohol, and the like.  Although not wishing to be bound by theory, the 30  applicants postulate that thermoreversible organogels<br>
suitable for use in the present invention may contain a<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
polymer or copolymer wherein the polymer or copolymer chain contains two or more different functional groups or discrete regions, e.g., syndiotactic sequences prone to crystallite formation in a solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
It is believed that the addition of an alcohol to a polymer capable of hydrogen bonding prevents or reverses gel formation because of the hydrogen bonding of alcohol-based solvents with polymer sites capable of hydrogen bonding. The<br>
  requirements of the solvent blend are that it must not interact with polymer hydrogen bonding sites along the polymer chain and thereby interfere with the polymeric binder's ability to undergo hydrogen bonding with itself through the such sites, yet it must solvate the polymer at<br>
13  the non-hydrogen bonding sites and be an overall solvent for<br>
the polymer at temperatures above Tgel  A further<br>
requirement is that upon cooling below Tgel the polymer<br>
remains in solution forming a gel that is a homogeneous, clear, solid solution as opposed to forming an opaque heterogeneous mass.<br>
In using molten thermoreversible organogel solutions, it is necessary to form the particles at temperatures above the<br>
Tgel of the organogel.  On the other hand, it is desirable to<br>
perform the processing at the lowest possible temperature<br>
above Tgel in order to facilitate rapid onset of gelation<br>
after forming.  It has been found advantageous to provide a "chill-box" or similar rapid chilling mechanism which functions immediately after the forming operation to trigger rapid gelation to inhibit interlayer mixing. Preferably, the<br><br><br><br><br><br>
molten organogel temperatures during forming should be 5°C to 25°C above Tgel  More preferably, the molten organogel temperatures during coating should be from about 10°C to about 15°C above Tgel.<br>
The coating solutions or dispersions are solidified    organogels at or near room temperature, and liquids at a<br>
modestly elevated temperature.  The solutions are warmed to<br>
5°C to 25°C above their Tgel so that they are liquids.  The<br>
10  molten solutions are spray dried, prilled, pastilled,<br>
dispersion solidified, drip-dried, spray extruded, or as known by those of ordinary skill in the art to be otherwise formed into a solid particle by being cooled below their gel temperature while in particulate or droplet form.<br>

The term "PLURONIC™" refers to poloxamer compounds useful as gelation agents and which are sold collectively under the trademark PLURONIC (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.). PLURONIC F-127 (PL 127) corresponds to poloxamer 407, a polyoxypropylene-<br>
20  polyoxyethylene block copolymer described by Schmolka in the<br>
Journal of Biomedical Materials Research 6:571-582, 1972.<br>
Other PLURONIC™ compounds may be used in the present<br>
invention.  As used in this application, the terms PLURONIC™<br>
organogel, poloxamer organogel, and 25  polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene organogel are synonymous.<br>
Other non-limiting examples of gelation materials include waxes (e.g., beeswax, paraffin, water-insoluble wax, carbon-based wax, silicone wax, microcrystalline wax, etc.),<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
triglycerides, acid triglycerides, polymers, fluoroalkyl (meth)acrylate polymers and copolymers, acrylate polymers, ethylene/acrylate copolymers, polyethylene, polypropylene polymers and copolymers, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty 5 acid esters, fatty acid ethers, fatty acid amides, alkylene  polyhydric alcohols, fatty acid amide of an alkanolamine, glyceryl monostearate, (aryl-substituted)sugars, dibenzyl sorbitol (or mannitoal, rabbitol, etc.), condensates and precondensates of lower monohydric alcohols, trihydroic 10  alcohols, lower polyglycols, propylene/ethylene polycondensates, and the like.<br>
The oleophilic material may be any oleophilic material, whether a single pure compound, a solution, a composition, a<br>
15  mixture, an emulsion (e.g., an oil-in-water emulsion or preferably a water-in-oil emulsion), a dispersion, or the like.  Among the many types of oleophilic materials useful in the. inventive composition may be included oils, emollients (as described above), fragrances,' cosmetics,<br>
20  colorants; and skin active materials such as antimicrobial agents, medications, exfoliating agents, astringents, antioxidants, enzymes, sunscreens or ultraviolet radiation absorbing compositions, and the like.<br>
25  As noted the general range, when considering two phases, ranges from about 0.5% to 70% by weight of gelation agent<br>
     and from 70% to 99.5% by weight liquid oleophilic<br>
composition.  Alternative ranges of the gelation agent are from 1-60%, 1-50%, 1-30%, 2-25%, 5-25%, 7-25%, 10-25%, and<br>
20  12-20% by total weight of the particle or by weight of the hydrophobic liquid.  At the higher levels of gelation agent<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
(e.g., from 12%-30%, greater than 15%, and from 15-30% by weight), the particles tend to be gelled more firmly, and are very stable,<br>
5  Benefit  agents may be pure, raw, may contain dispersed<br>
materials or may have suspended or dispersed materials added to the oil.  For example, abrasive particles may be suspended to provide scrubbing or exfollient effects, silica,'titania, calcium carbonate, talc, starch, pigments,<br>
10  conductive particles, reflective particles, frangible<br>
particles, reactive materials, moisture sensitive particles (e.g., urea particles, zeolites, gas-generating particles), and the like.  Other forms of active or useful ingredients are described elsewhere.  The concentration of such<br>
10  materials may be from 0%, 0.001% to 20% or 40% of the hydrophobic component.<br>
Various other ingredients, some of which have been noted above, may also be included within the solution prior to<br>
15  being formed into droplets.  Such additional ingredients<br>
include (a) a wax or wax mixture of about 1 part by weight mineral ester wax having an acid value of about 0 to about<br>
20   55, about 4 parts by weight partly saponified mineral ester wax having an acid value of about 10 to about 4 5, about 1.5<br>

The properties of the particles may be controlled by various disciplines and additives as desired.  The size can be controlled by the size of spray heads, the degree of shearing forces, the temperatures of the initial gel<br>
25  solution, the gelation rate, the viscosity of the gel composition, and other physical mechanisms.<br>

The degree of softness and spreadablility as perceived with use of various inventive organogel particles was assessed according to test methods described below and the results are summarized in table 1.<br>

Example 6<br>
Isotropic cleansing compositions I to V were formulated as listed in table 2 and were evaluated for organogel particle stability. and particle hardness.  Composition I was prepared by dispersing the polyacrylate in excess  water.  Thereafter sorbic acid and trisodium citrate dihydrate were added to<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the resulting polymer dispersion.  The three surface-active agents were mixed, and the resulting mix added to the polymer dispersion.  Thereafter, minor components were added.  The viscosity of the resulting composition was      measured at the shear rate of 1/sec at 25°C and thickener added until the required viscosity was obtained.  Then the organogel particles were added to the final mix and the resultant mix filled into containers.<br>
  Compositions II &amp; III were processed in identical manner, except for the absence of dimethicone in composition III. Both compositions were prepared by combining the bulk of the water with SLES and sodium cocoyl isethionate, the mixture heated to about 7 5°C and mixed until a clear solution was<br>
  produced.  Then carbopol dispersed in water was added to the solution and subsequently neutralized with sodium hydroxide. Xanthan gum dispersion was then added to the mix.  At this point, dimethicone was added (Composition II).  Then the other surfactant and other minor components were added to<br>
20  the mix and blended together, while at the same time<br>
allowing the mix temperature to  cool.  Perfume was added when the batch temperature cooled down to about 35°C.  The viscosity of the resulting composition was measured and adjusted until the desired viscosity was attained.  Finally,<br>
25  the organogel particles were added.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The organogel particles contained about 98% sunflower seed oil and Polywax 500 blend at an 80:20 ratio and the remaining 2% balance consisted of pigment colorants.  The average particle size was about.1200 microns.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Assessment  of product   stability was   done  by  visual assessment  based  on  2-phase  separation  of  the  base  and particles  creaming to  the  top.<br>
6      Particle  Stability was   also measured  by the   Stoke  equation         (see below).<br>
Using  this  equation,   the  following  numbers   were  determined for  Composition   I: 10<br>
?   =  1010  kg/m3<br>
?   =  917   kg/m3<br>
?o = 2   x  106   ,   kg/m-sec<br>
Vs .3.65  x   10-11	m/sec  or   -   1 mm/year.<br>
15<br>
The 'creaming' rate of the particle at 25°C was determined to be about 1 mm/year.  This clearly shows the relative stability of the base in suspending the organogel particles. Results of the product stability evaluation revealed no<br>
20  signs of product separation nor accumulation of particles on the. product's surface.  The finished products were visually stable, i.e., the particles did not exhibit any signs of rising to the top, and remained uniformly distributed throughout the base.  The 'creaming' rate of the particle at<br>
25      25°C may also be evaluated using an accelerated aging test as summarized below:<br>
1.	51.7°C for a period of 1 month<br>
2.	40.5°C for a period of 1 month<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3.	-9.5°C/25°C - 3 complete cycles where 1 cycle constitute 23.5 hours under -9.5°C followed by another 23.5 hours under 25°C<br>
4.	40.5°C/25°C - 3 complete cycles<br>
Stability evaluation is performed visually by comparing the samples stored under accelerated conditions and the control sample (stored under 25°C)<br>
Example 7<br>
Organogel particles of the composition given in table 3 were made according to the following procedure.<br>
All three samples were spray chilled (prilled) using a pressure pot and single fluid nozzle.  The orifice diameter used in samples A and B was 0.020 inches and the orifice diameter of the nozzle used in sample C was 0.028 inches. The material was melted and the pot was heated to keep the material above 105°C.  The pressure used to prill sample A and B was 20 psi and the pressure used to prill C was 40 psi.<br>

A microscope, a microscope slide and a microscope coverslip are required.  A coverslip is placed on top of the slide.  A single, particle is obtained from the sample and placed on top of the coverslip. Using the microscope and a 1O x 15  objective, the diameter of the particle is measured. After measuring the particle, another coverslip is placed on top of the particle.  Sufficient weight is placed on top of the coverslip until the particle ruptures. The weight required<br>
to rupture the particle is recorded.  Cross sectional area<br><br>
15  of the particle is estimated as A = 0 r2 , where r is the<br>
radius of the particle.<br>
Particle Stability<br>
20 Particle Stability may be shown when the rate of particles  rising/floating ('creaming') to the top is very low. This    rate is measured by Stoke equation:<br>

Perceived organogel particle softness/hardness and ease of spreadability during use<br>
Panelists pour organogel particles (about 10 to 20) between the thumb and either the index and/or middle finger and press them gently between the fingers until the particles rupture.  The panelist then rate the particles' degree of softness/hardness based on the following rating scale - Very Hard, Hard, Just Right, Soft and Very Soft.  Then the panelists squeeze the ruptured particles in circular motion between fingers.<br>
To assess the particles' ease of spreadability, a small amount of sample (about 10 to 20 particles) is poured onto the back of one of the palms of a panelist.  Then these particles are squeezed gently, using forward and backward motions, against the back of the palm with the middle finger 20  and/or the index finger of the other hand.  Once the<br>
particles are completely spread over the back of the palm, the panelist will rate them for ease of spreadability using the following scale: Unacceptable, Slightly Acceptable and Highly Acceptable.<br>
