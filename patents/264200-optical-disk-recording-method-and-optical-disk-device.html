DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL DISK RECORDING METHOD, OPTICAL DISK DEVICE,<br>
PROGRAM, AND RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an optical disk<br>
recording method, an optical disk device, a program and a<br>
recording medium which are adapted to perform recording of<br>
information to an optical disk having a plurality of<br>
rewritable recording layers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, with progress of digital<br>
technology and improvement in data compression technology,<br>
information recording media for recording computer programs,<br>
music information, video information (contents), etc., which<br>
include optical disks, such as CD (compact disk) and DVD<br>
(digital versatile disk), have come to attract attention. And<br>
inexpensive optical disk devices for performing recording of<br>
information to such an optical disk and reproducing of<br>
information from the optical disk have come to spread.<br>
What are currently marketed as rewritable optical<br>
disks are CD-RW (CD-rewritable), DVD-RAM, DVD-RW (DVD-<br>
rewritable) , DVD+RW (DVD+rewritable), etc.<br>
Meanwhile, the amount of information of video<br><br>
-2-<br>
information or contents tends to increase year by year, and it<br>
is expected that the amount of information that is recordable<br>
on a single optical disk, i.e., the storage capacity, will<br>
further increase.<br>
For this reason, the development of an optical disk<br>
having a plurality of rewritable recording layers is performed<br>
energetically. However, there is a problem that at the time<br>
of recording (or reproducing) of information to a target<br>
recording layer of such a multilayered optical disk, which is<br>
distant from the plane of incidence of the irradiated light<br>
beam, the target recording layer is influenced not a little by<br>
a recording state of another recording layer of the disk<br>
nearer than the target recording layer to the plane of<br>
incidence. For example, see Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application No. 2004-327038.<br>
The influence depends on the material<br>
characteristics of the optical disk concerned, and it is not<br>
necessarily simple. Although the optical disk having the<br>
plurality of rewritable recording layers is not marketed<br>
currently, the above-mentioned problem is one of the issues<br>
which should be cleared for commercial production.<br>

According to one aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided an improved optical disk recording method in which<br><br>
-3-<br>
the above-mentioned problems are eliminated.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided any of an optical disk recording method, an optical<br>
disk device, a program, and a recording medium which are<br>
arranged for stably performing recording of information to an<br>
optical disk having a plurality of rewritable recording layers<br>
with high quality.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention which solves or<br>
reduces one or more of the above-mentioned problems, there is<br>

to the optical disk in one direction, the optical disk having<br>
a plurality of rewritable recording layers including a first<br>
recording layer nearest to a plane of incidence of the light<br>
beam and a second recording layer distant from the plane of<br>
incidence, the method comprising the steps of: specifying a<br>
target recording layer where user data is to be recorded from<br>
the first and second recording layers; detecting whether the<br>
specified target recording layer is the second recording<br>
layer; setting, prior to recording the user data to a<br>
requested address in the second recording layer when the<br>
specified target recording layer is the second recording layer,<br>
a partial region of the first recording layer corresponding to<br>
a radial position that is the same as that of the requested<br>
address in the second recording layer, to a selected recording<br><br>
-4-<br>
state of either a non-recorded state or a recorded state<br>
depending on a characteristic of the optical disk; and<br>
recording the user data to the requested address in the second<br>
recording layer specified as the target recording layer.<br>

recording method of the invention, when recording information<br>
in a second recording layer of a rewritable one-side multi-<br>
layered optical disk, which is different from a first<br>
recording layer nearest to the plane of incidence of the light<br>
beam, a partial region of the first recording layer<br>
corresponding to a radial position that is the same as that of<br>
the requested address in the second recording layer is set to<br>
a selected recording state of either a non-recorded state or a<br>
recorded state depending on the characteristic of the disk,<br>
prior to recording of user data to the requested address in<br>
the second recording layer. That is, the recording state of<br>
the partial region can be changed to the selected recording<br>
state appropriate for the characteristic of the disk prior to<br>
recording of information to the requested address in the<br>
target recording layer, and it is possible to control<br>

recording of information to an optical disk having a plurality<br>
of rewritable recording layers with high quality.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A description will now be given of an embodiment of<br>
the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the composition of an optical disk<br>
device 20 in an embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIG.<br>
1, the optical disk device 20 comprises a spindle motor 22 for<br>
rotating an optical disk 15, an optical pickup unit 23, a seek<br>
motor 21 for driving the optical pickup unit 23 in a radial<br>
direction of the disk 15, a laser control circuit 24, an<br>
encoder 25, a drive control circuit 26, a signal processing<br>
circuit 28, a buffer RAM 34, a buffer manager 37, an interface<br>
38, a flash memory 39, a CPU 40, and an RAM 41.<br>
In FIG. 1, the arrow merely indicates the flow of a<br>
typical signal or typical information, and it does not<br>
indicate the physical connection between respective elements<br>
of the optical disk device.<br>
In the present embodiment, the optical disk device<br>
20 is adapted to record information in a multi-layered optical<br>
disk which has a plurality of rewritable recording layers.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the structure of the optical disk in<br>
the optical disk device of FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
optical disk 15 is made up of a substrate MO, a recording<br>
layer L0, a middle layer ML, a recording layer L1 and a<br>
substrate M1 which are sequentially formed in this order from<br>
the plane of incidence of the irradiated laser light beam.<br><br>
-15-<br>
A translucent film MBO which is made of gold or a<br>
dielectric material is deposited between the recording layer<br>
LO and the middle layer ML, and a reflection film MBl which is<br>
made of aluminum or the like is deposited between the<br>
recording layer LI and the substrate Ml.<br>
The middle layer ML is made of an ultraviolet<br>
curing type resin material which indicates a high permeability<br>
to the light beam irradiated and has a refractive index near a<br>
refractive index of the substrate.<br>
Each of the recording layer L0 and the recording<br>
layer LI is a rewritable recording layer which is formed so<br>
that recorded information can be rewritten. Namely, the<br>
optical disk 15 is configured as a single-side two-recording-<br>
layer optical disk so that the light beam irradiated is<br>
incident to the optical disk from one direction only, and two<br>
rewritable recording layers are provided on a single side of<br>
the optical disk. The track which has a guide groove in the<br>
spiral or concentric circle configuration is formed in each of<br>
the recording layers L0 and L1 respectively.<br>
The optical disk 15 is placed in the optical disk<br>
device 20 so that the recording layer L0 is located closer to<br>
the optical pickup unit 23 than the recording layer L1<br>
A part of the light beam which is incident to the<br>
optical disk 15 is reflected by the translucent film MBO, and<br>
the remaining light beam penetrates the translucent film MBO.<br><br>
-16-<br>
The light beam which passes through the translucent film MBO<br>
is reflected by the reflection film MB1.<br>
The optical pickup unit 23 is arranged for focusing<br>
the laser light beam onto a recording layer of the accessing<br>
object (which is called "target recording layer") of the two<br>
recording layers of the optical disk 15, and for receiving the<br>
reflected light beam from the optical disk 15.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the composition of the optical pickup<br>
unit 23 in the optical disk device of FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the optical pickup unit 23<br>
comprises a light source unit 51, a coupling lens 52, a<br>
polarization beam splitter 54, a quarter-wave plate 55, an<br>
objective lens 60, a detection lens 58, a photodetector PD as<br>
a light intensity detector, and an actuator system AC for<br>
driving the objective lens 60.<br>
The light source unit 51 is provided to include a<br>
semiconductor laser LD as the light source which emits a laser<br>
light beam that has a wavelength in conformity with the<br>
optical disk 15. In this embodiment, the maximum intensity<br>
output direction of the laser beam which is emitted from the<br>
light source unit 51 is set to the direction of +X indicated<br>
by the arrow in FIG. 3. It is supposed that the light source<br>
unit 51 emits a polarized laser light beam which direction of<br>
polarization of the laser light (P polarization) is parallel<br>
to the plane of incidence to the polarization beam splitter 54.<br><br>
-17-<br>
The coupling lens 52 is arranged on the +X side of<br>
the light source unit 51 so that the light beam emitted from<br>
the light source unit 51 is converted into a parallel light<br>
beam by the coupling lens 52.<br>
The polarization beam splitter 54 is arranged on<br>
the +X side of the coupling lens 52. The polarization beam<br>
splitter 54 has a reflection factor that varies depending on<br>
the polarization state of the light beam incident to the<br>
polarization beam splitter 54. In this embodiment, the<br>
polarization beam splitter 54 is provided so that it has a<br>
small reflection factor when the incidence light beam is in p-<br>
polarized state, and has a large reflection factor when the<br>
incidence light beam is in s-polarized state. Namely, the<br>
major part of the light beam which is emitted from the light<br>
source unit 51 can penetrate the polarization beam splitter 54.<br>
The quarter-wave plate 55 is arranged on the +X<br>
side of the polarization beam splitter 54. The quarter-wave<br>
plate 55 gives an optical phase difference of 1/4 wavelength<br>
to the light beam incident to the quarter-wave plate 54. The<br>
objective lens 60 is arranged on the +X side of the quarter-<br>
wave plate 55, and the light beam passing through the quarter-<br>
wave plate 55 is focused onto the target recording layer of<br>
the optical disk by the objective lens 60.<br>
The detection lens 58 is arranged on the -Z side of<br>
the polarization beam splitter 54, and focuses the returned<br><br>
-18-<br>
light beam, which is branched in the -Z direction at the<br>
polarization beam splitter 54, onto the light-receiving<br>
surface of the photodetector PD.<br>
The photodetector PD includes a plurality of light<br>
receiving elements (or light receiving areas) which are<br>
suitably arranged for the signal processing circuit 28 to<br>
output appropriate signals (photoelectric conversion signals)<br>
for detecting an RF signal, a wobble signal, a servo signal,<br>
etc.<br>
The actuator system AC includes a tracking actuator<br>
for actuating the objective lens 60 by its small displacement<br>
in the focusing direction which is an optical axis direction<br>
of the objective lens 60, and a focusing actuator for<br>
actuating the objective lens 60 by its small displacement in<br>
the tracking direction of the objective lens 60.<br>
For the sake of convenience of description in the<br>
following, the optimal position of the objective lens 60 with<br>
respect to the focusing direction when the target recording<br>
layer is the recording layer L0 will be called the "first lens<br>
position", and the optimal position of the objective lens 60<br>
with respect to the focusing direction when the target<br>
recording layer is the recording layer L1will be called the<br>
"second lens position".<br>
Next, the operation of the above-described optical<br>
pickup unit 23 will be explained.<br><br>
-19-<br>
The linearly polarized light beam (which is in p-<br>
polarized state) emitted from the light source unit 51 is<br>
turned into a generally parallel light beam by the coupling<br>
lens 52, and this parallel light beam enters into the<br>
polarization beam splitter 54. The major part of this<br>
incident light beam penetrates the polarization beam splitter<br>
54, and it is converted into a circularly polarized light beam<br>
by the quarter-wave plate 55, and this circularly polarized<br>
light beam is focused on the target recording layer of the<br>
optical disk 15 as a minute light spot through the objective<br>
lens 60.<br>
The reflected light beam from the optical disk 15<br>
becomes a circularly polarized light beam with the opposite<br>
polarization direction, and this circularly polarized light<br>
beam is again turned into a generally parallel light beam by<br>
the objective lens 60 as a returned light beam. And this<br>
returned light beam is converted into the linearly polarized<br>
light (which is in s-polarized state) that is perpendicular to<br>
the forward optical path by the quarter-wave plate 55.<br>
The returned light beam passing through the<br>
quarter-wave plate 55 enters into the polarization beam<br>
splitter 54. The returned light beam which is reflected to<br>
the -Z direction by the polarization beam splitter 54 is<br>
received by the photodetector PD through the detection lens 58.<br>
In the photodetector PD, photoelectric conversion<br><br>
-20-<br>
of the incident light beam is carried out by each of the<br>
plurality of light receiving elements (or light receiving<br>
areas), and each of the plurality of photo-electrically<br>
converted signals is outputted from the photodetector PD to<br>
the signal processing circuit 28, respectively.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the signal processing<br>
circuit 28 is configured to acquire servo signals (a focus<br>
error signal, a track error signal, etc.), address information,<br>
synchronization information, an RF signal, etc. based on the<br>
plurality of output signals (the photo-electrically converted<br>
signals) of the photodetector PD.<br>
The servo signals acquired by the signal processing<br>
circuit 28 are outputted to the drive control circuit 26, the<br>
address information acquired by the signal processing circuit<br>
28 is outputted to the CPU 40, and the synchronization<br>
information acquired by the signal processing circuit 28 is<br>
outputted to the encoder 25 and the drive control circuit 26.<br>
Moreover, the signal processing circuit 28 performs<br>
decoding processing and error detection processing of the<br>
acquired RF signal. When an error in the RF signal is<br>
detected, the signal processing circuit 28 performs error<br>
correction processing of the RF signal. The resulting signal<br>
after the error correction processing is completed is stored<br>
in the buffer RAM 34 through the buffer manager 37 as the<br>
reproduced data. The address information contained in the<br><br>
-21-<br>
reproduced data is outputted to the CPU 40.<br>
The drive control circuit 26 generates a drive<br>
signal to the tracking actuator for correcting a positional<br>
error of the objective lens 60 in the tracking direction,<br>
based on the track error signal received from the signal<br>
processing circuit 28.<br>
The drive control circuit 26 generates a drive<br>
signal to the focusing actuator AC for correcting a focusing<br>
error of the objective lens 60, based on the focus error<br>
signal received from the signal processing circuit 28. Each<br>
of the actuator drive signals generated by the drive control<br>
circuit 26 is outputted to the optical pickup unit 23.<br>
Thereby, the tracking control and the focusing control of the<br>
optical pickup unit 23 are performed by the drive control<br>
circuit 26.<br>
Moreover, the drive control circuit 26 generates a<br>
drive signal for driving the seek motor 21 and a drive signal<br>
for driving the spindle motor 22, based on the command signals<br>
received from the CPU 40. Each of the drive signals is<br>
outputted from the drive control circuit 26 to the seek motor<br>
21 and the spindle motor 22, respectively.<br>
The data (the recording data) to be recorded to the<br>
optical disk 15, and the data (the reproduced data) being<br>
reproduced from the optical disk 15 are temporarily stored in<br>
the buffer RAM 34. The input/output operation of data to and<br><br>
-22-<br>
from the buffer RAM 34 is managed by the buffer manager 37.<br>
Based on the command signal of the CPU 40, the<br>
encoder 25 reads out the recording data from the buffer RAM 34<br>
through the buffer manager 37, performs modulation of the data,<br>
and addition of the error correction code, and generates the<br>
write signal to the optical disk 15. The write signal<br>
generated by the encoder 25 is outputted to the laser control<br>
circuit 24.<br>
The laser control circuit 24 controls the emission<br>
power of the semiconductor laser LD. For example, in the case<br>
of recording information to the optical disk, the laser<br>
• control circuit 24 generates a drive signal to the<br>
semiconductor laser LD based on the write signal, the<br>
recording condition, and the light emission characteristic of<br>
the semiconductor laser LD.<br>
The interface 38 is a bidirectional communication<br>
interface between the optical disk device 20 and the host<br>
device 90 (for example, a personal computer). The interface<br>
38 is adapted to be in conformity with the standard interfaces,<br>
such as ATAPI (AT Attachment Packet Interface), SCSI (Small<br>
Computer System Interface), and USB (Universal Serial Bus).<br>
In the flash memory 39, various programs including<br>
the program according to the invention which is described in<br>
instruction codes decodable by the CPU 40, the recording<br>
condition including the recording power and the recording<br><br>
-23-<br>
strategy information, the light emission characteristic of the<br>
semiconductor laser LD, etc. are stored.<br>
The CPU 40 controls the operation of each of the<br>
device components in accordance with the above-mentioned<br>
program stored in the flash memory 39, and stores the data<br>
required for the control in the RAM 41 and the buffer RAM 34.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining the OTP system.<br>
It is supposed that information is recorded in the optical<br>
disk 15 in accordance with the OTP (opposite track path)<br>
system as shown in FIG. 4. The recording layer L0 is arranged<br>
to include the lead-in region, the data region, and the middle<br>
region, which are arrayed in this order from the inside radial<br>
position of the disk to the outside radial position of the<br>
disk. The recording layer Ll is arranged to include the<br>
middle region, the data region, and the lead-out region, which<br>
are arrayed in this order from the outside radial position of<br>
the disk to the inside radial position of the disk.<br>
The physical address which increases continuously<br>
from the lead-in region to the middle region is assigned for<br>
the recording layer L0, and the physical address which is<br>
created by inversion of bits of the physical address of the<br>
corresponding area of the recording layer L0 and continuously<br>
increases from the middle region to the lead-out region is<br>
assigned for the recording layer Ll.<br>
The direction of the track path in the case of the<br><br>
-24-<br>
OTP system is as follows. The direction of the track path for<br>
the recording layer L0 is the direction from the lead-in<br>
region to the middle region. The direction of the track path<br>
for the recording layer LI is the direction from the middle<br>
region to the lead-out region.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram for explaining the disk<br>
information area. FIG. 6 is a diagram for explaining the<br>
bitmap information. As shown in FIG. 5, the disk information<br>
area for storing disk information is provided in the lead-in<br>
region of the recording layer L0 of the optical disk 15. As<br>
shown in FIG. 6, the bitmap information which contains a given<br>
number of bits each indicating either the non-recorded state<br>
or the recorded state for every partial region in the data<br>
region is recorded in the disk information area. Namely, the<br>
partial region of the data region corresponding to "1" in the<br>
bitmap information is in the non-recorded state, and the<br>
partial region of the data region corresponding to "0" in the<br>
bitmap information is in the recorded state. Regardless of<br>
whether the currently recorded data is the user data or the<br>
dummy data, a corresponding bit of the bitmap information is<br>
set to "0". The size of the partial region in the optical<br>
disk is predetermined.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram for explaining the PTP system.<br>
Apart from the above-described optical disk 15 shown in FIG. 4,<br>
a single-side two-recording-layer write-once optical disk of<br><br>
-25-<br>
another type in which information is recorded in accordance<br>
with the PTP (Parallel Track Path) system is also known. As<br>
shown in FIG. 7, in the optical disk according to the PTP<br>
system, the information area is formed for each of the two<br>
recording layers L0 and Ll, and the information area of each<br>
recording layer is divided into the lead-in region, the data<br>
region, and the lead-out region, which are arrayed in this<br>
order from the inside radial position of the disk to the<br>
outside radial position of the disk, respectively.<br>
In the case of the single-side two-recording-layer<br>
optical disk according to the PTP system, the information area<br>
is provided individually for each of the two recording layers,<br>
and the respective recording layers can be considered as being<br>
an independent recording layer. For each recording layer, the<br>
physical address which increases continuously from the lead-in<br>
region to the lead-out region is assigned, respectively.<br>
The direction of the track path in the case of the<br>
PTP system is as follows. The direction of the track path for<br>
each recording layer is the direction from the lead-in region<br>
to the lead-out region.<br>
Next, the recording processing which is performed<br>
by the optical disk device 20 when a recording request command<br>
from the host device 90 is received will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 8A through FIG. IOC.<br>
The flowchart of FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B corresponds to<br><br>
-26-<br>
a series of steps in the processing algorithm performed by the<br>
CPU 40. FIG. 8A shows a part of the flowchart including steps<br>
401 to 425, and FIG. 8B shows the remaining part of the<br>
flowchart including steps 427 to 433.<br>
When a recording request command is received from<br>
the host device 90, the start address of the program<br>
corresponding to the flowchart of FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B stored<br>
beforehand in the flash memory 38 is set to the program<br>
counter of the CPU 40, and execution of the recording<br>
processing is initiated.<br>
In the flowchart of FIG. 8A, at step 401, the CPU<br>
40 controls the drive control circuit 26 so that the optical<br>
disk 15 is rotated at a predetermined linear velocity (or<br>
angular velocity), and notifies the signal processing circuit<br>
28 that the recording request command is received from the<br>
host device 90. In addition, the CPU 40 resets the saving<br>
flag to "0". The saving flag is provided to indicate the<br>
existence of data being saved. The saving flag which is set<br>
to "0" at this step means that there is no data saved. On the<br>
other hand, the saving flag which is set to "1" means that<br>
there is data saved.<br>
Next, at step 403, the CPU 40 extracts a requested<br>
address (referred to as A) from the recording request command,<br>
and specifies, according to the requested address A, one of<br>
the recording layer L0 and the recording layer LI as being a<br><br>
-27-<br>
target recording layer where user data is to be recorded.<br>
Next, at step 405, the CPU 40 determines whether<br>
the specified target recording layer is the recording layer LI.<br>
When the specified target recording layer is the recording<br>
layer LI, the result of the determination at this step is<br>
affirmative and the control shifts to step 407.<br>
At step 407, the CPU 40 specifies a partial region<br>
(which is referred to as "area B") of the recording layer L0<br>
which is located at the radial position that is the same as<br>
that of the recording layer Ll corresponding to the requested<br>
address A. In this case, the physical address of the area B<br>
is created by inversion of bits of the physical address of the<br>
requested address A.<br>
Next, at step 409, the CPU 40 retrieves the disk<br>
information (disk ID, disk kind, etc.) in the disk information<br>
area of the optical disk 15, and determines whether the<br>
optical disk 15 is an optical disk of the type in which the<br>
recording quality at the requested address A is influenced by<br>
the recording state (the non-recorded state or the recorded<br>
state) of the area B.<br>
When the optical disk 15 is an optical disk of the<br>
type in which the recording quality at the requested address A<br>
is affected by the recording state of the area B, the result<br>
of the determination at this step is affirmative, and the<br>
control shifts to step 411.<br><br>
-28-<br>
At step 411, the CPU 40 retrieves the recording<br>
condition stored in the flash memory 39, and acquires the<br>
condition related to the recording state of the area B in the<br>
optical disk 15. In this respect, the recording condition<br>
related to the recording state (the non-recorded state or the<br>
recorded state) of one of the two recording layers located<br>
near the objective lens 60 when recording information on the<br>
other of the two recording layers located distant from the<br>
objective lens 60 is stored beforehand in the flash memory 39<br>
as one of the recording conditions for every disk kind.<br>
Next, at step 413, the CPU 40 retrieves the disk<br>
information in the disk information area of the lead-in region<br>
of the optical disk 15 and acquires the bitmap information of<br>
the area B.<br>
Next, at step 415, the CPU 40 determines whether<br>
the condition related to the recording state of the area B in<br>
the optical disk 15, acquired at the step 411, is the non-<br>
recorded state. When the acquired condition related to the<br>
recording state of the area B in the optical disk 15 is the<br>
non-recorded state, the result of the determination at this<br>
step is affirmative, and the control shifts to step 417.<br>
At step 417, the CPU 40 determines whether the<br>
recording state of the area B is the non-recorded state, based<br>
on the bitmap information of the area B acquired at the step<br>
413. When the recording state of the area B is the recorded<br><br>
-29-<br>
state as shown in FIG. 9A, the result of the determination is<br>
negative, and the control shifts to step 419.<br>
At step 419, the CPU 40 controls the drive control<br>
circuit 26 so that the optical pickup unit 23 is driven to the<br>
target position corresponding to the area B, sets the target<br>
recording layer to the recording layer LO, and reads the data<br>
currently recorded in the area B and stores the read data in<br>
the RAM 41 as the saved data. Namely, the content of the<br>
recorded information of the area B is saved at this step. And<br>
the CPU 40 sets the saving flag to "1", which means that there<br>
is data saved.<br>
Next, at step 421, the CPU 40 controls the laser<br>
control circuit 24 so that the data currently recorded in the<br>
area B is erased, and the area B is set in the non-recorded<br>
state as shown in FIG. 9B. Specifically, the area B of the<br>
recording layer L0 in the optical disk 15 is irradiated by the<br>
laser beam of a predetermined erase power from the optical<br>
pickup unit 23. And the CPU 40 performs a layer jump and sets<br>
the target recording layer to the recording layer LI.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, at step 427, the CPU 40<br>
controls the encoder 25 and the laser control circuit 24 so<br>
that the optical pickup unit 23 records the requested data<br>
(user data) in the area in the recording layer LI indicated by<br>
the requested address A, as shown in FIG. 9C.<br>
Next, at step 429, the CPU 40 retrieves the saving<br><br>
-30-<br>
flag and determines whether there is any data saved. In this<br>
case, the saving flag is set to "1" which means that there is<br>
data saved, and the result of the determination at this step<br>
is affirmative, and the control shifts to step 431.<br>
At step 431, the CPU 40 reads out the saved data<br>
stored in the RAM 41, performs a layer jump, and sets the<br>
target recording layer to the recording layer L0. And the CPU<br>
40 records the saved data in the area B, as shown in FIG. 9D,<br>
and sets the saving flag to "0".<br>
Next, at step 433, the CPU 40 notifies to the host<br>
device 90 the end of the recording processing. And the<br>
recording processing is terminated.<br>
When the saving flag retrieved at the step 429<br>
indicates there is no data saved, the result of the<br>
determination at the step 429 is negative, and the control<br>
shifts to the above step 433.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 8A, when the recording state<br>
• of the area B based on the acquired bitmap information of the<br>
area B is determined at the step 417 as being the non-recorded<br>
state (or when the result of the determination at the step 417<br>
is affirmative), the control shifts to the above step 427.<br>
On the other hand, when the condition related to<br>
the recording state of the area B in the optical disk 15 is<br>
determined at the step 415 as being the recorded state (or<br>
when the result of the determination at the step 415 is<br><br>
-31-<br>
negative), the control shifts to step 423.<br>
At step 423, the CPU 40 determines whether the<br>
recording state of the area B is the recorded state. When the<br>
recording state of the area B is the recorded state, the<br>
result of the determination at this step is affirmative, and<br>
the control shifts to the above step 427.<br>
On the other hand, when the recording state of the<br>
area B is the non-recorded state as shown in FIG. 10A, the<br>
result of the determination at this step is negative, and the<br>
control shifts to step 425.<br>
At step 425, the CPU 40 controls the drive control<br>
circuit 26 so that the optical pickup unit 23 is driven to the<br>
target position corresponding to the area B, sets the target<br>
recording layer to the recording layer L0, and controls the<br>
encoder 25 and the laser control circuit 24 so that the<br>
optical pickup unit 23 records dummy data in the area B of the<br>
recording layer L0, as shown in FIG. 10B. And the CPU 40<br>
performs a layer jump, and sets the target recording layer to<br>
the recording layer LI. Then, the control shifts to the above<br>
step 427. In this case, the recording state of each recording<br>
layer of the optical disk after the user data is recorded at<br>
the step 427 is as shown in FIG. IOC.<br>
When the optical disk 15 is determined at the step<br>
409 as being not an optical disk of the type in which the<br>
recording quality at the requested address A is affected by<br><br>
-32-<br>
the recording state of the area B (or when the result of the<br>
determination at the step 409 is negative), the control shifts<br>
to the above step 427.<br>
When the specified target recording layer is<br>
determined at the step 405 as being not the recording layer LI<br>
(or when the result of the determination at the step 405 is<br>
negative), the control shifts to the above step 427.<br>
As is apparent from the above explanation, the<br>
recording processing performed by the optical disk device 20<br>
of the present embodiment may be implemented by the program<br>
executed by the CPU 40 and the CPU 40. Alternatively, at<br>
least a part of the recording processing performed by the CPU<br>
40 according to the program may be implemented by using the<br>
hardware arrangement. Alternatively, all of the recording<br>
processing may be implemented by using the hardware<br>
arrangement.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the program<br>
according to the invention is implemented by executing the<br>
program corresponding to the flowchart of FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B<br>
among the programs recorded in the flash memory 39 which is a<br>
computer-readable recording medium. The optical disk<br>
recording method according to the invention is implemented by<br>
performing the above-mentioned recording processing.<br>
As explained above, according to the optical disk<br>
device 20 of the present embodiment, when the target recording<br><br>
-33-<br>
layer in which user data is being recorded is the recording<br>
layer L1 hich is located distant from the plane of incidence<br>
of the light beam among the two recording layer L0and L1 it<br>
is determined in advance of recording of the user data in the<br>
recording layer Ll whether the recording quality at the<br>
requested address in the recording layer L0 is affected by the<br>
recording state of the corresponding area in the recording<br>
layer Ll.<br>
When the recording quality at the requested address<br>
in the recording layer L0 is affected, the recording state of<br>
the partial region of the recording layer L0 which is located<br>
at a radial position that is the same as that of the partial<br>
region of the recording layer Ll where the user data is being<br>
recorded is set to a selected recording state depending on the<br>
characteristic of the optical disk 15.<br>
For example, when the optical disk 15 has the<br>
characteristic that, if a non-recorded area exists in the<br>
partial region of the recording layer L0 the recording<br>
quality in the recording layer L1 eteriorates, dummy data is<br>
recorded in the partial region of the recording layer L0 so<br>
that the non-recorded state of the partial region of the<br>
recording layer L0 is changed to the recorded state.<br>
On the other hand, when the optical disk 15 has the<br>
characteristic that, if a recorded area exists in the partial<br>
region of the recording layer L0 the recording quality in the<br><br>
-34-<br>
recording layer L1 eteriorates, the data currently recorded<br>
in the partial region of the recording layer L0 is saved in<br>
the RAM 41, and thereafter the data currently recorded in the<br>
partial region of the recording layer L0 is erased so that the<br>
recorded state of the partial region of the recording layer LO<br>
is changed to the non-recorded state. And the user data is<br>
recorded to the requested address A in the recording layer L1,<br>
and then the saved data is recorded again to the erased<br>
partial region of the recording layer LO.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to perform stably<br>
recording of information in the optical disk 15 with high<br>
quality according to the characteristic of the optical disk 15.<br>
Namely, it is possible to perform stably recording of<br>
information to an optical disk having a plurality of<br>
rewritable recording layers with high quality.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, when changing<br>
the recording state of the partial region of the recording<br>
layer LO, the bitmap information stored in the lead-in region<br>
is retrieved, and the recording processing can be performed<br>
quickly.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, the optical disk<br>
15 on which information is recorded according to the OTP<br>
system has been used. However, the present invention is not<br>
limited to this embodiment. Alternatively, an optical disk in<br>
which information is recorded according to the PTP system may<br><br>
-35-<br>
be used.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, when recording<br>
user data in the data region of the recording layer L1 of the<br>
optical disk 15, the recording state of the area B of the<br>
recording layer L0 is changed. However, the present invention<br>
is not limited to this embodiment. For example, when<br>
recording predetermined information in the lead-out region of<br>
the recording layer LI, or when recording predetermined<br>
information in the middle region of the recording layer L1,<br>
the recording state of the area B of the recording layer L0<br>
may be changed. In this case, the bitmap information may be<br>
extended to new bitmap information in which the recording<br>
state of the lead-in region and the recording state of the<br>
middle region of the recording layer L0 are also defined in<br>
addition of the recording state of the lead-out region.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, the optical disk<br>
device in which recording and reproducing of information is<br>
possible has been described. However, the present invention<br>
is not limited to this embodiment, and it is applicable to any<br>
optical disk device in which recording of information is<br>
possible. Moreover, when the optical disk is a DVD, the<br>
optical disk device of the invention may be a DVD recorder in<br>
which the above-mentioned recording processing of the DVD is<br>
possible.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, the optical disk<br><br>
