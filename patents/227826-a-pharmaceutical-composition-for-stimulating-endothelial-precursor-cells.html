Endothelial cells also pGrticlpate in the formation of new blood vessels. Blood vessel formation is important in a large number" ot processes, such as embryogen8sis, the female reproductive cycle, wound healing, tumor growth and neovascularization of ischemic regions. Originally, postnatal blood vessel formation, or Ir1 other words blood vessel formation after birth, was attributed mainly to angiogenic processes. By angiogenesis there will be understood the development of new blood vessels by sprouting of capillaries tram a preexisting vascular system During angiogenesis, the basement mejnbrane surrounding Hie blood vessels is first destroyed by means of proteolytic enzymes, and the exlracellular matrix in the perivascuar space is fragmented. The anglogerw; stITnUII released thereby cause already existing differentiated endothelial cells to migrate toward the chemotactic stimulus, during Milch process they simultaneously proliferate and are transformed. New vascular loops with a capillary type lumen are then formed by accretion of endothelial cells Thereafter synthesis of a rle\N l)asement rnenlbrane begins<br>

By uSjng animal models, it was proved that the endothelial progenitor cells derived from bone marrow particibate actively in neovascularization It was also shown that a specific C034-positive subgroup of leukocytes expresslflg endothelium-speciflc antigens becomes established in Ischemic regions. In addition, endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) that contribute significantly to the formation of blood vessels in the adult organism can be obtained in vitro from CD133+ and CD34+ cells (Asahara et a/., Science, 275 (1997), 964-967; Crosby et a/., Cite. Res., 87 (2000), 728-730; Gehling et al.. B/ood, 95 (2000), 31063112) It Was also shown that trJJection of isolated CD34+ cells or cultivated endothelial progenitor cells accelerates restoration of Wood flow in diabetic mice (Schatteman jet al.. J. Clin. Invest.. 106 (2000),571-578) and improves .leovascularization In vivo (Asahara et al.. Circ. Res' 85 (1999) 221
et al., Nat. Med .. 7 (2001). 4:30436). Besides C034+ cells, C034-negetive mononuclear blood cells can al~o be used as a Source of endothelial progenitor cells by appropriate tr ansrJ.fierentiatiorS.<br>
However, the mechanisms underlying mobllHd.tion and dif1i:.Jfr;"!T/tlat|ofllof endothelial progenitor cells have not yet bc.'ofl tully expld.jned. MolC;CUIr3r hiological and cytolJloloyical<br>
investigations indicate that various cytokines and angiogenic growHI factors -lave stirTIUIating effects on mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells in bone marrow. For example, it IS known thai proanglogenlc factors such as VEGF and GMCSF can Increase the number of endothelial progenitor cells (Asahara et al., EMBO, J., 18 (1999), 3964-3972; Takahashi et al., Nat. Med., 5 (1999), 434438) VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) IS a protein that occurs in various Ispfmms and that binds to the two tyrosine kinase receptors VEC3F-R1 (flt-1) and VEGF-R2 (flk-1), which occur, for example, on H-JI8 surface of growing endothelial cells (Wemert et al., Angew. Chemie, 21 (1999), 3432-3435). Activation of VEGF receptors leads via the Ras-RafMAP kinase pathway to expression of proteinases and specific integnns on the surface of endothelial cells or endothelial progenitor cells, and finally to initiation of proliferation and migration (If these cells toward the angiogenic stimulus. GM CSf-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is a cytokine n-l21t heretofore was known mainly for stimulation (jf white blood corpuscles. Including neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils. PIGF (placental grov,1h factor) is known tC\ stimulate the mobilization of endothelial progenitor celis but :1ot proliferation thereof. From investigations by LleViidot et al. (.J. Clin. Invest.. 108 (7001), 399-405). jj fc)llows HW.t HMQ~-Co,A, reductase inhibitors, especially statins, which are usod as lifJlcJ-ln\N(;rinq m8Jicam8nts and which reduce the morbirJity and rrjortality of coronary disease, are able to rflOUill/8 t';l-ldothclial progenitor- cells.

progenitor cells into endothelial cells. By "endothelial ceils'-' therein be understood the cells that form the endothelium, or in other words the monolayer cellular lining of vessels and serous cavities. Ejidothelial cells are characterized in that they release vasoactive substances, for example vasodilating substances such as EDRF (endothelial derived relaxing factor) or constricting substances such as endothelin, factors for inhibition or activation of blood clotting arW factors for regulation of ascular permeability. Endothelial cells also synthesize components of the subendotheliai connective tissue, especially type IV and V col lagens, cell adhesion proteins such as laminin, fibronectin and thrombospondin, growth factors, for example for smooth muscle cells, and factors for the formation of new vessels, in connection with the present invention, there will be understood by 'migration' of endothelial progenitor cells the fact that the endothelial progenitor cells present in the bloodstream migrate towar J a vasculogenic or angiogenic stimulus and become concentrated in the region of the vasculogenic or angiogenic stimulus. By "vasculogenic stimulus" there will be understood a chemical stimulus in a tissue or blood vessel of a human or animal body that acts specifically on endothelial progenitor cells and brings about migration thereof to that site in the body from which the chemical stimulus originates- In ths way, the vascutogenesis process is induced by the vasculogenic stimulus. By "angiogenic stimulus" there will be understood a chemical stimulus in a tissue or blood vessel of a human or animal body that acts specifically on differentiated endothelial cells and brings atiout migration thereof to that site in the body from which the chemical stimulus originates. In this way, induction of angiogenesis is induced by the angiogenic stimulus.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided the use of low-dosage erythropoietin and/or derivatives thereof for increasing the adhesion ability of endothelial progenitor cells undergoing differentiation. According to the invention erythropoietin is used in particular for improving the adhesion ability or in other words the cell-to-ce)! adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells, The adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells undergoing differentiation or differentiated endothelial cells is one of the basic prerequisites for the formation of new vessels or of new endothelial tissue. Cell adhesion is mediated by protein molecules.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of low-dosage ejytnropoietin for stimulation of the formation of new vessels, especially stimulation of vasculogenesis. In connection with the present invention, there will be understood by "vasculogenesis" the formation of new vessels from endothelial progenitor cells undergoing differentiation in situ.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, it is ensured by the use of low-dosage erythropoietin that endothelial progenitor cells can participate to an increased degree in formation of new vessels or in focal formation of new vessels to restore damaged vascular regions. According to the invention, therefore, it is provided that the use of low-dosage erythropoietin and/or its derivatives will promote formation of new blood vessels and/or replacement of damaged vascular regions through local formation of new blood vessels, In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided the use of low-dosage erythropoietin and/or derivatives thereof for stimulation of endothelial progenitor cells for formation of endothelial tissue.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided the use of low-dosage erythropoietin and/or derivatives thereof<br>
for the therapy of pathological states or diseases of the hum^n or animal body associated with a dysfunction of endothelial progenitor<br>
cells, or of sequelae thereof.	•<br>
fn connection with the present invention, there will be understood py ""diseases", "pathological states" or "disorders" impairments of vital<br>
processes in organs or in the entire organism, resulting in subjectively experienced or objectively detectable physical, emotional or mental<br>
changes. According to the invention, these diseases are associated in particular with a dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells, or in<br>
other words diseases that either are the result of such a dysfunction of these cells or are mediated by these cells. Also according to the<br>
present invention, there will be understood by "diseases", "patljolqgical states" or "disorders" impairments of vital processes in organs or<br>
in the entire organism that can be arrested or in particular slowed in their progression by administration of low-dosage erythropoietin or<br>
suitable active ingredients. By "sequelae" there will be understood secondary diseases, or in other words a second disorder occurring in<br>
addition to a primary clinical condition.	|<br>
In connection with the present invention, there will be underetckxj by "dysfunction" of endothelial progenitor cells an impairment of essential cell functions such as metabolic activities, response iff stimuli, motility, dividing behavior or differentiation behavior of these cells. A dysfunction of endothelial progenitor ceifs may mean, for e&gt;c&amp;mple, that these cells proliferate not at all or only inadequately. Since the proliferation of endothetial progenitor ceils is stimulated by the use of erythropoietin, the deficient dividing behavior both of endothelial progenitor cells and of already differentiated endothelial cells c^n thereby be compensated and the number of endothelial progenitor cells or endothelial cells increased. Dysfunction of endothelial projjennor cells may consist, for example, of impaired ability of these ceils to differentiate to endotheiial cells. A dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells may also be caused by their impaired adhesion ability and/or<br>
8<br><br>
their impaired ability to migrate toward an angiogenic or vasculdjerjic stimulus. Such dysfunctions of endothelial progenitor cells may lead,<br>
for example, to impairment or prevention of the formation of new endothelial tissue and/or of vasculogenesis. A dysfunction of endothelial<br>
progenitor cells may also have a pathogenic cause,   for   example   due   to   hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, elevated ADMA<br>
blood levels, uremia or diabetes. The dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells may be manifested, for example, by reduced production of<br>
NO (=EDRF) by NO synthases (NOS) from L-arginine, increased endothelin production and/or increased production of adhesion<br>
molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAIvM.	\.<br>
According to the invention, the diseases associated witti a dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells are in particular<br>
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes meltitus, insulin resistance, enWielium-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders such as   vascular<br>
inflammations,   endotheliosis   including retfculoendotheliosisjj     atherosclerosis,      age-related ardiovascular disease, ischemic<br>
disorders  of  the extremities, Raynaud's disease, preedamnsia pregnancy- induced hypertension, chronic or acute renal failure,<br>
especially terminal renal failure, renal function restrictions with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 80 ml/min, preferably 40 to 80 ml/min,<br>
microaJbuminuria, proteinuria, elevated ADMA levels, wound healing and sequelae thereof.<br>
"Hypercholesterolemia" is characterized by elevated concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. By far the most frequent form of primary<br>
hypercholesterolemia is polygenic hypercholesterolemia.    Sejjomiary    hypercholesterolemia frequently occurs in diabetes mellitus,<br>
nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism and hepatic disorders.       i j<br>
"Diabetes mellitus" encompasses various forms of glucose metabolism impairments having different etiologies and symptoms. In<br>
particular, the AGE-RAGE system is responsible for the deveppment of diabetic complications  related to vascular systems. AGEs<br>
(advanced glycation end products) are formed by a series of complex reactions following prolonged exposure of proteins or lipids to<br>
reducing sugars, for example glucose. The formation of AGEs takes place during the normal aging process and to an increased extent in<br>
diabetes mellits and Alzheimer's disease. Binding of AGEs leads! \o oxidative stress, activation of the NF-K-B transcription factor and thus<br>
an impairment of endothelial homeostasis.	j<br>
By "insulin resistance" there will be understood impaired signal jtensmission in various body cells, which ignore the physiological signal<br>
cascade of insulation. Affected patients therefore lack normal glucose metabolism.<br>
"Endothelium-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders" are disorders or conditions of a human or animal body that are caused by a<br>
defense response of the organism and its tissues to harmful stimuli, wherein certain signal molecules alter the properties of endothelial<br>
cells, with the result that, in interaction with the activation of oner cell types, leukocytes remain adhering to endothelial cells, finally<br>
penetrating into the tissue and causing inflammation therein. One example of endothelium-mediated inflammation is leukocytic vasculitis.<br>
A central role in activation of an endothelium-mediated inflammatory event is played by the NF-KB transcription factor. Another system<br>
leading to the development of endotheliaf cell-mediated chronic inflammations is the AGE- RAGE system.<br>
By "endotheliosis" there will be understood degenerative and proliferative endothelial changes during non-thrombopenic purpura. By<br>
"reticuloendotheliosis" there will be understood diseases of the reticulohistiocytrc system, such as reticulum, reticulosis,<br>
reticulohistiocytosis and Hand-SchuHer-Chfistian disease.	i<br>
By "Raynaud's disease" there will be understood episodically occuning ischemic states caused by vasoconstriction, or in other words<br>
vascular spasms, usually in the arteries of the fingers. Primary Raynaud's disease is a purely functional impairment of the small vessels<br>
supplying the distal parts of the extremities, whereas secondary Raynaud's disease accompanies another disease such as vascular<br>
inflammation,	h<br>
"Preeclampsia" is an endothelial and vascular disease of the aternal organism, apparently caused by endotheliotropic substances from<br>
the placenta. Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that may lead to functional impairments of numerous organs and be manifested by<br>
diverse symptoms. The circulatory impairments typical of the disorder result from increased vascular resistance, which can vary locally in<br>
severity. For preeclampsia it has been confirmed that an endothelial dysfunction is the central component of the pathogenesis.<br>
In connection with the present invention, by "renal failure" thera will be understood the restricted ability of the kidneys to excrete<br>
substances normally contained in the urine. In advanced stages, thsi ability to regulate the electrolyte, water and acid-base balance is also<br>
lost, Terminal renal failure is characterized by collapse of the excrelpry and endocrine function of the kidneys.<br>
According to the invention, renal failure may be acute renal failure, which is also referred to as acute renal insufficiency, shock kidney or<br>
shock aneuria. Acute renaf failure is characterized by sudden partial or total toss of the excretory function of the kidneys as a result of<br>
kidney damage that is usually reversible. The causes may be hypoperfusion due to hypovolemia, hypotension and dehydration resulting<br>
from blood losses (polytrauma, gastrointestinal or postpartum bleeding, major surgical procedures on the heart, vessels, abdomen or<br>
prostate), shock (myocardial infarction, embolism), serious infections (sepsis, peritonitis, cholecystitis), hemolysis (hemolytic-uremic<br>
syndrome.paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, transfusion reaction), myolysis (crush syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, bums), water and<br>
electrolyte losses (massive vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, fleus, acute pancreatitis). Further<br>
causes may be nephrotoxins such as exogenous toxins, for example aniline, gtycol compounds, methanol and the like, or endogenous<br>
toxins, for example myoglobin and oxalates, Further causes of |jacute renal failure are renal disorders, for example inflammatory<br>
nephropatrn'es or rejection reactions following kidney transplantation. Acute renal failure may also be caused by urinary retention<br>
following obstruction of the urine flow. The inventive treatment of acuje renal failure with erythropoietin, preferably in low doses, leads<br>
according to he invention to prevention or at (east diminution of the pnjgression of acute renal failure, According to the invention, renal<br>
failure may also be chronic renat failure. Causes of chronic renal failure are vascular, glomerular and tubulointerstitial kidney disorders,<br>
infections and congenital or acquired structural defects. Causes of chronic renal failure include chronic glomerulop athy, chronic<br>
pyelonephritis, analgesic nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. The terminal stage of chronic renal<br>
failure is uremia. The inventive treatment of chronic renal failure With low-dosage erythropoietin leads according to the invention to<br>
diminution of the progression of chronic renal failure.<br>
In particular, the invention therefore relates to the use of EPO, preferjably in low doses, for production of a drug for prevention, diminution<br>
or slowing of the damage to kidney tissue and/or for regeneration of imaged kidney tissue in cases of acute or chronic renal failure.<br>
According to the invention, there will be understood by renal funcflon restriction conditions in which the glomerular filtration rate has<br>
already slowed to less than 80 ml/min. Renal function restriction thetefdre relates to the early phase of glomerular, tubuointerstjtJal and<br>
vascular kidney disorders. The inventive treatment of renal function restrictions with low-dosage erythropoietin leads according to the<br>
invention to diminution of the progression or to regeneration of the beginning kidney tissue and/or function damage.<br><br>
In connection with the present invention, there will be understood byHmitroalbuminuria" a clinical picture in which affected patients exhibit unphysiological excretion of albumin in the urine in excess of 30 mg per 24 hours. This increased albumin excretion is an early sign of the beginning of renal function deterioration, and is a consequence [pf jthe first pathological transformation processes in the kidneys, accompanied by structural alterations of the kidney architecture.<br>
In connection with the present invention, there will be understood) by "proteinuria" a clinical picture in which affected patients exhibit unphysiological excretion of proteins in the urine in excess of 150 rrjjj per 24 hours. This increased protein excretion via the urine (&gt; 150 mg per 24 hours) is considered to be pathological, requiring further medical investigation and therapy.<br>
in connection with the present invention, there will be understood by if high ADMA levels" a clinical picture in which affected patients exhibit an unphysiologically high ADMA blood concentration En excess of 1.3 pmoi/!. This elevated ADMA concentration is associated with an endothelial dysfunction and is a consequence of metabolic dysfunctions in the processes of degradation and excretion of this molecule.<br>
In connection with the present invention, there will be understood! by "wound healing" the physiological processes for regeneration of destroyed tissue and for closing a wound, especially formation of r»sw connective tissue and capillaries. Wound healing may be primary wound healing (first intention healing), which in the case of a dear wound is characterized by rapid and complication-free closure and largely complete recovery, resulting from minimal formation of new pwective tissue between the wound edges, which have a good blood supply and have been approximated if necessary. In the case of wounds with wound edges that are further apart, especially crushed or necrotic wound edges, and of wound infections, delayed secondarVjwound healing (second intention healing) takes place. In such cases the tissue defect becomes filled with granulation tissue as a result of (a)bacterial inflammation, and scar tissue is formed more extensively. Epithelialization starting from the edge represents the completion of wound healing. Such wound and it takes place on the fourth to seventh day after the wound occurred. The repair phase begins jjn (he eighth day after the wound occurred, and is characterized by transformation of the granulation tissue into a scar.<br>
In connection with the present invention, there will be understood by a "wound" a break in the continuity of body tissues with or without loss of substance, caused by mechanical injury or physically related cell damage. Within the meaning of the present invention, a wound is also considered to be a disease. Types of wound are mechanical wounds, thermal wounds, chemical wounds, radiation- related wounds and disease-related wounds- Mechanical wounds are caused by external violence and occur in particular as cut and stab wounds, crushing, lacerating, tearing and abrading wounds, scratch and bite wounds and projectile wounds. Thermal wounds are caused by exposure to heat or cold. Chemical wounds are caused in particular by burning with acids or alkalis. Radiation-related wounds are caused, for example* by exposure to actinic and ionizing radiation. Wounjfc occurring in relation to disease are in particular congestion-related wounds, traumatic wounds, diabetic wounds etc According to the invention, it is provided in particular that low-dosage erythropoietin will be administered fo,r wound healing, preferably topically or intravenously.<br>

organ that has been damaged because of the dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells and/or endothelial cells, in order to induce local<br>
formation of new endothelium therein- In this way the damaged body regions, tissues and/or organs of the patient can be treated more<br>

According to the invention, the cell populations containing endothelial progenitor cells can be cultivated in vitro in the presence of at least one further active ingredient selected from the group comprising VEGF, PIGF, GM-CSF, an HMG- CoA reductase inhibitor, an ACE inhibitor, an AT-1 blocker and an NO donor. Preferably the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used for cultivation will be a statin such as simvastatin, mevastatin or atorvastatin, the ACE inhibitors will be substances such as enalapril, ramipril or trandolapril, and the AT-1 blocKer wif) be substances such as irbesartan, lorsartan or olmesaratan.<br>
According to the invention, cell populations containing endotheliat progenitor cells can be treated with sequential, timed successive or<br>
simultaneous administration of low- dosage erythropoietin as well as one or more other chemical, thermal, mechanical or biological<br>
agents, in order in this way to increase the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells and/or to bring about regeneration or<br>
slowing of the progression of tissue damage, A further preferred embojliment of the invention relates to a method for treatment of vascular<br>
disorders, comprising: a) isolation of cell populations containing endothelial progenitor cells from blood by means of density gradient<br>
centrifugation, b) cultivation of the ceil populations containing endothelial progenitor celhs in cell culture medium,<br>
c) cultivation of the cell populations containing endothelial progenitbr cells \v\ Ahe presence o1 erythropoietin in order to stimulate<br>
proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells and/or differentiation thereof to endothelial cells, d) isolation and purification of the<br>
differentiated endothelial cells, and e) transplantation of the endothelial cells Into a body with a vascular disorder, After transplantation of<br>
the endothelial cells into the body with a vascular disorder, such a body can be further treated with erythropoietin, especially in the tow<br>
doses according to the invention, or in other words the doses defined in the section entitled "Inventive dosing of EPO", for example of<br>
0.001 to 90 units/kg/week or of 20 lU/week to 2000 lU/week.	j<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to cultivate the cell populations containing endothefial progenitor cells in the presence of at least one further active ingredient selected from the group comprising VEGF PIGF, GM-CSF, an ACE inhibitor, an A"M blocker and/or an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Preferably the ACE inhibitor used for olivaition will be substances such as enalapril, ramipril ortrandoiapril, and the AT-1 blocker used for cultivation will be substances such as rbesartan, lorsartan or otmesaratan, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used for cultivation will be a statin such as simvastatin, mevastatin or atorvastatin. According to the invention, cell populations containing endothelial progenitor cells can be treated with sequentia timed successive or simultaneous administration of low- dosage ©rythropoietin as well as one or more other chemical, thermal, mechan pal or biological agents, in order in this way to increase the number and function of endothelial progenitor cetis and/or to bring about regeneration or slowing of the progression of tissue damage. Such mechanical agents can be endoprostheses, preferably implantatiojji supports for teeth, bones or ligament/tendon replacements.<br>
13<br><br>
Furthermore, the biological agents can be solid organs such as liverjkidheys, heart, pancreas or skin, or even hair implants. The invention therefore provides that EPO, especially in low doses, will be used so that mechanical agents such as endoprostheses or biological agents implanted simultaneously, subsequently or beforehand can grow or be integrated better, faster and more efficiently into the surrounding body structure. The invention therefore also relates to the use of erythropoietin for production of a pharmaceutical composition or of a kit for improving, especially for promoting and/oif accelerating, integration of biological agents or endoprostheses into surrounding body structures, especially of teeth, tooth replacements tooth implants or other endoprostheses, such as bone replacements, bone implants, especially hip joint prostheses or ligament/tendon replacements, such as cruciate ligaments. In a preferred embodiment, it can then be provided that the erythropoietin will be used together Jith cell populations suitable for cell therapy and/or endothelial progenitor cells. In the aforesaid use of erythropoietin for production of a pharmaceutical composition or of a kit for improving, especially for promoting and/or accelerating, integration of biological or mecnan cal agents into target structures, especially target tissue, target bones or target cartilage of a patient, it can be provided in a further preferred embodiment that the mechanical agents to be used are made, for example, of steel, ceramic, plastic or another material. In addition, it can be provided that osteoblasts, cells having osteogenic potential, thrombocytes, blood cells or similar agents can be used in the present application as cell populations suitable for cell therapy. In a further preferred embodiment, it can be provided that the mechanical agent in particular to be used will be contained in the pharmaceutical composition or in the pharmaceutical kit together with organic adhesive, such as a fibrin glue. The inventive method for treatment of vascular disorders thus provides that endothelial progenitor cells wilt be isolated from the blood of a human organism, expanded in vitro using low-dosage erythropoietin and differentiated to endothefial cells, after which the differentiated endothelial cells or the endothelial progenitor ceils undergoing differentiation will be purified and isolated, then transplanted selectively into a damaged blood vessel or an ischemic region, in order to induce local neovascularization therein. In this way damaged blood vessels or ischemic tissues can be treated more selectively and rapidly. The inventive method for treatment of vascular disorders is suitable in particular for treatment of vascular disorders such as ischemia, especially cerebral ischemia, ischemic disorders of the extremities, stroke, acute arterial occlusion, arterial occlusive disease, Raynaud's disease and ergotism, Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are specified in the dependent claims. The invention will be explained in more detail on the basis of the figures and examples hereinafter. Fig. 1 shows the results of a FACS analysis of circulating CD34+ stem cells (cSC). (A-D): patients' samples; (E-F): isotype controls. cSC were identified by means of the additional expression of the CD34 marker (B and F), by means of the characteristic tow to moderate CD45 antigen expression (C and G) and by means of the characteristic ijghlj scattering properties (D and H). The absolute cSC number was calculated per 100,000 monocytes and lymphocytes.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a quantitative assay of circulating stem cells by means ui nuw cytometry. The figure shows the time- dependent effect of erythropoietin treatment using rhEPO (recombinant human erythropoietin) after 0, 2,4, 6 and 8 weeks, n -11, the values correspond to mean values + standard deviation. Medians are shown by lines.<br>
*: p 
shown is the course over 9 week$ and all the controls. The absolute values are shown on the one hand as individual values, in addition, box plots are presented (90th/75th/50th/25th and 10th percentiles as well as the mean value). Subjects of matched age and sex in whom EPCs were isolated and characterized analogously (n -11) served as healthy control.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the quantitative assay of cultivated endothelial progMor cells (EPC) in healthy young subjects. The figure shows that treatment with rhEPO (30IU of epoetin beta per kg of body weight m week) increases the relative number of EPCs. EPCs were isolated before the treatment of the subjects with rhEPO as well as weekW at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 weeks after treatment of the patients with rhEPO. And were characterized by means of their adhesion ability and the two markers acLDL-Dil and UEA-1 FITC. n A 4, the values correspond to mean values ± standard deviation.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a quantitative assay of cultivated endothelial progenitoi icells (EPC). The representative photographs show that the absolute number of EPCs in uremic patients is significantly reduced comparod with healthy subjects of matched age and sex (top row = in vivo). Patients with restricted renal function therefore exhibit distinct EPC dysfunction compared with control subjects. If endothelial progenitor cells of a healthy subject are cocultivated with serum of uremic patiehtsl the differentiation ability of his or her endothelial progenitor cells is reduced (bottom row = in vitro). Thus restricted renaf function] wiljh uremia derived therefrom leads to dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a quantitative assay of cultivated endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in 46 uremic patients with restricted renal function versus 46 subjects of matched age and sex, presented in the form of box frfojs (90th/75th/50th/25th and 10th percentiles as well as the mean value). The number of endothelial progenitor cells in the uremic patients is significantly reduced compared with the healthy subjects. Patients with restricted renal function therefore exhibit distinct EPC disfunction compared with control subjects, Fig. 8 shows the effect of erythropoietin on wound healing. The figun£ snows that, when a standardized skin wound inflicted on mice using a tissue punch was treated with erythropoietin, it already closed completely after seven to eight days. In contrast, when, the wound was treated with physiological salt solution (saline), it did not closej completely until after thirteen to fourteen days. Treatment with erythropoietin or physiological salt solution began 7 days before M skin wound was inflicted. Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered one time per week by s.c. (subcutaneous) injection (0.1 W/kg Aranesp) (n = 5 in each group),<br>
1|4<br><br>
Fig. 9 shows that erythropoietin reduces the toss of renal function after aWe renal failure (acute renal insufficiency). Sprague Dawley rats<br>
(250 to 300 g) were included in the study. The rats were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and Rompun (10 mg/kg). One of the<br>
experimental groups received 0.1 p-g of Aranesp per kg of body weiht one time on the day before induction of the acute renal failure. For<br>
comparison, there was used a group of experimental animals, each of which was given an s.c.injection of saline at the same time. By<br>
application of an arterial clamp to the right renal arteries, the blood ftow into the kidney was interrupted for 45 minutes. During this period,<br>
a left nephrectomy was performed. A sham operation was performed on a further control group. In this procedure, the abdomen was<br>
opened to expose the left renal artery, but the blood supply was Unt interrupted and the contralateral Right kidney was removed. All<br>
animals were anesthetized for 60 min and killed 24 h after the operation. In the animals treated with saline, the 45-minute ischemia with<br>
subsequent reperfusion of the remaining right kidney led to massive acute loss of renal function. This is reflected by the fact that the<br>
serum creatinine level 24 h after ischemia and reperfusion was 7 timps higher than the level before ischemia and reperfusion (p 
contrast, the animals treated with the erythropoietin analog Aranesp exhibited only a four-fold increase in the serum creatinine levels one<br>
day after induction of damage by ischemia and reperfusion. No increase in retention levels was found in the animals subjected to left<br>
nephrectomy and a sham operation on the right kidney. The figure shows the creatinine concentration in the serum of EPO-treated<br>
animals (IR+EPO), Nad-treated animals (IR) and sham-operated anjjnaK (sham OP) before ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and 24 hours<br>
thereafter. It is evident from the figure that the serum creatinEne concentration 24 hours after ischemia-reperfusion injury is almost halved<br>
in the animals treated with Aranesp compared with the control without Aranesp (NaCI treatment).<br>
Fig. 10 shows the Kaplan-Mayer survival curves of two experimental groups treated either with Aranesp or NaCI after induction uf chrome<br>
renal failure. 8-week old Sprague Dawley rats were included in the study. The rats were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and<br>
Rompun (10 mg/kg). Their right kidney was removed on day 0 anq was immediatefy fixed in formalin for histological examination. The<br>
segmental arteries supplying the upper and lower renal poles of the left kidney were ligated. Thereby renal infarction occurred in the<br>
corresponding kidney areas, and only the middle third of the kidney remained functional. One time per week, the rats received Aranesp<br>
(0.1 M-9*9 A body weight) or NaCi by s.c. injection. The animals treated with the erythropoietin analog Aranesp exhibited a significant<br>
survival advantage compared with the animals treated with saline (pffO-027; log rank test).<br>
For the two experimental groups that were treated either with Aranesp or NaCI and whose Kaplan-Mayer survival curves are illustrated in<br>

Effect of EPO in patients with renal anemia The effect of erythropoietin in patients with renal anemia (Hb 
renal disease in the terminal stage (preterminal renal failure; creatin me clearance 
intravenously or subcutaneously with erythropoietin in weekly doses; averaging 5000IU of rhEPO (recombinant human erythropoietin) tor<br>
a period of at least 8 weeks. After erythropoietin treatment, the endothelial progenitor cells in the blood of the patients were investigated<br>
over a period of 20 weeks, the endothelial progenitor cells being] analyzed with regard to number and differentiation status by flow<br>
cytometry and a culture test after 0,2,4,6 and 8 weeks.<br>
Circulating peripheral blood stem cells (CPBSC) represent a small population of cells that express both the CD34 antigen and the CD45<br>
antigen. A test based on the ISHAGE guidelines has been developed to determine the number of CPBSC by flow cytometry (Sutherland et<br>
al., J. Hematother, 5 (1996), 213-226). Using this test, both the expression pattern of CD34 and CD45 cells and the morphology of the<br>
stem cells were determined. In this way, both the absolute number of pPBSC per JJ and the content of CPBSC as a percentage of the<br>
total leukocyte count were determined.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the results of an FACS analysis of circulating CD34+ stJBm bells on the basis of the ISHAGE buidelines.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the number of CD34+ stem cells measured by FACS aijijalyjsis over a period of 8 weeks.<br>
Cell culture test<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficolj density centrifugation from human b cod samples in accordance with<br>
the method described in Asahara, Science, 275 (1997). 964-967. Tne cells were plated out on culture plates with fibronectin and<br>
maintained in EC basal medium. EC basal medium consists of EBM-2 basal medium (Clonetics Co.) an i EGM-2 Quots (hEGF; GA-100<br>
(gentamicin,   amphotericin-B)   FBS,   VEGF,   hFGF-B (w/heparin), R3-IGP-1, ascorbic acid, hepain). After 4 days of cultivation,<br>
nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plates. The remaining adherent cells were treated with trypsin and plated out once again.<br>
Thereafter they were cultivated for a further 3 days. Cells with th# endothelial phenotype were identiled by positive staining for two<br>
different endothelial markers on day 7 after isolation. These<br>
are DiMabeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL-Dit) and Ul$x europaeus aglutinin-1 (UEA-1). Th|e results of this investigation are<br>
presented in Fig. 3.	|<br>
The results show that erythropoietin is able to mobilize endothelial proc enitor cells and to increase the itiumber of circulating endothelial<br>
progenitor cells. In the process, functional deficits that occur in certain pathological states such as renal anemia are compensated. These<br>
results are	j<br>
presented in Fig. 4, By means of flow cytometry it was found that thelhurnber of circulating CD34+ stem a ills in patients with renal disease<br>
in the terminal stage corresponds to the number of circulating CD34+ stem cells in the blood of healthy subjects. After the erythropoietin<br>
treatment is started, the number of CD34+ stem cells in the bloodstream increases significantly by more than 50%. By using the cell<br>
culture assay, it was determined that, after treatment with erythropoietin, the number of cells that develop an   endothelial  phenotype<br>
increases dramatically. In one functional cell culture test, the greatly impaired ability of endothelial progen tor cells increased by a factor of<br>
greater than 3.<br>
Example 2<br>
Improved wound heating through systemic use of rhEPO FVB/N mice were anesthetized by inhalation anesthesia with isoflorane. The fur<br>
on the two rear limbs was removed using a depilatory lotion and disinfected with 70% alcohol. A sterile 4 mm disposable biopsy tissue<br>
punch was used to inflict a skin wound on the right flank of each of the mice. The opposite side served a s internal control. Postoperative<br>
antibiotic cover with penicillin G (20,000 units/kg) was administered one time. Throughout the entire period of investigation, subcutaneous<br>
injections of the recombinant human erythropoietin analog Aranesp (0,1 ug/kg of body weight) were applied one time per week throughout<br>
the entire study period. The treatment began seven days before removal of the tissue punch. The results are presented in Fig. 8. They<br>
show that administration of EPO considerably accelerates the woundlpealing process. Fig. 19 shows the 6 ffect of erythropoietin on wound<br>
healing. The figure shows that, when a standardized skin wound inflicted on mice using a tissue punch was treated with low-dosage<br>
erythropoietin (20 ID EPO/kg/week), it already closed completely aftejf seven to eight days. In contrast, when the wound was treated with<br>
physiological salt solution (saline), it did not close completely until after thirteen to fourteen days. Ir the case of treatment of the<br>
experimental animals with high-dosage erythropoietin  (200  IU  BPO/kg/week),  no acceleration of wound healing could be observed<br>
by comparison with the control group. Two of the experimental;animals treated with high-dosage erythropoietin died during the<br>
observation period. The treatment with erythropoietin or physiological salj solution began on the day of the operation, after the skin wound<br>
was inflicted. Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered erne lime per week by s.c. (subcutaneous) injection (20 lU/kg EPO or<br>
200IU/kgEPO)(n = 5ineachgroup).	'	I<br>

Reduction in the progression of chronic renal failure through erifthilopoietin treatment Ekjht-week-clld Sprague-Dawley rats were<br>
anesthetized with Ketamine (120 mg/kg) and Rompun (10 mg/kg). Thfiir right kidney was removed on day 0 and was immediately fixed in<br>
formalin for histological examination. The segmental arteries supplymg the upper and lower renal poles of the left kidney were ligated.<br>
Thereby renal infarction occurred in the corresponding kidney areas, ghd only the middle third of the kidnej' remained functional. One time<br>
per week, the rats received the erythropoietin analog Aranesp in a dtjse of 0.1 M.g/kg of body weight or h aCI by s.c. injection for control<br>
purposes.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the Kaplan-Mayer survival curves for both experimental grpups. The animals treated with Aitanesp have distinctly improved<br>
survival compared with the control animals treated with saline.<br>
Figs. 15 to 18 show that the renal tissue exhibits no pathological changed after treatment with erythropoietic whereas severe pathological<br>
changes are visible after treatment with NaCI (compare with Figs. 8 to[fl1). Further<br>
histotogical investigations revealed that a distinctly greater vessel density (CD31) can be observed in animals treated with Aranesp than in<br>
animals treated with saline (data not shown).	'<br>

Example 4<br>
Reduction in the progression of acute renal failure Sprague-Dawley rats with a body weight of 250 to 300 g were used for this investigation. One of the experimental groups received Aranesp in a dose of 0.1 ,ag/kg of body wsight one time on the day before induction of acute renal failure. The rats were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg of body weight) and Rompun (10 mg/kg). For comparison, there was used a group of experimental animals, eeioh af which was given an s.c. injection of saline at the same time. By application of an arterial clamp to the right renal artery, the blood flow into the kidney was interrupted for 45 minutes. During this period, a left nephrectomy was performed. A sham operation was performed on a further control group. In this procedure, the abdomen was opened to expose the left renal artery, but the blood supply was not interrupted and the contralateral right kkJn|ey was removed. All animals were anesthetized for 60 min and killed 24 h after the operation.<br>
En the animals treated with saline, the 45-minute ischemia with subsequent reperfusion of the remaining right kidney led to massive acute loss of renal function. This is reflected by the fact that the serum creatinine level increased by a factor of 7 (p 
Reduced differentiation ability of endothelial progenitor cells in patients with restricted renal function The differentiation status of endothelial progenitor cells was analyzed by a culture test in 46 uremic patients as well as 46 healthy o jntrol subjects of matched age and sex. It was surprisingly found that the number of endothelial progenitor cells in this differentiation assa/ is significantly reduced in uremic patients compared with the healthy controls (Fig. 7). If mononuclear cells of a healthy subject are isolate d and cultivated in the presence of serum of a uremic patient, the ability of these cells to differentiate to endothelial progenitor cells is reduqed analogously (Fig. 6). Example 6<br>
Stimulation of the differentiation ability of endothelial progenitor celts in healthy subjects Four healthy ydung males were treated with 30IU of epoetin beta per kilogram of body weight one time per week for a period of 8 weeks. The differentiation ability of their endothelial progenitor cells was determined in a culture assay, based on their adhesion ability and the two markers acLDL and UEA, before treatment of the subjects with rhEPO as well as weekly at 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 weeks after treatment of the subje rts with rhEPO. A relative increase of greater than 50% was observed in the EPCs.<br>
