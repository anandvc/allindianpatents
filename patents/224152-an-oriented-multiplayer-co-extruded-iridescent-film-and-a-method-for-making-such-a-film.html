				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to films that posses an adequate level of elastic<br>
memory activated through the application of heat energy which can be utilized in<br>
a variety of packaging applications, such as shrink labels and decorative shrink<br>
wrap . Hereinafter, such film will sometimes be referred to as "shrink film".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The customary films used for this purpose are made of polyvinyl alcohol, glycol<br>
modified polyethylene terephthalate made from ethylene, glycol and<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol and terephthalic acid and polypropylene structures,<br>
depending on the degree of desired shrinkage required and the particular<br>
application. It has been possible to obtain shrinkages of up to 50 or 60%. Often<br>
the shrink film is preformed into a tube and then cut into the appropriate size for<br>
application to a container or some other object. It is frequently desirable for the<br>
film to shrink around the object in such a manner that it conforms exactly to the<br>
shape of that object.<br>
Multilayer coextruded light reflecting films which have a narrow reflection band<br>
due to light interference are known. When that reflection band occurs in the<br>
range of visible wavelengths, the film appears iridescent. It would be desirable to<br>
employ such iridescent films as shrink film for shrink packaging applications but it<br>
has not been possible to achieve that object heretofore.<br>
The multilayer coextruded iridescent films are composed of a plurality of<br>
generally parallel layers of transparent thermoplastic resinous material in which<br>
the contiguous adjacent layers are of diverse resinous material whose index of<br>
refraction differs by at least about 0.03 . These films contain at least 10 layers,<br>
but are more usually composed of at least 35 and preferably at least about 70<br>
layers.<br>
Commercially available films often contain between 50 and 100 repeating pairs of<br>
polymers, which generate the optical effect known as iridescence. Each of the<br>
individual layers is very thin and is usually on the order of about 30-500mm. The<br>
quality of a iridescent multilayer coextruded film is dependent on the individual<br>
layers being, and remaining, generally parallel and of substantial uniform<br>
thickness. Deviations from these requirements interfere with the desired optical<br>
effect.<br>
The traditional multilayer coextruded iridescent films possessed a minor degree<br>
of elastic memory and will shrink somewhat when exposed to heat. However, the<br>
amount of shrinkage of which these films are capable is not sufficient for us of<br>
the films for shrink packaging applications and is also accompanied by changes<br>
in the optical characteristics of the individual layers so that the iridescence is'<br>
altered or lost and/or the interlayer bonds between joining layers are disturbed<br>
leading to internal delamination or separation of the layers.<br>
Efforts have been made in the past to improve the mechanical properties of the<br>
multilayer coextruded light reflecting films, although not for the purpose of<br>
achieving a shrink film. U.S.Patent 4,310,584 describes the use of thermoplastic<br>
terephthalate polyester or copolyester resins as one component of the two<br>
adjacent polymer films and another improvement is described in U.S.Patent<br>
5,089,318 in which a thermoplastic elastomer is employed as one of the resinous<br>
material. Despite these improvements, the films still have inadequate mechanical<br>
and optical properties for shrink packaging applications when compared to<br>
conventional film structures.<br>
US Patent number US 5149578 discloses a multilayer film including contiguous<br>
layers of two or more diverse thermoplastic materials of differing refractive<br>
indices whereby the film retains a permanent color change as evidence of<br>
tampering or an attempt at tampering when the yield point of at least one of the<br>
diverse materials has been at least equalled by the strain associated with such<br>
tampering or with such an attempt at tampering, and where before such yield<br>
point is at least equalled the wavelength of an unsuppressed reflectance of<br>
normally incident light is not within the visible spectrum while after such yielded<br>
point is at least equalled the reflectance is retained in the visible spectrum.<br>
US-5089318 discloses a method and system for improvements in multilayer light<br>
reflecting film which is effected by the use of a thermoplastic elastomer resin in a<br>
system in which two or more resinous materials form a plurality of the layers.<br>
It is now been discovered that by appropriately selecting the different<br>
thermoplastic resinous materials and by orienting the coextruded film made from<br>
the selected materials, a shrinkable iridescent film having acceptable properties<br>
can be achieved.<br>
It is accordingly the object of the present invention to provide a shrinksble<br>
iridescent film suitable for shrink packaging application. This and other objects of<br>
the invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art of the<br>
following detailed description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a shrinkable iridescent film suitable for shrink packaging<br>
applications and to the method for the production of that film. More particularly,<br>
a shrinkable iridescent multilayered coextruded film composed of at least 10<br>
generally parallel, very thin layers of substantially uniform thickness with<br>
the contiguous adjacent layers being of different heat shrinkable thermoplastic<br>
resinous materials, each of the materials being heat shrinkable at least one dimension<br>
in an amount of at least 10% in response to applied heat, the coextruded contiguous<br>
adjacent layers being substantially uniformly shrinkable in response to applied heat<br>
 so as to have refractive indices which differ by at least about 0.03 after the shrinkage<br>
to produce an optical effect. The film is made by selecting the appropriate<br>
thermoplastic resinous materials, coextruding them into a relatively thick film,<br>
followed by orientating the film at a temperature using temperature profiles to<br>
achieve the desired color and shrink properties.<br>
 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a shrinkable iridescent multilayer<br>
coextruded film is produced by varying the conventional production process with<br>
respect to the selection of the resinous materials employed, the thickness of the film<br>
coextruded, and by imparting elastic memory to the film by orientation.<br>
 Multilayer coextruded iridescent film per se is known in the art. It is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. Re 31,780 to Cooper, Shetty and Pinksy and U.S.<br>
Patents 5,089,318 and 5,451,449, both to Shetty and Cooper, all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference, and in other patents. The iridescent film is, as there<br>
described, a transparent thermoplastic resinous coextruded laminated film of at least<br>
 10 very thin layers, preferably at least about 35 layers and more preferably at least<br>
about 70 layers, each of which is usually in the range of about 30-500 nm and more<br>
preferably about 50-400 nm, with the layers being generally parallel and the<br>
contiguous adjacent layers being of different transparent thermoplastic resinous<br>
materials differing in refractive index by at least about 0.03, and more preferably, at<br>
 least about 0.06. The outermost layers of the film constituting a skin, when present,<br>
are each at least about 5% of the total thickness of the film.<br>
The thermoplastic resinous materials used in the present invention are<br>
required to meet several characteristics. First, when formed into a thin film having a<br>
thickness of about 12-150 urn, preferably about 15-75 mm, the film must be heat-<br>
 shrinkable in one or more of the dimensions lying in the plane of the film in an<br>
amount of at least 10%, preferably at least about 20%, and more preferably about 40-<br>
50%, in response to the application of heat of about 70-300 °C. Preferably, the<br>
resinous material as a film is heat shrinkable in all directions in the plane of the film<br>
in a degree which is substantially the same throughout. Second, the resinous<br>
 materials must also, when formed into contiguous adjacent film layers, shrink at a<br>
rate which is substantially uniform throughout the layers. The rate of shrinkage in<br>
different dimensions in the plane of the film need not be the same, but the rate for<br>
any given dimension should be substantially the same for both contiguous layers.<br>
For example, the longitudinal shrinkage can be different than the transverse<br>
 shrinkage as long as both longitudinal shrinkage rates and both transverse shrinkage<br>
rates are substantially the same. Finally, the resinous materials must be selected such<br>
mat the refractive indices after shrinking differ by at least about 0.03, and preferably<br>
at least about 0.06. The refractive indexes need not differ by these values before<br>
orientation because orientation can alter the index of refraction of a given layer and<br>
 therefore orientation of two layers whose indices differ by less than 0.03 before<br>
orientation can result in a difference which exceeds 0.03 after orientation. In most<br>
instances, the difference in indices of refraction after orientation but before shrinkage<br>
and that after shrinkage will be approximately the same.<br>
Any of the thermoplastic resinous material used to prepare iridescent film<br>
 heretofore can be used in the present invention as long as the individual materials<br>
have the characteristics set forth above and likewise, the combination of selected<br>
resinous materials has the characteristics detailed above. Typical non-limiting<br>
examples of usable combinations include polystyrene and ethylene vinyl acetate,<br>
polystyrene and polyethylene, PETG-copolyester (a glycol modified polyethylene<br>
 terephthalate made from ethylene glycol and cyclohexamedimethanol) and acrylic,<br>
and PETG-polyester and ethylene vinyl acetate.<br>
The selected resinous materials are made into a multilayer film using<br>
convention technology modified such that each ply of the film is thicker in order to<br>
allow for thickness reduction during orientation. For example, the films can be made<br>
 by a chill-roll casting technique using a conventional single manifold flat film die in<br>
combination with a feedblock which collects the melts from each of two or more<br>
extruders and arranges them into the desired layer pattern. Suitable feedblocks are<br>
described, for instance, in U.S. Patent Number 3,565,985 and 3,773,882. The<br>
feedblocks can be used to form alternating layers of either two components (i.e.<br>
ABAB...); three components (ABCABCA... or ACBACBC.) or more. The very<br>
 narrow multilayer stream flows through a single manifold flat film die where the<br>
layers are simultaneously spread to the width of the die and thinned to the final die<br>
exit thickness. The number of layers and their thickness distribution can be changed<br>
by inserting a different feedblock module. Usually, the outermost layer or layers on<br>
each side of the sheet are thicker than the other layers. The thicker skin may consist<br>
 of one the components which makes up the optical core or may be a different<br>
polymer which is utilized to impart desirable mechanical, heat-sealing or other<br>
properties.<br>
Any conventional process of orientation of films can be employed in the<br>
process of the present invention as long as the substantially uniform thickness and<br>
 parallel orientation of the layers is maintained. The orientation may be uniaxial or<br>
multiaxial. For example, the film can be stretched by tension applied in the required<br>
direction and the stretching may occur between a cooling roll and a take-up unit, with<br>
the tension applied by draw rolls or a combination of draw rolls.<br>
Another process which can be used to affect orientation is compression<br>
 rolling. Here, the multilayer film is passed between rollers positioned so as to<br>
decrease the thickness to about 20-50% of the original multilayer film thickness. A<br>
lubricant is used on the film as it passes through the nip between the two rolls, and<br>
this can be applied directly to the film or to the roller surface so that it is transferred<br>
to the surface of the film as it passes between the rollers. The lubricant can be any<br>
 liquid or material which acts as a liquid in the area where the pressure from the rolls<br>
is applied to the film. It acts to form a full or partial fluid film between the roll and<br>
the film so that the roll surface and the film surface are separated by the liquid<br>
lubricant thereby preventing contact and increasing mobility as the laminate enters a<br>
nip. Water can be used as a lubricant and it is also desirable to include a surfactant<br>
 within the water.<br>
During orientation, the film being oriented is usually heated to a temperature<br>
which is below the crystalline melting point of the resinous materials by roll contact<br>
and/or air. The processing temperature will depend on the particular iridescent sheet<br>
being oriented and can range from about ambient up to about 145 ° C. or more.<br>
 Orientation imparts elastic memory to the resinous film so that it will shrink upon<br>
application of heat. Heat setting, or constrained high-temperature annealing, is<br>
required to regulate the activation range of the particular iridescent shrink film. If the<br>
heat set temperature of the resinous materials is exceeded, the film of that material<br>
will not shrink as desired.<br>
 Various examples are given below in order to illustrate the present invention.<br>
In those examples, as throughout this specification and claims, all parts and<br>
percentages are by weight, and all temperatures in °C unless otherwise specified.<br>
Example 1<br>
Polystyrene and ethylene vinyl acetate were selected for use as the<br>
 thermoplastic resinous materials. The resinous materials were coextruded to prepare<br>
a film sample with an optical core containing approximately 100 alternating layers in<br>
dimensions suitable for subsequent stretch orientation to a pre-determined thickness.<br>
The surface layer in the sample was a polyolefin. The coextruded film was produced<br>
in thicknesses ranging from 35 to 70 mm and exhibited virtually no reflected color.<br>
 The colorless extruded film was then processed using a two stage Marshall-<br>
Williams equipment and stretched at various orientation temperatures ranging from<br>
110-115 ° C. The effective draw ratios varied from 1.8 to 2.6:1 and a predetermined<br>
ultimate gauge within the range of 12 to 25 mm was employed. Iridescence<br>
developed as a result of the orientation. Color measurements were taken across the<br>
 web to determine the uniformity of the iridescent color which had developed. There<br>
was no indication of non-uniform draw of the individual microlayers in the plane<br>
perpendicular to the moving web.<br>
A sample of the oriented multilayer film wrapped around a glass bottle was<br>
exposed to a hot air stream at a temperature of 200 °C for 5 seconds. Uniform<br>
 iridescence was observed in the film even though it shrank by about 15 % in the<br>
orientation direction, conforming to the contour of the glass bottle. Similar results<br>
were obtained by placing the glass bottle in an oven at 225 °C for 5 minutes.<br>
Example 2<br>
Co-polyester and polymethylmethacryate were coextruded to prepare a film<br>
 sample with an optical core containing approximately 200 alternating layers in<br>
dimensions suitable for subsequent stretch orientation to a pre-determined thickness.<br>
The surface layer in the sample was copolyester. The coextruded film was produced<br>
in thicknesses ranging from 40 to 120 mm and exhibited virtually no reflected color.<br>
The colorless extruded film was then processed using a single stage Marshall-<br>
 Williams MDO and stretched at various orientation temperatures ranging from 80-<br>
125° C. The effective draw ratios varied from 1.8 to 3.5:1 and a predetermined<br>
ultimate gauge within the range of 25 to 40 mm was employed. Iridescence<br>
developed as a result of the orientation. Color measurements were taken across the<br>
web to determine the uniformity of the iridescent color which had developed. There<br>
 was no indication of non-uniform draw of the individual micro layers in the plane<br>
perpendicular to the moving web.<br>
A sample of the oriented multilayer film wrapped around a glass bottle was<br>
exposed to a hot air stream at a temperature of 200°C for 5 seconds. Uniform<br>
iridescence was observed in the film even though it shrank by about 25 % in the<br>
 orientation direction, conforming to the contour of the glass bottle. Similar results<br>
were obtained by placing the glass bottle in an oven at 225 °C for 5 minutes and<br>
175°C for 3 minutes.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 2 is repeated except that the co-polyester is coextruded with<br>
 ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer to prepare a film having about 100 and 200 layers<br>
in the optical core and a thickness of the total film of between 75 to 100 urn. The<br>
film is processed via biaxial orientation in stretch ratios ranging from 2:1 up to 5:1 or<br>
more. The resulting films possesses iridescent properties which are retained when<br>
exposed to thermal energy which induces shrinkage between 15-50%.<br>
Example 4<br>
Example 3 is repeated except that the coextruded film has about 200 layers in<br>
the optical core and a thickness of the total film of between 125 to 300 urn.<br>
Various changes and modifications can be made in the process and products<br>
 of this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. For example,<br>
incorporation of dyes, pigments and processing aids into any of the polymer streams<br>
is an obvious extension of the targeted optical effects. Ultimate film thickness prior<br>
to shrink can be adjusted to virtually any practical film or sheet dimension. The film<br>
could also be surface coated or laminated to another material. The various<br>
 embodiments which have been disclosed herein for the purpose of illustrating the<br>
invention only and were not intended to limit it.<br>

claimed in claim 10, wherein said pair of thermoplastic resinous materials<br>
are selected are heat shrinkable in at least one dimension in the plane of<br>
the film in an amount of about 40-50% in response to applied heat in the<br>
range of about 70-300°C, and the pair are coextruded into a film<br>
comprising at least 70 generally parallel, very thin layers of about 30-500<br>
mm each.<br>
17. A method of making an oriented multilayer co-extruded iridescent film as<br>
claimed in claim 16, wherein said coextruded film thickness is about 30 to<br>
375 mm and is reduced to about 15 to 75 mm.<br>
18. A method of making an oriented multilayer co-extruded iridescent film as<br>
claimed in claim 10, wherein said coextruded film thickness is about 30 to<br>
375 urn and is reduced to about 15 to 75 mm.<br>
This invention relates to a shrinkable iridescent film constitutes an oriented<br>
multiplayer coextruded iridescent film having at least 10 generally parallel, very<br>
thin layers of substantially uniform thickness in which the contiguous adjacent<br>
layers are of heat shrinkable thermoplastic resinous material, each of which is<br>
heat shrinkable in at least one dimension in the plane of the film, the continuous<br>
adjacent layers being substantially uniformly shrinkable so as to have refractive<br>
indexes which differ by at least 0.03. The shrinkable film is made by selecting<br>
appropriate thermoplastic resinous materials, coextruding them into a thick film<br>
and then subjecting the film to orientation below the heat set temperature of the<br>
resinous materials.</td>
