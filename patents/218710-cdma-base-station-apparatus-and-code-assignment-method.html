				<td>CDMA BASE STATION APPARATUS AND<br>
CODE ASSIGNMENT METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a base station<br>
apparatus used in a CDMA-based radio communication<br>
system and its code assignment method.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A CDMA-based base station apparatus (hereinafter<br>
simply referred to as "base station") presets code<br>
specification information specific to each apparatus,<br>
generates codes based on this code specification<br>
information and transmits signals multiplied by those<br>
codes. The code specification information is code phase<br>
for a PN code, etc. and code type for a Walsh code, etc.<br>
In a conventional method of assigning codes to base<br>
stations, code specification information is fixedly<br>
assigned through advance theoretical design to base<br>
stations preventing them from interfering with one<br>
another.<br>
However, if a new base station is added, the<br>
conventional method of assigning codes to base stations<br>
above has a problem of having the necessity of repeating<br>
theoretical design to assign codes to all base stations<br>
once again.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It Is an objective of the present invention to<br>
provide a CDMA base station apparatus and code assignment<br>
method that will not require theoretical design to assign<br>
codes to all base stations even if a new base station<br>
is added.<br>
The present invention achieves the objective above<br>
by reading stored code specification information and<br>
measuring its interference level, selecting code<br>
specification information whose interference level is<br>
smaller than a preset threshold as its own code<br>
information candidate and determining the code<br>
specification information of the station from the<br>
selected code specification information.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference now to the attached drawings, the<br>
embodiments of the present invention are explained in<br>
detail below. In the explanations below, code type is<br>
used as code specification information.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG.l is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a base station in Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br><br>
Base station l in FIG.1 mainly comprises<br>
transmission/reception section 20 that<br>
transmits/receives signals to/from a mobile station and<br>
receives a signal transmitted from another base station<br>
via antenna 10, interference level measuring section 30<br>
that measures the interference level of a signal received<br>
by transmission/reception section 20 and code assignment<br>
control section 40 that performs code type assignment<br>
control based on the measured interference level.<br>
Code assignment control section 40 comprises<br>
memory 41 that stores code types and memory 41 comprises<br>
all code list 42 that stores all code types in a list<br>
form and candidate code list 43 that stores code types<br>
to be assignment candidates in a list form.<br>
Code assignment control section 40 also comprises<br>
code reading section 44 that reads code types from all<br>
code list 42 and outputs them to interference level<br>
measuring section 30, threshold determination section<br>
45 that determines a code type to be an assignment<br>
candidate based on the interference level input from<br>
interference level measuring section 30 and a preset<br>
threshold and writes the code type to be an assignment<br>
candidate to candidate code list 43 and code<br>
determination section 46 that determines the code type<br>
of the station to be used from candidate code list 43<br>
and outputs it to transmission/reception section 20.<br>
Interference level measuring section 30 comprises<br>
code generation section 31 that generates codes based<br>
on a code type input from code reading section 44,<br>
despreading section 32 that despreads a received signal<br>
multiplied by a code and level calculation section 33<br>
that calculates the interference level of the despread<br>
signal.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of base station<br>
1 in Embodiment 1 is explained using a flow diagram in<br>
FIG.2.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as candidate<br>
code list 43 are initialized (ST201), and code reading<br>
section 44 reads one code type to be searched from all<br>
code list 42 and outputs it to code generation section<br>
31 of interference level measuring section 30 (ST202).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST203). To be more specific, code<br>
generation section 31 generates a code based on the input<br>
code type, despreading section 32 despreads the signal<br>
with the code generated and level calculation section<br>
33 calculates the level of the despread signal.<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST204) and<br>
if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the corresponding code type is written to candidate code<br>
list 43 (ST205).<br>
After the operations from ST202 to ST205 are carried<br>
out on all code types stored in all code list 42 (ST206) ,<br>
code determination section 46 determines the code type<br>
of the station from among the code types stored in<br>
candidate code list 43 (ST207)..<br>
Thus, by measuring the interference level for each<br>
code type, storing code types whose interference level<br>
is lower than the threshold in the candidate code list<br>
and determining the code type of the station, it is<br>
possible to eliminate the need for additional code<br>
assignment design when a new base station is added, for<br>
example.<br>
As a method of determining the code type of the<br>
station it is also possible to store not only code types<br>
but also interference levels in the candidate code list<br>
and determine the code type with the lowest interference<br>
level as the code type of the station. This allows<br>
communications with the code type of the best<br>
communication quality.<br>
Moreover, as another method of determining the code<br>
type of the station it is also possible to store not only<br><br>
code types but also interference levels in the candidate<br>
code list and determine the code type with the highest<br><br>
interference level as the code type of the station. This<br>
makes it possible to improve the efficiency of repetitive<br>
use of a same code type and efficiently arrange base<br><br>
stations. <br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Embodiment 2 is an embodiment giving priority to<br>
previously used codes in code assignment operation.<br>
FIG.3 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a<br>
base station in Embodiment 2.<br>
When carrying out code assignment operation, code<br>
reading section 44 in base station 1 in FIG.3 reads a<br>
previously used code type of the station which is held<br>
in code determination section 46. If the interference<br>
level of the previously used code type of the station<br>
is lower than a threshold, threshold determination<br>
section 45 outputs the code type to code determination<br>
section 46. When the code type is input from threshold<br>
determination section 45, code determination section 46<br>
outputs the code type to transmission/reception section<br>
20 as the code type of the station. The other components<br>
in base station 1 in FIG. 3 are the same as those in FIG.l,<br>
and thus they are assigned the same numbers and their<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of the base<br>
station in Embodiment 2 is explained using a flow diagram<br>
in FIG,4.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as candidate<br>
code list 43 are initialized (ST401), and then code<br>
reading section 44 reads the previously used code type<br>
from code determination section 46 and outputs it to code<br>
generation section 31 of interference level measuring<br>
section 30 (ST402). Then, interference level measuring<br>
section 30 measures the level of an interference<br>
component of the received signal (ST403).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 4 5 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST404) and<br>
if the interference level is lower than the threshold.<br>
the previously used code type is output to code<br>
determination section 46 and code determination section<br>
46 determines the code type as the code type of the station<br>
(ST405).<br>
The subsequent operation when the interference<br>
level of the previously used code type is higher than<br>
the threshold is the same as the operations from ST202<br>
to ST207 in the flow diagram in FIG.2. and thus their<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
As seen above, preferentially using the previously<br><br>
used codes eliminates the need for measuring the<br>
interference level of other code types when the <br>
interference level of the previously used code type of<br>
the station is lower than a threshold, making it possible<br>
to shorten the time required for code assignment<br>
operation. <br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
 Embodiment 3 is an embodiment that counts the number<br>
of times the interference level measured during a<br>
communication was lower than a threshold, determines<br>
priority based on the counted value and preferentially<br><br>
uses codes with high priority in code assignment<br>
operation. FIG.5 is a block diagram showing a<br>
configuration of a base station in Embodiment 3.<br>
In the base station in FIG.5 compared to base<br>
station 1 in FIG.l, memory 41 only comprises all code<br>
list 42 and all code list 42 stores not only code types<br>
but also the number of times (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "count value") the interference level measured during<br>
a communication of each code type was lower than the<br>
threshold.<br>
Threshold determination section 45 incorporates a<br>
counter and if the interference level of the code type<br>
measured during a communication was lower than the<br>
threshold, it increments the counter and stores the count<br>
value together with the code type in all code list 42.<br>
Furthermore, threshold determination section 45 treats<br>
a code type with a higher count value as one with higher<br>
priority and sorts all code types in all code list 42<br>
in descending order of priority.<br>
Code reading section 44 measures time with a<br>
built-in timer and reads the assigned code type of the<br>
station stored in code determination section 46 at<br><br><br><br>
regular intervals from the beginning of the<br>
communication. When carrying out code assignment<br>
operation, code reading section 44 reads code types from<br>
all code list 42 in descending order of priority.<br>
Level calculation section 33 subtracts the power<br>
level of the station input from transmission/reception<br>
section 20 from the interference level including the<br>
transmission power of the station calculated from the<br>
despread signal during the communication and calculates<br>
the true interfacence level.<br>
The other components of base station 1 in FIG. 5 are<br>
the same as those in FIG.1, and so they are assigned the<br>
same numbers as those in FIG.l and their explanations<br>
are omitted.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of the base<br>
station in Embodiment 3 is explained using a flow diagram<br>
in FIG.6.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as the timer<br>
of code reading section 44 are initialized (ST601), code<br>
reading section 44 reads the code types whose<br>
interference level has not been measured yet with the<br>
highest priority and outputs it to code generation<br>
section 31 of interference level measuring section 30<br>
(ST602) and interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST603).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST604) and<br>
if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the code type is output to code determination section<br>
46 and code determination section 46 determines the code<br>
type as the code type of the station (ST605). If the<br>
interference level is higher than the threshold in ST604,<br>
the operations from ST602 are repeated once again.<br>
The priority update operation during a<br>
communication of base station 1 in Embodiment 3 is<br>
explained using a flow diagram in FIG.7.<br>
When base station 1 starts a communication, the<br>
timer of code reading section 44 starts (ST701). If a<br>
measurement continues for a certain period of time<br>
(ST703) without power interruption (ST702), the timer<br>
is reset (ST704), and code reading section 44 reads the<br>
assigned code type of the station from code determination<br>
section 46 and outputs it to code generation section 31<br>
of interference level measuring section 30 (ST705).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST706). To be more specific, code<br>
generation section 31 generates a code based on the input<br>
code type, despreading section 32 despreads the signal<br>
with the code generated and level calculation section<br>
33 subtracts the power level of the station input from<br>
transmission/reception section 20 from the interference<br>
level including the transmission power of the station<br>
calculated from the despread signal and calculates the<br>
true interference level.<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST707) and<br>
if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the built-in counter of threshold determination section<br>
45 is incremented (ST708) and the count value in all code<br>
list 42 is corrected (ST709).<br>
A code type with a higher count value is treated<br>
as one with higher priority and all code types in all<br>
code list 42 are sorted in descending order of priority<br>
(ST710) .<br>
As seen above, by counting the number of times the<br>
assigned code type of the station during a communication<br>
was lower than the interference level, treating a code<br>
type with a higher count value as one with higher priority<br>
and measuring the interference level of code types in<br>
descending order of priority, it is possible to<br>
efficiently specify the code types whose interference<br>
level is lower than the threshold and shorten the time<br>
required for code assignment operation. <br>
Embodiment 4)<br>
Embodiment 4 is an embodiment that determines<br>
priority based on the measured interference level and<br>
preferentially uses codes with higher priority in code<br>
assignment operation. FIG.8 is a block diagram showing<br>
a configuration of a base station in Embodiment 4. In<br>
the base station in FIG.8 compared to base station 1 in<br>
FIG.l, memory 41 only comprises all code list 42 and all<br>
code list 42 stores code types as well as the interface<br>
level of each code type.<br>
Threshold determination section 45 treats a code<br>
type with a lower interference level as one with higher<br>
priority and sorts all code types in all code list 42<br>
in descending order of priority. When carrying out code<br>
assignment operation, code reading section 44 reads code<br>
types from all code list 42 in descending order of<br>
priority.<br>
The other components of base station 1 in FIG.8 are<br>
the same as those in FIG.l, and so they are assigned the<br>
same numbers as those in FIG.l and their explanations<br>
are omitted.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of the base<br>
station in Embodiment 4 is explained using a flow diagram<br>
in FIG.9.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus are initialized<br>
(ST901) , code reading section 44 reads the code type with<br>
the highest priority whose interference level has not<br>
been measured yet and outputs it to code generation<br>
section 31 of interference level measuring section 30<br>
(ST902) and interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST903).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 updates<br>
the stored interference level to the interference level<br>
measured by interference measuring section 30 (ST904)<br>
and at the same time compares the interference level<br>
measured by interference level measuring section 30 with<br>
a preset threshold (ST905).<br>
If the interference level is lower than the<br>
threshold, the code type is output to code determination<br>
section 46 and code determination section 46 determines<br>
the code type as the code type of the station (ST906)<br>
and treats a code type with a lower interference level<br>
as one with higher priority and sorts all code types in<br>
all code list 42 in descending order of priority (ST907) .<br>
In ST905, if the interference level is higher than the<br>
threshold, the operations from ST902 are repeated once<br>
again.<br>
Thus, by treating assigned code types with a higher<br>
interference level measured as ones with higher priority<br>
and measuring the interference level of code types in<br>
descending order of priority in code assignment<br>
operation, it is possible to efficiently specify code<br>
types whose interference level is lower than the<br>
threshold and shorten the time required for code<br>
assignment operation.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
Embodiment 5 is an embodiment that measures the<br>
interference level of the assigned code of the station<br>
during a communication, determines priority based on the<br>
interference level measured and preferentially uses<br>
codes with higher priority in code assignment operation.<br>
The configuration of a base station in Embodiment<br>
5 is the same as that in FIG.5 and the code assignment<br>
operation at the base station in Embodiment 5 is the same<br>
as that in Embodiment 4, and so their explanations are<br>
omitted.<br>
The priority update operation during a<br>
communication of the base station in Embodiment 5 is<br>
explained using a flow diagram in FIG.10.<br>
When base station 1 starts a communication, the<br>
timer of code reading section 44 starts (ST1001). If a<br>
measurement continues for a certain period of time<br>
(ST1003) without power interruption (ST1002), the timer<br>
is reset (ST1004), and code reading section 44 reads the<br>
assigned code type of the station from code determination<br>
section 46 and outputs it to code generation section 31<br>
of interference level measuring section 30 (ST1005).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST1006). To be more specific, code<br>
generation section 31 generates a code based on the input<br>
code type, despreading section 32 despreads the signal<br>
with the code generated and level calculation section<br>
33 subtracts the power level of the station input from<br>
transmission/reception section 20 from the interference<br>
level including the transmission power of the station<br>
calculated from the despread level and calculates the<br>
true interference level.<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST1007)<br>
and if the interference level is higher than the<br>
threshold, the interference level is considered to be<br>
the threshold (ST1008) and the interference level in the<br>
corresponding code type in all code list 42 is updated<br>
to the threshold (ST1009) . If the interference level is<br>
lower than the threshold, the interference level in the<br>
corresponding code type in all code list 42 is updated<br>
to the measured interference level (ST1009).<br>
A code type with a higher interference level is<br>
treated as one with higher priority and all code types<br>
in all code list 42 are sorted in order of priority<br>
(ST1010) .<br>
As seen above, by determining priority with<br>
reference to the interference level of the assigned code<br>
type of the station during a communication in addition<br>
to the interference level in code assignment operation<br>
and measuring the interference level of code types in<br>
descending order of priority in code assignment<br>
operation, it is possible to efficiently specify the code<br>
types whose interference level is lower than the<br>
threshold and shorten the time required for code<br>
assignment operation.<br>
Embodiment 6)<br>
Embodiment 6 is an embodiment that determines<br>
priority based on a count value indicating the frequency<br>
of use and preferentially uses codes with higher priority<br>
in code assignment operation. FIG.11 is a block diagram<br>
showing a configuration of a base station in Embodiment<br>
6. In the base station in FIG.11, compared to base<br>
station 1 in FIG.l, memory 41 only comprises all code<br>
list 42 and all code list 42 stores code types as well<br>
as a count value indicating the frequency of use.<br>
Code determination section 46 incorporates a<br>
counter, increments the counter of the code type adopted<br>
as the assigned code type of the station and stores the<br>
count value in all code list 42 . Threshold determination<br>
section 45 treats a code type with a higher count value<br>
as one with higher priority and sorts all code types in<br>
all code list 42 in descending order of priority.<br>
The other components of base station 1 in FIG.11<br>
are the same as those in FIG.l, and so they are assigned<br>
the same numbers as those in FIG.l, and their<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of the base<br>
station in Embodiment 6 is explained using a flow diagram<br>
in FIG.12.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus are initialized<br>
(ST1201), code reading section 44 reads the code type<br>
with the highest priority whose interference level has<br>
not been measured yet and outputs it to code generation<br>
section 31 of interference level measuring section 30<br>
(ST1202) and interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST1203).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST1204)<br>
and if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the code type is output to code determination section<br>
46 and code determination section 46 determines the code<br>
type as the code type of the station (ST1205) and<br>
increments the counter indicating the frequency of use<br>
(ST1206) .<br>
If the count value reaches a preset upper limit,<br>
it subtracts a certain value from the count values of<br>
all code types. However, if the count value after the<br>
subtraction is a negative value, the count value is set<br>
to 0. It is also possible to subtract a certain value<br>
only from the count value of the corresponding code type.<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 treats a<br>
code type with a higher count value as one with higher<br>
priority and sorts code types in all code list 42 in<br>
descending order of priority (ST1207) . In ST1204, if the<br>
interference level is higher than the threshold, the<br>
operations from ST1202 are repeated once again.<br>
Thus, by treating assigned code types with a higher<br>
frequency of use as ones with higher priority and<br>
measuring the interference level of code types in<br>
descending order of priority in code assignment<br>
operation, it is possible to efficiently specify code<br>
types whose interference level is lower than the<br>
threshold and shorten the time required for code<br>
assignment operation.<br>
(Embodiment 7)<br>
Embodiment 7 is an embodiment that fixes priority<br>
for a first code type group and determines priority based<br>
on the interference level measured for a second code type<br>
group and preferentially uses codes with higher priority<br>
in code assignment operation.<br>
Here, the first code type group is a code type group<br>
having the same priority at all base stations and the<br>
second code type group is a code group having priority<br>
specific to each base station.<br>
FIG.13 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of a base station in Embodiment 7. In the base station<br>
in FIG. 13, compared to base station 1 in FIG.8, all code<br>
list 42 stores code types divided into a first code type<br>
group and a second code type group and the second code<br>
type group is stored together with the interference level<br>
of each code type.<br>
Threshold determination section 45 treats code<br>
types in the second code type group with a lower<br>
interference level as ones with higher priority, and<br>
sorts code types in all code list 42 in descending order<br>
of priority.<br>
When carrying out code assignment operation, code<br>
reading section 44 reads code types of the first code<br>
type group in descending order of priority, and then<br>
reads code types of the second code type group in<br>
descending order of priority.<br>
The other components in base station 1 in FIG.13<br>
are the same as those in FIG.8, and so they are assigned<br>
the same numbers as those in FIG.8 and their explanations<br>
are omitted.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of the base<br>
station in Embodiment 7 is explained using flow diagrams<br>
in FIG.14 and FIG.15.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus are initialized<br>
(ST1401), code reading section 44 reads the code type<br>
in the first code type group with the highest priority<br>
whose interference level has not been measured yet and<br>
outputs it to code generation section 31 of interference<br>
level measuring section 30 (ST1402) and interference<br>
level measuring section 30 measures the level of an<br>
interference component of the received signal (ST1403).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST1404)<br>
and if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the code type is output to code determination section<br>
46 and code determination section 46 determines the code<br>
type as the code type of the station (ST1405).<br>
In ST1404, if the interference level is higher than<br>
the threshold, the operations from ST1401 are repeated<br>
once again and when a search is completed for all code<br>
types of the first code type group (ST1406) , code reading<br>
section 44 reads the code type in the second code type<br>
group with the highest priority whose interference level<br>
has not been measured yet and outputs it to code<br>
generation section 31 of interference level measuring<br>
section 30 (ST1407).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST1408) and threshold determination<br>
section 45 updates the stored interference level to the<br>
interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 (ST1409).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 45 compares<br>
the interference level measured by interference level<br>
measuring section 30 with a preset threshold (ST1410)<br>
and if the interference level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the code type is output to code determination section<br>
46 and code determination section 46 determines the code<br>
type as the code type of the station (ST1411).<br>
A code type with a lower interference level is<br>
treated as one with higher priority and all code types<br>
in the second code type group are sorted in descending<br>
order of priority (ST1412). In ST1410, if the<br>
interference level is higher than the threshold, the<br>
operations from ST1407 are repeated once again.<br>
As seen above, by fixing priority in the first code<br>
type group, treating a code type in the second code type<br>
group with a higher interference level measured as one<br>
with higher priority and measuring the interference<br>
level of code types in descending order of priority, it<br>
is possible to efficiently specify the code types whose<br>
interference level is lower than the threshold and<br>
shorten the time required for code assignment operation.<br>
Embodiment 8)<br>
Embodiment 8 is an embodiment that randomly selects<br>
a certain number of code types in code assignment<br>
operation, preferentially measuees the interference<br>
level from the selected codes and uses them as the<br>
assigned codes of the station. A base station in<br>
Embodiment 8 is the same as the base station shown in<br>
When carrying out code assignment operation, code<br>
reading section 44 of base station 1 in Embodiment 8<br>
randomly selects a certain number of code types from all<br>
code list 42, reads the selected code types one by one<br>
and outputs them to interference level measuring section<br>
30.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of base station<br>
1 in Embodiment 8 is explained using a flow diagram in<br>
FIG.16.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as candidate<br>
code list 43 are initialized (ST1601), code reading<br>
section 44 selects a certain number of code types to be<br>
searched from all code list 42 (ST1602), reads one code<br>
type from among the selected code types and outputs it<br>
to code generation section 31 of interference level<br>
measuring section 30 (ST1603).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST1604) and threshold determination<br>
section 45 compares the interference level measured by<br>
interference level measuring section 30 with a preset<br>
threshold (ST1605) and if the interference level is lower<br>
than the threshold, the corresponding code type as well<br>
as the interference level is written to candidate code<br>
list 43 (ST1606) .<br>
Then, the operations from ST1603 to ST1606 are<br>
carried out on all the selected code types (ST1607).<br>
After the operations from ST1603 to ST1606 are<br>
carried out on all the selected code types, if there are<br>
assignment candidate codes (ST1608) , code determination<br>
section 46 determines the code type stored in candidate<br>
code list 43 with the lowest interference level as the<br>
code type of the station (ST1609). In ST1608, if there<br>
is no assignment candidate code, a certain number of code<br>
types to be searched from among the code types that have<br>
not been selected yet and the operations from ST1603 to<br>
ST1607 are repeated (ST1602).<br>
Thus, selecting a certain number of code types and<br>
assigning codes can shorten the time required for code<br>
assignment operation.<br>
By the way, as the method of selecting a certain<br>
number of code types, it is also possible to select a<br>
code type to be searched first and then select a certain<br>
number of code types to be aligned in order starting from<br>
this code type. This makes it possible to simplify the<br>
circuit to select a certain number of code types.<br>
/(Embodiment 9)<br>
Embodiment 9 is a code assignment method by which<br>
a radio communication system classifies code types into<br><br>
several groups and assigns one of them to each base<br><br>
station as a preferred group. A base station in<br>
Embodiment 9 is the same as the base station shown in<br>
FIG.1.<br>
When carrying out code assignment operation, code<br>
reading section 44 of base station 1 in Embodiment 9 sets<br>
a code group to be searched from all code list 42, reads<br>
the set code types one by one and outputs them to<br>
interference level measuring section 30.<br>
If the interference level of the code type is not<br>
lower than a threshold, threshold determination section<br>
45 deletes all code type data included in the code group<br>
to which the code type belongs from candidate code list<br>
43.<br>
Then, the code assignment operation of base station<br>
1 in Embodiment 9 is explained using a flow diagram in<br>
FIG.17.<br>
When base station 1 determines the code type of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as candidate<br>
code list 43 are initialized (ST1701), code reading<br>
section 44 sets a code group to be searched from all code<br>
list 42 (ST1702), reads one code type from the selected<br>
code group and outputs it to code generation section 31<br>
of interference level measuring section 30 (ST1703).<br>
Then, interference level measuring section 30<br>
measures the level of an interference component of the<br>
received signal (ST1704) and threshold determination<br>
section 45 compares the interference level measured by<br>
interference level measuring section 30 with a preset<br>
threshold (ST1705) and if the interference level is lower<br>
than the threshold, the corresponding code type as well<br>
as the interference level is written to candidate code<br>
list 43 (ST1706) .<br>
Then, the operations from ST1703 to ST1706 are<br>
carried out on all the selected code types (ST1707).<br>
In ST1705, if the interference level exceeds the<br>
threshold, all code type data included in the code group<br>
to which the code type belongs are deleted from candidate<br>
code list 43 (ST1708).<br>
After the operations from ST1702 to ST1708 are<br>
repeated until all code groups are set (ST1709), code<br>
determination section 46 determines the code type stored<br>
in candidate code list 43 with the lowest interference<br>
level as the code type of the station(ST1710).<br>
At this time, the code group containing the code<br>
type determined as the code type of the station is<br>
designated as the preferred group of the station.<br>
Thus, even if a radio communication system adopts<br>
a system that classifies code types into several groups<br>
and assigns one of them to each base station as the<br>
preferred group, it is possible to eliminate the need<br>
for additional code assignment design when a new base<br>
station is added, for example.<br>
(Embodiment 10)<br>
 Embodiment 10 is a code assignment method when there<br>
 are a plurality of channels on an assigned frequency axis .<br>
FIG.18 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a<br>
base station in Embodiment 10 of the present invention.<br>
Base station 1 in FIG.18 mainly comprises<br>
transmission/reception section 20 that transmits/<br>
receives signals to/from a mobile station and receives<br>
an interference signal transmitted from another base<br>
station via antenna 10, interference level measuring<br>
section 30 that measures the interference level of a<br>
signal received by transmission/reception section 20,<br>
code assignment control section 40 that carries out code<br>
type assignment control based on the interference level,<br>
reception level measuring section 50 that measures the<br>
reception level of the signal received by<br>
transmission/reception section 20 and channel<br>
assignment control section 60 that carries out channel<br>
assignment control based on the measured reception<br>
level.<br>
Channel assignment control section 60 comprises<br>
memory 61 that stores channels and memory 61 comprises<br>
all channel list 62 that stores all channels in a list<br>
form and candidate channel list 63 that stores assignment<br>
candidate channels in a list form. Channel assignment<br>
control section 60 also comprises channel setting<br>
section 64 that sets channels to be measured from all<br>
channel list 62 and outputs them to reception level<br>
measuring section 50, threshold determination section<br>
65 that determines assignment candidate channels from<br>
the reception level input from reception level measuring<br>
section 50 and a preset threshold and writes the channel<br>
number to be an assignment candidate to candidate channel<br>
list 63 and channel determination section 66 that<br>
determines the channel of the station used from candidate<br>
channel list 63 and outputs it to code assignment control<br>
section 40.<br>
Interference level measuring section 30 and code<br>
assignment control section 40 adopts one of Embodiment<br>
1 to Embodiment 9.<br>
Then, the channel assignment operation of base<br>
station 1 in Embodiment 10 is explained using a flow<br>
diagram in FIG.19.<br>
When base station 1 determines the channel of the<br>
station, the sections of the apparatus such as candidate<br>
channel list 63 are initialized (ST1901), channel<br>
setting section 64 reads one channel to be searched from<br>
all channel list 62 and outputs it to reception level<br>
measuring section 50 (ST1902) and reception level<br>
measuring section 50 measures the reception level of the<br>
received signal (ST1903).<br>
Then, threshold determination section 65 compares<br>
the reception level measured by reception level<br>
measuring section 50 with a preset threshold (ST1904)<br>
and if the reception level is lower than the threshold,<br>
the corresponding channel number is written to candidate<br>
channel list 63 (ST1905).<br>
Then, the operations from ST1902 to ST1905 are<br>
carried out on all channels stored in all channel list<br>
62 (ST1906) and channel determination section 66<br>
determines the channel of the station from among channels<br>
stored in the candidate channel list (ST1907).<br>
After the channel assignment operation is<br>
completed, through the determined channel of the station,<br>
interference level measuring section 30 and code<br>
assignment control section 40 carry out the code<br>
assignment operation explained in one of Embodiment 1<br>
to Embodiment 9 and determine the code type of the<br>
station.<br>
As seen above, measuring the reception level for<br>
each channel, determining the channel of the station and<br>
carrying out code assignment operation through the<br>
determined channel of the station eliminates the need<br>
for theoretical design for assigning codes to all base<br>
stations even if there are a plurality of channels on<br>
the assigned frequency axis.<br>
As the method of determining the channel of the<br>
station, it is also possible to store channels as well<br>
as the reception levels in the candidate channel list<br>
and determine the one with the lowest reception level<br>
as the channel of the station. This allows<br>
communications using the channel with the best<br>
communication quality.<br>
Furthermore, as the method of determining the<br>
channel of the station, it is also possible to store<br>
channels as well the reception levels in the candidate<br>
channel list and determine the one with the highest<br>
reception level as the channel of the station. This<br>
makes it possible to improve the efficiency in repeatedly<br>
using the same channel and efficiently arrange base<br>
stations.<br>
 The embodiments above explained cases where a code<br>
type was used as code specification information, but the<br>
present invention is not limited to this, and can use<br>
other information such as code phase. Furthermore, the<br>
embodiments above can be combined among them as<br>
appropriate. <br>
In the embodiments above, the frequency of<br>
implementing code assignment operation can be set as<br>
appropriate such as implementing code assignment<br>
operation at specific intervals or when power is turned<br>
on.<br>
The base station apparatus in the embodiments above<br>
can switch code types when the communication quality<br>
deteriorates by the mobile station apparatus monitoring<br>
the communication quality and reporting it to the base<br>
station apparatus and the base station apparatus<br>
carrying out code assignment operation based on the<br>
communication quality related information from the<br>
mobile station apparatus.<br>
An explanation for this code type switching method<br>
is given below. FIG.20 is a system diagram showing a<br>
radio communication system including the CDMA base<br>
station apparatus of the present invention. Mobile<br>
station apparatus 2 and mobile station apparatus 3 in<br>
FIG.20 are located in a radio zone which is an area<br>
allowing communications with base station apparatus 1<br>
and have a function to monitor the communication quality<br>
and report it to the base station apparatus.<br>
Now, suppose base station apparatus 1 transmits a<br>
signal to mobile station apparatus 2 and mobile station<br>
apparatus 3 using code type n and the<br>
transmission/reception section determines whether the<br>
communication quality has deteriorated or not based on<br>
the communication quality related information received<br>
from mobile station apparatus 2 and mobile station<br>
apparatus 3.<br>
If base station apparatus 1 determines that the<br>
communication quality has deteriorated, it first<br>
determines code type m to be updated using the code<br>
assignment method explained in one of the embodiments<br>
above.<br>
Then, base station apparatus 1 notifies mobile<br>
station apparatus 2 and mobile station apparatus 3 of<br>
the time required until the code is changed. When the<br>
notified time has elapsed, base station apparatus 1<br>
switches code type n to code type m.<br>
Thus, switching a code type when the communication<br>
quality deteriorates can maintain the communication<br>
quality optimal even if interference from neighboring<br>
cells occurs.<br>
Furthermore, when there are a plurality of code<br>
types to be searched, it is possible to share code types<br>
to be searched between the base station and mobile<br>
station, search respective shared code types, report the<br>
search results from the mobile station to the base<br>
station, organize the search results by the base station<br>
and switch the code types based on these search results.<br>
If the mobile station can perform RAKE reception<br>
with a plurality of code types, it is also possible, when<br>
switching code types, for the base station to transmit<br>
a signal using both code types before and after the update<br>
and for the mobilestation to perform RAKE reception of<br>
both code types before and after the update.<br>
In the case of a radio communication system that<br>
performs transmission from the base station to mobile<br>
station using a plurality of code types, it is normally<br>
possible to determine all code types used using the code<br>
assignment method explained in one of the embodiments<br>
above. When switching the code type whose communication<br>
quality has deteriorated in this radio communication<br>
system, if nothing other than the code to be switched<br>
is changed, it is possible to carry out smooth switching<br>
of code types without deteriorating the overall<br>
communication quality.<br>
As explained above, the CDMA base station apparatus<br>
and code assignment method of the present invention can<br>
eliminate the need for theoretical design for assigning<br>
codes to all base stations even if a new base station<br>
is added.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
described embodiments, and various variations and<br>
modifications may be possible without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>

containing code specification information without a reading order, the reading starts<br>
from the code specification information having great interference levels.<br>
13. The code assignment method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the number of<br>
times each code specification information has been set as the code specification<br>
information for said CDMA base station apparatus is counted; and<br>
wherein, with reference to the respective numbers of times acquired through the<br>
counting, the code specification information is read from those having great numbers.<br>
14. The code assignment method as claimed in claim 9, wherein if one of a<br>
plurality of code specification information groups contains the code specification<br>
information having a smaller interference level than a predetermined threshold, the<br>
code specification information for said CDMA base station apparatus is determined<br>
without measuring the interference level of other code specification information.<br>
15. The code assignment method as claimed in claim 14, wherein a predetermined<br>
number of code specification information are dividing toform a code specification<br>
information group.<br>
16. The code assignment method as claimed in claim 14, wherein a code<br>
specification information group containing the code specification information having a<br>
greater interference level than a predetermined threshold is not subject to the<br>
selection of the code information candidate for said CDMA base station apparatus.<br>
This invention relates to a code reader reads code specification information<br>
stored in a code list. An interference level measurer measures the interference<br>
level of a received signal despread with the code specification information read<br>
by the code reader. A threshold selector selects a code specification information<br>
corresponding to an interference level smaller than a preset threshold and stores<br>
the selected code specification information in a code candidate list. A code<br>
determiner determines the code specification information of a base station from<br>
the selected code specification information. When a new base station is added, a<br>
base station code may be automatically determined without needing a theoretical<br>
design for assigning codes to all base stations.</td>
