				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to enzyme inhibitors, and more particularly, to novel oxobutyric acids compounds or derivatives thereof useful for inhibiting matrix metalloproteases. Description of the Related Art<br>
The matrix metalloproteases (a.k.a. matrix metalloendo-proteinases or MMPs) are a family of zinc endoproteinases which include, but are not limited to, interstitial collagenase (a.k.a.. MMP-1), stromelysin (a.k.a.. proteoglycanase, transin, or MMP-3), gelatinase A (a.k.a.. 72kDa-gelatinase or MMP-2) and gelatinase B (a.k.a.. 95kDa-gelatinase or MMP-9). These MMPs are secreted by a variety of cells including fibroblasts and chondrocytes, along with natural proteinaceous inhibitors known as TIMPs (Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase).<br>
All of these MMPs are capable of destroying a variety of connective tissue components of articular cartilage or basement membranes. Each MMP is secreted as an inactive proenzyme which must be cleaved in a subsequent step before it is able to exert its own proteolytic activity. In addition to the matrix destroying effect, certain of these MMPs such as MMP-3 have been implemented as the in vivo activator for other MMPs such as MMP-1 and MMP-9 (Ito, et al., Arch Biochem Biophys. 267. 211 (1988); Ogata, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267. 3581 (1992)). Thus, a cascade of proteolytic activity can be initiated by an excess of MMP-3. It follows that specific MMP-3 inhibitors should limit the activity of other MMPs that are not directly inhibited by such inhibitors.<br>
It has also been reported that MMP-3 can cleave and thereby inactivate the endogenous inhibitors of other proteinases such as elastase (Winyard. et al., FEBS Letts. 279, 1,91 (1991)). Inhibitors of MMP-3 could thus influence the activity of other destructive proteinases by modifying the level of their endogenous inhibitors.<br>
A number of diseases are thought to be mediated by excess or undesired matrix-destroying metalloprotease activity or by an imbalance in the ratio of the MMPs to the TIMPs. These include: a) osteoarthritis (Woessner, et al., J. Biol.Chem., 259(6). 3633 (1984); Phadke, et al., J. Rheumatol. 1Q, 852 (1983)), b) rheumatoid arthritis (Mullins, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 695. 117 (1983); Woolley, et al., Arthritis Rheum. 20, 1231 (1977); Gravallese, et al., Arthritis Rheum. 34, 1076 (1991)), c) septic arthritis (Williams, et al., Arthritis Rheum. 3_i, 533 (1990)), d) tumor metastasis (Reich, et al., Cancer Res., 48, 3307 (1988); and Matrisian, et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., USA 83., 9413 (1986)), e) periodontal diseases (Overall, et al., J. Periodontal Res. 22, 81 (1987)), f) comeal ulceration (Burns, et al., Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 30, 1569 (1989)), g) proteinuria (Baricos, et al., Biochem. J. 254. 609 (1988)), h) coronary thrombosis from atherosclerotic plaque rupture (Henney, et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., USA 88, 8154 (1991)), i) aneurysmal aortic disease (Vine, et al., Clin. Sci. 81, 233 (1991)), j) birth control (Woessner, et al., Steroids 54, 491 (1989)), k) dystrophobic epidermolysis bullosa (Kronberger, et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 79,208 (1982)), and 1) degenerative cartilage loss following traumatic joint injury, m) conditions leading to inflammatory responses, osteopenias mediated by MMP activity, n) tempero mandibular joint disease, o) demyelating diseases of the nervous system (Chantry, et al., J. Neurochem. 50, 688 (1988)).<br>
The need for new therapies is especially important in the case of arthritic diseases. The primary disabling effect of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and septic arthritis is the progressive loss of articular cartilage and thereby normal joint function. No marketed<br>
pharmaceutical agent is able to prevent or slow this cartilage loss, although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been given to control pain and swelling. The end result of these diseases is total loss of joint function which is only treatable by joint replacement surgery. MMP inhibitors are expected to halt or reverse the progression of cartilage loss and obviate or delay surgical intervention.<br>
Proteases are critical elements at several stages in the progression of metastatic cancer. In this process, the proteolytic degradation of structural protein in the basal membrane allows for expansion of a tumor in the primary site, evasion from this site as well as homing and invasion in distant, secondary sites. Also, rumor induced angiogenesis is required ifor tumor growth and is dependent on proteolytic tissue remodeling. Transfection experiments with various types of proteases have shown that the matrix metalloproteases play a dominant role in these processes in particular gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively). For an overview of this field see Mullins, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 695. 177 (1983); Ray, et al., Eur. Respir. J. 7,2062 (1994); Birkedal-Hansen, et al., Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 4, 197 (1993).<br>
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that inhibition of degradation of extracellular matrix by the native matrix metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP-2 (a protein) arrests cancer growth (DeClerck, et al., Cancer Res. 52, 701 (1992)) and that TIMP-2 inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis in experimental systems (Moses, et al. Science 248. 1408 (1990)). For a review, see DeClerck, et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 732. 222 (1994). It was further demonstrated that the synthetic matrix metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat when given intraperitoneally inhibits human colon tumor growth and spread in an orthotopic model in nude mice (Wang, et al. Cancer Res. 54,4726 (1994)) and prolongs the survival of mice bearing human ovarian carcinoma xenografts (Davies, et. al., Cancer Res. 5J,2087 (1993)). The use of this and related compounds has been described in Brown, et al., WO-9321942 A2 (931111).<br>
There are several patents and patent applications claiming the use of metalloproteinase<br>
inhibitors for the retardation of metastatic cancer, promoting tumor regression, inhibiting cancer cell<br>
proliferation, slowing or preventing cartilage loss associated with osteoarthritis or for treatment of<br>
other diseases as noted above (e.g. Levy, et al., WO-9519965 A1; Beckett, et al., WO-9519956 A1;<br>
Beckett, et al., WO-9519957 Al; Beckett, etal., WO-9519961 Al; Brown, et al., WO-9321942 A2;<br>
Crimmin, et al., WO-9421625 Al; Dickens, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,361; Hughes, et al., U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,190,937; Broadhurst, et al., EP 574758 Al; Broadhurst, et al., EP 276436; and Myers, et al..<br>
EP 520573 Al. The preferred compounds of these patents have peptide backbones with a zinc<br>
complexing group (hydroxamic acid, thiol, carboxylic acid or phosphinic acid) at o	md a<br>
variety of sidechains, both those found in the natural amino acids as well as those with more novel functional groups. Such small pepiides are often poorly absorbed, exhibiting low oral bioavailability. They are also subject to rapid proteoiytic metabolism, thus having short half lives. As an example, batimastat, the compound described in Brown, st al.. WO-9321942 A2, can only be given intraperitoneally.<br>
Others have disclosed a series of Diphenyi-ccntaining carboxylic acids   'ustra1     oy the<br>
compound shown below, which inhibit neural endopeptidase (NEP "	oound zinc<br>
metalloprotease (Stanton. 'T il., Bioorg     -d. Chem "	,, ^ombaert, et al., Bioorg.<br>
Med. Chem. Lett.	± Med. Chem. Lett. 5, 145 (1995);<br>
Lombaert, et al., Bi<br>

It has been reported that N-carboxyalkyl derivatives containing a biphenylethylglycine, illustrated by the compound shown below, are inhibitors of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). 72 kDA gelatinase (MMP-2) and collagenase (Durette, et al., WO-9529689).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
It would be desirable to have effective MMP inhibitors which possess improved bioavailability and biological stability relative to the peptide-based compounds of the prior art, and which can be optimized for use against particular target MMPs. Such compounds are the subject of the present application.<br>
The development of efficacious MMP inhibitors would afford new therapies for diseases mediated by the presence of, or an excess of MMP activity, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, tumor metastasis, periodontal diseases, comeal ulcerations, and proteinuria. Several inhibitors of MMPs have been described in the literature, including thiols (Beszant, et al., J. Med. Chem. 16, 4030 (1993)), hydroxamic acids (Wahl, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 5, 349 (1995); Conway, et al. J. Exp. Med. 182. 449 (1995); Porter, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4, 2741 (1994); Tomczuk, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 5, 343 (1995); Castelhano, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 5_, 1415 (1995)), phosphorous-based acids (Bird, et al. J. Med. Chem. 3J7, 158<br>
(1994); Morphy, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4,2747 (1994); Kortylewicz, et al., J. Med. Chem. 33, 263 (1990)), and carboxylic acids (Chapman, et al. J. Med. Chem. 36, 4293 (1993); Brown, et al. J. Med. Chem. 37, 674 (1994); Morphy, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4,2747 (1994); Stack, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 287. 240 (1991); Ye. et al., J. Med. Chem. 37, 206 (1994); Grobelny, et al., Biochemistry 24, 6145 (1985); Mookhtiar, et al., Biochemistry 27, 4299 (1988)). However, these inhibitors generally contain peptidic backbones, and thus usually exhibit low oral bioactivity due to poor absorption and short half lives due to rapid proteolysis. Therefore, there remains a need for improved MMP inhibitors.<br>

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures. Nevertheless, the following general preparative methods are presented to aide the reader in synthesizing the inhibitors. More detailed procedures for particular examples are presented below in the experimental section.<br>
In the general methods the following generic descriptions apply. The group designated P represents a protecting group. It may be appreciated by one skilled in the act that a variety of different protecting groups may be used to protect a potentially reactive functional group (e.g. carboxylic acid, alcohol) and that the particular choice will depend upon the reaction conditions required to prepare a given target compound. A description of such protecting groups may be found in: Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley and Sons. New York. 1991.<br>
The group designated X represents a leaving group, It is well known to those skilled in the an that several different functional groups such as halides, mesylates, tosylates and triflates may serve as a leaving groups. It is also known that the choice of a particular leaving group typically depends on such factors as the reactivity of the nucleophile, stability of the compound and ease of synthesis.<br>
General Method A - The compounds of the invention where E does not contain a ring are conveniently prepared using an (a-halomethyl ketone and a substituted malonate derivative. The a-halomethyl ketone intermediate Cffl (X = Cl, Br) can be conveniently prepared from a carboxylic acid or a methyl ketone. From carboxylic acid Cl, treatment with oxalyl chloride and a catalytic amount of DMF in a solvent like trimethylsilylchloride provides the corresponding acid chloride. Subsequent treatment with excess diazomethane followed by anhydrous HC1 or HBr provides intermediate Cffl. Alternatively, intermediate Cffl can be prepared from methyl ketone CD via the corresponding silyl enol ether by treatment with jV-bromosuccinimide (NBS). The silylenol ether is conveniently prepared from the methyl ketone by treatment with triniethylsilylchlotide (TMSCI) and a base like lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS). General procedures for the preparation of<br><br>
a-halomethyl ketones are well-known to those skilled in the art.   For additional references see Corey, et al..Tetrahedron Lett. 25,495 (1984) and Reuss, et al., J. Org. Chem. 39,1785 (1974).<br>
Methods for the preparation of substituted malonate derivatives (CV) are also well-established in the literature. Typically, an unsubstituted malonate derivative is treated with a base like NaH or KOt-Bu in a polar aprotic solvent, and then alkylated with a substituted halide. Similarly, alkylation of mono alkylated intermediate CV with a-halomethyl ketone Cffl provides dialkylated intermediate, CVI. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that sidechain Y may be the sidechain desired in the final target or a simple handle to further elaborate that portion of the molecule at a latter stage of the synthesis. If sidechain Y is the desired sidechain, then intermediate CVI can simply be deprotected and decarboxylated using well-known procedures to give target compound CVHI. The conditions used to deprotect intermediate CVI will depend on the type of protecting group used. Some convenient protecting groups used to synthesize the compounds of the invention include methyl, allyl, benzyl and tert-butyl. Methods to incorporate and remove these groups are well-known to those skilled in the art (see above reference). The choice of protecting group used in the synthesis will depend on such factors as functional group compatibility, ease of synthesis and availability of starting materials.<br>
If the target compound CXI contains a moiety Q which is sensitive to the reaction conditions used in the alkylation steps then an intermediate sidechain Y can be used. In this case, a protected ethanol group such as CH2CH2OTBS can be conveniently incorporated as this handle. Intermediate CV with Y = -CH2CH,OTBS can be prepared by using TBSOCH2CH2Br as Y-X in the first alkylation step. TBSOCH2CH2Br can be prepared from HOH2CH2Br by methods well-known to those skilled in the art. The protecting group can be removed to provide the corresponding alcohol which may be converted to phenyl ethers or a variety of heteroatom substituted derivatives used to generate sidechain Q via the Mitsunobu reaction. The Mitsunobu reaction is well known to those<br>
skilled in the art; see Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1 (1981), and Hughes, Organic Reactions 42, 335 (1 992). Alternatively, the alcohol intermdiate is converted to a leaving group such as tosylate or -bromide and displaced by an appropriate nucleophile. Several examples of this type of reaction can be found in Norman, et al., J. Med. Chem 37, 2552 (1994). After the desired sidechain Q is incorporated to form CX, the malonate moiety can be deprotected and decarboxylated to provide the target compound CXI. In some cases the ketone moiety of intermediate Cffl may need to be protected to avoid undesired side reactions. If required, protection as an acetal using the protocols like those described in Hwu. et al.. J. Org, Chem. 50, 3946 (1985), is generally preferred.<br><br>

General Method B - The compounds of this invention in which two R6groups are joined to form a substituted 5-member ring E are most conveniently prepared by method B. In this method acid MI (R=H) is prepared using the protocols described in Beeley, et al.,Tetrahedron 37 Suppl., 411 (1981). The acid is protected as an ester [e.g., R= benzyl (Bn) or 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl (TMSE)] by use of coupling agents such as l-(3-dimnethylaminopropyl-3-ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride and procedures well known to those skilled in the art. The Grignard reagent Mil [prepared from the<br>
corresponding bromide by treatment with magnesium] is reacted with MI (R = Bn, TMSE) to yield alcohol Mffl. Alcohol MTU is eliminated via base treatment of its mesylate using conditions well known to those skilled in the art to yield olefin MTV. Ozonolysis of MTV (workup with methysulfide) yields aldehyde MV. Alternatively, treatment with OsO
Conversion of key intermediate MV to the targeted patent compounds is accomplished in several ways depending on the identity of side chain function J. Reaction of MV with Wittig reagents followed by hydrogenation yields products in which J is alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl. Selective reduction of aldehyde MV with a reducing agent such as lithium tris[(3-ethyl-3-pentyl)oxy]aluminum hydride (LTEPA) yields alcohol MV1. The alcohol may be converted to phenyl ethers or a variety of heteroatom substituted derivatives used to generate sidechain R16 via the Mitsunobu reaction. The Mitsunobu reaction is well known to those skilled in the an: see Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1 (1981), and Hughes, Organic Reactions, 42, 335 (1992). Alternatively alcohol MVI is converted to a leaving group such as tosylate MVII or bromide by conditions well known to those skilled in the art and then the leaving group is displaced by the appropriate nucleophile. Several examples of this type of reaction can be found in Norman, et al., Med. Chem. 37, 2552 (1994). Direct acylation of the alcohol MVI yields compounds in which J = OAcyl and reaction of the alcohol with various alkyl halides in the presence of base yields alkyl ethers. In each case a final step is removal of acid blocking group R to yield acids (R = H) by using conditions which depend on the stability of R and J, but in all cases well known to those skilled in the art. Removal of the benzyl group, for example, may be accomplished by base hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis, whereas deprotection of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl ester is typically carried out by simple treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention include addition salts formed with organic or inorganic bases. The salt forming ion derived from such bases can be metal ions, e.g., aluminum, alkali metal ions, such as sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium or magnesium, or an amine salt ion, of which a number are known for this purpose. Examples include ammonium salts, arylalkylamines such as dibenzylamine and jV.A-dibenzylethylenediamine, lower alkylamines such as methylamine. /-butylamine, procaine. lower alkylpiperidines such as A'-ethylpiperidine, cycloalkylamines such as cyclohexylamine or dicyclohexylamine, 1-adamantylamine. benzathine. or salts derived from amino acids like arginine, lysine or the like. The physiologically acceptable salts such as the sodium or potassium salts and the amino acid salts can be used medicinally as described below and are preferred.<br>
These and other salts which are not necessarily physiologically acceptable are useful in isolating or purifying a product acceptable for the purposes described below. For example, the use of commercially available enantiomerically pure amines such as (+)-cinchonine in suitable solvents can yield salt crystals of a single enatiomer of the invention compounds, leaving the opposite enantiomer in solution in a process often referred to as "classical resolution." As one enantiomer<br>
of a given invention compound is usually substantially greater in physiological effect than its antipode, this active isomer can thus be found purified in either the crystals or the liquid phase. The salts are produced by reacting the acid form of the invention compound with an equivalent of the base supplying the desired basic ion in a medium in which the salt precipitates or in aqueous medium and then lyophilizing. The free acid form can be obtained from the salt by conventional neutralization techniques, e.g.. with potassium bisulfate. hydrochloric acid, etc.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have been found to inhibit the matrix metalloproteases MMP-3. MMP-9 and MMP-2. and to a lesser extent MMP-1, and are therefore useful for treating or preventing the conditions referred to in the background section. As other MMPs not listed above share a high degree of homology with those listed above, especially in the catalytic site, it is deemed that compounds of the invention should also inhibit such other MMPs to varying degrees. Varying the substituents on the biaryl portions of the molecules, as well as those of the propanoic or butanoic acid chains of the claimed compounds, has been demonstrated to affect the relative inhibition of the listed MMPs. Thus compounds of this general class can be "tuned" by selecting specific substituents such that inhibition of specific MMP(s) associated with specific pathological conditions can be enhanced while leaving non-involved MMPs less affected.<br>
The method of treating matrix metalloprotease-mediated conditions may be practiced in mammals, including humans, which exhibit such conditions.<br>
The inhibitors of the present invention are contemplated for use in veterinary and human applications. For such purposes, they will be employed in pharmaceutical compositions containing active ingredient(s) plus one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, fillers, binders, and other excipients, depending on the administration mode and dosage form contemplated.<br>
Administration of the inhibitors may be by any suitable mode known to those skilled in the art. Examples of suitable parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarticular, subcutaneous<br>
and intramuscular routes. Intravenous administration can be used to obtain acute regulation of peak plasma concentrations of the drug. Improved half-life and targeting of the drug to the joint cavities may be aided by entrapment of the drug in liposomes. It may be possible to improve the selectivity of liposomal targeting to the joint cavities by incorporation of ligands into the outside of the liposomes that bind to synovial-specific macromolecules. Alternatively intramuscular, intraarticular or subcutaneous depot injection with or without encapsulation of the drug into degradable microspheres e.g., comprising poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) may be used to obtain prolonged sustained drug release. For improved convenience of the dosage form it may be possible to use an i.p. implanted reservoir and septum such as the Percuseal system available from Pharmacia. Improved convenience and patient compliance may also be achieved by the use of either injector pens (e.g. the Novo Pin or Q-pen) or needle-free jet injectors (e.g. from Bioject, Mediject or Becton Dickinson). Prolonged zero-order or other precisely controlled release such as pulsatile release can also be achieved as needed using implantable pumps with delivery of the drug through a cannula into the synovial spaces. Examples include the subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps available from ALZA. such as the ALZET osmotic pump.<br>
Nasal delivery may be achieved by incorporation of the drug into bioadhesive paniculate carriers (
A noteworthy attribute of the compounds of the present invention in contrast to those of various peptidic compounds referenced in the background section of this application is the demonstrated oral activity of the present compounds. Certain compounds have shown oral bioavailabiliry in various animal models of up to 90 - 98 %. Oral delivery may be achieved by incorporation of the drug into tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules,<br>
solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Oral delivery may also be achieved by incorporation of the drug into enteric coated capsules designed to release the drug into the colon where digestive protease activity is low. Examples include the OROS-CT/Osmet™ and PULSINCAP™ systems from ALZA and Scherer Drug Deliver)' Systems respectively. Other systems use azo-crosslinked polymers that are degraded by colon specific bacterial azoreductases, or pH sensitive polyacrylate polymers that are activated by the rise in pH at the colon. The above systems may be used in conjunction with a wide range of available absorption enhancers.<br>
Rectal delivery may be achieved by incorporation of the drug into suppositories.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be manufactured into the above listed formulations by the addition of various therapeutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, polyols such as polyethylene glycol. water, saccharose, alcohols, glycerin and the like. Various preservatives, emulsifiers, dispersants. flavorants, wetting agents, antioxidants. sweeteners, colorants, stabilizers, salts, buffers and the like are also added, as required to assist in the stabilization of the formulation or to assist in increasing bioavailability of the active ingredient(s) or to yield a formulation of acceptable flavor or odor in the case of oral dosing.<br>
The amount of the pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend on the recipient and the condition being treated. The requisite amount may be determined without undue experimentation by protocols known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the requisite amount may be calculated, based on a determination of the amount of target enzyme which must be inhibited in order to treat the condition.<br>
The matrix metalloprotease inhibitors of the invention are useful not only for treatment of the physiological conditions discussed above, but are also useful in such activities as purification<br>
of metalloproteases and testing for matrix metalloprotease activity. Such activity testing can be both in vitro using natural or synthetic enzyme preparations or in vivo using, for example, animal models in which abnormal destructive enzyme levels are found spontaneously (use of genetically mutated or transgenic animals) or are induced by administration of exogenous agents or by surgery which disrupts joint stability.<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
Biological Assays of Invention Compounds P218 Quenched Fluorescence Assay for MMP Inhibition:<br>
The P218 quenched fluorescence assay (Microfluorometric Profiling Assay) is a modification of that originally described by Knight, et al., FEES Lett. 296. 263, 1992 for a related substance and a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cuvettes. The assay was run with each invention compound and the three MMPs, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-2, analyzed in parallel, adapted as follows for a 96-well microtiter plate and a Hamilton AT* workstation. P218 Fluorogenic Substrate:<br>
P218 is a synthetic substrate containing a 4-acetyl-7-methoxycoumarin ( MCA) group in the N-terminal position and a 3-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl (DPA) group internally. This is a modification of a peptide reported by Knight (1992) that was used as a substrate for matrix<br>
metalloproteinases. Once the P218 peptide is cleaved (putative clip site at the Ala-Leu bond), the fluorescence of the MCA group can be detected on a fluorometer with excitation at 328 nm and emission at 393 nm. P218 is currently being produced BACHEM exclusively for Bayer. P218 has the structure:<br>
H-MCA-Pro-Lys-Pro-Leu-^/a-Iew-DPA-Ala-Arg-NH2  (MW 1332.2) Recombinant Human CHO Stromelvsin (MMP-3)<br>
Recombinant Human CHO Pro-MMP-3: Human CHO pro-stromelysin-257 (pro-MMP-3) was expressed and purified as described by Housley, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268.4481 (1993).<br>
Activation of Pro-MMP-3: Pro-MMP-3 at 1.72 uM (100 Mg/mL) in 5 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCK, 25 mM NaCl, and 0.005% Brij-35 MMP-3) activation buffer) was activated by incubation with TPCK (N-tosyl-(L)-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone) trypsin (1:100 w/w to pro-MMP-3) at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 5:1 w/w to trypsin concentration). This activation protocol results in the formation of 45 kDa active MMP-3, which still contains the C-terminal portion of the enzyme. Preparation of Human Recombinant Pro-Gelatinase A (MMP-2):<br>
Recombinant Human Pro-MMP-2: Human pro-gelatinase A (pro-MMP-2) was prepared using a vaccinia expression system according to the method of Fridman, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267. 15398(1992).<br>
Activation of Pro-MMP-2: Pro-MMP-2 at 252 mg/mL was diluted 1:5 to a final concentration of 50 Mg/mL solution in 25 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl:, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% Brij-35 (MMP-2 activation buffer). /7-Aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) was prepared in 10 mM (3.5 mg/mL) in 0.05 NaOH. The APMA solution was added at 1/20 the reaction volume for a final AMPA concentration of 0.5 mM, and the enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Activated MMP-2 (15 mL) was dialyzed twice vs. 2 L of MMP-2 activation buffer (dialysis<br>
membranes were pre-treated with a solution consisting of 0.1% BSA in MMP-2 activation buffer for 1 min. followed by extensive H:0 washing). The enzyme was concentrated on Centricon concentrators (concentrators were also pre-treated with a solution consisting of 0.1 % BSA in MMP-2 activation buffer for 1 min.. followed by washing with H2O, then MMP-2 activation buffer) with re-dilution followed by re-concentration repeated twice. The enzyme was diluted to 7.5 mL (0.5 times the original volume) with MMP-2 activation buffer. Preparation of Human Recombinant Pro-Gelarinase B (MMP-9):<br>
Recombinant Human Pro-MMP-9: Human pro-gelatinase B (pro-MMP-9) derived from U937 cDNA as described by Wilhelm, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 264. 17213 (1989) was expressed as the full-length form using a baculovirus protein expression system. The pro-enzyme was purified using methods previously described by Hibbs. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 260.2493 (1984).<br>
Activation of Pro-MMP-9: Pro-MMP-2 20 ug/mL in 50 mM Tris at pH 7.4, lOmM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% Brij-35 (MMP-9 activation buffer) was activated by incubation with 0.5 mM p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The enzyme was dialyzed against the same buffer to revmove the APMA. Instrumentation:<br>
Hamiltion Microlab AT Plus: The MMP-Profiling Assay is performed robotically on a Hamilton MicroLab AT Plus*. The Hamilton is programmed to: (1) serially dilute up to 11 potential inhibitors automatically from a 2.5 mM stock in 100% DMSO; (2) distribute substrate followed by inhibitor into a 96 well Cytofluor plate; and (3) add a single enzyme to the plate with mixing to start the reaction. Subsequent plates for each additional enzyme are prepared automatically by beginning the program at the substrate addition point, remixing the diluted inhibitors and beginning the reaction by addition of enzyme. In this way, all MMP assays were done using the same inhibitor dilutions.<br>
Millipore Cytofluor II. Following incubation, the plate was read on a Cytofluor n fluorometiic plate reader with excitation at 340 nM and emission at 395 nM with the gain set at 80. Buffers:<br>
Microfluorometric Reaction Buffer (MRB): Dilution of test compounds, enzymes, and P218 substrate for the microfluorometric assay were made in microfluorometric reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) at pH 6.5 with 10 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Brij-35 and 1% DMSO. Methods;<br>
MMP Microfluorometric Profiling Assay. The assay is done with a final substrate concentration of 6 uM P218 and approximately .5 to .8 nM MMP with variable drug concentrations. The Hamilton is programmed to serially dilute up to 11 compounds from a 2.5 mM stock (100% DMSO) to lOx the final compounds concentrations in the assay. Initially, the instrument delivers various amounts of microfluoromentric reaction buffer (MRB) to a 96 tube rack of 1 ml Marsh dilution tubes. The instrument then picks up 20 ul of inhibitor (2.5 mM) from the sample rack and mixes it with a buffer in row A of the Marsh rack, resulting in a 50 uM drug concentration. The inhibitors are then serially diluted to 10, 5, 1, .2. .05 and .01 uM. Position 1 on the sample rack contains only DMSO for the "enzyme-only" wells in the assay, which results in no inhibitor in column 1, rows A through H. The instrument then distributes 107 ul of P218 substrate (8.2 uM in MRB) to a single 96 well cytofluor microtiter plate. The instrument re-mixes and loads 14.5 ul of diluted compound from rows A to G in the Marsh rack to corresponding rows in the microtiter plate. (Row H represents the "background" row and 39.5 ul of MRB is delivered in placed of drug or enzyme). The reaction is started by adding 25 ul of the appropriate enzyme (at 5.86 times the final enzyme concentration) from a BSA treated reagent reservoir to each well, excluding Row H, the "background" row. (The enzyme reservoir is pretreated with 1% BSA in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5<br>
containing 150 mM NaCl for 1 hour at room temp., followed by extensive H:O washing and drying at room temp.).<br>
After addition and mixing of the enzyme, the plate is covered and incubated for 25 min. at 37 °C. Additional enzymes are tested in the same manner by beginning the Hamilton program with the distribution of P218 substrate to the microtiter plate, followed by re-mixing and distribution of the drug from the same Marsh rack to the microtiter plate. The second (or third, etc.) MMP to be tested is then distributed from a reagent rack to the microtiter plate with mixing, prior to covering and incubation. This is repeated for all additional MMP's to be tested.<br>
1C50 Determination in Microfluorometric Assay: Data generated on the Cytofluor n is copied from an exported ".CSV" file to a master Excel spreadsheet. Data from several different MMPs (one 96 well plate per MMP) were calculated simultaneously. The percent inhibition is determination for each drug concentration by comparing the amount of hydrolysis (fluorescence units generated over 25 minutes of hydrolysis) of wells containing compound with the "enzyme only" wells in column 1. Following subtraction of the background the percent inhibition was calculated as:<br>
((Control values - Treated values)/Control values) x 100<br>
Percent inhibitions were determined for inhibitor concentrations of 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1. 0.02,0 .005 and, 0.001   ^M of drug.    Linear regression analysis of percnet inhibition versus log inhibitor concentration was used to obtain ICJO values. Profiling Assay Data for Invention Compounds.<br>
All IC50 values are expressed as nM. When "I = x %" is shown, x represents the % inhibition at 5 ^M.<br>
