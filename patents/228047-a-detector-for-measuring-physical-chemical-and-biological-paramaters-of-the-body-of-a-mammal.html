FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes support and sensing<br>
structures positioned in a physiologic tunnel for measuring<br>
bodily functions and to manage abnormal conditions<br>
indicated by the measurements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interfering constituents and variables can introduce<br>
significant source of errors that prevent measured biologic<br>
parameters from being of clinical value. In order to bypass<br>
said interfering constituents and achieve undisturbed<br>
signals, invasive and semi-invasive techniques have been<br>
 used. Such techniques have many drawbacks including<br><br>
difficulties in providing continuous monitoring for long<br>
periods of time. Non-invasive techniques also failed to<br>
deliver the clinical usefulness needed. The placement of a<br>
sensor on the skin characterized by the presence of<br>
interfering constituents do not allow obtaining clinically<br>
useful nor accurate signals due to the presence of said<br>
interfering constituents and background noise which greatly<br>
exceeds the signal related to the physiologic parameter<br>
being measured.<br>
The most precise, accurate, and clinically useful way<br>
of evaluating thermal status of the body in humans and<br>
animals is by measuring brain temperature. Brain<br>
temperature measurement is the key and universal indicator<br>
of both disease and health equally, and is the only vital<br>
sign that cannot be artificially changed by emotional<br>
states. The other vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure,<br>
and respiratory rate) all can be influenced and<br>
artificially changed by emotional states or voluntary<br>
effort.<br>
Body temperature is determined by the temperature of<br>
blood, which emits heat as far-infrared radiation. Adipose<br>
tissue (fat tissue) absorbs far-infrared and the body is<br>
virtually completely protected with a layer of adipose<br>
tissue adherent to the skin. Thus measurement of<br><br>
temperature using the skin did not achieve precision nor<br>
accuracy because previous techniques used sensors placed on<br>
skin characterized by the presence of adipose tissue.<br>
Because it appeared to be impossible with current<br>
technology to non-invasively measure brain temperature,<br>
attempts were made to determine internal body temperature,<br>
also referred to as core temperature. An invasive,<br>
artificial, inconvenient, and costly process is currently<br>
used to measure internal (core) temperature consisting of<br>
inserting a catheter with a temperature sensor in the<br>
urinary canal, rectum or esophagus. But such methodology is<br>
not suitable for routine measurement, it is painful, and<br>
has potential fatal complications.<br>
Semi-invasive techniques have also being tried. Abreu<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,120,460 apparatus and<br>
methods for measuring core temperature continuously using a<br>
contact lens in the eyelid pocket, but the contact lens is<br>
a semi-invasive device which requires prescription by a<br>
physician and sometimes it is not easy to place the contact<br>
lens in the eye of an infant or even in adults and many<br>
people are afraid of touching their eyes.<br>
There are several drawbacks and limitations in the<br>
prior art for continuous and/or core measurement of<br>
temperature.<br><br>
Measurement of temperature today is non-continuous,<br>
non-core and nurse dependent. Nurses have to stick a<br>
thermometer in the patient's mouth, rectum or ear. To get<br>
core temperature nurses invasively place a tube inside the<br>
body which can cause infection and costly complications.<br>
Measurement of core temperature on a routine basis in<br>
the hospital and/or continuously is very difficult and<br>
risky because it requires an invasive procedure with<br>
insertion of tubes inside the body or by ingesting a<br>
thermometer pill. The thermometer pill can cause diarrhea,<br>
measure temperature of the fluid/food ingested and not body<br>
temperature, and have fatal complications if the pill<br>
obstructs the pancreas or liver ducts. Placement of sensors<br>
on the skin do not provide clinically useful measurements<br>
because of the presence of many interfering constituents<br>
including fat tissue.<br>
It is not possible to acquire precise and clinically<br>
useful measurements of not only brain temperature, but also<br>
metabolic parameters, physical parameters, chemical<br>
parameters, and the like by simply placing a sensor on the<br>
skin. One key element is the presence of fat tissue. Fat<br>
varies from person to person, fat varies with aging, fat<br>
content varies from time to time in the same person, fat<br>
attenuates a signal coming from a blood vessel, fat absorbs<br><br>
heat, fat prevents delivery of undisturbed far-infrared<br>
radiation, fat increases the distance traveled by the<br>
element being measured inside the body and an external<br>
sensor placed on the surface of the skin.<br>
There is a need to identify a method and apparatus<br>
that can non-invasively, conveniently and continuously<br>
monitor brain temperature in a painless, simple, external<br>
and safe manner with sensors placed on the skin.<br>
There is further a need to identify a method and<br>
apparatus that can conveniently, non-invasively, safely and<br>
precisely monitor biological parameters including metabolic<br>
parameters, physical parameters, chemical parameters, and<br>
the like.<br>
There is a need to identify an apparatus and method<br>
capable of measuring biological parameters by positioning a<br>
sensor on a physiologic tunnel for the acquisition of<br>
undisturbed and continuous biological signals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods, apparatus and<br>
systems that effectively address the needs of the prior<br>
art.<br>
In general, the invention provides a set of sensing<br>
systems and reporting means which may be used individually<br><br>
or in combination, which are designed to access a<br>
physiologic tunnel to measure biological, physical and<br>
chemical parameters. Anatomically and physiologically<br>
speaking, the tunnel discovered by the present invention is<br>
an anatomic path which conveys undisturbed physiologic<br>
signals to the exterior. The tunnel consists of a direct<br>
and undisturbed connection between the source of the<br>
function (signal) within the body and an external point at<br>
the end of the tunnel located on the skin. A physiologic<br>
tunnel conveys continuous and integral data on the<br>
physiology of the body. An undisturbed signal from within<br>
the body is delivered to an external point at the end of<br>
the tunnel. A sensor placed on the skin at the end of the<br>
tunnel allows optimal signal acquisition without<br>
interfering constituents and sources of error.<br>
Included in the present invention are support<br>
structures for positioning a sensor on the skin at the end<br>
of the tunnel. The present invention discloses devices<br>
directed at measuring brain temperature, brain function,<br>
metabolic function, hydrodynamic function, hydration<br>
status, hemodynamic function, body chemistry and the like.<br>
The components include devices and methods for evaluating<br>
biological parameters using patches, clips, eyeglasses,<br>
head mounted gear and the like with sensing systems adapted<br><br>
to access physiologic tunnels to provide precise and<br>
clinically useful information about the physiologic status<br>
of the wearer and for enhancing the safety and performance<br>
of said wearer, and helping to enhance and preserve the<br>
life of said wearer by providing adequate reporting means<br>
and alert means relating to the biological parameter being<br>
monitored. Other components provide for producing direct or<br>
indirect actions, acting on another device, or adjusting<br>
another device or article of manufacture based on the<br>
biological parameter measured.<br>
The search for a better way to measure biological<br>
parameters has resulted in long and careful research, which<br>
included the discovery of a Brain Temperature Tunnel (BTT)<br>
and other physiologic tunnels in humans and animals. The<br>
present invention was the first to recognize the<br>
physiologic tunnel in the body. The present invention was<br>
yet the first to recognize the end of the tunnel on the<br>
skin surface in which an optimal signal is acquired and<br>
measurements can be done without the presence of<br>
interfering constituents and background noise that exceeds<br>
the signal being measured. The present invention was also<br>
the first to recognize and precisely map the special<br>
geometry and location of the tunnel including the main-<br>
entry point. The present invention was yet first to<br><br>
recognize the precise positioning of sensing systems at the<br>
main entry point for optimal signal acquisition. Careful<br>
studies have been undertaken including software development<br>
for characterizing infrared radiation to precisely<br>
determine the different aspects of the tunnel. This<br>
research has determined that the measurement of brain<br>
(core) • temperature and other body parameters can be<br>
accomplished in a non-invasive and continuous manner in<br>
humans and animals with sensors positioned in a confined<br>
area of the skin at the end of a physiologic tunnel.<br>
The key function and critical factor for life<br>
preservation and human performance is brain temperature.<br>
Brain tissue is the tissue in the body most susceptible to<br>
thermal damage, by both high and low temperature. Brain<br>
temperature is the most clinically relevant parameter to<br>
determine the thermal status of the body and the human<br>
brain is responsible for 18 to 20% of the heat produced in<br>
the body, which is an extraordinary fact considering that<br>
the brain represents only 2% of the body weight. The great<br>
amount of thermal energy generated in the brain is kept in<br>
a confined space and the scalp, skull, fat and CSF<br>
(cerebral spinal fluid) form an insulating layer. The<br>
recognition of the BTT by the present invention bypasses<br><br>
the insulating barriers and provides a direct connection to<br>
inside the brain physiology and physics.<br>
Anatomically and physiologically speaking, a Brain<br>
Temperature Tunnel consists of a continuous, direct, and<br>
undisturbed connection between the heat source within the<br>
brain and an external point at the end of the tunnel. The<br>
physical and physiological events at one end of the tunnel<br>
inside the brain are reproduced at the opposite end on the<br>
skin. A BTT enables the integral and direct heat transfer<br>
through the tunnel without interference by heat absorbing<br>
elements, i.e., elements that can absorb far-infrared<br>
radiation transmitted as heat by blood within the brain.<br>
There are six characteristics needed to define a BTT. These<br>
characteristics are:<br>
1)	area without heat absorbing elements, i.e., the area<br>
must not contain adipose tissue (fat tissue) . This is<br>
a key and needed characteristic for defining a<br>
temperature tunnel,<br>
2)	area must have a terminal branch of a vessel in order<br>
to deliver the integral amount of heat,<br>
3)	terminal branch has to be a direct branch of a blood<br>
vessel from the brain,<br><br>
4)	terminal branch has to be superficially located to<br>
avoid heat absorption by deep structures such as<br>
muscles,<br>
5)	area must have a thin and negligible interface between<br>
a sensor and the source of thermal energy to achieve<br>
high heat flow, and<br>
6)	area must not have thermoregulatory arteriovenous<br>
shunts'.<br>
All six characteristics are present on the skin on the<br>
medial canthal area adjacent to the medial corner of the<br>
eye above the medial canthal tendon and in the medial third<br>
of the upper eyelid. In more detail the end of BTT area on<br>
the skin measures about 11 mm in diameter measured from the<br>
medial corner of the eye at the medial canthal tendon and<br>
extends superiorly for about 6 mm and then extends into the<br>
upper eyelid in a horn like projection for another 22 mm.<br>
The BTT area is the only area in the body without<br>
adipose tissue, which is in addition supplied by a terminal<br>
branch, which has a superficial blood vessel coming from<br>
the brain vasculature, and which has a thin interface and<br>
no thermoregulatory shunts. The BTT area is supplied by a<br>
terminal branch of the superior ophthalmic vein which is a<br>
direct connection to the cavernous sinus, said cavernous<br>
sinus being an endothelium-lined system of venous channels<br><br>
inside the brain which collects and stores thermal energy.<br>
The blood vessel supplying the BTT area is void of<br>
thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts and it ends on the<br>
skin adjacent to the medial corner of the eye and in the<br>
superior aspect of the medial canthal area right at the<br>
beginning of the upper eyelid. The blood vessels deliver<br>
undisturbed heat to the skin on the medial canthal area and<br>
upper eyelid as can be seen in the color as well as black<br>
and white photos of infrared images shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
The undisturbed thermal radiation from the brain is<br>
delivered to the surface of the skin at the end of the<br>
tunnel. The heat is delivered to an area of skin without<br>
fat located at the end of the tunnel. The blood vessel<br>
delivering heat is located just below the skin and thus<br>
there is no absorption of . infrared radiation by deep<br>
structures.<br>
If the blood vessel is located deep, other tissues and<br>
chemical substances would absorb the heat, and that can<br>
invalidate the clinical usefulness of the measurement.<br>
There is direct heat transfer and the skin in the BTT area<br>
is the thinnest skin in the body and is void of<br>
thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts. A very important<br>
aspect for optimal measurement of temperature is no<br>
interference by fat tissue and direct heat transfer.<br><br>
The absence of fat tissue in this particular and<br>
unique area in the body at the end of the tunnel allows the<br>
undisturbed acquisition of the signal. The combination of<br>
those six elements allows the undisturbed and integral<br>
emission of infrared radiation from the brain in the form<br>
of direct heat transfer at the BTT area location, which can<br>
be seen in the infrared image photographs (FIGS. 1 to 8) .<br>
The BTT and physiologic tunnels are also referred in this<br>
description as the "Target Area".<br>
From a physical standpoint, the BTT is the equivalent<br>
of a Brain Thermal Energy tunnel with high total radiant<br>
power and high heat flow. The temperature of the brain is<br>
determined by the balance between thermal energy produced<br>
due to metabolic rate plus the thermal energy delivered by<br>
the arterial supply to the brain minus the heat that is<br>
removed by cerebral blood flow. Convection of heat between<br>
tissue' and capillaries is high and the temperature of the<br>
cerebral venous blood is in equilibrium with cerebral<br>
tissue. Accordingly, parenchymal temperature and thermal<br>
energy of the brain can be evaluated by measuring the<br>
temperature and thermal energy of the cerebral venous<br>
blood. The superior ophthalmic vein has a direct and<br>
undisturbed connection to the cavernous sinus and carries<br>
cerebral venous blood with a thermal energy capacity of 3.6<br><br>
J.ml-1. (°C)-1 at hematocrit of 45%. Cerebral thermodynamic<br>
response, thermal energy, and brain temperature can be<br>
evaluated by placing a sensor to capture thermal energy<br>
conveyed by the cerebral venous blood at the end of the<br>
BTT.<br>
The research concerning BTT and physiologic tunnels<br>
involved various activities and studies including: 1) In-<br>
vitro histologic analysis of mucosal and superficial body<br>
areas; 2) In-vivo studies with temperature evaluation of<br>
external areas in humans and animals; 3) In-vivo functional<br>
angiographic evaluation of heat source; 4) Morphologic<br>
studies of the histomorphometric features of the BTT area;<br>
5) In-vivo evaluation of temperature in the BTT area using:<br>
thermocouples, thermistors, and far-infrared; 6) Comparison<br>
of the BTT area measurements with the internal eye anatomy<br>
and current standard most used (oral) for temperature<br>
measurement; 7) Cold and heat challenge to determine<br>
temperature stability of BTT; and 8) Infrared imaging and<br>
isotherm determination. Software for evaluating geometry of<br>
tunnel was also developed and used. Simultaneous<br>
measurement of a reference temperature and temperature in<br>
the BTT area were done using pre-equally calibrated<br>
thermistors. A specific circuit with multiple channels was<br>
designed for the experiments and data collection.<br><br>
The measurement of temperature in the BTT area showed<br>
almost identical temperature signal between the BTT area<br>
and the internal conjunctival anatomy of the eye, which is<br>
a continuation of the central nervous system. Measurement<br>
of the temperature in the internal conjunctival anatomy of<br>
eye as used in the experiment was described by Abreu in<br>
U.S. Patents No. 6,12 0,460 and 6,312,3 93. The averaged<br>
temperature levels for BTT and internal eye were within 0.1<br>
°C (0.18 °F) with an average normothermia value equivalent<br>
of 37.1°C (98.8 °F) for the BTT and 37°C (98.6 °F) for the<br>
internal eye. Comparison with the standard most used, oral<br>
temperature, was also performed. The temperature voltage<br>
signal of the BTT area showed an average higher temperature<br>
level in the BTT area of an equivalent of 0.3 °C (0.5 °F)<br>
when compared to oral.<br>
Subjects underwent cold challenge and heat challenge<br>
through exercising and heat room. The lowering and rising<br>
of temperature in the BTT area was proportional to the<br>
lowering and rising in the oral cavity. However, the rate<br>
of temperature change was faster in the BTT area than for<br>
oral by about 1.2 minutes, and temperature at the BTT site<br>
was 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) higher on few occasions. Subjects of<br>
different race, gender, and age were evaluated to determine<br>
the precise location of the BTT area across a different<br><br>
population and identify any anatomic variation. The<br>
location of the BTT was present at the same location in all<br>
subjects with no significant anatomic variation, which can<br>
be seen in a sample of infrared imaging of different<br>
subjects.<br>
The tunnel is located in a crowded anatomic area and<br>
thus the positioning of the sensor requires special<br>
geometry for optimal alignment with the end of the tunnel.<br>
The clinical usefulness of the tunnel can only be achieved<br>
with the special positioning of the sensor in relation to<br>
anatomic landmarks and the support structure. The tunnel is<br>
located in a unique position with distinctive anatomic<br>
landmarks that help define the external geometry and<br>
location of the end of the tunnel. The main entry point of<br>
the tunnel, which is the preferred location for positioning<br>
the sensor, requires the sensor to be preferably placed in<br>
the outer edge of a support structure. The preferred<br>
embodiment for the measurement of biological parameters by<br>
accessing a physiologic tunnel includes sensors positioned<br>
in a particular geometric position on the support<br>
structure.<br>
The support structure includes patches containing<br>
sensors. For the purpose of the description any structure<br>
containing an adhesive as means to secure said structure to<br><br>
the skin at the end of the tunnel is referred to as a patch<br>
including strips with adhesive surfaces such as a "BAND-<br>
AID" adhesive bandage. It is understood that a variety of<br>
attachment means can be used including adhesives, designs<br>
incorporating spring tension pressure attachment, and<br>
designs based on other attachment methods such as elastic,<br>
rubber, jelly-pads and the like.<br>
The patches are adapted to position sensors at the end<br>
of the tunnel for optimal acquisition of the signal. The<br>
patch is preferably secured to the area by having an<br>
adhesive backing which lays against the skin, although a<br>
combination of adhesive and other means for creating a<br>
stable apposition of the sensor to the tunnel can be used<br>
such as fastening or pressure.<br>
Support structures also include clips or structures<br>
that are positioned at the end of the tunnel with or<br>
without adhesive and which are secured to the area by<br>
pressure means. Any structure that uses pressure means to<br>
secure said structure to the skin at the end of the tunnel<br>
is referred as a clip.<br>
Head-mounted structures are structures mounted on the<br>
head or neck for positioning sensors on the end of the<br>
tunnel and include head bands with accessories that are<br>
adjacent to the tunnel, visors, helmets, headphone,<br><br>
structures wrapping around the ear and the like. For the<br>
purpose of this description TempAlert is referred herein as<br>
a system that measures temperature in the BTT area and has<br>
means to report the measured value and that can incorporate<br>
alarm devices that are activated when certain levels are<br>
reached. Support structures yet include any article that<br>
has sensing devices in which said sensing devices are<br>
positioned at the end of the tunnel.<br>
Support structures further include medial canthal<br>
pieces of eyeglasses. A medial canthal piece is also<br>
referred to herein as a medial canthal pad and includes a<br>
pad or a piece which positions sensing devices on the skin<br>
at the medial canthal area on top of a tunnel, with said<br>
medial canthal piece being permanently attached to or<br>
mounted to an eyeglass. Any sensing devices incorporated in<br>
an eyeglass (fixed or removable) for accessing a tunnel are<br>
referred to herein as EyEXT including devices for sensing<br>
 physical and chemical parameters. Any article of<br>
manufacture that has visual function, or ocular protection,<br>
or face protection with a part in contact with the tunnel<br>
is referred herein as eyeglasses and includes conventional<br>
eyeglasses, prescription eyeglasses, reading glasses,<br>
sunglasses, goggles of any type, masks (including gas<br><br>
masks, surgical masks, cloth masks, diving masks, eyemask<br>
for sleeping and Che like) safety glasses, and the like.<br>
For brain temperature evaluation the tunnel area<br>
consists of the medial canthal area and the superior aspect<br>
of the medial corner of the eye. For brain function<br>
evaluation the tunnel area consists of primarily the upper<br>
eyelid area. For metabolic function evaluation the tunnel<br>
area consists of an area adjacent to the medial corner of<br>
the eye and both the upper and lower eyelids.<br>
The measurement of metabolic function, brain function,<br>
immunogenic function, physical parameters, physico-chemical<br>
parameters and the like includes a variety of support<br>
structures with sensors accessing the physiologic tunnels.<br>
The sensors are placed in apposition to the skin<br>
immediately adjacent to the medial corner of the eye<br>
preferably in the superior aspect of the medial canthal<br>
area. The sensor can also be positioned in the medial third<br>
of the upper eyelid. The sensor is most preferably located<br>
at the main entry point of the tunnel which is located on<br>
the skin 2.5 mm medial to the corner of the eye and about 3<br>
mm above the medial corner of the eye. The diameter of the<br>
main entry point is about 6 to 7 mm. The positioning of the<br>
sensor at the main entry point of the tunnel provides the<br><br>
optimum site for measuring physical and chemical parameters<br>
of the body.<br>
Besides a sensor that makes contact with the skin at<br>
the Target Area, it is understood that sensors which do not<br>
make contact with the skin can be equally used. For<br>
instance an infrared-based temperature measuring system can<br>
be used. The measurement is based on the Stefan-Boltzman<br>
law of physics in which the total radiation is proportional<br>
to the fourth power of the absolute temperature, and the<br>
Wien Displacement law in which the product of the peak<br>
wavelength and the temperature are constant. The field of<br>
view of the non-contact infrared apparatus of the invention<br>
is adapted to match the size and geometry of the BTT area<br>
on the skin.<br>
A variety of lenses known in the art can be used for<br>
achieving the field of view needed for the application. For<br>
example, but not by way of limitation, a thermopile can be<br>
adapted and positioned in a manner to have a field of view<br>
aimed at the main entry point of the BTT area on the skin.<br>
The signal is then amplified, converted into a voltage<br>
output and digitized by a MCU (microcontroller).<br>
This infrared-based system can be integrated into a<br>
support structure that is in contact with the body such as<br>
any of the support structures of the present invention. In<br><br>
addition, it is understood that the infrared-based system<br>
of the present invention can be integrated as a portable or<br>
hand-held unit completely disconnected from the body. The<br>
apparatus of the present invention can be held by an<br>
operator that aims said apparatus at the BTT area to<br>
perform the measurement. The apparatus further includes an<br>
extension shaped to be comfortably positioned at the BTT<br>
site for measuring biological parameters without discomfort<br>
to the subject. The extension in contact with the skin at<br>
the BTT is shaped in accordance with the anatomic landmarks<br>
and the geometry and size of the BTT site. The infrared<br>
radiation sensor is positioned in the extension in contact<br>
with the skin for receiving radiation emitted from the BTT<br>
site.<br>
The present invention provides a method for measuring<br>
biological parameters including the steps of positioning a<br>
sensing device means on the skin area at the end of a<br>
tunnel, producing a signal corresponding to the biological<br>
parameter measured and reporting the value of the parameter<br>
measured.<br>
It is also includes a method to measure biological<br>
parameters by non-contact infrared thermometry comprising<br>
the steps of positioning an infrared detector at the BTT<br>
site with a field of view that encompasses the BTT site and<br><br>
producing a signal corresponding to the measured infrared<br>
radiation. The biological parameters include temperature,<br>
blood chemistry, metabolic function and the like.<br>
Temperature and ability to do chemical analysis of<br>
blood components is proportional to blood perfusion. The<br>
present invention recognizes that the tunnel area, herein<br>
also referred as a Target Area, has the highest superficial<br>
blood perfusion in the head and has a direct communication<br>
with the brain, and that the blood vessels are direct<br>
branches of the cerebral vasculature and void of<br>
thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts. It was also<br>
recognized that the Target Area has the highest temperature<br>
in the surface of the body as can be seen in the<br>
photographs of experiments measuring infrared emission from<br>
the body and the eye.<br>
The Target Area discovered not only has the thinnest<br>
and most homogeneous skin in the whole body but is the only<br>
skin area without a fat layer. Since fat absorbs<br>
significant amounts of radiation, there is a significant<br>
reduction of signal. Furthermore other skin areas only<br>
provide imprecise and inaccurate signals because of the<br>
large variation of adipose tissue from person to person and<br>
also great variability of fat tissue according to age. This<br>
interference by a fat layer does not occur in the Target<br><br>
Area. Furthermore, Che combined characteristics of the<br>
Target Area, contrary to the skin in the rest of the body,<br>
enable the acquisition of accurate signals and a good<br>
signal to noise ratio which far exceeds background noise.<br>
In addition, body temperature such as is found in the<br>
surface of the skin in other parts of the body is variable<br>
according to the environment.<br>
Another important discovery of the present invention<br>
was the demonstration that the Target Area is not affected<br>
by changes in the environment (experiments included cold<br>
and heat challenge). The Target Area provides an optimum<br>
location for temperature measurement which has a stable<br>
temperature and which is resistant to ambient conditions.<br>
The Target Area discovered has a direct connection to the<br>
brain, is not affected by the environment and provides a<br>
natural, complete thermal seal and stable core temperature.<br>
The apparatus and methods of the present invention achieve<br>
precision and clinical usefulness needed with the non-<br>
invasive placement of a temperature sensor on the skin in<br>
direct contact with the heat source from the brain without<br>
the interference of heat absorbing elements.<br>
The Target Area is extremely vascularized and is the<br>
only skin area in which a direct branch of the cerebral<br>
vasculature is superficially located and covered by a thin<br><br>
skin without a fat layer. The main trunk of the terminal<br>
branch of the ophthalmic vein is located right at the BTT<br>
area and just above the medial canthal tendon supplied by<br>
the medial palpebral artery and medial orbital vein. The<br>
BTT area on the skin supplied by a terminal and superficial<br>
blood vessel ending in a particular area without fat and<br>
void of thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts provides a<br>
superficial source of undisturbed biological signals<br>
including brain temperature, metabolic function, physical<br>
signals, and body chemistry such as glucose level, and the<br>
like.<br>
Infrared spectroscopy is a technique based on the<br>
absorption of infrared radiation by substances with the<br>
identification of said substances according to its unique<br>
molecular oscillatory pattern depicted as specific<br>
resonance absorption peaks in the infrared region of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum. Each chemical substance absorbs<br>
infrared radiation in a unique manner and has its own<br>
unique absorption spectra depending on its atomic and<br>
molecular arrangement and vibrational and rotational<br>
oscillatory pattern. This unique absorption spectra allows<br>
each chemical substance to basically have its own infrared<br>
spectrum, also referred to as fingerprint or signature<br>
which can be used to identify each of such substances.<br><br>
Radiation containing various infrared wavelengths is<br>
emitted at the substance to be measured and the amount of<br>
absorption of radiation is dependent upon the concentration<br>
of said chemical substance being measured according to<br>
Beer-Lambert's Law.<br>
Interfering constituents and variables such as fat,<br>
bone, muscle, ligaments and cartilage introduce significant<br>
source of errors which are particularly critical since the<br>
background noise greatly exceeds the signal of the<br>
substance of interest. Since those interfering constituents<br>
are not present on the skin at the BTT area, the sensing<br>
systems positioned at said BTT area can acquire optimal<br>
signal with minimal noise including spectroscopic-based<br>
measurements.<br>
Spectroscopic devices integrated into support<br>
structures disclosed in the present invention can precisely<br>
non-invasively measure blood components since the main<br>
sources of variation and error, such as fat tissue, are not<br>
present in the Target Area. In addition, other key<br>
constituents which interfere with electromagnetic energy<br>
emission such as muscle, cartilage and bones, are not<br>
present in the Target Area either. The blood vessels<br>
delivering the infrared radiation are superficially located<br>
and the infrared radiation is delivered at the end of the<br><br>
tunnel without interacting with other structures. The only<br>
structure to be traversed by the infrared radiation is a<br>
very thin skin, which does not absorb the infrared<br>
wavelength. The present invention includes infrared<br>
spectroscopy means to provide a clinically useful<br>
measurement with the precise and accurate determination of<br>
the concentration of the blood components at the end of the<br>
tunnel.<br>
In addition to spectroscopy in which electromagnetic<br>
energy is delivered to the Target Area, the present<br>
invention also discloses apparatus and methods for<br>
measuring substances of interest through far infrared<br>
thermal emission from the Target Area. Yet, besides near-<br>
infrared spectroscopy and thermal emission, other devices<br>
are disclosed for measurement of substances of interest at<br>
the Target Area including electroosmosis as a flux<br>
enhancement by iontophoresis or reverse iontophoresis with<br>
increased passage of fluid through the skin through<br>
application of electrical energy. Yet, transcutaneous<br>
optical devices can also be integrated into support<br>
structures including medial canthal pieces, modified nose<br>
pads, and the frame of eyeglasses, with said devices<br>
positioned to access the tunnel.<br><br>
It is understood that application of current,<br>
ultrasonic waves as well as chemical enhancers of flow,<br>
electroporation and other devices can be used to increase<br>
permeation at the tunnel site such as for example increased<br>
flow of glucose with the use of alkali salts. In addition<br>
creating micro holes in the target area with a laser, or<br>
other means that penetrate the skin can be done with the<br>
subsequent placement of sensing devices on the BTT site,<br>
with said devices capable of measuring chemical compounds.<br>
Furthermore, reservoirs mounted on or disposed within<br>
support structures, such as the frame and pads of<br>
eyeglasses, can deliver substances transdermally at the BTT<br>
site by various devices including iontophoresis,<br>
sonophoresis, electrocompression, electroporation, chemical<br>
or physical permeation enhancers, hydrostatic pressure and<br>
the like.<br>
In addition to measure the actual amount of oxygen in<br>
blood, the present invention also discloses devices to<br>
measure oxygen saturation and the amount of oxygenated<br>
hemoglobin. In this embodiment the medial canthal piece of<br>
a support structure or the modified nose pads of eyeglasses<br>
contain LEDs emitting at two wave lengths around 940 and<br>
660 nanometers. As the blood oxygenation changes, the ratio<br>
of the light transmitted by the two frequencies changes<br><br>
indicating the oxygen saturation. Since the blood level is<br>
measured at the end of a physiologic brain tunnel, the<br>
amount of oxygenated hemoglobin in the arterial blood of<br>
the brain is measured, which is the most valuable and key<br>
parameter for athletic purposes and health monitoring.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
measuring biological parameters with said method including<br>
the steps of directing electromagnetic radiation at the BTT<br>
area on the skin, producing a signal corresponding to the<br>
resulting radiation and converting the signal into a value<br>
of the biological parameter measured.<br>
Besides using passive radio transmission or<br>
communication by cable; active radio transmission with<br>
active transmitters containing a microminiature battery<br>
mounted in the support structure can also be used. Passive<br>
transmitters act from energy supplied to it from an<br>
external source. The transensor transmits signals to remote<br>
locations using different frequencies indicative of the<br>
levels of biological parameters. Ultrasonic micro-circuits<br>
can also be mounted in the support structure and modulated<br>
by sensors which are capable of detecting chemical and<br>
physical changes at the Target Area. The signal may be<br>
transmitted using modulated sound signals particularly<br><br>
under water because sound is less attenuated by water than<br>
are radio waves.<br>
One preferred embodiment comprises a support structure<br>
including a patch adapted to be worn on or attached with<br>
adhesives to the tunnel and includes structural support, a<br>
sensor for measuring biological parameters, power source,<br>
microcontroller and transmitter. The parts can be<br>
incorporated into one system or work as individual units.<br>
The sensor is located preferably within 7 mm from the outer<br>
edge of the patch. The apparatus of the invention can<br>
include a temperature sensor located in the outer edge of<br>
the patch for sensing temperature. The transmitter, power<br>
source and other components can be of any size and can be<br>
placed in any part of the patch or can be connected to the<br>
patch as long as the sensing part is placed on the edge of<br>
the patch in accordance with the principles of the<br>
invention. The sensor in the patch is positioned on the<br>
skin adjacent to the medial canthal area (medial corner of<br>
the eye) and located about 2 mm from the medial canthal<br>
tendon. The sensor can preferably include electrically-<br>
based sensors, but non-electrical systems can be used such<br>
as chemicals that respond to changes in temperature<br>
including mylar.<br><br>
Besides patches, another preferred embodiment for<br>
measuring biological parameters at the physiologic tunnel<br>
includes a medial canthal pad. The medial canthal piece is<br>
a specialized structure containing sensors for accessing<br>
the tunnel and adapted to be • worn on or attached to<br>
eyeglasses in apposition to the tunnel and includes<br>
structural support, a sensor for measuring biological<br>
parameters, power source, microcontroller and transmitter.<br>
The parts can be incorporated into one system or work as<br>
individual units. The sensors are positioned on the BTT<br>
area. The transmitter, power source, and other components<br>
can be placed in the medial canthal pad or in any part of<br>
the eyeglasses. A medial canthal piece or extension of nose<br>
pads of eyeglasses allow accessing the physiologic tunnel<br>
with sensing devices laying in apposition to the BTT area.<br>
The apparatus of the invention include a temperature<br>
sensor located in the medial canthal pad. For temperature<br>
measurement the sensing system is located on a skin area<br>
that includes the medial- canthal corner of the eye and<br>
upper eyelid. The sensor in the medial canthal pad is<br>
preferably positioned on the skin adjacent to the medial<br>
canthal area (medial corner of the eye) . Although one of<br>
the preferred embodiments for measurement of brain<br>
temperature consists of medial canthal pads, it is<br><br>
understood that also included in the scope of the invention<br>
are nose pads of a geometry and size that reach the tunnel<br>
and that are equipped with temperature sensors preferably<br>
in the outer edge of said nose pads for measuring brain<br>
temperature and other functions. An oversized and modified<br>
nose pad containing sensors using a special geometry for<br>
adequate positioning at the BTT area is also included in<br>
the invention.<br>
With the disclosure of the present invention and by<br>
using anatomic landmarks in accordance with the invention<br>
the sensor can be precisely positioned on the skin at the<br>
end of the tunnel. However, since there is no external<br>
visible indication on the skin relating to the size or<br>
geometry of the tunnel, accessory means can be used to<br>
visualize, map or measure the end of the tunnel on the<br>
skin. These accessory means may be particularly useful for<br>
fitting medial canthal pads or modified nose pads of<br>
eyeglasses.<br>
Accordingly, an infrared detector using thermocouple<br>
or thermopiles can be used as an accessory for identifying<br>
the point of maximum thermal emission and to map the area.<br>
An infrared imaging system or thermography system may be<br>
preferably used. In this instance, an optical store<br>
selling the eyeglasses can have a thermal imaging system.<br><br>
The optician, technician and the like take an infrared<br>
image picture or film the area, and in real time localize<br>
the tunnel of the particular user. The medial canthal pads<br>
or modified nose pads can then be adjusted to fit the<br>
particular user based on the thermal infrared imaging. The<br>
eyeglasses are fitted based on the thermal image created.<br>
This will allow customized fitting according to the<br>
individual needs of the user. Any thermography-based system<br>
can be used including some with great visual impact and<br>
resolution as a tri-dimensional color thermal wave imaging.<br>
It is also a feature of the invention to provide a<br>
method to be used for example in optical stores for<br>
locating the tunnel including the steps of measuring<br>
thermal infrared emission, producing an image based on the<br>
infrared emission, and detecting the area with the highest<br>
amount of infrared emission. Another step that can be<br>
included is adjusting sensors in support structures to<br>
match the area of highest infrared emission.<br>
One of said support structures includes the medial<br>
canthal pieces or nose pads of eyeglasses. The thermal<br>
imaging method can be used for fitting a patch, but said<br>
patch can be positioned at the tunnel by having an external<br>
indicator for lining up said indicator with a permanent ,<br>
anatomic landmark such as the medial corner of the eye.<br><br>
Although medial canthal pieces of eyeglasses can have an<br>
external indicator for precise positioning, since opticians<br>
are used to fit eyeglasses according to the anatomy of the<br>
user, the thermal imaging method can be a better fit for<br>
eyeglasses than an external indicator on the medial canthal<br>
pieces or modified nose pads of eyeglasses.<br>
The source of the signal is key for the clinical<br>
usefulness of the measurement. The brain is the key and<br>
universal indicator of the health status of. the body. The<br>
signal coming from the brain or brain area provides the<br>
most clinically useful data. In accordance with another<br>
embodiment, the measurement of biological parameters will<br>
be described. The amount of sodium and other elements in<br>
sweat is a key factor for safety and performance of<br>
athletes and military, as well as health monitoring.<br>
For instance hyponatremia (decreased amount of sodium)<br>
can lead to reduced performance and even death.<br>
Hyponatremia can occur due to excess water intake, commonly<br>
occurring with intense physical activity and military<br>
training. Sweat can be considered as an ultrafiltrate of<br>
blood. The blood vessels supplying the skin on the head are<br>
branches of the central nervous system vasculature. The<br>
amount of chemical substances present in the sweat coming<br>
from those blood vessels is indicative of the amount of<br><br>
chemical substances present in the cerebral vasculature.<br>
For instance, sodium concentration of sweat from blood<br>
vessels in the head changes in relation to the rates of<br>
sweating. The apparatus and methods of the present<br>
invention can prevent death • or harm due to water<br>
intoxication, by providing alert signals when the levels of<br>
sodium in sweat reach a certain threshold for that<br>
particular wearer. The presence of various chemical<br>
elements, gases, electrolytes and pH of sweat and the<br>
surface of the skin can be determined by the use of<br>
suitable electrodes and suitable sensors integrated in the<br>
eyeglasses and other support structures mounted on the head<br>
or fitted on the head or face. These electrodes, preferably<br>
microelectrodes, can be sensitized by several reacting<br>
chemicals which are in the sweat or the surface of the<br>
skin. The different chemicals and substances can diffuse<br>
through suitable permeable membranes sensitizing suitable<br>
sensors.<br>
For example but not by way of limitation,<br>
electrochemical sensors can be used to measure various<br>
analytes such as glucose using a glucose oxidase sensor and<br>
the pilocarpine iontophoresis method can be used to measure<br>
electrolytes in sweat alone or in conjunction with<br>
microfluidics system. Besides the support structures of the<br><br>
present invention, it is also understood that other<br>
articles such as watches, clothing, footwear and the like<br>
can be adapted to measure concentration of substances such<br>
as electrolytes present in sweat, however there is reduced<br>
clinical relevance for evaluating metabolic state of an<br>
individual outside the central nervous system.<br>
Body abnormalities may cause a change in the pH,<br>
osmolarity, and temperature of the sweat derived from brain<br>
and neck blood vessels as well as change in the<br>
 concentration of substances such as acid-lactic, glucose,<br>
lipids, hormones, gases, markers, infectious agents,<br>
antigens, antibody, enzymes, electrolytes such as sodium,<br>
potassium and chloride, and the like. Eyeglasses and any<br>
head gear can be adapted to measure the concentration of<br>
substances in sweat. Microminiature glass electrodes<br>
mounted in the end portion of the temple of eyeglasses<br>
sitting behind the ear or alternatively mounted on the lens<br>
rim against the forehead can be used to detect divalent<br>
cations such as calcium, as well as sodium and potassium<br>
ion and pH. Chloride-ion detectors can be used to detect<br>
the salt concentration in the sweat and the surface of the<br>
skin.<br>
Many agents including biological warfare agents and<br>
HIV virus are present in sweat and could be detected with<br><br>
the eyeglasses or support structure on the head or face<br>
using sensors coated with antibodies against the agent<br>
which can create a photochemical reaction with appearance<br>
of colorimetric reaction and/or potential shift with<br>
subsequent change in voltage or temperature that can be<br>
detected and transmitted to a monitoring station or<br>
reported locally by audio or visual means. Electrocatalytic<br>
antibodies also can generate an electrical signal when<br>
there is an antigen-antibody interaction. It is also<br>
understood that other articles such as watches, clothing,<br>
footwear, and the like or any article capturing sweat can<br>
be adapted to identify antigens, antibody, infectious<br>
agents, markers (cancer, heart, genetic, metabolic, drugs,<br>
and the like) in accordance with the present invention.<br>
However, identification of those elements away from the<br>
central nervous system is of reduced clinical relevance.<br>
The different amounts of fluid encountered in sweat<br>
can be easily quantified and the concentration of<br>
substances calibrated according to the amount of fluid in<br>
sweat. The relationship between the concentration of<br>
chemical substances and molecules in the blood and the<br>
amount of said chemical substances in the sweat can be<br>
described mathematically and programmed in a computer.<br><br>
The present invention also includes eyeglasses or<br>
support structures in which a radio frequency transensor<br>
capable of measuring the negative resistance of nerve<br>
fibers is mounted in the eyeglasses or support structure.<br>
By measuring the electrical resistance, the effects of<br>
microorganisms, drugs, and poisons can be detected. The<br>
system also comprises eyeglasses in which a microminiature<br>
radiation-sensitive transensor is mounted in said<br>
eyeglasses or support structure.<br>
The brain has a rich vasculature and receives about<br>
15% of the resting cardiac output and due to the absence of<br>
fat the tunnel offers an area for optimal signal<br>
acquisition for evaluating hemodynamics. Accordingly,<br>
change in the viscosity of blood can be evaluated from a<br>
change in damping on a vibrating quartz micro-crystal<br>
mounted in the eyeglasses or support structure and the<br>
invention can be adapted to measure blood pressure and to<br>
provide instantaneous and continuous monitoring of blood<br>
pressure through an intact wall of a blood vessel from the<br>
brain and to evaluate hemodynamics and hydrodynamics. Also,<br>
by providing a contact microphone, arterial pressure can be<br>
measured using sonic devices.<br>
Pressure can be applied to a blood vessel through a<br>
micro cuff mounted in the medial canthal pads, or<br><br>
alternatively by the temples of eyeglasses. Pressure can<br>
also be applied by a rigid structure, and the preferred end<br>
point is reached when sound related to blood turbulence is<br>
generated. The characteristic sound of systole (contraction<br>
of the heart) and diastole (relaxation of the heart) can be<br>
captured by the microphone. A microphone integrated into<br>
the medial canthal pad can be adapted to identify the heart<br>
sounds. Pressure transducers such as a capacitive pressure<br>
transducer with integral electronics for signal processing<br>
and a microphone can be incorporated in the same silicon<br>
structure and can be mounted in the medial canthal pad.<br>
Motion sensors and/or pressure sensors can be mounted in<br>
the medial canthal pad to measure pulse.<br>
Reversible mechanical expansion methods, photometric,<br>
or electrochemical methods and electrodes can be mounted in<br>
the eyeglasses or support structures of the present<br>
invention and used to detect acidity, gases, analyte<br>
concentration, and the like. Oxygen gas can also be<br>
evaluated according to its magnetic properties or be<br>
analyzed by micro-polarographic sensors mounted in the<br>
eyeglasses or other support structure. A microminiature<br>
microphone mounted in the eyeglasses or other support<br>
structure can also be adapted to detect sounds from the<br>
heart, respiration, flow, vocal and the environment, which<br><br>
can be sensed and transmitted to a remote receiver or<br>
reported by local audio and visual means. The sensors are<br>
adapted and positioned to monitor the biological parameters<br>
at the end of the tunnel.<br>
The eyeglasses or other support structures can also<br>
have elements which produce and radiate recognizable<br>
signals and this procedure could be used to locate and<br>
track individuals, particularly in military operations. A<br>
permanent magnet can also be mounted in the eyeglasses and<br>
used for tracking as described above. A fixed frequency<br>
transmitter can be mounted in the eyeglasses and used as a<br>
tracking device which utilizes a satellite tracking system<br>
by noting the frequency received from the fixed frequency<br>
transmitter to a passing satellite, or via Global<br>
Positioning Systems. Motion and deceleration can be<br>
detected by mounting an accelerometer in the eyeglasses.<br>
The use of eyeglasses as tracking devices can be useful for<br>
locating a kidnapped individual or for rescue operations in<br>
the military, since eyeglasses are normally unsuspecting<br>
articles.<br>
The use of integrated circuits and advances occurring<br>
in transducer, power source, and signal processing<br>
technology allow for extreme miniaturization of the<br><br>
components which permits several sensors to be mounted in<br>
one unit.<br>
The present invention provides continuous automated<br>
brain temperature monitoring without the need for a nurse.<br>
The present invention can identify a spike in temperature.<br>
Thus, proper diagnosis is made and therapy started in a<br>
timely fashion. Time is critical for identifying the<br>
temperature spike and organism causing the infection. Delay<br>
in identifying spike and starting therapy for the infection<br>
can lead to demise of the patient. The invention timely and<br>
automatically identifies the temperature spike and prevents<br>
the occurrence of complications.<br>
The present invention also alerts the user about<br>
overheating or hypothermia to allow:<br>
1.	Proper hydration;<br>
2.	Increased performance;<br>
3 . Increased safety; and<br>
4. Feed back control in treadmills and other exercise<br>
machines for keeping proper hydration and performance.<br>
Annually many athletes, construction workers, college<br>
students and the general public unnecessarily die due to<br>
heatstrokes. Once the brain reaches a certain temperature<br>
level such as 40° C, an almost irreversible process ensues.<br>
Because there are no specific symptoms and after a certain<br><br>
point there is rapid increase in brain temperature,<br>
heatstroke has one of the highest fatality rates. The more<br>
severe and more prolonged the episode, the worse the<br>
predicted outcome, especially when cooling is delayed.<br>
Without measuring core temperature and having an alert<br>
system when the temperature falls outside safe levels it is<br>
impossible to prevent hyperthermia and heatstroke. The<br>
present invention provides a device for continuous<br>
monitoring of temperature with alert systems that can<br>
prevent dangerous levels to be reached and cooling measures<br>
applied if needed. The apparatus can be adapted to be used<br>
in an unobtrusive manner by athletes, military, workers and<br>
the general population.<br>
All chemical reactions in the body are dependent on<br>
temperature. High temperature can lead to enzymatic changes<br>
and protein denaturation and low temperature can slow down<br>
vital chemical reactions. Hydration is dependent on brain<br>
temperature and loss of fluid leads to a rise in brain<br>
temperature. Minimal fluctuations in the body's temperature<br>
can adversely affect performance and increase risk of<br>
illness and of life threatening events. Therefore, it is<br>
essential that athletes, sports participants, military<br>
personnel, police officers, firefighters, forest rangers,<br>
factory workers, farmers, construction workers and other<br><br>
professionals have precise mechanisms to know exactly what<br>
is their brain temperature.<br>
When the core temperature rises, the blood that would<br>
otherwise be available for the muscles is used for cooling<br>
via respiration and perspiration. The body will do this<br>
automatically as temperature moves out of the preferred<br>
narrow range. It is this blood shifting that ultimately<br>
impairs physical performance and thermal induced damage to<br>
brain tissue interferes with normal cognitive function.<br>
 Intense exercise can increase heat production in muscles 20<br>
fold. In order to prevent hyperthermia and death by heat<br>
stroke athletes drink water. Because the ingestion of water<br>
is done in a random fashion, many times there is water<br>
intoxication which can lead to death as occurs to many<br>
healthy people including marathon runners and military<br>
personnel. Both, excess of water (overhydration) or lack of<br>
water (dehydration) can lead to fatal events besides<br>
reducing performance. Therefore, it is essential that<br>
individuals have precise means to know exactly when and how<br>
much to drink. By monitoring brain temperature with the<br>
present invention proper hydration can be achieved and<br>
athletes and military will know precisely when and how much<br>
water to ingest.<br><br>
Timely ingestion of fluids according to the core<br>
temperature allows optimization of cardiovascular function<br>
and avoidance of heat strain. Because there is a delay from<br>
the time of ingestion of fluid to absorption of said fluid<br>
by the body, the method of invention includes signaling the<br>
need for ingestion at a lower core temperature such as 38.5°<br>
C to account for that delay, and thus avoid the onset of<br>
exhaustion. The temperature threshold can be adjusted<br>
according to each individual, the physical activity, and<br>
the ambient temperature.<br>
In addition, software can be produced based on data<br>
acquired at the BTT site for optimizing fitness, athletic<br>
performance, and safety. The upper temperature limit of a<br>
particular athlete for maintaining optimal performance can<br>
be identified, and the data used to create software to<br>
guide said athlete during a competition. For instance,• the<br>
athlete can be informed on the need to drink cold fluid to<br>
prevent reaching a certain temperature level which was<br>
identified as reduced performance for said athlete. Brain<br>
temperature level for optimal performance identified can be<br>
used to guide the effort of an athlete during competition<br>
and training. Hyperthermia also affects mental performance<br>
and software based on data from the BTT can be produced to<br>
optimize mental and physical performance of firefighters in<br><br>
an individual manner. People can have different thresholds<br>
for deleterious effects of hyperthermia and thus setting<br>
one level for all users may lead to underutilization of<br>
one's capabilities and putting others at risk of reduced<br>
performance. Likewise, exercise endurance and mental<br>
performance is markedly reduced by hypothermia and the same<br>
settings can be applied for low temperature situations.<br>
Determinations of brain temperature, oxygen and lactic acid<br>
levels can also be used for endurance training of athletes,<br>
fitness training, and to monitor the effects of training.<br>
The system, method, and apparatus of the invention provides<br>
a mechanism for enhancing safety and optimizing fitness for<br>
athletes and recreational sports participants.<br>
It is a feature of the invention to provide a method<br>
for the precise and timely intake of fluids including the<br>
steps of measuring brain temperature, reporting the signal<br>
measured, and ingesting an amount of fluid based on the<br>
signal measured. Other steps can be included such as<br>
reporting devices using voice reproduction or visual<br>
devices to instruct on what beverage to drink and how much<br>
to drink to reduce core temperature. It is understood that<br>
the method of the present invention can combine measurement<br>
of temperature associated with measurement of sodium in<br><br>
sweat or blood, in accordance with the principles of the<br>
invention.<br>
Children do not tolerate heat as well as adults<br>
because their bodies generate more heat relative to their<br>
size than adults do. Children are also not as quick to<br>
adjust to changes in temperatures. In addition, children<br>
have more skin surface relative to their body size which<br>
means they lose more water through evaporation from the<br>
skin. It is understood that different sizes, shapes, and<br>
designs of medial canthal pads including children size can<br>
be used in the present invention. Children eyeglasses<br>
equipped with sensors can have a booster radio transmitter<br>
that will transmit the signal to a remote receiver and<br>
alert parents about dangerous temperature levels. The<br>
eyeglasses can be incorporated with a detecting system to<br>
send a signal if the eyeglasses were removed or if the<br>
temperature sensor is not capturing signals in a proper<br>
manner. By way of illustration, but not of limitation,<br>
pressuse sensing devices can be incorporated in the end of<br>
the temples to detect if the sunglasses are being worn, and<br>
an abrupt drop in the pressure signal indicates glasses<br>
were removed or misplacement of the sensor can also<br>
generate an identifiable signal. An adhesive, a double-<br>
sided adhesive tape, or other devices for increasing grip<br><br>
can be used in Che medial canthal pads to ensure more<br>
stable position. It is understood that the eyeglasses can<br>
come equipped with sensors to detect ambient temperature<br>
and humidty, which allows for precisely alerting the wearer<br>
about any aspect affecting heat conditions.<br>
In the current industrial, nuclear and military<br>
settings, personnel may be required to wear protective<br>
clothing. Although the protective clothing prevent harm by<br>
hazardous agents, the garments increase the rate of heat<br>
storage. It is understood that the present invention can<br>
be coupled with garments with adjustable permeability to<br>
automatically keep the core temperature within safe limits.<br>
In addition, the present invention alerts an<br>
individual about risk of thermal damage (risk of wrinkles<br>
and cancer) at the beach or during outdoor activities. When<br>
one is at the beach, watching a game in a stadium, camping<br>
or being exposed to the sun, the radiant energy of the sun<br>
is absorbed and transformed into thermal energy. The<br>
combination of the different ways of heat transfer to the<br>
body lead to an increase in body temperature, which is<br>
reflected by the brain temperature. Convection and<br>
conduction can also lead to an increase in body temperature<br>
through heat transfer in the absence of sun light. The<br>
absorption of heat from the environment leads to a rise in<br><br>
the average kinetic energy of the molecules with subsequent<br>
increase in core temperature.<br>
The levels of core temperature is related to the risk<br>
of thermal damage to the skin. After certain levels of heat<br>
there is an increased risk of denaturing protein and<br>
breaking of collagen in the skin. This can be compared with<br>
changes that occur when frying an egg. After a certain<br>
amount of thermal radiation is delivered the egg white<br>
changes from fluidic and transparent to a hard and white<br>
structure. After the egg white reaches a certain level of<br>
temperature the structural change becomes permanent. After<br>
a certain level of increase in core temperature during sun<br>
exposure, such as a level of 37.7° Celsius to 37.9° Celsius<br>
at rest (e.g.; sun bathing), thermal damage may ensue and<br>
due to the disruption of proteins and collagen there is an<br>
increased risk for wrinkle formation. The increased brain<br>
temperature correlates to the amount of thermal radiation<br>
absorbed by the body, and the duration of exposure of the<br>
temperature level times the level of temperature is an<br>
indicator of the risk of thermal damage, wrinkle formation,<br>
and skin cancer.<br>
The present invention provides an alarm system that<br>
can be set up to alert in real time when it is time to ,<br>
avoid sun exposure in order to prevent further absorption<br><br>
of thermal radiation and reduce the risk of dermatologic<br>
changes, as can occur during outdoor activities or at the<br>
beach. In addition, thermal damage to the skin prevents the<br>
skin from adequately cooling itself and can result in<br>
increasing the risk of dehydration which further increases<br>
the temperature. The present invention helps preserve the<br>
beauty and health of people exposed to sun light and during<br>
outdoor activities while allowing full enjoyment of the sun<br>
and the benefits of sun light.<br>
By the present invention, a method for timing sun<br>
exposure includes the steps of measuring body temperature,<br>
reporting the value measured and avoiding sun exposure for<br>
a certain period of time based on the level measured.<br>
Hypothermia is the number one killer in outdoor<br>
activities in the U.S. and Europe. Hypothermia also<br>
decreases athletic performance and leads to injuries. It is<br>
very difficult to detect hypothermia because the symptoms<br>
are completely vague such as loss of orientation and<br>
clumsiness which are indistinguishable from general<br>
behavior. Without measuring core temperature and having an<br>
alert system when the temperature falls outside safe levels<br>
it is impossible to prevent hypothermia due to the vague<br>
symptoms. The present invention can alert an individual<br>
about hypothermia during skiing, scuba diving, mountain<br><br>
climbing and hiking. The present invention provides means<br>
to precisely inform when certain temperature thresholds are<br>
met, either too high or too low temperature.<br>
The present invention continuously monitors the brain<br>
temperature and as soon as a temperature spike or fever<br>
occurs it activates diagnostics systems to detect the<br>
presence of infectious agents, which can be done locally in<br>
the BTT site, or the infectious agents can be identified in<br>
other parts of the body such as the blood stream or the<br>
eyelid pocket. The present invention can be also coupled to<br>
drug dispensing devices for the automated delivery of<br>
medications in accordance with the signal produced at the<br>
BTT site including transcutaneous devices, iontophoresis or<br>
by injection using a pump.<br>
The invention also includes a tool for family<br>
planning. The system can detect spike and changes in basal<br>
temperature and identify moment of ovulation and phases of<br>
the menstrual cycle. This allows a woman to plan pregnancy<br>
or avoid pregnancy. This eliminates the need for invasive<br>
devices used for monitoring time for artificial<br>
insemination not only for humans but also animals. The<br>
invention can yet detect the start of uterine contractions<br>
(parturition) and allow a safer birth for animals. Support<br>
structures can be equally used in the BTT of animals.<br><br>
The present invention also includes Automated Climate<br>
control according to the value measured at the BTT. The<br>
temperature of the user controls the temperature in a car.<br>
When the body starts to warm up, the signal from the<br>
apparatus of the invention automatically activates the air<br>
conditioner according to the user settings, alternatively<br>
it activates heat when the body is cold. This automation<br>
allows drivers to concentrate on the road and thus can<br>
reduce the risk for car crashes. It is understood that<br>
other articles that can affect body temperature can be<br>
controlled by the present invention including vehicle<br>
seats.<br>
Current vehicle climate control systems are<br>
dramatically overpowered because they are designed to<br>
heat/cool the vehicle cabin air mass from an extreme<br>
initial temperature to a standard temperature within a<br>
certain period of time. Because people have different<br>
thermal needs for comfort, there is a consistent manual<br>
change of the temperature settings and said manual further<br>
increase consumption of energy. For instance, car<br>
temperature is set to remain at 73 F. Some people after 15<br>
minutes may feel that it is too cold and some people may<br>
feel it is too hot. Subsequently the passenger changes the<br>
setting to 77 and then feels hot after another 10 minutes,<br><br>
and needs to manually change the set points again, and the<br>
process goes on. In addition the needs differ for people of<br>
different age, people with diabetes and other diseases, and<br>
male and female.<br>
Manual frequent adjusting of a vehicle's climate<br>
control may increase fuel consumption 20% and increase<br>
emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide and<br>
nitrogen oxides.<br>
The present invention provides an automated climate control<br>
in which the brain temperature controls the air conditioner<br>
and vehicle seats which maximizes comfort and minimizes<br>
fuel consumption. The improved fuel economy provided by the<br>
present invention protects the environment due to less<br>
pollutants affecting the ozone layer; improves public<br>
health by decreasing emission of toxic fumes, and increases<br>
driver's comfort and safety by less distractions with<br>
manually controlling a car's climate control.<br>
Thermal environment inside transportation vehicles can<br>
be adjusted according to the temperature at the BTT site<br>
including contact sensor measurement and non-contact sensor<br>
measurement such as an infrared sensor or thermal image.<br>
The temperature at the BTT adjusts any article or device in<br>
the car that changes the temperature inside the cabin<br>
including air conditioner and heater, vehicle seats, doors,<br><br>
windows, steering wheels, carpets on the floor of the<br>
vehicle, and the like. Exemplarily, the temperature at the<br>
BTT site adjusts the amount of thermal radiation going<br>
through a window of a vehicle, if the BTT sends a signal<br>
indicating hot sensation then the windows for instance will<br>
darken to prevent further heat from entering the car, and<br>
vice versa if cold is perceived the window changing its<br>
light transmissibility to allow more heat waves to<br>
penetrate the vehicle's cabin. Any article touching the<br>
body or in the vicinity of the body can be adapted to<br>
change its temperature to achieve thermal comfort for the<br>
occupants of the vehicle.<br>
Besides the support structures and thermal imaging<br>
systems described in the present invention to monitor and<br>
adjust temperature of a cabin of a transportation vehicle,<br>
it is understood that a contact lens inside the eyelid<br>
pocket with a temperature sensor can also be adapted to<br>
adjust the temperature inside the cabin of the vehicle.<br>
Exemplary transportation vehicles include cars, trucks,<br>
trains, airplanes, ships, boats, and the like.<br>
It is also understood that the sensing system can<br>
include sensors in other parts of the body working in<br>
conjunction with the temperature sensor measuring<br>
temperature and/or thermal radiation at the BTT site.<br><br>
Thermal energy transfer from an article to an occupant of a<br>
vehicle can occur by any of radiation, convection, and the<br>
like, and any mechanism to transfer deliver, or remove<br>
thermal energy can be adjusted based on a temperature<br>
signal measured at the BTT.<br>
The present invention provides a more energy-efficient<br>
system to achieve thermal comfort of the passengers in any<br>
type of transportation vehicle in existence or being<br>
developed with any type of sensor alone at the BTT site or<br>
 in conjunction with sensors in other parts of the body.<br>
Likewise, automated climate control at home, work, or<br>
any confined area can be achieved by activating the<br>
thermostat directly or via BlueTooth technology based on<br>
the temperature measured at the BTT in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Besides convenience and comfort, this<br>
automation allows saving energy since gross changes<br>
manually done in the thermostat leads to great energy<br>
expenditure.<br>
It is understood that any body temperature measuring<br>
system can provide automated climate control or adjust<br>
temperature of articles in accordance with the principles<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The present invention yet includes methods for<br>
reducing weight. It includes monitoring of temperature<br><br>
during programs for weight reduction based on increasing<br>
body heat to reduce said weight. The system alerts athletes<br>
on a weight losing program to prevent injury or death by<br>
overheating. The system can monitor temperature of people<br>
in sauna, steam rooms, spas and the like as part of weight<br>
reduction programs in order to prevent injuries and enhance<br>
results.<br>
Yet, methods to enhance memory and performance besides<br>
preserving health is achieved by providing an automated<br>
mechanism to control ambient temperature and surrounding<br>
body temperature based on the brain temperature measured by<br>
the present invention. Human beings spend about one third<br>
of their lives sleeping. Many changes in body temperature<br>
occur during sleep. All of the metabolism and enzymatic<br>
reactions in the body are dependent on adequate level of<br>
temperature. The adequate control of ambient temperature<br>
which matches the needs of body temperature such as during<br>
sleeping have a key effect on metabolism. Adequate ambient<br>
temperature and surrounding temperature of objects which<br>
matches body temperature allow not only for people to sleep<br>
better, but also to achieve improved efficiency of<br>
enzymatic reactions which leads to improved mental ability<br>
and improved immune response. A variety of devices such as<br>
blankets, clothing, hats, mattress, pillows, or any article<br><br>
touching the body or in the vicinity of the body can be<br>
adapted to automatically increase or decrease temperature<br>
of said articles according to the temperature signal from<br>
the present invention.<br>
The body naturally becomes cooler during the night and<br>
many people have restless sleep and turn continuously in<br>
bed because of that temperature effect. Since the tossing<br>
and turning occurs as involuntary movements and the person<br>
is not awake, said person cannot change the stimuli such as<br>
for instance increasing room temperature or increasing<br>
temperature of an electric blanket. The present invention<br>
automatically changes the ambient temperature or<br>
temperature of articles to match the temperature needs of<br>
the person. This is particularly useful for infants,<br>
elderly, diabetics, neuro-disorders, heart disease, and a<br>
variety of other conditions, since this population has<br>
reduced neurogenic response to changes in body temperature,<br>
and said population could suffer more during the night,<br>
have increased risk of complications besides decreased<br>
productivity due to sleep deprivation. Accordingly, the<br>
temperature of an electrical blanket or the ambient<br>
temperature is adjusted automatically in accordance with<br>
the temperature at the BTT. When low temperature at the BTT<br>
is detected by the apparatus of the invention a wireless or<br><br>
wired signal is transmitted to the article to increase its<br>
temperature, and in the case of an electrical blanket or<br>
heating system, the thermostat is automatically adjusted to<br>
deliver more heat.<br>
The invention also provides-devices and methods to be<br>
used with bio feedback activities. A brain temperature<br>
signal from the sensor at the BTT site produces a feedback<br>
signal as an audio tone or visual display indicating<br>
temperature and a series of tones or colors identify if the<br>
 brain temperature is increasing (faster frequency and red)<br>
or decreasing (lower frequency and blue). The display<br>
devices can be connected by wires to the support structure<br>
holding the sensor at the BTT site.<br>
Head cooling does not change brain temperature.<br>
Athletes, military, firefighters, construction workers and<br>
others are at risk of heatstroke despite pouring cold water<br>
on their head or using a fan. Medically speaking that is a<br>
dangerous situation because the cool feeling sensed in the<br>
head is interpreted as internal cooling and the physical<br>
activity is maintained, when in reality the brain remains<br>
at risk of thermal induced damage and heatstroke. Other<br>
medical challenges related to temperature disturbances<br>
concern response time. The brain has a slower recovery<br>
response to temperature changes than core temperature<br><br>
(internal temperature measured in rectum, bladder,<br>
esophagus, and other internal mechanisms). Thus, internal<br>
measurement may indicate stable temperature while the brain<br>
temperature remains outside safe levels, with risk of<br>
induced damage to cerebral tissue, either due to<br>
hypothermia or hyperthermia. The only medically acceptable<br>
way to prevent cerebral tissue damage due to temperature<br>
disturbances is by continuous monitoring brain temperature<br>
as provided by the present invention.<br>
The present invention utilizes a plurality of active<br>
or passive sensors incorporated in support structures for<br>
accessing a physiologic tunnel for measuring biological<br>
parameters. The present invention preferably includes all<br>
functions in a miniature semiconductor chip, which as an<br>
integrated circuit, incorporates sensor, processing and<br>
transmitting units and control circuits.<br>
Additional embodiments include temperature measurement<br>
and mass screening for fever and temperature disturbances<br>
(hyperthermia and hypothermia) comprising a body radiation<br>
detector, herein referred as a BTT ThermoScan, which<br>
comprises a thermal imaging system acquiring a thermal<br>
image of the end of the BTT. The BTT ThermoScan of the<br>
present invention has sufficient temperature and isotherm<br>
discrimination for monitoring temperature at all times and<br><br>
without the possibility of the measurement to be<br>
manipulated by artificial influences.<br>
The BTT ThermoScan detects the brain temperature and<br>
provides an image corresponding to the BTT area or an image<br>
that includes the BTT area.<br>
The BTT ThermoScan comprises a camera that converts<br>
thermal radiation into a video image that can be displayed<br>
on a screen, such as the images seen in FIGS. 1A, IB, 3A,<br>
4A, 5A, 5C, 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B, 9A and 9B (for animals), and<br>
most preferably the image seen in FIG. 1B. The radiant<br>
energy emitted from the body and the BTT area is detected<br>
and imaged within the visible range.<br>
Human skin at the BTT site has a high emissivity (e in<br>
the Stefan-Boltzman formula) in the infrared range, nearly<br>
equal to a black body. A video image of people walking by<br>
and looking at the BTT ThermoScan lens is captured and a<br>
customized software is adapted to display a colored plot of<br>
isotherm lines, as the software used to acquire the image<br>
of FIG. 1B in which any point at 99 degrees Fahrenheit is<br>
seen as yellow. For detection of SARS the software is<br>
adapted to display in yellow any point in the BTT area<br>
above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. When the yellow color appears<br>
on the screen, the software is adapted to provide an<br>
automatic alarm system. Therefore when the Brain<br><br>
Temperature Tunnel area appears as yellow on the screen the<br>
alarm is activated. It is understood that any color scheme<br>
can be used. For instance, the threshold temperature can be<br>
displayed as red color.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 7A and 7B, cold challenge<br>
experiments were performed and demonstrated the stability<br>
of thermal emission in the BTT area. The cold challenge<br>
consisted of continuous capturing thermal infrared images<br>
while a subject is exposed to cold including facing a cold<br>
air generator (eg., air conditioner and fans), drinking<br>
cold liquids, body immersion in cold water, and spraying<br>
alcohol on the skin. Despite artificial means used to<br>
artificially change the body temperature the radiation from<br>
the BTT area remained intact, and can be seen as the bright<br>
white spots in the BTT area. Contrary to that, the face<br>
gradually became darker indicating cooling of the face<br>
during the exposure to cold. FIG. 7B shows a darker face<br>
compared to the face in FIG. 7A, but without any change in<br>
the thermal radiation from the BTT area.<br>
In addition to cold challenges, hot challenges was<br>
performed in order to artificially increase body<br>
temperature and included exercise, people with sunburn,<br>
facing a heater, alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking and<br>
body immersion in hot water. In all of those experiments<br><br>
the BTT area remained stable, but the remaining of the face<br>
had a change of temperature reflecting skin temperature,<br>
not internal brain temperature. As seen in FIGs. 2A to 2C<br>
the brain is completely insulated from the environment,<br>
with the exception of the end • of the BTT. The current<br>
technology will have too many false positives and someone<br>
could be stopped at an airport or at customs just for<br>
drinking some alcohol or smoking a cigarette, making the<br>
devices in the prior art ineffective. Therefore, the<br>
present invention provides a system and method that<br>
eliminates or reduces both false negatives and false<br>
positives when using thermal imaging detection systems.<br>
Many useful applications can be achieved including<br>
mass screening for fever, screening for hyperthermia in<br>
athletes at the end of a sports event (e.g., marathon),<br>
screening for hypothermia or hyperthermia for military<br>
personnel so as to select the one best fit physiologically<br>
for battle, and any other temperature disturbance in any<br>
condition in which a BTT ThermoScan can be installed.<br>
One particular application consists of prevention of a<br>
terrorist attack by a terrorist getting infected with a<br>
disease (e.g., SARS - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)<br>
and deceiving thermometers to avert detection of fever when<br>
entering the country target for the terrorist attack.<br><br>
SARS could potentially become a high terrorist threat<br>
because it cannot be destroyed. By being naturally created,<br>
SARS could become a weapon of mass destruction that cannot<br>
be eliminated despite use of military force or diplomatic<br>
means. A terrorist can get the infection with the purpose<br>
of spreading the infection in the target country. With<br>
current technology any device can be deceived and current<br>
devices would measure normal temperature when indeed fever<br>
is present. Simple means can be used by a terrorist, such<br>
as washing their face with cold water or ice or by<br>
immersion in cold water, to manipulate any device in the<br>
prior art used for measuring fever including current<br>
infrared imaging systems and thermometers. The thermal<br>
physiology of the body, as it is measured and evaluated by<br>
the prior art, can be manipulated and the measurement<br>
performed can give a false negative for fever.<br>
A terrorist with SARS could easily spread the disease<br>
by many ways including individually by shaking hands with<br>
clerks on a daily basis on a mass scale by spending time in<br>
confined environments such as movie theater, a concert,<br>
grocery store, a government building, and others, or by<br>
contaminating water or drinking fountains. All of those<br>
people infected do not know they caught the disease and<br>
start to spread SARS to family members, co-workers, friends<br><br>
and others, who subsequently will infect others, leading to<br>
an epidemic situation.<br>
From a medical standpoint, intentional spread of SARS<br>
can have immeasurable devastating effects. People not<br>
knowing they have the disease may go to a hospital for<br>
routine checks or people not feeling good may go to a<br>
hospital for routine checks. Patients and others coming to<br>
the hospital can then acquire the disease. Admitted<br>
patients, who are debilitated, can easily acquire SARS.<br>
 Spread of SARS in a hospital environment can be devastating<br>
and the hospital may need to shut down. Therefore, one<br>
person with SARS can lead to the shut down of a whole<br>
hospital. Considering that people infected with the disease<br>
may go to different hospitals, several hospitals could get<br>
contaminated and would have to be partially or completely<br>
shut down. This could choke the health care system of a<br>
whole area, and patients would have to be transported to<br>
other hospitals. Those patients may have acquired SARS as<br>
well as perpetuating the transmission cycle. If this is<br>
done in several areas by a concerted terrorist effort, much<br>
of the health care system of a country could be choked,<br>
besides countless doctors and nurses could become infected<br>
with SARS which would further cripple the health care<br>
system by shortage of personnel.<br><br>
The key to prevent the catastrophic effects of. a<br>
terrorist attack is preparedness. The apparatus and methods<br>
of the present invention can detect SARS and cannot be<br>
manipulated by artificial means. Placement of the BTT<br>
ThermoScan of the present invention at the borders, ports<br>
and airports of a country can prevent the artificial<br><br>
manipulation of the temperature measurement and a possible<br>
terrorist attack. The system of the present invention can<br>
identify at all times and under any circumstances the<br>
presence of SARS and other diseases associated with fever.<br>
In addition, mass screening of athletes could be<br>
performed with a BTT ThermoScan installed at the finish<br>
line. An alert is activated for any athlete who crosses the<br>
finish line with a high level of hyperthermia. Therefore<br>
immediate care can be delivered allowing for the best<br>
clinical outcome since any delay in identifying<br>
hyperthermia could lead to heatstroke and even death. The<br>
BTT ThermoScan is adapted to view at least a portion of the<br>
BTT area. BTT ThermoScan detects the brain temperature and<br>
provides an image corresponding to or that includes the BTT<br>
area. Despite athletes pouring water on their head, the BTT<br>
ThermoScan precisely detects the thermal status of the body<br>
by detecting the temperature at the BTT.<br><br>
Temperature disturbances such as hyperthermia and<br>
hypothermia can impair mental and physical function of any<br>
worker. Drivers and pilots in particular can have reduced<br>
performance and risk of accidents when affected by<br>
temperature disturbances. The BTT ThermoScan can be mounted<br>
in the visor of a vehicle or plane to monitor body<br>
temperature with the camera of the BTT ThermoScan capturing<br>
a thermal image of the BTT of the driver or pilot and<br>
providing an alert whenever a disturbance is noticed. It is<br>
understood that any thermal imaging system can be mounted<br>
in a vehicle or airplane to monitor body temperature and<br>
 alert drivers and pilots.<br>
The BTT ThermoScan also includes monitoring mass<br>
screening of children and people at risk during flu season.<br>
With the shortage of nurses an automated screening can<br>
greatly enhance the delivery of health care to the ones in<br>
need. When a student walking by the infrared camera is<br>
identified as having a temperature disturbance (e.g.,<br>
fever) a conventional digital camera is activated and takes<br>
a picture of the student. The picture can be emailed to the<br>
school nurse that can identify the student in need of care<br>
or automatically by using stored digital pictures.<br>
Hospitals, factories, homes, or any location that can<br>
benefit from automated mass or individual screening of<br><br>
temperature disturbances can use the thermal imaging<br>
apparatus in accordance with the present invention.<br>
It is understood that an apparatus comprised of a<br>
radiation source emitting a wavelength around 556 nm at the<br>
BTT site can be used for determining the concentration of<br>
hemoglobin. The hemoglobin present in the red blood cells<br>
 at the terminal end of the BTT strongly absorbs the 556 nm<br>
wavelength and the reflected radiation acquired by a<br>
photodetector determines the amount of hemoglobin. Blood<br>
 flow can be evaluated by knowing the amount with thermal<br>
radiation, the higher amount of the thermal radiation<br>
indicating higher blood flow in accordance to a<br>
mathematical model.<br>
Positioning of contact sensors, non-contact sensors,<br>
and thermal imaging camera are facilitated by external<br>
visible anatomic aspects that may be present. The cerebral<br>
venous blood can be seen under the skin in the medial<br>
canthal area next to the corner of the eye. Therefore a<br>
method for measuring temperature includes the step of<br>
visually detecting the blue or bluish color of the skin at<br>
the BTT area and positioning the sensor on or adjacent to<br>
the blue or bluish area. For subjects of darker skin, a<br>
distinctive feature of difference skin texture in the BTT<br><br>
area next to the medial corner of the eye can be used as<br>
the reference for measurement.<br>
The present invention includes devices for collecting<br>
thermal radiation from a BTT site, devices for positioning<br>
temperature sensitive devices to receive thermal radiation<br>
from the BTT site and devices for converting said thermal<br>
radiation into the brain temperature. The present invention<br>
also provides methods for determining brain temperature<br>
with said methods including the steps of collecting the<br>
thermal emission from the BTT site, producing a signal<br>
corresponding to the thermal emission collected, processing<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 In describing a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be<br><br>
resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, the<br>
invention is not intended to be limited to the specific<br>
terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each<br>
specific term includes all technical equivalents which<br>
operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar<br>
purpose.<br>
FIG. 1A shows a thermal infrared image of the human<br>
face showing a physiologic tunnel. The figure shows an<br>
image of the end of the brain temperature tunnel (BTT)<br>
depicted as white bright spots in the medial canthal area<br>
and the medial half of the upper eyelid. The end of the BTT<br>
on the skin has special geometry, borders, and internal<br>
areas and the main entry point is located on the supero-<br>
medial aspect of the medial canthal area diametrically in<br>
position with the inferior portion of the upper eyelid and<br>
4 mm medial to the medial corner of the eye. From there<br>
the boundary goes down in the medial canthal area<br>
diametrically in position with the medial corner of the eye<br>
and within 5 mm down from the medial corner of the eye, and<br>
proceeding up to the upper eyelid with the lateral boundary<br>
beginning at the mid-part of the upper eyelid as a narrow<br>
area and extending laterally in a fan-like shape with the<br>
superior boundary beginning in the mid-half of the upper<br>
eyelid.<br><br>
The scale indicates the range of temperature found in<br>
the human face. The hottest spots are indicated by the<br>
brightest white spots and the coldest areas are black.<br>
Temperature between the hottest and coldest areas are seen<br>
in different hues in a gray scale. The nose is cold (seen<br>
as black) since it is primarily composed of cartilage and<br>
bones, and consequently has a lower blood volume. That is<br>
the reason why frostbite is most common in the nose.<br>
The surrounding periocular area of the upper and lower<br>
eyelids (seen as gray) is hotter because of high<br>
vascularization and the reduced amount of adipose tissue.<br>
The skin underneath the eyelids is very thin and does not<br>
have adipose tissue either. However, the other conditions<br>
necessary to define a brain temperature tunnel are not<br>
present in this area.<br>
The BTT requirements also include the presence of a<br>
terminal branch to deliver the total amount of heat, a<br>
terminal branch that is a direct branch from a vessel from<br>
the brain, a terminal branch that is superficially located<br>
to avoid far-infrared radiation absorption by other<br>
structures, and no thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts.<br>
Thus, the BTT, i.e., the skin area in the medial corner of<br>
the eye and upper eyelid, is the unique location that can<br>
access a brain temperature tunnel. The skin around the<br><br>
eyelids delivers undisturbed signals for chemical<br>
measurements using spectroscopy and is defined as a<br>
metabolic tunnel with optimal acquisition of signals for<br>
chemical evaluation, but not for evaluation of the total<br>
radiant power of the brain.<br>
FIG. 1B is a computer generated thermal infrared color<br>
plot image of the human face showing in detail the geometry<br>
and different areas of the brain temperature tunnel and<br>
surrounding areas. Only few creatures such as some beetles<br>
and rattle snakes can see this type of radiation, but not<br>
humans. The infrared images make the invisible into<br>
visible. Thus the geometry and size of the tunnel can be<br>
better quantified. The color plot of the isothermal lines<br>
show the peripheral area of the tunnel in red and the<br>
central area in yellow-white with the main entry point at<br>
the end of the BTT located in the supero-medial aspect of<br>
the medial canthal area above the medial canthal tendon.<br>
The main entry point is the area of most optimal<br>
signal acquisition. The image also shows the symmetry of<br>
thermal energy between the two BTT sites. Since other areas<br>
including the forehead do not have the aforementioned six<br>
characteristics needed to define a BTT, said areas have<br>
lower total radiant power seen as light and dark green.<br>
Thus the forehead is not suitable to measure total radiant<br><br>
power. The whole nose has very little radiant power seen as<br>
blue and purple areas/ and the tip of the nose seen as<br>
brown has the lowest temperature of the face. Thus, the<br>
nose area is not suitable for measuring biological<br>
parameters.<br>
FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram of a physiologic<br>
tunnel, more particularly a Brain Temperature Tunnel. From<br>
a physical standpoint, the BTT is a brain thermal energy<br>
tunnel characterized by a high total radiant power and high<br>
heat flow and can be characterized as a Brain Thermal<br>
Energy tunnel. The tunnel stores thermal energy and<br>
provides an undisturbed path for conveying thermal energy<br>
from one end of the tunnel in the cavernous sinus inside of<br>
the brain to the opposite end on the skin with the thermal<br>
energy transferred to the surface of the skin at the end of<br>
the tunnel in the form of far-infrared radiation. High heat<br>
flow occurs at the end of tunnel which is characterized by<br>
a thin interface, and the heat flow is inversely<br>
proportional to the thickness of the interface.<br>
The total radiated power (P) at the end of the tunnel<br>
is defined by P = ơ*e*A*T4, where ơ is the Stefan-Boltzman<br>
constant with a value ơ - 5.67 x 10-8 w.m-2.K-4 and e is the<br>
emissivity of the area. Since the end of the tunnel<br>
provides an optimal area for radiation, the total power<br><br>
radiated grows rapidly as the temperature of the brain<br>
increases because of the T4 term in the equation. As<br>
demonstrated in the experiments in the present invention<br>
mentioned, the radiated power in the BTT occurred at a<br>
faster rate than the radiated power in the tongue and oral<br>
cavity.<br>
The BTT site on the skin is a very small area<br>
measuring only less than 0.5% of the body surface area.<br>
However, this very small skin region of the body provides<br>
the area for the optimal signal acquisition for measuring<br>
both physical and chemical parameters.<br>
FIG. 2A shows the brain 10 with the thermal energy 12<br>
stored in its body. The BTT 20 includes the brain. 10, the<br>
thermal energy 12 stored in the brain 10, the thermal<br>
energy stored in the tunnel 14 and the thermal energy 16<br>
transferred, to the exterior at the end of . the tunnel. The<br>
thermal energy 12, 14, 16 is represented by dark arrows of<br>
same size and shape. The arrows have the same size<br>
indicating undisturbed thermal energy from one end of the<br>
tunnel to the other and characterized by equivalent<br>
temperature within the tunnel.<br>
Thermal energy from the sinus cavernous in the brain<br>
10 is transferred to the end of the tunnel 16 and a rapid<br>
rate of heat transfer occurs through the unimpeded cerebral<br><br>
venous blood path. The tunnel also has a wall 18<br>
representing the wall of the vasculature storing the<br>
thermal energy with equivalent temperature and serving as a<br>
conduit from the inside of the body 10 to the exterior<br>
(skin surface) 19 which ends "as a terminal vessel 17<br>
transferring the total amount of thermal energy to said<br>
skin 19.<br>
The skin 19 is very thin and allows high heat flow.<br>
The thickness of skin 19 is negligible compared to the skin<br>
 39, 4 9 in non-tunnel areas 3 0 and 4 0 respectively. Due to<br>
the characteristics of skin 19, high heat flow occurs and<br>
thermal equilibrium is achieved rapidly when a sensor is<br>
placed on the skin 19 at the end of the BTT 20.<br>
In other areas of skin in the face and in the body in<br>
general, and in the exemplary non-tunnel areas 30 and 40 of<br>
FIG. 2 several interfering phenomena occur besides the lack<br>
of direct vasculature connection to the brain, and includes<br>
self-absorption and thermal gradient. 1. Self-absorption:<br>
This relates to the phenomena that deep layers of tissue<br>
selectively absorb wavelengths of infrared energy prior to<br>
emission at the surface. The amount and type of infrared<br>
energy self-absorbed is unknown. At the surface those<br>
preferred emissions are weak due to self-absorption by the<br>
other layers deriving disordered thermal emission and<br><br>
insignificant spectral characteristic of the substance<br>
being analyzed being illustratively represented by the<br>
various size, shapes and orientations of arrows 34a to 3 6g<br>
and 44a to 46g of FIG.2. Self-absorption in non-tunnel<br>
areas thus naturally prevents useful thermal emission for<br>
measurement to be delivered at the surface. 2. Thermal<br>
gradient: there is a thermal gradient with the deeper<br>
layers being warmer than the ' superficial layers,<br>
illustratively represented by thicker arrows 36d and 46d in<br>
the deeper layers compared to thinner arrows 3 6e and 4 6e<br>
located more superficially. There is excessive and highly<br>
variable scattering of photons when passing through various<br>
layers such as fat and other tissues such as muscles<br>
leading to thermal loss.<br>
Contrary to that, the tunnel area 20 is homogeneous<br>
with no absorption of infrared energy and the blood vessels<br>
are located on the surface. This allows undisturbed<br>
delivery of infrared energy to the surface of the skin 19<br>
and to a temperature detector such as an infrared detector<br>
placed in apposition to said skin 19. In the BTT area there<br>
is no thermal gradient since there is only a thin layer of<br>
skin 19 with terminal blood vessel 17 directly underneath<br>
said thin interface skin 19. The thermal energy 16<br>
generated by the terminal blood vessel 17 exiting to the<br><br>
surface skin 19 corresponds to the undisturbed brain (true<br>
core) temperature of the body. The preferred path for<br>
achieving thermal equilibrium with brain tissue temperature<br>
is through the central venous system which exits the brain<br>
and enters the orbit as the superior ophthalmic vein. The<br>
arterial blood is 0.2 to 0.3 degrees Celsius lower when<br>
compared to the central venous blood, and said arterial<br>
blood is not the actual equivalent of the brain<br>
temperature. Thus although arterial blood may be of<br>
interest in certain occasions, the venous system is the<br>
preferred carrier of thermal energy for measurement of<br>
brain temperature. Arterial blood temperature may be of<br>
interest to determine . possible brain cooling by the<br>
arterial blood in certain circumstances.<br>
Non-tunnel areas 30 and 40 are characterized by the<br>
presence of heat absorbing elements. The non-tunnel areas<br>
30- and 40 are defined by broken lines characterizing the<br>
vulnerability of interference by heat absorbing<br>
constituents and by the disorganized transferring of heat<br>
in said non-tunnel areas 30 and 40. Various layers and<br>
other constituents in non-tunnel areas 30 and 40<br>
selectively absorb infrared energy emitted by the deeper<br>
layers before said energy reaches the surface of skin, and<br>
the different thermal energy and the different areas are<br><br>
represented by the different shapes and sizes of arrows and<br>
arrow heads.<br>
Non-tunnel area 3 0 can be representative of measuring<br>
temperature with a sensor on top of the skin anatomically<br>
located above the heart 32. White arrows 3 4 represent the<br>
thermal energy in the heart 32. Non-tunnel area 30 includes<br>
the heart 3 2 and the various blood vessels and its branches<br>
3 6a, 3 6b, 3 6c, 3 6d storing thermal energy.<br>
Different amounts of heat are transferred and<br>
different temperatures measured depending on the location<br>
and anatomy of blood vessels 36a, 36b, 36c. The blood<br>
vessels branch out extensively from the main trunk 34a.<br>
The non-tunnel area 30 also includes heat absorbing<br>
structures 37 such as bone and muscles which thermal energy<br>
34 from the heart 32 need to be traversed to reach the skin<br>
39. The non-tunnel area 30 also includes a variable layer<br>
of fat tissue 38 which further absorbs thermal energy. The<br>
reduced amount of thermal energy reaching the skin surface<br>
3 9 due to the presence of fat 3 8 is represented by the<br>
arrows 3 6d and 3 6e, in which arrow 3 6d has higher<br>
temperature than arrow 3 6e. Non-tunnel area 30 also<br>
includes a thick skin 39 with low heat flow represented by<br>
arrows 36f.<br><br>
The thick skin 39 corresponds to the skin in the chest<br>
area and fat layer 38 corresponds to the variable amount of<br>
fat present in the chest area. Arrows 36g represent the<br>
disordered and reduced total radiant power delivered after<br>
said thermal energy traverses the interfering constituents<br>
in the non-tunnel area including a thick interface and heat<br>
absorbing structures. In addition, BTT 20 has no fat layer<br>
as found in non-tunnel areas 30 and 40. Lack of a thick<br>
interface, such as thick skin and fat, lack of thermal<br>
barriers such as fat, and lack of heat absorbing elements<br>
such as muscles allows undisturbed emission of radiation at<br>
the end of the BTT. Lack of a thick interface such as<br>
thick skin and fat, lack of thermal barriers such as fat,<br>
and lack of heat absorbing elements such as muscles allowed<br>
undisturbed emission of radiation at the end of the BTT.<br>
Yet referring to FIG. 2, non-tunnel area 40 can be<br>
representative of measuring temperature with a sensor on<br>
top of the skin in the arm 42. The heat transfer in non-<br>
tunnel area 40 has some similarity with non-tunnel area 30<br>
in which the end result is a disordered and reduced total<br>
radiant power not representative of the temperature at the<br>
opposite end internally. The blood vessels branch out<br>
extensively from the main trunk 44a. Thermal energy and<br>
temperature in blood vessels 46a, 46b, 46c is different<br><br>
than in areas 36a, 36b, 36c. The structures that thermal<br>
energy 44 needs to traverse to reach the skin are also<br>
different compared to non-tunnel 30. The amount of heat<br>
absorbing structures 47 is different and thus the end<br>
temperature at non-tunnel 40 is also different when <br>
compared to non-tunnel area 30. The amount of fat 48 also<br>
varies which changes the energy in areas 46d and 46e,<br>
wherein area 46d is deeper than area 46e. Thick skin 49<br>
also reduces heat flow and the temperature of the area 46f.<br>
Reduction of radiant power indicated by arrow 46g when<br>
compared to radiant power 36g is usually quite different,<br>
so different skin temperature is measured depending on the<br>
area of the body. This applies to the whole skin surface of<br>
the body, with the exception of the skin at the end of the<br>
BTT.<br>
Measurements of internal temperature such as rectal do<br>
not have the same clinical relevance as measurement in the<br>
brain. Selective brain cooling has been demonstrated in a<br>
number of mammalian species under laboratory conditions and<br>
the same process could occur in humans. For instance the<br>
temperature in bladder and rectum may be quite different<br>
than the brain. High or low temperature in the brain may<br>
not be reflected in the temperature measured in other<br>
internal organs.<br><br>
FIG. 2B is a cross-sectional schematic diagram of the<br>
human head 9 showing the brain 10, spinal cord 10a, the<br>
tunnel 2 0 represented by the superior ophthalmic vein, the<br>
cavernous sinus 1, which is the thermal energy storage<br>
compartment for the brain, and the various insulating<br>
barriers 2, 2a, 3, 4, 4a, 4b, 5 that keep the brain as a<br>
completely thermally insulated structure. Insulating<br>
barriers include skin 2 corresponding to the scalp, skin 2a<br>
corresponding to the skin covering the face, fat 3 covering<br>
the whole surface of the skull and face, skull bone 4, .<br>
spinal bone 4a surrounding spinal, cord 10a, facial bone 4b<br>
covering the face, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 5. The<br>
combined thickness of barriers 2,3,4,5 insulating the brain<br>
can reach 1.5 cm to 2.0 cm, which is a notable thickness<br>
and the largest single barrier against the environment in<br>
the whole body. Due to this completely confined environment<br>
the brain cannot remove heat efficiently and heat loss<br>
occurs at a very low rate. Skin 2 corresponds to the scalp<br>
which is the skin . and associated structure covering the<br>
skull and which has low thermal conductivity and works as<br>
an insulator. Fat tissue 3 absorbs the majority of the.far-<br>
infrared wavelength and works as a thermal buffer. Skull<br>
bone 4 has low thermal conductivity and' the CSF works as a<br>
physical buffer and has zero heat production.<br><br>
The heat generated by metabolic rate in the brain<br>
corresponds to 20% of the total heat produced by the body<br>
and this enormous amount of heat is kept in a confined and<br>
thermally sealed space. Brain tissue is the most<br>
susceptible tissue to thermal energy induced damage, both<br>
high and low levels of thermal energy Because of the<br>
thermal insulation and physical inability of the brain to<br>
gain heat or lose heat, both hypothermic (cold) and<br>
hyperthermic (hot) states can lead to brain damage and<br>
 death can rapidly ensue, as occur to thousands of healthy<br>
people annually besides seizures and death due to high<br>
fever in sick people. Unless appropriate and timely warning<br>
is provided by continuously monitoring brain temperature<br>
anyone affected by cold or hot disturbances is at risk of<br>
thermal induced damage to the brain.<br>
FIG. 2B also shows a notably small entry point 20a<br>
measuring less than 0.5% of the body surface which<br>
corresponds to the end of the tunnel 20 on the skin 2b. The<br>
skin 2b is extremely thin with a thickness of 1 mm or less<br>
compared to the skin 2 and 2a which are five fold or more,<br>
thicker than skin 2b.<br>
The tunnel 20 starts at the cavernous sinus 1 which is<br>
a conduit for venous drainage for the brain and for heat,<br>
transfer at the end of the tunnel 20 as a radiant energy.<br><br>
Tunnel 20 provides an unobstructed passage to the cavernous<br>
sinus 1, a structure located in the middle of the brain,<br>
and which is in direct contact with the two sources of heat<br>
to the brain: 1) thermal energy produced due to metabolic<br>
rate by the brain and carried by the venous system; and 2)<br>
thermal energy delivered by the arterial supply from the<br>
rest of the body to the brain. This direct contact<br>
arrangement is showed in detail in FIG. 2C, which is a<br>
coronal section of FIG. 2B corresponding to the line marked<br>
"A"<br>
FIG. 2C is a coronal section through the cavernous<br>
sinus 1 which is a cavity-like structure with multiple<br>
spaces la filled with venous blood from the veins 9 and<br>
from the superior ophthalmic vein 6. Cavernous sinus 1<br>
collects thermal energy from brain tissue 7, from arterial<br>
blood of the right and left internal carotid arteries 8a,<br>
8b, and from venous blood from vein 9. All of the<br>
structures 7, 8a, 8b, 9 are disposed along and in intimate<br>
contact with the cavernous sinus 1. A particular feature<br>
that makes the cavernous sinus 1 of the tunnel a very<br>
useful gauge for temperature disturbances is the intimate<br>
association with the carotid arteries 8a, 8b. The carotid<br>
arteries carry the blood from the body, and the amount of <br>
thermal energy delivered to the brain by said vessels can<br><br>
lead to a state of hypothermia or hyperthermia. For<br>
instance during exposure to cold, the body is cold and cold<br>
blood from the body is carried to the brain by internal<br>
carotid arteries 8a, 8b, and the cavernous sinus 1 is the<br>
entry point of those vessels 8a, 8b to the brain.<br>
As soon as cold blood reaches the cavernous sinus 1<br>
the corresponding thermal energy state is transferred to<br>
the tunnel and to the skin- surface at the end of the<br>
tunnel, providing therefore an immediate alert even before<br>
the cold blood is distributed throughout the brain. The<br>
same applies to hot blood for instance generated during<br>
exercise which can lead to a 20 fold heat production<br>
compared to baseline. This heat carried by vessels 8a, 8b<br>
is transferred to the cavernous sinus l and can be measured<br>
at the, end of the tunnel. In addition, the thermal energy<br>
generated by the brain is carried by cerebral venous blood<br>
and the cavernous sinus 1 is a structure filled with venous<br>
blood.<br>
FIG. 3A is a thermal infrared image of the human face<br>
in which the geometry of the end of the tunnel on the skin<br>
can be visualised. The white bright spots define the<br>
central area of the tunnel. FIG. 3B is a schematic diagram<br>
of an exemplary geometry on the skin surface at the end of<br>
the tunnel. The medial aspect 52 of the tunnel 50 has a<br><br>
round shape. The lateral aspect 54 borders the upper lid<br>
margin 58 and caruncle 56 of the eye 60. The tunnel extends<br>
from the medial canthal area 52 into the upper eyelid 62 in<br>
a horn like projection.<br>
The internal areas of the tunnel 50 include the<br>
general area for the main entry point and the main entry<br>
point as shown in PIGS. 4A to 5D. FIG. 4A is a thermal<br>
infrared image of the side of the human face showing a<br>
general view of the main entry point of the brain<br>
temperature tunnel, seen as white bright points located<br>
medial and above the medial canthal corner. FIG. 4B is a<br>
diagram showing the general area 70 of the main entry point<br>
and its relationship to the eye 60, medial canthal corner<br>
61, eyebrow 64, and nose 66. The general area 70 of the<br>
main entry point provides an area with more faithful<br>
reproduction of the brain temperature since the area 70 has<br>
less interfering elements than the peripheral area of the<br>
tunnel.<br>
FIG. SA is a thermal infrared image of the front of<br>
the human face with the right" eye closed showing the main<br>
entry point of the brain temperature tunnel seen as white<br>
bright spots above and medial to the medial canthal corner.<br>
With closed eyes it is easy to observe that the radiant,<br>
power is coming solely from the skin at the end of BTT.<br><br>
FIG. 5B is a diagram showing the main entry point 80<br>
and its relationship to the medial canthal corner 61 of<br>
closed eye 60 and eyelids 62. The main entry point 80 of<br>
the tunnel provides the area with the most faithful<br>
reproduction of the brain, temperature since the area 80 has<br>
the least amount of interfering elements and is universally<br>
present in all human beings at an equivalent anatomical<br>
position. The main entry point 80 has the highest total<br>
radiant .power and has a surface with high emissivity. The<br>
 main entry point 80 is located on the skin in the superior<br>
aspect of the medial canthal area 63, in the supero-medial<br>
aspect of the medial canthal corner 61.<br>
FIG. 5C is a thermal infrared image of the side of the<br>
human face in FIG. 5A with the left eye closed showing a<br>
side view of the main entry point of the brain temperature<br>
tunnel, seen as bright white spots. It can be observed with<br>
closed eyes that the radiant power is coming solely from<br>
the skin at the end of BTT.<br>
FIG. 5D shows the main entry point 80 in the superior<br>
aspect of the medial canthal area above the medial canthal<br>
corner 61, and also shows the position of main entry point<br>
80 in relation to the eye 60, eyebrow 64 and nose 66.<br>
Support structures can precisely position sensing devices <br>
on top of the main entry point of the tunnel because the<br><br>
main entry point is completely demarcated by anatomic<br>
landmarks. In general the sensor is positioned on the<br>
medial canthal skin area above the medial canthal corner<br>
and adjacent to the eye. Although indicators can be placed<br>
on support structures to better guide the positioning of<br>
the sensor, the universal presence of the various permanent<br>
anatomic landmarks allows the precise positioning by any<br>
non-technical person.<br>
The main entry point is the preferred location for the<br>
 positioning of the sensor by the support structure, but the<br>
placement of a sensor in any part of the end of the tunnel<br>
including the general entry point area and peripheral area<br>
provides clinically useful measurements depending on the<br>
application. The degree of precision needed for the<br>
measurement will determine the positioning of the sensor.<br>
In cases of neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery, or other<br>
surgical procedures in which the patient is at high risk of<br>
hypothermia or malignant hyperthermia, the preferred<br>
position of the sensor is at the main entry point. For<br>
recreational or professional sports, military, workers,<br>
fever detection at home, wrinkle protection in sunlight,<br>
and the like, positioning the sensor in any part of the end<br>
of the tunnel area provides the precision needed for,<br>
clinical usefulness.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, FIG. 6 is a<br>
schematic view of the face showing the general area of the<br>
main entry point of the tunnel 90 and the overall area of<br>
the end of the tunnel and its relationship to the medial<br>
canthal tendon 67. The end of the tunnel includes the<br>
general main entry point area 90 and the upper eyelid area<br>
94. The area 90 has a peripheral portion 92. Both medial<br>
canthal areas have a medial canthal tendon and the left eye<br>
is used to facilitate the illustration. The medial canthal<br>
tendon 67 arises at the medial canthal corner 61 of eye 60.<br>
The left medial canthal tendon 67 is diametrically opposed<br>
to the right medial canthal tendon as shown by broken lines<br>
61a which begins at the medial corner of the eye 61.<br>
Although the main entry point is above the medial canthal<br>
tendon 67, some of the peripheral area 92 of the tunnel is<br>
located below tendon 67.<br>
Fig. 6A is a schematic diagram showing two physiologic<br>
tunnels. The upper figure shows the area corresponding to<br>
the BTT 10 . The lower figure shows an area corresponding<br>
to a metabolic tunnel 13 which includes the upper eyelid<br>
area 13a and lower eyelid area 13b seen as light blue areas<br>
in FIG. 1B. For measuring the concentration of chemical<br>
substances the total radiant power is not mandatory. The<br>
key aspect for clinical useful spectroscopic measurements<br><br>
is signal coming from the cerebral area and the reduction<br>
or elimination of interfering constituents, and the main<br>
interfering constituent is adipose tissue. By removing<br>
adipose tissue and receiving spectral information carried<br>
by a vasculature from the brain, precise and clinical<br>
measurements can be achieved. The sensors supported by<br>
support structure are adapted to have a field of view that<br>
matches in total or in part the metabolic tunnel 13 for<br>
capturing thermal radiation from said tunnel 13.<br>
To determine the thermal stability of the tunnel area<br>
in relation to environmental changes, cold and heat<br>
challenge tests were performed. FIGS. 7A and 7B are thermal<br>
infrared images of an exemplary experiment showing the<br>
human face before and after cold challenge. In FIG. 7A the<br>
face has a lighter appearance when compared to FIG. 7B<br>
which is darker indicating a lower temperature. The nose in<br>
FIG. 7A has an overall whitish appearance as compared to<br>
the nose in FIG. 7B which has an overall darker appearance.<br>
Since the areas outside the tunnel have thermoregulatory<br>
arteriovenous shunts and interfering constituents including<br>
fat, the changes in the temperature of the environment are<br>
reflected in said areas. Thus measurements in those non-<br>
tunnel areas of the face reflect the environment instead of<br>
the actual body temperature. The non-tunnel areas of the<br><br>
skin in the face and body can change with the changes in<br>
ambient temperature. The radiant power, of the tunnel area<br>
remains stable and there is no change in the amount of<br>
thermal energy demonstrating the stability of the thermal<br>
emission of the BTT area. Changes of thermal radiation at<br>
the tunnel area only occur when the brain temperature<br>
changes, which provides the most reliable measurement, of<br>
the thermal status of the body.<br>
PIGS, 8A and 8B are thermal infrared images of the<br>
human face of different subjects showing the tunnel seen as<br>
bright white spots in the medial canthal area. The<br>
physiologic tunnel is universally present in all<br>
individuals despite anatomic variations and ethnic<br>
differences. FIGS. 9A and 9B are thermal infrared image<br>
showing that the tunnel seen as bright white spots are<br>
equally present in animals, illustrated here by a cat (FIG:<br>
9A) and a dog (FIG. 9B).<br>
A preferred embodiment includes a temperature sensor<br>
with measurement processing electronics housed in a patch-<br>
like support structure which positions a passive sensor<br>
directly in contact with the skin over the brain<br>
temperature tunnel site. Accordingly, FIG. 10 is a<br>
perspective view of a preferred embodiment showing a person <br>
100 wearing a support structure comprised of a patch 72<br><br>
with a passive sensor 74 positioned on the skin at the end<br>
of the tunnel. Person 10 0 is laying on a mattress. 76 which<br>
contains antenna 78. Wire 82 extends from antenna 78 to<br>
controller unit 84 with said controller 84 communicating<br>
with device 88 by communication line 86. Exemplary device<br>
8 8 includes a decoding and display unit at the bedside or<br>
at the nursing station. It is understood that controller<br>
unit 84 besides communicating by cable 86, can also contain<br>
a wireless transmission device to wirelessly transmit the<br>
signal acquired to a remote station. This inductive radio<br>
frequency powered telemetry system can use the same antenna<br>
78 to transfer energy and to receive the signal.<br>
The antenna 78 can be secured to a mattress, pillow, <br>
frame of a bed, and the like in a removable or permanent<br>
manner. The preferred embodiment includes a thin flat<br>
antenna encapsulated by a flexible polymer that is secured<br>
to a mattress and is not visible to the user. Alternatively<br>
an antenna can be placed in any area surrounding the<br>
patient, such as on a night stand.<br>
The antenna 78 and controller unit 84 works as a<br>
receiver/interrogator. A receiver/interrogator antenna 78<br>
causes RF energy to radiate to the microcircuit in the<br>
patch 72. This energy would be stored and converted for use <br>
in the temperature measurement process and in the<br><br>
transmission of the data from the patch 72 to the antenna<br>
78. Once sufficient energy has been transferred, the<br>
microcircuit makes the measurement and transmits that data<br>
to the receiver/interrogator antenna 78 with said data<br>
being processed at controller 84 and further communicated<br>
to device 88 for display or further transmission. The<br>
switching elements involved in the acquisition of the<br>
sensor data (measurement of the energy) is done in a<br>
sequence so that the quantitized answer is available and<br>
stored prior to the activation of the noise-rich<br>
transmission signal. Thus the two inherently incompatible<br>
processes successfully coexist because they are not active<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The capability of the RF link to communicate in the<br>
presence of noise is accomplished by "spreading" the<br>
spectral content of the transmitted energy in a way that<br>
would inherently add redundancy to the transmission while<br>
reducing the probability that the transmission can ever be<br>
interpreted by the receiver/interrogator 78 as another<br>
transmission or noise that would cause the<br>
receiver/interrogator 78 to transmit and display incorrect<br>
information. This wireless transmission scheme can be<br>
implemented with very few active elements. The modulation<br>
purposely spreads the transmission energy across the<br><br>
spectrum and thus provides noise immunity and the system<br>
can be ultimately produced via batch processing and thus at<br>
a very low cost.<br>
Since the energy to operate sensor 74 in patch 72<br>
comes from the antenna 78, the microcircuit in said patch<br>
72 can be very small and ultra-thin. Size of the patch 72<br>
would be further minimized to extremely small dimensions by<br>
the design approach that places all the processing function<br>
of the RF link in the controller unit 84 working as a<br>
receiver. RF messaging protocol and the control of the<br>
sensor 74 resides in the receiver/interrogator controller<br>
84 powered by commercially available batteries or by AC<br>
current. Thus the RF messaging protocol and the control of<br>
the sensor 74 is directly controlled by the MCU of<br>
controller 84. The circuit resident in the patch 72 is<br>
preferably completely self-contained. The sensing system 74<br>
in the patch 72 is preferably a silicon microcircuit<br>
containing the circuits needed to support the sensor,<br>
quantatize the data from the sensor, encode the data for<br>
radio frequency transmission, and transmit the data,<br>
besides power conditioning circuits and digital state<br>
control. Sensor, support circuitry, RF power and<br>
communications are all deposited on a micro-chip die <br>
allowing the circuit to be built in large quantities and at<br><br>
very low cost. This scheme is preferably used for both<br>
passive and active devices.<br>
The operational process can consist of two modes,<br>
manual or automated. In the manual mode, an operator such<br>
as a nurse activates the system and RF energy radiated to<br>
the microcircuit in the patch 72 would be stored and<br>
converted for use in the temperature measurement process<br>
and in the transmission of the data from the end of the BTT<br>
to the antenna 78. Once sufficient energy has been<br>
transferred (less than 1 second) the microcircuit would<br>
make the measurement and transmit the data to the antenna<br>
78 receiver and controller 84 to be displayed for example<br>
on a back-lit LCD display at the nursing station. An audio<br>
"beep" will signal that the data had been received and is<br>
ready for view. In the automated mode, the process is done<br>
automatically and continuously by interrogation at preset<br>
frequency and an alarm being activated when the reading is<br>
outside the specified range. A tri-dimensional antenna can<br>
also be used and the controller 84 set up to search the<br>
three dimensions of the antenna to assure continued and<br>
proper connection between antenna 78 and sensing means 74.<br>
It is also understood that the sensor can modulate<br>
reflected RF energy. Accordingly, the energy will trigger<br>
the unit to acquire a temperature measurement, and then the<br><br>
unit will modulate the reflected energy. This reflected<br>
energy and information will be received at the interrogator<br>
and displayed as above.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
monitoring biological parameters, which comprises the steps<br>
of: securing a passive sensor to the body; generating<br>
electromagnetic radiation from a device secured to at least<br>
one of a mattress, a pillow and the frame of a bed;<br>
generating a signal from said passive sensor; receiving<br>
said signal by a device secured to at least one of a<br>
mattress, a pillow and the frame of a bed; and determining<br>
the value of the biological parameter based on said signal.<br>
It is understood that a variety of external power<br>
sources such as electromagnetic coupling can be used<br><br>
including an ultra-capacitor charged externally through<br>
electromagnetic induction coupling and cells that can be<br>
recharged by an external oscillator. It is also understood<br>
that the sensing system can be remotely driven by .<br>
ultrasonic waves.<br>
FIG. 11 is a perspective view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing in closer detail a person 100 wearing a<br>
support structure comprised of patch 72 with a sensor 74,<br>
transmitter 71, and digital converter and control 73<br>
positioned on the skin at the end of the tunnel. Person 100<br><br>
is wearing a necklace which works as antenna 78 and a<br>
pendant in the necklace works as the controller unit and<br>
transmitting unit 79. Solar cells and/or specialized<br>
batteries power unit 79. Patients are used to carrying<br>
Holter monitoring and cards with cords around their necks<br>
and this embodiment can fit well with those currently used<br>
systems. It is understood that, besides a necklace, a<br>
variety of articles including clothing and electric devices<br>
can be used as a receiver/interrogator and this capability<br>
can be easily incorporated into cell phones, note book<br>
computers, hand held computers, internet appliances for<br>
connecting to the internet, and the like, so a patient<br>
could use his/her cell phone or computer means to monitor<br>
his/her brain temperature.<br>
The preferred embodiments shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 can<br>
preferably provide continuous monitoring of fever or<br>
temperature spikes for any surgery, for any patient<br>
admitted to a hospital, for nursing home patients, in<br>
ambulances, and to prevent death or harm by hospital<br>
infection. Hospital infection is an infection acquired<br>
during a hospital stay. Hospital infection is the fourth<br>
cause of death in the U.S. and kills more than 100,000<br>
patients annually and occurs primarily due to lack of early <br>
identification of fever or temperature spikes. The present<br><br>
invention provides timely identification and therapy of an<br>
infection due to 24 hour automated monitoring of<br>
temperature. If there is a spike in temperature an alarm<br>
can be activated. This will allow timely identification and<br>
treatment of an infection and thus prevent death or costly<br>
complications such as septic shock that can occur due to<br>
delay in treating infectious processes. Besides, said <br>
preferred embodiments provide means for continuous fever<br>

children and adults.<br>
FIG. 12A is a front perspective view of a preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person 100 wearing a support structure<br>
comprised of a patch 109 with indicator lines 111 and<br>
containing an active sensor 102 positioned on the skin at<br>
the end of the tunnel. The preferred embodiment shown in<br>
FIG. 12 provides a transmitting device 104, a processing<br>
device 106, AD converter 107 and a sensing device 102<br>
connected by flexible circuit 110 to power source 108. For<br>
example the transmitting module can include RF, sound or<br>
light. FIG. 12B is a side schematic view showing the<br>
flexible nature of the support structure in FIG, 12A with<br>
flexible circuit 110 connecting microelectronic package 103<br>
which contains a transmitting device means, a processing<br>
device and a sensing device in the right side of the patch<br><br>
109 and the power source 108 in the left side of said patch<br>
109. Exemplary embodiments will be described.<br>
In accordance with this exemplary embodiment for<br>
temperature measurement, the thermal energy emitted by the<br>
BTT is sensed by the temperature sensor 102 such as a<br>
miniature thermistor which produces a signal representing<br>
the thermal energy sensed. The signal is then converted to<br>
digital information and processed by processor 106 using<br>
standard processing for determining the temperature. An<br>
exemplary sonic-based system for brain temperature<br>
measurement comprises a temperature sensor, input coupling<br>
circuit, signal processing circuit, output coupling circuit<br>
and output display circuit. A temperature sensor 102 (e.g.,<br>
thermistor) in a patch 109 placed on the surface of the<br>
skin at the medial canthal area responds to variations in<br>
brain temperature which is manifested as a DC voltage<br>
signal.<br>
This signal, coupled to a Signal Processor Circuit via<br>
an Input Coupling Circuit is used to modulate the output of<br>
an oscillator, e.g., a multivibrator circuit, piezoelectric<br>
systems operating in or just above the audio frequency<br>
range. The oscillator is a primary component of the Signal<br>
Processor Circuit. The output of the oscillator is input to,<br><br>
an amplifier, which is the second primary component of the<br>
Signal Processor.<br>
The amplifier increases the output level from the<br>
oscillator so that the output of the Signal Processor is<br>
sufficient to drive an Output Display Circuit. Depending<br>
on the nature of the Output Display Circuit, e.g., an audio<br>
speaker, a visual LED display, or other possible display<br>
embodiment, an Output Coupling Circuit is utilized to match<br>
the signal from the Signal Processor Circuit to the Output<br>
Display Circuit. For an Output Display Circuit that<br>
requires a digital input signal, the Output Coupling<br>
Circuit might include an analog to digital (A/D) converter<br>
circuit. A DC power supply circuit is the remaining<br>
primary component in the Signal Processor Module. The DC<br>
power supply is required to support the operation of the<br>
oscillator and the amplifier in the Signal Processing<br>
Circuit. Embodiments of the DC power supply can include<br>
ultra miniature DC batteries, a light sensitive DC power<br>
source, or some combination of the two, and the like. The<br>
micro transducers, signal processing electronics,<br>
transmitters and power source can be preferably constructed<br>
as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit or as a<br>
hybrid circuit alone or in combination with MEMS (micro<br>
electrical mechanical systems) technology.<br><br>
The thermistor voltage is input to a microcontroller<br>
unit, i.e., a single chip microprocessor, which is pre-<br>
programmed to process the thermistor voltage into a digital<br>
signal which corresponds to the patient's measured<br>
temperature in degrees C (or degrees F) at the BTT site. It<br>
is understood that different programming and schemes can be<br>
used. For example, the sensor voltage can be directly fed<br>
into the microcontroller for conversion to a temperature<br>
value and then displayed on a screen as a temperature<br>
value, e.g., 98.6° F. On the other hand the voltage can be<br>
processed through an analog to digital converter (ADC)<br>
before it is input to the microcontroller.<br>
The microcontroller output, after additional signal<br>
conditioning, serves as the driver for a piezoelectric<br>
audio frequency (ultrasonic) transmitter. The piezoelectric<br>
transmitter wirelessly sends digital pulses that, can be<br>
recognized by software in a clock radio sized receiver<br>
module consisting of a microphone, low-pass audio filter,<br>
amplifier, microcontroller unit, local temperature display<br>
and pre-selected temperature level alert mechanism. The<br>
signal processing software is pre-programmed into the<br>
microcontroller unit of the receiver. Although the present<br>
invention provides means for RF transmission in the<br>
presence of noise, this particular embodiment using a<br><br>
microphone as the receiving unit may offer additional<br>
advantages in the hospital setting since there is zero RF<br>
interference with the many other RF devices usually present<br>
in said setting. The microcontroller unit drives a<br>
temperature display for each patient being monitored. Each<br>
transmitter is tagged with its own ID. Thus one receiver<br>
module can be used for various patients. A watch, cell<br>
phone, and the like adapted with a microphone can also work<br>
as the receiver module.<br>
In another embodiment the output of the<br>
microcontroller is used to drive a piezo-electric buzzer.<br>
The microcontroller output drives the piezo-electric buzzer<br>
to alert the user of the health threatening situation. In<br>
this design the output of the microcontroller may be fed<br>
into a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that transforms<br>
the digital data signal from the microcontroller to an<br>
equivalent analog signal which is used to drive the buzzer.<br>
In yet another embodiment the output from the (DAC) is<br>
used to drive a speech synthesizer chip programmed to<br>
output an appropriate audio warning to the user, for<br>
instance an athlete at risk of heatstroke. For a sensed<br>
temperature above 39 degrees Celsius the message might be:<br>
"Your Body temperature is High. Seek shade. Drink cold<br>
liquid. Rest." For temperature below 36 degrees Celsius<br><br>
the message might be; "Your Body temperature is Low. Seek<br>
shelter from the Cold. Drink warm liquid. Warm up."<br>
In another embodiment the output is used to drive a<br>
light transmitter programmed to output an appropriate light<br>
signal. The transmitter consists of an infrared light that<br>
is activated when the temperature reaches a certain level.<br>
The light signal will work as a remote control unit that<br>
activates a remote unit that sounds an alarm. This<br>
embodiment for instance can alert the parents during the<br>
night when the child is sleeping and has a temperature<br>
spike.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the platform for local<br>
reporting consists of three electronic modules mechanically<br>
housed in a fabric or plastic holder such as patch 109,<br>
which contain a sensor 102 positioned on the skin at the<br>
BTT site. The modules are: Temperature Sensor Module,<br>
Microcontroller Module, and Output Display Module in<br>
addition to a battery, to electronic interface is used<br>
between each module for the overall device to properly<br>
function. The configuration of this system consists of a<br>
strip such as patch 109 attached to the BTT area by a self-<br>
adhesive pad. A thermistor coupled to a microcontroller<br>
drives an audio frequency piezoelectric transmitter or LED.<br>
The system provides local reporting of temperature without<br><br>
a receiver. An audio tone or light will alert the user when<br>
certain thresholds are met. The tone can work as a chime or<br>
reproduction of human voice.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment for remote reporting<br>
consists of four electronic modules. Sensor Module,<br>
Microcontroller Module, Output Transmitter Module and<br>
Receiver/Monitor Module. From a mechanical viewpoint the<br>
first three modules are virtually identical to the first<br>
embodiment. Electronically the Temperature Sensor and<br>
Microprocessor Modules are identical to the previous<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment an Output Transmitter Module<br>
replaces the previous local Output Display Module. Output<br>
Transmitter Module is designed to transmit wirelessly the<br>
temperature results determined by the Microprocessor Module<br>
to a remotely located Receiver/Monitor Module. An<br>
electronic interface is used between each module for proper<br>
function. This device can be utilized by patients in a<br>
hospital or home setting. On a continuous basis temperature<br>
levels can be obtained by accessing data provided by the<br>
Receiver/Monitor Module.<br>
A variety of temperature sensing elements can be used<br>
as a temperature sensor including a thermistor,<br>
thermocouple, or RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector),<br>
platinum wire, surface mounted sensors, semiconductors,<br><br>
thermoelectric systems which measure surface temperature,<br>
optic fiber which fluoresces, bimetallic devices, liquid<br>
expansion devices, and change-of-state devices, heat flux<br>
sensor, crystal thermometry and reversible temperature<br>
indicators including liquid Crystal Mylar sheets. A<br>
preferred temperature sensor includes thermistor model<br>
104JT available from Shibaura of Japan.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a block diagram of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention linking transmitter 120<br>
to receiver 130. Transmitter 120 preferably includes a chip<br>
112 incorporating a microcontroller (MCU) 114, a radio<br>
frequency transmitter (RF) 116 and a A/D converter 118 in<br>
addition to a power source 122, amplifier (A) 124, sensor<br>
12 6, and antenna 12 8, preferably built-in in the chip.<br>
Exemplary chips include: (1) rfPIC12F675F, (available from<br>
Microchip Corporation, Arizona, USA) this is a MCU + ADC +<br>
433Mhz Transmitter (2) CC1010, available from Chipcon<br>
Corporation of Norway.<br>
Receiver 130 preferably includes a chip RF transceiver<br>
132 (e.g., CC1000 available from Chipcon Corporation), a<br>
microcontroller unit (MCU) 134, amplifier and filtering<br>
units (A/F) 136, display 138, clock 140, keypad 142, LED<br>
144, speaker 146, in addition to a power source 150 and<br><br>
input/output units (I/O) 148 and associated modem 152,<br>
optical transceiver 154 and communication ports.156.<br>
A. variety of devices can be used for the transmission<br>
scheme besides the commercially available RF transmitter<br>
chips previously mentioned. One simple transmission devices<br>
include an apparatus with a single channel transmitter in<br>
the 916.48 MHz band that sends the temperature readings to<br>
a bed side receiver as a frequency proportional to the<br>
reading. The thermistor's resistance would control the<br>
frequency of an oscillator feeding the RF transmitter data<br>
input. If the duty cycle is less than 1%, the 318 MHz band<br>
would be usable. Rather than frequency, a period<br>
measurement technique can be used. The model uses a simple<br>
radio frequency carrier as the information transport and<br>
modulating that carrier with the brain temperature<br>
information derived from a transduction device capable of<br>
changing its electrical characteristics as a function of<br>
temperature (e.g.; thermistor). Either frequency or<br>
amplitude of the carrier would be modulated, by the<br>
temperature information so that a receiver tuned to that<br>
frequency could demodulate the changing carrier and recover<br>
the slowly moving temperature data.<br>
Another transmission technique suitable to transmit;<br>
the signal from a sensor in a support structure is a chirp<br><br>
device. This means that when activated, the transmitter<br>
outputs a carrier that starts at a lower frequency in the<br>
ISM band and smoothly increases frequency with time until a<br>
maximum frequency is reached. The brain temperature<br>
information is used to modify the rate of change of<br>
frequency of the chirp. The receiver is designed to<br>
measure the chirp input very accurately by looking for two<br>
or more specific frequencies. When the first of the<br>
frequencies is detected, a clock measures the elapsed time<br>
until the second frequency is received. Accordingly, a<br>
third, fourth, etc., frequency could be added to aid in the<br>
rejection of noise. Since virtually all the direct<br>
sequence spread spectrum transmitters and frequency hopping<br>
transmitters are spread randomly throughout their part of<br>
the ISM band, the probability of them actually producing<br>
the "right" sequence of frequencies at exactly the right<br>
time is remote.<br>
Once the receiver measured the timing between the<br>
target frequencies, that time is the value that would<br>
represent the brain temperature. If the expected second,<br>
third, or fourth frequency is not received by the receiver<br>
within a "known" time window, the receiver rejects the<br>
initial inputs as noise. This provides a spread spectrum <br>
system by using a wide spectrum for transmitting the<br><br>
information while encoding the information in a way that is<br>
unlike the expected noise from other users of the ISM<br>
band. The chirp transmitter is low cost and simple to build<br>
and the brain temperature transducer is one of the active<br>
elements that controls the rate of change of frequency.<br>
Other preferred embodiments for local reporting<br>
include a sensor, an operational amplifier (LM3 58 available<br>
from National Semicondutor Corporation) and a LED in<br>
addition to a power source. It is understood that the<br>
operational amplifier (Op Amp) can be substituted by a MCU<br>
and the LED substituted by a piezoelectric component.<br>
FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram showing the support<br>
structure 160 to a sensor 158, and MCU 164 controlling<br>
and/or adjusting unit 162. Communication between MCU 164<br>
and unit 162 is achieved by wires 168 or wirelessly 166. By<br>
way of example, but not by limitation, exemplary units 162<br>
include climate control units in cars, thermostats, vehicle<br>
seats, furniture, exercise machines, clothing, footwear,<br>
medical devices, drug pumps, and the like. For example, MCU<br>
164 is programmed with transmit the temperature level to<br>
receiver unit 162 in the exercise machine. MCU in the<br>
exercising machine unit 162 is programmed to adjust speed<br>
or other settings in accordance with the signal generated,<br>
by MCU 164.<br><br>
The preferred embodiment allows precise positioning of<br>
the sensing apparatus by the support structure on the BTT<br>
site. The support structure is designed to conform to the<br>
anatomical landmarks of the BTT area which assures proper<br>
placement of the sensor at all times. The corner of the eye<br>
is considered a permanent anatomic landmark, i.e., it is<br>
present in the same location in all human beings. The BTT<br>
area is also a permanent anatomic landmark as demonstrated<br>
by the present invention. To facilitate consistent<br>
placement at the BTT site, an indicator in the support<br>
structure can be used as shown in FIGS. 15A to 15E.<br>
FIG. 15A shows a Guiding Line 170 placed on the<br>
outside surface of the support structure 172. The Guiding<br>
Line 170 is lined up with the medial corner of the eye 174.<br>
The sensor 176 is located above the Guiding Line 170 and on<br>
the outer edge of the support structure 172, so once the<br>
Guiding Line 170 of the support structure 172 is lined up<br>
with the medial corner of the eye 174, the sensor 176 is<br>
positioned on the main entry point of the tunnel. Thus the<br>
support structure 172 can be precisely and consistently<br>
applied in a way to allow the sensor 176 to cover the BTT<br>
area at all times.<br>
FIG. 15B shows a different design of the patch 172 but-<br>
with the same Guiding Line 170 lined up with the medial<br><br>
corner of the eye 174, thus allowing consistent placement<br>
of sensor 176 at the BTT site despite the difference in<br>
design.<br>
FIG. 15C is another preferred embodiment showing the<br>
sensor 176 lined up with medial corner 174. Thus in this<br>
embodiment a Guiding Line is not required and the sensor<br>
176 itself guides the positioning.<br>
In FIG. 15D the MCU 175 and cell 177 of patch 172 are<br>
located outside of the BTT site while sensor 176 is<br>
'precisely positioned at the BTT site. It is understood that<br>
any type of indicator on the support structure can be used<br>
to allow proper placement in the BTT area including<br>
external marks, leaflets, cuts in the support structure,<br>
different geometry that lines up with the corner of the <br>
eye, and the like.<br>
FIG. 15E is another preferred embodiment showing the<br>
superior edge 176a of sensor 176 lined up with medial<br>
corner 174 and located in the inferior aspect of the medial<br>
cahthal area while microchip controller 175 is located in<br>
the superior aspect of the medial canthal area. Support<br>
structure 172 has a geometric indicator 179 comprised of a<br>
small recess on the support structure 172. It is understood<br>
that a strip working as support structure like an adhesive <br>
bandage can have the side opposite- to the sensor and<br><br>
hardware made with tear off pieces. The. sensor side is<br>
first attached to the skin and any excess strip can be<br>
easily torn off. Two sizes, adult and children cover all<br>
potential users.<br>
The material for the support structure working as a<br>
patch can be soft and have insulating properties such as<br>
are found in polyethylene. Depending on the application a<br>
multilayer structure of the patch can include from the<br>
external side to the skin side the following: thinsulate<br>
layer; double foam adhesive (polyethylene) ; sensor<br>
(thermistor); and a Mylar sheet. The sensor surface can be<br>
covered by the Mylar sheet, which in turn is surrounded by<br>
the adhesive side of the foam. Any soft thin material with<br>
high thermal resistance and low thermal conductivity can be<br>
preferably used as an interface between the sensor and the<br>
exterior, such as. polyurethane foam (K =0.02 W/m.C). Any<br>
support structure can incorporate the preferred insulation<br>
material.<br>
A preferred power source for the patch includes<br>
natural thermoelectrics as disclosed by the present<br>
invention. In addition, standard lightweight thin plastic<br>
batteries using a combination of plastics such as<br>
f luorophenylthiophenes as electrodes can be used, and are.<br>
flexible allowing better conformation with the anatomy of<br><br>
the BTT site. Another exemplary suitable power source<br>
includes a light weight ultra-thin solid state lithium<br>
battery comprised of a semisolid plastic electrolyte which<br>
are about 300 microns thick.<br>
The system can have two modes: at room temperature the<br>
system is quiet and at body temperature the system is<br>
activated. The system can also have an on/off switch by<br>
creating a circuit using skin resistance, so only when the<br>
sensor is. placed on the skin is the system activated. The<br>
patch can also have a built-in switch in which peeling off<br>
a conductive backing opens the circuit (pads) and turn the<br>
system on. In addition, when removed from the body, the<br>
patch can be placed in a case containing a magnet. The<br>
magnet in the case acts as an off switch and transmission<br>
is terminated when said patch is in the case.<br>
FIG. ISA to 16C are perspective views of preferred<br>
embodiments showing a person 100 wearing support structures<br>
180 incorporated as patches. In a preferred embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 16A, the support structure 180 contains LED<br>
184, cell 186, and sensor 182. Sensor 182 is positioned at<br>
a main entry point on the superior aspect of the medial<br>
canthal area adjacent to the medial corner of the eye 25.<br>
LED 184 is activated when a signal reaches certain<br>
thresholds in accordance with the principles of the<br><br>
invention. FIG. 16B is another preferred embodiment showing<br>
a person 100 wearing support structure 180 with sensor 182<br>
positioned at the general area of the main entry point of<br>
the tunnel with the superior edge 181 of support structure<br>
180 being lined up with the corner of the eye 25. Support<br>
structure 180 contains an extension that rests on the cheek<br>
area 189 and houses transmitting means 183 for wireless<br>
transmission, processing means 185 and power source 187.<br>
FIG. 16C. is an exemplary preferred embodiment showing<br>
person 100 wearing a two piece structure 180a comprised of<br>
support structure 180b and housing -structure 180c connected<br>
by wires 192, preferably a flexible circuit. Support<br>
structure 180b contains the sensor 182 which is positioned<br>
at the BTT site. Housing structure 180c which can comprise<br>
an adhesive strip on the forehead 21 houses processing<br>
device 183a, transmitting device 183b and power source 187<br>
for transmitting the signal to unit 194, for example a cell<br>
phone.<br>
FIG. 17 is a schematic view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing the support structure 180 with sensor<br>
182 being held at the nose 191 by a clip 19S. Support<br>
structure 180 extends superiorly to the forehead 193.<br>
Housing 195 of support structure 180 contains pressure<br>
attachment means such as clip 196. Housing 197 on the<br><br>
forehead contains the transmitting device and power source.<br>
Clip 196 uses a spring based structure 196a to apply gentle<br>
pressure to secure support structure 180 and sensor 182 in<br>
a stable position. Housing 197 can also have a LCD display<br>
19. The LCD 19 can have an inverted image to be viewed in a<br>
mirror by the user, besides LCD 19 can have a hinge or be<br>
foldable to allow proper positioning to allow the user to<br>
easily view the numerical value displayed.<br>
FIG. 18 is a perspective view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person .10 0 wearing a support structure<br>
180 comprised of a patch with sensor 182 positioned on the<br>
skin at the end of the tunnel and connected by a wire 199<br>
to a decoding and display unit 200. Support structure 180<br>
has a visible indicator 170 lined up with the medial corner<br>
of the eye 174. Wire 199 includes an adhesive tape 201<br>
within its first 20 cm, and most preferably adhesive tape<br>
connected to wire 199 is in the first 10 cm of wire from<br>
sensor 182.<br>
FIGS. 19A1 to 19D are schematic views of preferred<br>
geometry and dimensions of support structures 180 and<br>
sensing device 182. Special geometry and dimension of<br>
sensors and support structure is necessary for the optimal<br>
functioning of the present invention. The dimensions and<br>
design for the support structure 180 are made in order to<br><br>
optimize function and in accordance with the geometry and<br>
dimensions of the different parts of the tunnel.<br>
FIG. 19A1 shows support structure 180 working as a<br>
patch. The patch 180 contains sensor 182. The patch 180<br>
may contain other hardware or solely the sensor 182.<br>
Exemplary sensor 182 is a flat thermistor or surface mount<br>
thermistor. The preferred longest dimension for the patch<br>
referred to as "z" is equal or less than 12 mm, preferably<br>
equal to or less than 8 mm, and most preferably equal to or<br>
 less than 5 mm. The shortest distance from the outer edge<br>
of the sensor 182 to the outer edge of the patch 180 is<br>
referred to as "x" . "x" is equal to or less than 11 mm,<br>
preferably equal to or less than 6 mm and most preferably<br>
equal to or less than 2.5 mm. For illustrative purposes the<br>
sensor 182 has unequal sides, and distance "y" corresponds<br>
to the longest distance from outer edge of the sensor to<br>
outer edge of the patch 180. Despite having unequal sides,<br>
the shortest distance "x" is the determining factor for the<br>
preferred embodiment. It is understood that the whole<br>
surface of the sensor 182 can be covered with an adhesive<br>
and thus there is no distance between the sensor and an<br>
outer edge of a support structure.<br>
An exemplary embodiment for that includes a sensor in<br>
which the surface touching the skin at the BTT site is made<br><br>
with Mylar. The Mylar surface, which comprises the sensor<br>
itself, can have an adhesive in the surface that touches<br>
the skin. In this case, the support structure that can<br>
include a piece of glue or an adhesive, may be constructed<br>
flush in relation to the sensor itself. Accordingly in FIG.<br>
19E support structure 171 comprised of a piece of glue<br>
supports sensor 182 in position against the BTT area.<br>
Sensor 182 can include a Mylar, a thermistor, thermocouple<br>
and the like, and the sensor 182 can be preferably at the<br>
edge of the support structure 171 such as a piece of glue<br>
or any support structure, and said sensor 182 can be<br>
preferably further insulated in its outer surface with a<br>
piece of insulating material 173, such as polyethylene.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19A2, the sensor 182 has adhesive in<br>
its surface, to be secured to skin 11. The sensor then can<br>
be applied to the BTT site in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention. The preferred distance "x"<br>
equal to or less than 2.5 mm allows precise pinpoint<br>
placement of sensor 182 at the main entry site of the<br>
tunnel and thus allows the most optimal signal acquisition,<br>
and it should be used for applications that require<br>
greatest precision of measurements such as during<br>
monitoring surgical procedures. Although a patch was used<br>
as support structure for the description of the preferred<br><br>
dimensions, it is understood that the same dimensions can<br>
be applied to any support structure in accordance with the <br>
principle of the invention including clips, medial can.thal<br>
pads, head mounted gear, and the like.<br>
FIG. 19B is an exemplary embodiment of a round patch<br>
180 with a flat sensor 182. Preferred dimensions "x" and<br>
"z" apply equally as for FIG. 19A1, FIG. 19C is an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a patch 180 with a bead-type sensor<br>
182. Preferred dimensions "x" and "z" apply equally as for<br>
FIG. 19A1. FIG. 19D is an exemplary embodiment of a support<br>
structure 180 with, a sensor-chip 15. Sensor chip 15<br>
comprises a sensor that is integrated as part of a chip,<br>
such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC).<br>
For example sensor chip 15 includes sensor 15a, processor<br>
15b, and transmitter 15c. Preferred dimension "x" apply<br>
equally as for FIG. 19A1. Other hardware such as power<br>
source 2 7 may be housed in the support structure 180 which<br>
can have a long dimension referred to as "d" that does not<br>
affect performance as long as the dimension "x" is<br>
preserved.<br>
The support structure and sensor are adapted to match<br>
the geometry and dimensions of the tunnel, for either<br>
contact measurements or non-contact measurements, in which,<br>
the sensor does not touch the skin at the BTT site.<br><br>
FIGS. 20A to 20C show the preferred dimensions "x" for<br>
any support structure in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The distance from the outer edge 180a of the<br>
support structure to outer edges of sensor 182a is 11 mm,<br>
as shown in FIG. 20A. Preferably, the distance from the<br>
outer edge 180a of support structure to outer edges of<br>
sensor 182a is 6 mm, as shown in FIG. 20B. Most<br>
preferably, the distance from the outer edge 180a of the<br>
support structure to outer edges of sensor 182a is 2.5 mm,<br>
as shown in FIG. 20C.<br>
Preferred positions of sensors 182 in relation to the<br>

TIG. 31A is a top perspective view of one alternative<br>
embodiment of a support structure incorporated as<br>
eyeglasses 380 with holes 364, 365 in regular nose pads<br>

368 connecting transmitter 370 housed inside the right<br>
temple 369 to nose pad 366. Eyeglasses 380 further includes<br>

 390 being secured to the nose pad 392. Medial canthal cap<br>
390 contains sensor 396, transmitter chip 398 and opening<br>
397. FIG. 33B is a perspective view showing the end result<br>
of the medial canthal cap 390 secured to the nose pad 392.<br>
Special nose pads are provided by the present<br>
invention for proper positioning a sensor at the BTT site.<br>
FIG. 34 is a perspective view of a modified left side<br>
rotatable nose pad 400 adapted to position a sensor on the<br>
skin at the end of the tunnel and includes nose pad 402<br>
with sensor 401, arm 404, house 406 which houses a gear<br>
that allows rotation of a nose pad as a dial for<br>
positioning sensor 401 on different regions of the tunnel<br>
identified as 1 and 2. Position 1 places the sensor in line<br>
with the medial canthal corner and reaches the general area<br>
of the main entry point of the tunnel and position 2 places<br><br>
the sensor above the medial canthal corner right at the<br>
main entry point of the tunnel. This embodiment allows<br>
automated activation of the sensing system and takes<br>
advantage of the fact that the nose bridge is cold as seen<br>
in FIG. 1 (nose is dark) and FIG. 2 (nose is purple and<br>
blue). When the pad is in its resting position ("zero"),<br>
the sensor 401 rests in a cold place with temperature of<br>
35.7° C corresponding to the regular position of nose pads<br>
on the nose. In position "zero" the sensor is in Sleep Mode<br>
(temperature of 35.8° C or less) . Changing the sensor to a<br>
hot region such as the general area (position 1) or the<br>
main entry point (position 2) automatically activates the<br>
sensor which goes into Active Mode and start sensing<br>
function.<br>
It is understood that numerous special nose pads and<br>
medial canthal pads can be used in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention including a pivotal hinge that<br>
allows pads to be foldable in total or in part, self-<br>
adjusting pads using a spring, pivoting, sliding in a<br>
groove, and the like as well as self-adjusting mechanisms<br>
which are adaptable to anatomic variations found in<br>
different races. It is understood that the modified nose<br>
pads are preferably positioned high in the frame, most<br><br>
preferably by connecting to the upper part of the lens rim<br>
or within 6 mm from the upper edge of the lens rim.<br>
A variety of materials can be used including materials<br>
with super-adherent properties to allow intimate apposition<br>
of sensing devices to the BTT site. A variety of metallic<br>
wires exhibiting super-elastic properties can be used as<br>
the hinge assembly mechanism for allowing proper<br>
positioning of a sensing device with the BTT site. Medial<br>
canthal pads can be made of a flexible synthetic resin<br>
material such as a silicon rubber, conductive plastic,<br>
conductive elastomeric material, metal, pliable material,<br>
and the like so that appropriate apposition to the BTT site<br>
at the medial canthal area and proper functioning is<br>
achieved. It is also understood that the medial canthal<br>
pads can exhibit elastic and moldable properties and<br>
include material which when stressed is able to remain in<br>
the stressed shape upon removal of the stress. Any type of<br>
rubber, silicone, and the like with shape memory can also<br>
be used in the medial canthal pads and modified nose pad.<br>
By greatly reducing or eliminating the interfering<br>
constituents and providing a high signal to noise ratio<br>
with a sensor adapted to capture thermal radiation from the<br>
BTT, the present invention provides the devices needed for <br>
accurate and precise measurement of biological parameters<br><br>
including chemical components in vivo using optical devices<br>
such as infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, the apparatus and<br>
methods of the present invention by enhancing the signal<br>
allows clinical useful readings to be obtained with various<br>
techniques and using different types of electromagnetic<br>
radiation. Besides near-infrared spectroscopy, the present<br>
invention provides superior results and higher signal to<br>
noise ratio when using other forms of electromagnetic<br>
radiation such as for example mid-infrared radiation, radio<br>
wave impedance, photoacoustic spectroscopy, Raman<br>
spectroscopy, visible spectroscopy, ultraviolet<br>
spectroscopy, fluorescent spectroscopy, scattering<br>
spectroscopy and optical rotation of polarized light as<br>
well as other techniques such as fluorescent (including<br>
Maillard reaction, light induced fluorescence' and induction<br>
of glucose fluorescence by ultraviolet light),<br>
colorimetric, refractive index, light reflection, thermal<br>
gradient, Attenuated Total Internal Reflection, molecular<br>
imprinting, and the like. A sensor adapted to capture<br>
thermal energy at the BTE (Brain Thermal Energy) tunnel<br>
site provides optimal means for measurement of biological<br>
parameters using electromagnetic devices. The BTE tunnel is<br>
the physical equivalent to the physiologic BTT and is used<br>
herein to characterize the physics of the tunnel. The<br><br>
geometry and dimension on the skin surface are the same for<br>
the BTT and BTE tunnel.<br>
The following characteristics of the BTE tunnel allow<br>
optimal signal acquisition. Skin at the end of the BTE<br>
tunnel is thin. With a thick s-kin radiation may fail to<br>
penetrate and reach the substance to be measured. Skin at<br>
the BTE tunnel is homogenous with constant thickness along<br>
its entire surface. Random thickness of skin as occurs in<br>
other skin areas prevent achieving the precision needed.<br>
The BTE tunnel has no fat. The intensity of the reflected<br>
or transmitted signal can vary drastically from patient to<br>
patient depending on the individual physical<br>
characteristics such as the amount of fat. A blood vessel<br>
in the end of the BTE is superficial, terminal and void of<br>
thermoregulatory shunts. In other parts of the skin the<br>
deep blood vessels are located deep and vary greatly in<br>
position and depth from person to person. The BTE tunnel<br>
has no light scattering elements covering its end such as<br>
bone, cartilage and the like. Thermal radiation does not<br>
have to go through cartilage or bone to reach the substance<br>
to be measured. The end of the BTE tunnel on the skin has a<br>
special but fixed geometry and is well demarcated by<br>
permanent anatomic landmarks. In other skin surfaces of the<br>
body, inconsistency in the location of the source and<br><br>
detector can be an important source of error and<br>
variability<br>
Far-infrared radiation spectroscopy measures natural<br>
thermal emissions after said emissions interact and are<br>
absorbed by the substance being measured. The present<br>
invention provides a thermally stable medium, insignificant<br>
number of interfering constituents, and a thin skin is the<br>
only structure to be traversed by the thermal emissions<br>
from the BTE tunnel before- reaching the detector. Thus<br>
there is high accuracy and precision when converting the<br>
thermal energy emitted by the BTE tunnel into concentration<br>
of the substance being measured.<br>
The natural spectral emission by BTE tunnel changes<br>
according to the presence and concentration of chemical<br>
substances. The far-infrared thermal radiation emitted<br>
follow Planck's Law and the predicted amount of thermal<br>
radiation can be calculated. Reference intensity is<br>
calculated by measuring thermal energy absorption outside<br>
the substance of interest band. The thermal energy<br>
absorption in the band of substance of interest can be<br>
determined via spectroscopic means by comparing the<br>
measured and predicted values at the BTE tunnel site. The<br>
signal is then converted to concentration of the substance<br><br>
measured according to the amount of thermal energy<br>
absorbed.<br>
A sensor adapted to view the BTE tunnel provides means<br>
for measuring a substance of interest using natural brain<br>
far-infrared emissions emitted at the BTE tunnel site and<br>
for applying Beer-Lambert's law in-vivo. Spectral radiation<br>
of infrared energy from the surface of the BTE tunnel site<br>
corresponds to spectral information of chemical substances.<br>
These thermal emissions irradiated at 38 degrees Celsius<br>
can include the 4,000 to 14,000 nm wavelength range. For<br>
example, glucose strongly absorbs light around the 9,400 nm<br>
band. When far-infrared thermal radiation is emitted at the<br>
BTE tunnel site, glucose will absorb part of the radiation<br>
corresponding to its band of absorption. Absorption of the<br>
thermal energy by glucose bands is related in a linear<br>
fashion to blood glucose concentration in the thermally<br>
sealed and thermally stable environment present in the BTS<br>
tunnel.<br>
The support structure includes at least one radiation<br>
source from infrared to visible light which interacts with<br>
the substance being measured at the BTE tunnel and a <br>
detector for collecting the resulting radiation.<br>
The present invention provides method for measuring<br>
biological parameters comprising the steps of measuring<br><br>
infrared thermal radiation at the BTE tunnel site,<br>
producing output electrical signals representative of the<br>
intensity of the radiation, converting the resulting input,<br>
and sending the converted input to a processor. The<br>
processor is adapted to provide the necessary analysis of<br>
the signal to determine the concentration of the substance<br>
measured and for displaying the results.<br>
The present invention includes means for directing<br>
preferably near-infrared energy into the surface of the<br>
skin at the end of the BTE tunnel, means for analyzing and<br>
converting the reflectance or back scattered spectrun into<br>
the concentration of the substance measured and support<br>
structure for positioning the light source and detector<br>
device adjacent to the surface of the skin at the BTE<br>
tunnel site.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for<br>
determining the concentration of a substance with said<br>
methods including the steps of directing electromagnetic<br>
radiation such as near-infrared at the skin at the BTE<br>
tunnel site, detecting the near-infrared energy radiated<br>
from said skin at the BTE tunnel site, taking the resulting<br>
spectra and providing an electrical signal upon detection,<br>
processing the signal and reporting concentration of the.<br>
substance of interest according to said signal. The<br><br>
invention also includes device and methods for positioning<br>
the light sources and detectors in stable position and with<br>
stable pressure and temperature in relation to the surface<br>
to which radiation is directed to and received from.<br>
The present invention further includes devices for<br>
directing infrared energy through the nose using medial<br>
canthal pads, devices for positioning radiation source and<br>
detector diametrically opposed to each other, and devices<br>
for analyzing and converting the transmitted resulting<br>
spectrum into the concentration of the substance measured.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for measuring<br>
biological parameters with said methods including the steps<br>
of directing electromagnetic radiation such as near-<br>
infrared through the nose using medial canthal pads,<br>
collecting the near-infrared energy radiated from said<br>
nose, taking the resulting spectra and providing an<br>
electrical signal upon detection, processing the signal and<br>
reporting concentration of the substance measured according<br>
to said signal. The invention also includes means and<br>
methods for positioning the radiation sources and detectors<br>
in a stable position and with stable pressure and<br>
temperature in relation to the surface to which radiation<br>
is directed through.<br><br>
The present invention yet includes devices for<br>
collecting natural far-infrared thermal radiation from the<br>
BTE tunnel, devices for positioning a radiation collector<br>
to receive said radiation, and devices for converting the<br>
collected radiation from the BTE tunnel into the<br>
concentration of the substance measured. The present<br>
invention also provides methods for measuring biological<br>
parameters with said methods including the steps of using<br>
the natural far-infrared thermal emission from the BTE<br>
tunnel as the resulting radiation for measuring the<br>
substance of interest, collecting the resulting radiation<br>
spectra, providing an electrical signal upon detection,<br>
processing the signal and reporting the concentration of<br>
the substance measured according to said signal.<br>
A drug dispensing system including an infusion pump<br>
can be activated according to the level of the substance<br>
measured at the BTE tunnel, for example" insulin can be<br>
injected automatically as needed to normalize glucose<br>
levels as an artificial pancreas.<br>
Any substance present in blood which is capable of<br>
being analyzed by electromagnetic devices can be measured<br>
at the BTE tunnel. For example but not by way of limitation<br>
such substances can include exogenous chemicals such as<br>
drugs and alcohol as well as endogenous chemicals such as<br><br>
 glucose, oxygen, lactic acid, cholesterol, bicarbonate,<br>
hormones, glutamate, urea, fatty acids, triglycerides,<br>
proteins, creatinine, aminoacids and the like. Values such<br>
as pH can also be calculated as pH can be related to light<br>
absorption using reflectance spectroscopy.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 35 a schematic view of one<br>
preferred reflectance measuring apparatus of the present<br>
invention is shown. PIG. 35 shows a light source 420 such<br>
as an infrared LED and a photodetector 422 located side-by<br>
side and disposed within support structure 426 such as a<br>
medial canthal pad or modified nose pads of eyeglasses<br>
directing radiation 424 at the BTE tunnel 430 with said<br>
light source 420 laying in apposition to the skin 428 at<br>
the BTE tunnel 430. The light source 420 delivers the<br>
radiation 424 to the skin 428 at the BTE tunnel which is<br>
partially absorbed according to the interaction with the<br>
substance 432 being measured resulting in attenuated<br>
radiation 425. Part of the radiation 424 is then absorbed<br>
by the substance 432 and the resulting radiation 425<br>
emitted from BTE tunnel 430 is collected by the<br>
photodetector 422 and converted by a processor into the<br>
blood concentration of the substance 432. Thin skin 428 is<br>
the only tissue interposed between radiation 424, 425 and<br>
the substance 432 being measured. The concentration of the<br><br>
substance 432 is accomplished by detecting the magnitude of<br>
light attenuation collected which is caused by the<br>
absorption signature of the substance being measured.<br>
Infrared LEDs (wavelength-specific LEDs) are the<br>
preferred light source for this embodiment because they can<br>
emit light of known intensity and wavelength, are very<br>
small in size, low-cost, and the light can be precisely<br>
delivered to the site. The light source 420 emits<br>
preferably at least one near-infrared wavelength, but<br>
 alternatively a plurality of different wavelengths can be<br>
used. The -light source emits radiation 424, preferably<br>
between 750 and 3000 nm, including a wavelength typical of<br>
the absorption spectrum for the substance 432 being<br>
measured. The preferred photodetector includes a<br>
semiconductor photodiode with a 400 micron diameter<br>
photosensitive area coupled to an amplifier as an<br>
integrated circuit.<br>
FIG. 36 shows a schematic view of a person 100 wearing<br>
a support structure 43 4 and light source 436 and detector<br>
438 adapted to measure biological parameters using spectral<br>
transmission device. The light source 436 and photodetector<br>
438 are positioned diametrically opposed to each other so<br>
that the output of the radiation source 436 goes through<br>
the nasal interface 442 containing the substance 440 being<br><br>
measured before being received by the detector 438.<br>
Photodetector 438 collects the resulting transmitted<br>
radiation which was directed through the nasal interface<br>
442. A variety of LEDs and optical fibers disposed within<br>
the support structure 43 4 such as the medial canthal pads,<br>
nose pads and frames of eyeglasses are preferably used as a<br>
light delivery for the light source 436 and the light<br>
detector 438.<br>
Arms. of support structures 434 such as medial canthal<br>
pads are moveable, and can be adjusted into different<br>
positions for creating a fixed or changeable optical path.<br>
Preferred substances measured include oxygen and glucose.<br>
The brain maintains constant blood flow, whereas flow in<br>
extremities change according to cardiac output and ambient<br>
conditions. The oxygen levels found in the physiologic<br>
tunnel reflects central oxygenation. The oxygen monitoring<br>
in a physiologic tunnel is representative of the general<br>
hemodynamic state of the body. Many critical conditions<br>
such as sepsis (disseminated infection) or heart problems<br>
which alter perfusion in most of the body can be monitored.<br>
Oxygen in the BTE tunnel can continuously monitor perfusion<br>
and detect early hemodynamic changes.<br>
FIG. 37 is a schematic cross-sectional view of another<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention using thermal<br><br>
emission from the BTE tunnel. FIG 37 shows a support<br>
structure 450 housing a thermal infrared detector 444 which<br>
has a. filter 446 and a sensing element 443 with said<br>
sensing element 448 being preferably a thermopile and<br>
responding to thermal infrared radiation 452 naturally<br>
emitted by the BTE tunnel 454. The support structure 450 is<br>
adapted to have sensing device 448 with a field of view<br>
that corresponds to the geometry and dimension of the skin<br>
462 at the end of the BTE tunnel 4S4. Support structure 450<br>
 provides walls 456, 458 which are in contact with the skin<br>
462 with said walls creating a cavity 460 which contains<br>
thermal radiation 453 which has already passed through thin<br>
skin 462.<br>
For example in the thermally sealed and thermally<br>
stable environment in the BTE tunnel 454, at 38° Celsius<br>
spectral radiation 453 emitted as 9,400 nm band is absorbed<br>
by glucose in a linear fashion according to the amount of<br>
the concentration of glucose due to the carbon-oxygen-<br>
carbon bond in the pyrane ring present in the glucose<br>
molecule. The resulting radiation 453 is the thermal<br>
emission 4 52 minus the absorbed radiation by the substance<br>
464. The resulting radiation 453 enters the infrared<br>
detector 444 which generates an electrical signal<br>
corresponding to the spectral characteristic and intensity<br><br>
of said resulting radiation 453. The resulting radiation<br>
453 is then converted into the concentration of the<br>
substance 464 according to the amount of thermal energy<br>
absorbed in relation to the reference intensity absorption<br>
outside the substance 464 band.<br>
The same principles disclosed in the present invention<br>
can be used for near-infrared transmission measurements as<br>
well as for continuous wave tissue oximeters, evaluation of<br>
hematocrit, blood cells and other blood components. The<br>
 substance measured can be endogenous such as glucose or<br>
exogenous such as alcohol and drugs including<br>
photosensitizing drugs.<br>
Numerous support structures can position sensors at<br>
the BTT site for measuring biological parameters.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 38 is a side perspective view of an<br>
alternative embodiment showing a person 100 using head<br>
mounted gear 470 as a support structure positioning with<br>
wires 478 and sensor 476 on the skin at the BTT site. A<br>
microelectronic package 472 containing transmitting means,<br>
processing means, and power source is disposed within or<br>
mounted on head band 470, with said head band 470 providing<br>
wire 478 from microelectronic package 472 for connection<br>
with sensing device 476 on the skin at the BTT site.<br><br>
It is understood that the sensing device can be an<br>
integral part of the support structure or be connected to<br>
any support structures such as using conventional<br>
fasteners including screw, pins, a clip, a tongue-groove<br>
relationship, interlocking pieces, direct attachment,<br>
adhesives, mechanical joining, and. the like; and said<br>
support structures include patches, clips, eyeglasses, head<br>
mounted gear, and the like.<br>
Various means to provide electrical energy to the<br>
sensing system were disclosed. The BTE tunnel offers yet a<br>
new way for natural generation of electrical energy.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 39 is a schematic diagram of a preferred<br>
embodiment for generating thermoelectric energy from the<br>
BTE tunnel to power the sensing system. The generator of<br>
the invention converts heat from the tunnel into<br>
electricity needed to power the system. A thermoelectric<br>
module is integrated into the support structure to power<br>
the sensing system. The thermoelectric module preferably<br>
includes a thermopile or a thermocouple which comprises<br>
dissimilar metallic wires forming a junction. As heat moves<br>
from the tunnel through the thermoelectric module an<br>
electric current is generated. Since the BTE tunnel is<br>
surrounded by cold regions, the Seebeck effect can provide,<br>
means for generating power by inducing electromotive force<br><br>
(emf) in the presence of a temperature gradient due to<br>
distribution of electric charges at the surface, and<br>
interface of the thermoelectric circuit generated by the<br>
temperature at the BTE tunnel.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 39 shows the junctions Tl and T2 of<br>
metallic wire A 470 and metallic wire B 472 kept at<br>
different temperatures by placing junction Tl at the main<br>
entry point of the tunnel and junction T2 in a cold area<br>
such as the nose bridge (denoted in blue or purple in FIG.<br>
1B, and referred herein as blue-purple nose). Metallic<br>
wires A 470 and B 472 are made of different materials and<br>
electric current flows from the hot to the cold region due<br>
to the thermal gradient with a magnitude given by the ratio<br>
of the thermoelectric potential. The potential U is given<br>
by U = (Qa - Q b) * ( T1 - T 2), where Qa and Q b denote the<br>
Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric power) of metal A and<br>
metal B2 and T1 denotes temperature at the entry point of<br>
the BTE tunnel and T 2 denotes temperature at the blue-<br>
purple nose. The thermoelectric potential generated can<br>
power the sensing system and a capacitor 474 inserted into<br>
the system can be used to collect and store the energy and<br>
MCU 476 is adapted to control the delivery of energy as<br>
needed for measuring, processing and transmitting the<br>
signal.<br><br>
It is understood that other means to convert thermal<br>
energy from the BTE tunnel into electricity can be used. It<br>
is also understood that the surface of the eye and caruncle<br>
in the eye can provide a thermal gradient and Seebeck<br>
effect, however it is much less desirable than using the<br>
skin at the end of the BTE tunnel since hardware and wires<br>
touching the surface of the eye and/or coming out of the<br>
eye can be quite uncomfortable and cause infection. It is<br>
yet understood that the cold end can include any relatively<br>
cold article including the frame of the glasses as well as<br>
the air.<br>
Contrary to that numerous support structures disclosed<br>
in the present invention including eyeglasses can easily be<br>
adapted to provide in an unobtrusive manner the power<br>
generating system of the invention, for example by using a<br>
support structure such as eyeglasses for positioning the<br>
hot junction at the BTE site using medial canthal pads and<br>
positioning the cold junction on the nose using regular<br>
nose pads of eyeglasses. It is also understood that<br>
although the power generating system using Brain Thermal<br>
Energy was designed for powering the sensing system of the<br>
 present invention, any other electrical device could be<br>
adapted to be supplied with energy derived from the Braid<br>
Thermal Energy tunnel.<br><br>
Additional embodiments include support structures to<br>
position the sensor at the BTT site of animals. Many useful<br>
applications can be achieved, including enhancing<br>
artificial insemination for mammalian species by detecting<br>
moment of ovulation, monitoring - herd health by' continuous<br>
monitoring of brain temperature, detection of parturition<br>
and the like.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 40 is a perspective view of a<br>
preferred embodiment showing an animal 101 with sensor 480<br>
positioned at the BTT site with wire 482 connecting sensor<br>
480 with a microelectronic, package 484 containing a<br>
transmitting device, a- processing device, and power source<br>
in the eyelid pocket 486 of animal 101. Signal from<br>
microelectronic package 484 is preferably transmitted as<br>
radio waves 489. The signal from the transmitter in package<br>
484 can be conveyed to a GPS collar allowing the<br>
identification of the animal having a 'high temperature<br>
associated with the localization of said animal by GPS<br>
means. Whenever there is an increase in brain temperature<br>
identified by the sensing device 480, the signal. of high<br>
temperature activates ' the GPS collar to provide the<br>
localization of the affected animal. Alternatively the<br>
remote radio station receiving waves 48 9 activate the GPS<br>
system when the abnormal signal is received. In this case,<br><br>
the transmitter in package 484 only sends the signal to the<br>
remote station, but not to the GPS collar.<br>
FIG. 41A is a perspective view of a portable support<br>
structure 490 positioning sensor 492 in contact with the<br>
skin 494 at the BTT site -for measuring biological<br>
parameters. Support structure 490 incorporated as a<br>
thermometer with a contact sensor 492 is held by a second<br>
person 17 for positioning the sensor 492 on the skin 494<br>
and performing the measurement. FIG. 41B is a perspective<br>
view of a portable support structure 496 with walls 500<br>
positioning non-contact sensor 498 such as a thermopile<br>
with a field of view that matches in total or in part the<br>
geometry and dimension of the skin area at the end of the<br>
BTT. Support structure 496 incorporated as an infrared<br>
thermometer is held by a second person 105 for positioning<br>
the sensor 498 and measuring biological parameters.<br>
Although it is understood that pointing an infrared<br>
detector to the BTT site can be used in accordance with the<br>
invention, the temperature measured is not as clinically<br>
useful because of the ambient temperature. Therefore, the<br>
support structure 496 contains walls 500 that create a<br>
confined environment for thermal radiation to reach sensor<br>
498 from the skin over the tunnel. Walls 500 of the support-<br>
structure are adapted to match the geometry of the tunnel<br><br>
and to provide a cavity 499 with the boundaries consisting<br>
of the sensor surface 492 and the skin area 493 viewed by<br>
said sensor 498, in a similar manner as described for FIG.<br>
37.<br>
Now, with reference to FIGs. 42A and 42B, FIG. 42A is<br>
a schematic diagram showing the support structure 496, also<br>
referred to herein as a housing, a window 502 and radiation<br>
sensor 504 contained in the housing 496 and an extension<br>
510 secured to the housing adapted for temperature<br>
measurement at the BTT area. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
extension 510 has walls 500 and is substantially conical in<br>
shape and secured to a. housing 496 adapted to be held by a<br>
hand 105 as shown in FIG. 41B. To measure the temperature,<br>
a user 105 positions the extension 510 adjacent to the BTT<br>
site such that the walls 500 of the extension 510 lie on'<br>
the skin at the BTT area and the radiation sensor 504 views<br>
the BTT area. FIG. 42B is a schematic view showing the<br>
walls 500 of extension 510 creating a cavity 499 wherein<br>
thermal radiation 506 emitted from the skin 508 at the BTT<br>
area 518 is received by the radiation sensor 504. BTT area<br>
506 is surrounded by the thick skin and fat in non-BTT<br>
areas 512. BTT temperature measurements are obtained from<br>
the output of the radiation sensor 504 contained in the<br>
housing 496. Electronics 514 within the housing 496 convert<br><br>
the received radiation to a temperature level which is<br>
displayed on a housing display 516 as illustratively shown<br>
in FIG. 41B.<br>
The radiation sensor 504 views at least a portion of<br>
the BTT surface skin area 508 through an infrared<br>
radiation transparent window 502 and detect infrared<br>
radiation 506 from the BTT skin surface 508. The radiation<br>
sensor 504 is preferably a thermopile, but other radiation<br>
sensors may also be used such as pyroelectric detectors or<br>
any other radiation sensors that detect heat flux from the<br>
surface being evaluated. Exemplary window 502 materials<br>
include silicon and germanium. The sensor 504 is preferably<br>
mounted in an extension 510 which is shaped to match the<br>
dimension and geometry of the BTT area 508. The extension<br>
510 can easily be positioned such that only the skin area<br>
508 at the end of the BTT 518 may be viewed by the<br>
radiation sensor 504 wherein the skin area 508 is at<br>
substantially the same temperature as the brain<br>
temperature. Once in a position for the sensor 504 to view<br>
the BTT skin area 508, a button 522 is pressed to begin a<br>
measurement and the processing 514 within the housing 496<br>
determines the brain temperature and display the value in a<br>
liquid crystal display 516 coupled to a sound device 524<br>
for emitting an audio signal. A disposable cover may be<br><br>
used to cover any part of the apparatus in contact with the<br>
skin.<br>
Although the temperature at the end of the BTT is<br>
substantially equivalent to the brain temperature based on<br>
the temperature of the cavernous- sinus and cerebral blood,<br>
a variety of mathematical calculations and means can be<br>
used to determine the temperature at the BTT area including<br>
arterial heat balance, venous heat balance, and ambient<br>
temperature. It is understood that the BTT detector can<br>
contain a sensor for measuring ambient temperature and"said<br>
measured ambient temperature be used for calculating<br>
temperature of the subject.<br>
The temperature at the BTT area can be used as a<br>
reference for adjusting measurement acquired in other parts<br>
of the body outside the BTT area. The electrical equivalent<br>
of the BTT tunnel is an area of high voltage but low<br>
current, in which the voltage representing the temperature<br>
is virtually equal at the two ends of the tunnel.<br>
The high perfusion in the end of the BTT keeps a high<br>
temperature at the skin at the end of said end of the BTT.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
detecting body temperature including the steps of providing<br>
a temperature detector positioned adjacent to the BTT<br>
during temperature detection and determining the<br><br>
temperature based on the radiation sensed at the BTT area.<br>
It is understood that the detector can remain in one<br>
position or move around the BTT area to identify the<br>
surface with the highest temperature.<br>
A further method of detecting body temperature<br>
includes the steps of scanning a temperature detector<br>
across the BTT area and other areas in the head or in the<br>
contra-lateral BTT area and selecting the highest<br>
temperature, preferably selecting the highest temperature<br>
 by scanning the right and the left BTT areas with the<br>
processor in the BTT detector determining and selecting the<br>
highest temperature.<br>
Another method for identifying the highest temperature<br>
point in the BTT area can be found by scanning a radiation<br>
detector over the BTT area and having a processor adapted<br>
to select the highest reading and indicate that with an<br>
audio signal. The temperature detector 20 provides an<br>
audible beep with each peak reading.<br>
FIG. 43A to 43C are diagrams showing preferred<br>
embodiments for the diameter of the cone extension 510 at<br>
the end of the housing 496 in contact with the skin 508 at <br>
the BTT site 518. It is understood that although any shape<br>
can be used for the extension, the extension takes<br>
preferably the form of a cone with a radiation sensor<br><br>
positioned to view the BTT area. The cup 520 has an outer<br>
diameter at its end which is equal to or less than the BTT<br>
area. In FIG. 43A, for the radiation sensor 504 viewing<br>
the general area of the BTT site 508 the preferred outer<br>
diameter of the end 524 of the cup 520 is equal to or less<br>
than 13 mm. In FIG. 43B for the radiation sensor 504<br>
viewing the general main entry point of the BTT site 508<br>
the preferred outer diameter of the end 524 of the cup is<br>
equal to or less than 8 mm. In FIG. 43C, for the radiation<br>
sensor 504 viewing the main entry point the preferred outer<br>
diameter of the end 524 of the cup 520 is equal to or less<br>
than 5 mm. It is understood that although the preferred<br>
geometry of the radiation sensor and extension is round and<br>
has a substantially conical shape, any other shape of the<br>
radiation senor and/or extension can be used including<br>
oval, square, rectangular, and the like. It is understood<br>
that the diameter and geometry is preferably chosen to<br>
match the geometry of the BTT area. It is also understood<br>
that the dimension of the sensor 504 is adapted to match<br>
the dimension of the cup 520 to the viewing area of the<br>
skin 508.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present<br>
invention, the extension is adapted to fit on top of the<br>
eyelids. The portion of the extension 510 of the housing<br><br>
496 in contact with the skin 508 can also have an inner<br>
concave surface that matches the eyelid contour.<br>
Alternatively, the portion of the conical extension 510 in<br>
contact with the skin 508 can have a convex surface to<br>
match the. medial canthal area - and upper lid above the<br>
medial corner of the eye.<br>
It is also understood that the dimensions for<br>
pediatric use are about two thirds of the dimension for<br>
adult size, or even half or less than half of adult size<br>
especially in small children. Accordingly, the preferred<br>
sizes of the outer diameter of the extension for children<br>
are: for the radiation sensor viewing the general area the<br>
preferred outer diameter of the extension is equal to or<br>
less than 9 mm for viewing the general area of the BTT,<br>
equal to or less than 6 mm for viewing the general main<br>
entry point of the BTT, and equal to or less than 4 mm for<br>
viewing the main entry point of the BTT.<br>
Besides the preferred round shape for the end 524 of<br>
extension 510, FIGs. 44A and 44B shows alternative<br>
geometries and shapes of end 524 extension 510 for non-<br>
contact sensor with said sensor viewing at least a portion<br>
of the BTT area next to the corner 528 of the eye 526. In<br>
FIG. 44A, the outer shape of the end 524 of extension 510<br>
is shown as an oval shape. FIG. 44B shows an elliptical,<br><br>
banana or- half moon shape of end 524 of extension 510 for<br>
viewing the medial canthal area and the upper eye lid area.<br>
FIGs. 45A and 45B shows exemplary geometries and<br>
shapes for a support structure containing a contact sensor<br>
with said sensor positioned on the skin at the BTT area.<br>
FIG. 45 is a schematic frontal view showing a temperature<br>
sensor 530 in the shape of a rod contained in a patch 532<br>
and positioned vertically on the BTT area 534 next to the<br>
corner of the eye 538 and nose 537 with a cord 536<br>
extending from the distal end of the sensor 530. FIG. 45B<br>
is a side view of FIG. 45A showing sensor 530 with cord 536<br>
contained in patch 532 next to the eye 539. A sensor is<br>
placed centrally in the patch, wherein the patch measures<br>
less than 11 mm in diameter.<br>
FIGs. 46A to 46D shows exemplary geometries and shapes<br>
for medial canthal pads or modified nose pads and their<br>
relation to the medial corner of the eye.'FIG. 46A, shows a<br>
frontal view of a modified nose pad 540 containing a sensor<br>
542 located centrally in said nose pad 540 wherein the<br>
sensor 542 is positioned on the skin at the BTT area next<br>
to the corner of the eye 544 and nose 546. FIGS. 46B is a<br>
side view showing the eye 545 and nose 546 and the modified<br>
nose pad 540 with the sensor 542 positioned at the BTT<br>
site. FIG. 46C show a frontal view of a modified nose pad<br><br>
550 having a sensor 552 located in its outer edge and<br>
positioned on the skin area at the BTT site next to the<br>
corner of the eye 554 and nose 556. FIG. 46D is a side view<br>
showing the eye 555 and nose 556 and the modified nose pad<br>
550 with the sensor 552 positioned at the BTT site.<br>
It is understood that although an extension is the<br>
preferred embodiment with the sensor not contacting the<br>
skin, an infrared sensor probe adapted to touch the skin at<br>
the BTT area can also be used.<br>
Now in reference to the thermal imaging systems of the<br>
present invention, FIG. 47 is a schematic block diagram<br>
showing a preferred embodiment of the infrared imaging<br>
system of the present invention. FIG. 47 shows a BTT<br>
ThermoScan 560 comprising a camera 562, a microprocessor.<br>
564, a display 566, and a power source 568. The system<br>
further includes proprietary software and software<br>
customized for the precise measurement and mapping of the<br>
BTT area. The BTT ThermoScan 560 includes a camera 562 with<br>
a lens 574, an optical system 572 that can contain mirrors,<br>
filters and lenses for optimizing image acquisition, and a<br>
photodetector 570, also referred to herein as a radiation<br>
sensor or a radiation detector, to quantify and record the<br>
energy flux in the far infrared range. The display unit 566<br>
displays the thermal image of the BTT being viewed by the<br><br>
lens 574 in the camera. Radiation detector materials known<br>
in the art can be used in the photodetector 570 including<br>
alloys of indium-antimonide, mercury-cadmiun-telluride,<br>
Copper doped Germanium, Platinum Silicide, Barium Strontium<br>
Titanate, and the like.<br>
The infrared radiation detector converts the incident<br>
radiation that includes the BTT area into electrical energy<br>
which is amplified. The detector 570 is responsive to<br>
infrared radiation to provide an output signal and discrete<br>
points related to the intensity of the thermal energy<br>
received from the BTT area and the surrounding area around<br>
the BTT area.<br>
The discrete points are imaged and each point source<br>
must have enough energy to excite the radiation detector<br>
material to release electrons. Any point size can be used,<br>
but preferably with a size between 1 and 2 mm in diameter.<br>
When using an angle of 1.3 mrads, the BTT ThermoScan can<br>
capture an instantaneous image from a point size of<br>
approximately 1 mm diameter at a distance of 1 m from the<br>
detector. It is understood that any spatial resolution for<br>
optimal capturing of the BTT image can be used, but it is<br>
preferably between 1.0 and 1.6 mrad. The camera 562 of the<br>
BTT ThermoScan 560 has a field of view adapted to view the<br>
BTT area. Discrete points are further converted into an<br><br>
image of the face that includes the BTT area in the medial<br>
corner of the eye and upper eyelid. The screening function<br>
of the BTT ThermoScan is based on the temperature at the<br>
BTT area, either absolute temperature or the differential<br>
temperature of the BTT area in relation to a reference.<br>
The electrical response to the thermal radiation can<br>
be displayed on the monitor as intensity, with a strong<br>
signal producing a bright (white) point as seen in FIG. 1A<br>
with said, white point being representative of the highest<br>
radiant energy from the source. In FIG. 1A the source is<br>
the human face and the highest intensity of radiation is<br>
found in the BTT area. Calibration of the display screen<br>
result in a continuum shades of gray, from black (0<br>
isotherm) to bright white (1 isotherm). Each point is<br>
digitally stored for further processing and analysis.<br>
It is understood that a variety of lenses, prisms,<br>
filters, Fresnel lenses, and the like known in the art can<br>
be used to change the angle of view or optimize signal<br>
acquisition and capture of thermal energy flux from the<br>
face and the BTT area. The lens of the BTT ThermoScan 560<br>
is preferably perpendicular to the plane of the human face<br>
or of the BTT area being viewed.<br>
The radiation detector material in the BTT ThermoScan<br>
560 is preferably sensitive to radiation with wavelength<br><br>
ranging from 8 to 12 µm. The BTT ThermoScan 560 has a<br>
temperature span set between 2 to 5 degrees Celsius and is<br>
extremely sensitive and adapted to discern temperatures to<br>
within 0.008 degrees Celsius to 0.02 at a range of 1 meter.<br>
Temperature measurements can be -based on radiometric means<br>
with built-in electronics or by differential using a<br>
reference such as a black body. Although the system can be<br>
uncooled, to maximize the efficiency of the detector and<br>
achieve an optimum signal to noise ratio the detector can<br>
be cooled using solid state means, liquid nitrogen,<br>
evaporation of compressed argon gas, piezoelectric<br>
components, and the like.<br>
Many radiation detectors capable of detecting infrared<br>
waves are being developed including silicon based, solid<br>
state systems, and microbolometers, and all said systems<br>
new or to be developed in the future can be used in the<br>
apparatus of the present invention to detect thermal<br>
radiation from the BTT with the display of a corresponding<br>
image of the BTT in a monitor.<br>
An exemplary infrared detector system includes a<br>
microbolometer which is fabricated on silicon substrates or<br>
integrated circuits containing temperature sensitive<br>
resistive material that absorbs infrared radiation, such as<br>
vanadium oxide. The incident infrared radiation from the<br><br>
BTT area is absorbed by the microbolometer producing a<br>
corresponding change in the resistance and temperature.<br>
Each microbolometer functions as a pixel and the changes in<br>
electrical resistance generate an electrical signal<br>
corresponding to thermal radiation from the BTT area that<br>
can be displayed in a screen of a computer.<br>
The display of the image of the BTT is the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, but the present invention can<br>
be implemented without display of an image. Radiation<br>
coming from the BTT can be acquired by the radiation<br>
sensors aforementioned and the temperature of the BTT area<br>
can be calculated based on the electrical signal generated<br>
by the radiation sensor using a reference. Any means to<br>
detect thermal radiation and/or temperature from the BTT<br>
area can be used in accordance with the principles of the<br>
invention.<br>
Besides the. easy manipulation of temperature at the<br>
skin level outside the BTT area, significantly lower<br>
temperatures are found in the areas outside the BTT as<br>
shown in the image on the screen, and depicted in the<br>
photos of FIG. 1A and 1B. The lower and more unstable<br>
temperature outside the BTT area results in generating a<br>
non-clinically significant temperature level or thermal<br><br>
image when said areas outside the BTT are used for sensing<br>
thermal radiation and/or measuring temperature.<br>
It is understood that a variety of signal conditioning<br>
and processing can be used to match the temperature areas<br>
outside the BTT area to a value that corresponds to the BTT<br>
area, and those methods also fall in the scope of the<br>
invention. Image outside the BTT area as seen more like a<br>
blur compared to the BTT area and superimposition of images<br>
that include the BTT area can also be used for achieving<br>
'higher level of accuracy during temperature measurements.<br>
Comparing a radiation pattern outside the BTT area with the<br>
BTT area without necessarily creating an image of the BTT<br>
area can also be used for accurate and precise temperature<br>
measurement and evaluation of the thermal status of the<br>
body in accordance with the principles of the invention.<br>
 Any method or device used for temperature evaluation or<br>
evaluation of the thermal status that is based on the<br>
temperature level or thermal radiation present in the BTT<br>
area by generating or not generating an image falls within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 48 is a schematic view showing the thermal<br>
imaging system 560 of the present invention adapted to be<br>
used in an airport 580 including an infrared camera 582, a<br>
processor 584, and a display 586 which are mounted in a<br><br>
support structure 588 at an airport 580. Camera 582 scans<br>
the BTT area present in the medial corner of the eye 590 in<br>
a human face 591 and provides an output signal to a signal<br>
processor 584. The output signal is an electronic signal<br>
which is related to the characteristic of the thermal<br>
infrared energy of the BTT 590 in the human face 591 when<br>
people 592, 593 walking by look at or are viewed by the<br>
camera 582. The processor 584 processes the output signal<br>
so that an image of the BTT area 594 can be formed by the <br>
display 586 such as a computer monitor.<br>
Exemplarily, passenger 592 is looking at the camera<br>
582 for sensing the thermal radiation from the BTT area<br>
590, with said passenger 582 holding his/her eyeglasses<br>
since for the camera 582 to precisely view the BTT area 590<br>
the eyeglasses have to be removed. If someone goes by the<br>
camera 5 82 without a thermal image of the BTT 5 90 being<br>
acquired an alarm will be activated. Likewise, if someone<br>
has a temperature disturbance an alert indicative of said<br>
temperature disturbance is activated.<br>
FIG. 4 9 is a schematic view showing the thermal<br>
imaging system 560 of the present invention adapted to be<br>
used in any facility that has a gathering of people such as<br>
a movie theater, a convention, stadium, a concert, a trade<br>
show, schools, and the like. In FIG. 49 the infrared camera<br><br>
596 of the BTT Thermoscan 560 is located at the entrance of<br>
the aforementioned facilities and while people 598 show<br>
their identification or ticket to an agent 602 , the BTT<br>
ThermoScan 560 scans the side of the face of the people 598<br>
to capture a thermal image 60 0 and temperature at the BTT<br>
tunnel which is displayed in a remote computer display 604.<br>
The camera 596 has adjustable height and a tracking system<br>
to track the heat, and therefore said camera 596 can<br>
position itself for sensing thermal radiation from people<br>
598 at different distances and of different height. It is<br>
also understood that the BTT Thermoscan 560 can be used in<br>
any facility including optical stores for adjusting<br>
positioning of sensors in eyeglasses.<br>
A facility that is of strategic importance such as a<br>
government building, military bases, courts, certain<br>
factories and the like can also benefit from screening for<br>
temperature disturbances. As shown in FIG. 50, a guard 606<br>
is standing by an infrared detector camera 608 for sensing<br>
thermal radiation from the BTT area and preferably<br>
including a card slot 610 in its housing 612. Although a<br>
guard 606 is shown, the BTT ThermoScan of the present<br>
invention can work in an unguarded entrance. In this<br>
embodiment the BTT thermal image 560 works as a key to<br>
automatically open a door 614. Accordingly, employee 616<br><br>
scan her Company Identification card in the slot 610 which<br>
then prompts the user to look at the camera 608 for<br>
capturing the thermal image of the BTT area. If the<br>
temperature of the BTT is within acceptable limits, the<br>
processor of the ThermoScan 608 is adapted to open the door<br>
614. If the BTT temperature shows fever indicating a<br>
possible infection the employee is directed to a nurse.<br>
This will greatly help safety procedures in facilities<br>
dealing with food products in which one employee having a<br>
contagious disease can contaminate the whole lot of food<br>
products.<br>
FIG. 51 is a schematic view of another embodiment of<br>
the present invention to monitor temperature disturbances<br>
during physical' activity such as sports events, military<br>
training, and the like, showing infrared thermal detector<br>
620 sensing thermal radiation 622 from an athlete 624. The<br>
infrared thermal detector 620 includes a detector head 626<br>
which contains an infrared sensor 628, a digital camera,<br>
630 and a set of lights, red 632, yellow 634 and green 636<br>
indicating the thermal status of the athlete with the red<br>
light 632 indicating temperature that can reduce safety or<br>
performance of the athlete, a red light 632 flashing that<br>
indicates temperature outside safe levels, a yellow light<br>
634 indicating borderline temperature, a green light 636<br><br>
indicating safe temperature levels, and a green light 636<br>
flashing indicating optimum thermal status for enhancing<br>
performance. The infrared sensor 628 detects the thermal<br>
radiation 622 and if the red light 632 is activated the<br>
digital camera 626 takes a picture of the scene to identify<br>
the number of the athlete at risk, for heatstroke or heat<br>
illness. The infrared detector 620 further includes a<br>
processor 638 to process and a transmitter 640 to transmit<br>
the signal wired or wirelessly. It is understood that a<br>
wider field of view can be implemented with multiple BTT<br>
signals being acquired simultaneously as shown by BTT<br>
radiation from a second athlete 642 being sensed by the<br>
infrared detector head 626.<br>
Now referring to FIG. 52A, the BTT ThermoScan of this<br>
embodiment preferably includes a micro solid state infrared<br>
detector 650 which is mounted on. a visor 652 of a vehicle<br>
654 for sensing thermal radiation from the BTT of a driver<br>
656 and of ambient radiation monitored by processor 658<br>
mounted in the dashboard of the vehicle to determine<br>
whether the driver 656 is at risk of temperature<br>
disturbance (hyperthermia or hypothermia) which hampers<br>
mental and physical function and can lead to accidents. In<br>
addition the temperature at the BTT site of the driver 656<br>
can be used for automated climate control and seat<br><br>
temperature control of vehicle 654. When the image of the<br>
BTT site indicates high body temperature the air<br>
conditioner is automatically activated.<br>
FIG. 52B is a representation of an image generated by<br>
the detector 650 showing the BTT area 660 on a display 662.<br>
FIG. 48 is a representation of an illustrative image<br>
generated with the infrared imaging system of the present<br>
invention. FIG. 52B shows a frontal view of the human face<br>
and the BTT area 660 displayed on a screen 662 as well as<br>
the other areas outside the BTT area present in the human<br>
face such as forehead 664, nose 666, and cheeks 668. Please<br>
note that FIG. 1B shows an actual photo of the geometry of<br>
the general entry point of the BTT displayed on a screen<br>
and FIG. 4A shows a side view of the human face and of the<br>
BTT area displayed on a screen.<br>
 FIG. 53 shows an illustrative method of the present<br>
invention represented in a flowchart. It is to be<br>
understood that the method may be accomplished using<br>
various signal processing and conditioning with various<br>
hardware, firmware, and software configurations, so the<br>
steps described herein are by way of illustration only, and<br>
not to limit the scope of the invention. The preferred<br>
embodiment includes detecting thermal radiation from a<br>
source that includes at least a portion of the BTT area<br><br>
(step 670) . At step 672 an image from a radiation source<br>
that includes at least a portion of the BTT area is<br>
generated. At step 674 the image generated at step 672 is<br>
displayed. Step 676 identifies temperature levels from the<br>
image displayed at step 674. Step 678 determines whether<br>
the temperature identified at step 676 matches a<br>
temperature target. The temperature target can be<br>
indicative of a temperature disturbance or indicative of<br>
the need to change the climate control level of the<br>
 vehicle. Considering a temperature disturbance, if yes and<br>
there is a match between the detected temperature at the<br>
BTT and the stored target temperature, then an alarm is<br>
activated at step 680 informing the subject of the<br>
temperature disturbance (e.g., fever, hyperthermia, and<br>
hypothermia) and processing continues at step 670. If<br>
there is. no match, step 678 proceeds to the next operation<br>
at step 670.<br>
To enhance the image generated by the BTT ThermoScan,<br>
the method further includes aligning the BTT area with the<br>
field of view of the infrared detector and by removing<br>
eyeglasses during thermal detection of the BTT area.<br>
FIG. 54A is a perspective view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person 100 wearing a support structure<br>
680 comprised of a patch with sensor 682 positioned on the<br><br>
skin at the end of the tunnel and connected by a wire 684<br>
to a helmet 68 6 which contains the decoding and processing<br>
hardware 688, transmitter 702 and display unit 704.<br>
Exemplary helmets include ones known in the art for the<br>
practice of sports, military, firefighters, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 54B the support structure<br>
includes eyewear 700 with a warning light 702 and sensor<br>
710 of eyewear 700 connected by wire 704 to the head<br>
mounted gear, such as a helmet 706. Sensor 710 has an arm<br>
708 with, a spring mechanism 709 for positioning and<br>
pressing the sensor 710 against the skin at the BTT area.<br>
Now in reference to FIG 55, the temperature sensor 710<br>
can be mounted on nose pieces 712 of masks 714, for example<br>
a mask for firefighters. Wire 716 from mask 714 is mounted<br>
in an insulated manner, such as being positioned within the<br>
structure of mask 714 and air tube 718 that connects mask<br>
714 to air pack 722. Wire 716 connects sensor 710 to radio<br>
transmitter 720 located in the air pack 722. Alternatively,<br>
wire 716 can be mounted external to the air tube 718. A<br>
warning light 724 in the mask 714 alerts the firefighter<br>
about high or low temperature.<br>
FIG. 56A is a diagram showing a BTT entry point<br>
detection system, which corresponds to the area with the<br>
highest temperature in the surface of the body, including<br><br>
temperature sensor 730, amplifier 732, processor 734, and<br>
pager 736. Processor 734 is adapted to drive the pager 736<br>
to emit a high frequency tone for a high temperature and a<br>
low frequency tone for a low temperature. Scanning of the<br>
BTT area with the sensor 730 allows precise localization of<br>
the main entry point of the BTT, which corresponds to the<br>
highest frequency tone generated during the scanning.<br>
Another preferred embodiment for detection of the main<br>
entry point of the BTT includes replacing a buzzer or pager<br>
 emitting sound or vibration by a light warning system.<br>
Exemplarily, FIG. 56B shows a pen 740, a LED 738 mounted on<br>
a board 746 and a LED 739 mounted on said pen 740, a sensor<br>
750, and a processor 742. Wire 744 connects the pen 740 to<br>
board 746. The processor 742 is adapted to activate light<br>
738, 739, when during scanning the BTT area, the highest<br>
temperature is found. By way of example, as shown in FIG.<br>
56B, this pen 740 can be mounted on a board 746 next to a<br>
shelf 748 where TempAlert thermometers 752 are sold,<br>
allowing a customer to precisely locate the main entry<br>
point of the BTT. Sensor 750 of pen 740 can be for example<br>
a non-contact sensor (e.g., Thermopile) or a contact sensor<br>
(e.g., Thermistor).<br>
The detection of the main entry point of the BTT can<br>
also be done automatically. Accordingly, FIG. 57 shows a 4<br><br>
by 4 sensor array 760 placed at Che BTT. The sensor array<br>
760 contains 16 temperature sensors, which measure the<br>
temperature at the BTT site. Each temperature sensor Tl to<br>
T16 in the array 760 provides a temperature output. Sensor<br>
array 760 is connected to microprocessor 754 which is<br>
adapted to identify the sensor in sensor array 760 with the<br>
highest temperature output, which corresponds to the main<br>
entry point of the tunnel. For example temperature sensor<br>
T6 761 is identified as providing the highest temperature<br>
 output, then the temperature of sensor T6 is displayed. The<br>
processor 754 continually searches for the highest<br>
temperature output of sensor array 760 in an automated<br>
manner and the highest temperature is continuously<br>
displayed.<br>
FIG. 58A is an alternative embodiment showing support<br>
structure 758 comprised of a piece of silicone molded to<br>
fit the BTT area with said support structure 758 containing<br>
wire 769 and sensor 770 in its structure. FIG. 58B shows<br>
the support structure 758 with sensor 770 positioned at the<br>
BTT area 775 with wire 769 exiting the molded piece of<br>
silicone structure 758 toward the forehead 773. Now<br>
referring to FIG. 58C, support structure 758 can<br>
alternatively include a multilayer structure comprised of a<br>
Mylar surface 762, sensor 770 with wire 769, and silicone<br><br>
piece 774 in the shape of a cup Chat encapsulates sensor<br>
770, allowing proper and stable positioning of sensor 770<br>
at the BTT area.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide<br>
methods and devices for treating and/or preventing<br>
temperature disturbances. As shown in FIG. 2B the brain is<br>
completely insulated on all sides with the exception at the<br>
entrance of the BTT. The BTT is a thermal energy tunnel in<br>
which thermal energy can flow in a bidirectional manner and<br>
therefore heat can be removed from the brain or delivered<br>
to the brain by externally placing a device at the entrance<br>
of the BTT that either delivers heat or removes heat.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 59 shows the bidirectional flow of<br>
thermal energy represented by arrows 780 carrying heat to<br>
the brain and arrow 782 removing heat from the brain with<br>
the distribution of heat to and from the brain 784<br>
occurring via the thermal storage area 786, with said<br>
thermal storage area shown in FIG. 2B in the center of the<br>
brain. From the thermal storage area 786 the thermal energy<br>
represented as hot or cold blood is distributed throughout<br>
the brain tissue 784 by the blood vessels 788, for treating<br>
and/or preventing hyperthermia (heatstroke) or hypothermia.<br>
Accordingly, another object of this invention is to<br>
provide a new and novel BTT thermal pad for the application<br><br>
of cold or heat to the BTT area for cooling or heating the<br>
brain.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a new<br>
and novel BTT thermal pad which covers the entrance of the<br>
BTT area, which may extend to other areas of the face.<br>
However, since the brain is insulated on all other sides<br>
but at the BTT entrance, the cooling is only external and<br>
does not reach the brain, which could be at "frying"<br>
temperature despite the external cooling sensation.<br>
Considering that, a preferred embodiment includes an<br>
extended BTT thermal pad covering the face in which only<br>
the BTT area is exposed to the cold and the remainder of<br>
the extended BTT thermal pad covering the face is<br>
insulated, preventing the warming up of the gel or ice<br>
placed inside the bag. The BTT thermal pad container can<br>
include a radiant heat-reflecting film over various<br>
portions thereof, and an insulator over the same or other<br>
portions and which together facilitate directional cooling.<br>
Thus, only heat conducted by the BTT is absorbed as the BTT<br>
is cooled.<br>
The BTT thermal device applied to the BTT area<br>
promotes selective brain cooling or selective brain heating<br>
for treating hyperthermia and hypothermia respectively. The<br>
brain, which is the most sensitive organ to thermally<br><br>
induced damage, can be protected by applying heat via the<br>
BTT during hypothermia or removing heat during<br>
hyperthermia. The cooling or heating is selective 9ince the<br>
temperature of the remaining body may not need to be<br>
changed, this is particularly important when cooling the<br>
brain for treating patients with stroke or any brain<br>
damage. The majority of the brain tissue is water and the<br>
removal or application of heat necessary to cool or heat<br>
the brain can be precisely calculated using well known<br>
formulas based on BTU (British thermal unit) . A BTU is the<br>
amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a pound<br>
of water 1 degree F, when a pound of water cools 1 F, it<br>
releases 1 BTU.<br>
The BTT thermal pad for therapeutic treatment of<br>
excessive heat or excessive cold in the brain preferably<br>
includes a bag having a substantially comma, banana, or<br>
boomerang shape, with said bag in complete overlying<br>
relationship with the entire entrance of the BTT, said bag<br>
including an outer wall and an inner wall defining a sealed<br>
cavity to be filled with ice, gel-like material, solid<br>
material, and the like, for cooling or heating the BTT skin<br>
area overlying the entrance of the BTT.<br>
An exemplary brain cooling or brain heating device<br>
includes hot and cold pad or pack adapted to fit and match<br><br>
the special geometry of the entrance of the BTT and<br>
comprising a preferably flexible and sealed pad and a gel<br>
within said pad, said gel being comprised of a mixture of<br>
water, a freezing point depressant selected from the group<br>
consisting of propylene glycol, glycerine, and mixtures<br>
thereof associated with other compounds such as sodium<br>
polyacrylate, benzoate of soda, hydroxibenzoate, and<br>
mixtures thereof and a thickening agent. Any other cooling<br>
or heating device or chemical compounds and gels including<br>
a combination of ammonium nitrate and water can be used as<br>
cooling agent as well as heating agents such as a<br>
combination of iron powder, water, activated carbon,<br>
vermiculite, salt and Purge natural mineral powder. Those<br>
compounds are commercially available from many vendors<br>
(e.g., trade name ACE from Becton-Dickson).<br>
FIG. 60A shows a diagrammatic view of a preferred dual<br>
BTT thermal pad also referred to herein as BTT cold/hot<br>
pack 790 located next to eye 798, 802 including a dual bag<br>
system 792, 794 for both the right and left sides connected<br>
by connector 796. FIG. 60B shows in more detail a<br>
perspective view of the single bag BTT cold/hot pack device<br>
810, represented by a device to be applied to the left-<br>
side, comprising preferably a generally comma-shape,<br>
boomerang-shape or banana-shape pad which is sealed in a<br><br>
conventional fashion at its ends 812 to enclose a quantity<br>
of a gel-like material 800 which fills the pad 814<br>
sufficiently to enable said pad 814 to be closely conformed<br>
to the special topography of the BTT area in the recess<br>
between the eye and nose. FIG. 60C is an opposite<br>
perspective view showing an extension 816 that conforms to<br>
the recess at the BTT area of pad 814 containing gel 800.<br>
The device is referred to herein as BTT cold/hot pad or BTT<br>
cold/hot pack. Still in reference to FIG. 60C, perspective<br>
view is shown of the BTT cold/heat pack device and which is<br>
shown as being formed in a pillow-like configuration which<br>
permits the molding of the BTT cold/heat pack into the BTT<br>
area.<br>
In use the BTT thermal pad would be put into a freezer<br>
or other chilling device for use as a cold compress or<br>
would be put into hot water to be used as a hot compress.<br>
The BTT thermal pad preferably comprises a tough flexible<br>
envelope of plastic material. The material within the BTT<br>
thermal pad is preferably a gel which will maintain its<br>
gel-like consistency over a wide range of temperatures.<br>
There exist many gels which can be cooled to freezing and<br>
which absorb heat during warmup. There are a number of<br>
different types of such gels. Some of them freeze solid,<br>
and some are flexible even at 0 degrees F. Cold packs such<br><br>
as a frozen water-alcohol mixture can also be used.<br>
Alternatively, a BTT thermal pad includes a bag having<br>
inner and outer walls lined interiorly with plastic which<br>
define a cavity to be filled with ice through an opening in<br>
the bag. In this instance the bag is preferably sealed with<br>
a rubber material.<br>
Although flexible plastic is described as a preferred<br>
material for containing the gel, it is understood that any<br>
material or fabric can be used including vinyl, cotton,<br>
rayon, rubber, thermoplastic, synthetic polymers, mixtures<br>
of materials, and the like. The size and shape of the BTT<br>
pad structure is adapted to fit the special anatomy of the<br>
recess between eye and nose and for matching the special<br>
geometry of the entrance of the BTT.<br>
Any cooling or heating device known in the art can be<br>
used in the BTT pad treatment device including hot or cold<br>
water flowing through tubes that are adapted to carry or<br>
deliver heat to the BTT area. The tubes can be mounted in<br>
any head gear or the frame of eyeglasses, pumping<br>
mechanisms can be mounted in the head gear or eyeglasses<br>
for providing a continuous flow of water through the tubes.<br>
The BTT pad can be connected to tubes which have connectors<br>
for joining to a water temperature control and circulating<br>
unit in the head gear or eyeglasses. Hot or cold liquid is<br><br>
circulated through tubes which are in communication with<br>
each other and which deliver or remove heat from the BTT.<br>
Elastic band or hook and loop fastener can be used for<br>
securing the BTT pad in position. Any of the support<br>
structures mentioned herein can -be used to secure the BTT<br>
pad in position including a piece of glue. For example, the<br>
BTT pad can include a clip like mechanism or the BTT<br>
thermal pad can be secured to the frame of eyeglasses. Nose<br>
pads of eyeglasses or modified nose pads of eyeglasses can<br>
include cooling or heating devices for delivering or<br>
removing heat from the BTT. A BTT thermal pad can include<br>
a stick mounted in the pad that can held by hand and<br>
manually placed in the BTT area, for example held by a<br>
player during a break in the game to reduce the temperature<br>
in the brain, or for warming up the brain of a skier during<br>
a winter competition.<br>
An alternative embodiment includes a BTT thermal pad<br>
attached to a head gear for supplying water to<br>
evaporatively cool the BTT area. In this instance the cold<br>
water is generated by evaporative cooling in the headband<br>
and forehead and upper portion of a wearer's head.<br>
Any cooling or heating device can be used to cool or<br>
heat the BTT area for selective brain cooling or brain<br>
heating, preferably using a moldable device that conforms<br><br>
to the anatomy of the region at the entrance of the BTT,<br>
with directional temperature control properties for cooling<br>
or heating the skin at the entrance of the BTT. Any of the<br>
devices for heating or overheating or for cooling,<br>
including electrical, chips, semiconductor, polymers, and<br>
the like known in the art as well as described by Abreu in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,120,460; No. No. 6,312,393 and 6,544,193,<br>
herein incorporated in their entirety by reference, and<br>
other pending applications by Abreu can be adapted in<br>
support structures for positioning at the BTT entrance and<br>
used for cooling or heating the brain.<br>
The present invention provides a moldable BTT thermal<br>
pad or BTT thermal pack in a packaging arrangement that can<br>
provide surfaces of differing thermal conductivities and<br>
heat reflecting properties so as to prolong the useful<br>
cooling/heating time thereof. The construction and<br>
materials of the BTT thermal pad or BTT thermal pack<br>
permits the molding of its shape and the retention thereof<br>
to the BTT site on the skin between the eye and nose. The<br>
materials disclosed herein can remain flexible plastic for<br>
temperatures in the range of -10° C. to 140° C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 61, a frontal view of an alternative<br>
embodiment of BTT thermal pack 820 is shown including a bag<br>
822 with gel 800 with said bag having two parts with the<br><br>
first part 824 positioned at the main portion of BTT 824<br>
and containing the highest amount of gel 800 and a second<br>
part 826 positioned at the peripheral portion of the BTT<br>
and containing a smaller amount of gel.<br>
FIG. 62 shows a cross sectional view of the bag 828 of<br>
the BTT thermal pack containing gel 800 with said bag<br>
sealed in its ends 832, 834.<br>
It is understood that a ring shape surrounding the eye<br>
can also be used or a shape that includes other parts of<br>
 the face/forehead as long as there is conformation and<br>
apposition of part of the BTT thermal pack to the BTT area.<br>
The preferred shape and dimension matches the special<br>
geometry of the BTT area described herein.<br>
FIG. 63A shows a preferred embodiment of the BTT<br>
thermal pack 830 in its relaxed state that includes a hard<br>
upper part 836 made preferably of hard rubber or plastic<br>
attached to a bag 838 made of soft plastic with said bag<br>
containing gel 800 and being deformable upon external<br>
pressure. As depicted in FIG. 63B, the BTT thermal pack 830<br>
is shown with a centrally formed convex shape 842 at the<br>
opposite end of hard upper part 836 upon compression shown<br>
by arrows 844 to conform to the BTT anatomy 840 between eye<br>
852 and nose 854 of person 100.<br><br>
The BTT thermal pack is preferably moldable and the<br>
container or bag constructed with materials that are<br>
deformable and otherwise pliable over the temperature range<br>
of use so as to conform to the anatomy of the BTT area. A<br>
central convex area in the pack allows for intimate<br>
interaction and thermal energy transfer at the entrance of<br>
the BTT, but it is to be recognized that the specific shape<br>
of the convex area of the BTT cold/heat pack itself can be<br>
slightly varied according to the ethnic group.<br>
FIG.64A shows a side cross- sectional view of a head<br>
856 of person 100 with BTT thermal pack 850 in a pillow-<br>
like configuration located at the BTT site 858.<br>
Construction of BTT thermal pack is performed so as to<br>
maintain an intimate apposition to the BTT site. FIG. 64B<br>
is a frontal view of BTT hot/cold pack 850 shown in FIG.<br>
64A at the BTT site 858 located next to the left eye 862.<br>
FIG. 65 shows a perspective view of a BTT thermal pack<br>
860 that includes a bag 864 containing gel 800 and a rod<br>
866 for manually holding said BTT pack 860 at the BTT site.<br>
FIG. 66 shows a frontal view of a dual bag BTT thermal pack<br>
870 with bags 872, 874 connected to a rod 880 by flexible<br>
wires 876, 878.<br>
FIG. 67A shows a BTT thermal mask 880 with openings<br>
884 for the eyes and 886 for the nose and comprised of a<br><br>
pouch containing gel 800, and including bags 888, 890 for<br>
matching the anatomy of the BTT area. The remainder of the<br>
mask 880 comprises flat area 892. The flat area 892 is<br>
preferably insulated for allowing directional thermal<br>
energy flow, so the gel 800 only touches the skin at the<br>
BTT area. FIG. 67B is a cross-sectional side view of mask<br>
880 showing pouch 894 with bags 888, 890 and the remaining<br>
flat area 892.<br>
FIG.67C is a schematic view of BTT thermal mask 898<br>
with pouches 895, 896 which allow intimate apposition to<br>
the BTT area being worn by user 897.<br>
FIG. 68A is a perspective view showing the BTT thermal<br>
pack 900 being applied to the BTT area by support structure<br>
comprised of eyewear 902 being worn by user 903. FIG. 68B<br>
is a perspective frontal view of a BTT hot/cold pack 930<br>
with dual bags 93 2, 934 for right and left BTT and<br>
connected by an arm 936 working as a clip to secure a<br>
hot/cold pack in place on the BTT of user 938.<br>
The brain cooling or brain heating device in<br>
accordance with the principles of the invention includes<br>
hot and cold pad or pack adapted to fit and match the<br>
special geometry of the entrance of the BTT and comprising<br>
a preferably flexible and sealed pad and a gel within said<br>
pad, with the surface touching the skin having a<br><br>
substantially convex shape. Accordingly, FIG. 69A is a<br>
perspective side view of BTT thermal pack 910 and bulging<br>
substantially convex part 906 which rests against the skin<br>
and conforms to the anatomy of the BTT. FIG. 6 9B is a<br>
perspective inferior view of BTT hot/cold pack 910 and<br>
bulging substantially convex part 906 which rests against<br>
the skin and conforms to the anatomy of the BTT. FIG. 69C<br>
is a perspective planar view of BTT hot/cold pack 910 and<br>
substantially flat part 912 which faces the outside and<br>
' does not touch the skin. FIG. 69D is a perspective view of<br>
hot/cold pack 910 with gel 909 being applied to the BTT<br>
area of user 911.<br>
A tube fit to match the special geometry of the BTT<br>
site and anatomy of the region with circulating water can<br>
also be use for selectively cooling or heating the brain.<br>
The BTT thermal pack can include a bag so as to avoid<br>
direct contact with the skin depending on the chemical<br>
compound used, such as heating agent to prevent any thermal<br>
injury to the skin.<br>
It is understood that a combination temperature sensor<br>
and BTT cold/heat pack can be implemented and positioned in<br>
place using the support structures described herein such as<br>
eyeglasses and any head mounted gear. The nose pads of<br>
eyeglasses can have a combination of a heat flow sensor to<br><br>
determine how fast heat is being pulled. The gradient for<br>
instance across a thin piece of Mylar indicates the<br>
direction of heat flow. It is also understood that the<br>
right nose pad of the eyeglasses have a temperature sensor<br>
and the left side has the cooling/heating device that<br>
applies or removes heat according to the temperature<br>
measured on the opposite side.<br>
It is also understood that many variations are<br>
evident to one of ordinary skill in the art and are within<br>
the scope of the invention. For instance, one can place a<br>
sensor on the skin at the BTT site and subsequently place<br>
an adhesive tape on top of said sensor to secure the sensor<br>
in position at the BTT site. Thus in this embodiment the<br>
sensor does not need to have an adhesive surface nor a<br>
support structure permanently connected to said sensor.<br>
A plurality of hand held devices with non-contact or<br>
contact sensors can measure the brain temperature at the<br>
BTT for single or continuous measurement and are referred<br>
to herein as Brain Thermometers or BrainTemp devices.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 70 shows an array 1000 of infrared<br>
sensors 1002 viewing the BTT entrance 1004 which are<br>
mounted in a housing 1006 containing a lens 100B to focus<br>
the radiation 1010 on sensor array 1000 in a manner such as<br>
that the sensor array 1000 views only the skin at the<br><br>
entrance of the BTT 1004 and a microprocessor 1012 adapted<br>
to select the highest temperature value read by an infrared<br>
sensor 1002 in the array 1000 with the highest value being<br>
displayed on display 1014. Exemplary infrared sensors for<br>
the array 100 0 include thermopile, thermocouples,<br>
pyroelectric sensors, and the like. Processor 1012<br>
processes the signal and displays in display 1014 the<br>
highest temperature value measured by the sensor 1002 in<br>
the array 1000. FIG. 71A shows another embodiment<br>
comprising of a non-contact measuring system that includes<br>
a housing 1022 containing a single infrared sensor 1018<br>
(e.g., thermopile), a lens 1016 to focus the radiation 1010<br>
of the BTT area 1004 into the sensor 1018, a transmitter<br>
1019, and an ambient temperature sensor 1020 used to adjust<br>
the temperature reading according to the ambient<br>
temperature, and processing 1012 and display means 1014 to<br>
process the signal and display a temperature value in<br>
addition to wire 1015 connected to an external module 1017<br>
with said module including a processor 1013 adapted to<br>
further process the signal such as processing spectroscopic<br>
measurements, chemical measurements, and temperature<br>
measurements with said module 1017 adapted yet to display<br>
and transmit the value calculated by processor 1013<br>
including wireless transmission and transmission over a<br><br>
distributed computer network such as the internet. An<br>
alternative for the pen-like systems in accordance with the<br>
invention and in accordance to FIG. 71A, as shown in FIG.<br>
71B, includes a bulging part 1024 with a substantially<br>
convex shape at the end 1030 that touches the skin 1026 and<br>
matches the concave anatomy of the skin 1026 entrance of<br>
the BTT 1028. The bulging convex end 1024 touching the skin<br>
1026 helps to stretch the skin 1026 and allow better<br>
emissivity of radiation in certain skin conditions,<br>
allowing the system to measure temperature in the skin of<br>
the BTT area at optimal conditions and with any type of<br>
skin.<br>
An exemplary lens system for viewing thermal radiation<br>
coming from the BTT can include exemplarily 2 5 sensors for<br>
reading at 1 inch from the tip of the sensor to the skin at<br>
the BTT entrance and 100 sensor array for reading radiation<br>
coming from a distance of 3 inches between skin at the BTT<br>
and sensor tip. Preferably a five degree field of view, and<br>
most preferably a two to three degree field of view, and<br>
yet even a one degree of field view is used to see the main<br>
entry point of the BTT. The spot size (view area) of the<br>
infrared sensor is preferably between 1 and 20 mm in<br>
diameter and most preferably between 3 and 15 mm in<br>
diameter which allows the infrared sensor to receive<br><br>
radiation from the BTT entrance area when said sensor is<br>
aimed at the BTT entrance area which corresponds to the<br>
bright spots in FIG. 1A and the red-yellow area in FIG. 1B.<br>
It is understood that an infrared device (thermopile) can<br>
be placed at any distance and read the temperature of the<br>
BTT entrance area, as long as the sensor is positioned in a<br>
manner to view the BTT entrance area and a lens is used<br>
focus the radiation on to the temperature sensor.<br>
The array is adapted to receive the temperature of the<br>
 BTT area. The temperature signal received is less than the<br>
whole face and is not the temperature of the face, nor the<br>
temperature of the forehead. The temperature signal comes<br>
from the BTT, one particular area of special geometry<br>
around the medial corner of the eye and medial aspect of<br>
the upper eyelid below the eyebrow. This said temperature<br>
signal from the BTT can be acquired by contact sensors<br>
(e.g., thermistors), non contact sensors (e.g.,<br>
thermopile), and infrared thermal imaging. This said <br>
temperature signal can be fed into a processor to act upon<br>
an article of manufacturing that can remove or transfer<br>
heat as shown in FIG. 73. With said article being<br>
activated by the temperature level measured at the BTT by a<br>
hand held single measuring device, a continuous temperature<br>
measuring device, and any of the devices of the present<br><br>
invention. In addition, the temperature level signal can<br>
activate another device and activate a function of said<br>
device. The temperature level measured by the hand held<br>
devices can be automatically transmitted by wireless or<br>
wired transmission means to a receiver.<br>
FIG. 71C shows another embodiment comprising a non-<br>
contact measuring system that includes a housing 1032<br>
containing a single infrared sensor 1034 (e.g.,<br>
thermopile), a columnar extension 103 S housing a window<br>
1039 and cavity 1038 to focus the radiation 1010 of the BTT<br>
area 1004 into the sensor 1034 which is located about 3 cm<br>
from the window 1039 of columnar extension 1036 in addition<br>
to an amplifier 1040, processing device 1042 and display<br>
device 1044 to process the signal and display the<br>
temperature value. The columnar extension may have a<br>
widthwise dimension, either as a cylinder, rectangle, or<br>
square, of less than 3mm, preferably less than 2.5 mm and<br>
most preferably less than 2.0 mm.<br>
A retractable ruler 1046 is mounted in the housing<br>
1032 and the tip of said ruler can rest on the face and<br>
used for assuring proper distance and direction of the<br>
housing in relation to the BTT for optimal view of the BTT<br>
area. It is understood that any measuring and positioning<br>
means for optimizing view of the BTT by the sensor can be<br><br>
used and are within the scope of the present invention. It<br>
is understood that any positioning device to establish a<br>
fixed relationship between the sensor and BTT are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
FIG. 72 is a schematic view of another embodiment<br>
preferably used as a single measurement by touching the<br>
skin at the BTT with a contact temperature sensor.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 72 shows a pen-like housing 1050 with a<br>
sensor 1052 (e.g., thermistor) encapsulated by an<br>
insulating tip 1054 with a substantially convex external<br>
shape to conform to the BTT area and further including wire<br>
1055 connecting sensor 1052 to processor 1056, which is in<br>
electrical connection to LCD display 1058, LED 1060, and<br>
piezoelectric device 1062. In use the sensor 1052 touches<br>
the skin at the BTT entrance area 1004 generating a voltage<br>
corresponding to the temperature, which is fed into the<br>
processor 1056 which in turn activates LED 1060 and device<br>
1062 when the highest temperature over the time of<br>
measurement is achieved, and subsequently displays the<br>
temperature in display. The sensor 1052 and encapsulating<br>
tip 1054 can be covered by the disposable cap with a convex<br>
external surface that conforms to the convex tip 1054.<br>
The temperature signal from sensor 1052 can be<br>
converted to an audio signal emitted by the piezoelectric<br><br>
device 1062 with said audio frequency proportional to the<br>
temperature level measured. In addition processor 1056 in<br>
the housing 1050 is adapted to lock in the highest<br>
frequency audio signal (which represents the highest<br>
temperature) while the user scans the BTT area.<br>
Furthermore, LED 1060 in the housing 1050 can be activated<br>
when the highest temperature level is reached, and then the<br>
value is displayed in display 1058.<br>
It is understood that any article of manufacture that<br>
transfers heat or removes heat from the body in a direct or<br>
indirect fashion can be used in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention. Accordingly FIG.73 shows other<br>
exemplary embodiments including a sensing device<br>
represented by a non-contact sensing device 1070 such a<br>
thermopile housed in a hand held device or a contact<br>
sensing device 1072 such as a thermistor housed in a patch<br>
measuring temperature in the BTT area which are coupled by<br>
wires or wireless transmission means shown previously to an<br>
article of manufacture such as mattress 1078 or a collar<br>
1080 which can alter its own temperature or the temperature<br>
in the vicinity of said articles 1078 and 1080. Exemplary<br>
embodiments include a mattress 1078. which is adapted by<br>
electrical means to change its temperature in accordance<br>
with the signal received from the temperature sensor 1070<br><br>
and 1072 measuring temperature . in the BTT area and an<br>
article around the neck such as a collar 1080. Articles<br>
1078 and 1080 are provided with a serpentine tube 1074 and<br>
1076 respectively, which run cold or hot water for removing<br>
or delivering heat to the body by mattress 1078 or to the<br>
neck and head by collar 1080, with said water system of<br>
mattress 1078 having a valve 1082 and of collar 1080 having<br>
valve 1083 which is controlled by a processor 1084 and 1085<br>
respectively. Processor 1084 of mattress 1078 and processor<br>
1085 of collar 1080 are adapted to open or close the valve<br>
1082 or 1083 based on the temperature level at the BTT<br>
measured by sensor 1070 and 1072. The signal of the<br>
temperature sensor 1070 and 1072 controls the valves 1082<br>
and 1083 that will open to allow cold fluid to fill a<br>
mattress when the signal from the sensor 1070 or 1072<br>
indicates high body temperature (e.g., temperature equal or<br>
higher than 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Likewise, when the<br>
signal from the sensor 1070 or 1072 indicates low body<br>
temperature (e.g., temperature lower than 96.8 degrees<br>
Fahrenheit) the signal from said sensors 1070 and 1072<br>
opens the valve 1082 and 1083 that allows warm fluid to<br>
fill the mattress 1078 and collar 1080. It is understood<br>
that any garment, gear, clothing, helmets, head mounted<br>
gear, eyewear, hats, and the like can function as an<br><br>
article of manufacture in which heat is removed or<br>
transferred to achieve thermal comfort of the wearer based<br>
on the temperature of the BTT area. It is also understood<br>
that any sensor, contact (e.g., thermistor) or non-contact<br>
(e.g., thermopile or thermal image sensing system),<br>
measuring temperature at the BTT can be used to control an<br>
article of manufacture removing or transferring heat to a<br>
body or physical matter. It is further understood that the<br>
article of manufacturing includes infusion lines capable of<br>
delivering warm or cold fluid into a vein of a patient in<br>
accordance with the temperature at the skin around the<br>
medial corner of the eye and eyelid, which corresponds to<br>
the entrance of the BTT. Other exemplary articles of<br>
manufacture include shoes, floor with heating or cooling<br>
systems, electrical draping, in-line fluid warmers, and the<br>
like.<br>
In the embodiment in which a contact sensor touching<br>
the skin is used, the probe head can be covered with a<br>
disposable cap, such as a piece of polymer preferably with<br>
good thermal conductivity, with the shape of the disposable<br>
cap to match the shape of the various probes in accordance<br>
with the principles and disclosure of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
In addition to measuring, storing, and transmitting<br>
biological parameters, the various apparatus of the present<br>
invention such as patches, eyewear, rings, contact lens,<br>
and the like include an identification and historical<br>
record acquisition and storage device for storing the<br>
user's identification and historical data preferably using<br>
a programmable rewritable electronic module in which data<br>
can be changed, added, or deleted from the module. The<br>
identification and historical data alone or in conjunction<br>
with the biological data (such as brain temperature and<br>
chemical measurements as glucose level and presence of<br>
antibodies) are transmitted preferably by wireless<br>
transmission to a monitoring station. Accordingly FIG.74<br>
shows a schematic view of the apparatus and system for<br>
biological monitoring, identification, and historical data<br>
used by an animal. It is understood that the system<br>
disclosed is applicable to humans as well as animals.<br>
FIG. 74 is the schematic of a preferred embodiment for<br>
four legged creatures showing an exemplary comprehensive<br>
system that includes: an eye ring transmitter device 1501<br>
with said eye loop or eye ring 1501 preferably including<br>
antenna 1500, sensor 1502, microprocessing, transmitting<br>
and memory module 1504, and power source 1503 with said<br>
ring placed on the eye preferably in the periphery of the<br><br>
eye in the eyelid pocket 1516; a collar 1520 with said<br>
collar 1520 preferably containing power source 1506,<br>
microprocessing, transmitting, and memory module 1508, and<br>
GPS transmission system 1510 coupled by wireless waves 1512<br>
to orbiting satellites 1514 and module 1508 in<br>
bidirectional communication by wireless waves 1522 to<br>
module 1504 of ring 1501 to power ring 1501 and collect<br>
data from ring 1501 with said module 1508 in communication<br>
by radio waves 1511 to external radio receiving station<br>
1509 and receiving antenna 1513; an externally placed<br>
receiver 1518 and antenna 1519 which receives the signal<br>
from module 1504 of ring 1501; and an external antenna 1524<br>
located for instance in a feed lot connected to computer<br>
1526 with said antenna 1524 in bidirectional communication<br>
with module 1504 of ring 1501.<br>
Each eye ring 1501 has a unique serial number<br>
permanently or temporarily embedded to identify the animal<br>
remotely. A 24 hour temperature log is sent at each<br>
transmission, most preferably 6-12 times per day. A unique<br>
one-way statistical broadcast network architecture allows<br>
all members of the herd to share one frequency and one set<br>
of data receivers. The receiver is designed to receive<br>
temperature telemetry data from a network of livestock eye<br><br>
ring telemetry units and forward it to a collection<br>
computer for storage, display, and monitoring.<br>
Although various communication and power systems are<br>
shown in FIG. 74, it is understood that the system can work<br>
with only one apparatus, for instance ring 1501 sending a<br>
signal to receiver 1518 and antenna 1519 for further<br>
processing and display, or preferably ring 1501<br>
transmitting data to module 1508 of collar 1520 which<br>
working as a booster radio transmitter transmits the signal<br>
to antenna 1513 and remote station 1509 for processing,<br>
monitoring, and displaying the data.<br>
It is understood that besides an active system with a<br>
battery working as the power source, a passive system in<br>
which the ring 1501 is- powered by an external source such<br>
as electromagnetic induction provided by collar 1520 or<br>
antenna 1524 can be used. It is further understood that a<br>
hybrid system that includes both a power source comprised<br>
of battery 1503 and a passive system in module 1504 can be<br>
used in which module 1504 contains an antenna for receiving<br>
electromagnetic energy from module 1508 of collar 1520. In<br>
this embodiment the active part of the system using the<br>
memory in module 1504 powered by battery 1503 collects data<br>
from a sensor 1502 (e.g., thermistor) and stores the data<br>
in a memory chip in module 1504. The passive system<br><br>
containing antenna in module 1504 can be also activated<br>
when the four legged creature passes by a coupling antenna<br>
1524, such as for instance an antenna placed in feed lots.<br>
After there is a coupling between the passive system 1504<br>
in the ring 1501 and the external antenna 1524 in the<br>
feedlot, the data stored in the memory chip of module 1504<br>
of the ring 1501 is received by the external antenna 1524<br>
and transferred to a second memory chip 1523 that is part<br>
of the module external antenna 1524. The processor of<br>
module 1504 in the ring 1501 is adapted to transfer the<br>
stored data any time that there is a coupling with the<br>
external antenna 1524. A variety of inductive coupling<br>
schemes previously mentioned can be used for powering and<br>
collecting data from eye ring 1501 by antenna 1523 and<br>
1509.<br>
The data from a plurality of mammals (e.g., cattle) is<br>
transmitted to a receiving system. Preferably only one<br>
animal transmits at a specific time (equivalent to having<br>
only one animal in the system) to avoid data collisions in<br>
the form of interference that prevents successful wireless<br>
transmission of the biological parameters. Two exemplary<br>
schemes can be used, polling and broadcast. The polling<br>
approach requires each animal to be equipped with a<br>
receiver which receives an individual serial number request<br><br>
for data from a central location and triggers that animal's<br>
transmitter to send the data log. The other approach is a<br>
broadcast system, whereby each animal independently<br>
broadcasts its data log. The problem is to avoid<br>
collisions, that is, more than one animal transmitting at a<br>
time, which could prevent successful data transfer. Each<br>
animal transmitter will preferably transmit at a certain<br>
time and the receiver is adapted to receive the signal from<br>
each animal at a time.<br>
The ring 1501 can yet include a solar battery arranged<br>
to capture sun light, digital transmission 16 bit ID# to<br>
identify the animal and track the animal throughout life.<br>
Preferred dimensions for outer diameter of ring 1501 for<br>
use in livestock are between 40 and 45 mm, preferably<br>
between 35 and 40 mm, and most preferably between 30 and 35<br>
mm or less than 30 mm. For large animals such as an<br>
elephant, such as to detect moment of ovulation for<br>
artificial insemination and birth in captivity, the<br>
preferred outer diameter is between 90 and 100 mm,<br>
preferably between 75 and 90 mm, and most preferably<br>
between 50 and 75 mm or less than 50 mm. Preferred largest<br>
dimension of ring including circuit board and battery for<br>
livestock is between 15 and 20 mm, preferably between 10<br>
and 15 mm, and most preferably less than 10mm, and for<br><br>
large animals a factor of 10 to 15 mm is added to achieve<br>
optimal dimensions. The preferred height of the ring 1501<br>
for livestock is between 9 and 12 mm, preferably 6 and 9<br>
mm, and most preferably less than 5 mm, and for large<br>
animals a factor of 5 mm is added to achieve optimal<br>
dimensions. The preferred embodiment includes hardware<br>
disposed in one quadrant of the ring which contains the<br>
sensor and is located in the inferior eyelid pocket.<br>
An alarm is activated when certain pre-set temperature<br>
limits are reached. The system of the invention can also be<br>
used with temperature being transmitted in real time for<br>
detecting the moment of heat in animals, which starts when<br>
the body temperature of the animal starts to rise. The<br>
method includes detection of heat, and then inseminating<br>
the animals preferably between 6 to 12 hours after initial<br>
detection of heat, and most preferably between 4 and 8<br>
hours after heat detection.<br>
Preferably the temperature data stored over time<br>
(e.g., 24 hours) by module 1504 or 1508 is then downloaded<br>
to a computer system such as computer 1526 adapted to<br>
identify thermal signatures. Thermal signatures are<br>
representations of the temperature changes occurring over<br>
time and that reflect a particular biological condition.<br>
Exemplary thermal signatures are depicted in FIGs. 75A to<br><br>
75E. FIG. 75A is a representation of a viral infection in<br>
which there is a relatively rapid increase in temperature,<br>
in this example there is a high temperature which<br>
corresponds to a pox virus infection such as foot and mouth<br>
disease. On the other hand a slow increase in temperature<br>
over 6 to 8 hours can indicate a thermal signature for<br>
hyperthermia due to hot weather, as shown in FIG. 75B. FIG.<br>
75C shows a rapid increase in temperature reflecting<br>
bacterial infection, with spikes followed by sustained high<br>
temperature. FIG. 75D shows a thermal signature reflecting<br>
mastitis with a double hump in which there is an initial<br>
increase in temperature followed by a higher increase after<br>
the first episode. FIG. 75E shows a thermal signature<br>
indicating heat (arrow 1544) of animals, in which there is<br>
a gradual but progressive increase of the basal<br>
temperature. About 8 to 12 hours from beginning of heat<br>
there is a further increase in temperature indicating the<br>
moment of ovulation (arrow 1546), with a further sustained<br>
increase in temperature in the post-ovulation period. It is<br>
understood that a digital library of thermal signatures can<br>
be stored and used to identify the type of biological<br>
condition present based on the signal received from the<br>
ring or any other sensor measuring temperature at the BTT,<br>
for both humans and animals. The thermal signature acquired<br><br>
by the temperature measuring system is matched by a<br>
processing system to a thermal signature stored in the<br>
memory of a computer and associated software for matching<br>
and recognition of said thermal signatures. It is<br>
understood that the thermal signatures system of the<br>
present invention includes any temperature measuring system<br>
for both animals or humans in which a temperature<br>
disturbance is present, low or high temperature.<br>
A plurality of antenna reception scheme can be used.<br>
FIG. 76A shows an exemplary antenna schemes arrangement<br>
1538 including 8 antennas numbered 1 to 8 in a pen which<br>
can be used to cover a herd of 1000 to 2000 animals. At a<br>
particular time Tl animal 1530 transmits the data which is<br>
captured by the closest antenna, for instance antenna 1532.<br>
For animal use and to preserve power the data can be stored<br>
for 24 hours and when the animal goes by one of the<br>
antennas at time Tl the data is downloaded. When there is<br>
fever or a change in biological parameter the transmitting<br>
ring transmits the data continuously. Otherwise the ring<br>
only transmits data once a day. The antenna scheme also can<br>
be used as a locator of the animal. The pen and antenna<br>
scheme is plotted in a computer screen and depicted on the<br>
screen, and by identifying the antennas receiving the<br>
signal the animal can be located with the location<br><br>
highlighted in the computer screen. In FIG. 76A antennas<br>
1534 and 153 2 are receiving the signal whereas antenna 1536<br>
is not receiving the signal since antenna 153S is distant<br>
from the animal. Therefore animal 1530 is located in the<br>
area covered by antenna 1532 and 1534. FIG. 76B shows the<br>
precise location using a radio receiver direction finder,<br>
in which a radio receiver 1540 is carried by a farmer or<br>
located in the vicinity of the area covered by antennas<br>
1532 and 1534 which contains animal with fever 1530 as well<br>
 as healthy animals 1542a, 1542b, 1542c. Since animal 1530<br>
is the only one emitting signal continuously, radio<br>
receiver 1540 can precisely identify sick animal 1530 among<br>
healthy animals. The ID of animal 1530 is transmitted in<br>
 conjunction with the biological data for further<br>
identification of animal 1530. Alternatively, a farmer uses<br>
an electromagnetic hand held external power switch next to<br>
the animal to activate the circuit in the eye ring 1501 in<br>
order to manually initiate transmission of data to a<br>
receiver for further processing. Any lost animal could also<br>
be located with the present invention and an animal which<br>
ran from the pen could be identified as not emitting a<br>
signal within the pen.<br>
Although a multiple antenna scheme is shown in FIG.<br>
76A, the preferred embodiment includes an antenna 1513 or<br><br>
alternatively antenna 1519, and a weatherproof metal cased<br>
receiver unit with radio receiver module, computer<br>
interface, and power source such as receiver 1509 or<br>
alternatively receiver 1518.<br>
When using a rewritable or programmable identification<br>
serial number, the eye ring 1501 can be reused and a new<br>
serial identification number programmed and written for<br>
said eye loop or eye ring 1501.<br>
Although a ring in the eyelid pocket is shown, it is<br>
understood that another method and device includes a<br>
temperature signal coming from the BTT of cattle external<br>
to the eye which is located in the anterior corner of the<br>
eye (corner of the eye in animals is located in the most<br>
frontal part of the eye) with said signal being captured by<br>
contact or non contact temperature sensors as well as<br>
thermal imaging.<br>
The signal from eye ring 1501 can preferably<br>
automatically activate another device. By way of<br>
illustration, a sprinkler system can be adapted to be<br>
activated by a radio signal from eye ring 1501 with said<br>
sprinkler system spraying cold water and cooling off the<br>
animal when a high body temperature signal is transmitted<br>
by eye ring 1501.<br><br>
A variety of diseases can be monitored and detected by<br>
the apparatus of the invention. By way of illustration, a<br>
characteristic increase in brain temperature can detect<br>
foot-and-mouth disease, babesiosis, botulism, rabies,<br>
brucellosis, and any other disorder characterized by<br>
changes in temperature as well as detection of disorders by<br>
chemical and physical evaluation such as detection of <br>
prions in the eyelid or eye surface of an infected animal<br>
using antibodies against such prions and creating an<br>
identifiable label such as fluorescence or by generating a<br>
mechanical or electrical signal at the time of antigen-<br>
antibody interaction. Prions can cause bovine spongiform<br>
encephalopathy known also as "mad cow" disease and such<br>
prions can be present in the eye and can be detected by<br>
using an immobilized antibody contained in the eye ring<br>
against such prion or a product of such prion. By detecting<br>
mastitis (or an animal with fever) which is scheduled for<br>
milking, the present invention provides a method to prevent<br>
contaminating other animals being milked by generating a<br>
sequence for milking in which the animal with fever is<br>
milked last. This will avoid contaminating equipment with a<br>
sick animal and with said equipment being sequentially used<br>
in other healthy animals.<br><br>
The present invention provides continuous monitoring<br>
of animals 24 hours a day from birth to slaughter with<br>
automatic analysis and detection of any disease that can<br>
cause a threat to human health or animal health, besides<br>
identification and location of the sick animal. Therefore<br>
with the present invention an animal with disease would not<br>
reach the consumer's table. The present invention therefore<br>
includes a method to increase food safety and to increase<br>
the value of the meat being consumed. The system of<br>
continuous disease monitoring is called DM24/7 (disease<br>
monitoring 24/7) and includes monitoring the biological<br>
variable 24 hours seven days a week from birth to<br>
slaughter, feeding the information into a computer system<br>
and recording that information. Any meat coming from an<br>
animal monitored with DM24/7 receives a seal called<br>
"Monitored Meat". This seal implies that the animal was<br>
monitored throughout life for the presence of infectious<br>
diseases. Any user buying "Monitored Meat" can log on the<br>
internet, and after entering the number (ID) of the meat<br>
which can be found in the package of the meat being<br>
purchased. Said user can have access to the thermal life<br>
and biological monitoring of the animal and for the<br>
presence of fever or disease of the animal which the meat<br>
was derived from. The method and device includes a video<br><br>
stream associated with the ID of the animal with said video<br>
or pictures showing the farm and information on the farm<br>
where the animal came from or the meat pack facility where<br>
the animal was processed, providing therefore a complete<br>
set of information about the animal and conditions in which<br>
such animal was raised. Besides viewing over the internet,<br>
at a private location such as at home, the system may also<br>
provide information at the point of sale. Accordingly,<br>
whenever the user purchases the product and a bar code for<br>
the product for instance is scanned, a video or photos of<br>
the farm or the company packing the meat appear on a screen<br>
at the point of sale. This method can be used when<br>
purchasing any other product and preferably allows the<br>
consumer to use idle time in the cashier's station to<br>
become more familiar with the product purchased.<br>
Preferably the ring has a temperature sensor covered<br>
by insulating material (eg. polyurethane) in one end and<br>
with an exposed surface at the other end. The preferred<br>
measuring method uses the measuring surface facing the<br>
outer part of the anatomy of the eye pocket and the<br>
insulating part facing the inner part of the eyelid pocket.<br>
The eye ring contains memory means for storing on a<br>
permanent or temporary basis a unique identification number<br>
that identifies the animal being monitored. The ID code in<br><br>
the processor of the ring is transmitted to a receiver as<br>
an individual number only for identification and tracking<br>
purposes or associated with a temperature value or other<br>
biological variable value. The memory chip in the ring can<br>
also contain the life history of- the animal and historical<br>
data including weight, vaccines, birth date, birth<br>
location, gender, diseases, genetic make up, and the like.<br>
Range of the entrance of BTT area is about 30 square<br>
cm and the general main entry point is 25 square cm and<br>
encompasses the medial corner of the eye and the area of<br>
the eyelid adjacent to' the eyelid margin. The correlation<br>
coefficient between temperature at the BTT area and the<br>
core temperature reflecting the thermal status of the brain<br>
is 0.9. Instead of using the whole face, the method for<br>
infrared or thermal imaging sensing as well as contact<br>
sensor includes a temperature signal which comes<br>
specifically from the BTT area, and the hottest spot in BTT<br>
area is then located and used as a source signal to<br>
activate another device or to deploy an action.<br>
It is understood that an infrared thermal imaging<br>
camera can also be used and the point source emitting the<br>
highest amount of radiation from the entrance of the BTT is<br>
selected by the processor in the camera and the temperature<br>
level corresponding to the point source with highest<br><br>
thermal energy is displayed in the display. Exemplary<br>
infrared cameras include the BTT Thermoscan of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The BTT Thermoscan of the present invention is adapted<br>
to view the entrance of the BTT around the medial corner of<br>
the eye, with the view of the sensor, by way of a lens,<br>
matching the entrance of the BTT area displayed in FIG. 1A<br>
and 1B, and in FIGs. 3A to 9. Exemplary operational flow<br>
for measuring the temperature at the BTT with a thermal<br>
imaging system includes the first step of viewing the<br>
entrance of the BTT by radiation detector in the camera and<br>
a processor adapted to, after the first step, to search for<br>
the point source in the thermal image of the BTT with the<br>
highest emission of thermal radiation. In the following<br>
step the temperature of the point source in the thermal<br>
image of the BTT with the highest amount of radiation is<br>
calculated, with said calculated temperature value<br>
preferably displayed. In the next step, the calculated<br>
temperature value is transmitted by wire or wireless means<br>
to an article of manufacture that can remove heat or<br>
transfer heat to the body in a direct or indirect manner.<br>
In the following step, the temperature of the article of<br>
manufacture is adjusted in accordance with the signal<br>
received. Exemplary articles of manufacture that transfer<br><br>
or remove heat from the body in an indirect manner includes<br>
the air conditioner/heater systems of vehicles. Exemplary<br>
articles of manufacture that transfer or removes heat from<br>
the body in a direct manner includes vehicle seats. The<br>
measuring system in accordance with the present invention<br>
is adapted to seek for the hottest area around the corner<br>
of the eye and eyelid. Once the hottest spot around the<br>
medial corner of the eye and eyelid is found, a second step<br>
includes finding the hottest spot in the area identified in<br>
the first step, which means to find the hottest spot on the<br>
entrance of the BTT as shown in FIGs lA and 1B.<br>
Now in accordance with another preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention shown in FIG. 77A to 77C, an<br>
apparatus comprised of a patch for use in biological<br>
monitoring according to the invention comprises two parts:<br>
a durable part containing the sensor, electronics, and<br>
power source and a disposable part void of any hardware<br>
with said two parts durable and disposable being detachably<br>
coupled to each other preferably by a hook and loop<br>
fastener material (commercially available under the trade<br>
name VELCRO) . Accordingly FIG. 77A is a schematic view<br>
showing a patch composed of two parts connected to each<br>
other by a hook and loop arrangement herein referred as<br>
VELCRO Patch with said VELCRO Patch 1591 including a<br><br>
disposable piece 1730 and durable piece 1596 with said<br>
durable, piece 1596 housing and electrically connecting<br>
sensor 1590, power source 1594, and transmitter and<br>
processor module 1592 with VELCRO surface 1598 of durable<br>
piece 1596 detachably coupled to VELCRO surface of<br>
disposable piece 1730 and the external surface of said<br>
disposable piece 1730 covered by a liner 1732 which when<br>
peeled off exposes an adhesive surface which is applied to<br>
the skin. When in use the two parts 1730 and 1596 are<br>
connected and held in place by the hook and loop material,<br>
and liner 1732 is removed to expose the adhesive covering<br>
the external surface of disposable piece 1730 with said<br>
adhesive surface being applied to the skin in order to<br>
secure said VELCRO Patch 1591 to said skin with sensor 1590<br>
resting adjacent to the entrance of the BTT to produce a<br>
signal representing by way of illustration the brain<br>
temperature. Although VELCRO hook and loop fastener was<br>
described as a preferred attachment between disposable and<br>
durable parts, it is understood that any other attachment<br>
device such as a disposable piece attached to a durable<br>
piece by means of glue, pins, and the like can be used or<br>
any other conventional fastening device.<br>
FIG. 77B shows the two parts of a VELCRO Patch<br>
comprised of a disposable part 1600 which contains only<br><br>
VELCRO material and a durable part 1596 which contains<br>
sensor 1590, power source 1594, module 1592 which includes<br>
a transmitter, processor, piezoelectric piece, buzzer, and<br>
speaker, transmitter and processor module 1592, and LED<br>
1602 electrically connected by wires contained in the<br>
VELCRO material with VELCRO surface 1598 of durable piece<br>
1596 detachably coupled to VELCRO surface 1601 of<br>
disposable piece 1600 and the external surface of said<br>
disposable piece 1600 covered by a liner 1604 located on<br>
the opposite side of loop surface 1601 of disposable piece<br>
1600 which when peeled off exposes an adhesive surface<br>
which is applied to the skin. Since the hardware housed in<br>
the durable part 1596 is relatively expensive said durable<br>
part 1596 with hardware is reusable while the disposable<br>
part 1600 can be made relatively inexpensively since it<br>
only comprises VELCRO loops and since said part is the part<br>
in contact with the skin said part 1600 may be disposed of<br>
after contacting the skin or when it is contaminated by<br>
body fluids. It is understood that the durable part can<br>
include a flexible plastic housing containing hardware and<br>
a disposable part comprised of a double coated adhesive<br>
tape. It is within the scope of the present invention to<br>
include a support structure such as a patch comprised of<br>
two parts in which a disposable part is in contact with the<br><br>
skin and a durable part housing hardware and electrical<br>
circuitry is not in contact with the skin. It is yet within<br>
the scope of the invention to include a support structure<br>
comprised of hook and loop material such as VELCRO<br>
comprised of two parts one disposable and durable part in<br>
which the disposable part is in contact with the skin and<br>
the durable part containing pieces in addition to the<br>
VELCRO material is durable and does not contact the skin.<br>
By way of illustration, but not by limitation, the durable<br>
 part of the VELCRO can contain a spring load rod plate such<br>
as found in airway dilators (trade name BreatheRight for<br>
humans and Flair for animals) and the disposable part<br>
contains a release liner and adhesive surface which goes in<br>
contact with the skin of a human or animal. Another<br>
illustration includes a durable part housing a container<br>
with fluid or chemicals to be applied to the skin and<br>
disposable part which goes in contact with the skin by<br>
means of an adhesive surface or mechanical fasteners such<br>
as elastic bands. Yet another illustration includes a watch<br>
attached to a VELCRO material working as the durable part<br>
which contains, for instance, a sensing part for measuring<br>
glucose and a disposable part. Preferably the VELCRO part<br>
containing the hooks work as the durable part and houses<br>
pieces other than the VELCRO material while the Velcro part<br><br>
containing the loops work as the disposable part which<br>
preferably is in contact with the body part such as the<br>
skin.<br>
When applied to the skin the VELCRO Patch works as one<br>
piece with durable and disposable parts connected by the<br>
hook and loop material and no hardware is visible on the<br>
surface of the durable part with the exception of a<br>
reporting device such as a LED to alert the user when the<br>
biological parameters are out of range. Accordingly FIG.<br>
77C is a schematic view showing the VELCRO Patch of FIG.<br>
77B, with said VELCRO Patch 1724 applied to the skin around<br>
the eyes 1726 and with an external surface of durable part<br>
1722 containing LED 1720 which is activated by processor<br>
and driver module (not shown) housed in the durable part<br>
1722 of VELCRO Patch 1724.<br>
VELCRO Patch of the present invention can further<br>
include attachment structure for attaching lenses to said<br>
VELCRO Patch, herein referred as VELCRO Eyewear.<br>
Accordingly FIG. 78 is a schematic view of VELCRO Eyewear<br>
1710 comprised of the durable part 1712 which houses sensor<br>
1700, power source 1706 and transmitter processor module<br>
1704 in addition to groove 1708 adapted to receive lens<br>
1702 which can slide in and be secured at groove 1708. The<br>
groove mechanism of the invention allows for any type of<br><br>
lens to be used and replaced as needed. However it is<br>
understood that a permanent attachment of the lens 1702 to<br>
the VELCRO durable part 1712 can be used. It is also<br>
understood that the VELCRO material can be made in a way to<br>
conform to the anatomy of the face and that a variety of<br>
fastening devices previously described for attaching the<br>
lens can be used. The VELCRO Eyewear can yet have temples<br>
attached to its side for further securing to the face of<br>
the user. It is also understood that any sensor can be used<br>
including temperature, pressure, piezoelectric sensors for<br>
detecting pulse of a blood vessel, glucose sensor, and the<br>
like.<br>
FIG. 79A is a perspective view showing another<br>
exemplary embodiment of a support structure 1740 comprised<br>
of a bowl-like structure with a substantially external<br>
convex surface 1742 to conform to the anatomy of the BTT<br>
entrance with said support structure 1740 housing sensor<br>
1744 and electrical connection. FIG. 79B shows another<br>
embodiment of a support structure 1748 with a substantially<br>
convex outer surface 1750 to conform to the anatomy of the<br>
BTT with structure 1748 being also substantially elongated<br>
to match the geometry of the BTT entrance and further<br>
housing sensor 1752 and electrical connection 1754.<br><br>
FIG. 80 is a cross sectional diagram of a bowl shown<br>
in FIG. 79A including a holder 175S in the shape of a bowl<br>
with an external convex surface 1757 and a sensor 1758<br>
protruding through the surface of the bowl holder 1756 with<br>
said sensor being in close apposition to the skin 1759 at<br>
the BTT and its terminal blood vessel 1755.<br>
FIG. 81A is a schematic top view of another preferred<br>
embodiment for the support structure comprised of a<br>
boomerang, or banana shape patch 1760 comprised of a thin<br>
insulating polyurethane layer 1766 housing a support<br>
structure 1762 which houses sensor 1764 with support<br>
structure 1762 having a different height than layer 1766<br>
which makes sensor 1764 to protrude and be in higher<br>
position in relation to layer 1766. Surface of layer 1766<br>
contains a pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive for securing<br>
said patch to the skin. FIG. 81B is a schematic side view<br>
of boomerang shape patch 1760 of FIG. 81A showing the<br>
different height between structure 1762, which houses<br>
sensor 1764 and wire 1765, and adhesive polyurethane layer<br>
1766. The preferred height difference between the<br>
structures 1766 and 1762 is 5 mm, and preferably between 3<br>
and 4 mm, and most preferably between 1 and 3 mm. FIG. 81C<br>
is a perspective view of patch 1760 with a release liner on<br>
the sensor area 1768 and a release liner 1773 comprised of<br><br>
two pices, a superior piece 1769 and an inferior piece<br>
1771. FIG. 81C shows the superior piece 1769 being peeled<br>
off to expose adhesive surface 1770. The release liner 1773<br>
can comprise a single section or have a single or multiple<br>
slits to make a multiple section release liner. Suitable<br>
release liners for use with an adhesive layer are known in<br>
the art. According to this embodiment, when applying patch<br>
1760 to the BTT area, sensor liner piece 1768 can be<br>
removed first and patch 1760 is then positioned with the<br>
 sensor area aligned with the entrance of the BTT. Once the <br>
proper final position of the patch 1760 is determined,<br>
inferior piece liner 1771 is removed and patch 1760 applied<br>
to the nose area, and then superior piece liner 1769 can be<br>
removed and applied to the skin above the eyelid margin.<br>
FIG. 81D is a perspective view showing patch 1760 being<br>
applied to the skin of user 1770 with external markings on<br>
patch 1760 indicating sensor position 1768 and line 1772<br>
for aligning with the corner of the eye. It is understood<br>
that the present invention includes a sensor arrangement<br>
within a support structure in which said sensor is located<br>
at a different height than the basic larger support<br>
structure comprising the patch.<br>
FIG. 82 is a schematic top view of eyewear showing an<br>
exemplary electrical arrangement for support structure<br><br>
comprised of modified nose pads and frame of eyewear with<br>
said frame of eyewear 1880 including electromagnetic switch<br>
 1774 in left lens rim 1776 and magnetic rod 1778 in left<br>
temple 1882 for electrically turning the system on when in<br>
electrical contact, transmitter and power source module<br>
1884 in nose bridge 1886 is electrically connected by wire<br>
1888 in lens rim 1776 to switch 1774, and antenna 1890 in<br>
right lens rim 1892 connected to module 1884. When the<br>
temples are opened for using the eyewear an electrical<br>
 connection is established between switch 1774 and magnetic<br>
rod 1778 which automatically activates the system. It is<br>
understood that a variety of spring mechanisms can be<br>
integrated into a shaft holding the sensors for better<br>
apposition of said sensors to the BTT area.<br>
The present invention provides a method for optimizing<br>
fluid intake to achieve euhydration and avoid dehydration<br>
and overhydration. The present invention provides a<br>
continuous noninvasive core temperature monitoring, and<br>
when the temperature reaches certain pre-set levels such as<br>
increased temperature which reflects increased heat stored<br>
in the body, then by ingesting fluid the temperature can be<br>
lowered. Brain temperature reflects the hydration status<br>
and dehydration leads to an increase in the core (brain)<br>
temperature. The method in accordance with the- present<br><br>
invention includes an algorithm for use in the situation of<br>
dehydrated, sedentary people exposed to heat (as<br>
illustrated by the excess mortality during heat waves), and<br>
people during physical activities. The invention showed<br>
that ingestion of 4 ounces of water every hour after body<br>
temperature reaches 100.4 degrees F will lower the body<br>
temperature to 98.6 degrees F and will keep the body<br>
temperature at lower than 9 9.5 degrees F thus preventing<br>
the dangers of heat stroke. In case of athletes in athletic<br>
activities such as cycling, the invention showed that<br>
ingestion with fluid containing carbohydrates and minerals<br>
(e.g., trade name PowerAde of the Coca-Cola Company) can<br>
keep peak performance with ingestion of 6 to 8 ounces when<br>
the temperature at the BTT reaches 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit <br>
and performance is maintained with ingestion every 1 to 2<br>
hours. A variety of algorithms for use in the situation of<br>
athletes at risk of overheating, can be created based on<br>
the principle of the invention. Special size containers for<br>
fluid or water can be used by an athlete who is aware of<br>
the fluid intake needed during a competition.<br>
A method and algorithm to couple temperature<br>
(hypothermia) to nourishment (malnutrition) in elderly and<br>
in anorexia nervosa can be created, with the temperature<br>
level indicating malnutrition and further indicating what<br><br>
food to ingest to maintain adequate temperature. It is<br>
further understood that foods can be developed based on<br>
body temperature to achieve optimal nutritional value<br>
fresh and frozen, or processed foods. It is yet understood<br>
that temperature changes indicating ovulation can be used<br>
as a method to create foods that increase fertility by<br>
identifying what food articles increase ovulation.<br>
The present invention also provides methods and<br>
devices for evaluating diet such as caloric restriction in<br>
which the temperature indicates the metabolism and<br>
therefore a lower basal temperature indicates reduced<br>
metabolism and metabolic waste products including<br>
monitoring carbohydrate intake and metabolism. The present<br>
invention also provides methods for monitoring hypoglycemia<br>
in diabetes in which lowering of the temperature is a<br>
predictor of a hypoglycemic event. The invention also<br>
provides methods for detecting pulmonary infarction and<br>
cardiac events which are associated with a particular<br>
increase in temperature. Any condition which is associated<br>
with a change in temperature can be predicted and detected<br>
by the present invention from pregnancy disorders coupled<br>
to hypothermia to hyperthermia in head trauma.<br>
The present invention provides a variety of other<br>
benefits. Other exemplary benefits include: 1. monitoring<br><br>
Multiple Sclerosis since increase in brain temperature can<br>
lead to worsening of the condition, and a corrective<br>
measure can be taken when the present invention identifies<br>
such increase in temperature, such as by drinking cold<br>
liquids at the appropriate time or cooling off the brain as<br>
previously described, 2. significant differences between<br>
left and right BTT can indicate a pathological central<br>
nervous system condition, 3. detecting increased brain<br>
temperature to reinforce diagnosis of meningitis or<br>
 encephalitis and thus avoid excess use of lumbar tap in<br>
people without the infection, and 4. Young babies cannot<br>
regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults<br>
do and can easily become too hot. Sudden Infant Death<br>
Syndrome (SIDS) is more common in babies who have become<br>
overheated. By monitoring babies' temperature the present<br>
invention can alert parents in case the baby's temperature<br>
increases.<br>
A receiver receiving signal from the sensor system of<br>
the present invention can be external or implantable. When<br>
implantable inside the body the receiver can be powered by<br>
magnetic induction externally or batteries recharged<br>
externally. The receiver receives the signal from a<br>
temperature sensor, glucose sensor, or the like and<br>
retransmits the signals for further display.<br><br>
Any transmitter of the present invention can be<br>
integrated with Bluetooth, GRPS data transmission, and the<br>
like. The signal from the transmitter then can be captured<br>
by any Bluetooth enabled device such as cell phones,<br>
electronic organizers, computers, and the like. Software of<br>
the cell phone can be modified to receive the coded signal<br>
from a transmitter. Algorithm in the receiver will decript<br>
the signal and display the value. A cell phone can have an<br>
auto dial to call a doctor for example when fever is noted.<br>
It is understood that the signal from a cell phone or a<br>
signal directly from the transmitter of the support<br>
structure can be transmitted to a computer connected to the<br>
internet for further transmission over a distributed<br>
computer network.<br>
The prior art used facial skin temperature as<br>
detecting means for monitoring body temperature. As seen in<br>
Figs. 1A and 1B, temperature of the skin on the face varies<br>
significantly from area to area and is not representative<br>
of the core temperature. In addition facial skin<br>
 temperature does not deliver thermal energy in a stable<br>
fashion. Any device or method that uses facial skin<br>
temperature to activate another device or monitor<br>
temperature of the body will not provide a precise nor<br>
accurate response. In addition facial skin temperature does<br><br>
not represent the thermal status of the body and has a poor<br>
correlation with core and brain temperature. The only skin<br>
surface of the body which is in direct and undisturbed<br>
communication with inside the body is the specialized area<br>
of special geometry located at the entrance of the BTT. Any<br>
temperature sensing device placed on or adjacent to the BTT<br>
entrance can measure core temperature in a precise and<br>
accurate manner. It is understood that any sensor<br>
including a colorimetric sticker such as with liquid<br>
crystal colorimetric thermometers can be used and placed on<br>
the skin at the entrance of the BTT area, and are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
Now referring to the previously described automated<br>
climate control system, an exemplary embodiment will be<br>
described in more detail. Although this exemplary preferred<br>
embodiment will be described for climate control in the<br>
cabin of a transportation vehicle (e.g., car) it is<br>
understood that the method, device and system can apply to<br>
any confined environment such as home, work place, a hotel<br>
room, and the like in which the temperature inside the<br>
confined environment is adjusted based on the temperature<br>
at the BTT for achieving thermal comfort for the subject<br>
inside the confined environment.<br><br>
The temperature measurement at the BTT represents the<br>
thermal comfort of the body. Investigation by the present<br>
invention showed that the thermal comfort of the body is<br>
reduced as the temperature of the body increases or<br>
decreases reflected by a change in brain temperature at the<br>
BTT. Thermal comfort of a human being is reflected by the<br>
skin temperature at the BTT, with higher skin temperature<br>
at the BTT generating a hot body sensation, while a lower<br>
skin temperature at the BTT generates a cold body<br>
sensation. In order to achieve thermal comfort for the<br>
occupants of a cabin the system of the invention manages<br>
cabin thermal comfort from the temperature signal generated<br>
at the BTT. The present invention preferably uses a<br>
particular specialized area in the face, and not the whole<br>
face to manage the cabin temperature and cabin thermal<br>
comfort. The present invention system preferably monitors<br>
temperature in less than the whole face which causes an<br>
optimal control of the heating and cooling of the cabin to<br>
achieve thermal comfort of the occupant of the cabin.<br>
Since thermal comfort is reflected in the brain<br>
temperature adjusting the climate cabin based on the<br>
temperature of the BTT will provide a thermally comfortable<br>
environment for the occupant of the cabin. The BTT<br>
temperature is set for controlling the HVAC (heater-air<br><br>
condicioner) and other parts of the vehicle previously<br>
mentioned such as seats, carpets, and the like, which are<br>
adjusted to maintain the occupant's thermal sensation in a<br>
comfortable state. In particular, articles in contact or<br>
adjacent to the body are used to automatically remove or<br>
apply heat to the occupant's body based on the BTT signal.<br>
To further improve thermal comfort, the system includes a<br>
temperature sensor in the cabin for detecting cabin<br>
temperature. Accordingly, FIG. 83 shows an exemplary<br>
automated climate control system which includes BTT<br>
temperature sensing device 1894 for contact measurements<br>
(e.g., eyewear) and 1895 for non-contact measurements<br>
(e.g., infrared detector) for monitoring temperature at the<br>
BTT, control device 1896 adapted to automatically adjust<br>
articles 1898 in the cabin 1900 for removing or delivering<br>
heat based on the signal generated by BTT sensing device<br>
1894, a cabin temperature sensor 1902 to detect the<br>
temperature in the cabin 1900, and an article 1898 inside<br>
the cabin adapted to remove heat when the signal from BTT<br>
sensor 1894 indicates high temperature or to deliver heat<br>
when the BTT sensor 1894 indicates low temperature.<br>
Although for illustration purposes a vehicle seat will be<br>
used as an article for removing/delivering heat, it is<br>
understood that other articles such as HVAC, carpet,<br><br>
steering wheel, and other articles previously mentioned can<br>
be used. As soon as the vehicle is started, the cabin<br>
sensor 1902 detects the cabin temperature and adjusts the<br>
article 1898 for removing or delivering heat based on the<br>
temperature signal from the cabin sensor 1902 . Next or<br>
simultaneous with measurement of cabin temperature by<br>
sensor 1902, the output of BTT sensor 1894 is fed into<br>
control device 1896 which activates article 1898 to remove<br>
or deliver heat based on the signal from the BTT sensor<br>
1894. If the BTT sensor 1894 indicates HIGH (&gt;98.8°F) then<br>
article 1898 will remove heat, and if LOW (
detected by BTT sensor 1894 then article 1898 will deliver<br>
heat, in order to achieve cabin thermal comfort. An<br>
exemplary embodiment for cooling includes control means<br>
1896 connected to an air-conditioning control system for<br>
managing the amount of cool air being generated and blown<br>
in a proportional manner according to the temperature level<br>
output by BTT sensor 1894. For heating exemplarily the<br>
control device 1896 can be connected to a control system<br>
1906 which gradually adjusts heat delivery by an<br>
electrically-based vehicle seat 1898 according to the<br>
output level by BTT sensor 1894. Control device 1896 is<br>
adapted to remain neutral and not to adjust article 1898<br>
when temperature at the BTT is within97.5°F and 98.8°F.<br><br>
Since thermal comfort can vary from person to person, the<br>
system can be adapted for removing or delivering heat<br>
according to specific temperature thresholds in accordance<br>
with the occupant's individual needs, and not necessarily<br>
in accordance to defaults set at97.5°F and 98.8°F. It is<br>
understood that a combination of skin sensors placed in<br>
other parts of the body can be used in conjunction with BTT<br>
sensor 1894. It is yet understood that the rate of change<br>
in the skin temperature can be accounted for and fed into<br>
microcontroller which is adapted to adjust articles based<br>
on a large variation of skin temperature at the BTT site,<br>
with for instance a sudden cooling of the body of more than<br>
0.6 degrees generating a corresponding decrease in the<br>
amount of cool air being generated or even shutting off an<br>
air conditioner system. It is also understood that BTT<br>
sensing devices include contact device (e.g., patches and<br>
eyewear of the present invention), non-contact devices<br>
(e.g., infrared devices of the present invention), thermal<br>
imaging (e.g., BTT Thermoscan of the present invention),<br>
and the like.<br>
Yet another embodiment according to the present<br>
invention includes a support structure containing a sensor<br>
to measure biological parameters connected to a nasal<br>
strip for dilating airways of humans such as Breathe Right<br><br>
(commercially available under Che trade name BreatheRight)<br>
and for dilating airway passages of animals (commercially<br>
available under the trade name Flair). Exemplary air<br>
dilator nasal strips were described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,533,503 and 5,913,873. The present invention incorporates<br>
airway dilators into patches for biological monitoring. The<br>
present invention can be an integral part of an airway<br>
dilator. The airway dilators can be an extension of the<br>
present invention. The coupling of a patch measuring<br>
biological parameters and an air dilator is convenient and<br>
beneficial since both are useful in the same activities.<br>
Nasal airway dilators are beneficial during sleeping, in<br>
athletic activities, or when suffering from a cold or<br>
respiratory infections and the patch of the present<br>
invention is used during sleeping, monitoring temperature<br>
changes in athletic activities, and monitoring fever during<br>
respiratory infections. Both nasal airway dilators and the<br>
patch of the present invention use an adhesive in its<br>
backing to secure to the skin and both are secured to the<br>
skin over the nasal bones, the patch of BTT located in the<br>
superior aspect of the nasal bone and the air dilator<br>
preferably in the inferior aspect of the nasal bone. The<br>
nasal airway dilator extension of the patch of the present<br>
invention is referred to herein as BioMonitor Dilator<br><br>
(BMD) . Accordingly, FIG. 84 is a front perspective view of<br>
a preferred embodiment showing a person 100 wearing a BMD<br>
1908	including a support structure comprised of a patch 109<br>

switch, as previously described. It is understood that kit<br>
1918 can include only a patch with the magnet 1923 adjacent<br>
to said patch 1922. The watch 1922 preferably has a slanted<br>
surface for better viewing during athletic activities such<br>
as during cycling with the field of view of the watch 1926<br>
directed at an angle toward the face of the cyclist, so<br>
just by looking down and without turning the head the user<br>
can see the temperature level displayed on the watch 1926.<br>
A further embodiment shown in FIG. 85C includes a kit 1932<br>
containing specialized BMD patch 1928 and a receiver 1930<br>
illustrated as a watch.<br>
Another embodiment includes shoes with temperature<br>
sensor for detecting cold and with a radio transmitter to<br><br>
transmit the signal to a receiver (e.g., Watch). The signal<br>
from the shoe in conjunction with the signal from the<br>
TempAlert at the BTT provides a combination of preventive<br>
device against both frostbite and hypothermia.<br>
It is understood that the support structure such as a<br>
patch may house vapors and when the outer surface of the<br>
patch is scratched mentholated vapors can be released to<br>
