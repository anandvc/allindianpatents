FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method of enzymatic polishing of rice.<br>
This invention further relates to a method of enzymatic polishing of brown rice to<br>
improve its cooing quality and texture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Brown rice contains more nutritional components, such as dietary fibres,<br>
essential amino acids, minerals, proteins, vitamins and other non-nutrient<br>
essential phytochemicals (phenolic compounds), than the ordinary milled rice.<br>
These are contained in the germ and outer layers of the starchy endoperm,<br>
which are removed as bran during whitening or milling operation. However,<br>
brown rice has lost its appeal due to its hard texture, nutty taste, dark colour,<br>
higher cooking time and lower shelf life. A number of methods of polishing and<br>
washing brown rice are known in the art. Korean Patent Publication No. KP<br>
8402120 to satake Eng Co. Ltd. discloses a method of producing rice of<br>
superhigh gloss by polishing rice grains to under 96%, referred to brown rice and<br>
by directing a cool air stream on them to lower the temperature and to humidify<br>
them. This is followed by rubbing the surfaces to polish them and produce rice of<br>
extra high polish, without any cracks and with high surface hardness.<br>
JP 3114423 to Hirose Mfg Co. Ltd. discloses a method of polishing rice with a<br>
little water, with the help of an erected screw, a rotary rice stirrer and polisher in<br>
a rice washing tub. The among the rice grains caused by differences of rotation<br>
for a stirring vane.<br>
Mechanical milling results in lower head rice yield with loss of major nutrients.<br>
Largest proportion of the gross nutrients concentrated in the bran layers, outside<br>
the starchy endosperm of rice are removed during milling operation.<br><br><br>
According to nutritionists brown rice should be preferred because of its high<br>
nutritional value. Removal of bran layers in the milling process improves the<br>
appearance, cooking quality and palatability of rice though major loss of<br>
nutrients and high percentage of brokens result during mechanical milling.<br>
Therefore, the need exists of produce rice, with minimum breakage, retaining<br>
the maximum possible nutrients of brown rice and with preferably cooking<br>
attributes.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a process for the enzymatic<br>
polishing of brown rice, which is nutritionally richer than milled rice.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a process for the enzymatic<br>
polishing of brown rice, which allows the rice to retain the bran phytochemicals<br>
in comparison to mechanically milled rice.<br>
It is a further object to propose a process for the enzymatic polishing of brown<br>
rice, which yields rice with better cooking quality and texture.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from<br>
the ensuing description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
According to this invention is provided a process for the enzymatic polishing of<br>
brown rice.<br>
In accordance with this process rice is polished in a more selective way with the<br>
help of xylanase and cellulase enzymes. Brown rice is soaked in water at 30-<br>
35oC for 12 to 48 hrs and for another 30 m to 4 hrs at 60 to 65°C attain a<br><br>
saturated moisture level of 35-39%, which lead to an increase in GABA<br>
concentration. Calcium carbonate is added to water and the rice grains are kept<br>
therein for 30 to 60 mih. Enzymatic treatment is done for 1 to 3 hrs at 30 to<br>
55°C. The enzymes acted upon the non-starch polysaccharides of the bran layers<br>
releasing their monomeric sugar constituents. The rice grains are then washed to<br>
remove the enzymes, steamed in a preheated autoclave for 10 to 40 min under,<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
The enzymes used are hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases, xylanases etc,<br>
which selectively degrade the rice bran layers. The enzymes are produced from<br>
Aspergillus sp and Trichoderma sp respectively. Xylanase enzyme was produced<br>
through solid-state fermentation by growing Aspergillus awamori on wheat bran<br>
according to the method of (Koremelink et al., 1991); cellulase enzyme was<br>
produced through solid -state fermentation by growing Trichoderma reesei Rut<br>
C-390 on Ocimum gratissimum seeds and sawdust according to the method of<br>
(Das, Banerjee &amp; Bal, 2006). The crude enzymes were centrifuged and<br>
supernatant enzymes were concentrated by Ultra Filtration.<br>
Steaming of hydrated and enzyme treated rice grain was carried out to complete<br>
the gelatinization process as well as to deactivate the left over enzyme. Enzyme<br>
treated rice was steamed in a preheated autoclave at atmospheric pressure.<br>
Steaming time and pressure were judiciously controlled because intense heat<br>
and pressure hardens the grain excessively and depends it color while<br>
incomplete gelatinization of rice starch produces opaque white belly at the core<br>
of the rice kernel, which makes it prone to breakage. Relatively low-pressure<br>
steam is used to obtain high colored/translucent steamed rice. Optimum time of<br>
steaming was found to be 20 min for the production of translucent, light colored<br>
grains.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of this invention is proposed a combination<br>
preparation for hydrolytic enzymes used for bio-polishing of rice. The xylanaese<br>
is used in 200-300 IU/ml and cellulase in 30-40 IU/ml.<br>
In a preferred embodiment 256 IU/ml of xylanase and 36 IU/ml cellulase is used<br>
for treating the rice grains.	<br>
According to an embodiment is disclosed a formulation comprising a mixture of<br>
enzymes with additives, for bio-polishing of rice. Calcium carbonate is used as an<br>
additive for fortification of the polished rice. A 02% to 0.8% solution of calcium<br>
carbonate is generally employed and 0.5% being the preferred concentration.<br>
The invention will now be explained with the help of the following non-limiting<br>
examples.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Freshly harvested, PUSA Basmati, long and slender variety of paddy has been<br>
procured from Haryana, India. Paddy was harvested in October 2005 and<br>
contained 20% moisture. After 24 h from harvesting, it was sun-dried to about<br>
11-12% moisture content (wet basis) and was stored in airtight containers for 30<br>
days at ambient temperature (30±2°C). Paddy was dehulled and broken grains<br>
were removed using laboratory grader and head brown rice was used.<br>
All Chemicals were procured from Merck, India and Sigma Co., USA.<br>
Enzymatic treatment of rice<br>
10g of brown rice grain was soaked in 50 ml water for 24h. Water was changed<br>
at regular intervals for minimizing bacterial contamination. Rice grain was soaked<br>
for another 1h in 50 ml fresh water at 60-65°C (10°C below its gelatinization<br>
temperature) to saturate the grains to a moisture content of 37-39%. 0.5%<br><br>
(0.25g) of calcium carbonate was added to water and kept for another 30 min.<br>
The absorbed calcium ions acted as an inducer for the enzyme activity. Rice<br>
grain was strained out and washed in water to remove excess calcium carbonate<br>
and then treated with 15 ml of xylanase and cellulose enzyme solutions, buffered<br>
at pH 5) 256 IU/ml and 36 IU/ml respectively for 2 h at 50°C. Rice grain was<br>
strained out and washed to remove the enzymes. The superficial water was<br>
blotted off and then steamed in a preheated autoclave for 20 min under<br>
atmospheric pressure for complete gelatinization of the rice grains.<br>
The polished rice was then subjected to various physico-chemical tests for<br>
evaluation of its properties.<br>
Brown rice was polished in abrasive polisher for 120s with Degree of Milling ≥<br>
10% to get the milled rice. The polished rice grains were packed in plastic<br>
containers and kept at ambient condition. Experiments were done in triplicate<br>
and average data was used for analysis. Brown rice was taken as the control and<br>
result of experiments carried out with enzyme treated rice and milled rice was<br>
compared to that of the control.<br>
Estimation of total protein, crude fibre and crude oil in rice<br>
Protein content of PUSA basmati brown rice was estimated to be 8.93%. The<br>
protein content was as high as 7.68% through enzymatic treatment of rice and<br>
through mechanical milling the value reduced to 7.28%. Much of the nascent<br>
proteins of bran are bound in glycosidic linkages and held within the fibrous<br>
matrix of the bran in brown rice. Mechanical milling has.resulted in major loss of<br>
the protein due to the removal of the bran layers. The crude fibre content in<br>
brown rice and enzyme treated rice was estimated to be 1.86% and 1.48%,<br>
respectively. 20% reduction in crude fibre content was observed on enzymatic<br>
treatment of rice. Oil content of PUSA basmati brown rice was estimated to be<br>
19%, however, through enzymatic treatment of brown rice, oil content<br><br><br>
decreased to 16%. Both, high fibre and oil content in brown rice as responsible<br>
for its nutty and chewy taste. The reduction in fibre and oil content yielded with<br>
soft textured rice (details given in Part B).<br>
Detection of Gamma aminobutvric acid (GABA) through TLC<br>
GABA accumulates during the soaking of rice grains in water at 30-35°C for more<br>
than 20 h. GABA is a neutraceutical compound and methods to increase GABA<br>
concentrations of food are now in study. GABA is rice grains is synthesized from<br>
glutamic acid by glutamate decarboxylase, GAD, and the activity of GAD shows<br>
high correlation with the germination ratio. The presence of GABA in the cooked<br>
enzyme treated rice and its absence in cooked brown rice was detected through<br>
thin layer chromatography.<br>
Total phenolic content (TPC) of rice<br>
Phenolic compounds are potent natural antioxidants which act both by reducing<br>
the content of toxic compounds in foods and by supplying the human body with<br>
exogenous antioxidants. Rice bran exclusively consisted of benzoic acid<br>
derivatives such as gallic, protocatechuic and vanillic acids. The phenolic<br>
compounds may contribute directly to antioxidative action. Significant differences<br>
were observed for TPC among the rice types. Highest TPC was observed for<br>
controlled brown rice (190.75 µg of gallic acid equivalent/g of rice) followed by<br>
enzyme treated rice (156.45 µg of gallic acid equivalent/g of rice) while lowest<br>
for milled rice (34.3 µg of gallic acid equivalent /g of rice).<br>
Mechanical milling causes a major loss in Vitamin Thiamine. Significant loss of<br>
Thiamine (65%), Pyridoxine (90%), Niacin (57%) and Riboflavin (&gt;90%) was<br>
observed due to mechanical milling over brown rice. Selective bio-polishing of<br>
rice has helped to retain the major vitamins for brown rice even after cooking,<br>
with minor loss tin Thiamine (19%), Niacin (3.4%), Pyridoxine (1%) and<br><br><br>
Riboflavin (81%) mostly due to the loss of water soluble fractions during soaking<br>
of rice.<br>
It is seen that minor losses of microelements such as Zn, and Fe, and major<br>
losses of macro-elements such as Ca occur due to mechanical milling. This<br>
suggested that micro-elements seem to be uniformly distributed in the grain,<br>
contrasting with the macro-elements that seem to be present in external layers,<br>
aleurone and pericarp and are therefore more affected by the mechanical milling<br>
process. Significant loss of calcium (65%), Magnesium (28%), Iron (27%) and<br>
Zinc (21%) is observed due to mechanical milling in comparison to brown rice.<br>
Selective bio-polishing of rice has helped to retain the minerals with minor losses<br>
in Magnesium (6%), Iron (26%), Zinc (5%), while Calcium content increased by<br>
10% may be due to calcium fortification of rice with calcium carbonate<br>
treatment.<br>
The cooking time of enzyme treated rice is reduced by more or less 15 min with<br>
relatively higher water absorbing capacity, volume expansion ratio and grain<br>
elongation ratio over brown rice. Degradation of the fibrous bran layers with<br>
enzymes allowed easy diffusion of water and the starch granules to expand<br>
naturally on cooking.<br><br>
Brown rice is polished with biocatalysts in a selective way, keeping in view, the<br>
health benefits of brown rice. Selective degradation of bran layers has facilitated<br>
the retention of vital nutrients and non-nutrient phytochemicals and thereby<br>
retaining the antioxidant properties of rice. Enzyme treated brown rice proved<br>
nutritionally better than milled rice and resulted with better cooking qualities<br>
than brown rice. Softer, nutritious, bio-polished rice are produced with no loss in<br>
head rice yield. Therefore, enzyme treated rice can be the better alternative for<br>
milled rice or brown rice.<br><br>
