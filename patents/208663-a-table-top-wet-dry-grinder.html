This invention, in general, relates to grinding machine. In particular, this invention relates to an improved table top wet/dry grinder. It is well nova in the state of art, there ^re various kinds of grinders suited to various applications.<br>
At the outset, there are two basic kinds of grinders known in the art. Grinders operate by a prime mover hitherto known belong to one of the following two basic models.<br>
The salient features of these two types of grinders are described herein.<br>
1. Grinder consist of a drum fitted to a heavy cylindrical base stone with a hemispherical pit in its center in which is seated a cylindrical stone with round-ends. This cylindrical grinding stone is held in an inclined position of about 10 degrees to vertical, and the base stone coupled to a prime mover, genially by an electric motor,<br>
using a 'V belt.<br>
Any food or substance to be ground is loaded in the drum. When the bay  stone is rotated and the cylindrical grinding stone is held at an inclined angle of about 10 degrees to vertical with a flat wiper, the centrifugal force in the pit brings the substance to be ground in the gap between rotating cavity and grinding stone, the substance is powdered or pulverized in the presence of water or any such liquid by the frictional force garneted between the stone surfaces.<br>
This arrangements, though in practice for a long time, has been analyzed and found to suffer from following drawbacks:<br>
a)	Because of the heavy weight of the base rotating stone and grinding stone much of the energy is wasted in rotating the base stone and only a small amount (about 25 %) of energy is utilized in grinding the substance.<br>
b)	Of this energy available, much energy is lost in friction because of the non-critical dimensions of the stone components involved and the operating speeds.    These<br><br>
factors have not been systematically studied and scientifically analysed to arrive at critical figures for efficient operation.<br>
c)	Because of unnecessarily large rubbing  ton between stones, a large amount of heat is generated, thus wasting additional energy.<br>
d)	Because of excess heat generated, the ground food item looses its freshness and taste.<br>
e)	Because of the shape of the stones, there are chances of ground substance being of non uniform consistency.<br>
2. The other model consists of a drum fitted to a flat stone over which a set of cylindrical or conical stone rollers are made to rest. When the drum rotates, the roller stones roll in the same position and grinds the contents in the surface between roller stones and flat stone.<br>
This model also suffers from some of the draw backs of the previous models like<br>
1.	More grinding time<br>
2.	Excess power consumption<br>
3.	Inconsistent grinding<br>
Present invention is aimed to obviate the aforesaid problem associated with this prior art device.<br>
Research and Development are initiated in improving the efficiency and performance characteristics of the grinder. This invention is addressed to the problems associated with prior art and comes out with a solution which forms the subject matter of this invention.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to improve tie efficiency of grinding and reduce the time and power consumption and at the same time to obtain fresh and tasty ground food item with a longer shelf he. This is accomplished by increasing the grinding surface area by way of mounting an assembly of three truncated conical roller stones in such a way that the bottom two roller stones rest over the base stone of the drum and a third top roller stone is seated over the bottom roller stones.<br><br>
Under these conditions, the same surface speed of base stone and three roller stones is maintained, which facilitates uniform grinding at all the contact surfaces.<br>
The entire arrangement is provided with a cylindrical drum fixed to a flat-cylindrical base stone mounted over a drive shaft coupled to a prime mover by mechanical means. The three-stone roller assembly is mounted and held between the base stone and the locker arm. This develops four-line contact surfaces between rolling stones which enhances the efficiency of the grinder. The taper angle of the cone of roller stones and the angle of their axles fixed to central rod to the assembly is so designed to guarantee uniformly distributed surface pressure and faster grinding. The two bottom rolling stones are held to the base stone and third upper rolling stone is held to the two bottom rolling stones at a predetermined pressure.<br>
The most critical part of the innovation is the three truncated roller stone assembly with the axis of rotation of the third upper roller stone merging with the axis of central post of the assembly. The pair of truncated conical stones are located with their axles fixed diametrically opposite to central post and the top upper truncated conical roller stone is assembled to rotate on a vertical axis over the central post of the assembly and seating over the bottom pair of rouging stones. This third upper roller stone has an management to engage with bottom to conical roller stones under its own weight or under a separate predetermined spring loaded pressure.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to invent and construct a novel grinder which is efficient.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a grinder wherein the grinder has novel rolling stone assembly consisting of three truncated conical stones.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent and construct a novel grinder which is adopted to save power and energy.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent and construct a novel grinder with which the grinding time is considerably reduced.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent and construct a novel grinder which can be safely used / operated<br>
Further objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
A table top grinder comprising a detachable rotatable drum having a stone base fitted to a central shaft, the shaft being connected mechanically to a p-time mover, the said prime mover being located adjacently in the same housing, a roller stone assembly consisting of three conical shaped stones each smoothly rotating over the respective shaft and rigidly fixed to the centralized roller frame, such that ties axis of all the three rolling stones are in the same plane, the roller stone  seemly being accommodated over the central guide pin located at the canter of the stone base of the drum and beneath the locking arm central slot, such that when the drum rotates, three rolling stones rotate, the bottom two conical roller stones over the base stone surface and third upper roller stone over the two bottom conical roller stones, creating thereby four lines of contact surfaces which enhances the efficiency of the grinder.<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail by way of illustration only and with reference to the accompany  drawings  herein<br>

Now referring to drawings, the invention constitutes a drum assembly which consists of cylindrical drum (10) fixed to the flat stone base (4) and having an adapter (3) fitted at the centre. The dram assembly fate over the drive shaft (1) which gets drive from motor (19) through pulleys (2 &amp; 20) and belt (21). The roller stone  seemly consists of three truncated conical stones (5,5 &amp; 9) rotatably mounted on two axles (6 &amp; 6) and assembly post (11).<br>
The roller stone assembly is mounted on the central pin (22) fixed to tiff base stone (4) with the female portion of post engaging to the male portion of a  (3). At this position the locking arm (13) is swung to close over the drum until a click sound is heard The locking pin (17) gets engaged with the bottom of the press pad (15) and keeps the top lid (23) in position. While closing, it is ensured that the centrally located socket portion (14) of the locking arm (13) gets correctly engaged to top plunger (12) of roller stone assembly post (11). Plunger (12) is housed with a compression spring (7) inside the post (11). On locking the arm (13), the spring (7) is compressed, the bottom two roller stones (5 &amp; 5) come in contact with the base stone surface and is in a position to roll once the drum starts rotating.<br>
The third upper truncated conical stone roller (9) with its vertical rotating axis rests snugly over the bottom pair of conical stone trolley  (5 &amp; 5) by its own weight or under pressure of an additional spring housed on the post (11).<br>
With this arrangement when the pair of laky  roller stones (5 &amp; 5) start rotating due to the surface contect, the upper roller stone (9) also rotates creating additional two grinding surface areas on either side. The whole arrangement of motor (19), connecting pulleys (2 &amp; 20), drive shaft (1) with its bearing (24) are housed inside a body cover (18). The top lid (23) with the locking arm (13) is hinged to tiie body cover (18) through arm support (8) facilitating opening and closing of the lid (23) along with the locking arm (13).<br><br>
For removing the roller stone assembly, the locking arm (13) is released from the locked position by pressing the press pad (15) and swung open and the post (11) of roller stone assembly is held and lifted up. For removing the drum assembly, drum is held manually and lifted up.<br>
The adapter (3) transmits mechanical energy from the drive shaft (1) to the drum (10),<br>
For grinding the material, drum assembly and roller stone assembly are mounted in their respective locations and the locking arm (13) with the lid (23) is clod  and locked.
