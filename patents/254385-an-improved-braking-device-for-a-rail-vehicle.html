Braking device for a rail vehicle<br>
The invention relates to a braking device for a rail vehicle,<br>
wherein a brake control unit is connected to brake units via a<br>
data bus system.<br>
A braking device is provided in every rail vehicle. Said<br>
braking device is triggered either by the driver of the vehicle<br>
who activates a switch or a valve, or by a safety device. For<br>
use under particularly hazardous conditions, for example when<br>
there is a fire, a quick-acting braking device is provided in a<br>
rail vehicle. Known quick-acting braking devices are always<br>
configured in such a way that the rail vehicle is braked<br>
immediately to a standstill and that it is difficult to release<br>
the brake during the braking process or else in the stationary<br>
state. The intention is to make the rail vehicle particularly<br>
safe.<br>
A quick-acting braking device has previously been implemented<br>
by, for example in the case of a compressed air brake,<br>
completely venting the main air line. This venting activates<br>
the brake units and achieves the maximum braking force.<br>
According to another known example of a quick acting braking<br>
device, an electrical loop into which all the brake units are<br>
connected is installed through a train. If the voltage at the<br>
brake units drops due to an interruption in the electrical<br>
loop, these brake units close with maximum braking force.<br>
DE 101 28 897 Cl discloses a braking device in which a data bus<br>
system" connects a brake control unit and braking units.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/050929	- 2 -<br>
2005P00020WOUS	<br>
With such a braking device it was previously not possible to<br>
bring about the maximum braking force at short notice when<br>
there was a defect in the brake system.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a braking<br>
device which is quick acting through use of a data bus system<br>
and nevertheless makes it possible for the maximum braking<br>
force to be available quickly in the event of a defect in the<br>
brake system.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by virtue of<br>
the fact that the data bus system is used to transmit telegrams<br>
and that the data bus system is assigned a fail-safe device in<br>
order to detect transmission errors, which fail-safe device is<br>
connected at the output end to brake units of the service brake<br>
and of the emergency brake, in order to trigger brake units if<br>
a transmission error occurs.<br>
This provides the advantage that the brake units are actuated<br>
directly by means of signals which are generally digital<br>
signals. These are less susceptible to faults than variables<br>
such as, for example, the air pressure in a line or the<br>
electrical voltage, which were previously used to actuate the<br>
brake units. Nevertheless it is ensured that the maximum<br>
braking force is achieved immediately in the event of a defect<br>
in the brake system.<br>
For example, a device for detecting the time period between the<br>
outputting of a telegram and its arrival via the data bus<br>
system is provided, which device is connected to a threshold<br>
value transmitter and a control device, in order to trigger the<br>
brake units if the time period is longer than the threshold<br>
value of the threshold value transmitter.<br>
The advantage is achieved that a defect in the brake system can<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/050929         - 2a -<br>
2005P00020WOUS	<br>
easily  be  perceived  solely  through  the  detection  of  an<br>
excessively long time period.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/050929	- 3 -<br>
2005P00020WOUS	<br>
For example, the brake units have modules for checking the<br>
telegrams which have arrived. It is therefore possible to<br>
transmit messages with the telegrams.<br>
For example, the telegrams each contain an indication of the<br>
outputting brake control unit. Therefore, in the case of a<br>
motive power unit with two driver's cabs it is possible to<br>
detect which driver's cab is activated at a particular time.<br>
Telegrams which then appear to originate from the driver's cab<br>
which is not activated can be disregarded.<br>
For example, a brake control unit, which is assigned a switch<br>
for the purpose of activation, is arranged in the driver's cab.<br>
This makes it possible, in the particularly simple way, for the<br>
driver of the vehicle to be able to switch off the brake<br>
control unit, and thus the entire quick-acting brake device if<br>
necessary. This is particularly appropriate if the train would<br>
otherwise come to a standstill in a tunnel, which would be<br>
hazardous, for example, in the event of a fire in the train.<br>
For example, the data bus system is connected via a first<br>
gateway to a train bus which is connected via a second gateway<br>
to a data bus system of another, coupled rail vehicle. The use<br>
of this train bus makes it possible to connect to one another a<br>
plurality of complete motive power units which, for example,<br>
each have two driver's cabs, in which case all the brake units<br>
are operated from one driver's cab.<br>
For example, the telegrams which arrive via the train bus<br>
contain an indication of the first gateway which is assigned to<br>
the outputting brake control unit. This indirectly ensures that<br>
in the coupled train only those telegrams which come from the<br>
driver's cab of the other train are considered. Faults are thus<br>
largely avoided.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/050929	- 4 -<br>
2005P00020WOUS<br>
In order to improve the reliability, the telegrams can, for<br>
example, be transmitted redundantly.<br>
The at least one brake control unit is, for example, part of a<br>
train protection device. This train protection device permits<br>
driverless operation and ensures that the brake control unit is<br>
incorporated for automated braking with all the previously<br>
known advantages.<br>
For example, the brake units have their own voltage supplies.<br>
As a result, a power supply line which would have to be routed<br>
through the entire rail vehicle is advantageously not required.<br>
In fact, it is possible for no power supply to be provided via<br>
the data bus system.<br>
For example, the brake units have sensors for the brake<br>
pressure, which sensors are connected to the at least one brake<br>
control unit. This provides the advantage that the driver of<br>
the vehicle can be informed of a reduced brake pressure.<br>
For example, the at least one brake control unit has an input<br>
interface for signals. It is therefore advantageously possible<br>
for this brake control unit also to be switched automatically<br>
without a driver of a vehicle intervening.<br>
For example, an emergency travel mode switch for bypassing<br>
braking commands is connected to the input interface.<br>
Activation of the emergency travel mode switch, for example by<br>
the driver of the vehicle, causes all the previous commands to<br>
be cancelled so that a rail vehicle can still leave a hazardous<br>
point before it stops. Such a hazardous point may be a tunnel.<br>
For example, two emergency travel mode switches on which an AND<br>
logic operation has been carried out are provided.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/050929	- 5 -<br>
2005P0002pwOUS	<br>
For example, an OR logic operation is carried out on signals<br>
for braking and an AND logic operation is carried out on<br>
signals for the emergency travel mode, at the input interface.<br>
This provides the advantage that emergency braking can be<br>
triggered very quickly by a single signal while interruption in<br>
the emergency braking is possible only if a plurality of<br>
signals on which an AND logic operation has been carried out<br>
require the brake to be released. Consequently, undesired<br>
interruption of the emergency braking is ruled out.<br>
For the driverless operating mode, for example a sensor system<br>
for monitoring the track region is connected to the input<br>
interface. Such a sensor system, which may be, for example, an<br>
image-recording camera, reliably ensures undisrupted driverless<br>
operation since obstacles in the track region can be detected<br>
in such good time that the rail vehicle can stop before the<br>
obstacle.<br>
For example, the at least one brake control unit is part of a<br>
control center which is connected to its input interface and to<br>
the data bus system in a wireless fashion. This makes central<br>
evaluation of the braking processes possible even outside the<br>
rail vehicle.<br>
The braking device according to the invention provides, in<br>
particular, the advantage that the brake units can be activated<br>
quickly and reliably, and rapid braking is possible even when<br>
there is a defect in the brake system. Furthermore, when<br>
necessary it is also possible to interrupt the braking process<br>
at short notice so that the rail vehicle does not stop in a<br>
tunnel.<br><br>
