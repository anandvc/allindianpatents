				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A METHOD OF FABRICATING A LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a light emitting device and a<br>
method of fabricating the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There have long been demands for high-luminance, light<br>
emitting device capable of causing short-wavelength emission in<br>
the blue light region. Such light emitting device has recently<br>
been realized by using AIGalnN-base materials. Rapid progress<br>
has also been made in applying the device to full-color, light<br>
emitting apparatuses or to display apparatuses by combining it<br>
with red and green high-luminance, light emitting devices. Use<br>
of the AIGalnN-base material, however, inevitably raises the<br>
costs because the material contains Ga and In as major<br>
components, both of which are relatively rare metals. One of<br>
other major problems of the material is that the growth<br>
temperature thereof is as high as 700 to 1,000Â°C, and thus<br>
consumes a considerably large amount of energy for the<br>
production. This is undesirable not only in terms of cost<br>
reduction, but also in terms of being against the stream of the<br>
times where discussions on energy saving and suppression of<br>
global warming are prevailing. Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Publication No. 2001-44500 proposes a light emitting device<br>
having a more inexpensive ZnO-base compound semiconductor<br>
layer heteroepitaxially grown on a sapphire substrate. Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11-168262 discloses a two-<br>
dimensional-array planar light emitting device using a light<br>
emitting layer portion composed of oxides of Zn and Mg, or alloy<br>
thereof.<br>
In addition, an InAIAsP/lnGaAsP compound semiconductor<br>
laser typically for use in transponders for submarine optical fiber<br>
cables, of which specifications such as crystal defect density or<br>
the like are very strictly regulated in order to realize a high<br>
output and an high durability.<br>
In all of these devices, semiconductor layers composing the<br>
light emitting layer portion are formed by a vapor-phase epitaxy<br>
process such as sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or<br>
metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE).<br>
There is a problem that oxide layers of Zn and Mg are very<br>
likely io cause oxygen deficiency, and they inevitably tend to<br>
have an n-type conductivity, so that it is intrinsically difficult to<br>
obtain the crystal having only a less amount of n-type carrier<br>
(electrons) as a conductive carrier. Nevertheless, in the<br>
fabrication of the electronic devices disclosed in the above-<br>
described patent publications, it is essentially necessary to form<br>
oxide layers of Zn and Mg having a p-type conductivity. These<br>
oxide crystals, however, tend to have an n-type conductivity due<br>
to oxygen deficiency as described in the above, and it has long<br>
been believed as very difficult to form the p-type crystal or non-<br>
doped, semi-insulating crystal used for the active layer. One<br>
possible method may be such as adding p-type dopant, but<br>
conversion of an n-type conductivity of a material into a p-type<br>
conductivity needs a large amount of dopants in order to<br>
compensate the whole portion of the existing n-type carriers and<br>
to excessively generate p-type carriers, so that problems in<br>
stability, reproducibility and uniformity of the electric<br>
characteristics remain unsolved.<br>
Even for the case where the light emitting device is to be<br>
fabricated by a vapor-phase epitaxy process using any compound<br>
semiconductors other than the oxides of Zn and Mg (referred to<br>
as ZnO-base oxide or MgZnO-base oxide, hereinafter), only a<br>
tiny crystal defect ascribabie to variation in reaction efficiency of<br>
the source gases may cause failure especially in the<br>
aforementioned InAIAsP/lnGaAsP compound semiconductor laser,<br>
for which a very high level of quality is required, and may<br>
considerably lower the production yield.<br>
ZnO-base oxide can be obtained by a vapor-phase epitaxy<br>
in a vacuum environment, where heteroepitaxial growth process<br>
using a substrate of a different origin, such as sapphire, is<br>
unconditionally adopted because of difficulty in bulk single<br>
crystal growth. It is therefore necessary to interpose an<br>
appropriate buffer layer between the substrate and the light<br>
emitting layer portion in order to attain a desirable crystallinity of<br>
the light emitting layer portion as described in the above. The<br>
aforementioned Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.<br>
2001-44500 discloses a method in which the buffer layer (contact<br>
layer) is formed by MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) process or<br>
MOVPE (Metalorganic Vapour Phase Epitaxy) process similarly to<br>
the light emitting layer to be formed in succession.<br>
The MBE process, however, cannot readily suppress<br>
generation of the oxygen deficiency due to its low pressure in the<br>
growth atmosphere, so that it is very difficult for the process to<br>
form the ZnO-base oxide layer which is indispensable for<br>
composing the light emitting device. On the other hand, the<br>
MOVPE process can arbitrarily vary partial pressure of oxygen<br>
during the growth, and thus can suppress generation of the<br>
oxygen elimination or oxygen deficiency by raising the<br>
atmospheric pressure to some extent. In the MOVPE process<br>
generally proceeded in a continuous manner, even if any<br>
accidental irregularity such as deficiency or dislocation of the<br>
atoms should occur, the layer growth for the next layer and<br>
thereafter continuously proceed while leaving the irregularity<br>
unrepaired, so that the process could not always ensure a<br>
desirable quality of the buffer layer which governs the crystal<br>
quality of the light emitting layer portion, and this has<br>
consequently been making it difficult to obtain the device having<br>
an excellent light emission efficiency.<br>
The aforementioned ZnO-base oxide will have a larger band<br>
gap energy as alloy composition x of MgO (magnesium oxide) to<br>
ZnO (zinc oxide) increases. For the case where the ZnO-base<br>
semiconductor light emitting device, which comprises an MgZnO-<br>
type oxide, is configured based on the double heterostructure, it<br>
is therefore a general practice to compose the active layer with<br>
ZnO in view of ensuring more effective confinement of carriers<br>
injected thereto. The MgZnO-type oxide can be formed by the<br>
MOVPE process or MBE process as described in the above, but<br>
the formation process thereof is highly causative of oxygen<br>
deficiency of the MgZnO-type oxide and can readily result in<br>
degradation of crystallinity of the active layer composed of ZnO.<br>
This consequently expands total half value width of the emission<br>
wavelength range ascribable to the active layer, reduces the<br>
emission intensity, and suppresses the emission efficiency for<br>
specific wavelength to be desired.<br>
A first subject of the invention is, therefore, to provide a<br>
method of fabricating a light emitting device having a ZnO-base<br>
oxide layer, capable of growing the p-type oxide layer in a<br>
reproducible and stable manner.<br>
A second subject of the invention is to provide a method of<br>
fabricating a light emitting device capable of drastically raising<br>
reaction efficiency of the source gases when the semiconductor<br>
layer composing the light emitting layer portion is formed by a<br>
vapor-phase epitaxy process, and of readily realizing<br>
semiconductor layers having a conductivity type which have not<br>
conventionally been obtainable, and having only a less amount of<br>
crystal defects and being high in quality.<br>
A third subject of the invention is to provide a method of<br>
fabricating a light emitting device capable of realizing a high-<br>
quality, light emitting layer portion composed of a ZnO-base<br>
oxide, and to provide also a light emitting device obtainable by<br>
the method.<br>
A fourth subject of the invention is to provide a light<br>
emitting device using a ZnO-base oxide, of which active layer<br>
can be formed with a high quality in an exact manner, and is<br>
further to provide a high-performance, blue-color light emitting<br>
device at low costs.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
(First Invention)<br>
A first invention is to solve the aforementioned first subject,<br>
and is to provide a method of fabricating a light emitting device<br>
having a light emitting layer portion which includes a p-type<br>
MgxZn1-xO (where, 0=x=1) layer, wherein the p-type MgxZn1-xO<br>
layer is grown by a metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy process<br>
while supplying organometallic gases, an oxygen component<br>
source gas and a p-type dopant gas into a reaction vessel, and is,<br>
annealed during and/or after completion of the growth thereof in<br>
an oxygen-containing atmosphere.<br>
In the first invention, the p-type MgxZn1-xO layer grown by a<br>
metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy process is annealed in the<br>
oxygen-containing atmosphere during and/or after completion of<br>
the growth. This effectively prevents the oxygen deficiency from<br>
occurring, and successfully obtains a crystal having a less<br>
amount of n-type carrier. It is therefore no more necessary to<br>
add an excessive amount of p-type dopant for compensating the<br>
n-type carrier, and this makes it possible to obtain the light<br>
emitting device containing the p-type MgxZn1-xO layer, excellent<br>
in the stability, reproducibility and uniformity in the electrical<br>
characteristics.<br>
In order to obtain a high-luminance, light emitting device, it<br>
is effective to compose the light emitting layer portion so as to<br>
have a double heterostructure as described in the next. That is,<br>
the light emitting layer portion is configured so as to have a<br>
structure in which an n-type cladding layer, an active layer, and a<br>
p-type MgxZn1-xO (where, 0 =x=1) layer are stacked in this<br>
order. The method of fabricating a light emitting device<br>
according to the first invention herein characteristically<br>
comprises:<br>
an n-type cladding layer growing step for growing the n-<br>
type cladding layer; and<br>
an active layer growing step for growing the active layer;<br>
and<br>
a p-type cladding layer growing step for growing the p-type<br>
cladding layer by a metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy process<br>
while supplying organometallic gases, an oxygen component<br>
source gas and a p-type dopant gas into a reaction vessel, and<br>
annealing the p-type cladding layer during and/or after<br>
completion of the growth thereof in an oxygen-containing<br>
atmosphere. This method is successful in realizing, a device<br>
showing high emission intensity specific to the double<br>
heterostructure.<br>
The light emitting layer portion can be configured so that<br>
the n-type cladding layer composed of an n-type MgzZn1-xO<br>
(where, 0=z=1) layer, the active layer composed of a MgyZn1-yO<br>
(where, 0 ^ yy) layer, and the p-type cladding layer<br>
composed of a p-type MgxZn1-xO (where, 0=x=1) layer are<br>
stacked in this order. In the n-type cladding layer formation step<br>
herein, organometallic gases and an oxygen component source<br>
gas are supplied into the reaction vessel so as to allow the n-<br>
type cladding layer to grow on the substrate based on a meta!<br>
organic vapor-phase epitaxy process. The active layer growing<br>
step herein is a step for growing the active layer on a substrate<br>
by a metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy process while supplying<br>
organometallic gases and an oxygen component source gas into<br>
the reaction vessel, and includes a step for annealing the layer<br>
during and/or after completion of the growth thereof in an<br>
oxygen-containing atmosphere.<br>
In the above-described method in which the active layer<br>
composed of the MgyZn1-yO layer and the p-type cladding layer<br>
composed of the p-type MgxZn1-xO layer are formed by a metal<br>
organic vapor-phase epitaxy process, the annealing carried out<br>
during and/or after completion of the growth of these layers can<br>
effectively prevent the oxygen deficiency from occurring within<br>
the layers, and is successful in readily obtaining the crystal<br>
having only a less amount of n-type carrier. It is therefore no<br>
more necessary for the p-type cladding layer to be added with an<br>
excessive amount of p-type dopant for compensating the n-type<br>
carrier, and it is made possible for the active layer to suppress<br>
the carrier concentration and to raise the emission recombination<br>
efficiency. This is also advantageous in that it can largely<br>
reduce the costs, because all layers composing the light emitting<br>
layer portion can be composed using the inexpensive MgZnO-<br>
base oxide material. On the other hand, the growth process for<br>
the n-type cladding layer does not adopt the aforementioned<br>
annealing to thereby intentionally produce the oxygen deficiency<br>
(note that a composite oxide obtained by partially replacing Zn in<br>
ZnO with Mg is occasionally abbreviated as MgZnO in the<br>
description below, this by no means indicates a condition of<br>
Mg:Zn:O = 1:1:1, where the same will apply also to the second to<br>
fourth inventions).<br>
It is now preferable to suppress the oxygen deficiency<br>
concentration in the p-type MgZnO layer or MgZnO active layer<br>
to as low as 10 sites/cm3 or below (0 site/cm3 not precluded). In<br>
this case, it is very difficult for RF sputtering and molecular beam<br>
epitaxy (MBE) to suppress generation of the oxygen deficiency,<br>
since pressure in the growth atmosphere in these processes are<br>
as low as 10"4 Torr to 10"2 Torr (1.3332X 10-2 Pa to 1.3332 Pa),<br>
so that it is substantially impossible for these methods to grow<br>
the p-type MgZnO layer. On the contrary, a vapor-phase epitaxy<br>
process based on the MOVPE process can arbitrarily vary oxygen<br>
partial pressure during the growth, and thus can suppress<br>
generation of the oxygen elimination or oxygen deficiency by<br>
raising the atmospheric pressure to some extent.<br>
When the annealing for suppressing generation of oxygen<br>
deficiency is carried out, it is preferable to reduce as possible<br>
the amount of supply of the organometallic gases than the<br>
amount of supply adopted for the case where the layer growth is<br>
a matter of preference, and it is more preferable to interrupt the<br>
supply, in view of suppressing generation of the oxygen<br>
deficiency in the layers. The oxygen-containing atmosphere<br>
during the annealing can be created by introducing the oxygen<br>
component source gas (same as that used for the layer growth<br>
based on the MOVPE process) into the reaction vessel, which is<br>
efficient because the annealing can be completed within the<br>
same reaction vessels used for the layer growth.<br>
The annealing may be carried out after completion of the<br>
layer growth, but it may be difficult for the annealing after the<br>
completion to fully remove the oxygen deficiency which remains<br>
deep inside the layer if the oxygen deficiency is accidentally<br>
formed in the process of the layer growth. It is therefore<br>
effective to carry out the annealing during the layer growth, and<br>
more preferably to alternatively repeat the intermittent layer<br>
growth and the annealing in the oxygen-containing atmosphere<br>
for the purpose of more effective suppression of the oxygen<br>
deficiency. In this case, the aforementioned repetition of the<br>
intermittent layer growth and annealing will be more efficient if<br>
the layer to be annealed is grown while continuously supplying<br>
the oxygen component source gas and intermittently interrupting<br>
supply of the organometallic gases, to thereby make use of the<br>
time duration of interrupted supply of the organometallic gases<br>
as an effective duration of the annealing.<br>
Next, the annealing for suppressing the oxygen deficiency<br>
for the p-type MgZnO layer or the MgZnO active layer must be<br>
carried out in the oxygen-containing atmosphere having an<br>
oxygen partial pressure higher than dissociation oxygen pressure<br>
of MgZnO (where, oxygen-containing molecules other than O2 are<br>
to be included after converting the component oxygen into O2).<br>
In an atmosphere having an oxygen partial pressure lower than<br>
the dissociation oxygen pressure of MgZnO, it is impossible to<br>
prevent the oxygen deficiency from occurring due to promoted<br>
decomposition of MgZnO. The oxygen partial pressure adaptable<br>
to the annealing is more preferably 1 Torr (133.32 Pa) or above<br>
While there is no special limitations on the upper limit of the<br>
oxygen partial pressure, the pressure is preferably set within a<br>
range not causative of unnecessary rise in costs of the annealing<br>
facility (typically set at 7,600 (1.013 MPa) Torr or around for the<br>
annealing in the reaction vessel).<br>
(Second Invention)<br>
A second invention is to solve the aforementioned second<br>
subject, and is to provide a method of fabricating a light emitting<br>
device having a step of growing a semiconductor layer for<br>
composing a light emitting layer portion in vapor phase by<br>
introducing source gases in a reaction vessel having a substrate<br>
disposed therein, and by allowing a semiconductor material<br>
generated based on chemical reactions of the source gases to<br>
deposit on the main surface of the substrate, wherein a vapor-<br>
phase epitaxy process of the semiconductor layer is proceeded<br>
while irradiating ultraviolet light to the source gases introduced<br>
in the reaction vessel.<br>
Because the chemical reactions for producing the<br>
semiconductor material from the source gases is promoted by<br>
ultraviolet irradiation in the second invention, the semiconductor<br>
material will be less causative of crystal defects or the like<br>
during deposition on the main surface of the substrate, and will<br>
readily realize the semiconductor layer having only a less amount<br>
of crystal defects.<br>
In the production of the semiconductor material through the<br>
chemical reactions of the source gases, a reaction system<br>
containing the source gases needs be transferred into a reactive<br>
transition state having a high enthalpy. If the amount of energy<br>
required for causing transfer to the transition status is not<br>
supplied, unreacted or incompletely-reacted components of the<br>
source gases will increase components causing adsorption within<br>
the layer and will be causative of the crystal defects. Although<br>
the necessary energy might be supplemented by heat energy,<br>
this requires rise in the temperature of the system. An<br>
excessive rise in the temperature of the substrate however ruin<br>
adsorption ratio of the semiconductor material contributable to<br>
the crystal growth, and undesirably results in formation of the<br>
layers only having a large amount of crystal defects. In contrast,<br>
combined use of the ultraviolet irradiation described in the above<br>
is successful in securing a necessary and enough energy for<br>
completing the generation reactions of the semiconductor<br>
material without excessively raising the temperature of the<br>
system, and in forming the semiconductor layer having only a<br>
less amount of crystal defects.<br>
in this case, one possible system is such as having a<br>
ultraviolet light source disposed so as to oppose with the main<br>
surface of the substrate, in which the source gases are supplied<br>
between the substrate and the ultraviolet light source while<br>
irradiating ultraviolet light towards the main surface. This is<br>
successful in selectively accelerating the generation reactions of<br>
the semiconductor material from the source gases in the vicinity<br>
of the main surface of the substrate. Ultraviolet light irradiated<br>
to the substrate is once absorbed by the substrate, and can<br>
highly activate the outermost portion of the layers under growth<br>
based on the light excitation effect. More specifically, it is<br>
supposed that a highly activated status similar to that obtainable<br>
by the layer growth under a high temperature is locally realized<br>
in the outermost portion of the layers, and this makes it possible<br>
to efficiently proceed the layer growth while suppressing thermal<br>
decomposition of the source gas components in the vapor phase.<br>
In one rational method of irradiating ultraviolet light to the<br>
source gases or the substrate in the reaction vessel, a part of the<br>
wall portion of the reaction vessel opposing to the main surface<br>
of the substrate is configured as a transparent wall portion, the<br>
ultraviolet light source is disposed outside the reaction vessel,<br>
and ultraviolet light from the ultraviolet light source is irradiated<br>
towards the main surface through the transparent wall portion.<br>
According to this configuration, the ultraviolet light source can be<br>
disposed outside the reaction vessel, and this prevents the light<br>
source per se from being adversely affected by corrosion or<br>
deposited reaction products, and elongates the service life of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Although any vapor-phase epitaxy processes may be<br>
applicable so far as they can correlate the chemical reactions to<br>
tne layer growth, a metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)<br>
process is particularly preferable because of its potential of<br>
efficiently growing a high-quality oxide semiconductor or<br>
compound semiconductor. While the MBE process is one<br>
possible method other than the MOVPE process, the MOVPE<br>
process can more advantageously be adopted to the formation of<br>
the oxide semiconductor layer described below because it is<br>
more unlikely cause the oxygen deficiency.<br>
In a metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy process, the<br>
semiconductor layer composed of the metal oxide can be formed<br>
by using organometallic gases and an oxygen component source<br>
gas as the source gases, based on chemical reactions of the<br>
organometallic gases with the oxygen component source gas. In<br>
the formation of the oxide semiconductor, any unreacted or<br>
incompletely-reacted oxygen component source gas incorporated<br>
into the layer by adhesion will be causative of the oxygen<br>
deficiency after elimination of the component. The oxygen<br>
deficiency emits an electron as a carrier, and thus inevitably<br>
makes the conductivity type of the resultant layer n-type. This is<br>
a serious non-conformity in formation of p-type layer or insulating<br>
(non-doped) layer indispensable for forming the light emitting<br>
layer portion. Adoption of the second invention herein is<br>
successful in effectively suppressing generation of the oxygen<br>
deficiency. The oxide semiconductor layer thus formed is<br>
exemplified by MgxZn1-xO (where, 0 = x = 1) layer. Use of the<br>
MgxZn1-xO layer makes it possible to readily form a light emitting<br>
device capable of ensuring high luminance light emission in the<br>
blue light region or ultraviolet region.<br>
Adoption of the second invention is successful in effectively<br>
suppressing the oxygen deficiency, and is consequently<br>
successful in readily obtaining the crystal having only a less<br>
amount of n-type carrier. It is therefore no more necessary to<br>
add an excessive amount of p-type dopant for compensating the<br>
n-type carrier, and this makes it possible to obtain the light<br>
emitting device containing the p-type MgxZn1-xO layer, excellent<br>
in the stability, reproducibility and uniformity in the electrical<br>
characteristics.<br>
More specifically, the light emitting layer portion can be<br>
configured so as to have a double heterostructure in which the n-<br>
type cladding layer composed of an n-type MgzZn1-zO (where,0=<br>
z=1) layer, the active layer coimposed of a MgyZn1-yO (where, 0<br>
=yy) layer, and the p-type cladding layer composed of a p-<br>
type MgxZn1-xO (where, 0=x=1) layer are stacked in this order.<br>
In this case, the n-type cladding layer can readily be formed by<br>
supplying the organometallic gases and an oxygen component<br>
source gas into the reaction vessel, without specifically<br>
irradiating ultraviolet light. The active layer can be formed by<br>
supplying the organometallic gasses and an oxygen component<br>
source gas into the reaction vessel with irradiating ultraviolet<br>
light. The p-type cladding layer can be formed by additionally<br>
supplying a p-type dopant gas in the process similar to that for<br>
the active layer.<br>
Also in the second invention, it is preferable to suppress<br>
the oxygen deficiency concentration in the p-type MgZnO layer or<br>
MgZnO active layer to as low as 10 sites/cm3 or below (0<br>
site/cm3 not precluded), and a vapor-phase epitaxy process<br>
based on the MOVPE process is preferable in view of<br>
suppressing the oxygen deficiency. ,,<br>
The second invention is also applicable to fabrication of<br>
compound semiconductor light emitting devices other than those<br>
using the MgZnO-base oxide, such as InAIAsP/lnGaAsP<br>
compound semiconductor light emitting device (laser device, in<br>
particular).<br>
(Third Invention)<br>
A third invention is to solve the aforementioned third<br>
subject, and includes a method of fabricating a light emitting<br>
device and thus-fabricated, light emitting device. The method of<br>
fabricating a light emitting device of the third invention is such as<br>
fabricating a light emitting device having a light emitting layer<br>
portion composed of an MgaZn1-aO-type (where, 0=a=1) oxide,<br>
wherein a buffer layer is formed on a substrate, the buffer layer<br>
having at least an MgaZn1-aO-type oxide layer on the contact side<br>
with the light emitting layer portion, and the light emitting layer<br>
18<br>
portion is grown on the buffer layer;<br>
the MgaZn1-agO-type. oxide layer has wurtzite crystal<br>
structure in which metal atom layers and oxygen atom layers are<br>
alternatively stacked in the direction of the c-axis, the buffer<br>
layer is grown so as to orient the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal<br>
structure to the thickness-wise direction, and so as to form a<br>
metal atom layer as a metal monoatomic layer on the substrate<br>
by the atomic layer epitaxy, and then to form the residual oxygen<br>
atom layers and metal atom layers.<br>
The light emitting device of the third invention is such as<br>
having a light emitting layer portion composed of an MgaZn1-aO-<br>
type (where, O=a=1) oxide and formed on a substrate, and<br>
having a buffer layer formed between the substrate and the light<br>
emitting layer portion, the buffer layer having at least an MgaZn1-<br>
aO-type oxide layer on the contact side with the light emitting<br>
layer portion;<br>
the MgaZn1-aO-type oxide layer has wurtzite crystal<br>
structure in which metal atom layers and oxygen atom layers are<br>
alternatively stacked in the direction of the c-axis; and<br>
the buffer layer has the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal<br>
structure oriented to the thickness-wise direction, has a single<br>
atom layer portion as a metal monoatomic layer formed in contact<br>
with the substrate, and has the residual oxygen atom layers and<br>
metal atom layers alternatively stacked successive to the metal<br>
monoatomic layer.<br>
In the third invention, the entire portion or at least a portion<br>
on the contact side with the light emitting layer portion of the<br>
buffer layer formed on the substrate is composed of an MgaZn1-<br>
aO-type oxide (where, alloy composition a is not always same<br>
with that of the light emitting layer portion, and the oxide may<br>
occasionally be referred to as MgZnO-type oxide or simply as<br>
MgZnO, while omitting indication of the alloy composition a).<br>
Because the portion on the junction interface side of the buffer<br>
layer and the light emitting layer portion have basically the same<br>
crystal structure (wurtzite crystal structure) and the same<br>
component system, local irregularity of the crystal structure due<br>
to interaction between the components over the junction interface<br>
becomes less likely to occur, and this is advantageous in<br>
realizing the light emitting layer portion having a desirable<br>
crystal Iinity. Typically the entire portion of the buffer layer may<br>
be composed of the MgZnO-type oxide. This makes it possible to<br>
carry out a vapor-phase epitaxy process of the buffer layer and<br>
light emitting layer portion in the same facility in an extremely<br>
simple manner.<br>
In the third invention, the buffer layer is formed particularly<br>
so as to form a metal atom layer as a metal monoatomic layer on<br>
the substrate by the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) process, and<br>
then to form the residual oxygen atom layers and metal atom<br>
layers. By adopting the ALE process, formation of the metal<br>
atom layer can be saturated once a single atomic layer is<br>
completed (so-called, self-termination function), and the atoms<br>
arranged in the layer are less likely to cause any irregularity<br>
such as deficiency or dislocation. By forming a single layer of<br>
the less-irregular metal atom layer and then forming the<br>
succeeaing metal atomic layers and oxygen atom layers, it is<br>
made possible to obtain the buffer layer having an excellent<br>
crystallinity. This consequently improves the crystallinity of the<br>
light emitting layer portion formed thereon, and is advantageous<br>
in realizing a high-performance, light emitting device. By<br>
adopting the above-described method, the light emitting device of<br>
the third invention will have the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal<br>
structure oriented to the thickness-wise direction, will have the<br>
single atom layer portion in contact with the substrate formed as<br>
a metal monoatomic layer, and will have the residual oxygen<br>
atom layers and metal atom layers alternatively formed in<br>
succession to the metal monoatomic layer. Thus-configured<br>
buffer layer has an excellent crystallinity, and this makes it<br>
possible to realize the light emitting layer portion having only a<br>
less amount of defects and irregularity, and having a desirable<br>
emission efficiency.<br>
The ALE process can be carried out in a form of a metal<br>
organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) process in which an<br>
organometallic compound gas and an oxygen component source<br>
gas are supplied in a reaction vessel having a substrate disposed<br>
therein. More specifically, only an organometallic compound gas,<br>
which serves as a source material for the metal atom layer, is<br>
allowed to flow through the reaction vessel to thereby form the<br>
first metal atom layer for composing the buffer layer so as to be<br>
saturated by a single atom layer, to thereby form a metal<br>
monoatomic layer. As shown in Fig. 16A, organometallic<br>
compound (MO) molecule causes decomposition or elimination of<br>
organic groups bound thereto, and allows its metal atom to<br>
chemically adsorb onto the substrate. Under the ALE process,<br>
the metal atom is adsorbed while keeping a part of its organic<br>
groups unremoved, and as shown in Fig. 16B, forms the metal<br>
atom layer so as to orient the residual organic group towards the<br>
upper surface. Once the first single atomic layer is completed,<br>
thus-oriented organic groups can inhibit adhesion of newly-<br>
coming metal atoms and can fully exhibit the self-termination<br>
function, so that the atoms arranged in the layer will become very<br>
unlikely to cause irregularities such as deficiency and dislocation.<br>
In the MOVPE process, oxygen partial pressure during the<br>
growth can arbitrarily be varied, so that generation of the oxygen<br>
elimination or oxygen deficiency is effectively avoidable by<br>
raising the atmospheric pressure to some extent. This<br>
consequently makes it possible to form the p-type MgaZn1-aO<br>
layer indispensable for the light emitting device, in particular the<br>
p-type MgaZn1-aO layer such as having a density of oxygen<br>
deficiency of as small as 10 sites/cm3 or below. The smaller<br>
density of oxygen deficiency is the better (that is, 0 site/cm3 not<br>
precluded).<br>
When the MOVPE process is adopted, composition of the<br>
entire portion of the buffer layer using MgZnO-type oxide is<br>
advantageous, because the buffer layer and light emitting layer<br>
portion can be grown sequentially in the same reaction vessel<br>
only by adjusting ratio of the organometailic gasses and oxygen<br>
component source gas. This is also advantageous in that the<br>
purging of the vessel between growth processes for the buffer<br>
layer and light emitting layer portion needs only a short time as<br>
compared with the case where the buffer layer is formed using<br>
different materials such as GaN, or the purging per se is<br>
omissible.<br>
Also in the third invention, it is effective to grow the light<br>
emitting layer portion so as to have a double heterostructure as<br>
described below, in order to obtain a high-luminance, light<br>
emitting device. That is, the double heterostructured, light<br>
emitting layer portion is formed on the buffer layer by<br>
sequentially stacking a first-conductivity-type cladding layer (p-<br>
type or n-type) composed of MgaZn1-aaO-type oxide, an active<br>
layer, and a second-conductivity-type cladding layer (n-type or p-<br>
type) having a conductivity type different from that of the first-<br>
conductivity-type cladding layer, in this order.<br>
(Fourth Invention)<br>
A fourth invention is to provide a light emitting device for<br>
solving the fourth subject. The light emitting device has a double<br>
heterostructured, light emitting layer portion which comprises an<br>
active layer and cladding layers, wherein the active layer is<br>
composed of a Group II-VI compound semiconductor containing<br>
Zn as a Group II element, and containing O together with Se or<br>
Te as a Group VI element, and the cladding layers are composed<br>
of MgxZn1-xO-type (where, 0=x=1) oxide.<br>
In the double hetero-type, ZnO-base semiconductor light<br>
emitting devices composed of an MgZnO-base oxide, those<br>
having the active layer composed of ZnO, having a band gap<br>
energy of 3.25 eV, causes light emission in near violet color. To<br>
adjust the band gap energy suitable for blue-color light emission,<br>
it is necessary to add some impurity to the ZnO active layer to<br>
thereby form impurity levels, or to configure the active layer<br>
using a ZnO-base alloyed compound semiconductor having a<br>
smaller band gap energy than ZnO has.<br>
To achieve blue-color light emission with high emission<br>
efficiency, it is necessary for the active layer to satisfy the<br>
above-described constitutional conditions, and to stabilize the<br>
crystallinity. In view of stabilizing the crystallinity of the active<br>
layer composed of a ZnO-base semiconductor mainly containing<br>
ZnO, an essential point resides in that how successfully the<br>
oxygen deficiency can be suppressed when the active layer is<br>
stacked by epitaxially growing the ZnO-base semiconductor<br>
typically based on the MOVPE or MBE process.<br>
The active layer in the fourth invention is formed using<br>
Group II-VI compound semiconductor (aforementioned ZnO-base<br>
semiconductor) containing Zn (zinc) as a Group II element, and<br>
containing O (oxygen) together with Se (selenium) or Te<br>
(tellurium) as a Group VI element, and this makes it possible to<br>
introduce Se or Te, which belongs to the same Group with oxygen,<br>
into the oxygen-deficient sites. For the case where the<br>
introduced Se or Te acts as an impurity, Zn-Se pair or Zn-Te pair<br>
is supposed to form a deeper impurity level than ZnO forms, so<br>
that blue-color light emission with a higher efficiency than that<br>
given by ZnO-base semiconductor can be obtained.<br>
In the active layer composed of ZnO-base semiconductor,<br>
Se or Te introduced into the oxygen-deficient sites may not exist<br>
in a form of impurity, but may form a local crystal structure of<br>
ZnOSe or ZnOTe which is different from ZnO. Both of the ZnOSe<br>
crystal and ZnOTe crystal have smaller band gap energies as<br>
compared with that of ZnO crystal, and can form the active layer<br>
capable of blue-color light emission at a higher efficiency. The<br>
emission possibly obtained via the impurity levels results in<br>
saturation of effect of improving the emission efficiency due to a<br>
limited range of formation of Zn-Se pair or Zn-Te pair which is<br>
causative of the impurity levels. On the other hand, the emission<br>
possibly obtained via the bands formed by the ZnOSe crystal or<br>
ZnOTe crystal results in further increase in the emission<br>
efficiency.<br>
The double heterostructure adopted for the light emitting<br>
device of the fourth invention is such as having the active layer,<br>
which is composed of the aforementioned Se- or Te-containing,<br>
ZnO-base semiconductor, sandwiched between the cladding<br>
layers which are composed of MgxZn,-xO-type (0=x=1) oxide<br>
having a band gap energy larger than that of the active layer.<br>
The MgxZn1-xO-type (0=x=1) oxide will have a larger band gap<br>
energy as MgO alloy composition x increases, but will also have<br>
a larger insulating property, increase in MgO alloy composition x,<br>
therefore, makes it difficult to dope an effective number of<br>
carriers into the cladding layer. It is in particular difficult for ZnO,<br>
having an n-type conductivity in a non-doped status, to form the<br>
p-type cladding layer which should be doped with p-type carriers.<br>
In contrast to that the active layer has been formed by using ZnO,<br>
the active layer in the fourth invention is formed by using the Se-<br>
or Te- containing, ZnO-base semiconductor having a band gap<br>
energy smaller than that of ZnO, so that it is made possible to<br>
configure the cladding layer using the MgxZn1-xO-base oxide of<br>
which ZnO or MgO alloy composition x is suppressed to a low<br>
level. This consequently makes it possible to dope an effective<br>
number of carriers into the cladding layer, to dope an effective<br>
number of carriers also into the active layer, and to improve the<br>
emission efficiency.<br>
When the active layer is composed of ZnOSe crystal or<br>
ZnOTe crystal, the ZnOSe crystal or ZnOTe crystal will have a<br>
smaller band gap energy as the ratio of Se or Te to O increases,<br>
and thus the emission wavelength becomes shorter. A band gap<br>
energy suitable for blue-color light emission falls within a range<br>
from 2.52 to 3.15 eV, where the largest band gap energy of 3.15<br>
eV suitable for blue-color light emission can be attained typically<br>
by adjusting a ratio of O and Se to 61:39 for the ZnOSe crystal,<br>
and by adjusting a ratio of O and Te to 81:19 for the ZnOTe<br>
crystal. Because ZnO has a band gap energy of 3.25 eV, the<br>
cladding layer can be formed by using ZnO without suppressing<br>
the carrier confinement effect in the active layer. By composing<br>
the cladding layer with ZnO, the cladding layer and active layer<br>
will have ZnO as a major constituent thereof, and this not only<br>
makes it possible to improve working efficiency in the fabrication,<br>
but also makes it unnecessary to use excessive Mg, and<br>
contributes to cost reduction.<br>
Beside the above-described blue-color light emission, it is<br>
also possible to obtain band gap energy suitable for emission at<br>
longer wavelength regions such as blue-green to green regions,<br>
by adjusting ratio of Se and Te to O in the ZnOSe crystal or<br>
ZnOTe crystal. Since the band gap energy of the active layer in<br>
this case is smaller than that suitable for blue-color light<br>
emission, the cladding layer can be composed by using ZnO.<br>
The active layer of the ZnO-base semiconductor light<br>
emitting device of the fourth invention can be configured as<br>
having a multi-layered structure in which sub-layers composed of<br>
ZnSe or ZnTe are inserted in a main layer composed of ZnO so<br>
as to be distributed over the thickness-wise direction.<br>
As described in the above, when the active layer is formed<br>
by epitaxially growing ZnO-base semiconductor, crystallinity of<br>
the active layer can be improved by introducing Se or Te, which<br>
belongs to the same Group with oxygen, to oxygen-deficient sites.<br>
It is also possible to shift the emission wavelength of the active<br>
layer to the longer wavelength region. While the active layer<br>
may be configured as a single layer composed of Se- or Te-<br>
containing ZnO-base semiconductor, adoption of the above-<br>
described, multi-layered structure, which is typified by a structure<br>
in which the sub-layers composed of ZnSe or ZnTe, and having a<br>
width not larger than that of a. unimolecular layer of the active<br>
layer, are inserted in a main layer composed of ZnO, ensures the<br>
effects described in the next. Thus-formed sub-layer can<br>
function as a S doped layer and can localize Se or Te in the<br>
thickness-wise direction, and this makes it possible to enhance<br>
effect of introducing Se or Te to the oxygen-deficient sites. This<br>
enhances binding tendency with Zn in the closest vicinity, and<br>
raises probability of forming Zn-Se pair or Zn-Te pair, or of<br>
forming ZnOSe crystal or ZeOTe crystal. Even if the devices are<br>
not introduced into the oxygen-deficient sites, it is made possible<br>
to prevent non-luminescent center caused by unmatched<br>
interface or dislocation, by suppressing formation of different<br>
crystal phases such as ZnSe and ZnTe. If the coverage ratio of<br>
the sub-layer is controlled so as to be smaller than a<br>
unimolecular layer of the active layer, Se or Te is successfully<br>
prevented from depositing as an impurity rather than being<br>
incorporated into the oxygen-deficient sites.<br>
Because the number of layers of the sub-layers to be<br>
inserted into the active layer can properly be selected depending<br>
on the band gap energy, and more specifically on the ratio of Se<br>
or Te to O in the ZnOSe crystal or ZnOTe crystal for composing<br>
the active layer, and is not specifically limited. It is, however,<br>
preferable of course that effect of introduction of Se or Te can<br>
uniformly extend over the active layer in view of obtaining a<br>
uniform light emission therefrom. It is therefore preferable to<br>
form the sub-layers so as to be distributed over the thickness-<br>
wise direction, and typically in a periodical manner.<br>
Other conditions commonly applicable to the first to fourth<br>
inventions will be described.<br>
The growth of the p-type MgZnO layer or MgZnO active<br>
layer based on the MOVPE process can more advantageously be<br>
proceeded under an atmosphere conditioned at a pressure of 10<br>
Torr (1.3332 kPa) or above, so as to more effectively suppress<br>
generation of the oxygen deficiency during the film formation,<br>
and to obtain the p-type MgZnO layer or MgZnO active layer<br>
having desirable characteristics. It is more preferable herein to<br>
adjust oxygen partial pressure (including any other oxygen-<br>
containing molecules other than O2, after converting component<br>
oxygen to O2) to 10 Torr (1.3332 kPa) or above. For the case<br>
where the n-type MgZnO layer is formed on the buffer layer, and<br>
further thereon the MgZnO active layer and p-type MgZnO layer<br>
is formed, any oxygen deficiencies generated in the n-type<br>
MgZnO may be causative of irregularity or the like in the MgZnO<br>
active layer and p-type MgZnO layer formed thereafter, so that it<br>
is preferable that also the n-type MgZnO layer is grown so as to<br>
suppress the oxygen deficiency as possible. In this case, the n-<br>
type MgZnO layer is added with an n-type dopant so as to have<br>
the conductivity type of n-type. On the other hand, for the case<br>
where the p-type MgZnO layer is formed on the buffer layer, and<br>
further thereon the MgZnO active layer and n-type MgZnO layer<br>
are formed, it is also allowable to intentionally form the oxygen<br>
deficiency in the n-type MgZnO layer so as to have an n-type<br>
conductivity.<br>
To make MgaZn1-aO to have a p-type conductivity, it is<br>
necessary to add an appropriate p-type dopant as described in<br>
the above. As the p-type dopant, either one of, or two or more of<br>
N, Ga, Al, in, Li, Si, C, and Se are available. Among these, use<br>
of N is particularly preferable in view of obtaining desirable p-<br>
type characteristics. As the metal element dopant, either one of,<br>
or two or more of Ga, Al, In and Li are available, where Ga is<br>
particularly effective. Combined addition of these dopants with N<br>
can ensure desirable p-type characteristics in a more reliable<br>
manner.<br>
To ensure sufficient emission characteristics, p-type carrier<br>
concentration in the p-type MggZn1-aO layer preferably falls<br>
within a range from 1 x10-6 sites/cm3 to 8x1018 sites/cm3. The p-<br>
type carrier concentration less than 1 x1 016 sites/cm3 may make it<br>
difficult to obtain a sufficient emission luminance. On the other<br>
hand, the p-type carrier concentration exceeding 8x1018 sites/cm3<br>
may excessively increase the amount of p-type carriers injected<br>
to the active layer, and this is causative of increase in p-type<br>
carrier not contributable to the light emission due to reverse<br>
diffusion into the p-type MgaZn1-aO layer, or injection into the n-<br>
type cladding layer after getting over the potential barrier, to<br>
thereby lower the emission efficiency. Also for the n-type<br>
MgaZn1-aO layer, it is preferable to adjust n-type carrier<br>
concentration within a range from 1x1016 sites/cm3 to 8x1018<br>
sites/cm3 based on the same reason.<br>
Examples of materials available for substrate include<br>
aluminum oxide, gallium oxide, magnesium oxide, gallium nitride,<br>
aluminum nitride, silicon, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide,<br>
indium-tin composite oxide and glass. Particularly preferable<br>
forms of the substrate include the followings. As shown in Fig. 2,<br>
MgaZn1-aO-type oxide has wurtzite crystal structure comprising<br>
metal atom layers and oxygen atom layers alternatively stacked<br>
in the direction of c-axis, where the oxygen atoms follow a<br>
hexagonal atomic arrangement. The substrate is, therefore,<br>
preferably an oxide single crystal substrate in which oxygen<br>
atoms follow the hexagonal atomic arrangement, and the C-plane<br>
((0001) plane) of the hexagonal atomic arrangement is exposed<br>
to the main surface, in terms of improving crystal matching with<br>
the buffer layer, and of obtaining the light emitting layer portion<br>
with a desirable crystal Unity/ In this case, the buffer layer is<br>
composed of the MgaZn1-aO-type oxide over the entire portion<br>
thereof, and is formed on the main surface of the oxide single<br>
crystal substrate so as to orient the c-axis of its wurtzite crystal<br>
structure in the thickness-wise direction. Examples of such oxide<br>
single crystal substrate include those composed of corundum-<br>
structured oxide, where a sapphire substrate is one specific<br>
example thereof.<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, in an oxide having corundum-type<br>
structure, a lattice of oxygen (O) atoms has a hexagonal atomic<br>
arrangement, and in the direction of c-axis thereof, O atom (ion)<br>
layers and metal atom (ion: shown as Al in the drawing) layers<br>
are alternatively stacked. In this crystal structure, one of both<br>
atomic layers appearing on both ends in the direction of c-axis<br>
will always be an oxygen atom layer plane, and the other will<br>
always be a metal atom layer plane. The O atom layer plane has<br>
the same O atomic arrangement with the O atom layer in the<br>
wurtzite crystal structure except for difference in the lattice<br>
constants. For the case where the main surface of the oxide<br>
single crystal substrate having such crystal structure will have<br>
formed thereon the buffer layer comprising MgaZn1-aO-type oxide<br>
having the wurtzite crystal structure, a junction structure having<br>
better matching property can be obtained by stacking the metal<br>
atom layer of the buffer layer on the main surface of the<br>
substrate composing the O atom layer plane.<br>
It is to be noted that it is also allowable to grow the light<br>
emitting layer portion on the A-plane of the sapphire substrate as<br>
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-<br>
44500, and this is effective to a certain extent in terms of<br>
planarization of the crystal growth surface. Because the A-plane<br>
of the sapphire substrate has metal atoms and oxygen atoms<br>
exposed thereon in a mixed manner, the general continuous-<br>
growth-type MOVPE process may raise probability of causing<br>
adsorption of oxygen atoms and zinc atoms at the same time on<br>
the A-plane ((11-20) plane). This is more likely to cause<br>
irregularity in the stacking of the buffer layer grown based on the<br>
c-axis orientation, and is not always successful in obtaining a<br>
high-quality buffer layer and light emitting layer portion. Use of<br>
the ALE process, as in the third invention, is now successful in<br>
obtaining a high-quality buffer layer and, consequently, the light<br>
emitting layer portion in a highly reproducible manner, because<br>
the metal monoatomic layer can be formed also on the A-plane in<br>
a forced manner.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Best modes for carrying out the invention will be explained<br>
referring to the drawings.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a drawing schematically showing a stacked<br>
structure of the essential portion of the light emitting device of<br>
the first invention, and the device has a light emitting layer<br>
portion in which an n-type cladding layer 34, an active layer 33<br>
and a p-type cladding layer 2 are stacked in this order. The p-<br>
type cladding layer 2 is composed as a p-type MgxZn1-xO layer (0<br>
=x=1: may occasionally be referred to as p-type MgZnO layer 2.<br>
hereinafter). In the p-type MgZnO layer 2, a trace amount of<br>
either one of, or two or more of N, Ga, Al, In and Li, for example,<br>
are contained as a p-type dopant. The p-type carrier<br>
concentration is adjusted within a range from 1 x1 016 sites/cm3 to<br>
8x1 018 sites/cm3 as described in the above, and more specifically<br>
within a range from 1017 sites/cm3 to 1018 sites/cm3 or around.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic drawing of a crystal structure of<br>
MgZnO, where so-called wurtzite structure is shown. In this<br>
structure, oxygen-ion-packed planes and metal-ion- (Zn ion or Mg<br>
ion) packed planes are stacked along the direction of the c-axis<br>
alternatively, and as shown in Fig. 3, the p-type MgZnO layer 2 is<br>
formed so as to align the c-axis thereof along the thickness-wise<br>
direction. Formation of a vacancy due to omission of an oxygen<br>
ion causes oxygen deficiency, and consequently produces<br>
electrons as n-type carriers. Excessive formation of such oxygen<br>
deficiency undesirably increases the n-type carriers, to thereby<br>
ruin p-type conductivity. it is therefore important that how<br>
completely the oxygen deficiency can be suppressed in order to<br>
form the p-type MgZnO layer.<br>
The p-type MgZnO layer 2 can be formed by the MOVPE<br>
process. Principle of the MOVPE process per se is publicly<br>
known. The aforementioned p-type dopant is added during a<br>
vapor-phase epitaxy process. The p-type MgZnO layer 2 is<br>
annealed during or after completion of a vapor-phase epitaxy<br>
process in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The annealing is<br>
successful in suppressing elimination of oxygen ions, and in<br>
obtaining a desirable p-type MgZnO layer 2 having only a small<br>
amount of oxygen deficiency. It is also effective to carry out the<br>
growth of the p-type MgZnO layer 2 under an atmospheric<br>
pressure of 10 Torr (1.3332 kPa) or above in terms of<br>
suppressing generation of the oxygen deficiency.<br>
Now referring back to Fig. 1, the active layer 33 is<br>
composed of a material having an appropriate band gap<br>
depending on desired emission wavelength. For example, for<br>
those available for visible light emission, materials having band<br>
gap energies Eg (3.10 eV to 2.18 eV or around), capable of<br>
causing light emission in a wavelength range of 400 nm to 570<br>
nm, are selected. Although this range covers emission<br>
wavelength from violet region to green region, those having band<br>
gap energies Eg (2.76 eV to 2.48 eV or around) capable of<br>
causing light emission in a wavelength range of 450 to 500 nm<br>
are selected in particular for the case where blue-color light<br>
emission is desired. On the other hand, those having band gap<br>
energies Eg (4.43 eV to 3.10 eV or around) capable of causing<br>
light emission in a wavelength range of 280 nm to 400 nm are<br>
selected in particular for the case where ultraviolet emission is<br>
desired.<br>
The active layer 33 can be formed typically using a<br>
semiconductor capable of forming a Type-I band lineup between<br>
itself and the p-type MgZnO layer. An example of such active<br>
layer 33 is an MgyZn1-yO layer (where, 0=yy: referred to<br>
as MgZnO active layer, hereinafter). It is to be noted now that "a<br>
Type-I band lineup is formed between the active layer and the p-<br>
type MgZnO layer" means a junction structure, as shown in Fig. 4,<br>
in which the individual energy levels of the bottom of the<br>
conduction band and the upper end of the valence band Ecp, Evp<br>
of the p-type cladding layer (p-type MgZnO layer 2), and the<br>
individual energy levels of the bottom of the conduction band and<br>
the upper end of the valance band ECi, Evi of the active layer<br>
satisfy the following relations of inequality:<br>
ECi 
Evi &gt; Evp â¢â¢â¢ (2)<br>
In this structure, specific barrier will appear for both of the<br>
forward diffusion of holes from the active layer 33 to the n-type<br>
cladding layer 34, and the forward diffusion of electrons (n-type<br>
carriers) to the p-type cladding layer 2. If the material for the n-<br>
type cladding layer 34 is appropriately selected so as to form<br>
Type-I band lineup between the active layer 33 and the n-type<br>
cladding layer 34, similarly to as shown in Fig. 4, the active layer<br>
will have formed therein well-forrmed potential barriers both at the<br>
bottom of the conduction band and the upper end of the valence<br>
band, and will enhance confinement effect both for electrons and<br>
holes. This consequently results in more enhanced effects of<br>
promoting carrier recombination and of improving emission<br>
efficiency. While AIGaN or the like is available for the n-type<br>
cladding layer 34, n-type MgzZn1-zO layer (where 0 = z = 1:<br>
occasionally also referred to as n-type MgZnO layer",<br>
hereinafter) is " more advantageous, because this makes it<br>
possible to form all layers composing the light emitting layer<br>
portion with MgZnO-base oxide material (such light emitting layer<br>
portion will be referred to as "full-oxide-type, light emitting layer<br>
portion, hereinafter), so that it is no more necessary to use rare<br>
metals such as above-described Ga and In (dopants excluded),<br>
which contributes to a considerable cost reduction. Height of the<br>
potential barriers on both sides of the active layer can be<br>
equalized by making the alloy compositions of the n-type MgZnO<br>
layer 34 and the p-type MgZnO identical. Thickness t of the<br>
active layer 33 is selected so as to avoid decrease in the carrier<br>
density in the active layer 33 and excessive increase in the<br>
amount of carriers passing through the active layer 33 based on<br>
the tunneling effect, and is typically adjusted within a range from<br>
30 nm to 1,000 nm.<br>
In the MgZnO active layer 33, a value of alloy composition<br>
y can also serve as a factor which determines band gap energy<br>
Eg. For example, the value is selected in a range of 0=y=0.5<br>
for the case where ultraviolet emission over a wavelength of 280<br>
nm to 400 nm is desired. The potential barrier height thus<br>
formed is preferably 0.1 eV to 0.3 eV or around for light emitting<br>
diode, and 0.25 eV to 0.5 eV or around for semiconductor laser<br>
light source. This value can be determined by selecting the alloy<br>
compositions x, y and z of the p-type MgxZn1-xO layer 2, MgyZn1-<br>
yO active layer 33, and n-type MgzZn1-20 layer 34.<br>
The following paragraphs will describe one exemplary<br>
process for fabricating the light emitting device having the<br>
aforementioned full-oxide-type, light emitting layer portion. First,<br>
as shown in (a) of Fig. 6, a GaN buffer layer 11 is epitaxially<br>
grown on a sapphire substrate 10, and a p-type MgZnO layer 52<br>
(typically of 50 nm thick), an MgZnO active layer 53 (typically of<br>
30 nm thick), and an n-type MgZnO layer 54 (typically of 50 nm<br>
thick) are formed in this order (inverted order of the growth also<br>
acceptable). The epitaxial growth of the individual layers can be<br>
carried out by the MOVPE process as described in the above. It<br>
is to be noted that, MBE in the context of this specification<br>
include not only MBE in a narrow sense in which both of a metal<br>
element component source and a non-metal element component<br>
source are used in solid forms, but also include MOMBE (Metal<br>
Organic Molecular Beam Epitaxy) using the metal element<br>
component source in a form of organometallic compound and the<br>
non-metal element component source in a solid form; gas source<br>
MBE using the metal element component source in a solid form<br>
and the non-metal element component in a gas form; and<br>
chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) using the metal element component<br>
source in a form of organometallic compound and the non-metal<br>
element component source in a gas form.<br>
All of the p-type. MgZnO layer 52, MgZnO active layer 53<br>
and the n-type MgZnO layer 54 can continuously be formed by<br>
the MOVPE process using the same source materials and in the<br>
same reaction vessel as shown in Fig. 5A. In this case, the<br>
growth is preferably allowed to proceed at slightly lower<br>
temperatures, typically at 300Â°C to 400Â°C, so as to reduce<br>
reactivity with the GaN buffer layer (not shown in Fig. 5A), and to<br>
raise the lattice matching property. The substrate can be heated<br>
using a heater embedded in a susceptor for holding the substrate,<br>
as shown in Fig. 5B.<br>
Examples of the major materials for composing the<br>
individual layers are such as follows:<br>
â¢ oxygen component source gas: preferably supplied in a form<br>
of oxidative compound gas in view of suppressing an excessive<br>
reaction with organometallic compounds described later, although<br>
oxygen gas is allowable, typified by N2O, NO, NO2 and CO,<br>
where N2O (nitrous oxide) adopted in this embodiment;<br>
Zn source (metal component source) gas: dimethyl zinc<br>
(DMZn), diethyl zinc (DEZn), etc.; and<br>
Mg source (metal component source) gas: bis-<br>
cyclopentadienyl magnesium (Cp2Mg), etc.<br>
Examples of the p-type dopant gas include the followings;<br>
â¢ Li source gas: n-butyl lithium, etc.;<br>
â¢ Si source gas: silicon hydrides such as monosilane;<br>
â¢ C source gas: hydrocarbons (typically alkyl containing one or<br>
more C atoms); and<br>
â¢ Se source gas: hydrogen selenide, etc.<br>
One or more selected from the group consisting of Al, Ga<br>
and In can be allowed to function as excellent p-type dopants<br>
when added together with N. Examples of the dopant gas include<br>
the followings:<br>
â¢ Al source gas: trimethyl aluminum (TMAI), triethyl aluminum<br>
(TEAI), etc.;<br>
Ga source gas: trimethyl gallium (TMGa), triethyl gallium<br>
(TEGa), etc.; and<br>
â¢ In source gas: trimethyl indium (TMIn), triethyl indium (TEIn),<br>
etc.<br>
For the case where N is used as a p-type dopant together<br>
with a metal element (Ga), the p-type MgZnO layer is grown<br>
while supplying a gas which serves as an N source together with<br>
an organometallic gas which serves as a Ga source. In<br>
particular in this embodiment, N2O used as an oxygen component<br>
source also serves as an N source.<br>
The individual source gases are fed into the reaction vessel<br>
after being appropriately diluted with a carrier gas (nitrogen gas,<br>
for example). Ratio of flow rates of the organometallic compound<br>
gases MO which respectively serves as Mg source and Zn source<br>
is controlled using mass flow controllers MFC or the like,<br>
corresponding to variety in the alloy composition of the individual<br>
layers. Also flow rates of N2O, which is an oxygen component<br>
source gas, and a p-type dopant source gas are controlled by the<br>
mass flow controllers MFC.<br>
The n-type MgZnO layer 54 can be grown by a method in<br>
which oxygen deficiency is intentionally produced so as to attain<br>
n-type conductivity, where it is effective to lower the atmospheric<br>
pressure (lower than 10 Torr (1.3332 kPa), for example) than that<br>
in the cases where the MgZnO active layer 53 and the p-type<br>
MgZnO layer 52 is formed. It is also allowable to form the layer<br>
by separately introducing an n-type dopant. It is still also<br>
allowable to increase ratio of Group II to Group VI elements<br>
(supply II/VI ratio) of the source materials.<br>
For the growth of the MgZnO active layer 53 and p-type<br>
MgZnO layer 52, a unique method capable of suppressing oxygen<br>
deficiency as described in the next is adopted. That is, as<br>
expressed by two patterns (a) and (b) shown in Fig. 5A, the layer<br>
is grown while continuously supplying an oxygen component<br>
source gas (N2O), whereas intermittently interrupting supply of<br>
the organometallic gases, to thereby make use of the time<br>
duration of interrupted supply of the organometallic gases as an<br>
effective duration of the annealing for suppressing generation of<br>
the oxygen deficiency, or for repairing the undesirably generated<br>
oxygen deficiency.<br>
The oxygen deficiency is caused by elimination of oxygen<br>
during the layer growth. To suppress the oxygen deficiency, it is<br>
therefore essential to fully react metal ions (Zn and Mg) derived<br>
from the organometallic gases with oxygen derived from the<br>
oxygen component source gas. Because bond energy between<br>
oxygen and Zn or Mg is relatively large oxygen once bound with<br>
the metals in a stoichiometric manner will become less likely to<br>
be eliminated again. It is, however, considered that oxygen<br>
tends to be eliminated in an intermediate state where the<br>
reaction is not fully completed, and that the layer growth at the<br>
lower temperature region as described in the above is<br>
particularly causative of the oxygen deficiency due to the<br>
incomplete reaction.<br>
It is therefore preferable, as shown in Fig. 7A, to proceed<br>
the layer growth only to an extremely small thickness so as to<br>
prevent the oxygen deficiency from being incorporated deep<br>
inside the layer, and then, as shown in Fig. 7B, to anneal the<br>
layer while interrupting the supply of the organometallic gases<br>
but continuing only the supply of the oxygen component source<br>
gas (N2O), because the reaction between unreacted portions of<br>
the oxygen component source gas and organometallic metal<br>
gases is promoted, and the formation of the oxygen deficiency is<br>
suppressed. Even if the oxygen deficiency should generate, it is<br>
expected that the oxygen component source gas decomposes<br>
and generated oxygen is adsorbed so as to repair the oxygen<br>
deficiency. After completion of the annealing over a duration of<br>
time necessary and sufficient for fully expressing these effects,<br>
the supply of the organometallic compound gas is restarted as<br>
shown in Fig. 7C, to thereby further continue the layer growth.<br>
These processes are repeated thereafter. Fig. 8A shows an<br>
exemplary supply sequence of the organometallic gases (MO)<br>
and the oxygen component source gas. Growth of the MgZnO<br>
active layer 53 and the p-type MgZnO layer 52 can be proceeded<br>
basically in a similar manner, except that the dopant gas is not<br>
supplied for the former, but supplied only for the latter.<br>
In this case, it is necessary that the surface of the layers<br>
during the annealing is kept at a temperature higher by 100Â°C or<br>
more than the layer growth temperature and lower than the<br>
melting point of the oxide (700Â°C in this embodiment), in order to<br>
promote decomposition of the oxygen component source gas,<br>
rearrangement of the adsorbed! oxygen for repairing the oxygen<br>
deficiency, and binding reaction with metal ions already<br>
incorporated within the layer. The temperature higher by less<br>
than 100Â°C than the layer growth temperature may result in only<br>
an insufficient effect of suppressing the oxygen deficiency. On<br>
the other hand, it is self-evident that the temperature exceeding<br>
the melting point of the oxide is nonsense. Because the<br>
annealing temperature is set higher than the substrate<br>
temperature in the layer growth, it is convenient to use a<br>
separate heater specialized for the annealing, besides a heater<br>
for heating the substrate. The separate heater is exemplified by<br>
an infrared lamp in Fig. 5A.<br>
Once the oxygen deficiency is formed in the newly-grown<br>
portion of the layer, it is advantageous to anneal the layer before<br>
the oxygen deficiency is buried in view of smoothly repairing it<br>
under milder conditions. It is therefore effective to set a unit of<br>
the discontinuous (intermittent) layer growth to monoatomic layer<br>
(adjacent oxygen packing layer and metal ion packing layer are<br>
deemed to comprise monoatomic layer) or around. Introduction<br>
period s for the organometallic compound gas is thus set so as to<br>
afford an amount of introduction of the gas necessary for the<br>
growth of the monoatomic layer.<br>
The introduction of the organometallic compound gases<br>
may be effected in a period s" longer than the period s for<br>
forming a complete monoatomic layer as shown in Fig. 9A, or<br>
may be effected in a shorter period s" as shown in Fig. 9B, so far<br>
as it falls within a range from 0.5 atomic layers to 2 atomic layers.<br>
The introduction period s less than 0.5-atomic-layers-equivalent<br>
time may lower the fabrication efficiency, and the exceeding 2-<br>
atomic-layers-equivalent time may reduce the merit of the<br>
intermittent layer growth, because time of annealing for<br>
suppressing the oxygen deficiency becomes too long. The<br>
introduction time s of the organometallic compound gases is,<br>
therefore, preferably set considering the time required for<br>
reaction of oxygen atoms with the metal atoms, and relaxation of<br>
strain in the crystal lattice.<br>
On the other hand, the annealing time needs some<br>
consideration. The reaction per se between the metal atom and<br>
oxygen atom completes within a relatively short time, but an<br>
additional time is substantially necessary for purging of the<br>
organometallic gas out from the reaction vessel in order to<br>
ensure uniform reaction (while actual variation pattern of flow<br>
rate should always show transient periods in which flow rate of<br>
the organometallic gas varies with time, when switched from the<br>
annealing period including the purge-out time, the transient<br>
periods are not illustrated in Figs. 8A to 8C, and Figs. 9A and 9B<br>
for simplicity). Assuming now that the sectional area of the<br>
reaction vessel allowing the gas flow as 20 cm2 as shown in Fig.<br>
5B, a total gas volume as 50 liters/min (converted value for the<br>
standard state), and a length of the heated portion including the<br>
substrate along the gas flow direction as 5.0 cm, a minimum<br>
necessary time for the purging is calculated as 0.002 seconds.<br>
However, the time for purging of 0.002 seconds is practically<br>
insufficient, because it is technically difficult to keep a signal<br>
input/output cycle of a gas sequencer precisely as short as less<br>
than 0.1 seconds, and a stagnation layer is formed in the vicinity<br>
of the inner wall of the reaction vessel and at the heated portion<br>
including the substrate, where the flow rate is slower. It is<br>
therefore preferable to set an interruption time for the<br>
introduction of the organometallic compound as long as 1 second<br>
or more so as to tolerate the mechanical accuracy. Specific<br>
conditions for the annealing typically relate to a nitrogen flow<br>
rate of 10 liters/min (converted value for the standard state), N2O<br>
flow of 1 liter/min (converted value for the standard state), a<br>
layer surface temperature of 700Â°C, a pressure of 760 Torr<br>
(101.3 kPa), and a retention period for one cycle of 5 to 15<br>
seconds.<br>
It is also allowable to keep supply of a small amount of the<br>
organometallic compound gas during annealing period, as shown<br>
in Fig. 8B, rather than completely interrupting the supply, so far<br>
as the suppressive effect for the oxygen deficiency will not<br>
largely be ruined. It is also allowable to reduce the supply<br>
volume of the oxygen component source gas from the supply<br>
volume during the layer growth as shown in Fig. 8C, because<br>
oxygen during the annealing period is necessary only in an<br>
amount consumed for suppressing or repairing the oxygen<br>
deficiency. It is still also allowable to gradually increase or<br>
decrease the amount of supply of the organometallic compound<br>
gas as shown in Fig. 8D, instead of the step-wise variation<br>
shown in Fig. 8A.<br>
During the layer growth while introducing the<br>
organometallic gases, it is effective to keep pressure in the<br>
reaction vessel at 10 Torr (1.3332 kPa) or above. This is more<br>
successful in suppressing the oxygen elimination, and in growing<br>
the MgZnO layer having a less amount of oxygen deficiency. In<br>
particular for the case where N2O is used as the oxygen<br>
component source, the above-described setting of the pressure<br>
successfully prevents N2O from being rapidly dissociated, and<br>
this makes it possible to more effectively suppress generation of<br>
the oxygen deficiency. The higher the atmospheric pressure<br>
rises, the larger a suppressive effect for the oxygen elimination<br>
becomes, where a pressure of only as high as 760 Torr (1atm, or<br>
101.3 kPa) or around may be sufficient for obtaining the effect.<br>
Adoption of a pressure of 760 Torr (101.3 kPa) or below means<br>
that the reaction vessel is conditioned at normal pressure or<br>
reduced pressure, and this requires only a relatively simple seal<br>
structure of the vessel. On the contrary, adoption of a pressure<br>
exceeding 760 Torr (101.3 kPa) means that the vessel is<br>
pressurized, and this requires a slightly stronger seal structure in<br>
order to prevent leakage of the internal gases, and further<br>
requires a pressure-proof structure or the like for the case where<br>
the pressure is considerably high, where the suppressive effect<br>
for the oxygen elimination becomes more distinctive in anyway.<br>
The upper limit of the pressure in this case should be determined<br>
to an appropriate value considering a balance between the cost<br>
of the apparatus and attainable suppressive effect for the oxygen<br>
elimination (typically 7,600 Torr (10 atm, or 1.013 MPa) or<br>
around).<br>
After completion of the growth of the light emitting layer<br>
portion, a metal reflective layer 22 is formed on the n-type<br>
MgZnO layer 54 as shown in (b) of Fig. 6, the sapphire substrate<br>
10 is separated as shown in (c) of Fig. 6, and a transparent<br>
conductive material layer 25 (e.g., ITO film) is formed on the p-<br>
type MgZnO layer 52. Thereafter as shown in (d) of Fig. 6, the<br>
light emitting device 104 is obtained by dicing. It is also<br>
allowable herein to leave the growth substrate such as sapphire<br>
substrate unseparated, and to use it as a part of the device.<br>
The annealing for suppressing the oxygen deficiency for<br>
the MgZnO active layer 53 and p-type MgZnO layer 52 may<br>
collectively be carried out after the layer growth completed. In<br>
this case, it is also allowable to carry out the annealing after the<br>
substrate is transferred to a separate furnace specialized for<br>
annealing different from the reaction vessel. The annealing is<br>
preferably carried out each time the MgZnO active layer 53 and<br>
p-type MgZnO layer 52 are grown. In view of repairing the<br>
oxygen deficiency incorporated into the layer, the annealing is<br>
preferably carried out at a temperature range slightly higher than<br>
that in the case where the layer growth and annealing are<br>
repeated in an intermittent manner. Specific conditions for the<br>
annealing typically relates to nitrogen flow rate of 10 liters/min<br>
(converted value for the standard state), N2O flow rate of 1<br>
liter/min (converted value for the standard state), a layer surface<br>
temperature of 800Â°C, a pressure of 760 Torr (101.3 kPa), and an<br>
annealing period of 30 minutes.<br>
The active layer 33 shown in Fig. 1 can also be formed<br>
using a semiconductor capable of forming a Type-ll band lineup<br>
between itself and the p-type MgZnO layer 2. An example of<br>
such active layer 33 is an InGaN layer (referred to as InGaN<br>
active layer, hereinafter). It is to be noted now that "a Type-ll<br>
band lineup is formed between the active layer and the p-type<br>
MgxZn1-xO layer" means a junction structure as shown in Fig. 10A,<br>
in which the individual energy levels of the bottom of the<br>
conduction band and the upper end of the valence band Ecp, Evp<br>
of the p-type cladding layer (p-type MgxZn1-xO layer 2), and the<br>
individual energy levels of the bottom of the conduction band and<br>
the upper end of the valance band Eci, Evi of the active layer<br>
satisfy the following relations of inequality:<br>
Eci &gt; Ecp â¢â¢â¢ (3)<br>
Evi &gt; Evp â¢â¢â¢ (4)<br>
In this structure, no specific barrier will appear for the<br>
forward diffusion of electrons (n-type carriers) from the active<br>
layer to the p-type cladding layer, but a relatively high potential<br>
barrier is formed for the reverse diffusion of holes (p-type<br>
carriers) from the active layer to the p-type cladding layer. This<br>
promotes carrier recombination in the active layer, and can<br>
achieve high emission efficiency. Assuming now that the layer is<br>
expressed as lnaGa1-aN, where a is an InN alloy composition, a<br>
relation of 0.34=a=0.47 is preferably adopted for blue visible<br>
light emission, and a relation of 0=a=0.19 is preferably adopted<br>
for ultraviolet emission.<br>
In this case, the n-type cladding layer 34 preferably uses a<br>
semiconductor capable of forming a Type-I band lineup between<br>
itself and the active layer. An example of such n-type cladding<br>
layer 34 is an n-type AIGaN (AlpGa1-ÃN) layer. It is to be noted<br>
now that "a Type-I band lineup is formed between the n-type<br>
53<br>
cladding layer and the active layer" means a junction structure,<br>
as shown in Fig. 10A, in which the individual energy levels of the<br>
bottom of the conduction band and the upper end of the valence<br>
band Eci, EVi of the active layer, and the individual energy levels<br>
of the bottom of the conduction band and the upper end of the<br>
valance band Ecn, Evn of the n-type cladding layer (n-type AIGaN<br>
layer 4) satisfy the following relations of inequality:<br>
Eci 
Evi &gt; Evn â¢â¢â¢ (6)<br>
In this structure, a relatively high potential barrier is<br>
formed for the reverse diffusion of electrons from the n-type<br>
cladding layer to the active layer, and a well-type potential<br>
barrier is formed at the upper end of the valence band<br>
corresponding to the position of the active layer, to thereby<br>
enhance the confinement effect of holes. All of these promote<br>
carrier recombination in the active layer, and consequently<br>
achieve high emission efficiency.<br>
In the structures shown in Fig. 10A, a suppressive effect of<br>
reverse diffusion of holes from the active layer to the p-type<br>
cladding layer can successfully be raised by increasing the<br>
energy barrier height (Evi - Evp) at the upper end of the valence<br>
band. For this purpose, it is effective to raise MgO alloy<br>
composition of the p-type MgxZ1-xO layer 2 (that is, value of x)<br>
composing the p-type cladding layer. The alloy composition x is<br>
determined depending on desired current density, so as not to<br>
cause excessive leakage of the carriers towards the p-type<br>
cladding layer. In a typical case where the active layer 33 is<br>
composed of an InGaN layer, the alloy composition x is<br>
preferably set within a range from 0.05 to 0.2 or around for light<br>
emitting diode, and 0.1 to 0.4 or around for semiconductor laser<br>
light source.<br>
The bottom of the conductive band descends in a step-wise<br>
manner from the active layer towards the p-type cladding layer,<br>
and the electrons not contributed to the emissive recombination<br>
in the active layer then flow into the p-type cladding layer having<br>
a higher carrier concentration, and become no more contributable<br>
to light emission due to Auger recombination or the like. In order<br>
to raise the emission efficiency, it is therefore necessary that<br>
electrons as much as possible recombine with holes before they<br>
flow into the p-type cladding layer, and it is therefore effective to<br>
increase the thickness t of the active layer to a certain level or<br>
above (e.g., 30 nm or above). As shown in Fig. 10B, too small<br>
thickness t of the active layer increases electrons possibly flow<br>
into the p-type cladding layer and become not contributable to<br>
the light emission, and this results in lowered emission efficiency.<br>
On the other hand, increase in the thickness t of the active layer<br>
beyond a necessary level results in lowered carrier density in the<br>
active layer and thus lowers the emission efficiency. The<br>
thickness is thus typically set to 2 Âµm or below.<br>
In Fig. 10A, it is advantageous in view of suppressing non-<br>
emissive recombination at the junction boundary that a relation of<br>
Ecp &gt; Evi is satisfied similarly for the case where the InGaN<br>
active layer is used, that is, the p-type cladding layer and the<br>
active layer have forbidden bands which overlap with each other.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
The next paragraphs will describe an embodiment of the<br>
second invention. Since the essential portion of the light<br>
emitting device to which the second invention is applicable is<br>
same as described in Embodiment 1, detailed description will be<br>
omitted (see Figs. 1 to 4, and F:igs. 1 OA and 10B). As shown in<br>
(a) of Fig. 6, the GaN buffer layer 11 is epitaxially grown again<br>
on the sapphire substrate 10, and further thereon the p-type<br>
MgZnO layer 52 (typically of 50 nm thick), the MgZnO active<br>
layer 53 (typically of 30 nm thick) and the n-type MgZnO layer 54<br>
(typically of 50 nm thick) are formed in this order (inverted order<br>
of the growth also acceptable). The epitaxial growth of the<br>
individual layers in this embodiment can be carried out by the<br>
MOVPE process similarly to as described in Embodiment 1,<br>
where differences reside in the following points. More<br>
specifically, in the growth of the MgZnO active layer 53 and p-<br>
type MgZnO layer 52 herein, a ultraviolet lamp (e.g., excimer<br>
ultraviolet lamp) as a ultraviolet light source is disposed<br>
opposing to the main surface of the substrate in order to<br>
suppress the generation of the oxygen deficiency, and the source<br>
gases are supplied between the substrate and ultraviolet light<br>
source while irradiating ultraviolet light from the ultraviolet lamp<br>
towards the main surface of the substrate.<br>
Figs. 11 A and 11 B show an apparatus used for vapor-phase<br>
epitaxy process of the light emitting layer portion using the<br>
ultraviolet lamp based on the MOVPE process.. Similarly to as<br>
described previously referring to Fig. 5A, all of the p-type MgZnO<br>
layer, MgZnO active layer and n-type MgZnO layer can<br>
sequentially be formed in the same reaction vessel using the<br>
same source gases. In this case, it is preferable to proceed the<br>
growth at slightly lower temperatures, typically at 300 to 400Â°C<br>
so as to reduce the reactivity with the GaN buffer layer and raise<br>
the lattice matching property. The substrate can be heated using<br>
a heater embedded in a susceptor for holding the substrate.<br>
The wall portion of the reaction vessel is configured as a<br>
transparent wall portion composed of a quartz glass or the like,<br>
and the ultraviolet lamp is disposed outside the reaction vessel,<br>
so as to effect the ultraviolet irradiation through the transparent<br>
wall portion towards the substrate. The ultraviolet lamp available<br>
herein has an emission wavelength of approximately 172 nm, and<br>
an output power density of approximately 8 mW/cm2 when the<br>
flow rates of N2O and organometallic compound gas are within a<br>
range from 100 cm3/min to 1,000 cm3/min and 10 cm3/min to 100<br>
cm3/min, respectively.<br>
It is supposed that ultraviolet light irradiated to the<br>
substrate is once absorbed by the substrate, and can highly<br>
activate the outermost portion of the layers under growth based<br>
on the light excitation effect. That is, a highly activated status<br>
similarly to as obtained in the layer growth under high<br>
temperatures can locally be realized in the ouiermost portion of<br>
the layer. Also a part of the source gases is brought into a high-<br>
energy transition status (radical, etc.) by the ultraviolet<br>
irradiation. As a consequence, the organometallic gases and<br>
oxygen component source gas (N2O) can react in the vicinity of<br>
the activated outermost portion of the layer, in a stoichiometric<br>
manner without causing unreacted components or the like, and<br>
the layer growth is promoted in a manner less causative of the<br>
oxygen deficiency.<br>
Radicals of the organometallic gases and oxygen<br>
component source gas are unstable in general, and the radicals<br>
ascribable to these components will be converted into other<br>
decomposition products not contributable to the oxide formation<br>
reaction, if a status in which these radicals are brought into a<br>
close vicinity enough for causing reaction is not realized for a<br>
long duration of time. While this kind of decomposition reaction<br>
is more likely to proceed as temperature of the system elevates,<br>
this can be suppressed to a certain extent typically by lowering<br>
the substrate temperature to as relatively low as 400Â°C or below.<br>
The ultraviolet irradiation can enhance reaction activity in the<br>
vicinity of the main surface of the substrate, and this makes it<br>
possible to readily form the oxide semiconductor layer having<br>
only a less amount of oxygen deficiency even when the substrate<br>
temperature cannot be raised so high for various reasons.<br>
On the other hand, probability of the oxide formation<br>
reaction contributable to the layer growth is higher in the<br>
boundary layer (in which mass transfer is governed by diffusion,<br>
also referred to as stagnation layer), and lower in an area<br>
outside the boundary layer and having a large gas flow rate. It is<br>
thus understood that the larger the flow rate of the gas flowing<br>
through the reaction vessel grows, the thinner the boundary layer<br>
becomes, and the growth speed of the oxide is depressed.<br>
Adjusting now the flow rate of the source gases supplied between<br>
the substrate and the ultraviolet lamp (ultraviolet light source) so<br>
as to be faster on the ultraviolet light source side than that on<br>
the main surface side as shown in Fig. 11 B, the reaction products<br>
become less likely to deposit on the wall portion of the reaction<br>
vessel in the vicinity of the ultraviolet lamp, and this makes it<br>
possible to avoid a nonconformity such that the deposit shadows<br>
ultraviolet light from the light source to thereby degrade the<br>
reaction efficiency. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 11B, a<br>
gas intake port and a gas discharge port of the reaction vessel<br>
are formed so as to be divided into a first gas intake/discharge<br>
port, and a second gas intake/discharge port, and the flow rate is<br>
adjusted so as to make a gas flow rate ?1 on the first gas<br>
intake/discharge port side is faster than a gas flow rate ?2 on the<br>
second gas intake/discharge port side.<br>
The ultraviolet lamp is advantageous in view of ensuring a<br>
large irradiation area, and of allowing the reaction for the oxide<br>
layer formation to proceed in a uniform and efficient manner. On<br>
the other hand, it is also allowable to irradiate a ultraviolet laser<br>
beam in a two-dimensional scanning manner over the substrate<br>
as shown in Fig. 12. This system can use a light convergence<br>
density larger than that available from the ultraviolet lamp, and<br>
thus further enhance the reaction efficiency, in an exemplary<br>
configuration shown in Fig. 12, a laser light source composed as<br>
an excimer laser light source or a semiconductor laser light<br>
source is scanned in the X direction with the aid of a polygon<br>
mirror, and in synchronization therewith a susceptor holding the<br>
substrate is driven in the Y direction, which crosses the X<br>
direction, with the aid of a Y-scanning table, so as to scan over<br>
the entire portion of the main surface of the substrate with the<br>
laser beam in a two-dimensional manner.<br>
The process steps after completion of the growth of the<br>
light emitting layer portion are same as those described in<br>
Embodiment 1 referring to (b) to (d) of Fig.6.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
The next paragraphs will describe an embodiment of the<br>
third invention. Although the essential portion of the light<br>
emitting device to which the third invention is applicable is<br>
almost the same as described in Embodiment 1 (see Figs. 1 to<br>
5A, and Figs. 10A and 10B), it is essential in the third invention<br>
to form the buffer layer as described below. That is, the buffer<br>
layer has the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal structure oriented to<br>
the thickness-wise direction, has a single metal atom layer as a<br>
metal monoatomic layer formed in contact with the substrate, and<br>
has the residual oxygen atom layers and metal atom layers<br>
alternatively stacked successive to the metal monoatomic layer.<br>
An exemplary fabrication process will be explained below.<br>
First as shown in Fig. 13, a buffer layer 111 composed of<br>
MgZnO is epitaxially grown on the sapphire substrate 10, and<br>
further thereon an n-type MgZnO layer 34 (typically of 50 nm<br>
thick), an MgZnO active layer 33 (typically of 30 nm thick) and a<br>
p-type MgZnO layer 32 (typically of 50 nm thick) are formed in<br>
this order (inverted order of the growth or layers 32 to 35 also<br>
acceptable). These layers can be grown by the MOVPE process.<br>
By the MOVPE process, all of the buffer layer 111, n-type<br>
MgZnO layer 34, MgZnO active layer 33 and p-type MgZnO layer<br>
32 can continuously be formed by the MOVPE process using the<br>
same source materials and in the same reaction vessel as shown<br>
in Figs. 14A to 14C. Temperature in the reaction vessel is<br>
adjusted using a heating source (an infrared lamp in this<br>
embodiment) so as to promote the chemical reactions for the<br>
layer growth. Major source materials for the individual layers<br>
and style of feeding thereof are the same as those described in<br>
Embodiments 1 and 2.<br>
The buffer layer 111 is grown as descried in the next. Fig.<br>
17 shows a control sequence of temperature in the reaction<br>
vessel and introduction of the individual gases in this<br>
embodiment. The substrate 10 on which the layers are grown is<br>
a sapphire (i,e., single crystal alumina) substrate having the c-<br>
axis as the principal crystal axis, where the main surface on the<br>
oxygen-exposed plane side shown in Fig. 15 is used as a layer<br>
growth plane. Prior to the layer growth, the substrate 10 is<br>
thoroughly annealed under an oxidative gas atmosphere. The<br>
oxidative gas may be any of those selected from O2,CO and N2O,<br>
where N2O is selected in this embodiment so as to be used also<br>
as the oxygen component source gas in the layer growth<br>
described later. For the case where the annealing is carried out<br>
in the reaction vessel for the MOVPE process, preferable<br>
conditions for the annealing relate to a temperature of 750Â°C or<br>
above (but lower than the melting point of the substrate), and an<br>
annealing time of 30 minutes or more. It is, however, also<br>
allowable to shorten the above described annealing time it the<br>
surface of the substrate can be cleaned to a satisfactory level by<br>
wet cleaning or the like.<br>
After completion of the annealing, the substrate<br>
temperature is lowered to a first temperature which is set to 250<br>
to 300oC (set to 350Â°C herein) as shown in Fig. 17 in order to<br>
suppress generation of the oxygen deficiency, while keeping the<br>
oxidative gas atmosphere After the temperature is stabilized at<br>
a set value, supply of the oxidative gas is interrupted, and the<br>
gas is then thoroughly purged out by replacing the inner<br>
atmosphere of the reaction vessel with nitrogen gas. It is<br>
preferable to set the purging time to 5 seconds or longer,<br>
although variable depending on shape and capacity of the<br>
reaction vessel.<br>
Next, as shown in Figs. 14A and 16A, the organometallic<br>
gas MO is supplied into the reaction vessel, and the first metal<br>
atomic layer which composes a part of the buffer layer 111 is<br>
formed as a monoatomic layer by the ALE process. As previously<br>
explained in the above, growth of the monoatomic layer in the<br>
ALE process saturates once a single atomic layer is completed<br>
based on the self-termination function, and no more growth of the<br>
metal atomic layer would occur even if the supply of the<br>
organometallic compound gas MO is continued.<br>
Thereafter the supply of the organometallic gas MO is<br>
interrupted, the gas is thoroughly purged out by replacing the<br>
inner atmosphere of the reaction vessel with nitrogen gas, and as<br>
shown in Fig. 16C, N2O is introduced as the oxygen component<br>
source gas (and also as a gas for creating the oxidative<br>
atmosphere), and the oxygen atom layer is formed only by a<br>
single atomic layer by the ALE process. This results in the<br>
formation of the MgZnO layer only by a single atomic layer on the<br>
substrate 1 0.<br>
The temperature in the reaction vessel is thereafter<br>
increased to a second temperature which is set to 400 to 800Â°C<br>
(set to 750Â°C herein) as shown in Fig. 17 while keeping the<br>
oxidative gas atmosphere, and also keeping the organometallic<br>
gas continuously supplied, so as to form the residual portion of<br>
the buffer layer by the general MOVPE process as shown in Figs.<br>
14B and 16D. In this process, the buffer layer 111 having an<br>
excellent planarity can be obtained by growing the layer at a<br>
speed of 0.1 nm/sec or around until a thickness of 10 nm or<br>
around is attained, and thereafter at a speed of 1 nm/sec. In<br>
view of obtaining the buffer layer excellent both in the<br>
crystailinity and planarity, it is also preferable to grow a plurality<br>
of layers from the first layers by the ALE process.<br>
Although the buffer layer 111 of this embodiment is formed<br>
as a simple oxide layer comprising ZnO, it may also be formed as<br>
a composite oxide layer of MgZnO having an appropriate alloy<br>
composition harmonized with the alloy composition of the<br>
adjacent layer on the light emitting-portion side. The Al atom<br>
layer located just below the outermost oxygen atom layer of the<br>
sapphire substrate comprises, as shown in Fig. 18A, two Al atom<br>
sites AI-1 and AI-2, which differ from each other in the distance<br>
to the oxygen layer. Assuming now that the metal atom layer<br>
formed on the oxygen layer is a Zn atom layer, both sites AI-1<br>
and AI-2 differ in the Coulomb repulsive force between Zn atom<br>
and Al atom located while placing the oxygen layer in between.<br>
For this reason, Zn atoms corresponding to both sites will have<br>
different displacement in the direction normal to the plane of the<br>
oxygen atom layer, and this may causative of irregularity in<br>
stacking of the later-coming layers. To relieve this effect, as<br>
shown in Figs. 18B and 18C, it is effective to form the first single<br>
atomic layer (or a plurality of layers) as a composite oxide layer<br>
which contains Group II atom (e.g., Mg) having a smaller ionic<br>
radius than Zn, or Group II atom (e.g., Ca, Sr, Ba) having a<br>
larger ionic radius by an appropriate ratio, and this can improve<br>
the crystallinity of the light emitting layer portion to be obtained.<br>
It is now also effective, in view of enhancing the above-described<br>
effect, to dispose a compositionr-gradient layer, having metal<br>
cation composition gradated in the thickness-wise direction,<br>
between such composite oxide layer (having a metal cation<br>
composition A) and the cladding layer (having a metal cation<br>
composition B: n-type MgZnO layer 54 herein) formed in contact<br>
with the buffer layer 111, in order to ensure continuity between<br>
both compositions A and B, as shown in Fig. 19A. In an<br>
exemplary case where both of the composite oxide layer and<br>
cladding layer are composed of MgZnO, the composition-gradient<br>
layer can be formed so that composition parameter v varies<br>
continuously between A and B typically as shown in Fig. 19B,<br>
where composition parameter v represents metal cation<br>
composition and is given by v = NMg/(NMg + NZn), where NMg is<br>
molar content of Mg, and NZn is molar content of Zn; A is an<br>
expression of v for the composite oxide layer, and B is that for<br>
the cladding layer.<br>
After the buffer layer 111 is completed, as shown in Fig.<br>
14C, the n-type MgZnO layer 34, MgZnO active layer 33 and p-<br>
type MgZnO layer 32 are formed in this order by the MOVPE<br>
process. These process steps are basically same as those<br>
described in Embodiments 1 and 2.<br>
In this embodiment, after completion of the growth of the<br>
light emitting layer portion, the active layer 33 and the p-type<br>
MgZnO layer 32 are partially removed by photolithography or the<br>
like as shown in Fig. 13, a transparent electrode 125 comprising<br>
indi.um tin oxide (ITO) or the like is formed, a metal electrode 122<br>
is formed on the residual p-type MgZnO layer 32, and the layers<br>
are then diced together with the substrate 10 to thereby produce<br>
the light emitting device 1. It is thus self-evident that the light<br>
emitting device 1 is configured so that the buffer layer 111<br>
composed of MgZnO is formed on the substrate 10, and further<br>
thereon the light emitting layer portion again composed of<br>
MgZnO is formed. Light extraction is therefore available mainly<br>
on the transparent sapphire substrate 10 side.<br>
It is to be noted that the light emitting device can of course<br>
be configured as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the layers are<br>
formed on the buffer layer 111 in an order inverted from that<br>
shown in Fig. 13, that is, the p-type MgZnO layer 32, MgZnO<br>
active layer 33 and n-type MgZnO layer 34 are formed in this<br>
order. This configuration is advantageous in obtaining the device<br>
having an improved weatherabiility, because a metal layer of<br>
MgZnO composing the light emitting layer portion is exposed only<br>
after the substrate 10 is separated.<br>
(Embodiment-4)-<br>
Fig. 20A and 20B schematically show a stacked structure of<br>
the essential portion of the light emitting device in order to<br>
explain one embodiment of the fourth invention. As shown in Fig.<br>
20A, on a substrate 210, a ZnO buffer layer 211, an n-type<br>
MgZnO-type oxide layer 234, a ZnO-base semiconductor active<br>
layer 233 and a p-type MgZnO-type oxide layer 232 are stacked<br>
by the epitaxial growth process while keeping lattice matching, to<br>
thereby form a double hetero, light emitting layer portion 200.<br>
The ZnO-base semiconductor active \ayer (also simply referred to<br>
as active layer) 233 is composed of a ZnO-base semiconductor<br>
containing Zn as a Group H element, and containing O together<br>
with Se or Te as a Group VI element. Fig. 20A shows the active<br>
layer 233 configured as a single layer, whereas Fig. 20B shows<br>
the active layer 233 having a multi-layered structure in which<br>
sub-layers 237 composed of ZnSe or ZnTe are periodically<br>
inserted in a ZnO main layer 236 while keeping an area width<br>
equivalent to or less than one molecular layer of the active layer<br>
233.<br>
As shown in Fig, 20A, by composing the active layer 233<br>
using a ZnO-base semiconductor containing Se or Te, it is made<br>
possible to introduce Se or Te, which belongs to the same Group<br><br>
with oxygen, to oxygen-deficient sites, and this is successful in<br>
improving the crystallinity of the active layer 233 and making the<br>
band gap energy thereof well suited to blue-color light emission<br>
as described in the above. On the other hand, as shown in Fig.<br>
20B, by composing the active layer 233 so as to have a multi-<br>
layered structure in which sub-layers 237 composed of ZnSe or<br>
ZnTe are periodically inserted in a ZnO main layer 236, it is made<br>
possible to enhance binding property of thus introduced Se or Te<br>
with the closest Zn. Although Fig. 20B illustrates the sub-layer<br>
237 as having a coverage ratio of 1, it is also allowable to reduce<br>
the coverage ratio to as smaller than 1 in order to prevent se or<br>
Te from being deposited rather than being introduced into the<br>
oxygen-deficient sites. The number ot formation of the sub-<br>
layers 237 can properly be adjusted depending on desired<br>
emission wavelength in the active layer 233.<br>
The substrate 210 shown in the Figs. 20A and 20B may be<br>
such as those used in Embodiments 1 to 3. Although the ZnO<br>
buffer layer 211 can epitaxially be formed by stacking ZnO<br>
crystal, it is also allowable to epitaxially grow either one of ZnS,<br>
ZnSe and ZnTe, and then convert them to obtain the ZnO buffer<br>
layer 211 by annealing under the oxygen-containing atmosphere.<br>
N-type dopant added to the n-type, MgZnO-type oxide layer<br>
234 (also simply referred to as n-type MgZnO layer 234,<br>
hereinafter) and p-type dopant added to the p-type, MgZnO-type<br>
oxide layer 232 (also simply referred to as p-type MgZnO layer<br>
132, hereinafter) may be such as those used in Embodiments 1<br>
o 3.<br>
The epitaxial growth of the individual layers shown in Fig.<br>
!0A can be carried out based on the MOVPE or WBE prccess. it<br>
is to be noted that MBE in the context of this patent specification<br>
nolude not only MBE in a narrow sense in which both of a metal<br>
element component source and a non-metal element component<br>
source are used in solid forms, but also include MOMBE (Metal<br>
Organic Molecular Beam Epitaxy) usmg the metal element<br>
component source in a form of organometallic compound and the<br>
non-metal element component source in a solid form; gas source<br>
MBE using the metal element component source in a solid form<br>
and the non-metal element component in a gas form; and<br>
chemical team epitaxy (CBE) usin9 the metal element component<br>
source in a form of organometalllic compound and the non-metal<br>
element component source in a gas form.<br>
Also the ZnO main layer 236 shown in Fig. 20B can be<br>
formed by the epitaxial growth process similarly to as described<br>
in the above. On the other hand, the sub-layer 237, which is<br>
composed of ZnSe or ZnTe, ami must be adjust to have an<br>
area width equivalent to or less than a single molecular layer of<br>
the active layer 233, can be formed by the ALE (Atomic layer<br>
Epitaxy) process in which a Zn-source gas and Se or Te source<br>
gas, both serve major source materials, are alternatively supplied.<br>
A proper adjustment of flow rates of thus supplied source gases<br>
makes it possible to reduce the coverage ratio of the sub-layer<br>
237 smaller than 1.<br>
Major source materials for the individual layers, except the<br>
Se source and Te source, may be such as those used in the<br>
MOVPE process in Embodiments 1 to 3, and also the basic<br>
process steps are the same as those described in Embodiments<br>
1 to 3. Available Se-source gases include H2Se, and available<br>
Te-source gases include H2Te.<br>
After completion of the growth of the light emitting layer<br>
portion 200, the substrate 210 is lapped and etched, as shown in<br>
Fig. 21, a p-type electrode 223 composed of In and n-type<br>
electrodes 224 composed of Au are respectively formed, the<br>
stack is diced, and the individual electrodes are bonded with Al<br>
wirings, so as to obtain the ZnO-base semiconductor light<br>
emitting device. Light extraction is therefore available mainly on<br>
the p-type MgZnO layer 232 side. In Fig. 21, the light extraction<br>
is, however, not available from the area where the p-type<br>
electrode 223 is formed. It is therefore advantageous to partially<br>
remove the active layer 233 and p-type MgZnO layer 232 by<br>
photolithography or the like as shown in Fig. 22, a transparent<br>
electrode 225 comprising indium tin oxide (ITO) or the like is<br>
formed, a metal electrode 222 is formed on the residual p-type<br>
MgZnO layer 232, and the layers are then diced together with the<br>
sapphire substrate 221 to thereby produce the ZnO-base<br>
semiconductor light emitting device. Light extraction is therefore<br>
available mainly on the transparent sapphire substrate 221 side.<br><br>
