The present invention relates to novel propargylether derivatives of formula I and a process for their preparation and to agrochemical compositions comprising at least one of those compounds as active ingredient. The invention relates also to the preparation of the said compositions and to the use of the compounds or of the compositions in controlling or preventing the infestation of plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi.<br>
Certain amino acid carbamates, mandelic acid derivatives and alkoximino acid derivatives have been proposed for controlling plant-destructive fungi, (for example, in EP-A-398072, WO 94/29267 and WO 96/17840). The action of those preparations is not, however, satisfactory in all aspects of agricultural needs. Surprisingly, with the compound structure of formula I, new kinds of microbicides having a high level of activity have been found.<br>
The invention relates to propargylether derivatives of the general formula I<br><br>
including the optical isomers thereof and mixtures of such isomers,<br>
wherein<br>
Ri is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl or optionally<br>
substituted aryl;<br>
R.2, R3, R5, R&amp;, and R7 are each independently of each other hydrogen or optionally<br>
substituted alkyl;<br>
R4 is optionally substituted alkyl;<br>
XisOorN-R7;and<br>
Rg is a group <br>
R9 is optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl;<br>
2<br><br>
Rio and Ru are each independently hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally<br>
substituted alkenyl or optionally substituted alkynyl;<br>
R12 is optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl<br>
or optionally substituted heteroaryl;<br>
R13 is hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl; and<br>
R14 is optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted amino.<br>
In the above definition aryl includes aromatic hydrocarbon rings like phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, with phenyl being preferred.<br>
Heteroaryl stands for aromatic ring systems comprising mono-, bi- or tricyclic systems wherein at least one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom is present as a ring member. Typically heteroaryl comprises 1 to 4 identical or different heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, wherein the number of oxygen and sulfuratoms normally does not exceed one. Examples are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, indolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl and naphthyridinyl.<br>
The above aryl and heteroaryl groups may carry one or more identical or different substi-tuents. Normally not more than three substituents are present at the same time. Examples of substituents of aryl or heteroaryl groups are: alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-alkyl, phenyl and phenyl-alkyl, it being possible in turn for all of the preceding groups to carry one or more identical or different halogen atoms; alkoxy; alkenyloxy; alkynyloxy; alkoxyalkyl; haloalkoxy, alkylthio; haloalkylthio; alkylsulfonyl; formyl; alkanoyl; hydroxy; halogen; cyano; nitro; amino; alkylamino; dialkylamino; carboxyl; alkoxycarbonyl; alkenyloxycarbonyl; alkynyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or cycloalkyl groups may carry one or more substituents selected from halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, nitro, cyano, hydroxy, mercapto, alkylcarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl. Preferably, the number of substituents is no more than three with the exception of halogen, where the alkyl groups may be perhalogenated. In the<br><br>
above definitions "halogen" or the prefix "halo" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This applies also to the alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl parts of other alkyl-, alkenyl- or alkynyl-containing groups.<br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkyl on its own or as part of another substituent is to be understood as being, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the isomers thereof, for example isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or sec-butyl, isopentyl or tert-pentyl. Cycloalkyl is, depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, cyclopropyl, cyclo-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkenyl as a group or as a structural element of other groups is to be understood as being, for example, ethenyl, allyl, 1-propenyl, buten-2-yl, buten-3-yl, penten-1-yl, penten-3-yl, hexen-1-yl, 4-methyl-3-pentenyl or 4-methyl-3-hexenyl.<br>
Alkynyl as a group or as a structural element of other groups is, for example, ethynyl, propyn-1-yl (-CH2-CECH), prop-2-ynyl (-C(-CH3)ECH), butyn-1-yl (-CH2-CH2-CECH), butyn-2-yl (-CH2-CEC-CH3), 1-methyl-2-butynyl (-CH(CH3)-CEC-CH3), hexyn-1-yl (-[CH2]4-CECH), 1-ethyl-2-butynyl (-CH(CH2-CH3)-CEC-CH3), or octyn-1-yl.<br>
A haloalkyl group may contain one or more (identical or different) halogen atoms, and for example may stand for CH2CI, CHCI2, CCI3, CH2F, CHF2, CF3, CH2CH2Br, C2CI5, C2F5, CH2Br, CHCIBr, CF3CH2, etc..<br>
The presence of at least one asymmetric carbon atom in the compounds of formula I means that the compounds may occur in optically isomeric and enantiomeric forms. As a result of the presence of a possible aliphatic C=C double bond, geometric isomerism may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those possible isomeric forms and mixtures thereof.<br>

The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and generally stable when stored at ambient temperatures in a warehouse . These compounds are distinguished from known compounds of the chemical class by their valuable microbicidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related fields preventively and curatively in the control of phytopathogenic or plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concentration not only by outstanding microbicidal, especially fungicidal activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous biocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br><br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basicliomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomy-cetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Pe-ronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agricultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distinguished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or<br><br>
insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>
