State of the Art<br>
[0033] VLA-4 (also referred to as a4ß1 integrin and CD49d/CD29), first<br>
identified by Hemler and Takada1, is a member of the ß1 integrin family of<br>
cell surface receptors, each of which comprises two subunits, an a chain and<br>
a ß chain. VLA-4 contains an a4 chain and a ß1 chain. There are at least<br>
nine ß1 integrins, all sharing the same ß1 chain and each having a distinct a<br>
chain. These nine receptors all bind a different complement of the various<br>
cell matrix molecules, such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen. VLA-4,<br>
for example, binds to fibronectin. VLA-4 also binds non-matrix molecules<br>
that are expressed by endothelial and other cells. These non-matrix<br>
molecules include VCAM-1, which is expressed on cytokine-activated<br>
human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. Distinct eß1topes of VLA-<br>
4 are responsible for the fibronectin and VCAM-1 binding activities and<br>
each activity has been shown to be inhibited independently.2<br>
[0034] Intercellular adhesion mediated by VLA-4 and other cell surface<br>
receptors is associated with a number of inflammatory responses. At the site<br>
of an injury or other inflammatory stimulus, activated vascular endothelial<br>
cells express molecules that are adhesive for leukocytes. The mechanics of<br>
leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells involves, in part, the recognition and<br>
binding of cell surface receptors on leukocytes to the corresponding cell<br>
surface molecules on endothelial cells. Once bound, the leukocytes migrate<br>
across the blood vessel wall to enter the injured site and release chemical<br>
mediators to combat infection. For reviews of adhesion receptors of the<br>
immune system, see, for example, Springer3 and Osborn.4<br>
[0035] Inflammatory brain disorders, such as experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyelitis (EAE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and meningitis, are<br>
examples of central nervous system disorders in which the<br>
endothelium/leukocyte adhesion mechanism results in destruction to<br>
otherwise healthy brain tissue. Large numbers of leukocytes migrate across<br>
the blood brain barrier (BBB) in subjects with these inflammatory diseases.<br>
The leukocytes release toxic mediators that cause extensive tissue damage<br>
resulting in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis.<br>
[0036] In other organ systems, tissue damage also occurs via an adhesion<br>
mechanism resulting in migration or activation of leukocytes. For example,<br>
it has been shown that the initial insult following myocardial ischemia to<br>
heart tissue can be further complicated by leukocyte entry to the injured<br>
tissue causing still further insult (Vedder et al.).5 Other inflammatory or<br>
medical conditions mediated by an adhesion mechanism include, by way of<br>
example, asthma,6-8 Alzheimer"s disease, atherosclerosis,9-10 AIDS<br>
dementia,11 diabetes12-14 (including acute juvenile onset diabetes),<br>
inflammatory bowel disease15 (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s<br>
disease), multiple sclerosis,16-17 rheumatoid arthritis,18-21 tissue<br>
transplantation,22 tumor metastasis,23-28 meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, and<br>
other cerebral traumas, nephritis, retinitis, atoß1c dermatitis, psoriasis,<br>
myocardial ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury such as that<br>
which occurs in adult resß1ratory distress syndrome.<br>
[0037] Substituted aminopyrimidines, as a class, have been disclosed as<br>
inhibiting binding of VLA-4 to VCAM-1 and, accordingly, exhibit anti-<br>
inflammatory properties.29 While these compounds possess antagonist<br>
properties to such binding, enhanced bioavailabiiity of these compounds<br>
would augment their efficacy.<br>

[0081] As above, this invention relates to compounds which inhibit leukocyte<br>
adhesion and, in particular, leukocyte adhesion mediated at least in part by a4<br>
integrins, preferably VLA-4. However, prior to describingjhis invention in<br>
further detail, the following terms will first be defined.<br>
Definitions}<br>
[0082] Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification<br>
and claims have the meanings given below:<br>
[0083] As used herein, "lower alkyl" refers to monovalent alkyl groups<br>
having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms including straight and branched chain alkyl<br>
groups. This term is exemplified by groups such as methyl, ethyl, iso-<br>
propyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, r-butyl, n-pentyl and the like.<br>
"Lower alkyl" may be optionally substituted with a halogen, such as chloro,<br>
fluoro, bromo and the like.<br>
[0084] The term "lower alkylene" refers to divalent alkylene groups of from<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms including straight and branched chain alkylene groups.<br>
This term is exemplied by groups such as methylene, ethylene, n-propylene,<br>
iso-propyiene (-CH2CH(CH3)- and -CH(CH3)CHr) and the like.<br>
[0085] The term "lower alkynyl" refers to an alkynyl group preferably<br>
having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having at least 1 site and preferably<br>
only 1 site of alkynyl unsaturation (i.e., -OC). This term is exemplified by<br>
groups such as acetyl (-OCH), propargyl (-CH2-OCH), 3-butynyl (-<br>
CH2CH2OCH3) and the like.<br>
[0086] The term "lower cycloalkyl" refers to cyclic alkyl groups of from 3 to<br>
6 carbon atoms having a single cyclic ring including, by way of example,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
[0087] The term "lower alkylenecycloalkyl" refers to the group consisting of<br>
a lower alkylene-lower cycloalkyl, as defined herein. Such groups are<br>
exemplified by methylenecyclopropyl (-CH2-cyclopropyl),<br>
ethylenecyclopropyl and the like.<br>
[0088] "Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means a carrier that is useful in <br>
preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and<br>
neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier that is<br>
acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. "A<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used in the specification and claims<br>
includes both one and more than one such carrier.<br>
[0089] "Treating" or "treatment" of a disease includes:<br>
(1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the<br>
disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to<br>
the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease,<br>
(2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development<br>
of the disease or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
(3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its<br>
clinical symptoms.<br>
[0090] A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a<br>
compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is<br>
sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically<br>
effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its<br>
severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.<br>
[0091] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I which salts are derived from a<br>
variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and<br>
include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule<br>
contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as<br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate<br>
and the like.<br>
[0092] Integrins are a large family of homologous transmembrane linker<br>
proteins that are the principal receptors on animal cells for binding most<br>
extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The<br>
integrins are heterodimers comprised of an a chain and a ß chain. To date,<br>
twenty different integrin heterodimers, made from 9 different a subunits and<br>
14 different ß subunits, have been identified. The term " a 4 integrins" refers<br>
to the class of heterodimer, enzyme-linked cell-surface receptors that contain<br>
the a 4 subunit paired with any of the ß subunits. VLA-4 is an example of an<br>
a 4 integrin, and is a heterodimer of the a 4 and ßt subunits, and is also<br>
referred to as a4 ß, integrin.<br>
Compound Preparation<br>
[0093] The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0095] When employed as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention<br>
are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These<br>
compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral,<br>
rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal.<br>
These compositions are effective by both injectable and oral delivery. Such<br>
compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art<br>
and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
[0096] This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of formula I-<br>
VII above associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making<br>
the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with<br>
an exciß1ent, diluted by an exciß1ent or enclosed within such a carrier which<br>
can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. The<br>
excipient employed is tyß1cally an exciß1ent suitable for administration to<br>
human subjects or other mammals. When the exciß1ent serves as a diluent, it<br>
can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier<br>
or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the<br>
form of tablets, ß1lls, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs,<br>
suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid<br>
medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the<br>
active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile<br>
injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
[0097] In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active<br>
compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the<br>
other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it<br>
ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active<br>
compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted<br>
by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation,<br>
e.g., about 40 mesh.<br>
[0098] Some examples of suitable exciß1ents include lactose, dextrose,<br>
sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate,<br>
alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The<br>
formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and<br>
suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-<br>
benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the<br>
invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed<br>
release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by<br>
employing procedures known in the art.<br>
[0099] The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form,<br>
each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10<br>
to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms"<br>
refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human<br>
subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity<br>
of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in<br>
association with a suitable pharmaceutical exciß1ent.<br>
[00100] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range<br>
and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It, will<br>
be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually<br>
administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant<br>
circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of<br>
administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and<br>
response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient"s symptoms, and<br>
the like.<br>
[00101] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal<br>
active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical exciß1ent to form a solid<br>
preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a<br>
compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation<br>
compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is<br>
dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be<br>
readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets,<br>
ß1lls and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit<br>
dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1<br>
to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
[00102] The tablets or ß1lls of the present invention may be coated or<br>
otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of<br>
prolonged action. For example, the tablet or ß1ll can comprise an inner<br>
dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an<br>
envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an<br>
enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit<br>
the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in<br>
release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or<br>
coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures<br>
of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose<br>
acetate.<br>
[00103] The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the<br>
present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by<br>
injection include aqueous solutions suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil,<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
[00104] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions<br>
and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents,<br>
or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may<br>
contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable exciß1ents as described supra.<br>
Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal resß1ratory<br>
route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases.<br>
Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or<br>
the nebulizing device may be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent<br>
positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder<br>
compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices<br>
which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>

and emulsifying wax are incorporated and stirred until dissolved. The active<br>
ingredient is added and stirring is continued until dispersed. The mixture is<br>
then cooled until solid.<br>
[00123] Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the<br>
present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such<br>
transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous<br>
infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts.<br>
The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such<br>
patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery<br>
of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[00124] Direct or indirect placement techniques may be used when it is<br>
desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the<br>
brain. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery<br>
catheter into the host"s ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier.<br>
One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological<br>
factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,011,472 which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[00125] Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve<br>
formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the<br>
conversion of hydrophilic drugs into liß1d-soluble drugs. Latentiation is<br>
generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and<br>
primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid<br>
soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier.<br>
Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by<br>
intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the<br>
blood-brain barrier.<br>
Utility<br>
[00126] The compounds of this invention inhibit, in vivo, adhesion of<br>
leukocytes to endothelial cells mediated at least in part by a4 integrins, where<br>
the a4 integrin is preferably VLA-4, by competitive binding to a4 integrins,<br>
preferably VLA-4. Accordingly, the compounds of this invention can be<br>
used in the treatment of mammalian diseases mediated by a4 integrins, where<br>
the a4 integrin is preferably VLA-4, or leucocyte adhesion. Such diseases<br>
include inflammatory diseases in mammalian patients such as asthma,<br>
Alzheimer"s disease, atherosclerosis, AIDS dementia, diabetes (including<br>
acute juvenile onset diabetes), inflammatory bowel disease (including<br>
ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, tissue transplantation, tumor metastasis, meningitis, encephalitis,<br>
stroke, and other cerebral traumas, nephritis, retinitis, atopic dermatitis,<br>
psoriasis, myocardial ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury such<br>
as that which occurs in adult resß1ratory distress syndrome.<br>
[00127] The amount administered to the mammalian patient will vary<br>
depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the<br>
administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the<br>
manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications,<br>
compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in<br>
an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the<br>
disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is<br>
defined as "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use<br>
will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment<br>
of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the<br>
inflammation, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the<br>
like.<br>
[00128] The compositions administered to a patient are in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be<br>
sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered.<br>
The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or<br>
lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile<br>
aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound<br>
preparations tyß1cally will be between 3 and 11. more preferably from 5 to 9<br>
and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of<br>
the foregoing exciß1ents, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of<br>
pharmaceutical salts.<br>
[00129] The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention<br>
will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the<br>
treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health<br>
and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.<br>
For example, for intravenous administration, the dose will tyß1cally be in the<br>
range of about 20 µg to about 500 µg per kilogram body weight, preferably<br>
about 100 µg to about 300 µg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage<br>
ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.1 pg to 1 mg per<br>
kilogram body weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from<br>
dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>

illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the<br>
scope of this invention. Unless otherwise stated, all temperatures are in<br>
degrees Celsius.<br>

2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)proß1onic acid, (30.6 g, 0.129 mol) inTHF<br>
(250 mL) at -10 °C was added 2,4-DichIoro-5-nitropyrimidine (25g, 0.129<br>
mol), keeß1ng the temperature below 5 °C during the addition. Once the<br>
addition was complete, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (33.7 mL, 0.194 mol)<br>
was added dropwise. After stirring for 1 h at -10 °C, diethylamine (66.73<br>

citric acid (3 x 150 mL), water (1 x 150 mL), and 10% K2CO3 (3 x 150 mL).<br>
The organic phase was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to<br>
yield a yellow residue. The residue was purified by flash chromatography<br>
(20% EtOAc/hexanes on silica gel) to yield 37.39 g (67%) the title<br>
compound as a yellow foam. Rf=0.21 (25% EtOAc/hexanes on silica gel).<br>

(600 mL) was added DMAP (9.00 g, 0.074 mol). Afl:er 5 minutes<br>
triethylamine (10.23 mL, 0.074 mol) was added dropwise. N,N-<br>
dimethylcarbamyl chloride (13.83 mL, 0.110 mol) was added dropwise, and<br>
the reaction was heated to reflux overnight. The reaction mixture was<br>
concentrated in vacuo and taken up in EtOAc (1 L). The organic phase was<br>
washed with 0.5 M citric acid (3 x 250 mL), sat. NaHCO3 (3 x 250 mL),<br>
brine (1 x 250 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to<br>
yield 37.0 g (99%) the title compound as a white solid.<br>
[00136] Step 4: Preparation of 2-(2-diethylamiuo-5-aminopyrimidin-4-<br>

dimethylcarbamoyl-oxyphenyl)propionic acid /-butyl ester(37.0 g, 0.073 mol)<br>
and 10% Pd/C (3.8 g, 10 wt% Pd) in EtOH (250 mL) was shaken under 60<br>
psi hydrogen until TLC (50% EtOAc/hexanes on silica gel) showed 100%<br>
conversion to product (48 hours). The reaction mixture was then filtered<br>
through a Celite plug and concentrated in vacuo to yield 32.0 g (92%) the<br>
title compound as a violet foam.<br>
[00137] Step 5: Preparation of 2-{2-diethylamino-5-[(4-<br>
fluorobenzenesulfonyl) amino]-pyrimidin-4-ylamino}-3-(4-<br>
dimethylcarbamoyloxyphenyl) propionic acid /-butyl ester. A pyridine<br>
(120 mL) solution of 2-(2-diemylanamo-5-aminopyrimidin-4-ylarnino)-3-(4-<br>
dimethylcarbamoyloxy-phenyOpropionic acid /-butyl ester(32.0 g, 0.067 mol)<br>
was cooled to -20 °C with a dry ice/CH3CN bath. The mixture stirred for 30<br>
minutes, and then p-fluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (13.18 g, 0.067 mol) was<br>
added slowly. The reaction was stirred at -20 °C for 4.5 his, and then 3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl amine (8.52 mL, 0.067 mol) was added, and then the<br>
mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The reaction<br>
was concentrated in vacua. The residue was taken up in EtOAc (1 L), and<br>

Example A<br>
a4ß1 Iategrin Adhesion Assay:<br>
Jurkat™ Cell Adhesion to Human Plasma Fibronectin<br>
Procedure:<br>
[00170] 96 well plates (Costar 3590 EIA plates) were coated with human<br>
fibronectin (Gibco/BRL, cat #33016-023) at a concentration of 10 /Ag/mL<br>
overnight at 4°C. The plates were then blocked with a solution of bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA; 0.3%) in saline. Jurkat™ cells (maintained in log phase<br>
growth) were labeled with Calcein AM according to the manufacturer"s<br>
instructions, and suspended at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL in<br>
Hepes/Saline/BSA. The cells were then exposed to test and control<br>
compounds for 30 minutes at room temperature before transfer to individual<br>
wells of the fibronectin coated plate. Adhesion was allowed to occur for 35<br>
minutes at 37°C. The wells were then washed by gentle aspiration and<br>
pipetting with fresh saline. Fluorescence associated with the remaining<br>
adherent cells was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader at EX 485/EM<br>
530.<br>
[00171] Cell cultures were prepared by first splitting the stationary phase<br>
Jurkat™ cells at 1:10 on day one, and 1:2 on day two to perform assay on<br>
day 3. The cells split 1:10 on day one were split 1:4 on day 3 for a day 4<br>
assay.<br>
[00172] The assay plates were prepared by first making a working solution<br>
of Gibco/BRL Human Fibronectin (cat # 33016-023) In PBS+ + , at 10<br>
µg/mL.<br>
A Costar 3590 EIA plate was then coated with 50 µL/well for 2 hours at<br>
room temperature (thought it can also be left overnight at 4 °C). Finally the<br>
plate was asperated and blocked with Hepes/Saline Buffer, 100 µL/well, for 1<br>
hour at RT followed by washing three times with 150 µL of PBS+ +.<br>
[00173] Compound dilutions were accomplished by preparing 1:3 serial<br>
dilutions of compounds as follows. For each plate (4 compounds/plate) 600<br>
µL were added to 4 Bio-Rad Titertubes in a Titertube rack. Enough<br>
compound was added to each appropriate tube to give a 2X concentration<br>
using methods well known in the art. Using Falcon Fiexiplates, 100 µL of<br>
Hepes/Saline buffer or human serum were added to rows B through G. A<br>
multi-channel pipetter set to 180 µL was used to with four tips spaced evenly<br>
the pipetter. Each set of four tubes was mixed 5 times and 180 µL of 2X<br>
compound was transferred to the first column of each compound dilution in<br>
Row B, leaving Row A empty. 180 µL were added to the other wells in Row<br>
A. Serial dilutions were performed down the plate by transferring 50 µL to<br>
the next dilution and mixing 5 times, changing tips each time after mixing.<br>
Dilutions were stopped at Row F. Row G had no compound present.<br>
[00174] A 20 µg/mL solution in Hepes/Saline buffer or human serum, of<br>
21/6 antibody was the positive control and was set aside in a reagent trough<br>
to add to cell suspension plate.<br>
[00175] The cell staining was accomplished by first harvesting the log-phase<br>
Jurkat™ cells by centrifugation in 50 mL tubes (1100 rpm for 5 minutes).<br>
The cells were resuspended in 50 mL PBS + +, spun, and resuspend in 20<br>
mL PBS+ +. The ceils were stained by adding 20 µL of Calcein AM for 30<br>
minutes R.T. The volume was brought to 50 mL with Hepes/Saline buffer<br>
and the cells were counted, spun, and resuspend to 2 x 106 cells/mL in<br>
Hepes/Saline buffer or human serum.<br>
[00176] The compounds were incubated using the following procedure. In<br>
a new flexiplate, 65 µL of stained cells were added to Rows B through H.<br>
Then 65 pL of 2X compounds were added to the appropriate rows following<br>
the plate setup and mixed 3X. 65µL of 2X-21/6 antibody were added to<br>
Row H and mixed 3X. Finally the plate was incubated at room temperature<br>
for 30 minutes.<br>
[00177] Fibronectin adhesion was measured using a fluorescent plate reader<br>
at EX 485/EM 530 after the following work up procedure. After incubation,<br>
the cells were mixed 3X and 100 µL were transferred to the Fibronectin<br>
coated plates and incubated at 37 °C for about 35 minutes. Each plate was<br>
washed, row by row, by gently pipetting 100 µL of R.T. PBS+ + down the<br>
sides of the wells and turning the plate 90 degrees to aspirate. This procedure<br>
was repeated for a total of 3 washes. Each well was filled with 100 µL after<br>
washing by pipetting down the side of the well.<br>
[00178] An IC50 value was calculated for each compound, both in the<br>
presence of the human serum and in the absence of human serum. IC50 is<br>
concentration at which the growth or activity is inhibited by 50%. The data is<br>
presented in the following tables.<br>

Example B<br>
In vitro Saturation Assay For Determining Binding of<br>
Candidate Compounds to a4ß1p,<br>
[00181] The following describes an in vitro assay to determine the plasma<br>
levels needed for a compound to be active in the Experimental Autoimmune<br>
Encephalomyelitis ("EAE") model, described in the next example, or in other<br>
in vivo models.<br>
[00182] Log-growth Jurkat cells are washed and resuspended in normal<br>
animal plasma containing 20 µg/mL of the 15/7 antibody (Yednock, et al.,J.<br>
Biol. Chem., (1995) 270(48):28740).<br>
[00183] The Jurkat cells are diluted two-fold into either normal plasma<br>
samples containing known candidate compound amounts in various<br>
concentrations ranging from 66 µM to 0.01 µM, using a standard 12 point<br>
serial dilution for a standard curve, or into plasma samples obtained from the<br>
peripheral blood of candidate compound-treated animals.<br>
[00184] Cells are then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature,<br>
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline ("PBS") containing 2% fetal<br>
bovine serum and lmM each of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride<br>
(assay medium) to remove unbound 15/7 antibody.<br>
[00185] The ceils are then exposed to phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab")2<br>
anti-mouse IgG Fc (Immunotech, Westbrook, ME), which has been adsorbed<br>
for any non-specific cross-reactivity by co-incubation with 5% serum from<br>
the animal species being studied, at 1:200 and incubated in the dark at 4°C<br>
for 30 minutes.<br>
[00186] Cells are washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in the<br>
same. They are then analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell<br>
sorter ("FACS") analysis as described in Yednock et al. J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
1995, 270:28740.<br>
[00187] The data is then graßhed as fluorescence versus dose, e.g., in a<br>
normal dose-response fashion. The dose levels that result in the upper<br>
plateau of the curve represent the levels needed to obtain efficacy in an in<br>
vivo model.<br>
[00188] This assay may also be used to determine the plasma levels needed<br>
to saturate the binding sites of other integrins, such as the a9ß1 pi integrin,<br>
which is the integrin most closely related a4ß1 (Palmer et al, 1993, J. Cell<br>
Bio., 123:1289). Such binding is predictive of in vivo utility for<br>
inflammatory conditions mediated by a9ß1, integrin, including by way of<br>
example, airway hyper-responsiveness and occlusion that occurs with chronic<br>
asthma, smooth muscle cell proliferation in atherosclerosis, vascular<br>
occlusion following angioplasty, fibrosis and glomerular scarring as a result<br>
of renal disease, aortic stenosis, hypertrophy of synovial membranes in<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammation and scarring that occur with the<br>
progression of ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease.<br>
[00189] Accordingly, the above-described assay may be performed with a<br>
human colon carcinoma cell line, SW 480 (ATTC #CCL228) transfected with<br>
cDNA encoding a9 integrin (Yokosaki et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
269:26691), in place of the Jurkat cells, to measure the binding of the a9ß1<br>
integrin. As a control, SW 480 cells which express other a and ß1 subunits<br>
may be used.<br>
[00190] Accordingly, another aspect of this invention is directed to a method<br>
for treating a disease in a mammalian patient, which disease is mediated by<br>
a9ß1, and which method comprises administering to said patient a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. Such<br>
compounds are preferably administered in a pharmaceutical composition<br>
described herein above. Effective daily dosing will depend upon the age,<br>
weight, condition of the patient which factors can be readily ascertained by<br>
the attending clinician. However, in a preferred embodiment, the compounds<br>
are administered from about 20 to 500 µg/kg per day.<br>
Example C<br>
Cassette Dosing and Serum Analysis<br>
for determination of Bioavailability<br>
[00191] The oral bioavailability was screened by dosing rats with a cassette,<br>
i.e. mixture of 6 compounds per dosing solution. The cassette included 5 test<br>
articles and a standard compound, for a total dose of 10 mg/kg. Each<br>
compound/test article was converted to the sodium salt with equimolar 1 N<br>
NaOH and dissolved in water at 2 mg/mL. The cassette was prepared by<br>
mixing equal volumes of each of the six solutions. The cassette dosing<br>
solution was mixed well and then the pH was adjusted to 7.5-9. The dosing<br>
solution was prepared the day before the study and stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature.<br>
[00192] Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats from Charles River Laboratories, 6-<br>
8 weeks old were used in this screen. Rats were quarantined for at least one<br>
day and had continuous access to food and water. On the night before the<br>
administration of the cassette, the rats were fasted for aßproximately 16 h.<br>
[00193] Four SD rats were assigned in each cassette. A single dose of the<br>
dosing solution was administered orally to each rat. The dosing volume (5<br>
mL/kg) and time were recorded and rats were fed 2 h after dosing.<br>
[00194] Blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture at the following<br>
time points: 4 h, 8 h and 12 h. Immediately prior to blood collection, rats<br>
were anesthetized with CO2 gas within 10-20 seconds. After the 12-hour<br>
samples were collected, the rats were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation<br>
followed by cervical dislocation.<br>
[00195] Blood samples were kept in heparinized microtainer tubes under<br>
sub-ambient temperature (4 °C) before they were processed. Blood samples<br>
were centrifuged (10000 rpm for 5 minutes) and plasma samples were<br>
removed and stored in a -20 °C freezer until analyzed for drug levels. Drug<br>
levels in the plasma were analyzed using the following protocol for direct<br>
plasma precipitation.<br>
[00196] The in vivo plasma samples were prepared in a 1.5 mL 96-well<br>
plate, by adding, in order, 100 µL of the test plasma, 150 µL of methanol,<br>
followed by vortexing for 10-20 seconds. 150 µL of 0.05 ng//µL of an<br>
Internal Standard in acetonitrile were added and vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[00197] The standard curve samples were prepared in a 1.5 mL 96-well<br>
plate, by adding, in order, 100 µL of control mouse plasma, followed by 150<br>
µL of methanol and vortexing for 10-20 seconds. 150 µL of 0.05 ng/µL of<br>
an Internal Standard in acetonitrile were added and vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
The samples were spiked with 0-200 ng (10 concentrations) of the compound<br>
of interest in 50% methanol to obtain a standard curve range of 0.5 ng/mL -<br>
2,000 ng/mL. Again, the sample was vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[00198] The samples were then spun for 20-30 minutes at 3000 rpm in an<br>
Eppendorf microfuge before 80-90% of supernatant was transferred into a<br>
clean 96-well plate. The organic solvent was then evaßorated until the<br>
samples were dry (under N2 at 40°C/ 30-60 min (ZymarkTurbovaß)).<br>
[00199] The residue was then dissolved in 200 - 600 L mobile phase (50%<br>
CH3OH/0.1% TFA). LC/MS/MS was then run using a PE-Sciex aßi-3000<br>
triple quadurpole mass spectrometer (SN0749707), Perkin-Elmer,<br>
Series200auto-sampler, and shimadzu 10A pump. Acquisition was done with •<br>
PE-Sciex Analyst (vl.l) and data analysis and quantification were<br>
accomplished using PE-Sciex Analyst (vl.l). A 5-50 µL sample volume<br>
was injected onto a reverse phase ThermoHypersil DASH-18 column<br>
(Keystone 2.0 x 20 mm, 5 µm, PN: 8823025-701) using a mobile phase of<br>
25% CH3OH, 0.1% TFA-100% CH3OH, 0.1% TFA. The run time was<br>
about 8 minutes at a flow rate of about 300 µL/minutes.<br>
[00200] The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear<br>
traßezoidal rule from t=0 to the last sampling time t, (see Handbook of Basic<br>
Pharmacokinetics, Wolfgang A. Ritschel and Gregory L. Kearns, 5th ed,<br>
1999).<br>
AUC0?tx = S((Cn + Cn+1)/2)) • (tn+1 - tr) [µg/mL)h]<br>
[00201] In the case of the cassette dosing paradigm, samples at 4, 8 and 12 h<br>
post extravascular dosing, the AUC was calculated from t = 0 to t = 12 h.<br>
The AUC°?12h values were calculated for each individual animal and the<br>
average AUC°?12h are reported in the table below.<br>
Example D<br>
Asthma Models<br>
[00203] Inflammatory conditions mediated by a4ß1 integrin include, for<br>
example, eosinophil influx, airway hyper-responsiveness and occlusion that<br>
occurs with chronic asthma. The following describes animal models of<br>
asthma that were used to study the in vivo effects of the compounds of this<br>
invention for use in treating asthma.<br>
Rat Asthma Model<br>
[00204] Following the procedures described by Chaßman et al, Am J. Resp.<br>
Crit. Care Med,. 153 4, A219 (1996) and Chaßman et al, Am. J. Resp. Crit<br>
Care Med 155:4, A881 (1997), both of which are incorporated by reference<br>
in their entirety. Ovalbumin (OA; 10 µg/mL) were mixed with aluminum<br>
hydroxide (10 mg/mL) and injected (i.p.) in Brown Norway rats on day 0.<br>
Injections of OA, together with adjuvant, were repeated on days 7 and 14.<br>
On day 21, sensitized animals were restrained in plastic tubes and exposed<br>
(60 minutes) to an aerosol of OA (10 mg/kg) in a nose-only exposure system.<br>
Animals will be sacrificed 72 hours later with pentobarbital (250 mg/kg,<br>
i.p.). The lungs were lavaged via a tracheal cannula using 3 aliquots (4 mL)<br>
of Hank"s solution (HBSS x 10, 100 mL; EDTA 100 mM, 100 mL; HEPES<br>
1 M, 25 mL; made up to 1 L with H20); recovered cells were pooled and the<br>
total volume of recovered fluid adjusted to 12 mL by addition of Hank"s<br>
solution. Total cells were counted (Sysmex microcell counter F-500, TOA<br>
Medical Electronics Otd., Jaßan) and smears were made by diluting<br>
recovered fluid (to aßproximately 106 cells/mL) and pipetting an aliquot (100<br>
µL) into a centrifuge (Cytospin, Shandon, U.K.). Smears were air dried,<br>
fixed using a solution of fast green in methanol (2 mg/mL) for 5 seconds and<br>
stained with eosin G (5 seconds) and thiazine (5 seconds) (Diff-Quick,<br>
Browne Ltd. U.K.) in order to differentiate eosinophils, neutrophils,<br>
macrophages and lymphocytes. A total of 500 cells per smear were counted<br>
by light microscopy under oil immersion (x 100). Compounds of this<br>
invention were formulated into a 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and 2%<br>
Tween80 suspension and administered orally to rats which had been<br>
sensitized to the allergen, ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited allergen-<br>
induced leucocyte accumulation in the airways of actively sensitized Brown<br>
Norway rats were considered to be active in this model.<br>
Mouse Asthma Model<br>
[00205] Compounds were also evaluated in a mouse model of acute<br>
pulmonary inflammation following the procedures described by, Kung et ai.,<br>
Am J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 13:360-365, (1995) and Schneider etal.,<br>
(1999). Am J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:448-457, (1999), which are each<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Female Black/6 mice (8-12 weeks<br>
of age) were sensitized on day 1 by an intraßeritoneal injection (i.p.) of 0.2<br>
mL ova/alum mixture containing 20 µg of ova (Grade 4, Sigma) and 2 mg<br>
inject Alum (pierce). A booster injection was administered on day 14. Mice<br>
are challenged on days 28 and 29 with aerosolized 1 % ova (in 0.9% saline)<br>
for 20 minutes. Mice are euthanized and bronchaveolar lavage samples (3<br>
mL) are collected on day 30, 48 hours post first challenge. Eosinophils were<br>
quantified by a FACs/FITC staining method. Compounds of this invention<br>
were formulated into a 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and 2% Tween80<br>
suspension and administered orally to mice which had been sensitized to the<br>
allergen, ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited allergen-induced leucocyte<br>
accumulation in the airways of actively sensitized C57BL/6 mice were<br>
considered to be active in this model.<br>
Sheep Asthma Model<br>
[00206] This model employs the procedures described by Abraham et al.,<br>
J.Clin, Invest, 93:776-787 (1994) and Abraham et al., Am J. Respir Crit<br>
Care Med 156:696-703 (1997), both of which are incorporated by reference<br>
in their entirety. Compounds of this invention have been evaluated by<br>
intravenous (saline aqueous solution), oral (2% Tween80, 0.5%<br>
carboxymethylcellulose), and aerosol administration to sheep which are<br>
hypersensitive to Ascaris suum antigen. Compounds which decrease the early<br>
antigen-induced bronchial response and/or block the late-phase airway<br>
response, e.g. have a protective effect against antigen-induced late responses<br>
and airway hyper-responsiveness ("AHR"), are considered to be active in this<br>
model.<br>
[00207] Allergic sheep which are shown to develop both early and late<br>
bronchial responses to inhaled Ascaris suum antigen were used to study the<br>
airway effects of the candidate compounds. Following topical anesthesia of<br>
the nasal passages with 2% lidocaine, a balloon catheter was advanced<br>
through one nostril into the lower esophagus. The animals were then<br>
incubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube through the other nostril with a<br>
flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope as a guide.<br>
[00208] Pleural pressure was estimated according to Abraham (1994).<br>
Aerosols (see formulation below) were generated using a disposable medical<br>
nebulizer that provided an aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter<br>
of 3.2 µm as determined with an Andersen cascade impactor. The nebulizer<br>
was connected to a dosimeter system consisting of a solenoid valve and a<br>
source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed<br>
into a plastic T-piece, one end of which was connected to the inspiratory port<br>
of a piston respirator. The solenoid valve was activated for 1 second at the<br>
beginning of the inspiratory cycle of the respirator. Aerosols were delivered<br>
at VT of 500 mL and a rate of 20 breaths/minute. A 0.5 % sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution only was used as a control.<br>
[00209] To assess bronchial responsiveness, cumulative concentration-<br>
response curves to carbachol was generated according to Abraham (1994).<br>
Bronchial biopsies were taken prior to and following the initiation of<br>
treatment and 24 hours after antigen challenge. Bronchial biopsies were<br>
preformed according to Abraham (1994).<br>
[00210] An in vitro adhesion study of alveolar macrophages were also<br>
performed according to Abraham (1994), and a percentage of adherent cells<br>
calculated.<br>
Aerosol Formulation<br>
[00211] A solution of the candidate compound in 0.5% sodium<br>
bicarbonate/saline (w/v) at a concentration of 30.0 mg/mL is prepared using<br>
the following procedure:<br>
Procedure:<br>
1. Add 0.5g sodium bicarbonate into a 100 mL volumetric flask.<br>
2. Add approximately 90.0 mL saline and sonicate until<br>
dissolved.<br>
3. Q.S. to 100.0 mL with saline and mix thoroughly.<br>
[00213] B. Preparation of 30.0 mg/mL Candidate Compound: 10.0 mL<br>
Procedure:<br>
1. Add 0.300 g of the candidate compound into a 10.0 mL volumetric flask.<br>
2. Add approximately 9.7 mL of 0.5% sodium bicarbonate / saline stock<br>
solution.<br>
3. Sonicate until the candidate compound is completely dissolved.<br>
4. Q.S. to 10.0 mL with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate / saline stock solution<br>
and mix thoroughly.<br>
Example E<br>
10-Day Toxicity Study on C57B6 Mice<br>
[00214] A 10-day study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of compounds<br>
of the present invention to female C57B6 mice. The compound was<br>
administered by gavage at five dose levels, 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30, 100,<br>
300 and 1000 mg/kg (mpk), with five mice in each dose level. The dose<br>
volume for all levels was 10 mL/kg. Dose solutions or suspensions were<br>
prepared in 2% Tween 80 in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and new<br>
dose solutions or suspensions were prepared every two - three days. In-life<br>
observations included body weights (study day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 11), daily<br>
cageside clinical observations (1-2/day) and periodic (study day -1, 2 and 9)<br>
functional observation battery.<br>
[00215] At termination, blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture<br>
for clinical pathology (hematology and clinical chemistry) and drug levels.<br>
The EDTA blood samples were analyzed for total white blood cell count, red<br>
blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH,<br>
MCHC), platelets and a WBC five part differential (neutrophil, lymphocytes,<br>
monocytes, eosinophils and basophils). Heparinized plasma samples were<br>
analyzed for alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline<br>
phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, protein, calcium, glucose, urea<br>
nitrogen, creatinine, cholesterol and triglycerides.<br>
[00216] After blood collection, the carcass was necropsied and organs (liver,<br>
spleen, kidneys, heart and thymus) were weighed. Tissue samples; brain,<br>
salivary glands, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal spleen, stomach,<br>
duodenum, ileum, colon and uterus/ovary, were collected and formalin fixed.<br>
Tissues from the vehicle control and 300 and 1000 mpk group animals were<br>
processed to H &amp; E stained glass slides and evaluated for histopathological<br>
lesions.<br>
[00217] Body weight changes, absolute and relative organ weights and<br>
clinical pathology results were analyzed for statistical significant differences<br>
compared to the vehicle controls by Dunnet"s multiple comparison test using<br>
Prism software. The functional observation battery results were analyzed for<br>
differences using the Dunnet"s, Fisher"s exact tests and dose trend effects by<br>
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel correlation test using SAS software.<br>
[00218] Using a conventional oral formulation, compounds of this invention<br>
would be active in this model.<br>
Example F<br>
Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Rats<br>
[00219] Adjuvant induced arthritis ("ALA") is an animal model useful in the<br>
study of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is induced by injecting M.<br>
tuberculosis in the base of the tail of Lewis rats. Between 10 and 15 days<br>
following injection, animals develop a severe, progressive arthritis.<br>
[00220] Generally, compounds are tested for their ability to alter hind paw<br>
swelling and bone damage resulting from adjuvant-induced edema in rats. To<br>
quantitate the inhibition of hind paw swelling resulting from AIA, two phases<br>
of inflammation have been defined: (1) the primary and secondary injected<br>
hind paw, and (2) the secondary uninjected hind paw, which generally begins<br>
developing about eleven days from the induction of inflammation in the<br>
injected paw. Reduction of the latter type of inflammation is an indication of<br>
immunosuppressive activity. Cf. Chang, Arth. Rheum., 20, 1135-1141<br>
(1977).<br>
[00221] Using an animal model of RA, such as AIA, enables one to study<br>
the cellular events involved in the early stages of the disease. CD44<br>
expression on macrophages and lymphocytes is up-regulated during the early<br>
development of adjuvant arthritis, whereas LFA-1 expression is up-regulated<br>
later in the development of the disease. Understanding the interactions<br>
between adhesion molecules and endothelium at the earliest stages of adjuvant<br>
arthritis could lead to significant advances in the methods used in the<br>
treatment of RA.<br>
