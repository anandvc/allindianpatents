[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND AND A PROCESS THEREOF",<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, c Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
205/MUMNP/2003                                   18 JUL 2006<br><br><br><br><br><br>
TARTRATE SALTS OF THIAZOLIDINEDIONE DERIVATIVE<br>
This invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical, to a process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical and to the use of the pharmaceutical in medicine.<br>
European Patent Application, Publication Number 0,306,228 relates to certain thiazolidinedione derivatives disclosed as having hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic activity. The compound of example 30 of EP 0,306,228 is 5-[4-[2-(N-memyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethdxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (hereinafter also referred to as "Compound (I)").<br>
International Patent Application, Publication Number WO94/05659 discloses certain salts of the compounds of EP 0,306,228 one of which is the tartrate salt. The preferred salt of WO94/05659 is the maleic acid salt.<br>
It has now been discovered that Compound (I) forms a novel tartrate salt (hereinafter also referred to as the "D(-) Tartrate") that is particularly stable and hence is suitable for bulk preparation and handling. The D(-) Tartrate also has a high melting point and possesses good bulk flow properties The D(-) Tartrate is therefore surprisingly amenable to large scale pharmaceutical processing and especially to large scale milling.-<br>
The novel form can be prepared by an efficient, economic and reproducible process particularly suited to large-scale preparation.<br>
The novel D(-) Tartrate also has useful pharmaceutical properties and in particular it is indicated to be useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)emoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione, D(-) tartrate salt or a solvate thereof.<br>
Suitably, the D(-) Tartrate is a moho-tartrate salt<br>
Mono tartrate salts also optionally comprise another monovalent salting ion such as an alkali metal or ammonium cation.<br>
In one favoured aspect, the D(-) Tartrate provides an infrared spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
In one favoured aspect, the D(-) Tartrate provides a Raman spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 2<br><br>
In one favoured aspect, the D(-) Tartrate provides an X-Ray powder diffraction partem (XRPD) substantially in accordance with Table 1 or Figure 3.<br>
In one favoured aspect, the D(-) Tartrate provides a Solid State 13C NMR spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 4.<br>
In one favoured aspect, the D(-) Tartrate provides a melting point in the range of from 180 to 1850C, such as 180 to 183 °C, for example 181.6 "C<br>
In a preferred aspect, the invention provides 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione, D(-) Tartrate salt, characterised in that it provides:<br>
(i) an infrared spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 1; and (ii) a Raman spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 2; and (iii) an X-Ray powder diffraction pattern (XRPD) substantially in accordance with Table 1 or Figure 3;and (iv) a Solid State 13C NMR spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 4.<br>
The present invention encompasses the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof isolated in pure form or when admixed with other materials. Thus in one aspect there is provided the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in isolated form.<br>
In a further aspect there is provided the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a purified form.<br>
In yet a further aspect there is provided the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in crystalline form.<br>
Also, the invention provides the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a solid pharmaceutically acceptable form, such as a solid dosage form, especially when adapted for oral administration.<br>
Moreover, the invention also provides the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form being particularly capable of being milled.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides the D(-) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form having good flow properties, especially good bulk flow properties..<br>
A suitable solvate is a hydrate.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof, characterised in that 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Compound (I)), or a salt thereof, preferably dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent, is reacted with a<br><br>
source of D(-) tartrate ion and thereafter, if required, a solvate of the resulting D(-) Tartrate is prepared; and the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof is recovered.<br>
A suitable reaction solvent is an alkanol, for example propan-2-ol or ethanol, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, a ketone, such as acetone,: an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or water, or an organic acid such as acetic acid; or a mixture thereof.<br>
Conveniently, the source of D(-) tartrate ion is D(-) tartaric acid. The D(-) tartaric acid is preferably added as a solid or in solution, for example in water or a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or propan-2-ol, or a mixture of solvents. An alternative source of D(-) tartrate ion is provided by a suitably soluble base salt of D(-) tartaric acid for example ammonium D(-) tartrate, or the D(-) tartaric acid salt of an amine, for example ethyl amine or diethylamine.<br>
The concentration of Compound (I) is preferably in the range 2 to 25% weight/volume, more preferably in the range 5 to 20%. The concentration of D(-) tartaric acid solutions are preferably in the range of 5 to 130% weight/volume.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the solvent, although any convenient temperature that provides the required product may be employed:<br>
Solvates, such as hydrates, of the D(-) Tartrate are prepared according to conventional procedures.<br>
Recovery of the required compound generally comprises crystallisation from an appropriate solvent or mixture of solvents, conveniently the reaction solvent, usually assisted by cooling. For example, the D(-) tartrate may be crystallised from an alcohol such as propan-2-ol or ethanol.   An improved yield of the salt may be obtained by evaporation of some or all of the solvent or by crystallisation at elevated temperature followed by controlled cooling, optionally in stages. Careful control of precipitation temperature may be used to improve the reproducability of the product form.<br>
Crystallisation can also be initiated by seeding with crystals of the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof but this is not essential.<br>
When the mono tartrate salt comprise another monovalent salting ion such as an alkali metal or ammonium cation the said ion is conveniently formed by reacting the mono tartrate salt with a solution of the chosen monovalent salting'<br><br>
ion for example a metal or ammonium ion. Alternatively Compound(I) may be treated with a mono tartrate salt of the said monovalent salting ion.<br>
Compound (I) is prepared according to known procedures, such as those disclosed in EP 0,306,228 and WO94/05659. The disclosures of EP 0,306,228 and WO94/05659 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
D(-) tartaric acid is a commerciallv available compound.<br>
When used herein the term "Tonset" is generally determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and has a meaning generally understood in the art, as for example expressed in Pharmaceutical Thermal Analysis, Techniques and Applications", Ford and Tirhmins, 1989 as  "The temperature corresponding to the intersection of the pre-transition baseline with the extrapolated leading edge of the transition".<br>
When used herein in respect of certain compounds the term "good flow properties" is suitably characterised by the said compound having a Hausner ratio of less than or equal to 1.5, especially of less than or equal to 1.25.<br>
"Hausner ratio" is an art accepted term.<br>
When used herein the term 'prophylaxis of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus' includes the treatment of conditions such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and gestational diabetes.<br>
Diabetes mellitus preferably means Type II diabetes mellitus.<br>
Conditions associated with diabetes include hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance and obesity. Further conditions associated with diabetes include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis, certain eating disorders, in particular the regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders associated with under-eating, such as anorexia nervosa, and disorders associated with over-eating, such as obesity and anorexia bulimia. Additional conditions associated with diabetes include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance.<br>
The complications of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus encompassed herein includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with the development of Type II diabetes including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease.<br><br>
As mentioned above the compound of the invention has useful therapeutic properties: The present invention accordingly provides the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof for use as an active therapeutic substance.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellirus, conditions associated with diabetes mellirus and certain complications thereof.<br>
The D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof may be administered per se or, preferably, as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable methods for formulating the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof are generally those disclosed for Compound (I) in the above mentioned publications.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
The D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof is normally administered in unit dosage form.<br>
The active compound may be administered by any suitable route but usually by the oral or parenteral routes. For such use, the compound will normally be employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in association with a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent and/or excipient, although the exact form of the composition will naturally depend on the mode of administration.<br>
Compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral, parenteral or topical administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, pastilles, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions, suppositories and transdermal devices. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art.<br>
Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include' starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include,<br><br>
for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
Solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the active compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum.<br>
Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the active compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active compound.<br>
As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.<br><br>
As used herein the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces compounds, compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use: for example the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable salt' embraces a veterinarily acceptable salt.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof, in a human or non-human mammal which comprises administering an effective, non-toxic, amount of D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof to a human or non-human mammal in need thereof.<br>
Conveniently, the active ingredient may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition hereinbefore defined, and this forms a particular aspect of the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
In the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof the D(-) Tartrate or a solvate thereof may be taken in amounts so as to provide Compound (I) in suitable doses, such as those disclosed in EP 0,306,228, WO94/05659 or W098/55122.<br>
No adverse toxicological effects are indicated in the above mentioned treatments for the compounds of the invention.<br>

The solid-state NMR spectrum of the product (Figure 4) was recorded on a Bruker AMX360 instrument operating at 90.55 MHz: The solid was packed into a 4 mm<br><br>
zirconia MAS rotor fitted with a Kel-F cap and rotor spun at ca. 10 kHz. The 13C MAS spectrum was acquired by cross-polarisation from Hartmann-Halin matched protons (CP contact time 3ms, repetition time 15 s) and protons were decoupled during acquisition using a two-pulse phase modulated (TPPM) composite sequence. Chemical shifts were externally referenced to the carboxylate signal of glycine at 176.4 ppm relative to TMS and were observed at:<br>
181.2,	179.0, 177.4, 174.7, 173.0, 158.2, 156.9, 150.3, 145.6, 144.7, 141.9,<br>

Properties of the D(-) Tartrate, recorded for the product of Example 4<br>
Solid State Stability of the D(-) Tartrate<br>
The solid state stability of the drug substance was determined by storing<br>
approximately 1.0 g of the material in a glass bottle at i) 40°C / 75% Relative<br>
Humidity (RH), open exposure, for 1 month and b) at 50°C, closed, for 1 month. The material was assayed by HPLC for final content and degradation products in bodi cases.<br>
a)	40°C / 75% RH: No significant degradation observed (HPLC assay 96% initial).<br>
b)	50°C:    No significant degradation observed (HPLC assay 98% initial).<br>
Flow Properties of the D(-) Tartrate:<br>
The ratio between the bulk density and the tapped bulk density (Hausner Ratio) of the D(-) Tartrate was determined using standard methods ("Pharmaceutics -The Science of Dosage Form Design", editor M. Aulton, 1988, published by:Churchill Livingstone). Hausner Ratio: 1.2<br>
Melting Point of the D(-) Tartrate<br>
The melting point of the D(-) Tartrate was determined according to the method described in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, USP 23, 1995,  "Melting range or temperature, Procedure for Class la", using a Buchi 545 melting point instrument. Melting Point: 181.6°C<br>
Tonset  of the  D(-) Tartrate<br>
The T0nset of the drug substance was determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry using a Perkin-Elmer DSC7 apparatus. ronset (10°C/minute, closed pan): 187 °C<br><br>
