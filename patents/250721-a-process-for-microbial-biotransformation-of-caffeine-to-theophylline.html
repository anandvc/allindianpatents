				<td>The present invention is related to " a process for microbial biotransformation of caffeine to theophylline". The main feature of the invention is the production of theophylline by microorganism at room temperature in a simple medium using caffeine as the starting material.<br>
Theophylline (C7H8N4O2) 3,7-Dihydro-1,3-dimethyl-lH-purine-2,6-dione; 1,3 dimethyl xanthine having molecular weight 180.17 is an alkaloid naturally present in tea.<br>
The importance of theophylline is because of it's structural similarity with purine base adenine which is an entity of the hereditary system of living organisms. Classical pharmacological studies have revealed that methyl xanthines possess various desirable pharmacological properties. Reference may be made to the work of Beavo,J.A., and Reifsnyder,D.H; Primary sequence of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isozymes and the design of selective inhibitors; Trends in Pharmacological Science.,1990, 11:150-155, which shows that methyl xanthines have the ability to inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Reference may be made to the work of Daly, J.W; Adenosine receptors: targets for future drugs. J.Medical chemistry.,1982,25:197-207, which shows the antagonistic receptor mediated actions of adenosine. In general the above mentioned pharmacological activities are reduced in derivatives that lack substituents at position 1 or contain substituents at position 7, as compared with the corresponding 1,3 dialkyl xanthines. Thus the order of potency of the naturally occurring methyl xanthines is theophylline&gt;caffeine&gt;theobromine. Therefore biotransformation of naturally occurring caffeine to more potent molecule viz; theophylline was the main objective of the present invention.<br>
Theophylline has been shown to possess therapeutic properties such as diuretic, cardiac stimulant, smooth muscle relaxant and has been successfully used for the treatment of asthma, apnea, diuretic and as a central nervous system stimulator. Theophylline shows bronchodilator effects, arising out of its ability for inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDEs) which catalyze the breakdown of cyclic AMP and GMP to 5' AMP and 5'GMP respectively. Inhibition of PDEs will lead to an accumulation of cyclic AMP and GMP thereby increasing the signal transduction through these pathways and leading to results in increased levels of cyclic AMP promoting smooth muscle relaxation. Besides its ability to stabilize mast cells other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of theophylline have been observed. Adenosine-stimulated release of mediators from mast cells, neutrophil activation, induction of 1L-1ß by 1L-1α, synthesis and release of TNF-α and cytokine release from T-lymphocytes are inhibited by Theophylline.<br>
The use of theophylline as drug for asthma, as diuretic and cardiac muscle stimulant is known. Recently the structural resemblance of theophylline to adenine is being made use of to venture into the possibilities of it's use as anti viral, anti cancerous, anti tumourous activity. It has been reported to have anti leukemia property as it inhibits δ-P110 enzyme. Reference may be made to the work of G.Menon, A.D.Ingle, R.P.Gude; Tumor regression of B16F10 Melanoma in vivo by prevention of neovascularisation; Study on Theophylline. Cancer Biotherapy and Radiopharmaceuticals. Vol 17, No. 2, 2002, which shows the possible activity of theophylline on in vivo angiogenesis leading to tumor regression.<br>
Reference may be made to I.L.Finar's; Organic Chemistry; Vol-2; Stereochemistry and the chemistry of natural products; Chapter-16, Purines and Nucleic acids, P-809, which refers to the commercial production of theophylline by chemical synthesis (Traube's method) for which the starting materials are dimethyl urea and ethyl cyanoacetate. The drawback of the above method of synthesis is that it uses alkali, nitrous acid, various solvents, hazardous chemicals, is time consuming and not eco- friendly.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Schwimmer. S, Kurtzman,JR, and Heftmann E: Caffeine metabolism by Penicillium roqueforti; Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 147, 109-113 (1971) wherein they have identified theophylline as the first product of the caffeine metabolism pathway by fungi. However the disadvantage of this work is the inability to accumulate theophylline in significant level and the work addresses only basic research.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of M.Hakil, S.Denis, G.Viniegra-Gonzalez and C.Augur; Degradation and product analysis of caffeine and related dimethylxanthines by filamentous fungi in Enzyme Microbial Technology 22:355-359; 1998, wherein they reported the caffeine metabolism by various filamentous fungi where they were able to utilize caffeine upto 60% but the product accumulation was very low.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Yasuhisa Asano, Toshihiro Komeda and Hideaki Yamada; Microbial production of Theobromine from caffeine; Biosci. Biotech. Biochem.; 57 (8), 1286-1289, 1993, wherein Pseudomonas putida No.352 has been used. However the product accumulated was theobromine, which shows lower pharmacological activity.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for microbial biotransformation of caffeine to theophylline, which obviates the drawbacks of the methods described above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to isolate microorganisms, which possess the capability of biotransforming caffeine to theophylline.<br>
