COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
AN ELECTRONIC DRIVE SYSTEM FOR TEXTILE MACHINES.<br>
VALAVANUR NARAYANASAMI SUBRAMANIAN JAYARAMAN, having his office at 303, Pacific Apartments, Swami Samarth Nagar, Andheri (W), Mumbai -<br>
400 053, Maharashtra, India, Indian.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention, and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
-1-<br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to an electronic drive system for textile machines.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to a drive system for textile yarn spinning machines such as ring spinning machines, airjet spinning machines, open end spinning machines used for spinning cotton, polyester or blended yarn and in which the speed ratio of spinning rollers is controlled electronically as desired and the said speed ration can also be varied instantly without stopping the machine.<br>
In the textile yarn spinning machine, spinning involves stretching or attenuating of a band of fibres and twisting them. For stretching the fibres a draft/stretch is to be created by rotating the spinning rollers at different speeds. For creating a draft the pair of feed rollers is required to be rotated at lower speed and the pair of delivery rollers is required to be rotated at higher speed. The stretch ration depends upon the speed ratio of these rollers. For example a band of fibres with say 5000 fibres in cross section, if required to spin, to say, 250 fibres in cross section of the yarn then the stretch ratio required will be 5000/250 = 20 and the speed ration required will also be 20, for which if speed of the pair of the feed rollers is say Im/'min, then speed of the pair of delivery rollers should be m/min or say if feed rollers run at 10 RPM the delivery rollers should run at 200 RPM then only the fibre band, due to this stretch / draft will become thinner by 20 times and a band with only 250 fibres in the cross section will be delivered as a final yarn.<br>
In the existing textile yarn spinning machines for changing the draft or speed ration, in order to achieve various yarn counts, various combinations or gear wheels in the gear drive are used. With change gears, the ration of input to output speeds and thereby the linear density is achieved (your count is the linear density of yarn expressed as Tex, Denier, English count, Woolen count etc.). Further in the existing machines the feed back from the delivery rollers is taken mechanically using ordinary gearing or differential gearing and additional speed is superimposed from another / separate motor.<br>
The main drawback in the existing system is that the changes in linear density of yarn (yam count) can be carried out only after stopping the machine, due to the mechanical gears and drives being used therein. The level of precision is also limited due to the change gears having teeth of range about 30 to 150 numbers, and least precision is achievable corresponding to + or - 1 tooth.<br>
Further in case of the production of slub yam, used for fancy dressing, the mean yam linear density changes depending upon the manner of slubs in 100 m, length of the slub and thickness of the slub. Therefore the machine needs to be stopped and started a few times, before the correct yarn density is reached.<br>
Due to gear drive and change gears maintenance cost is quite high and due to repeated stopping of the machine, production loss is quite high.<br><br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to obviate the above described drawbacks and limitations of the existing systems and to provide an electronic drive system for textile machines, wherein chafige gears are dispensed with and replaced by servodrive and servomotor with electronic controls working on feed back pulse obtained from delivery rollers, to achieve any variations in the speed of the feed rollers with reference to the speed of the delivery roller^<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an electronic drive system for textile yarn spinning machines wherein speed change can be carried our from the desktop, by using a computer, while the machine is running, without stopping the machine.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an electronic drive system for textile yam spinning machines which facilitate production of yarn of varying linear density and with multiple twist levels, which help in producing fancy fabrics.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an electronic drive system for textile yam spinning machines wherein level of precision is not limited, like + or -, one gear tooth, rather any precision is now possible as feed back is in the form of pulse from the speed of delivery rollers and there is now no gear. A further object of this invention is to provide an electronic drive system for textile yarn spinning machine wherein maintenance and machine stoppage is very low, thereby achieving higher production at optimized costs.<br>
1. Accordingly this invention provides an electronic drive system for textile machines such as Yam spinning machines comprising of a servo motor adopted for connecting to feed roller, an Encoder adopted for collecting feed back pulse from the delivery roller yarn speed, a pulse Processor connected to the said Encoder for multiplying / dividing the pulses received through the said Encoder by a desired factor / number, a motor drive connected to the said servo motor for controlling the speed of the said servo motor, proportionate to the input received through the said pulse processor, thereby driving the feed roller at a speed proportionate to the speed of delivery roller and making instantaneous changes to the speed ratio to produce thick and thin effects on the yarn.<br>
. The invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawing wherein:<br>
Fig.l: Shows in schematic block diagram an electronic drive system for textile yarn spinning machine, according to an embodiment of this invention.<br>
Figs. 2 &amp; 3: Shows in schematic block diagrams further details of the system according to akemate embodiments of this invention.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3 the electronic drive system comprises a servomotor (1) connected to feed roller (2) of the spinning machine. An encoder (3) is connected to<br><br>
delivery roller (4) of the spinning machine for giving feed back pulse to a pulse processor (5) connected to the said encoder on one side i.e. input side and to a motor drive (6) on the other side i.e. output side. The motor drive (6) in turn is connected to the servo motor (1).<br>
In order to achieve a desired linear density / yarn count, feed back pulse, proportional to delivery speed of the yam is obtained through an Encoder which is then multiplied / divided by a number called pulse multiplying factor, as per requirement through the pulse processor and is used to drive the servo motor connected to feed roller through motor drive based on this pulse out put, thus the servo motor runs at a speed directly proportional to the delivery roller speed at a desired speed ration giving the desired stretch to achieve desired linear density or yarn count. The speed ratio is controlled by the pulse multiply factor and which can be controlled very precisely without any limitations.<br>
An additional signal generator (7) may be provided and connected to the motor drive (6) for giving additional signals, in the form of an instantaneous analog voltage signal or a preset speed value pulse signal. This additional signal can be fed to the motor drive for changing the speed ratio, between the feed roller and delivery roller instantaneously, in order to produce a thick or thin part in the yam, along its length.<br>
The servo motor can be controlled by using suitable commands to the microprocessor / micro controller to increase or decrease the speed ratio and thereby the degree of stretch or attenuation. The additional commands given to the controller can multiply or divide the pulses intermittently to increase or decrease the speed of servo motor in order to deliver an uneven yarn i.e. thick yarn when servo motor is running at higher RPM and thin yarn when servo motor is running at lower RPM.<br>
As shown in Fig.2, speed out put A is used with pulse multiplier / divider to change yarn count or linear density and the out put B is introduced uniformly or randomly to produce periodic thick or thin yarn depending on out put A + B.<br>
Operation of the electronic drive system of this invention is very simple, servo motor is mechanically connected to feed roller of spinning machine and servo motor and drive are interconnected. The servo motor drive can take two inputs, one a constant pulse input from delivery roller through the Encoder, which is divided by a suitable number as desired and fed to servo motor to rotate at a suitable desired speed to a give a desired speed ratio and thereby the desired stretch or draft. The other input which is generally not constant, but periodical, with uniform or random time intervals and may be momentary. The two inputs are summed up by the motor drive and the net output is the sum of the two inputs. The second input can be analog or relays, operating preset values.<br>
The above description with reference to figures of the drawings is given just to understand the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br><br><br>
