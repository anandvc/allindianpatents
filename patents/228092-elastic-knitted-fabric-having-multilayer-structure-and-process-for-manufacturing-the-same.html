				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ELASTIC KNITTED FABRIC HAVING MULTILAYER STRUCTURE<br>
AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING THF SAMF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a circular<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a multilayer structure,<br>
made by binding front and back two ground knitted<br>
fabrics together with a binding yarn, a warp elastic<br>
knitted fabric, a process for manufacturing the same,<br>
and an apparatus for manufacturing the circular elastic<br>
knitted fabric of the present invention. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a three-layer structure<br>
with front and back two ground knitted fabrics bound<br>
together, or a three-dimensional structure having an<br>
air gap between front and back two ground knitted<br>
fabrics. That is, the present invention relates to an<br>
elastic knitted fabric having excellent stretchability,<br>
being dense, light and excellent in shape stability,<br>
being hard to be flattened even under repeated loads in<br>
the case of the three-dimensional elastic knitted<br>
fabric, having excellent compressibility and<br>
compression recoverability, and being excellent in air<br>
permeability and heat retaining property, a process for<br>
manufacturing the same, and a knitting apparatus.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Traditionally, usual yarns (yarns commonly<br>
used, such as a filament, false twist yarn or spun<br>
yarn) are often used as jointing yarns (binding yarns)<br>
for binding front and back faces together for three-<br>
dimensional structure knitted fabrics made using many<br>
types of weft knitting machines and warp knitting<br>
machines that have been proposed. These are mainly<br>
used for linings and the like of general materials and<br>
cloths, and have an effect of adding appropriate<br>
thermal insulation characteristics, but are poor in<br>
compressibility and compression recoverability.<br>
Furthermore, a three-dimensional structure<br>
knitted fabric using a heat seal yarn as a binding yarn<br>
is known in the art, and examples of the three-<br>
dimensional structure knitted fabrics include a knitted<br>
fabric described in JP-A-4-240252. This knitted fabric<br>
is a mold product utilizing formability of the heat<br>
seal yarn, and is suitable for pressure forming such as<br>
heat press adequate; for the formability, but has almost<br>
no compressibility and compression recoverability, and<br>
flattening resistance or the like under repeated loads<br>
is not considered.<br>
Furthermore, for the example of a knitted<br>
fabric described in JP-A-7-316959, a circular<br>
corrugated knit using a connecting yarn in combination<br>
with a heat seal yarn and a highly crimped yarn is<br>
proposed. Use of polyurethane and the like in the<br><br>
connecting yarn is described in this publication.<br>
Furthermore, a three-dimensional knitted fabric using a<br>
binding yarn in combination with a heat seal yarn and a<br>
stretchable yarn (polyurethane based elastic fibers,<br>
etc.) is described in JP-A-2001-164444. They are to<br>
provide a cushioning property with the highly crimped<br>
yarn and the stretchable yarn and reduce flattening<br>
under repeated loads, but has a problem such that when<br>
the heat seal yarn is used in the connecting yarn, the<br>
low softening point of the heat seal yarn causes<br>
creases to occur in a substrate during dyeing<br>
processing and the like, the creases are not eliminated<br>
after finishing, and the heat seal yarn as a connecting<br>
yarn is heat-sealed to fix the front and back knitted<br>
fabrics, so that the knitted fabric as a whole has<br>
almost no stretchability, exhibits neither cushioning<br>
property nor flattening resistance by the effects of<br>
the highly crimped yarn and the stretchable yarn, is<br>
poor in compressibility and compression recoverability,<br>
and is flattened under repeated loads. Further, non-<br>
elastic fibers used in the connecting yarn and the<br>
ground knitted fabric are heat-sealed, so that the<br>
knitted fabric as a whole becomes rigid, and although<br>
finding some application for industrial materials, it<br>
is not suitable at all as a general material or sub-<br>
material worn by a person or used at a location close<br>
to a skin, and cannot be practically used in this<br>
field.<br><br>
On the other hand, as a similar product, a<br>
three-layer structure knitted fabric manufactured by a<br>
double raschel machine, which is one type of warp<br>
knitted fabric, is commercially available. This<br>
knitted fabric uses a monofilament as a binding yarn.<br>
Use of the monofilament is intended for improving the<br>
cushioning property by means of its high degree of<br>
elasticity. However, this three-dimensional structure<br>
knitted fabric is rigid as a whole due to stiffness of<br>
the monofilament, and is therefore unsuitable as a<br>
fabric worn by a person as in the case described above.<br>
JP-A-5-106146 describes a process of<br>
connecting one knitted fabric and the other knitted<br>
fabric with an elastic yarn, and using methods such as<br>
the increasing/decreasing of knitting courses<br>
achievable only by a flatbed knitting machine and<br>
partial knitting to knit a highly rugged and firm<br>
knitted fabric. However, the flatbed knitting machine<br>
has a rough gage, and therefore requires that several<br>
strings of yarn having a large size, for example bulky<br>
wool yarn or highly crimped thick synthetic fiber long<br>
finished yarn should be arranged for knitting, and the<br>
knitted fabric thus formed is a sweater or the like<br>
having rough stitches, and a dense and light knitted<br>
fabric desired in the present invention cannot be<br>
obtained. Furthermore, a stable shape cannot be<br>
retained even when the thickness of the binding yarn is<br>
increased because of the rough gage, and the warp and<br><br>
weft elongation balance of the knitted fabric is not<br>
satisfactory. Furthermore, the prior art has<br>
technological ideology of a method of three-<br>
dimensionally knitting a fabric along a silhouette of a<br>
human body, but has no concept of providing the knitted<br>
fabric itself with a three-dimensional structure having<br>
an air gap. Further, the flatbed knitting machine has<br>
a fatal problem such that a yarn feeding port travels<br>
to and fro along with a carriage, and a yarn is fed<br>
from the yarn feeding port and a knitting motion is<br>
repeated, but when an elastic yarn is knitted, the draw<br>
ratio varies along the width direction if using a bare<br>
string, thus making it impossible to obtain uniform<br>
stitches. Thus, it is common sense among those skilled<br>
in the art that no bare string is used, but so called a<br>
covering finished yarn with non-elastic fibers<br>
previously wound around a bare string of elastic yarn<br>
is used.<br>
Furthermore, EP Patent Publication No. 431984<br>
describes a knitted fabric for cloths allowing water in<br>
the body to be easily transpired to outside, having two<br>
knitted fabrics connected together with an elastic<br>
yarn, with the back face constituted by water repellent<br>
fibers alone and the front face constituted by water<br>
absorptive fibers and a platting-knitted elastic yarn.<br>
The purpose of using an elastic yarn for the front<br>
knitted fabric is to make stitches of the front knitted<br>
fabric denser to prevent the entrance of the outside<br><br>
air into the knitted fabric, and the technique is<br>
different from the present invention in both<br>
technological challenge and purpose. In the knitted<br>
fabric having this configuration, curling tends to<br>
occur because the front face and the back face have<br>
different degrees of stretchability, but use of an<br>
elastic yarn for the back face to add stretchability is<br>
not acceptable in view of its purpose. Specifically,<br>
if the elastic yarn is used for the back face to make<br>
the stitches denser in this knitted fabric, water in<br>
the body cannot be transferred through the knitted<br>
fabric, thus making it impossible to transpire water to<br>
the outside. Therefore, in the knitted fabric having<br>
this configuration, occurrence of curling cannot be<br>
inhibited, and a trouble arises in forming the knitted<br>
fabric into a cloth.<br>
Furthermore, traditionally, when a bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers is knitted<br>
by a circular knitting machine, all spandex based<br>
elastic fibers on the knitting machine can be fed to<br>
the knitting machine only at a same rate due to<br>
machine-related restriction, and if different weaves<br>
are to be knitted with polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers, they can be knitted only at the feed speeds<br>
relatively close to each other. As a result,<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers suffer yarn breakage<br>
due to excessive drawing and fault drawing from a<br>
package of fibers due to insufficient drawing when the<br><br>
fibers are knitted. Consequently, weave-related<br>
restriction is significant, and knitting conditions are<br>
limited, so that the knitted fabric becomes too dense,<br>
and adequate stretchability cannot be obtained.<br>

an elastic knitted fabric having a three-layer<br>
structure with front and back two ground knitted<br>

knitted fabric having excellent stretchability, being<br>
dense, light and excellent in shape stability, having a<br>
soft feel, and being most suitable for cloths worn by a<br>
person or used at a location close to the skin, general<br>
materials and sub-materials.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be described in<br>
detail below.<br>
In an elastic knitted fabric having a<br>
multilayer structure of the present invention, front<br>
and back ground knitted fabrics denoted by reference<br><br>
numerals 16 and 17 in FIGs. 1 and 7 and reference<br>
numerals 18 and 19 in FIGs. 2 and 8 are independently-<br>
formed, and a binding yarn for binding the above<br>
described both ground knitted fabrics, denoted by<br>
reference numeral 3 in FIG. 1 and reference numeral 6<br>
in FIG. 2, is made by only a bare string (s) of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers. The binding yarn<br>
for binding both the ground knitted fabrics is a bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers, so that<br>
excellent stretchability can be added to a bound<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a multilayer structure<br>
without restricting elongation in warp and weft<br>
directions. The size of the bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers for use in the<br>
present invention is 17 to 3000 decitexes.<br>
Further, for describing a preferred aspect of<br>
the present invention, an elastic knitted fabric of<br>
such a preferred aspect consists of the following three<br>
structures.<br>
For the first preferred structure, separate<br>
front and back ground knitted fabrics are each<br>
independently formed by each needle bed of a circular<br>
knitting machine having two needle beds as shown in a<br>
loop structure diagram in FIG. 1. Both the ground<br>
knitted fabrics are bound together with only a bare<br>
string(s) of polyurethane based elastic fibers but in<br>
this case, the binding yarn is bound by a tuck loop to<br>
at least one of the ground knitted fabrics. By<br><br>
increasing the feed speed of the binding yarn, a three-<br>
dimensional structure having an air gap between front<br>
and back two ground knitted fabrics is formed. The<br>
binding yarn denoted by reference numeral 3 in FIG. 1<br>
is bound to 25% or more of stitches of one of the front<br>
and back ground knitted fabrics having a lower stitch<br>
density, the ratio of the loop length of the binding<br>
yarn made of polyurethane based elastic fibers to the<br>
loop length of any one of the above described separate<br>
front and back circular knitted fabrics having a<br>
smaller loop length is in a range of 0.6 to 2.3. This<br>
is because by making the ratio of the loop length of<br>
the binding yarn to the loop length of the ground<br>
knitted fabric relatively large, the front and back two<br>
ground knitted fabrics are bound together with<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers to form a three-<br>
dimensional structure having an air gap therein as<br>
shown by reference numeral 3 in FIG. 7. If this ratio<br>
(T) is smaller than 0.6, a problem may arise in terms<br>
of compressibility, recoverability and knitting<br>
characteristics of the obtained three-dimensional<br>
knitted fabric. The ratio (T) is preferably equal to<br>
or smaller than 2.3 in obtaining a three-dimensional<br>
knitted fabric having a good feel, and if the ratio is<br>
greater than 2.3, a bare string of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers may protrude from the front and back<br>
knitted fabrics to compromise the quality of the<br>
knitted fabric. In the present invention, the binding<br><br>
of ground knitted fabrics with a bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers is performed by tuck<br>
knitting with at least one of the front and back ground<br>
knitted fabrics, but as for the number of bindings, the<br>
string is preferably bound to 25% or more of stitches<br>
of one of the front and back ground knitted fabrics<br>
having a lower stitch density.<br>
The size of a bare string of polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers to be used is preferably in a<br>
range of 33 to 3000 decitexes, more preferably 70 to<br>
2000 in terms of the three-dimensional shape retaining<br>
property, recoverability from compression and<br>
resistance to flattening by repeated fatigues. If the<br>
size is smaller than 33 decitexes, the three-<br>
dimensional shape cannot be retained in the three-<br>
dimensional structure elastic knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention with a weak shearing force, and it<br>
may be impossible to obtain satisfactory recoverability<br>
from compression. If the size increases to more than<br>
3000 decitexes, the weight of the elastic knitted<br>
fabric itself may become too large for use in cloths<br>
and the like.<br>
Furthermore, the break elongation of the bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers is<br>
preferably 400 to 1100%, and the dry heat processing<br>
temperature for presetting or the like during dyeing is<br>
preferably around 190°C so that stretchability is not<br>
compromised.<br><br>
In the present invention, for the method for<br>
binding ground knit fabrics with a bare string(s) of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers, one side may be<br>
bound by a tuck loop and the other side may be bound by<br>
a knit loop, but both the ground knitted fabrics are<br>
preferably tuck-bound for obtaining a stretchable<br>
knitted fabric having a bare string(s) of polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers bound without affecting front and<br>
back knitted fabrics, allowing promotion of reduction<br>
in the thickness of the ground knitted fabric, having<br>
excellent elongation recoverability, having a good<br>
feel, and being excellent in form stability and surface<br>
quality.<br>
Furthermore, if non-elastic fibers are<br>
contained in a binding yarn for binding front and back<br>
ground knitted fabrics together, compressibility or<br>
compression recoverability and the feel are<br>
compromised.<br>
The method for knitting a bare string(s) of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers for use as a binding<br>
yarn is not limited, but for obtaining good fabric<br>
thinness feeling and elongation recoverability, zigzag<br>
binding in which the binding ratio of the ground<br>
knitted fabric to the number of stitches is 50% is<br>
preferable because an appropriate air gap is retained<br>
between front and back ground knitted fabrics and the<br>
three-dimensional shape is excellently retained.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that both the ground<br><br>
knitted fabrics are tuck-bound and the number of<br>
bindings to the front weave equals the number of<br>
bindings to the back weave because the surfaces of the<br>
front and back ground knitted fabrics of the elastic<br>
knitted fabric are flattened.<br>
The term "having a three-dimensional<br>
structure" in the present invention means that front<br>
and back two ground knitted fabrics are substantially<br>
in a non-contact state, and the front and back two<br>
ground knitted fabrics are column-wise supported by a<br>
bare string(s) of polyurethane elastic fibers to retain<br>
an air gap between the two ground knitted fabrics.<br>
An example of a process for manufacturing an<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a three-dimensional<br>
structure of the present invention will now be<br>
described.<br>
As a knitting machine, the so-called double<br>
knit circular knitting machine having a normal two-row<br>
needle bed, which preferably has a large number of yarn<br>
feeding ports and a feeder capable of feeding a<br>
plurality of strings at a time, is preferably used.<br>
The gage of the knitting machine may be selected as<br>
appropriate according to an intended purpose, but a 18<br>
to 40 gage knitting machine is usually used. Other<br>
than the gage double knit circular knitting machine,<br>
for example, a 42 gage knitting machine may be used as<br>
a 21 gage-equivalent machine with a needle being drawn<br>
out on one-by-one basis. Furthermore, a circular<br><br>
knitting machine having a gage rougher than the 18 gage<br>
may be used but in this case, it is preferable that a<br>
bed having a gage rougher than the 18 gage is limited<br>
to one of a dial bed and a cylinder bed, and the other<br>
bed has a 18 gage or higher for obtaining a dense and<br>
light knitted fabric desired in the present invention.<br>
The thickness of the yarn used in front and<br>
back knitted fabrics, and denoted by reference numerals<br>
1 and 2 in FIG. 1 and reference numerals 4 and 5 in<br>
FIG. 2 is not specifically limited, but the gross size<br>
is preferably in a range of 22 to 1220 decitexes, more<br>
preferably 34 to 310 decitexes. The size of a single<br>
yarn is preferably in a range of 0.1 to 610 decitexes,<br>
more preferably 1 to 100 decitexes.<br>
The front and back ground knitted fabrics are<br>
not specifically limited, but they are preferably<br>
knitted weaves formed by one needle bed of a circular<br>
knitting machine, and are for example basic weaves of<br>
plain knitting, and derivative weaves of tuck knitting,<br>
float knitting, half cardigan stitch, lace knitting,<br>
platting knitting and the like.<br>
As shown in the loop structure diagram in<br>
FIG. 2, a second preferred structure in the present<br>
invention has a knitted weave similar to that of the<br>
first structure described above, but is characterized<br>
in that the binding yarn is bound to 25% or more of<br>
stitches of one of the front and back ground knitted<br>
fabrics having a lower stitch density, and the ratio of<br><br>
the loop length of the binding yarn constituted by<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers to the loop length of<br>
one of the above described separate front and back<br>
circular knitted fabrics having a smaller loop length<br>
is 0.2 to 0.6. The ratio of the loop length of the<br>
binding yarn constituted by polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers to the loop length of the ground knitted fabric<br>
consisting of a circular knitted structure is<br>
relatively small, and the front and back two ground<br>
knitted fabrics are bound together with polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers to form a three-layer structure.<br>
In this case, the size of a bare string of polyurethane<br>
base elastic fibers to be used is preferably in a range<br>
of 17 to 1500 decitexes, more preferably 22 to 640<br>
decitexes in terms of stretchability, the surface<br>
quality of the knitted fabric.<br>
Furthermore, the break elongation of the bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers is<br>
preferably 400 to 1100%, and the dry heat processing<br>
temperature for presetting or the like during dyeing is<br>
preferably around 190°C so that stretchability is not<br>
compromised. Furthermore, in the present invention,<br>
the ratio of the loop length of the bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers as a binding yarn to<br>
the loop length of one of front and back weft knitted<br>
fabrics having a smaller loop length, specifically the<br>
ratio to either the: loop length of cylinder stitches<br>
constituting one face or the loop length of dial<br><br>
stitches constituting the other face, which is smaller,<br>
is preferably 0.2 to 0.6, more preferably 0.2 to 0.5.<br>
If the ratio of the loop length of the bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers is smaller than 0.2,<br>
the elongation of elastic fibers in the knitted fabric<br>
increases, so that yearn breaking and degradation in<br>
the surface quality of the substrate occurs during<br>
knitting, and elastic fibers are easily drawn out of<br>
the end surface of the knitted fabric, and a problem<br>
may arise if it is repeatedly worn and elongated as a<br>
cloth. If the ratio of the loop length is greater than<br>
0.6, front and back knitted fabrics cannot be brought<br>
into close contact with each other, so that the fabric<br>
thinness is degraded, and the elongation of elastic<br>
fibers in the substrate drops so that elongation<br>
recoverability may be compromised. The ratio of the<br>
loop length described herein refers to the ratio of the<br>
length L-c in a relaxed state of the binding yarn to<br>
the length L-g of a yarn constituting the ground<br>
knitted fabric equivalent to one course deknitted and<br>
taken out from the knitted fabric having a fixed width<br>
(L-c/L-g).<br>
In this structure, the binding of ground<br>
knitted fabrics with a bare string(s) of polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers is performed by tuck-knitting with<br>
at least one of the front and back ground knitted<br>
fabrics. As for the number of bindings, the string is<br>
bound to 25% or more of stitches of one of the front<br><br>
and back ground knitted fabrics having a lower stitch<br>
density. For obtaining satisfactory fabric thinness<br>
feeling and elongation recoverability, zigzag binding<br>
in which the binding ratio of the ground knitted fabric<br>
to the number of stitches is 50% is superior and<br>
preferable. Furthermore, it is preferable that the<br>
binding of the binding yarn to both the front and back<br>
ground knitted fabrics is tuck binding, and the number<br>
of bindings to the front ground knitted fabric equals<br>
the number of bindings to the back ground knitted<br>
fabric because the appearance of a flat elastic knitted<br>
fabric is obtained.<br>
A third preferred structure in the present<br>
invention is a multilayer elastic warp knitted fabric<br>
made by binding together separate front and back ground<br>
knitted fabrics, characterized in that the above<br>
described two-layer ground knitted fabrics consist of a<br>
warp knitted structure, the ground knitted fabrics are<br>
bound with only a bare string(s) of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers of 17 to 3000 decitexes, and the binding<br>
yarn is bound to 25% or more of stitches of one of the<br>
front and back ground knitted fabrics having a lower<br>
stitch density.<br>
One example of the elastic warp knitted<br>
fabric of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The elastic warp knitted fabric can be knitted by a<br>
warp knitting machine having a two-row needle bed.<br>
That is, front and back two ground knitted fabrics 7<br><br>
and 8 of the elastic warp knitted fabric having a<br>
multilayer structure, of the present invention, has a<br>
warp knitted structure, and may be any of a chain-<br>
knitted fabric, a 1x1 tricot stitch fabric, a cord-<br>
knitted fabric, a mesh-knitted fabric and the like. It<br>
may be a combination of a broad stitch with the front<br>
knitted fabric and the back knitted fabric. The ground<br>
knitted fabrics can be connected together with only a<br>
bare string(s) of polyurethane based elastic fibers 9<br>
to obtain the elastic warp knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the present invention, the binding of<br>
ground knitted fabrics with a bare string (s) of<br>
polyurethane basesd elastic fibers may be knit loop<br>
binding or may be tuck loop binding. The former is<br>
preferable in the case of the three-layer warp knitted<br>
structure having a shape with front and back ground<br>
knitted fabrics bound together, and any of knit loop<br>
binding and tuck loop binding may be employed in the<br>
case of the three-dimensional structure having an air<br>
gap between front and back ground knitted fabrics. For<br>
the number of bindings, the binding yarn is bound to<br>
25% or more, preferably 50% or more, of stitches of one<br>
of front, and back ground knitted fabrics having a lower<br>
stitch density.<br>
The size of a bare string of polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers to be used is preferably in a<br>
range of 33 to 3000 decitexes, further preferably 70 to<br><br>
2000 decitexes in terms of the three-dimensional shape<br>
retaining property, recoverability from compression,<br>
resistance to flattening by repeated fatigues, and the<br>
like. If the size is smaller than 33 decitexes, the<br>
three-dimensional shape cannot be retained in the<br>
three-dimensional structure elastic knitted fabric of<br>
the present invention with a weak shearing force, and<br>
satisfactory recoverability from compression cannot be<br>
obtained. If the size increases to more than 3000<br>
decitexes, the weight of the elastic knitted fabric<br>
itself becomes too large for use in cloths and the<br>
like.<br>
In the present invention, at least one of<br>
front and back ground knitted fabrics preferably<br>
contains an elastic composite yarn for further<br>
improving the elastic knitted fabrics having the<br>
multilayer structures of the three types described<br>
above and meeting the object. The elastic composite<br>
yarn described here refers to yarns with polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers and non-elastic yarns combined in<br>
a variety of ways, which include, for example, a<br>
composite yarn covering-processed, for example, with<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers as a core and<br>
polyamide long fibers as a sheath, and a core spun yarn<br>
using polyurethane based elastic fibers as a core<br>
surrounded by short fibers such as cotton to form a<br>
spun yarn.<br>
By incorporating an elastic composite yarn in<br><br>
at least one of front and back ground knitted fabrics,<br>
stretchability can be added to the multilayer elastic<br>
knitted fabric of the present invention.<br>
Stretchability in the width direction of the knitted<br>
fabric by the binding yarn is supplemented, and<br>
stretchability can be also added in the length<br>
direction of the knitted fabric, so that a multilayer<br>
structure elastic knitted fabric having satisfactory<br>
stretchability in both warp and weft directions is<br>
provided. By making the stitch of the ground knitted<br>
fabric smaller and denser with a elongation recovery<br>
force of the elastic yarn, the connection yarn can be<br>
tightly bound thereto, thus making it possible to<br>
provide a stable multilayer structure. Furthermore, if<br>
the density of the entire ground knitted fabric is<br>
increased with the elastic yarn, the density of the<br>
connecting yarn is also increased, and a binding angle<br>
between the ground knitted fabric and the connecting<br>
yarn becomes closer to a right angle in the case of the<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a three-dimensional<br>
structure, resulting in an improvement in compression<br>
resilience and recovery rate.<br>
If the elastic composite yarn is knitted into<br>
one of front and back two ground knitted fabrics, the<br>
above-described effect can be obtained. It is<br>
preferable that the composite yarn is knitted into both<br>
the ground knitted fabrics, because the balance of the<br>
knitted fabric is improved in the front and back<br><br>
fabrics, and phenomena such as the so-called curling<br>
such that the ear part or end part of the knitted<br>
fabric is curled up can be eliminated. Furthermore,<br>
the elastic composite yarn may form the ground knitted<br>
fabric by itself, may be arranged with another non-<br>
elastic yarn to form stitches, or may be cross-knitted<br>
with the non-elastic yarn.<br>
In the elastic knitted fabric having a<br>
multilayer structure, of the present invention, the<br>
case will be described where both front and back ground<br>
knitted fabrics contain polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers as a bare string(s), and the bare string(s) of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers and the non-elastic<br>
yarn are arranged to form stitches. In this case, like<br>
the elastic knitted fabric containing the elastic<br>
composite yarn, stretchability can be added to the<br>
multilayer elastic knitted fabric. Stretchability in<br>
the width direction of the knitted fabric by the<br>
binding yarn can be supplemented, and stretchability<br>
can also be added in the long direction of the knitted<br>
fabric, so that a multilayer structure elastic knitted<br>
fabric having satisfactory stretchability in both warp<br>
and weft directions is provided. By making stitches of<br>
the ground knitted fabric smaller and denser with a<br>
elongation recovery force of the elastic yarn, the<br>
density of the binding yarn is increased, and a<br>
crossing angle (binding angle) between the ground<br>
knitted fabrics 16 and 17 and the binding yarn 3<br><br>
of the entire knitted fabric.<br>
The bare string of polyurethane elastic yarn<br>
described herein is a yarn produced in such a manner<br>
that a spinning stock solution is extruded into a<br>
spinning chamber through one or more spinnerets,<br>
i<br>
converged and fusion-bound in contact sites of single<br>
strings, for example, and wound up in a state of a<br>
monofilament on the surface, and a covered elastic yarn<br>
with the bare string covered with a non-elastic fiber<br>
multifilament or the like, and a core spun yarn spun<br>
with short fibers such as cotton are exceptions.<br>
The content of polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers (denoted by reference numerals 20 and 21 in FIG.<br>
1 and reference numerals 22 and 23 in FIG. 2, although<br>
those denoted by reference numerals 21 and 23 in the<br>
figures cannot been seen behind the non-elastic yarn)<br>
in front and back two ground knitted fabrics is<br>
preferably not less than 2% and not more than 60%, more<br>
preferably not less than 4% and not more than 20%,<br>
based on the non-elastic yarn in the same knitted<br>
fabric. As the content of polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers decreases, a stretch performance of the entire<br>
knitted fabric is reduced. If the content of elastic<br>
yarn is less than 2%, the amount of elastic yarn is so<br>
small that the stretch performance of the entire<br>
knitted fabric may be reduced. Therefore, sufficient<br>
stretchability is hard to be added to the entire<br>
knitted fabric, and if the content is greater than 60%,<br><br>
becomes closer to 90°, thus making it possible to<br>
improve the compression resilience and recovery rate of<br>
the elastic knitted fabric having a three-dimension<br>
structure.<br>
By using a bare string of polyurethane<br>
elastic yarn as a binding yarn, the fiber pack density<br>
of a binding site located in the middle of the three-<br>
dimensional structure drops so that a space expands.<br>
That is, the bare string(s) of polyurethane elastic<br>
yarn is formed into a monofilament in such a manner<br>
that several single strings are fusion-bound, and<br>
therefore a space in the air gap of the binding site is<br>
large. On the other hand, in the case of a composite<br>
elastic yarn using the polyurethane elastic yarn as a<br>
core, covered with mono or multi-non-elastic fibers,<br>
the composite elastic yarn itself thickens, or covering<br>
fibers expands in. a connecting site with<br>
expansion/contraction of the polyurethane elastic yarn<br>
and as a result, a space in the air gap is lessened.<br>
By using a bare string of polyurethane elastic yarn as<br>
a binding yarn, the air permeability of the entire<br>
knitted fabric is considerably improved, and weight<br>
saving can be achieved. Further, by using a bare<br>
string of polyurethane elastic yarn as a connecting<br>
yarn, the contact area of connecting yarns decreases in<br>
the connecting site, and thus the heat conductivity<br>
drops, and a large amount of air layer is contained,<br>
resulting in an improvement in heat retaining property<br><br>
the density of the knitted fabric becomes so high that<br>
the mass per unit area may excessively increase to<br>
compromise the air permeability. If the content of<br>
elastic yarn is not less than 4% and not more than 20%,<br>
an optimum knitted fabric having stretchability, being<br>
soft and having an appropriate tension and drape<br>
property can be obtained.<br>
If formation of stitches with the bare string<br>
of polyurethane based elastic fibers in the ground<br>
knitted fabric is continuous, plain-knitted weaves are<br>
formed with the bare string but in this case, bare<br>
strings contact each other at a contact point of<br>
stitches in a loop-nodal manner, and the ground knitted<br>
fabric is heat-sealed in set processing during refine<br>
dye-finishing and dyeing, and thus the so-called run<br>
such that stitches are deknitted from the end of the<br>
substrate never occurs even if the ground knitted<br>
fabric is knitted by plain knitting or chain knitting.<br>
Further, the binding yarn contacts the bare string of<br>
polyurethane; based elastic fibers at a nodal site of<br>
the binding yarn and the ground knitted fabric, and if<br>
refine dye-finishing is similarly performed in this<br>
state, the above described contact site is heat-sealed<br>
in dry heat setting and wet heat processing during<br>
dyeing. In this case, the knitted fabric is free from<br>
a weave shift and stable even if the entire knitted<br>
fabric is distorted and stressed. In the case of the<br>
elastic circular knitted fabric having a three-<br><br>
dimensional structure, a resilient force of<br>
polyurethane is transmitted quickly throughout the<br>
knitted fabric to improve the instant resilience of the<br>
knitted fabric. In the case of the elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric having a three-dimensional structure,<br>
the resilience from compression along the thickness of<br>
the three-dimensional structure is improved, and<br>
deformation can be endured to recover the original<br>
shape even under a shearing force because the ground<br>
knitted fabric and the polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers of the binding yarn are fusion-bound together in<br>
front and back ground knitted fabrics. Further, when a<br>
knitted fabric is formed into a cloth, it has been<br>
conventionally required that the ends of the knitted<br>
fabric are sewn together by a sewing machine or the<br>
like. However, the knitted fabric of the present<br>
invention can be used for a cloth in a cut state<br>
because the polyurethane fibers of the ground knitted<br>
fabric and the binding yarn are fusion-bound together.<br>
In this case, the bare string of polyurethane elastic<br>
yarn should be knitted into both front and back ground<br>
knitted fabrics. Further, for the problem such that<br>
the binding yarn easily falls out from the stitch due<br>
to expansion/contraction at the time of wearing the<br>
knitted fabric, the bare string of polyurethane elastic<br>
yarn is preferably knitted into the ground knitted<br>
fabric, and further preferably into both the ground<br>
knitted fabrics. In this way, the bare string of<br><br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers is knitted into the<br>
front and back two ground knitted fabrics, resulting in<br>
many advantages given to the elastic circular knitted<br>
fabric having a three-layer structure and the elastic<br>
circular knitted fabric having a three-dimensional<br>
structure. Here, if a non-elastic heat seal yarn and<br>
thermoplastic synthetic fibers such as polyester are<br>
heat-sealed in the three-dimensional structure, the<br>
entire knitted fabric is hardened, and bending rigidity<br>
increases, so that the knitted fabric can hardly be<br>
worn by a person or used at a location close to the<br>
skin, as described previously. However, if<br>
polyurethane elastic fibers are fusion-bound together,<br>
a binding point is fixed, but the yarn itself expands<br>
and contracts, and therefore the knitted fabric as a<br>
whole has stretchability, is soft and has an<br>
appropriate tension and drape.<br>
The case will now be described where only one<br>
of front and back ground knitted fabrics has<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers as a bare string and<br>
a non-elastic yarn arranged to form stitches, and both<br>
the ground knitted fabrics are bound together with the<br>
bare string(s) of polyurethane based elastic fibers.<br>
In this case, since the front and back knitted fabrics<br>
have different expansion/contraction powers, and the<br>
expansion/contraction power of the ground knitted<br>
fabric containing polyurethane based elastic fibers is<br>
greater than that of the other ground knitted fabric, a<br><br>
problem arises such that curling of the substrate<br>
occurs with the ground knitted fabric of greater<br>
expansion/contraction power being inside, thus making<br>
it impossible to obtain a practical elastic knitted<br>
fabric. Particularly, this disadvantage occurs in the<br>
three-dimensional structure elastic circular knitted<br>
fabric, but is especially significant in the three-<br>
layer elastic circular knitted fabric. Thus, when the<br>
bare string of polyurethane based elastic fibers in one<br>
ground knitted fabric is knitted, the size of the<br>
binding yarn should be greater than the size of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers of the ground knitted<br>
fabric for alleviating the unbalance of knitted fabric<br>
expansion/contraction powers. The present inventors<br>
have conducted vigorous studies on this problem, and<br>
found that if the ratio (D-c/D-g) of the size (D-c) of<br>
binding polyurethane based elastic fibers to the size<br>
(D-g) of polyurethane based elastic fibers in the<br>
ground knitted fabric is 2 or greater, curling of the<br>
substrate is alleviated, and the ratio of 3 or greater<br>
is further preferable, thus making it possible to<br>
provide a three-layer structure elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric capable of being practically used.<br>
The compression performance and the<br>
compression recoverability of the elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric and the elastic warp knitted fabric<br>
having a three-dimensional structure, of the present<br>
invention, vary depending on the thickness of the<br><br>
elastic knitted fabric and the size of the elastic yarn<br>
used for the binding yarn 3. That is, as the size of<br>
the elastic yarn used for the binding yarn 3 increases,<br>
the compression performance and the compression<br>
recoverability are improved, while as the thickness of<br>
the elastic knitted fabric increases, the compression<br>
performance and the compression recoverability are<br>
reduced.<br>
In the present invention, a ratio between the<br>
gross size (D) (decitex) of the binding yarn 3 bound in<br>
any area of 1 cm2 in the ground knitted fabric and the<br>
thickness (T) (mm) of the knitted fabric of the area<br>
preferably meets the requirement of 5 x 103 
105. If 5 x 103 &gt; D/T holds, it may be impossible to<br>
achieve a sufficient improvement in compression<br>
performance and compression recoverability, while if<br>
D/T &gt; 5 x 105 holds, the compression resistance and the<br>
bending rigidity of the entire knitted fabric tend to<br>
increase, so that generally, use by a person around his<br>
or her body may involve some difficulty.<br>
In the case of the elastic circular knitted<br>
fabric having a three-dimensional structure, the<br>
binding yarn is bound to the stitch of the ground<br>
knitted fabric by tuck knitting. In the case of the<br>
elastic warp knitted fabric having a three-dimensional<br>
structure, the binding yarn is bound to the stitch of<br>
the ground knitted fabric by knit sewing and/or tuck<br>
knitting. The rate (R) of stitches bound to the<br><br>
connecting yarn, of stitches in an area of 1 cm2 at any<br>
site of front and back two ground knitted fabrics, is<br>
preferably 25% or greater. If the rate (R) of the<br>
stitches is less than 25%, the number of strings of<br>
connecting yarn decreases, so that it may be impossible<br>
to obtain a sufficient resilience and recovery rate.<br>
By increasing the size of the connecting yarn to be<br>
used, the compression resilience and recoverability are<br>
improved, but irregularities may occur on the surface<br>
of the ground knitted fabric due to the connection to<br>
compromise the flatness of the surface of the<br>
substrate.<br>
Except for the case where the connecting yarn<br>
and the ground knitted fabric are bound at all<br>
stitches, the pattern in which the connecting yarn is<br>
connected to the stitch of the ground knitted fabric is<br>
different for each of any courses. However, for<br>
example, if the ground knitted fabric is connected to<br>
the connecting yarn at odd-number stitches in an<br>
alternate manner in any course, and the ground knitted<br>
fabric is connected to the connecting yarn at even-<br>
number stitches in an alternate manner in the next<br>
course, the surface of the ground knitted fabric<br>
becomes uniform, and the compression resilience and<br>
recovery rate become uniform for each knitted fabric<br>
site, which is preferable. The phase of the connecting<br>
site is shifted for each knitting course, and this is<br>
repeated to obtain a satisfactory knitted fabric.<br><br>
Then, as a result of conducting vigorous<br>
studies on elongation characteristics of the substrate<br>
following the elongation of the skin associated with a<br>
motion of a person, the present inventors have found<br>
the elastic knitted fabric having a multilayer<br>
structure according to any one of claims 5, 6 and 7,<br>
characterized in that the elongation in each of warp<br>
and weft directions is 80 to 150% under a load of 3.5<br>
N/cm, and 100 to 200% under a load of 9.8 N/cm, an<br>
elongation ratio (A) and an elongation ratio (B) in<br>
warp and weft directions, expressed by the following<br>
equations (1) and (2), are both in a range of 0.8 to<br>
1.2.<br>
Elongation ratio (A) = elongation (%) in warp<br>
direction under load of 3.5 N/cm -i- elongation in weft<br>
direction (%)	(1)<br>
Elongation ratio (B) = elongation (%) in warp<br>
direction under load of 9.8 N/cm H- elongation in weft<br>
direction (%)	(2)<br>
That is, the present inventors have found<br>
that a stress in the elongation direction when the<br>
motion of the person along the body height is followed<br>
to elongate the substrate and a stress of the substrate<br>
in the circumference direction of the human body<br>
significantly affect the wear feeling; and if a<br>
predetermined elongation is provided in both warp and<br>
weft directions of the knitted fabric, an elastic<br>
knitted fabric excellent in motion following<br><br>
characteristics and detachability and comfortable for<br>
wearing can be obtained; and by inhibiting an<br>
unnecessary elongation of the substrate, durability of<br>
the substrate can be improved. Thus, the present<br>
inventors achieved the present invention.<br>
The elongation described above refers to a<br>
value measured with a monoaxially fixed biaxial tensile<br>
tester (STRIP BIAIAL TENSILTESTER KES-G2-SB1<br>
manufactured by Kato Tech Co., Ltd.). The substrate is<br>
restrained in one direction and the substrate<br>
elongation in the other direction is measured, thus<br>
making it possible to measure the elongation for<br>
practical use. Incidentally, since the conventional<br>
elongation measurement method is such that a<br>
measurement is made with only the elongation direction<br>
fixed and other directions not restrained, it has a<br>
disadvantage that the substrate width changes at the<br>
middle of the grip, thus making it impossible to<br>
measure a change in stress in two directions covering<br>
the cloth width at the time of wearing.<br>
The load of 3.5 N/cm according to the present<br>
invention corresponds to the power with which a person<br>
of average power may pull the fabric when he or she<br>
wears it. The feeling of the soft power or hard power<br>
in the circumference direction of the person varies<br>
depending on product concepts and personal preferences,<br>
but if the elongation in the warp direction of the<br>
elastic knitted fabric under the load of 3.5 N/cm is<br><br>
less than 80%, elongation of the substrate is generally<br>
insufficient, thus requiring an excessive force for<br>
wearing and taking off the fabric. On the other hand,<br>
if the elongation in the weft direction is less than<br>
80%, one feels strained because the skin elongation in<br>
the elongation direction in a lie motion is maximum<br>
50%, and if the fabric is worn as a girdle,<br>
unpleasantness is brought about such that a waist line<br>
or the lower end of the femor is shifted. Furthermore,<br>
if the elongation in each of warp and weft directions<br>
of the elastic knitted fabric is greater than 200%<br>
under the load of 3.5 N/cm, expansion/contraction<br>
fatigues of the elastic yarn become so significant that<br>
durability is compromised and the strength of the<br>
substrate is reduced.<br>
The load of 9.8 N/cm corresponds to the<br>
utmost extended elongation of the substrate and to the<br>
power causing an accident of breaking through the<br>
substrate by a consumer. For preventing such an<br>
accident, the utmost extended elongation should be<br>
reduced to 200% or smaller to prevent the substrate<br>
from being roughened. From this point of view, the<br>
smaller the elongation under the load of 9.8 N/cm, the<br>
better, but an elongation of 100% or greater under the<br>
load of 9.8 N/cm is required for ensuring comfort at<br>
the time when wearing and taking off the fabric. It<br>
has been found that if the ratio of the elongation is<br>
0.80 or less, elongation in the weft direction is<br><br>
greater than elongation in the warp direction, and if<br>
the balance of the elongation is 1.200 or greater,<br>
elongation in the warp direction is greater than<br>
elongation in the weft direction, thus making it<br>
difficult to obtain a comfort wearing feeling.<br>
Preferably, the knitted fabric in which the<br>
binding yarn 6 is bound to both ground knitted fabrics<br>
at tuck weaves is excellent in stability, which is free<br>
from a curling phenomenon such that the ear part is<br>
curled up when being cut. Further, in the conventional<br>
knitted fabric, the power can be different only for<br>
warp and weft directions, but by knitting a fabric with<br>
the tuck weave of the present invention, power-up in<br>
the course direction alone is made possible, and the<br>
warp/weft ratio of the elongation and power can be in a<br>
range of 0.8 to 1.2.<br>
The polyurethane based elastic fibers for use<br>
in the present invention include not only polyurethane<br>
elastic fibers but also polyether ester based elastic<br>
fibers. For the polyurethane elastic fibers, for<br>
example, dry-spun fibers or melt-spun fibers can be<br>
used, and polymers and spinning processes are not<br>
specifically limited. The size of fibers is usually 17<br>
to 3000 decitexes, preferably 22 to 620 decitexes. The<br>
break elongation is preferably 400% to 1200% for<br>
obtaining fibers excellent in stretchability. Further,<br>
it is preferable that stretchability is not compromised<br>
at around 180°C which is a normal processing temperature<br><br>
in a preset step during dyeing.<br>
The polyurethane elastic fibers include, for<br>
example, but not limited to, polyurethane elastic<br>
fibers comprised of a copolymerized polyalkylene ether<br>
diol, an aromatic diisocyanate mainly composed of 4,4-<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and a polyurethane<br>
obtained from bifunctional diamine, in which the number<br>
average molecular weight of the urethane part of the<br>
polyurethane is 6000 to 9500, the number average<br>
molecular weight of the urea part is 650 to 950, the<br>
300% modulus is 0.20 g/decitexes or less.<br>
The non-elastic yarn constituting the front<br>
and back ground knitted fabrics of the three-<br>
dimensional knitted fabric of the present invention may<br>
be any of a filament yarn and a spun yarn.<br>
Specifically, filament yarns include preferably yarns<br>
composed of synthetic fibers such as viscose rayon,<br>
cupra rayon, acetate fibers, polyamide fibers,<br>
polyester fibers, polytrimethylene terephthalate<br>
fibers, acryl fibers, polypropylene fibers and vinyl<br>
chloride fibers. The form of these fibers may be any<br>
of a unprocessed gray yarn, a false twist finished<br>
yarn, a colored yarn and the like, or may be a<br>
composite yarn thereof. Spun yarns include preferably<br>
yarns using short fibers composed of natural fibers<br>
such as cotton, wool and hemp, and synthetic fibers<br>
such as viscose rayon, cupra rayon, acetate fibers,<br>
polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, acryl fibers,<br><br>
polypropylene fibers and vinyl chloride fibers, and may<br>
be single yarn or mixed yarn.<br>
The gross size of a yarn that is used for<br>
forming front and back ground knitted fabrics is<br>
preferably in a range of 22 to 1220 decitexes, more<br>
preferably 33 to 310 decitexes. The size of a single<br>
yarn is preferably in a range of 0.1 to 310 decitexes,<br>
more preferably 0.2 to 20 decitexes.<br>
The elastic knitted fabric having a<br>
multilayer structure, of the present invention, is<br>
characterized in that the elastic knitted fabric is<br>
easily subjected to heat molding. The multilayer<br>
structure elastic knitted fabric of the present<br>
invention having recessed portions and/or raised<br>
portions formed and fixed by heat molding preferably<br>
contains elastic fibers in the front or back ground<br>
knitted fabric, more preferably in both the front and<br>
back ground knitted fabrics. The mixing ratio of<br>
polyurethane elastic fibers in the knitted fabric is<br>
not limited, but is preferably 5 to 60% by mass. The<br>
knitted fabric containing elastic fibers on the front<br>
or back face is characterized in that mold<br>
processability is improved, stretchability can be added<br>
after molding, and the original shape is easily<br>
recovered even if the knitted fabric is deformed under<br>
an external pressure. The elastic fibers are<br>
preferably polyurethane elastic fibers, and may be<br>
identical to or different from polyurethane elastic<br><br>
fibers used for the binding yarn. In this way, the<br>
elastic knitted fabric having a multilayer structure,<br>
of the present invention, has the skeletal structure of<br>
the elastic knitted fabric formed by polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers, and is therefore easily subjected to<br>
irregularity imposition processing due to the heat<br>
fixation performance of polyurethane based elastic<br>
fibers, and an irregular form after imposition<br>
processing persists. This characteristic is<br>
particularly remarkable in the elastic knitted fabric<br>
with a three-dimensional structure having an air gap<br>
between front and back two ground knitted fabrics, and<br>
the elastic knitted fabric with a three-dimensional<br>
structure is excellent in irregularity-retaining<br>
properties owing to its rigidity. Of course, the non-<br>
elastic yarn constituting the ground knitted fabric is<br>
preferably composed of polyester fibers excellent in<br>
thermoplasticity, polypropylene fibers having a<br>
relative low melting point, or the like. The front and<br>
back knitted fabrics may be separately formed with<br>
these elastic yarns having different thermal<br>
characteristics. For example, a knitted fabric with<br>
the back face cured like a resin and the front face<br>
having a soft feel giving comfort to the human skin is<br>
obtained depending on the temperature and time during<br>
imposition-type processing.<br>
The gray fabric of the multilayer structure<br>
elastic knitted fabric is capable of being opened,<br><br>
subjected to preprocessing, then undergoing a dyeing<br>
step and undergoing a finish set including resin<br>
processing.<br>
The multilayer structure elastic knitted<br>
fabric of the present invention is characterized in<br>
that a recessed portion or raised portion is formed and<br>
fixed by heat molding. The method for carrying out<br>
heat molding is not limited. If an overheating plate<br>
is used, an elastic knitted fabric excellent in form<br>
fixation characteristics and excellent in<br>
recoverability for recovering the original shape even<br>
if the knitted fabric is recessed under an external<br>
force can be obtained.<br>
As heat molding using an overheating plate,<br>
for example, the front face is placed on a desired<br>
concave female mold, and then pressed with a convex<br>
male mold from the back face, and both layer parts are<br>
heat-molded with the female mold previously heated to a<br>
high temperature and the male mold previously heated to<br>
a lower temperature than the female mold. It is<br>
preferable that the space between the female mold and<br>
the male mold is separated into required form-fixed<br>
thicknesses, and heat press molding is carried out.<br>
The heat molding temperature, the heat molding time,<br>
the heat molding interval and the like may be selected<br>
as appropriate according to a desired form.<br>
The three-dimensional structure fabric of the<br>
present invention has a volume retaining factor of<br><br>
preferably 0.5 or greater, more preferably 0.6 or<br>
greater. Where the mold volume of a mold for heat<br>
molding is A, and the mold volume of a heat-molded<br>
three-dimensional structure knitted fabric is B, the<br>
volume retaining factor is calculated as B/A. If the<br>
volume retaining factor of the heat mold form is less<br>
than 0.5, the form of the knitted fabric is not<br>
sufficiently retained after molding. For obtaining a<br>
mold product using such a three-dimensional knitted<br>
fabric, the elongation of the knitted fabric during<br>
heat molding should be increased, and therefore the<br>
step performance tends to be compromised such that yarn<br>
breaking easily occurs.<br>
For example, a specimen of 30 cm (warp) x 30<br>
cm (weft) of the three-dimensional structure knitted<br>
fabric is taken and subjected to helmet-shaped<br>
male/female molding toward the center, whereby a helmet<br>
cushion material capable of being used as a core<br>
material of the helmet in a molded state and having a<br>
three-dimensional structure is obtained. Furthermore,<br>
a specimen of 20 cm (warp) x 45 cm (weft) is taken and<br>
subjected to brassiere cup molding, and periphery is<br>
sewn by an over lock sewing machine leaving only a<br>
required part, whereby a sport brassiere can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The three-dimensional structure knitted<br>
fabric of the present invention has independent front<br>
and back knitted fabrics, and therefore a desired<br><br>
knitted fabric can be obtained by changing a<br>
combination of materials used for the front and back<br>
knitted fabrics. If the front and back knitted fabrics<br>
are tuck-knitted using a connecting yarn composed of<br>
polyurethane elastic fibers, the knitted fabric, when<br>
used for a supporter, etc., may preferably alleviate<br>
the impact of an external force applied. The<br>
multilayer structure elastic knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention can be heat-molded into one part of a<br>
desired three-dimensional structure, and then bound to<br>
a different material (e.g. weave, knitted fabric,<br>
leather, vinyl chloride sheet, etc.) by sewing to be<br>
formed into a desired shape for use. Furthermore, it<br>
can be subjected to flocky processing to raise one or<br>
both faces for use.<br>
In the elastic knitted fabric having a<br>
multilayer structure, of the present invention, a<br>
textile design can be given to the ground knitted<br>
fabric by jacquard knitting using a plurality of non-<br>
elastic yarns for the ground knitted fabric. Further,<br>
in the elastic circular knitted fabric and the elastic<br>
warp knitted fabric having a three-dimensional<br>
structure, of the present invention, front and back two<br>
ground knitted fabrics are partly bound in a contact<br>
state, whereby a three-dimensional site and a linear or<br>
planar three-layer structure site are formed and as a<br>
result, a three-dimensional design having<br>
irregularities can be given to the entire knitted<br><br>
fabric.<br>
For giving a three-dimensional design to the<br>
surface of the ground knitted fabric, the feed amount<br>
of connecting yarn may be reduced at any site to<br>
substantially contact-bind front and back two ground<br>
knitted fabrics, or change the distance between the two<br>
ground knitted fabrics (thickness). Further, the non-<br>
elastic yarn for forming one ground knitted fabric may<br>
be used to form the other knitted fabric.<br>
Further, the elastic knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention is such that the elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric having a three-dimensional structure,<br>
the elastic circular knitted fabric having a three-<br>
layer structure, and the three-dimensional site and the<br>
linear or planar three-layer structure site with the<br>
above elastic circular knitted fabrics combined are<br>
formed. As a result, a three-dimensional design having<br>
irregularities is given to the entire elastic knitted<br>
fabric of the present invention, which may be applied<br>
to a seamless formed cloth partly unopened and partly<br>
sewn in a cylindrical form. The present invention can<br>
implement a function required for each site of a cloth.<br>
That is, taking shorts for cycling as an example, a<br>
site corresponding to the saddle is three-dimensionally<br>
knitted, and a three-layer structure elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric of relatively high power is formed for a<br>
site around the waist.<br>
The present invention also relates to a<br><br>
process for knitting a knitted fabric containing an<br>
elastic yarn, and particularly to a process for<br>
knitting an elastic circular knitted fabric<br>
characterized in that when at least two elastic yarn<br>
packages are fed from one yarn feeder in a circular<br>
knitting machine, bare strings of elastic yarn are fed<br>
at two or more different feed speeds.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have found<br>
a process for manufacturing an elastic knitted fabric<br>
having a multilayer structure, characterized in that a<br>
feed speed (V-g) of a bare string of polyurethane based<br>
fibers knitting a ground knitted fabric is unequal to a<br>
feed speed (V-c) of a bare string of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers binding front and back knitted fabrics,<br>
and made an apparatus for implementing the process. In<br>
the active delivery process of delivering polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers to knitting needles from a spool<br>
for bare strings of polyurethane based elastic fibers,<br>
mounted on one circular knitting machine, the strings<br>
are delivered at two or more different feed speeds,<br>
whereby a various knitted fabrics , especially elastic<br>
circular knitted fabrics having multilayer structures,<br>
which have not been achievable, can be obtained.<br>
Further, the present inventors have found<br>
that by feeding the bare string of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers binding front and back ground knitted<br>
fabrics at a controlled draw ratio of 2 or less, a<br>
three-layer structure knitted fabric with front and<br><br>
back two ground knitted fabrics bound together as well<br>
as a three-dimensional structure elastic circular<br>
knitted fabric having an air gap between both the<br>
ground knitted fabrics can be manufactured.<br>
The present inventors devised an apparatus<br>
for delivering a bare string of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers required for manufacturing the<br>
multilayer elastic circular knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention. Traditionally, the feeder proposed<br>
in JP-B-4-9222 has a pair of support rolls extending to<br>
the left and right of the main body (holder), is driven<br>
by a toothed tape associated with a knitting machine,<br>
and can freely rotate a plurality of elastic yarn<br>
packages on a pair of support-drive rolls attached to<br>
the holder.<br>
In the apparatus, however, if there is only<br>
one toothed tape associated with the knitting machine,<br>
the feed amount of polyurethane based elastic fibers is<br>
all fixed. Thus, the present inventors devised a<br>
method for changing the feed amount of polyurethane<br>
based elastic fibers by increasing the number of<br>
toothed tapes. In this case, however, four packages of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers are placed in one<br>
feeder, thus raising a problem such that the feed<br>
amount is changed on a unit of four packages and thus<br>
the degree of freedom is limited. Thus, the inventors<br>
devised an apparatus capable of stably feeding strings<br>
at different rates from elastic fiber packages with one<br><br>
yarn feeder even if driven by one toothed tape.<br>
Specifically, it is a yarn feeder characterized in that<br>
a pair of cheese support-drive rollers extending in<br>
parallel to each other, rotatably supported on a<br>
holder, is so situated as to protrude in opposite<br>
directions from the holder, driving means for rotating<br>
the cheese support-drive roller is installed, and a<br>
pair of cheese support-drive rollers having different<br>
outer diameters is installed, and/or means for driving<br>
in variable speed a pair of cheese support-drive<br>
rollers in opposite directions is installed, so that<br>
the surface speeds of the cheese support-drive rollers<br>
are different for the opposite directions of the<br>
holder. The pair of cheese support-drive rollers has a<br>
through-hole in a cylinder core and has a part for<br>
fixation so that it is detachably fixed to a drive<br>
shaft. The yarn feeder is characterized by further<br>
comprising another pre-drawing roller rotating at a<br>
surface speed greater than that of the pair of cheese<br>
support-drive rollers rotating at the same surface<br>
speed.<br>
The present invention proposes a method and<br>
an apparatus for feeding an elastic yarn for knitting<br>
an elastic knitted fabric in which two types should be<br>
fed at different speeds. Typical examples of<br>
conventional knitted fabrics made by cross-knitting<br>
elastic bare strings include plain-knitted fabric, but<br>
the knitted fabric is made by plain knitting the<br><br>
elastic yarn arranged with the non-elastic yarn.<br>
Furthermore, another example is a rib-knitted fabric<br>
but in this case, the elastic yarn forms a plain-<br>
knitted fabric with a dial needle. They each have one<br>
type of elastic yarn weave, and can be treated by a<br>
normal knitting machine with a single elastic yarn<br>
feeder without any problems. The present inventors<br>
invented an apparatus and method capable of feeding at<br>
different speeds along with the invention of a new<br>
weave requiring yarn feeding at different speeds.<br>
That is, the elastic yarn feeder of the<br>
present invention is mainly mounted concentrically<br>
around a circular knitting machine, and can feed a bare<br>
string of elastic fibers wound in a cheese form to the<br>
knitting machine at a fixed speed while releasing and<br>
draw-controlling the string.<br>
The outline of the apparatus will be<br>
described specifically below with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
Furthermore, FIG. 5 is a sectional view of<br>
the interior of a holder 15 of a yarn feeder of the<br>
present invention seen from the side, and FIG. 6 is a<br>
front view of the yarn feeder of the present invention.<br>
In the yarn feeder, a pair of package<br>
support-drive rollers (11-a and 11-b) extending in<br>
parallel to each other, rotatably supported on the<br>
holder (15) is so situated as to protrude in opposite<br>
directions from the holder (15), and a toothed belt<br>
(13) and a drive transmitting apparatus are installed<br><br>
as driving means for rotating the package support-drive<br>
roller. A pair of package support-drive rollers (11-a)<br>
and (11-b) have different outer diameters so that the<br>
surface speeds of the cheese support-drive rollers are<br>
different for the opposite directions of the holder.<br>
The pair of support-drive rollers has a structure such<br>
that a through-hole is provided in a cylinder core, so<br>
that the support roller can be fixed to a drive shaft,<br>
and a change can be made as appropriate for a different<br>
yarn speed ratio. Further, pre-draw rollers (12-a) and<br>
(12-b) rotating at a surface speed greater than that of<br>
the pair of package support-drive roller (11-a) or (11-<br>
b) are provided, and a yarn breakage sensor (14) is<br>
provided at a position between the package support-<br>
drive roller (11-a) and the pre-draw roller (12-a) at<br>
which the elastic yarn is draw-controlled after being<br>
released. The diameter of the package support-drive<br>
roller is 1 to 10 cm, and the ratio of the rotation<br>
speed of a high yarn speed roller to the rotation speed<br>
of a low yarn speed roller can be 10. Furthermore, the<br>
pre-draw roller (12-a) or (12-b) rotates at a surface<br>
speed greater by a factor of 1.2 to 2.0 than at least<br>
the corresponding cheese support-drive roller (11-a) or<br>
(11-b). Furthermore, reference symbols 10-a and 10-b<br>
each denote a package with a bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic yarn wound around a paper<br>
tube.<br>
An effect of the present invention is<br><br>
described below: If an elastic feeder that has been<br>
generally used as shown in JP-B-4-9222 is used, a cost<br>
for additionally introducing a drive system and an<br>
apparatus installation space are required for feeding<br>
elastic yarns at different speeds as in conditions for<br>
knitting the multilayer structure knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention because the yarn speed is fixed.<br>
Furthermore, the elastic yarn is slightly adhesive, and<br>
thus often causes problems of release failure for high-<br>
speed releasing and low draft releasing. The present<br>
apparatus can solve the former problem at a low cost,<br>
and can solve the latter problem by installing a pre-<br>
draw roller.<br>
The present invention will be specifically<br>
described below with Examples.<br>
Physical properties for use in the present<br>
invention are measured as follows.<br>
(1)	Mass per unit area<br>
Measurements are made according to the test<br>
method of mass per square meter in JIS-L-1018.<br>
(2)	Thickness<br>
KES-EB3 Compression Tester manufactured by<br>
Kato Tech Co., Ltd. is used. A sample is held between<br>
cupper plates each having a circular surface having an<br>
area of 2 cm2 (compression speed 0.02 mm/sec), the<br>
thickness of the sample is measured at five points<br>
under a compressive pressure Pm of 0.5 g/cm2, and the<br>
average of the measured values is calculated.<br><br>
(3)	Compressibility and Recovery rate<br>
Measurements are made according to JIS-L-<br>
1018. A three-dimensional knitted fabric is slit into<br>
a size of 2 cm x 2 cm, one piece of slit fabric is<br>
'placed on a measurement table, and a thickness A is<br>
measured when an initial load of 20 cN is applied to an<br>
area of 4 cm2 along the thickness from above. Then, a<br>
load of 300 cN is applied to the area of 4 cm2, a<br>
thickness B is measured after one minute, then the load<br>
is removed and the sample is left standing for one<br>
minute, and a thickness C is measured when the initial<br>
load is applied again. The measurement is repeated<br>
three times, a compressibility and a recovery rate are<br>
calculated according to the following equations, and<br>
the averages of the calculated values are determined.<br>
Compressibility (%) = {(A-B)/A} x 100<br>
Recovery rate (%) = {(C-B)/(A-B)} x 100<br>
(4)	Air permeability<br>
KES-F8-AP1 Air Permeability Tester<br>
manufactured by Kato Tech Co., Ltd. is used to measure<br>
an air flow resistance five times, and the average of<br>
the measured values is calculated.<br>
(5)	Feel of substrate<br>
A determination is made based on the results<br>
of sensory test by five monitors.<br>
(6)	Elongation and Elongation recovery rate<br>
A knitted fabric is slit into a size of 2.5<br>
cm x 15 cm. An elongation recovery curve of elongation<br><br><br>
and recovery of the fabric is made under up to a<br>
maximum load of 9.8 N/cm with a holding length of 10 cm<br>
and at an elongation speed of 100 %/minute using a<br>
constant speed elongation tester (Tensilon manufactured<br>
by Toyo Baldwin Co, Ltd.). An elongation under the<br>
load of 9.8 N/cm is read from this curve. Furthermore,<br>
elongation ratios are determined from the following<br>
equations.<br>
Elongation ratio (A) = elongation (%) in warp<br>
direction under load of 3.5 N/cm -s- elongation (%) in<br>
weft direction<br>
Elongation ratio (B) = elongation (%) in warp<br>
direction under load of 9.8 N/cm + elongation (%) in<br>
weft direction<br>
The elongation recovery rate is determined,<br>
according to the following equation, from an elongation<br>
amount (c) under the load of 9.8 N/cm and an elongation<br>
amount (d) when the load under recovery equals 0.<br>
Elongation recovery rate (%) = (c-d) x 100/c<br>
(7) Elastic fiber draw resistance<br>
A knitted fabric is cut into a size having a<br>
length of 7.5 cm and a width of 2.5 cm with the warp<br>
direction as the direction of elastic fibers. Then,<br>
both sides of one elastic fiber at the center in the<br>
width direction is cut up to 1/3 in the warp direction,<br>
and the elastic fiber is taken out from the knitted<br>
fabric. Then, the elastic fiber is cut with scissors<br>
at a position of 2.5 cm in the substrate of the elastic<br><br>
fiber to fabricate a measurement specimen, and<br>
measurements are made under the following measurement<br>
conditions.<br>
(Measurement conditions) The knitted fabric<br>
portion and the elastic fiber are each held by the<br>
constant speed elongation tester (Tensilon manufactured<br>
by Toyo Baldwin Co., Ltd.), and the elastic fiber is<br>
drawn at an elongation speed of 30 cm/minute. The<br>
resistance at this time is recorded, and the average of<br>
draw stress peaks is determined.<br>
(8) Volume retaining factor<br>
For the molding volume of a knitted fabric, a<br>
thermoplastic film (synthetic resin film softened with<br>
dry heat of 80 to 100°C) is placed on the surface of a<br>
molded knitted fabric, the same mold shape is retained<br>
along a recessed or raised portion of the knitted<br>
fabric with dry heat air (a dryer set at a softening<br>
temperature), and then the thermoplastic film is fixed<br>
with cool air. Water is made to flow over the<br>
thermoplastic film retaining the shape of the recessed<br>
and raised portions of the knitted fabric to measure<br>
the volume.<br>
The volume of a mold used for molding is a<br>
heat molding volume. The volume of the molded knitted<br>
fabric is measured, and the volume retaining factor is<br>
calculated according to the following equations.<br>
Volume retaining factor = (molding volume<br>
retained by molded knitted fabric)/ (heat molding<br><br>
volume)<br>
Example 1<br>
A polyester false twist finished yarn of 84<br>
decitexes and 30 filaments (Technofine® manufactured by<br>
Asahi Kasei Corporation) was used as a yarn for use in<br>
a front knitted fabric and a back knitted fabric of a<br>
three-dimensional knitted fabric to form a knitted<br>
fabric into plain stitch. A bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers of 155 decitexes<br>
(Roica® manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) was<br>
used as a yarn for binding the front and back knitted<br>
fabrics together.<br>
Bind-knitting was performed with all the<br>
needles of an interlock double circular knitting<br>
machine of 28 gage, 30 inch diameter and 60 aperture<br>
(Model Type V-LEC6 manufactured by Fukuhara Works,<br>
Ltd.) to obtain a circular knitted fabric with the<br>
distance between unit patterns set to 4 mm. At this<br>
time, the loop length of the bare string of<br>
polyurethane based elastic fibers was 800 cm, and the<br>
loop length of the knitted fabric constituting the<br>
front face and the back face was 827 cm, resulting in<br>
the loop length ratio (T) of 1.0.<br>
The obtained circular knitted grey fabric was<br>
opened, refined by a jet dyeing machine at 80°C for 30<br>
minutes, and heat-treated at 190°C for 60 seconds while<br>
tentering by 5% in the width direction by a tenter<br>
finisher as a preset. Then, the fabric was dyed at<br><br>
130°C for 60 minutes using a high pressure jet dyeing<br>
machine. The fabric was heat-treated at 170°C for 45<br>
seconds while tentering by 3% in the width direction<br>
using a tenter finisher as a finishing set to obtain a<br>
dyed fabric. Knitting specifications and knitting<br>
characteristics in this case are shown in Tables 1 and<br>
2.<br>
The obtained three-dimensional knitted fabric<br>
had a thickness of 2.65 mm, a compressibility of 60%, a<br>
recovery ratio of 92.0% and an air permeability of<br>
0.45, and had a good feel. This three-dimensional<br>
knitted fabric was very suitable for inner sole<br>
materials of shoes and the like, bed pats of life<br>
materials and the like.<br>
Example 2<br>
A front knitted fabric and a back knitted<br>
fabric of a three-dimensional knitted fabric were<br>
knitted in the same manner as in Example 1. A bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers of 310<br>
decitexes (Roica® manufactured by Asahi Kasei<br>
Corporation) was used as a yarn for binding the front<br>
and back knitted fabrics together. At this time, bind-<br>
knitting was performed with all needles. The obtained<br>
knitted fabric was subjected to processing same as that<br>
of Example 1. Knitting specifications and knitting<br>
characteristics in this case are shown in Tables 1 and<br>
2.<br>
The obtained three-dimensional knitted fabric<br><br>
had a thickness of 3.12 mm, a compressibility of 55%, a<br>
recovery ratio of 99.4% and an air permeability of<br>
0.41, and had a good feel. This three-dimensional<br>
knitted fabric was very suitable for inner sole<br>
materials of shoes and the like, bed pats of life<br>
materials and the like.<br>
Example 3<br>
Knitting was performed in the same manner as<br>
in Example 2 except that binding was performed with 1/2<br>
of needles as bind-knitting conditions. Knitting<br>
specifications and knitting characteristics in this<br>
case are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
The obtained three-dimensional knitted fabric<br>
had a thickness of 3.00 mm, a compressibility of 60%, a<br>
recovery ratio of 97.4% and an air permeability of<br>
0.55, and had a good feel. This three-dimensional<br>
knitted fabric was very suitable for inner sole<br>
materials of shoes and the like, bed pats of life<br>
materials and the like.<br>
Example 4<br>
Knitting was performed in the same manner as<br>
in Example 2 except that binding was performed with 1/4<br>
of needles as bind-knitting conditions. Knitting<br>
specifications and knitting characteristics in this<br>
case are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The obtained three-<br>
dimensional knitted fabric had a thickness of 2.85 mm,<br>
a compressibility of 71%, a recovery ratio of 91.6% and<br>
an air permeability of 0.62, and had a good feel. This<br><br>
three-dimensional knitted fabric was very suitable for<br>
inner sole materials of shoes and the like, bed pats of<br>

A circular knitting machine of 18 gage, 30<br>
inch diameter and 36 aperture (Mbdel Type OVJ-36<br>
manufactured by Mayer Cie Co., Ltd.) was used to knit a<br>
circular knitted fabric.<br>
As yarns for use in a front knitted fabric of<br>
the elastic circular knitted fabric, a cotton spun yarn<br>
No. 40 and a polyurethane elastic yarn of 22 decitexes<br>
(Roica® manufactured by Asahi Kas'ei Corporation) were<br>
used for the core, and an elastic yarn covered with a<br>
nylon finished yarn of 34 decitexes/12 filaments was<br>
arranged. A polyester false twist finished yarn of 167<br>
decitexes and 48 filaments (Technofine) was used as a<br>
yarn for use in the back knitted fabric, the knitted<br>
fabric of each face was formed into plain stitch, a<br>

A cotton spun yarn No. 40 was used as a yarn<br>
for use in a front knitted fabric of the stretchable<br>
knitted fabric, a polyester false twist finished yarn<br>
of 167 decitexes and 48 filaments (Technofine) was used<br>
as a yarn for use in a back knitted fabric, and when a<br>
knitted fabric of half-bag weaves was knitted, a bare<br><br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers of 1422<br>
decitexes (Roica) was inflation-inserted at a yarn<br>
feeding port of 1/2 to knit the fabric.<br>
At this time, the loop length of the bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers was 190 cm,<br>
the loop lengths of knitted fabrics constituting one<br>
face and the other face were both 760 cm, and the loop<br>
length ratio was 0.25.<br>
The obtained stretchable knitted fabric had a<br>
thickness of 0.80 mm, an elongation of 45% in the<br>
longitudinal direction and 100% in the lateral<br>
direction, elongation recovery rate of 60% in the<br>
longitudinal direction and 75% in the lateral<br>
direction, and a draw stress of 40 g. This stretchable<br>
knitted fabric was poor in elongation, and had poor<br>
handling characteristics with elastic fibers easily<br>
falling off during sewing operations.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A front knitted fabric and a back knitted<br>

direction, and an elastic fiber draw stress of 100 g,<br>
and had an irregular outline.<br>
This stretchable knitted fabric had a bad<br>
appearance with a binding yarn protruding from the<br>
surface, and was poor in stretchability and thus<br>
unsuitable as girdles for ladies.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
A stretchable knitted fabric was obtained in<br>
the same manner as in Example 5 except that a bare<br>
string of polyurethane based elastic fibers of 11<br>

and the second yarn feeding port were repeated at a<br>
fourth yarn feeding port and a fifth yarn feeding port,<br>
respectively, and at a sixth yarn feeding port, the<br>
polyurethane elastic yarn was fed to long butt needles<br>
for dial and cylinder needles as in the case of the<br>
third yarn feeding port.<br>
With this yarn as one complete weave, a<br>
fabric was knitted at 60 aperture yarn feeding port.<br>
Since connecting yarn was knitted in double tuck weaves<br>
with the short butt needle and the long butt needle<br>
alternately for each course, the stitch rate of the<br>
ground knitted fabric bound to the connecting yarn was<br>
50%, and the connection site was shifted in phase for<br>
each course.<br>
The obtained circular knitted grey fabric was<br>
opened, refined by a jet dyeing machine at 80°C for 30<br><br>
minutes, heat-treated at 190°C for 60 seconds while<br>
tentering by 5% in the width direction by a tenter<br>
finisher as a preset, and then dyed on the nylon side<br>
with an acid dye at 100°C for 60 minutes using a high<br>
pressure jet dyeing machine. The fabric was heat-<br>
treated at 170°C for 45 seconds while tentering by 3% in<br>
the width direction using a tenter finisher as a<br>
finishing set to obtain a dyed fabric.<br>
The obtained three-dimensional knitted fabric<br>
had a thickness of 1.8 mm, a knitting density of 25.5<br>
courses/cm x 14.6 wale/cm, a total connection number<br>
per square cm of 373, connecting yarn total decitexes<br>
per square cm of 57,780 decitexes, and D/T of 32,100.<br>
This elastic knitted fabric had a compressibility of<br>
54% and a recovery rate of 100%, and thus had<br>
sufficient compressibility. The knitted fabric had an<br>
air flow resistance of 0.24 kPa--s/m, and was<br>
sufficiently stretchable in both warp and weft<br>
directions of the knitted fabric, and completely<br>
reversible for back and front faces.<br>
Example 17<br>
A polyurethane elastic yarn of 78 decitexes<br>
(Roica® manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) was<br>
used alone in a bare state as polyurethane elastic<br>
fibers for a connecting yarn for binding ground knitted<br>
fabrics together, and a polyester gray yarn of 84<br>
decitexes/30 filaments (Technofine® manufactured by<br>
Asahi Kasei Corporation) and a polyurethane elastic<br><br>
yarn of 22 decitexes (Roica® manufactured by Asahi<br>
Kasei Corporation) were used in a bare state for front<br>
and back ground knitted fabrics. As a knitting<br>
machine, a double raschel warp knitting machine of 18<br>
gage provided with five guide bars (manufactured by<br>
Karl Mayer Co., Ltd.) with the distance between unit<br>
patterns set to 4 mm was used. The polyester gray yarn<br>
and the polyurethane elastic yarn for the ground<br>
knitted fabrics were fed to only a front needle from a<br>
first guide bar and a second guide bar to knit a double<br>
lxl tricot stitch weave. Two types of yarns were<br>
similarly fed to only a back needle from a fourth guide<br>
bar and a fifth guide bar to knit a half weave. From a<br>
third guide bar, a bare string of polyurethane elastic<br>
yarn was fed as a connecting yarn to both the front<br>
needle and back needle alternately in a full set, and a<br>
knit loop was knitted and connected to the ground<br>
knitted fabrics. The obtained warp knitted grey fabric<br>
was refined by a continuous refining machine at 80°C for<br>
30 minutes, heat-treated at 190°C for 60 seconds while<br>
tentering by 5% in the width direction by a tenter<br>
finisher as a preset, and then dyed at 130°C for 60<br>
minutes using a high pressure jet dyeing machine. The<br>
fabric was heat-treated at 170°C for 45 seconds while<br>
tentering by 3% in the width direction using a tenter<br>
finisher as a finishing set to obtain a dyed fabric.<br>
The obtained elastic knitted fabric had a<br>
thickness of 2.5 mm, a knitting density of 23.6<br><br>
courses/cm x 11.8 wale/cm, total connection number per<br>
square cm of 558, connecting yarn total decitexes per<br>
square cm of 43,524 decitexes, and D/T of 17,410.<br>
This elastic knitted fabric had a<br>
compressibility of 69% and a recovery rate of 99.4%,<br>
and thus had sufficient compressibility. The knitted<br>
fabric had a satisfactory air flow resistance of 0.33,<br>
and was sufficiently stretchable in both warp and weft<br>
directions of the knitted fabric. The obtained elastic<br>
knitted fabric was molded under dry heat conditions at<br>
180°C for 30 seconds using a rugged human face mold made<br>
of aluminum, resulting in a knitted fabric most<br>
suitable as an eye mask having a shape of a human face.<br>
Example 18<br>
A knitting machine same as that of Example 16<br>
was used, no elastic yarn was used for a back ground<br>
knitted fabric, and an elastic yarn having a<br>
polyurethane elastic' yarn of 22 decitexes (Roica®<br>
manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) as a core<br>
covered with a nylon finished yarn of 34 decitexes/12<br>
filaments was used for a front ground knitted fabric.<br>
In the same manner as in Example 16 for other aspects,<br>
this elastic yarn was arranged with non-elastic fibers<br>
at a rate of one of two of fibers to form a knitted<br>
fabric into plain stitch.<br>
The obtained elastic knitted fabric had a<br>
thickness of 2.0 mm, a knitting density of 18<br>
courses/cm x 11 wale/cm, total connecting yarn number<br><br>
per cm of 198, and D/T of 17,050. This elastic knitted<br>
fabric had a compressibility of 69% and a recovery rate<br>
of 99.9%, and thus had sufficient compressibility. The<br>
elastic knitted fabric was sufficiently stretchable in<br>
both warp and weft directions of the knitted fabric,<br>
and most suitable as upper materials for shoes and<br>
boots.<br>
Example 19<br>
A double circular knitting machine of 22G<br>
comprising a jacquard patterning mechanism with needle<br>
selection was used, a false twist finished yarn of<br>
nylon of 78 decitexes/34 filaments and a gray yarn of<br>
polyester 84 of decitexes/30 filaments were fed to the<br>
cylinder side to knit a flowered two-color jacquard and<br>
at the same time, a polyurethane elastic yarn of 44<br>
decitexes (Roica® manufactured by Asahi Kasei<br>
Corporation) was plated in a bare state to form a front<br>
ground knitted fabric.<br>
A gray yarn of polyester of 84 decitexes/30<br>
filaments was fed to the dial needle to knit a plain-<br>
knitted fabric and at the same time, a polyurethane<br>
elastic yarn of 44 decitexes (Roica® manufactured by<br>
Asahi Kasei Corporation) was plated in a bare state to<br>
form a back ground knitted fabric. The front and back<br>
two ground knitted fabrics were bound together by<br>
performing double tuck knitting alternately with a<br>
short butt needle and a long butt needle using a<br>
polyurethane elastic yarn of 310 decitexes (Roica®<br><br>
manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) as a<br>
connecting yarn in the same manner as in Example 16.<br>
The obtained circular knitted grey fabric was<br>
opened, refined by a jet dyeing machine at 80°C for 30<br>
minutes, heat-treated at 190°C for 60 seconds while<br>
tentering by 5% in the width direction by a tenter<br>
finisher as a preset, and then dyed on the nylon side<br>
with an acid dye at 100°C for 60 minutes using a high<br>
pressure jet dyeing machine. The fabric was heat-<br>
treated at 170°C for 45 seconds while tentering by 3% in<br>
the width direction using a tenter finisher as a<br>
finishing set to obtain a dyed fabric.<br>
The obtained knitted fabric had a thickness<br>
of 5 mm, a density of 28 courses/cm x 15 wale/cm, a<br>
connecting yarn total number of 420, and D/T of 26,040.<br>
This elastic knitted fabric had a compressibility of<br>
50% and a recovery rate of 100%, and thus had<br>
sufficient compressibility. The knitted fabric was<br>
sufficiently stretchable in both warp and weft<br>
directions, and had white stitches knitted with<br>
polyester on the surface, thus being most suitable for<br>
warm swimming suits having flowered patterns.<br>
Example 20<br>
In knitting an elastic knitted fabric of the<br>
present invention with similar yarn handling operations<br>
by a double raschel warp knitting machine used in<br>
Example 17, 80 course knitting was performed in the<br>
same manner as in Example 17 and in next 10 courses, a<br><br>
polyester gray yarn in a second guide bar was knitted<br>
with both front and back needles to form a knit loop,<br>
during which a connecting yarn was prevented from being<br>
connected to ground knitted fabrics, and inserted<br>
between two ground knitted fabrics in a float yarn<br>
state.<br>
Then, a return was made to the original<br>
knitted weave to perform knitting of 80 courses, and<br>
this operation was repeated. The obtained elastic<br>
knitted fabric had border-type irregularities with a<br>
three-dimensional site partitioned every 3 cm in the<br>
warp direction of the knitted fabric. This elastic<br>
knitted fabric had a recessed portion, and therefore<br>
could be easily bent on the whole, thus being most<br>
suitable for supporters and the like to be wound around<br>
the human body.<br>
Comparative Example 7<br>
Using a knitting machine same as that of<br>
Example 16, a knitted fabric was knitted with weaves<br>
and conditions same as those of Example 16. At this<br>
time, yarn handling for the ground knitted fabric was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 16, and a<br>
false twist finished yarn of polyester of 167<br>
decitexes/48 filaments was used as a binding yarn. The<br>
obtained knitted fabric was dye-finished using steps<br>
and conditions same as those of Example 16.<br>
This knitted fabric had a thickness of 2.2<br>
mm, a knitting density of 25.5 courses/cm x 14.6<br><br>
wale/cm, total connection number per square cm of 373,<br>
connecting yarn total decitexes per square cm of 62,291<br>
decitexes, and D/T of 22,246.<br>
This knitted fabric had a compressibility of<br>
62%, a recovery rate of 68.8%, and an air flow<br>
resistance of 0.64 kPa--s/m. The knitted fabric was<br>
sufficiently stretchable in both warp and weft<br>
directions of the knitted fabric, but was poor in<br>
elasticity when compressed in the thickness direction,<br>
and insufficient in compression recoverability such<br>
that it took much time for recovery from compression<br>
and permanent deformation remains on the surface of the<br>
knitted fabric for a long time. Furthermore, the<br>
knitted fabric was filled with fibers at the connection<br>
part and inferior in air permeability to the elastic<br>
fabric of the present invention. Further, this knitted<br>
fabric was dyed in a rope state, and thus had rope<br>
creases persistent on the surface of the knitted fabric<br>
after finish setting. When the knitted fabric was<br>
wound around the human body, bent creases occurred<br>
inside the knitted fabric along the curved line of the<br>
human body, and the creases never disappeared even<br>
after the knitted fabric was recovered to the original<br>
state.<br>
Comparative Example 8<br>
Using a knitting machine same as that of<br>
Example 16, a knitted fabric was knitted with weaves<br>
and conditions same as those of Example 1. At this<br><br>
time, no polyurethane elastic yarn was used for front<br>
and reserve ground knitted fabrics, and a cover elastic<br>
yarn having a polyurethane elastic yarn of 155<br>
decitexes as a core, around which a polyester core-<br>
sheathing type heat seal yarn of 167 decitexes/16<br>
filaments was wound, was used as a connecting yarn. At<br>
this time, the ratio of the covering draft of the<br>
elastic yarn was 2.5, and the number of twists of the<br>
cover yarn was 300 tiraes/m. Since the connecting yarn<br>
was a cover elastic yarn, a delivering apparatus to be<br>
used when knitting a well known polyurethane elastic<br>
yarn in a bare state, was not used.<br>
For other aspect, the knitted fabric was<br>
knitted and dye finishing was performed in the same<br>
manner as in Example 16. The obtained knitted fabric<br>
had a thickness of 1.4 mm, a knitting density of 14<br>
courses/cm x 11.5 wale/cm, total connection number per<br>
square cm of 161, connecting yarn total decitexes per<br>
square cm of 24,955 decitexes, and D/T of 17,825. This<br>
elastic knitted fabric had a compressibility of 58%, a<br>
recovery rate of 72.0%, and an air flow resistance of<br>
0.14 kPa—s/m.<br>
This knitted fabric had a small air flow<br>
resistance, but was so poor in compression<br>
recoverability in the thickness direction that plastic<br>
deformation occurred by compression. It was not a<br>
knitted fabric desired in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the connecting yarn was heat-sealed during<br><br>
dyeing, thus bringing about a satisfactory level of<br>
binding between the connecting yarn and the ground<br>
knitted fabric, but the heat-sealed part was hard, and<br>
the knitted fabric as a whole had a hard feel, and was<br>
hard to be bent, and the knitted fabric was thus<br>
unsuitable as a knitted fabric to be worn by a person<br>
or used at a location close to the skin as desired in<br>
the present invention. Furthermore, as in the case of<br>
Comparative Example 16, the knitted fabric had a<br>
disadvantage such that the inside ground knitted fabric<br>
was creased as the knitted fabric was bent.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
An elastic circular knitted fabric having a<br>
three-layer structure, and an elastic warp knitted<br>
fabric of the present invention are free from curling<br>
such that the year part of the knitted fabric is<br>
curled, excellent in form stability, and excellent in<br>
elongation recoverability, thinness feeling and surface<br>
quality. Furthermore, the present invention can<br>
provide an elastic knitted fabric having a good warp<br>
and weft elongation balance compared with a stretch<br>
gray yarn capable of being manufactured by a single<br>
circular knitting machine or single warp knitting<br>
machine of the prior art, and being most suitable for<br>
underwear, foundations, sport wear, supporters and the<br>
like. Furthermore, the size of polyurethane based<br>
elastic fibers can be selected and applied for each<br><br>
fabric having unprecedented stretchability in shape<br>
supplement applications.<br>
An elastic circular knitted fabric having a<br>
three-dimensional structure, and an elastic warp<br>
knitted fabric of the present invention are suitably<br>
used for shoe materials such as pad materials in shoes,<br>
upper materials for shoes and boots and slippers, bag<br>
materials such as bag fabrics and protection cases for<br>
glasses and cellular phones, pats such as bed pats,<br>
brassiere pats and shoulder pats, cover materials such<br>
as pillow covers, masks such as masks, eye masks and<br>
face masks, medical sub materials such as supporters,<br>
wound protection materials, protectors and diaper<br>
covers, leg materials such as tights, socks and leg<br>
warmers, sport cloths such as protective shorts,<br>
sliding shorts and jump shorts, underwear such as<br>
thermal insulation inners and tensile outer garments<br>
such as jumpers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
