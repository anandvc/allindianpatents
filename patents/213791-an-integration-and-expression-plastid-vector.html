FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application pertains to the field of genetic engineering of plant plastid genomes,<br>
particularly chloroplasts, and to methods of and engineered plants without the use of antibiotics.<br>
This application relates in particular to a method of selecting genetically engineered or<br>
transformed plants without the use of antibiotics as a selectable marker. The application also relates<br>
to a method of transforming plants to confer drought tolerance and to the transformed plants which<br>
are drought tolerant.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Publications<br>
Various methods of selection of plants that employ antibiotic-free selectable marker, or non-<br>
antibiotic selectable markers, have been described in the past.<br>
Briggs, in U.S. patent 5,589,611 (December 31,1996) entitled "Disease resistance gene from<br>
maize and its use for disease resistance as a selectable marker and as a gene identification probe,"<br>
proposed a method of identifying transformed plants which is disease resistant. A gene that controls<br>
resistance to both a fungus and a fungal disease toxin is proposed as a selectable marker to identify<br>
transformed plants, particularly in maize. An expression cassette containing the DNA sequence of<br>
a disease resistance gene, namely the Hm1 gene in maize, is inserted into the nucleic genome of the<br>
plant cells. The transformed plants will be capable of producing HC-toxin reductase. By culturing<br>
the cells in growth medium containing the corresponding toxin produced by the pathogen, namely<br>
Cocholiobolus carbonum Nelson race 1, the lethal selection of transformed plants will result.<br>
Ursin, in U.S. patent 5,633,153 (May27,1997) entitled "Aldehyde dehydrogenase selectable<br>
markers for plant transformation," proposed a method of using an aldehyde dehydrogenase as a<br>
selectable marker for nuclear transgenic plant cells. A DNA construct coded for an aldehyde<br>
dehydrogenase through eukaryotic promoters used for nuclear transformation and culturing such<br>
transformed cells in growth media containing the corresponding phytotoxic aldehyde, the transformed<br>
plants demonstrate resistance to the phytotoxic aldehyde.<br>
Song, in U.S. patent 5,965,727 (October 12, 1999), entitled "For selectable markers and<br>
promoters for plant tissue culture transformation," proposed transforming nuclear genome of plant<br>
cells with an expression cassette which contains DNA sequences coded for both the ASA2 promoter<br>
sequence of Nicotiana tabacum, or fragments thereof, that are capable of directing tissue culture<br>
specific expression. The ASA2 gene which is substantially resistant to inhibition by free L-Trp or an<br>
amino acid analog of Trp. When such cells are cultured in a medium containing an amount of an<br>
amino acid analog of Trp, successfully transformed plant cells survive.<br>
Several patents have also discussed the conferring of osmoprotection to plants through plant<br>
transformation. Adams, in U.S. patent 5,780,709 (July 14, 1998) entitled "Transgenic maize with<br>
increased mannitol content", proposed a method of conferring resistance to water or salt stress or<br>
altering the osmoprotectant content of a monocot plant by nucleic transformation. Transformation<br>
is accomplished via a vector containing an expression cassette comprised of a preselected DNA<br>
segment combined with a eukaryotic promoter functional in plant nucleus. Thus, the preselected<br>
DNA segment that was used to transform the monocot plants was the mtlD gene which encodes for<br>
the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of mannitol. Adams focused on the osmoprotective properties<br>
of sugar alcohols, specifically mannitol.<br>
Wu, in U.S. patent 5,981,842 (November 9, 1999), proposed that osmoprotection can be<br>
conferred upon cereal plants by transforming cereal plant cells or protoplasts with a promoter and<br>
a nucleic acid encoding a group 3 late embryogenesis protein (LEA protein) such as the HVA1 gene<br>
from barley. The transformed cereal plant accumulates HVA1 protein in both leaves and roots. The<br>
transformed plants showed an increase tolerance to drought and salt stress which correlated with the<br>
level of the HVA1 protein accumulated in the transformed plants.<br>
All publications and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disadvantages of the antibiotic selectable marker system. Most transformation techniques co-<br>
introduce a gene that confers antibiotic resistance, along with the gene of interest to impart a desired<br>
trait. Regenerating transformed cells in antibiotic containing growth media permits selection of only<br>
those cells that have incorporated the foreign genes as the gene of interest. Once transgenic plants<br>
are regenerated, antibiotic resistance genes serve no useful purpose but they continue to produce<br>
their gene products. One of the primary concerns of genetically modified (GM) crops is the presence<br>
of clinically important antibiotic resistance gene products in transgenic plants that could inactivate<br>
oral doses of the antibiotic (reviewed by Puchta 2000; Daniell 1999A). Another concern is that the<br>
antibiotic resistant genes could be transferred to pathogenic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract or<br>
soil rendering them resistant to treatment with such antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are one<br>
of the major challenges of modern medicine. In Germany, GM crops containing antibiotic resistant<br>
genes have been banned from release (Peerenboom 2000).<br>
Plastid genetic engineering as an alternative to nuclear genetic engineering. Plastid genetic<br>
engineering, particularly chloroplast genetic engineering, is emerging as an alternative new technology<br>
to overcome some of the environmental concerns of nuclear genetic engineering (reviewed by<br>
Bogorad, 2000). One common environmental concern is the escape of foreign gene through pollen<br>
or seed dispersal from transgenic crop plants to their weedy relatives creating super weeds or causing<br>
genetic pollution among other crops (Daniell 1999B). Keeler et al. (1996) have summarized valuable<br>
data on the weedy wild relatives of sixty important crop plants and potential hybridization between<br>
crops and wild relatives. Among sixty crops, only eleven do not have congeners and the rest of the<br>
crops have wild relatives somewhere in the world. In addition, genetic pollution among crops has<br>
resulted in several lawsuits and shrunk the European market of Canadian organic farmers (Hoyle<br>
1999). Several major food corporations have required segregation of native crops from those<br>
"polluted" with transgenes. Two legislations have been submitted in the U.S. to protect organic<br>
fanners whose crops inadvertently contain transgenes via pollen drift (Fox 2000). Maternal<br>
inheritance of foreign genes through chloroplast genetic engineering is highly desirable in such<br>
instances where there is potential for out-cross among crops or between crops and weeds (Daniell<br>
et al. 1998; Scott and Wilkinson 1999; Daniell 1999C).<br>
Yet another concern in the use of nuclear transgenic crops expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis<br>
(Bt) toxins is the sub-optimal production of toxins resulting in increased risk of pests developing Bt<br>
resistance. Plant-specific recommendations to reduce Bt resistance development include increasing<br>
Bt expression levels (high dose strategy), expressing multiple toxins (gene pyramiding), or expressing<br>
the protein only in tissues highly sensitive to damage (tissue specific expression). All three<br>
approaches are attainable through chloroplast transformation (Daniell 1999C). For example,<br>
hyperexpression of several thousand copies of a novel B.t. gene via chloroplast genetic engineering,<br>
resulted in 100% mortality of insects that are up to 40.000-fold resistant to other B.t. proteins (Kota<br>
et al. 1999). Another hotly debated environmental concern expressed recently is the toxicity of<br>
transgenic pollen to non-target insects, such as the Monarch butterflies (Losey et al. 1999; Hodgson<br>
1999). Although pollen from a few plants shown to exhibit maternal plastid inheritance contains<br>
metabolically active plastids, the plastid DN A itself is lost during the process of pollen maturation and<br>
hence is not transmitted to the next generation (reviewed in Heifetz, 2000, Bock and Hagmann,<br>
2000). Lack of insecticidal protein in transgenic pollen engineered via the chloroplast genome with<br>
the cry2 A gene has been demonstrated recently, even though chloroplast in leaves contained as much<br>
as 47% CRY protein, of. the total soluble protein (De Cosa et al. 2000V<br>
The need for alternatives to the antibiotic selectable marker system. Despite these advantages,<br>
one major disadvantage with chloroplast: genetic engineering in higher plants may be the utilization<br>
of the antibiotic resistance genes as the selectable marker to confer streptomycin/spectinomycin<br>
resistance. Initially, selection for chloroplast transformation utilized a cloned mutant 16S rRNA gene<br>
that does not bind the antibiotic and this conferred spectinomycin resistance (Svab et al. 1990).<br>
Subsequently, the aadA gene product that inactivates the antibiotic by transferring the adenyl moiety<br>
of ATP to spectinomycin /streptomycin was used (Svab and Maliga 1993). These antibiotics are<br>
commonly used to control bacterial infection in humans and animals. The probability of gene transfer<br>
from plants to bacteria living in the gastrointestinal tract or soil may be enhanced by the compatible<br>
protein synthetic machinery between chloroplasts and bacteria, in addition to presence of thousands<br>
of copies of the antibiotic resistance genes per cell. Also, most antibiotic resistance genes used in<br>
genetic engineering originate from bacteria.<br>
Because of the presence of thousands of antibiotic resistant genes in each cell of chloroplast<br>
transgenic plants and the use of the most commonly used antibiotics in the selection process, it is<br>
important to develop a chloroplast genetic engineering approach without the use of antibiotics.<br>
Non-obviousness of antibiotic free selection. Despite several advantages of plastid transformation,<br>
one major disadvantage with chloroplast genetic engineering in higher plants is the utilization of the<br>
antibiotic resistance genes as the selectable marker.Initially, selection for chloroplast transformation<br>
utilized a cloned mutant 16S rRNA gene that did not bind the antibiotic and this conferred<br>
spectinomycin resistance. Subsequently, the aadA gene was used as a selectable marker.<br>
Aminoglycoside 3 "-adenylyltransferase inactivates the antibiotic by transferring the adenyl moiety of<br>
ATP to spectinomycin/streptomycin. Unfortunately, bacterial infections in humans and animals are<br>
also controlled by using these antibiotics. The probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria<br>
living in the soil or gastrointestinal tract may be enhanced by the compatible protein synthetic<br>
machinery between chloroplasts and bacteria, in addition to presence of thousands of copies of the<br>
antibiotic resistance genes per cell. Also, most antibiotic resistance genes used in genetic engineering<br>
originate from bacteria.<br>
Prior to this invention, there was no report of modifying the plastid genome without the use<br>
of antibiotic selection. Daniell et al. (2001) reported the first genetic engineering of the higher plant<br>
chloroplast genome without the use of antibiotic selection. The betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase<br>
(BADH) gene from spinach was used as a selectable marker. The selection process involves<br>
conversion of toxic betaine aldehyde (BA) by the BADH enzyme to nontoxic glycine betaine, which<br>
also serves as an osmoprotectant. While it was known earlier that BADH was a plant enzyme, it<br>
could not be conclusively demonstrated that this was a chloroplast enzyme because it lacked the<br>
typical transit peptide found in all chloroplast proteins imported from the cytosol.<br>
The absence of a typical transit peptide raised several questions about proper cleavage of<br>
BADH enzyme in the stroma within plastids to be fully functional. It was not known whether the<br>
BADH enzyme would be catalytically active without proper cleavage within plastids.<br>
The nuclear BADH cDNA with high GC content was never anticipated to express well in the<br>
AT rich prokaryotic plastid compartment because the codon usage is very different between the<br>
prokaryotic chloroplast compartment and the eukaryotic nuclear compartment. Therefore, it was not<br>
obvious to express a nuclear gene in the plastid compartment.<br>
When the chloroplast transformation system was developed, it was hypothesized that the<br>
transformation process is possible only under non-lethal selection. Accumulation ofbetaine aldehyde<br>
is toxic and lethal to plant cells. Therefore, it was not clear whether non-lethal selection was required<br>
for chloroplast transformation. This invention has confirmed that the only requirement was that the<br>
selection process should be specific to plastids, particularly chloroplasts.<br>
Rapid regeneration of chloroplast transgenic plants obtained under BA selection was never<br>
anticipated or suggested in any prior art. Chloroplast transformation efficiency was 25 fold higher in<br>
BA selection than spectinomycin and this was never anticipated in any previous investigations. Higher<br>
efficiency of betaine aldehyde selection compared to spectinomycin should facilitate chloroplast<br>
transformation of many economically important crops, including cereals that are naturally resistant<br>
to spectinomycin, in addition to conferring salt/drought tolerance.<br>
Use of genes that are naturally present in spinach for selection, in addition to gene<br>
containment, should ease public concerns regarding GM crops.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides for a method to circumvent the problem of genetic pollution through<br>
plastid transformation and the use antibiotic-free selectable markers. Antibiotic-free phytotoxic<br>
agents and their corresponding detoxifying enzymes or proteins are used as a system of selection,<br>
hi particular, the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) gene from spinach has been used as a<br>
selectable marker. This enzyme is present only in chloroplasts of a few plant species adapted to dry<br>
and saline environments. The selection process involves conversion of toxic betaine aldehyde (BA)<br>
by the chloroplast BADH enzyme to nontoxic glycine betaine (GB), which also serves as an<br>
osmoprotectant.<br>
The preferred embodiment of this invention provides a method of selecting plant<br>
transformants using a plastid vector that includes a promoter targeted to the plastid, a DNA sequence<br>
encoding a gene of interest, another DNA sequence encoding a selectable marker such as an aldehyde<br>
dehydrogenase, and a terminator sequence. The transformed plants are selected by allowing<br>
transformed plants to grow in medium with the effective amount of a phytotoxin which is detoxified<br>
by the encoded aldehyde dehydrogenase. Lethal selection of the plants transformants will result.<br>
It is another embodiment of this invention, the vector is targeted to plant chloroplasts. This<br>
embodiment can be carried out using both the universal chloroplast vector and a vector which is<br>
universal. Preferably, the vector includes a ribosome binding site and a 5" untranslated region (5"<br>
UTR. A promoter functional in green or non-green plastids is to be used in conjunction with the<br>
5"UTR.<br>
The invention provides the application of a wide variety of plants species and plant parts,<br>
including flowers, fruits, cereals, and all major crop plants.<br>
The invention also provides for the plants transformants engineered and selected a antibiotic-<br>
free selectable marker with preferably a target heterologous DNA sequence.<br>
The invention also provides for a method of conferring drought tolerance to plants with a<br>
antibiotic-free selectable marker. The plants or plant cells are transformed through the chloroplast<br>
by a vector containing a promoter targeted to the chloroplast, a DNA sequence encoding betaine<br>
aldehyde dehydrogenase, DNA sequences encoding at least one gene of interest, and a terminator<br>
sequence. The transformed plants are selected by allowing transformed plants to grow in medium<br>
with the effective amount of a phytotoxin which is detoxified by the encoded aldehyde<br>
dehydrogenase. Lethal selection of the plants transformants will result. The plants so transformed<br>
will be capable of glycine betaine production that leads to enhanced drought tolerance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention discloses a novel way of selecting transformed plants, wherein the plant"s<br>
plastid genome is transformed via a vector targeted to the plastid, and the selectable markers used<br>
for such transformation is a antibiotic-free marker. The invention further consists of the plants<br>
transformed and selected using the present method. The invention also discloses a method to confer<br>
osmoprotection to plants through chloroplast transformation.<br>
The present invention is applicable to all plastids of plants. These include chromoplasts which<br>
are present in the fruits, vegetables and flowers; amyloplasts which are present in tubers like the<br>
potato; proplastids in roots; leucoplasts and etioplasts, both of which are present in non-green parts<br>
of plants.<br>
The Vectors. This invention contemplates the use of vectors capable of plastid transformation,<br>
particularly of chloroplast transformation. Such vectors would include chloroplast expression vectors<br>
such as pUC, pBR322, pBlueScript, pGEM, and all others identified by Daniell in U.S. patent no.<br>
5,693,507 and U.S. patent no. 5,932,479. Included are also vectors whose flanking sequence is<br>
located outside the inverted repeat of the chloroplast genome. These publications and patents are<br>
herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent was<br>
specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention utilizes a universal integration and expression vector<br>
competent for stably transforming the chloroplast genome of different plant species (Universal<br>
Vector). A universal vector is described in WO 99/10513 which was published on March 4,1999,<br>
which is herein incorporated in its entity.<br>
The vector pLD-BADH was constructed by generating a PCR product using spinach cDNA<br>
clone as the template. The 5" primer also included the chloroplast optimal ribosome binding site<br>
(GGAGG). PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRl site of pLD-CtV, resulting in pLD-BADH.<br>
BADH is one of the few proteins targeted to the chloroplast that lacks a definite transit peptide<br>
(Rathinasabapathi et al 1994). Authors suggest that information for transport may be contained<br>
within the mature protein. Even if a transit peptide was present, it should be cleaved in the stroma<br>
by the stromal processing peptidase (Keegstra and Cline, 1999). Furthermore, nuclear encoded<br>
cytosolic proteins with transit peptides have been successfully expressed within chloroplasts and<br>
found to be fully functional (Daniell et al. 1998). Therefore there was no need to delete any transit<br>
peptide.<br>
The universal vector, pLD-BADH, as shown in Figure 1, integrates the aadA and BADH<br>
genes into the 16S-23S-spacer region of the chloroplast genome. Expression cassettes of the<br>
chloroplast integration vector contain the chimeric aadA gene and the BADH gene driven by the<br>
constitutive 16S rRNA promoter and regulated by the 3" untranslated region of the plastid psbA gene.<br>
The chimeric aadA gene encoding aminoglycoside 3"adenyltransferase confers spectinomycin<br>
resistance in chloroplasts enabling selection of the transformants on spectinomycin dihydrochloride.<br>
On the other hand, BADH converts the toxic betaine aldehyde in cells to glycine betaine. When<br>
present, this pathway is compartmentalized within chloroplasts (Nuccio, et al. 1999). To facilitate<br>
translation of the dicistronic mRNA, independent Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences were provided to<br>
the aadA and BADH genes upstream of the initiation codons. In order to accurately compare<br>
transformation efficiency of both selectable markers under identical bombardment and transformation<br>
conditions, aadA and BADH genes were inserted into the same vector, at the same site. Bombarded<br>
leaves were treated in identical manner except the addition of selection reagent.<br>
Other plant specific vectors can be used to transform the plastids, particularly chloroplast, of<br>
various crops for betaine aldehyde selection. Some examples of these include the pLD-Alfa-BADH<br>

Promoters. For transcription and translation of the DNA sequence encoding the gene of interest,<br>
the entire promoter region from a gene capable of expression in the plastid generally is used. The<br>
promoter region may include promoters obtained from green and non-green chloroplast genes that<br>
are operative upon the chloroplast, such as the psbA gene from spinach or pea, the rbcL, atpB<br>
promoter region from maize, the accD promoter and 16S rRNA promoter. Competent promoters<br>
are also described in U.S. patent 5,693,507, and the other literature sources contained therein. These<br>
publications and patents are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual<br>
publication or patent was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.<br>
Selectable markers. The preferred embodiment of this invention teaches the use of the spinach<br>
BADH gene as a selectable marker; wherein a plant is transformed via the chloroplast with the<br>
spinach BADH gene along with another nucleotide sequence encoding a desirable trait. The BADH<br>
gene product - betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase"- will oxidize the betaine aldehyde in the growth<br>
medium allowing for the lethal selection of transformed plants.<br>
Other forms of Antibiotic-Free Selection. Enzymes and proteins that function in plastids can be<br>
used as antibiotic-free phytotoxic agents. In case of amino acid biosynthesis, the synthesis is<br>
regulated by the substrate. When adequate amino acid is made, it binds to one of the enzymes in the<br>
pathway to block further synthesis (feed back inhibition). Mutant genes are available for many<br>
enzymes that are insensitive to such feed back inhibition. Such enzymes are expressed in the<br>
chloroplast by engineering feed back insensitive mutant genes via the chloroplast genome. Putative<br>
transgenic shoots are regenerated in a growth medium lacking specific amino acids. True transgenic<br>
plants will be regenerated in the growth medium. Thus, antibiotic free selection is accomplished.<br>
Pigment biosynthesis can also be used in antibiotic free selection in plastids. While ancient<br>
plants (including pines) have the ability to synthesize chloroplhyll in the dark, flowering plants lost<br>
this capacity. This is because of the last step in chlorophyll biosynthesis is controlled by the enzyme<br>
protochlorophyllide reductase. This enzyme can function in the dark in primitive land plants and<br>
certain algae but is light dependent in higher plants. That is why ornamental plants kept inside the<br>
house requires light to synthesize chlorophyll. It is known that the chloroplast gene (chlB) for<br>
protochlorophyllide reductase in the green alga Chlamydomonas is required for light independent<br>
protochlorophyllide reductase activity (Plant Cell 5: 1817-1829). Therefore, chlB gene from the<br>
Chlamydomonas chloroplast is introduced into the chloroplast genome of higher plants and transgenic<br>
green shoots appearing in the dark is selected. Thus, pigment biosynthesis genes are used as<br>
antibiotic free selectable markers.<br>
Another possibility is herbicide selection. Several methods can be used to genetically engineer<br>
herbicide resistance via the chloroplast genome. The target enzyme or protein is overproduced with<br>
10,000 copies of foreign genes per transformed cell. This results in binding of all herbicide molecules<br>
thereby facilitating regeneration of transgenic shoots. Another approach is the use of modified<br>
enzyme or proteins (mutant) that does not bind the herbicide. The third approach is to use enzymes<br>
or proteins to breakdown the herbicide.<br>
Drought tolerance likewise can be used as a selectable marker. Expression of the BADH<br>
enzyme or trehalose phosphate synthase via the chloroplast genome enables cells to tolerate drought.<br>
Drought conditions are created in culture plates by the addition of polyethylene glycol to the growth<br>
medium (3-6%). Only cells that express BADH or TPS are capable of drought tolerance and grows<br>
in the presence of polyethylene glycol. Thus, antibiotic free chloroplast transgenic plants are<br>
obtained.<br>
Other Aldehyde Dehydrogenases. Other genes that code for an aldehyde dehydrogenase capable<br>
of detoxifying other phytotoxic aldehydes can be used in this novel selection system. These include,<br>
and are not limited to, genes that encode acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase,<br>
proprionaldehyde dehydrogenase, and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase.<br>
Plastid Transformation<br>
The transformation of this invention maybe accomplished by any methods of transformation<br>
known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to PEG treatment, Agrobacterium<br>
treatment, and microinjection. Methods of transformation are described by Daniell et. al., "New<br>
Tools for Chloroplast Genetic Engineering," Nat. Biotechnology, 17:855-857 (1999). This<br>
publication is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
method for transformation is by bombardment.<br>
The BADH gene expression was tested in E. coli cell extracts by enzyme assays before<br>
proceeding with bombardment. The universal vector pLD-BADH was transformed into the E. coli<br>
strain XL-1 Blue and grown in Terrific Broth (Guda et al. 2000) in the presence of ampicillin (100<br>
µg/ml) at 37°C for 24 hours. In E. coli, the level of expression by the chloroplast Prrn promoter is<br>
equivalent to that of the highly efficient T7 promoter and both systems have highly compatible<br>
protein synthetic machinery (Brixey et al. 1997). Therefore, BADH enzyme activity was tested in<br>
untransformed cells and cells transformed with pLD-BADH, a high copy number plasmid (Figure 2).<br>
Crude sonic extracts isolated from transformed cells showed 3-5 fold more BADH activity than the<br>
untransformed control, confirming that the expression cassette is fully functional. This result also<br>
suggests that codon preference of the nuclear BADH gene is compatible with expression in the<br>
prokaryotic chloroplast compartment.<br>
Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Petit Havana) was grown aseptically by germination of<br>
seeds in MSO medium. This medium contains MS salts (4.3 g/liter), B5 vitamin mixture<br>
(myoinositol, 100 mg/liter; thiamine-HCI, 10 mg/liter; nicotinic acid, 1 mg/liter; pyridoxine-HCI, 1<br>
mg/liter), sucrose (30 g/liter) and phytagar (6 g/liter) at pH 5.8. Fully expanded, dark green leaves<br>
of about two month old plants were used for bombardment.<br>
Leaves were placed abaxial side up on Whatman No. 1 filter papers laying on the RMOP<br>
medium (Daniell 1993) in standard petri plates (100x15 mm) for bombardment. Microprojectiles<br>
were coated with plasmid DNA (pLD-B ADH) and bombardments were carried out with the biolistic<br>
device PDS1000/He (Bio-Rad) as described by Daniell (1997). Following bombardment, petri plates<br>
were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 24°C under 16 hour photoperiod. Two days after<br>
bombardment, leaves were chopped into small pieces of ~5 mm2 in size and placed on the selection<br>
medium (RMOP containing 500 p.g/ml of spectinomycin dihydrochloride or 5-10 mM betaine<br>
aldehyde) with abaxial side touching the medium in deep (100x25 mm) petri plates. The regenerated<br>
resistant shoots were chopped into small pieces (~2mm2) and subcloned into fresh deep petri plates<br>
containing the same selection medium. Resistant shoots from the second culture cycle were<br>
transferred to the rooting medium (MSO medium supplemented with IBA, 1 mg/liter containing<br>
appropriate selectable marker). Rooted plants were transferred to soil and grown at 26°C under 16<br>
hour photoperiod.<br>
Selection and heightened, rapid regeneration of homoplasmic transgenic plants.<br>
The entire process of regeneration, starting from bombardment until transfer to soil, takes<br>
about 3-6 months for spectinomycin selection and 2-3 months for betaine aldehyde selection. Figure<br>
3 and Table 1 show differences between the two selection processes. Under spectinomycin selection,<br>
leaf discs continued to grow but pigments were bleached; resistant clones formed green shoots in<br>
about 45 days (Figure 3B). On the other hand, under betaine aldehyde selection, growth of the leaf<br>
discs was completely inhibited and photosynthetic pigments were degraded (Figure 3G-1), resistant<br>
clones formed green shoots within 12 days (Figure 3E). Leaf disks in Figure 3 under betaine<br>
aldehyde selection appear partially green because they were photographed 12 days after the initiation<br>
of the selection process whereas the disc photographed on spectinomycin were 45 days after initiation<br>
of the selection process. In spite of the short period of selection one leaf disk was almost bleached<br>
(Fig 3D) and all of them were killed after 30 days. Under 10mM betaine aldehyde selection, control<br>
untransformed samples were killed (turned black, 3G-1) whereas transgenic leaves produced new<br>
shoots (Figure 3G, 2-4).<br>
When the leaf discs were selected for spectinomycin resistance, only 15% of the discs<br>
responded and an average of one resistant shoot per plate was observed after 45 days. From each<br>
callus, all resistant shoots are considered to represent an individual clone. Under betaine aldehyde<br>
selection 80% of the discs responded and an average of 25 resistant shoots per plate was observed.<br>
Responding leaf disks formed one or two resistant shoots under spectinomycin selection whereas<br>
under betaine aldehyde selection, as many as 23 shoots were observed from a single leaf disk.<br>
Overall, 10 resistant shoots were regenerated from ten bombardments under spectinomycin selection<br>
while more than 150 shoots were recovered from six bombardments under betaine aldehyde selection.<br>
Therefore, the efficiency of transformation is 25 fold higher in betaine aldehyde selection than<br>
spectinomycin selection. Additionally, the latter procedure results in rapid regeneration.<br>
Lethal Selection. The prior art suggests that chloroplast transformation system is possible only<br>
under non-lethal selection (Svab and Maliga 1993). This invention distinctly shows that this is not<br>
the case. Non-lethal selection was defined in the chloroplast transformation literature as lack of<br>
suppression of growth on the selection medium and that this was an absolute requirement for plastid<br>
transformation (Staub and Maliga 1993). It is known that accumulation of betaine aldehyde is toxic<br>
and lethal to plant cells (Rathinasabapathi et. al. 1994). This invention confirm earlier observations<br>
that betaine aldehyde is toxic to plant cells and inhibits growth. Therefore, this invention teaches that<br>
non-lethal selection is not a requirement for plastid transformation. The only requirement is that the<br>
selection process should be specific to plastids.<br>
Confirmation of chloroplast integration, homoplasmy and copy number.<br>
Integration of a foreign gene into the chloroplast genome was confirmed by PCR screening<br>
of chloroplast transformants (Figure 4). Primers were designed to eliminate mutants, nuclear<br>
integration and to determine whether the integration of foreign genes had occurred in the chloroplast<br>
genome at the directed site by homologous recombination. The strategy to distinguish between<br>
nuclear and chloroplast transgenic plants was to land one primer (3P) on the native chloroplast<br>
genome adjacent to the point of integration and the second primer (3M) on the aadA gene (Figure<br>
1). This primer set generated 1.6 kb PCR product in chloroplast transformants (Figure 4). Because<br>
this product cannot be obtained in nuclear transgenic plants, the possibility of nuclear integration can<br>
be eliminated. PCR screening for chloroplast transformants after the first culture cycle showed that<br>
11 out of 15 betaine aldehyde resistant clones integrated foreign genes into the chloroplast genome.<br>
The rest of the resistant shoots may be either escapes or nuclear transformants. Hence, only PCR<br>
positive clones were advanced to further steps of regeneration. In contrast, nearly 60% of the<br>
spectinomycin resistant clones were mutants. Other labs have recently reported as high as 90%<br>
mutants among spectinomycin resistant clones (Eibl et al. 1999; Sidorov et al. 1999).<br>
Southern blot analysis was performed using total DNA isolated from transgenic and wild type<br>
tobacco leaves. Total DNA was digested with a suitable restriction enzyme. Presence of a Bglll cut<br>
site at the 3" end of the flanking 16S rRNA gene and the trnA intron allowed excision of predicted<br>
size fragments in the chloroplast transformants and untransformed plants. To confirm foreign gene<br>
integration and homoplasmy, individual blots were probed with the flanking chloroplast DNA<br>
sequence (probe 1, Figure 5 A), hi the case of the BADH integrated plastid transformants, the border<br>
sequence hybridized with a 7.29 kbp fragment while it hybridized with a native 4.47 kbp fragment<br>
in the untransformed plants (Figure 5B). The copy number of the integrated BADH gene was also<br>
determined by establishing homoplasmy in transgenic plants (Daniell etal. 1998; Gudaetal. 2000).<br>
Tobacco chloroplasts contain about 10,000 copies of chloroplast genomes per cell. If only a fraction<br>
of the genomes was transformed, the copy number should be less than 10,000. By confirming that<br>
the BADH integrated genome is the only one present in transgenic plants, it could be established that<br>
the BADH gene copy number could be as many as 10,000 per cell.<br>
DNA gel blots were also probed with the BADH gene coding sequence (P2) to confirm<br>
specific integration into the chloroplast genomes and eliminate transgenic plants that had foreign<br>
genes also integrated into the nuclear genome. In the case of the BADH integrated plants, the<br>
BADH coding sequence hybridized with a 7.29 kbp fragment which also hybridized with the border<br>
sequence in plastid transformant lines (Figure 5B). This shows that the BADH gene was integrated<br>
only into the chloroplast genome and not the nuclear genome in transgenic lines examined in this blot.<br>
Also, this confirms that the tobacco transformants indeed integrated the intact gene expression<br>
cassette into the chloroplast genome and that no internal deletions or loop outs during integration<br>
occurred via homologous recombination.<br>
Osmoprotection.<br>
In higher plants accumulation of osmoprotectants during salinity and drought stress is a<br>
common phenomenon in their metabolic adaptation. Osmoprotectants help to protect plant<br>
organelles from osmotic shock as well as the cellular membranes from damage during stress (Nuccio<br>
et al. 1999). Among the osmoprotectants, glycine betaine is the most effective and is commonly<br>
present in a few families, including Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae. But most of the crop species<br>
including tobacco do not accumulate glycine betaine. Since synthesis and localization of glycine<br>
betaine is compartmentalized in chloroplasts, engineering the chloroplast genome for glycine betaine<br>
synthesis may provide an added advantage for chloroplast transgenic plants. B ADH converts toxic<br>
betaine aldehyde to non-toxic glycine betaine which is the second step in the formation of glycine<br>
betaine from choline. By analyzing BADH enzyme activity, the expression of introduced BADH<br>
gene can be monitored. Since BADH is a NAD+ dependent, enzyme activity is analyzed for the<br>
formation NADH. The reaction rate is measured by an increase in absorbency at 340 nm resulting<br>
from the reduction of NAD+.<br>
BADH enzyme activity was assayed in crude leaf extracts of wild type and transgenic plants.<br>
Unlike previous reports, no purification with ammonium sulfate was necessary in order to perform<br>
the BADH assay. Crude extracts from chloroplast transgenic plants showed elevated activity (15-18<br>
fold) compared to the untransformed tobacco (Figure 6). The wild type tobacco showed low<br>
endogenous activity as reported previously (Rathinasababathy et al. 1994). BADH enzyme activity<br>
was investigated from young (top 3-4 leaves), mature (large well developed), developing leaves (in<br>
between young and mature) and bleached old leaves from transgenic plants. Crude leaf extracts from<br>
different developmental stages of the same transgenic plant showed differential activity with the most<br>
activity observed in mature leaves (18 fold over control) and least activity in older leaves (15 fold<br>
over control, as seen in Figure 6). Unlike nuclear transgenic lines, crude extracts from different<br>
chloroplast transgenic lines did not show significant variation in BADH activity (data not shown).<br>
Lack of pleiotropic effects. Expression of BADH and resultant accumulation of glycine betaine did<br>
not result in any pleiotropic effects; transgenic plants are morphologically indistinguishable from<br>
control untransformed plants (Figure 7). They grew normally, flowered and set seeds. Germination<br>
of seeds from untransformed plants in the presence of spectinomycin resulted in complete bleaching<br>
whereas seeds from the chloroplast transgenic plants germinated and grew normally (Figure 8).<br>
Because untransformed seeds germinated in very high concentrations of betaine aldehyde (10-15<br>
mM), no comparison between control and transgenic seeds could be made during germination on<br>
betaine aldehyde. This may be due to the presence of an active endogenous BADH or similar<br>
enzymatic activity in non-green plastids during germination. These results demonstrate that the<br>
introduced trait is stably inherited in the subsequent generation and that it is safe to use betaine<br>
aldehyde selection because of the lack of pleiotropic effects.<br>
Application to Other Plants. This invention applies to any higher plants, such as<br>
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species. The plants that may be transformed via the<br>
universal vector with a antibiotic-free selectable marker maybe solanacious plants or plants that grow<br>
underground. Most importantly, this invention is applicable to the major economically important<br>
crops such as maize, rice, soybean, wheat, and cotton. A non-exclusive list of examples of higher<br>
plants which maybe so transformed include cereals such as barley, corn, oat, rice, and wheat; melons<br>
such as cucumber, muskmelon, and watermelon; legumes such as bean, cowpea, pea, peanut; oil<br>
crops such as canola and soybean; solanaceous plants such as tobacco; tuber crops such as potato<br>
and sweet potato; and vegetables like tomato, pepper and radish; fruits such as pear, grape, peach,<br>
plum, banana, apple and strawberry; fiber crops like the Gossypium genus such as cotton, flax and<br>
hemp; and other plants such as beet, cotton, coffee, radish, commercial flowing plants, such as<br>
carnation and roses; grasses, such as sugar cane or turfgrass; evergreen trees such as fir, spruce, and<br>
pine, and deciduous trees, such as maple and oak.<br>
The invention is exemplified in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A. Betaine Aldehyde Selection of Tobacco Chloroplast Transformation. Tobacco<br>
plant chloroplasts were transformed by the universal vector containing both a targeted gene of<br>
interest and the spinach betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene. The transformed cells were cultured<br>
in growth medium containing betaine aldehyde, a phytotoxic aldehyde. Since betaine aldehyde is<br>
lethal to all untransformed cells, such cells will not be regenerated in the growth medium. Therefore,<br>
all cells which grow in the growth medium containing betaine aldehyde are successfully transformed<br>
with the BADH gene. More importantly, such cells are successfully transformed with the targeted<br>
gene of interest.<br>
B. Other possible plants. Other than tobacco, this invention can be practiced upon<br>
other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, including maize, rice, soybean, wheat, cotton,<br>
oat, barley, cucumber, muskmelon, watermelon, bean, cowpea, pea, peanut, canola, potato and sweet<br>
potato; tomato, pepper, radish, pear, grape, peach, plum, banana, apple, strawberry, flax, hemp, beet,<br>
coffee, radish, commercial flowing plants, such as carnation and roses; grasses, such as sugar cane<br>
or turfgrass; fir, spruce, and pine, maple and oak.<br>
C. Other antibiotics that can be replaced. This example provides that the<br>
invention can replace all antibiotics as a selectable marker, including those listed in Molecular<br>
Biotechnology by Glick and Pasternak, page 437, Table 17.4.<br>
D. Other targeted genes of interest. This invention provides that genes of interest<br>
expressing desirable traits are encoded by the targeted DNA sequence in the expression cassette.<br>
Example 2<br>
Other antibiotic-free phytotoxic agents include phytotoxic aldehydes such as<br>
acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, proprionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde; herbicides such as triazines<br>
and cyanamide, including those listed in Molecular Biotechnology by Glick and Pasternak, page<br>
459, Table 18.4. Also useful is light selection.<br>

Example 5<br>
Other chloroplast vectors may be used in lieu of the universal vector, including those<br>
listed in U. S. patents 5693507 and 5932479 to Daniell.<br>

Insulin, Human Serum Albumin, and Herbicide glyphosate. Other genes of interest include, but<br>
are not limited to the aminoglycosides listed in "Aminoglycosides: A Practical Review" by<br>
