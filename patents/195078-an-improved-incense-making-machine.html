4<br><br>
As shown in Figs 1 and 2, the main transmission device 6 includes a first motor 61 which rotates a drive wheel 611 which meshes with a chain 612 to rotate a sprocket 613 which is secured on the wheel axle 62 which rotates a sprocket 631 which meshes with a chain 632 which meshes with an idler 633 to rotate a sprocket 634 and a sprocket 635 which meshes with a chain 636 which meshes with a driven sprocket 12 which rotates the rotary disk 1 at a low constant speed<br>
On the other hand, the sprocket 641 secured on the wheel axle 62 meshes with a chain 642 which meshes with a sprocket 643 and passes through the inner side wheels 71 of the drive wheels 7 located at the lower half portion of the rotary disk 1 The chain 642 then passes through a sprocket 644 secured on the wheel axle 81, and passes through an inner wheel 911 of a first idler 91 and an inner wheel 921 of a second idler 92, and finally connects with the sprocket 641 so as to rotate the drive wheels 7 located at the lower half portion of the rotary disk 1 along the reverse counterclockwise direction<br>
As shown in Figs 1 and 3, the secondary transmission device 8 is used to rotate the drive wheels 7 located at the upper half portion of the rotary disk 1 along the positive clockwise direction<br>
The secondary transmission device 8 includes a second motor 82 serving as a power source to rotate a main drive wheel 821 which meshes with a chain 822 to rotate a sprocket 823 which rotates the wheel axle 81 which rotates a sprocket 841 which meshes with a chain 842 An electromagnetic clutch 83 is mounted on the wheel axle 81 and located beside the sprocket 823<br>
5<br><br>
The chain 842 rotates an outer wheel 912 of the first idler 91 and an outer wheel 922 of the second idler 92 The chain 842 then rotates a sprocket 843 which is secured on the wheel axle 62 The chain 842 then passes through the outer side wheels 72 of the drive wheels 7 located at the upper half portion of the rotary disk 1 to rotate the drive wheels 7 located at the upper half portion of the rotary disk 1 along the positive clockwise.<br>
