[0001]     This   application   claims   the   benefit   of   U.S.   Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/909,087 filed on March 30, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed automatic<br>
transmission having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque<br>
transmitting devices and more particularly to an eight speed automatic<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]     The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed automatic transmission uses a<br>
combination of friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0033] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0034] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the members of the four planetary gear sets. These permanent mechanical<br>
connections relate the transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first<br>
component or member of a first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
ground, stationary member, or transmission housing. A second component or<br>
member of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or member of a third planetary gear set. A third component or<br>
member of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a second<br>
component or member of a second planetary gear set. Finally, a first component<br>
or member of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first<br>
component or member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
automatic transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever<br>
diagram is a schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device<br>
such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary<br>
gear set wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear<br>
are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001055-PTT-DLT<br>
for the ring gear member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever<br>
can be used to represent the ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These<br>
lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order<br>
to achieve an appropriate ratio and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or<br>
interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are<br>
illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as<br>
clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a<br>
brake, one set of the fingers is grounded. Further explanation of the format,<br>
purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The<br>
Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising,<br>
which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0036] The automatic transmission 10 includes an input shaft or<br>
member 12, a first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a<br>
second node 14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having<br>
three nodes: a first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third<br>
planetary gear set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B<br>
and a third node 18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 20A, a second node 20B and a third node 20C, and an output shaft or<br>
member 22.<br>
[0037] The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to<br>
a ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40. The second node 14B<br>
of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the second node 16B of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16.   The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001055-PTT-DLT<br>
coupled to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node<br>
16A of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the first node 18A of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the first<br>
node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The output shaft or member 22 is<br>
coupled to the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18.<br>
[0038] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the first node 20A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20 to the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set<br>
14 and to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. A second clutch<br>
28 selectively connects the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 to<br>
the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30<br>
selectively connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 and<br>
the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 20B of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the first<br>
node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 and the first node 18A of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
Finally, a first brake 34 selectively connects the third node 20C of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40.<br>
[0039] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>

Attorney Docket No. P001055-PTT-DLT<br>
third sun gear member 18A and the second sun gear member 16A. The fourth<br>
clutch 32 selectively couples the fourth planet carrier member 20C to the third<br>
sun gear member 18A and the second sun gear member 16A. The brake 34<br>
selectively couples the fourth planet carrier member 20C to the first sun gear<br>
member 14A and to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 40 in<br>
order to restrict rotation of the fourth planet carrier member 20C relative to the<br>
transmission housing 40. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to the third<br>
ring gear member 18B.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 10 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the torque transmitting devices as will be explained below. FIG.<br>
3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque transmitting<br>
devices that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 10.<br>
[0044] To establish gear ratios, three torque transmitting devices are<br>
engaged for each gear state.   The engaged torque transmitting devices are<br>
15<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001055-PTT-DLT<br>
represented by an "X" in each respective row. For example, to establish reverse<br>
gear, the brake 34, the first clutch 26, and the second clutch 28 are engaged or<br>
activated. The first brake 34 selectively couples the fourth planet carrier member<br>
20C to the first sun gear member 14A and to ground, stationary member, or<br>
transmission housing 40 in order to restrict rotation of the fourth planet carrier<br>
member 20C relative to the transmission housing 40. The first clutch 26<br>
selectively couples the input shaft 12 and the fourth sun gear member 20A to the<br>
third planet carrier member 18C, and the first planet carrier member 14C. The<br>
second clutch 28 selectively couples the fourth ring gear member 20B to the<br>
second ring gear member 16C. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved<br>
through different combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0045] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 10 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts,<br>
i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or<br>
brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>

122 is coupled to the second node 114B of the first planetary gear set 114.<br>
[0048] A first clutch 126 selectively connects the first node 120A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 120 to the first node 118A of the third planetary gear set<br>
118 and to the first node 116A of the second planetary gear set 116. A second<br>

gear set 120 to the second node 118B of the third planetary gear set 118. A third<br>
clutch 130 selectively connects the third node 116C of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116 to the second node 120B of the fourth planetary gear set 120. A fourth<br>
clutch 132 selectively connects the third node 116C of the second planetary gear<br>
set 116 to the third node 120C of the fourth planetary gear set 120. Finally, a<br>
brake 134 selectively connects the third node 120C of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 120 to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 140.<br>

[0053] Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 will be described. It<br>
will be appreciated that the automatic transmission 100 is capable of transmitting<br>
torque from the input shaft or member 112 to the output shaft or member 122 in<br>
eight forward speed or torque ratios and one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
20<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P001055-PTT-DLT<br>
one or more of the torque transmitting devices as will be explained below. FIG.<br>
6 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque transmitting<br>
devices that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the automatic transmission 100.<br>
[0054] To establish gear ratios, three torque transmitting devices are<br>
engaged for each gear state. The engaged torque transmitting devices are<br>
represented by an "X" in each respective row. For example, to establish reverse<br>
gear, the brake 134, the first clutch 126, and the second clutch 128 are engaged<br>
or activated. The brake 134 selectively couples the fourth planet carrier member<br>
120C to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 140 in order to<br>
restrict rotation of the fourth planet carrier member 120C relative to the<br>
transmission housing 140. The first clutch 126 selectively couples the input shaft<br>
112 and the fourth sun gear member 120A to the second planet carrier member<br>
116A. The second clutch 128 selectively couples the third planet carrier member<br>
118B to the fourth ring gear member 120B. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in FIG.<br>

[0055] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed automatic transmission 100 assumes, first of<br>
all, that all clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state<br>
21<br><br>

are inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear member shifts,<br>
i.e., changes of gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or<br>
brake engaged or activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0056] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
