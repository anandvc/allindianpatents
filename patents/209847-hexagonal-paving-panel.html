BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fairly often occurs a need to cover, temporarily or permanently, a ground with flooring, either to protect it or to provide a hard walk-or carriageway, for cultural events, on fairgrounds or construction sets. Building projects require temporary access roads and walkways. Elements used for such flooring purposes are most often made of plastics. User requirements include simple construction, low weight, simple and fast application and removal, easy transportation and storage combined with low production costs. Good adhesion to the base, high stability and mechanical properties are expected. In the state of the art, several concepts of surfacing elements for temporary walkways, roads and yards are known.<br>
European    patent      EP 0 621373      describes      a        ground       covering,      intended       as       a<br><br><br><br>
walk-on traffic surface area. The ground covering comprises coupled together hexagonal panels being provided on their sides with alternate hook protrusions and eyelet protrusions, interlocking after assembly. Mating surfaces of the connecting protrusions are rounded towards each other, allowing pivoting 5 movement of the protrusions. Between adjacent sides of connected panels is a certain clearance. Each panel is designed as a thick-wall membrane with an anti-slip pattern on the upper surface. Such panels, however, cannot be applied on uneven, angled or muddy base, for example construction sites, since uneven loads may cause disconnecting of the joints and destruction of the floor.<br>
10  French patent FR 2559177 describes standard hexagonal plate having edge hooks and eye-loops connection, for interlocking with others in a ground covering, such as emergency roadway. Underside of the plate comprises channels, which form diverging reinforcing ribs running out from the central point of the plate. Adjacent reinforcing ribs are connected together by a crack-preventive rib. The<br>
15     plate is made of aluminium-silicon alloy.<br>
German patent DE 196 40 128 describes a floor lining comprising a rectangular plate with four sides of reduced thickness. The four sides are formed so as to be connected with neighbouring plates by a groove and tongue connection. Two opposite sides of the pinto comprising the groove and tongue <br>
20  respectively, are provided with blind opening:; which form, together wild Listening plugs, fixing elements, preventing lateral displacement of the plates. The floor lining is made of plastic material.<br><german utility model de describes a hexagonal paving panel being provided on their sides with alternate hook protrusions interlocking after></german>
25 assembly. The panel comprises blind openings and pins with anti-slip heads being placed in the openings. Underside of the panel comprises reinforcing ribs.<br>
Although described above panels are well adopted to certain applications, like industrial or emergency purposes, they can not be applied on uneven, angled or muddy base. Some of these constructions may cause difficulties during mounting<br>
30 and de-mounting or have insufficient mechanical properties or can be expensive in production.<br>
German patent DE 41 43 419 relates to plastic hexagonal trays to form a patterned grass surface. Each tray has T shaped hooks and cutout:-.interlocking<br><br><br>
with adjacent plates as well as a  large central opening.  Between connected elements are provided gaps to drain off surface water.<br>
Canadian patent CA 2 091 036 concerns triangular, rectangular and hexagonal surface elements, consisting of cores filled with wood chips, saw dust, foam or 5 other loose material, enclosed in outer cover of thermoplastic or thermoset material. In particular the cover may be formed of glass-reinforced synthetic resin. The surface elements are designed for application on sands and feature downwardly extending flanges on their peripheries.<br>
A  modular  roff-out  portable  floor  and  walkway  comprising  a   plurality of<br>
10 interconnected covering panels of a lightweight plastic is known from US 5 833 386 and US 5 527 128 patents. Each panel is rectangular and comprises two downwardly extending connecting elements and two upwardly extending connecting elements. The panels comprise water drainage channels or drain holes. Downwardly extending connecting elements of each panel have oblong<br>
15 grooves to serve as hinges permitting rolling interconnected panels up. Upper surfaces are provided with an anti-slip pattern.<br>
Japanese patent JP 9296408 describes a rectangular synthetic resin surface panel intended particularly to be applied on a soft or muddy base. Longer sides of each panel have downwardly and upwardly extending connecting  hooks, while<br>
20 shorter sides have flat protrusions and corresponding flat cut outs, respectively. Longer sides of each panel are also provided with vertical protuberances and corresponding recesses, respectively. Each panel has drain holes.<br>
European patent EP 0 224 095 concerns a grid plate of plastic material to be applied   in    particular   on   grass   covered   ground   in   packing   lots    and   on<br>
25 embankments. Each plate features on at least one side, close to its upper surface, upwardly extending small hooks mating with downwardly extending small hooks arranged on the other side. Each plate has a large centra! opening to pass growing grass through.<br>
Concrete  hexagonal  elements for roads  surfaces  are  known  from  Polish<br>
30      patents PL 52 531 and PL 113473.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide a hexagonal paving panel which would feature simple design and be inexpensive in production, easy to store and transport, pose and remove. On the other hand, it should provide good adhesion<br><br><br>
to various bases, sufficiently high mechanical properties and wide application scope, ranging from pedestrian walkways to motor transport surfaces.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 3 there is shown a hexagonal paving panel 10 according  to  the  invention,  which   is  provided  with  a  hook-type  connecting<br>
15 arrangement. The panel 10 has in a plan view a shape ol a royular hexagon and is formed as a one-piece plastics moulding, particularly from waste or recycled material. The paving panel 10 has on its periphery a downwardly extending peripheral collar 11. The panel 10 has on its sides alternately extending upper and lower tab elements 12 and 13. The length I of the tab elements 12 and 13 is<br>
20     between 50 % and 80 %, preferably between 60% and 70% of the side length d of<br>
the panel, providing a secure and stable connection between the panels 10. The<br>
panel 10 has a central aperture 14 enclosed by a downwardly tapering sidewall 17<br>
(Fig.2). The sidewall 17 is provided on its outer surface with an annular protrusion<br>
. 18. The height of the sidewall 17 is greater than the thickness of the panel 10 and<br>
25 the height of the peripheral collar 11, while the height of the annular protrusion 18 preferably equals or slightly exceeds the height of the collar 11. The central aperture 14 performs three functions: serves as a drain hole, stabilises the panel 10 on the ground and improves storage of the panels 10, laid one on another in a stack. In the last case, the lower part 19 of the sidewall 17 of the upper pane! 10<br>
30 enters into upper part of the central aperture 14 of tie lower panel 10, while the annular protrusion 18 of the upper panel 10 rests en the top surface 15 of the lower panel 10.<br><br>
Paving panel 10 may be also provided with additional, preferably smaller drain holes, cylindrical or tapered, not shown in the drawings. Instead of or in addition to the single central aperture 14 the panel 10 may be provided with two, three or more similar apertures 14, arranged symmetrically around the centre of the panel<br>
5        10.<br>
The top, surface 15 of the panel 10 (Fig.lA) has a rough anti-slip pattern, while the bottom surface 16 is provided with conical or prismatic recesses 20 with large obtuse angle a, creating in a section a line, weavy or in the shape of a honeycomb. The recesses 20 increase the load-bearing surface and reduce the<br>
10   weight of the panel 10, ensuring its proper stability on the ground, even steep, loose or muddy.<br>
Each upper tab element 12 (Fig.3) extends beyond the collar 11 and has downwardly extending upper vertical arm 21, the upper surface of which is flush with the top surface 15 of the panel 10. The upper vertical arm 21 is rectangular in<br>
15 a cross-section, preferably with rounded lower corners. Between the upper vertical arm 21 and the collar 11 an upper cavity 22 is formed, open at the bottom and having a rectangular cross-section. The lower tab element 13 has upwardly extending lower vertical arm 23, the bottom surface of which is flush with the bottom surface of the collar 11. The lower vertical arm 23 is rectangular in a cross-<br>
20 section, preferably with rounded upper corners. Between the lower vertical arm 23 and the panel's side a lower cavity 24 is formed, open at the top and having a rectangular cross-section.<br>
Paving panels 10 are connected during the layout on the ground in such a way that the upper vertical arm 21 of the upper tab element 12 of one panel enters into<br>
25 the lower vertical cavity 24 of the lower tab element 13 of adjacent panel and at the same time the lower vertical arm 23 of the lower tab element 13 enters into the upper cavity 22 of the upper lab element 12 (Fig.3).<br>
Dimensions of the tab elements 12 and 13 are chosen so that the leading surfaces of the vertical arms 21 and 23 contact "the bottom surfaces of the cavities<br>
30 24 and 22, while the width of the cavities 22 and 24 of the tab elements 12 and 13 should be preferably the same and wider than the same width of the vertical arms 21  and 23 by approximately 2 mm to 8 mm, preferably 4 mm. Due to such<br><br>
dimensions between the connected panels 10 remains a certain play, enabling slight mutual movement ol the panels under a load.<br>
Length of the side ol the panel 10 shown as an example in the diawtny i:. /!/.'&gt; cm or 31 cm. In the first case, the area of the panel 10 equals 0.1994 m2 and in 5 the second case 0.249 m2. To cover 1 m2 of the ground, taking into accounts gaps between the panels, five smaller or four larger panels 10 are needed. Preferred dimensions of individual elements of the panel 10 are as follows (Fig.2): height h.1 of the collar 11 - 2.5 cm; smaller thickness h2 of the panel - 1 cm; greater thickness h3 of the panel - 1.5 cm; width w1 of the collar 11 - 1.15 cm; width w2<br>
10 of the conical or prismatic recess 20 - 7.53 cm and its obtuse angle a - 165.6°; maximum diameter w3 of the central aperture 14 - 4.8 cm and its minimum diameter w4 - 3 cm; outer diameter w5 of the sidewall 17 in its lowest part - 5 cm; and outer diameter w6 of the sidewall 17 in the area of connection with annular protrusion 19 - 7.52 cm.<br>
15	Examples of preferred dimensions of the upper and lower tab elements 12 and<br>
13 are as follows (Figs.lB and 3): width w of the tab elements - 2.4 cm; thickness w8 of the vertical arms 21 and 23 - 1 cm; width w9 of cavities 22, 24-1.4 cm; height h4 of the upper vertical arm 21-1.5 cm; while the height h5 of the lower<br>
,       vertical arm 23-1.7 cm.<br>
20	The above dimensions may, of course, be changed, depending on the type of<br>
plastics from which the panels 10 are produced, load and type of ground to be laid upon.<br>
Figs.4 and 5 show another embodiment of the invention. A hexagonal paving panel 30 is formed as a one-piece plastics moulding, particularly from waste or<br>
25 recycled material. The panel 30 differs from the panel 10 in being provided with, instead of hook-type connecting arrangement, an overlap-type connecting arrangement and fixing pins. All the remaining construction features of the two paving panels 10 and 30 are the same. The panel 30 has three identical upper overlap elements 31 extending beyond the collar 11', and three identical lower<br>
30 overlap elements 32 formed by reducing the thickness of the collar of the panel 30. Reverse arrangement, where lower overlap elements 32 extend beyond the collar 11' and upper overlap elements 31 are formed by reducing the pane! thickness is also possible. The upper surface of the upper overlap element 31 is flush with the<br><br>
lop surface 15' of the panel 30 and the lower surface of the lower overlap element<br>
32	lies in the plane of the bottom surface of  the colla 11'.<br>
Both overlap elements 31 and 32 are substantially rectangular in a cross, section. The upper overlap element 31 has two upper fixing holes 33 countersunk 5 in the upper part, and the lower overlap element 32 has two lower fixing holes 33', which after positioning the panels on the ground are aligned with the upper fixing holes 33 of the adjacent panel. The number of fixing holes 33 and 33' on each overlap element 31, 32 may be between one and four depending on the ground and the load.<br>
IO	During  laying paving panels 30 on the ground (Fig.5) the upper overlap<br>
element 31 of one panel overlies on the lower overlap element 32 of the adjacent panel, and after alignment of their fixing holes 33 and 33', between the side surface of the upper overlap element 31 of one panel and the side surface of the second, panel, as well as between the side surface of the lower overlap element 32<br>
15     of the second panel and side surface of the first panel's collar 11' gaps are formed in the width of 1 mm to 4 mm, preferably 2 mm. Through the aligned fixing holes<br>
33	and 33' of the overlap elements 31 and 32 of two adjacent panels 30 extend<br>
fixing bolts or pins (described further below), preferably made of plastics, wherein<br>
the head of each fixing pin enters into the countersunk part of the upper fixing hole<br>
20     33 and its tip may enter into the ground. Fixing pins secure the panels against slipping.<br>
In the example of the panel 30 having side length d' = 27.5 cm, the thickness h6 of the upper overlap element 31 equals 1 cm; the thickness h7 of the lower overlap element 32-1.5 cm; the width w10 of both overlap elements 31 and 32 -25 2.4 cm; diameter w11 of the countersunk part of the upper fixing hole 33 - 1.2 cm; while the diameter w12 of the remaining part of the upper fixing hole 33 and that of the lower fixing hole 33' - 0.8 cm. Remaining dimensions of this panel 30 are the same as those of the panel 10 according to Figs.1 to 3.<br>
The hexagonal paving panels 10 and  30 according to the invention,  as 30     described above, are produced entirely of plastics, originated mostly in recycling. Figs.6 to 9 present next two embodiments of the invention being heavy-duty hexagonal  paving  panels,  intended  primarily to cover the ground for heavy equipment, like for example contractor machines.<br><br>
The shape of the connecting elements and dimensions of the panels are the same as those of panels 30 according to Figs.4 and 5, but the later have a skeleton construction.<br>
The skeleton 40 of the paving panel 50, presented in Fig.6, consist: or a 5 plastic hexagonal frame 41 provided with all the elements of the connecting arrangement of the panel 30. The frame 41 features radial bracing ribs 42. connecting a sidewall 17" of a central aperture 14" with panel comers, and a reinforcement 43, comprising a few coaxial coils of steel wire of 1 to 6 mm diameter, preferably 4 mm, which extend through holes in the radial bracing'ribs lo   42. The skeleton 40 of the panel 50 performs at the same time a function of a form for rubber filling 44 (Fig.7), constituting together with the filling 44 the heavy-duty paving panel 50.<br>
Fig.8 presents further embodiment of a skeleton construction 60, which is<br>
provided with a hexagonal frame 61, produced of sheet metal, preferably steel.<br>
15     The frame 61 has a central part 62 with a central aperture 63, a hexagonal rim 64<br>
with a perimeter slightly smaller than that of a paving panel 70, and provided with<br>
holes 65 and 65' in those locations where fixing holes of overlap elements of the<br>
panel 70 are formed, and radial bracing ribs 66, connecting the central part 62 with<br>
corners of the hexagonal rim 64. The skeleton 60 features also a reinforcement<br>
20     43', similarly like in the case of skeleton construction 40 according to Figs.6 and 7.<br>
The skeleton 60 is placed in a form (not shown), in which it is covered on both<br>
sides in a casting of rubber filling 67 (Fig.9), resulting in a strengthened rubber<br>
paving panel 70. Due to the fact that the panel 70 has no plastic components the<br>
use of high temperature rubber casting mass as well as pressing of the mass<br>
25     during the casting is possible.<br>
The rubber fillings 44 and 67 used in the two embodiments of heavy-duty paving panels 50 and 70 consists of rubber granulate, obtained preferably by grinding of worn automobile tyres and of hardening adhesive mixed with the granulate. Before casting, the rubber fillings 44 and 67 are heated up to the 30 temperature of softening and after casting they are cooled down. The rubber paving panels 50 and 70 are relatively hard and resistant to abrasion.<br>
Further embodiment of the invention is a hexagonal paving panel 100 comprising an overlap-type connecting arrangement with fixing pins. The panel<br><br>
100 is provided with downwardly extending wide peripheral collar 101, and with integral upper and lower overlap elements 102 and 103 formed alternately on its sites. The upper overlap elements 102 are formed by decreasing the thickness of the collar 101, and the lower overlap elements 103 extend beyond the hexagonal 5 outline of the panel 100. Reverse arrangement of the overlap elements 102 and 103 is also possible.<br>
The upper surface of the upper overlap element 102 is flush with the top<br>
. surface 104 of the panel 100, while the bottom surface of the lower overlap<br>
element 103 lies in the plane of lower surface of the collar 101. Construction of Iho<br>
IO overlap connecting elements of the panel 100 differs from the panels 10 and 30 in this way that the upper overlap elements 102 are provided with additional upper connecting holes 105, preferably oval, while in the lower overlap elements 103 are provided with correspondingly shaped upright connecting protrusions 106, which enter into the connecting holes 105 of the upper overlap element 102 of the<br>
15 adjacent panel 100. Due to this the number of fixing holes 107 and 108 and fixing pins in the overlap connecting elements has been reduced.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention two connecting holes 105 and thus two connecting protrusions 106 are formed and between the two connecting holes 105 and connecting protrusions 106 one fixing hole 107 and 108 for the<br>
20 fixing pin is formed. Construction of the fixing holes 107 and of the fixing pins will be described in detail further below. Such modification of the overlap connecting elements permits the road surface made of the panels 100to cany considerbly higher loads.<br>
Also the construction of the central aperture 110 is accordingly modified<br>
25 (Fig.11). The central aperture 110 has in the top a shallow planar recess 110 and in the bottom a narrower friistoconical recess 111, the two being connected by a narrow channel 112. Thickness of the sidewall 113 of the central apertuie 109 is considerably bigger, as a result the protruding ring became eliminated. The sidewall 113 extends beyond the bottom surface of the collar 101 of the panel 100.<br>
30 Outer diameter of the sidewall 113 is approximately the same as that of the planar recess 110 of the central aperture 109. Such shape of central aperture 109 permits the storage of the panels 100 in a stack without a risk of lateral displacement.<br><br>
On the surface of the planar recess 110 may be located manufacturer's name<br>
or other markings. The panel 100 has a fragment of the surface, preferably on ihe<br>
upper overlap  element  102  intended  for applying  an  identification  number,<br>
. individual for each panel, to enable controlling the panels' distribution and to<br>
5     facilitate identification of stolen panels.	<br>
In this embodiment according to the invention, transitions between the sidewall<br>
113 of central aperture 109 and the bottom surface 114, and between. lluyKll<br>
101 and the bottom surface 114, are rounded.	<br>
The paving panel 100 is provided also with a well visible marker 115 for easier<br>
IO     dividing of the panel into two parts. The marker 115 may have any practical form,<br>
for example that of a shallow linear groove. The paving panel 100 (Tig. IOC) in;iy<br>
be provided on its bottom side with an inner arrangement of blind openings 131,<br>
formed on the sidewall 113 of the central aperture 109 and/or with an outer<br>
arrangement of blind openings 132, formed on these parts of the collar 101 from<br>
15     which the lower overlap elements 103 extend. Instead of the arrangement of large<br>
number of small blind openings 132 may be formed an arrangement of lesser<br>
number of larger blind openings 133 (Fig.10D). The blind openings 131, 132 and<br>
133, which may have any practical shape, are intended to reduce the weight of<br>
panel 100 and to accelerate its drying after the forming process.<br>
20	Figs.13A and 13B present upper and lower overlap elements 102 and 103 in<br>
section through upper and lower fixing holes for the fixing pin. Upper fixing hole<br>
107	is conically countersunk at top and bottom parts, while the lower fixing hole<br>
108	is cylindrical, with diameter slightly larger then that of the middle part of the upper fixing hole 107. For such shape of the fixing holes 107 and 108 a special<br>
25 fixing clip-pin 116 has been developed (Figs.14A and 15), the top surface of which is flush with the top surface 104 of the panel 100.<br>
The clip-pin 116 has a conical head 117 which fits into the countersink part of the fixing hole 107 of the upper overlap element 102 and four resilient legs 118 extending from the head 117 and ended with specially shaped tips 119, which<br>
30 after connecting the panels 100 engage with lower edge of the fixing hole 108. The number of resilient legs 118 may be from two to six, preferably four. The clip-pin 116 is provided near the head 117 with a circumferential groove 120 into which enters a flat tip of disassembly tool 121, specially constructed for this purpose<br><br><br>

extremely important for the environment protection,  since waste plastic the presence of which becomes a growing environmental problem, due to their long decomposition time and content of toxic substances, may be in this way utilised clip-pins 116 and 127 is in the combination of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), commonly present as waste. In order to select the test. composition of these components and possible modifying agents, several tests were conducted as to the strength and deformation of materials produced.(lorn various combinations of the components.<br>
To the strength tests were submitted samples of materials with varying content of PE, PP and chalk (K). The tests were conducted on an INSTRON machine at three temperatures: two extremes (-30°G and +60°C) and one room temperature (+20°C). The tests permitted determining of elongation, strength and Young's module (E) of the materials studied. Results obtained are presented in the table below. Percentage content of the modifying agent is related to a total mass of PP and PE(100% = PP + PE).<br><br>

From the tests it results that the materials containing PP, PE and PP+PE combination feature relatively high mechanical strength but also relatively small deformability (elongation). Modifying the plastics with chalk results in a decrease of strength, but also in a considerable increase of deformability, important with 5 large loads. Generally, a/I materials tested are suitable for the production of paving panels according to the invention and the panels manufactured may transmit high and even very high loads, originating from heavy vehicles, like delivery vans.<br>
Most suitable material for high loads, or when the ground is not uniform, or<br>
when extensive changes of temperature are expected is in the 1:1 proportion of<br>
10     PP and PE with 20 % addition of chalk. Instead of, chalk, other modifying agents<br>
may be used, particularly talc and glass fibres in proportion ranging from 5 % to 60<br>
% in relation to the total mass of PP and PE.<br>
Besides the preferred mechanical properties, the materials tested show high<br>
resistance to acids, bases, salts and organic solvents.<br>
