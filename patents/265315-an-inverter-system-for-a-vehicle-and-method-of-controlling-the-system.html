				<td>SERIES-COUPLED TWO-MOTOR DRIVE<br>
USING DOUBLE-ENDED INVERTER SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60,952,740, filed July 30, 2007.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to vehicle drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments of the<br>
subject matter relate to hybrid vehicles having a double-ended inverter drive<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004] Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors<br>
used in such vehicles, receive electrical power from alternating current (AC)<br>
power supplies. However, the power sources (e.g., batteries) used in such<br>
applications provide only direct current (DC) power. Thus, devices known as<br>
"power inverters" are used to convert the DC power to AC power, which often<br>
utilize several of switches, or transistors, operated at various intervals to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power.<br>
[0005] Additionally, such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, often<br>
use two separate voltage sources (e.g., a battery and a fuel cell) to power the<br><br>
electric motors that drive the wheels. "Power converters," such as direct<br>
current-to-direct current (DCDC) converters, are typically used to manage<br>
and transfer the power from the two voltage sources. Modern DC/DC<br>
converters often include transistors electrically interconnected by an inductor.<br>
By controlling the states of the various transistors, a desired average current<br>
can be impressed through the inductor and thus control the power flow<br>
between the two voltage sources.<br>
[0006] The utilization of both a power inverter and a power converter<br>
greatly increases the complexity of the electrical system of the automobile.<br>
The additional components required for both types of devices also increase the<br>
overall cost and weight of the vehicle. Accordingly, systems and methods<br>
have been developed for operating a motor coupled to multiple power sources<br>
without a DC/DC converter while maximizing the performance of the motor<br>
by utilizing dual inverter electrical systems.<br>
[0007] Traditional automotive systems include electrical systems designed<br>
for three-phase motors. However, multi-phase motor drives with more than<br>
three phases operate with improved efficiency and reduce the required inverter<br>
per-phase power rating. In some cases, this may result in cheaper and more<br>
compact power inverters in addition to improved motor performance.<br>
Additionally, multi-phase motor drives with at least five or more phases may<br>
be configured in series in an appropriate manner with another motor drive,<br>
thereby reducing the number of power inverters required in a system while<br>
providing independent control of both motors.<br>
[0008] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide systems and methods for<br>
operating a series-coupled two-motor drive using a dual inverter system<br>
coupled to two separate energy sources. Other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction<br>
with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and<br>
background<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0009] An apparatus is provided for an automotive drive system. The<br>
automotive drive system comprises a series-coupled two-motor drive<br>
comprising a first motor having a first set of windings and a second set of<br>
windings, and a second motor having a third set of windings, wherein the third<br>
set of windings is coupled to the first set of windings and the second set of<br>
windings. A first inverter is coupled to the first set of windings and a second<br>
inverter coupled to the second set of windings.<br>
[0010] An apparatus is provided for an inverter system for use in a vehicle<br>
having a first energy source and a second energy source. The inverter system<br>
comprises a six-phase motor having a first set of three-phase windings and a<br>
second set of three-phase windings and a three-phase motor having a third set<br>
of three-phase windings, wherein the third set of three-phase windings is<br>
coupled to the first set of three-phase windings and the second set of three-<br>
phase windings. A first inverter is coupled to the first energy source and is<br>
adapted to drive the six-phase motor and the three-phase motor, wherein the<br>
first set of three-phase windings is coupled to the first inverter. A second<br>
inverter is coupled to the second energy source and is adapted to drive the six-<br>
phase motor and the three-phase motor, wherein the second set of three-phase<br>
windings is coupled to the second inverter. A controller is coupled to the first<br>
inverter and the second inverter and may be configured to control the first<br>
inverter and the second inverter in order to achieve desired power flow<br>
between the first energy source, the second energy source, the six-phase<br>
motor, and the three-phase motor.<br>
[0011] A method is provided for controlling a six-phase motor and a three-<br>
phase motor coupled in series using a double-ended inverter system<br>
comprising a first inverter and a second inverter. In response to determining a<br>
first motor current corresponding to a commanded torque in the six-phase<br>
motor and a second motor current corresponding to a commanded torque in<br>
the three-phase motor, the method comprises determining a first current based<br>
on the first motor current for each phase of the six-phase motor being driven<br><br>
by the first inverter and the second motor current for each phase of the three-<br>
phase motor. The method further comprises determining a second current<br>
based on the first motor current for each phase of the six-phase motor being<br>
driven by the second inverter and the second motor current for each phase of<br>
the three-phase motor, and adjusting the voltage output of the double-ended<br>
inverter system to produce the first current in the first inverter and the second<br>
current in the second inverter.<br>

[0021] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle, or automobile 10, according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 10 includes a chassis<br>
12, a body 14, four wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body<br>
14 is arranged on the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other<br>
components of the automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly<br>
form a frame. The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12<br>
near a respective corner of the body 14.<br><br>
[0022] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br>
and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and<br>
an electric motor.<br>
[0023] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 further includes a first motor 20 (i.e., an electric motor/generator, traction<br>
motor, etc.), a first energy source 22, a second energy source 24, a power<br>
inverter assembly 26, and a radiator 28. The radiator 28 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze), and is coupled to the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 and the first motor 20. In one embodiment, the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 receives and shares coolant with the first motor 20. As<br>
shown in FIG. 1, the first motor 20 may also include a transmission integrated<br>
therein such that the first motor 20 and the transmission are mechanically<br>
coupled to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more drive shafts 30.<br>
[0024] As shown, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source<br>
24 are in operable communication and/or electrically coupled to the electronic<br>
control system 18 and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not<br>
illustrated, the first energy source 22 and the second energy source 24 may<br>
vary depending on the embodiment and may be of the same or different type.<br>
In one or more embodiments, the first energy source 22 and second energy<br>
source 24 may each comprise a battery, a fuel cell, an ultracapacitor, or<br>
another suitable voltage source. A battery may be any type of battery suitable<br>
for use in a desired application, such as a lead acid battery, a lithium-ion<br><br>
battery, a nickel-metal battery, or another rechargeable battery. An<br>
ultracapacitor may comprise a supercapacitor, an electrochemical double layer<br>
capacitor, or any other electrochemical capacitor with high energy density<br>
suitable for a desired application.<br>
[0025] The automobile 10 further includes a second motor 21 which is<br>
coupled to the first motor 20 in series by configuring the stator windings of the<br>
motors 20 and 21 in an appropriate manner. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
second motor 21 is a low power auxiliary motor having a power rating<br>
approximately 10% of the power rating of the first motor 20. Using a second<br>
motor 21 with a considerably smaller power rating than the first motor 20<br>
reduces stator winding losses in the first motor 20 which are a natural result of<br>
the series configuration. Although the second motor 21 may have a power<br>
rating ratio greater than 10%, the stator winding losses could increase to a<br>
point where the series-coupled motor drive becomes impractical.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a double-ended inverter system 32<br>
may be adapted to drive a series-coupled two-motor drive 23 within the<br>
automobile 10 in accordance with one embodiment. The double-ended<br>
inverter system 32 includes the first motor 20, the second motor 21, the first<br>
energy source 22, the second energy source 24, the power inverter assembly<br>
26, and a controller 34.<br>
[0027] In an exemplary embodiment, the first motor 20 is a multi-phase<br>
alternating current (AC) motor and includes a first set of windings 36 (or<br>
coils) and a second set of windings 37, wherein each winding corresponds to<br>
one phase of the first motor 20. Although not illustrated, the first motor 20<br>
includes a stator assembly (including the coils), a rotor assembly (including a<br>
ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), as will be appreciated<br>
by one skilled in the art. The first motor 20 may be an induction motor, a<br>
permanent magnet motor, or any type suitable for the desired application.<br>
[0028] In an exemplary embodiment, the first motor 20 is a six-phase<br>
motor, with the first set of windings 36 (phases A-C and the second set of<br>
windings 37 (phases D-F) each corresponding to three-phase wiring structures.<br><br>
The second motor 21 is a three-phase motor with a third set of windings 39<br>
corresponding to a three-phase wiring structure (phases a-c). The connection<br>
of the windings 36, 37 and 39 may vary depending on the desired application<br>
and can be extended out to accommodate additional phases in the motors 20<br>
and 21 as will be appreciated in the art.<br>
[0029] In an exemplary embodiment, the series-coupled two-motor drive<br>
23 is created by connecting phases A and D of the first motor 20 which are<br>
coupled to phase a of the second motor 21, connecting phases B and E of the<br>
first motor 20 which are coupled to phase b of the second motor 21, and<br>
connecting phases C and F of the first motor 20 which are coupled to phase c<br>
of the second motor 21. In accordance with one embodiment, the third set of<br>
windings 39 may be configured as a wye connection by connecting the ends of<br>
phases a, b, and c which are not coupled to the first motor 20 to create a<br>
neutral point 41. The connections of the windings 36 and 37 (phases A and D,<br>
B and E, C and F) may be connected internally in order to reduce the number<br>
of stator terminals on the first motor 20.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 3, the spatial arrangement of the windings<br>
36, 37, and 39 within the motors 20 and 21 may very depending on the design.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the first motor 20 and second motor 21 are both<br>
symmetrical. In an exemplary embodiment, where the first motor 20 is a six-<br>
phase symmetrical motor, the spatial displacement between any two<br>
consecutive stator phases is 60°. In this case, phases A and D are displaced by<br>
180°, such that when the motor 20 is coupled as in FIG. 2, the flux/torque<br>
producing current flowing through phase A (iA_M1) returns through phase D<br>
(iD_MI) and therefore will not flow to the second motor 21 (i.e., the currents<br>
cancel at the point of connection and do not flow to phase a). This also<br>
applies for the other phases (B and E, C and F) which are also displaced by<br>
180°. The result of this configuration is that the torque producing current in<br>
the first motor 20 does not flow through the second motor 21. The second<br>
motor 21 may be a symmetrical three-phase motor, such that the displacement<br>
between consecutive stator phases is 120° as is understood in the art.<br><br>
[0031] Referring again to FIG. 2, the power inverter assembly 26 includes<br>
a first inverter 38 and a second inverter 40, each including six switches (e.g.,<br>
semiconductor devices, such as transistors and/or switches) with antiparallel<br>
diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch). As shown, the switches in the<br>
inverters 38 and 40 are arranged into three legs (or pairs), with legs 42, 44, and<br>
46 being in the first inverter 38 and legs 48, 50, and 52 being in the second<br>
inverter 40.<br>
[0032] In an exemplary embodiment, the first phase (A) of the first set of<br>
windings 36 of the first motor 20 is electrically connected between the<br>
switches of switch leg 42 in the first inverter 38. The second phase (B) of the<br>
first set of windings 36 is connected between the switches of leg 44 in the first<br>
inverter 38 and the third phase (C) of the first set of windings 36 is connected<br>
between the switches of leg 46. Similarly, the phases (D, E, and F) of the<br>
second set of windings 37 may be connected between the switches of legs 48,<br>
50, and 52 as shown.<br>
[0033] In this configuration, energy sources 22 and 24 with different<br>
voltage levels, power ratings, operating characteristics, etc. may be used<br>
simultaneously. This is particularly advantageous compared to other inverter<br>
systems where, as a practical matter, the energy sources 22 and 24 are required<br>
to be nearly identical. For example, in this case, a high voltage source (&gt;<br>
100V) may be used simultaneously with a 12 V battery to drive the series-<br>
coupled two-motor drive 23. However, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
energy sources 22 and 24 have similar voltage levels in order to achieve<br>
optimal control of the current in the system. The series-coupled two-motor<br>
drive 23 eliminates the need for a third inverter to drive the second motor 21.<br>
[0034] Still referring to FIG. 2, the double-ended inverter system 32 may<br>
also include first and second capacitors 54 and 56 respectively connected in<br>
parallel with the first and second energy sources 22 and 24 to smooth current<br>
ripple during operation. The controller 34 is in operable communication<br>
and/or electrically coupled to the first and second inverters 38 and 40. The<br>
controller 34 is responsive to commands received from the driver of the<br><br>
automobile 10 (i.e. via an accelerator pedal) and provides commands to the<br>
first inverter 38 and the second inverter 40, as will be described, to control the<br>
output of the inverters 38 and 40.<br>
[0035] Referring again to FIG. 1, the electronic control system 18 is in<br>
operable communication with the first motor 20, the second motor 21, the first<br>
energy source 22, the second energy source 24, and the power inverter<br>
assembly 26. Although not shown in detail, the electronic control system 18<br>
may include various sensors and automotive control modules, or electronic<br>
control units (ECUs), such as an inverter control module (i.e., the controller 34<br>
shown in FIG. 2) and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor and/or a<br>
memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-<br>
readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as described<br>
below.<br>
[0036] In an exemplary embodiment, during operation, the automobile 10<br>
is operated by providing power to the wheels 16 with the first motor 20 which<br>
receives power from the first energy source 22 and the second energy source<br>
24 in an alternating manner and/or with the first energy source 22 and the<br>
second energy source 24 simultaneously. In order to power the first motor 20,<br>
DC power is provided from the first energy source 22 and the second energy<br>
source 24 to the first and second inverters 38 and 40 respectively, which<br>
convert the DC power into AC power, as is commonly understood in the art.<br>
The first and second inverters 38 and 40 produce AC voltages across the<br>
windings 36 and 37 (or phases). As is commonly understood, the required<br>
voltages across the windings 36 and 37 of the first motor 20 (FIG. 2) are<br>
dependent on the speed, commanded torque (i.e., commanded synchronous<br>
frame currents), and other motor parameters.<br>
[0037] In an exemplary embodiment, the second motor 21 operates<br>
independently of the first motor 20 as an auxiliary low-power motor. The<br>
energy sources 22 and 24 and inverters 38 and 40 also power the second motor<br>
21 based upon the speed, commanded torque (i.e., commanded synchronous<br>
frame currents), and other motor parameters as described below.<br><br>
[0038] FIG. 4 illustrates a control system 60 for operating a series-coupled<br>
two-motor drive 23 using a double-ended inverter system 32 in accordance<br>
with one embodiment. High frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) may<br>
be employed by the controller 34 to modulate and control the inverters 38 and<br>
40 and manage the voltage produced by the inverters 38 and 40. The control<br>
system 60 includes first and second PWM blocks 68 and 70, and the double-<br>
ended inverter system 32. The controller 34 provides a control algorithm that<br>
achieves desired power flow between the first and second energy sources 22<br>
and 24 while producing the commanded torque inside the motors 20 and 21.<br>
Although not shown, the control system 60 receives a torque command for the<br>
first motor 20 from which the controller 34 may determine power commands<br>
for the first energy source 22 (and/or the first inverter 38) and the second<br>
energy source 24 (and/or the second inverter 40), as well as currents for the<br>
windings 36 and 37 within the first motor 20.<br>
[0039] Referring now to FIG. 5, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
controller 34 may be configured to operate the series-coupled two-motor drive<br>
23. The controller 34 determines the current required for each phase of the<br>
first motor 20 in order to produce the commanded torque in response to a<br>
torque command 500. The controller 34 also determines the current required<br>
for each phase of the second motor 21 in order to produce the commanded<br>
torque in response to a torque command for the second motor 21 502. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the respective torque commands may be<br>
provided to the controller 34 by the electronic control system 18.<br>
[0040] Based the respective torque commands for the motors 20 and 21,<br>
the controller 34 may determine the required currents for the inverter legs 42,<br>
44, 46, 48, 50 and 52. The current required for the first inverter 38 is<br>
determined based on the current required for each phase of the first motor 20<br>
being driven by the first inverter 38 and the current required for each phase of<br>
the second motor 21 504. Similarly, the current required for the second<br>
inverter 40 may be determined based on the current required for each phase of<br><br>
the first motor 20 being driven by the second inverter 40 and the current<br>
required for each phase of the second motor 21 506.<br>
[0041] Referring to FIGS. 2 and 5, using the configuration of the windings<br>
36, 37 and 39 shown can enable independent and decoupled control of the first<br>
motor 20 and second motor 21 using vector control and rotor-flux-oriented<br>
control principles understood in the art. In an exemplary case, where the first<br>
motor 20 comprises six phases and the second motor 21 comprises three<br>
phases, each inverter 38 and 40 phase leg 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52 current<br>
consists of the sum of current through the first motor 20 phase coupled to the<br>
respective leg 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52 and a factor of the corresponding<br>
current through the second motor 21 phase coupled to the first motor 20 phase.<br>
In general, this may be determined using the following equations:<br><br>
where iINVIN or iINV2N is the current required in a referenced inverter phase leg<br>
42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52, iX_MI is the current required in the phase in the first<br>
motor 20 coupled to the referenced inverter phase leg 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and<br>
52, iy_M2 is the current required in the phase in the second motor 21 coupled to<br>
the referenced phase in the first motor 20, and a is a constant based on the<br>
number and configuration of phases in the respective motors 20 and 21 for a<br>
given embodiment.<br>
[0042] In an exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 2, where the first<br>
motor 20 is a symmetrical six-phase motor and the second motor 21 is a<br>
symmetrical three-phase motor, a is equal to 0.5. The currents for the<br>
inverters 38 and 40 can then be determined based on the currents required for<br>
the first motor 20 and second motor 21 using the following set of equations:<br><br>
[0043] In accordance with one embodiment, the controller 34 may adjust<br>
the voltage output of the double-ended inverter system 32 to produce the<br><br>
required current in the first inverter 38 and the second inverter 40 508.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the controller 34 may provide the first and second PWM<br>
blocks 68 and 70 with modulating voltage signals v1* and v2* to generate PWM<br>
signals to operate the switches within the first and second inverters 38 and 40<br>
to cause the desired output voltages to be applied across the windings 36 and<br>
37 within the first motor 20, shown in FIG. 2, to operate the first motor 20 and<br>
the second motor 21 with the required torque.<br>
[0044] As discussed above, the torque producing currents of the first<br>
motor 20 will cancel at the point of the connection and do not flow to the<br>
second motor 21. In an exemplary embodiment, the current provided to the<br>
second motor 21 is in 180° spatial displacement within the first motor 20 such<br>
that the net magnetomotive force created by this current within the first motor<br>
20 is zero or negligible. In sum, the torque producing current for the second<br>
motor 21 does not produce flux or torque in the first motor 20, and the current<br>
producing torque in the first motor 20 sums to zero at the connection of the<br>
phases. Accordingly, control of the motors 20 and 21 may be decoupled using<br>
independent vector control or other control methods understood in the art.<br>
[0045] One advantage of the system and/or method described above is that<br>
the electrical system used to power the first motor 20 with separate energy<br>
sources 22 and 24 is greatly simplified, as a conventional DC/DC power<br>
converter is not required. Furthermore, the system eliminates the need to for<br>
an additional inverter and/or separate control hardware/software to operate the<br>
second motor 21. Although there is an increase in stator power losses in the<br>
first motor 20, the double-ended inverter system 32 still results in improved<br>
operating efficiency when compared to using an additional inverter to drive<br>
the second motor 21, provided that the ratio of the power rating of the second<br>
motor 21 to the first motor 20 is low. As described above, the performance of<br>
the first motor 20 is not impaired as the commanded torque may still be<br>
controlled and generated within the first motor 20.<br>
[0046] Other embodiments may utilize system and method described<br>
above in different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and<br><br>
aircraft), or in different electrical systems altogether, as it may be<br>
implemented in any situation where the voltages of the two sources<br>
dynamically change over a wide range. The first motor 20, the second motor<br>
21, and the inverters 38 and 40 may have different numbers of phases, and the<br>
systems described herein should not be construed as limited to a six-phase and<br>
three-phase design. Other forms of energy sources 22 and 24 may be used,<br>
such as current sources and loads including diode rectifiers, thyristor<br>
converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors, and/or any combination thereof.<br>
[0047] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to signal<br>
processing, data transmission, signaling, network control, and other functional<br>
aspects of the systems (and the individual operating components of the<br>
systems) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting<br>
lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent<br>
exemplary functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the<br>
various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional<br>
functional relationships or physical connections may be present in an<br>
embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0048] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
