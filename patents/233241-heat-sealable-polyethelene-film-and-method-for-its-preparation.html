				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of heat scalable film and to the heat sealable film per se.      In particular, the invention relates to the use of a particular polyolefin composition in the manufacture of the sealing layer in such heat sealable films.<br>
Heat sealable films are used in industry for a wide variety of applications such as food and medical packaging.  The use of a variety of polyolefins to produce films with good optical properties, high impact strength and good processability is well-known in the art.  Polymers or blends of polymers used to make the films are selected for use because they provide excellent transparency, excellent processability and/or a strong seal between the film and article to be sealed. Such seals are preferably rapidly and readily formed by a single short application of heat and/or pressure.<br>
The entire heat sealed film may be constructed from the same polymer or a blend of polymers.  More often, the films are constructed using layers of different materials and polymers.  This type of construction is employed to ensure that multilayer films have desirable physical and mechanical properties such as clarity, strength, and resistance to puncture and tearing, in addition to heat sealing properties.  Such multilayer films should be easily processed by high speed equipment.<br>
Many plastic materials are known to possess good physical and mechanical properties but often do not also possess good heat sealing properties.  For example, polypropylene has good strength and clarity and is resistant to tearing, but does not readily form good seals at the temperatures which are preferred in<br><br>
commercial sealing machinery.  Conversely, some polymers with good heat sealing properties do not have adequate strength or clarity.<br>
The packaging art has therefore developed multiple layer films incorporating one or more layers of the same or different types of polymers that provide good mechanical and physical properties and providing one or more additional layers formed from polymers that provide the film with good heat sealing properties.  In this way, a film may be produced having a substrate layer of polypropylene -provided for strength and clarity and a layer of polyethylene to provide good heat sealing properties.<br>
Various types of polyethylene polymers are known in the art as having acceptable heat sealing properties, e.g. low density polyethylene (LDPE) , linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), ultra linear low density polyethylene (ULLDPE) , metallocene based LLDPE (mLLDPE) , ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) ,   ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA), ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) .  These polymers often form part of the sealing layer often as blends with other polymers within this group.  In most cases, the seal which is formed between the film and article to be sealed is put under load while it is still warm.  This means that the hot-tack properties of the sealing layer are crucial to ensure a strong seal is formed even before cooling.<br>
EP-A-605952 discloses a polymer composition comprising two different ethylene copolymers obtained using dualsite metallocene catalysts.  These two polymers are combined by, for example, blending to form a composition suitable in the preparation of films. However, the examples indicate that ethylene copolymer components produced using a single site catalyst give rise tc films with inferior optical and mechanical properties as well as poor processability.<br>
WC 93/03 093 discloses films comprising two layers,<br><br>
one of which may be formed by a blend of ethylene interpclymers.  The ethylene interpolymers of use in the films are ill-defined but these should in general have narrow molecular weight distributions or comonomer distributions.<br>
All heat sealable films have a window within which sealing may occur, i.e. in which the sealing layer becomes partially molten.  Traditionally, this sealing window has been rather narrow meaning that temperature control during the heat sealing process is critical.  It would be advantageous if sealing layers with broader sealing windows could be developed since this would allow the sealing operation to take place at lower temperature and also ensure that temperature control during heat sealing is less important.<br>
By operating at lower temperature there are the benefits that the article to be sealed is not exposed to high temperature and the other layers of the film which may not be involved in sealing are also not exposed to high temperature.  There are also economic advantages since lower temperatures are of course cheaper to generate and maintain.<br>
Whilst the above polyethylene polymers give rise to high strength seals, the sealing windows of these polymers are very narrow.  There still remains a desire to produce films with broader and lower sealing windows and high sealing strength.<br>
There also remains a need to produce such films with high hot-tack values and preferably these films can be prepared by coextrusion as opposed to lamination or the like since coextrusion is a much more efficient method of film production.<br>
It has now been found that by preparing a film comprising a core layer and a sealing layer, wherein the sealing layer comprises a particular bimodal ethylene copolymer composition, films with especially broad heat sealing windows may be prepared.  These films have<br><br>
applications in many areas of industry, particularly in medical and food packaging.<br>
Thus, viewed from one aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a heat sealable film comprising a core layer and a sealing layer, said process comprising attaching said core layer to said sealing layer, said sealing layer comprising an ethylene copolymer composition in which<br>
(1)	there are two distinct maxima in the TREF fractogram of the ethylene copolymer composition,-<br>
(2)	at least 10%, preferably at least 15%, in particular at least 2 0% of the ethylene copolymer composition elutes in TREF at a temperature of less than 50°C;<br>
(3)	at least 25%, preferably at least 3 0% of the ethylene copolymer composition elutes in TREF at a temperature of higher than 75 °C;<br>
(4)	none of the ethylene copolymer composition elutes in TREF at a temperature of higher than 100°C;<br>
(5)	the ethylene copolymer composition comprises two components, one of which is of relatively high comonomer content and high molecular weight, the other of which is of relatively low comonomer content and low molecular weight, both components being prepared by polymerisation of ethylene with a C3-2o alpha-olefin in the present of a single site catalyst;<br>
(6)	the ethylene copolymer composition has a density of between 905 and 93 0 kg/m3, preferably between 9 05 and 92 0 kg/m3 and an MFR2 between 0.3 and 4.0 g/10<br>
min.<br><br>
Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a heat sealable film obtainable by a process as hereinbefore described.<br>
Viewed from yet another aspect the invention provides the use of a film obtainable by a process as hereinbefore described in packaging.<br>
The film of the invention may comprise additional layers ever and above the sealing layer and core layer. In this case, the additional layers must be positioned on the opposite side of the core layer from the sealing layer thus ensuring that the sealing layer remains outermost on the film.<br>
The sealing layer comprises a mixture of two ethylene copolymers, one having a relatively low molecular weight and content of comonomer and one having-a relatively high molecular weight and content of comonomer.  Thus, the ethylene copolymer composition of use in the sealing layer is bimodal both in terms of density and molecular weight.  The differences in comonomer distribution between the high and low molecular weight components must be such that two maxima are observed on the TREF fractogram of the ethylene copolymer composition.<br>
TREF fractograms are obtained by the method described in the Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Physics edition, Vol 20, 441-455 (1982) Wild et al.      The method is based on the different solubilities of the polymer fractions having different comonomer contents in a specific solvent at different temperatures.  In the present invention, TREF fractograms are taken using xylene for crystallisation and 1, 2 , 4-trichlorobenzene as the sclvent.  The presence of two maxima in the TREF fractogram indicates broad comonomer distribution.<br>
Khilst it is possible to blend the ethylene copolymer composition of the sealing layer with other<br>
polymers such as linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene or polar ethylene copolymers such<br><br>
as EVA this is not a preferred embodiment.<br>
In the ethylene copolymer composition of the sealing layer, there should be no elution in the TREF fractogram above 10 0°C.  This ensures that the ethylene copolymer composition is free from high density polymer fractions ensuring excellent homogeneity and optical properties.<br>
The fact that at least 10% of the ethylene copolymer composition elutes at less than 50 °C and at least 25% of the ethylene copolymer composition elutes at more than 7.5 °C ensures that the ethylene copolymer composition comprises a broad comonomer distribution.<br>
The low molecular weight component (B) preferably has a weight average molecular weight of 5,000 to 50,000 g/mol, preferably 10,000 to 30,000 g/mol.  The MFR2 of the low molecular weight component (B) is preferably 5 0 to 1,00C g/10 min, more preferably 50 to 300 g/10 min and especially 75 to 200 g/10 min.  The density of this low molecular weight component is preferably 925 to 945 kg/m3, more preferably 925 to 94 0 kg/m3, and especially 927 to 937 kg/m3.  The Mn/Mw of the low molecular weight component is typically between 2.0 and 4.0, preferably between 2.5 and 4.0.<br>
Component (B) is a copolymer of ethylene and at least one C3_20 alpha olefin comonomer.  Suitable comonomers include propene, 1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octene.  Preferably, there is only one comonomer present in the low molecular weight component.<br>
The content of comonomer in the component (B) is preferably 1.0 to 3.5 %/mol, preferably 1.5 to 3.5 %/mol.  Whilst the overall comonomer distribution of the ethylene copolymer composition is broad, it is possible for the comonomer distributions of the low and high molecular weight components to be relatively narrow as long as these components have different average comonomer contents.<br>
The high molecular weight component (C) may have a<br><br>
weight average molecular weight of 50,000 to 500,000 g/rnoi, preferably 100,000 to 300,000 g/mol and a density of 860 to 910 kg/m3, preferably 890 to 910 kg/m3. The Mn/Mw of the high molecular weight component is typically between 2.5 and 5.0, preferably 3.0 to 4.5.<br>
Comonomers employed in the manufacture of component (C) are identical to those in the manufacture of component (B) although the content of comonomer in component (C) should be higher.  The comonomer content in the component (C) is preferably 5 to 8%/mol, preferaoly 6 to 8%/mol.  Whilst the comonomers employed in components (B) and (C) may be different, it is preferred if they are the same.<br>
When components (B) and (C) are combined the resulting ethylene copolymer composition (A) may have a weight average molecular weight of 50,000 to 200,000 g/mol, an MFR2 of 0.3 to 5.0 g/10 min, preferably 0.5 to 3.0 g/10 min and a density of 905 to 930 kg/m3, preferably 905 to 920 kg/m3.<br>
The weight ratio of components (B) and (C) in the composition (A) is between 30/70 to 60/40, preferably 35/65 to 45/55 and in particular 38/62 to 43/57.<br>
The components (B) and (C) are prepared using a single site catalyst, i.e. a catalyst comprising a metallocene procatalyst species.  Suitable metallocenes are well-known to the skilled person and include optionally substituted cyclopentadienyl, indenyl or fluorenyl metallocenes with Group III to VI metals.  In particular the n-ligand may be substituted by an alkyl or siloxy group as is known in the art.  Particularly -preferred metallocenes are disclosed in FI-A-9349167 and are based on a complex of formula X2HfCp2 wherein each X is independently'halogen, methyl, benzyl, amido or hydrogen; each Cp is independently a cyclopentadienyl substituted by a C1-10 linear or branched hydrocarbyl group.  Especially preferably the metallocene is a bis (n-butvlcyclopentadienyl) hafnium dihalide.<br><br>
Alternatively,   the  metallocene  may be  as   described in  FI-A-960437,    i.e.   a   siloxy-substituted bridged bisindenyl zirconium dihalide.<br>
Metallocene procatalysts  are preferably used in combination with a cocatalyst.     Suitable  cocatalysts include  aluminium alkyl   compounds.     While  the   aluminium alkyl  compound may be  an  aluminium trialkyl    (e.g. triethyl aluminium   (TEA) )   or an aluminium dialkyl  halide (e.g.   diethyl  aluminium chloride   (DEAC) ) ,   it   is preferably an alumoxane,   particularly MAO, isobutylalumoxane,   eg TIBAO   (tetraisobutylalumoxane)   or HIBAO   (hexaisobutylalumoxane) .     Alternatively the metallocene procatalysts may be used with other cocatalysts,   eg boron compounds  such as B(C6F5)3, C6H5N(CH3)2H:B(C6F5)4,     (C6H5) 3C:B (C6F5) 4 or  Ni (CKT) 4 [B (C6F5) 3] 42" . Again,   the use of   cocatalysts   is  known in the  art.<br>
The metallocene procatalyst  and  cocatalyst may be introduced into  the polymerization reactor  separately  or together or,   more preferably they are pre-reacted and their reaction product  is  introduced into the polymerization reactor.<br>
If  desired,   the procatalyst,   procatalyst/cocatalyst mixture  or a procatalyst/cocatalyst  reaction product may be used in unsupported form or it may be precipitated and used as  such.     However the metallocene procatalyst or its reaction product with the  cocatalyst   is preferably introduced into the polymerization reactor in supported form,   eg impregnated into  a porous particulate support.<br>
The particulate  support material used  is preferably an inorganic material,   especially preferably a metal  or pseudo metal  oxide  such  as  silica,   alumina  or   zirconia or a mixed oxide  such as  silica-alumina,   in particular silica,   alumina or silica-alumina.     Such supports  are well known in the  art.<br>
Especially preferably the  support   is  a porous material so  that  the metallocene may be  loaded  into  the<br><br>
pores  of  the   support,   e.g.   using  a process   analogous   to those  described  in W094/14856    (Mobil),   W095/12622 (Borealis)   and WO96/00243   (Exxon) .      The particle  size   is not  critical   but  is  preferably  in  the  range   5   to  200  µm, more preferably 20  to  8 0  µm.<br>
Before  loading,   the particulate   support  material   is preferably  calcined,   ie heat  treated,   preferably under  a non-reactive  gas  such as nitrogen.     This treatment   is preferably at  a temperature in excess  of  10 0°C,   more preferably  2 00°C or higher,   e.g.   200-800°C,   particularly about  :-.00°C.     the  calcination treatment  is  preferably effected  for  several  hours,   e.g.   2   to  3 0  hours,   more preferably  about  10  hours.<br>
The  support may be treated with  an alkylating agent before being  loaded with the metallocene.     Treatment with the alkylating agent may be effected using an alkylating agent  in a gas or liquid phase,   e.g.   in an organic  solvent  for the alkylating agent.     The alkylating agent may be any agent  capable  of  introducing alkyl  groups,   preferably C1-6 alkyl  groups  and most especially preferably methyl  groups.     Such agents  are well known in the field of  synthetic  organic  chemistry. Preferably the  alkylating agent  is  an organometallic compound,   especially an organoaluminium compound   (such as trimethyl aluminium   (TMA.) ,   dimethyl  aluminium chloride,   triethylaluminium)   or a compound such as methyl  lithium,   dimethyl magnesium,   triethylboron,   etc.<br>
The quantity of  alkylating agent used will  depend upon the number of active sites  on the  surface of  the carrier-.     Thus for example, . for a. silica ..support., surface  hydroxyls  are capable of  reacting with the alkylating  agent.     In general,   an  excess  of   alkylating agent  is preferably used with any unreacted alkylating agent  subsequently being washed away.<br>
The optionally alkylated support material is loaded with ~he procatalyst, preferably using a solution of the procatalyst   in an organic  solvent  therefor,   e.g.   as<br><br>
described in the patent publications referred to above. Preferably, the volume of procatalyst solution used is from 5C to 500% of the pore volume of the carrier, more especially preferably 80 to 120%.  The concentration of procatalyst compound in the solution used can vary from dilute to saturated depending on the amount of metallocene active sites that it is desired be loaded into the carrier pores.<br>
The active metal (ie. the metal of the procatalyst) is preferably loaded onto the support material at from 0.1 to 4%, pre'ferably 0.5 to 3.0%, especially 1.0 to 2.0%, by weight metal relative to the dry weight of the support material.<br>
After loading of the procatalyst onto the support material, the loaded support may be recovered for use in olefin polymerization, e.g. by separation of any excess procatalyst solution and if desired drying of the loaded support, optionally at elevated temperatures, e.g. 25 to 80°C.<br>
Alternatively, a cocatalyst, e.g. an alumoxane or an ionic catalyst activator (such as a boron or aluminium compound, especially a fluoroborate) may also be mixed with or loaded onto the catalyst support material.  This may be done subsequently or more preferably simultaneously to loading of the procatalyst, for example by including the cocatalyst in the solution of the procatalyst or, by contacting the procatalyst loaded support material with a solution of the cocatalyst or catalyst activator, e.g. a solution in an organic solvent.  Alternatively however any such further material may be added to the procatalyst loaded support material in the polymerization reactor or shortly before dosing of the catalyst material into the reactor.<br>
Where the further material is loaded onto the procatalyst loaded support material, the support may be recovered and if desired dxied before use in olefin polymerization.<br><br>
Components B and C may be prepared by conventional polymerisation processes, e.g. in slurry, gas or solution phase.  The low molecular weight component (B) is preferably produced in a slurry phase process employing for example a light hydrocarbon diluent such as propane or isobutane.<br>
For slurry reactors, the reaction temperature will generally be in the range 60 to 110°C (e.g. 65-75°C), the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 5 to 8 0 bar (e.g. 35-85 bar), and the residence time will generally be in the range 0.3 to 5 hours (e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours) .  The diluent used will generally be an aliphatic hydrocarbon having a boiling point in the range -70 to + 100°C.  In such reactors, polymerization may if desired be effected under supercritical conditions.<br>
The high molecular weight component (C) is preferably produced in a gas phase process.  For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature used will generally be in the range 60 to 115°C (e.g. 65 to 85DC), the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will generally be 1 to 8 hours.  The gas used will commonly be a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen together with monomer (e.g. ethylene).<br>
Components (B) and (C) may be blended using standard procedures although it is preferred if components B and C are produced in a cascaded process of two or more reactors operating at different conditions. In this way a more homogeneous polymer powder may be produced.  Thus, in one embodiment the reactors may be of the same type, e.g. two slurry phase reactors in series or two gas phase reactors.  Preferably however, the reactors are of different types and especially preferably the components (B) and (C) are produced by a slurry phase (e.g. loop reactor) and gas phase reactor in series.  Such a set up is described in EP-A-517B68 which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Using a cascaded slurry and gas phase reactor system, the low molecular weight component may be produced in the slurry reactor and the high molecular weight component produced in the gas phase reactor.<br>
Hydrogen may be introduced into a reactor to control the molecular weight of the polymer as is well-known and routine in the art.<br>
The concentration of hydrogen should be such that the low molecular weight component (E) has the desired specifiec MFR.  Due to high conversion rates of hydrogen, the required concentration of hydrogen in the reactor which produces the low molecular weight component is low.  Thus, when the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is between 0.4 and 1 mol hydrogen per 1 kmol of ethylene, a polymer having the desired MFR for the low molecular weight component is obtained.<br>
In order to produce the high molecular weight component it is also possible to use hydrogen in, for example, the gas phase reactor although it is preferred if no additional hydrogen is added over and above that used in the reactor which produces the low molecular weight component.  If additional hydrogen is used, this should be at very low concentration e.g. the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene should be lower than 0.4 mol/kmol, preferably less than 0.3 mol/kmol and in particular less than 0.2 mol/kmol.  Clearly, the concentration of hydrogen is such that components with the desired molecular weights are produced.<br>
Comonomer is introduced into the reactors to control the density of the components (B) and (C) and the amount of comonomer employed depends on the desired density of the components.  Higher alpha olefins need to be present in greater concentrations than lower alpha olefins to ensure the same density.  A suitable alpha olefin to ethylene ratio range for 1-butene comonomer is from about 100 mol to about 500 mol comonomer per 1 kmol of ethylene.<br><br>
The amount of comonomer used in the gas phase reactoi if l-butene is the comonomer may range from 50 to 15 0 mol, preferably 50 to 100 mol per kmol of ethylene.  There is however no requirement that the comonomers used in high and low molecular weight components be the same.<br>
Where a cascade slurry, gas phase reactor system is used the polymer is collected continuously or intermittently from the slurry (loop) reactor, hydrocarbons are removed from the polymer and the resultant polymer is introduced into the gas phase reactor.  These procedures are well-known and. would be carried out readily by the person skilled in the art.<br>
The core layer may comprise any film grade polymer resin having the desired properties and processability. Thus, it may be a low density polyethylene (LDPE) resin produced in a high pressure process.  Alternatively, it may be a linear low density polymer (LLDPE) resin produced by polymerising ethylene and alpha-olefin comonomers in the presence of a Ziegler, chromium or metallocene catalyst.  Especially preferred materials in this respect are bimodal LLDPE resins, like those referred to in WO 99/64509 which have outstanding mechanical properties as well as excellent processability.<br>
Alternatively, the core may comprise a polar copolymer resin of ethylene, such as a copolymer of ethylene and a vinyl alcohol or a copolymer of ethylene and an' acrylate monomer.  The core may also comprise a medium -density-polyethylene resin.  Especially preferred resins of this class are the bimodal MDPE resins, such as those described in WO 99/41310.  Moreover, the core layer may comprise a high density polyethylene resin of which preferred members are described in WO 99/51649 and are bimodal.<br>
It is possible to use an adhesive layer between the core layer and the sealing layer to improve adhesion<br><br>
between these two layers.  The adhesive layer may be a polymer naving a good adhesion to the polymers of the sealing and core layers.  Such adhesive polymers have been widely discussed in the art and may be ionomers, copolymers of ethylene and ethyl acrylate etc.  If the layers ere to be laminated, then glues may also be employee to improve adhesion.<br>
As previously mentioned, the films of the invention may comprise additional layers over and above the sealing and core layers.  The nature and number of these layers is determined by the use of the film although in normal applications additional layers would not be required.  In such a case, the film surface -would comprise, for example, an LDPE resin from the core layer.  If a film is to be used in an environment where a barrier against oxygen would be desirable,   it is preferred if the outside of the core layer Is covered by a layer comprising ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer resins.<br>
Methods of producing heat suitable films are well-known in the art.  In one embodiment, the sealing layer, core layer and optional additional layers are coextruded to produce the suitable film structure.  The coextruded film is then blown to a film.<br>
In another embodiment, the layers are produced separately and are laminated together.  It is of course possible to coextrude the sealing and core layer and then laminate on the optional additional layers or coextrude the core layer and optional additional layer and laminate with the sealing layer.  All these various preparations are well-known to the skilled artisan.<br>
The heat sealable films of the invention, comprising the sealing layer, core layer and optional further additional layers preferably have sealing windows of at least 2 0°C, more preferably at least 30DC. Moreover, heat sealing is preferably possible at temperature below 100C.  By sealing window is meant the<br><br>
range   cf  temperature  at which  successful   sealing  of  the films  cf  the  invention to  the   article  to be   sealed may be  achieved.<br>
The hot-tack  force with the  films  of   the  invention is prei erably  at   least   0.5 N/15mm,   more  preferably  at least   I-  N/I5mm,   especially 1.5  N/l5mm.<br>
The  invention will now be   further  described with reference to the  following non-limiting  examples  and Figures   in which:<br>

Example 1;<br>
134 g of a metallocene complex (TA02 823 by Vtfitco, n-butyl dicyclopentadienyl hafnium dichloride containing 0.3 6 % by weight Hf) and 9.57 kg of a 3 0 % MAO solution supplied by Albemarle were combined and 3.18 kg dry, purified toluene was added. The thus obtained complex solution was added on 17 kg silica carrier Sylopol 55 SJ by Grace. The complex was fed very slowly with uniform spraying during 2 hours. Temperature was kept below 30 °-C. The mixture, was allowed to react for '3 h after complex addition at 3 0 °C.<br>
The thus obtained catalyst was dried under nitrogen for 6h at 75°C temperature. After nitrogen drying the catalyst was further dried under vacuum for lOh.<br>
This catalyst is referred to as catalyst B in the<br><br>
subsequent examples.<br>
Example 2:<br>
16 8 g of metallocene complex (bridged siloxy-substituted bis-indenyl zirconium dichloride, according to a patent application FI 960437) and 9.67 kg of a 30 % MAO solution supplied by Albemarle were combined and 3.18 kg dry, purified toluene was added. The thus obtained complex solution was added on 9 kg silica carrier SP9-243 by Grace having average particle size of 2 0 microns, pore volume of 1.5-1.7 mm3 and specific surface area of 35 0-4 00 m2/g . The complex was fed very slowly with uniform spraying during 2 hours. Temperature was kept below 30C. The mixture was allowed to react for 2 h after complex addition at 30°C.<br>
The thus obtained catalyst was dried under nitrogen for 6h at 75CC temperature. After nitrogen drying the catalyst was further dried under vacuum for 10 h.<br>
This catalyst is referred to as catalyst A in the sub s e guent examp1es.<br>
Example 3;<br>
Into a  continuously operating loop reactor  of  500  dm3 volume  was   fed ethylene,  propane  diluent,   1-butene comonomer and hydrogen together with the  catalyst prepared according to Example 1  so that  a polymer havinc MFR  and density according to Table 1  was  formed'"at'a ^ rate  of  about  3 0  kg/h.   The polymer slurry was continuously withdrawn  from the   reactor,   the hydrocarbons were removed and the polymer containing the active  catalyst was transferred  into  a gas  phase reactor where  the polymerization was  continued by adding ethylene and 1-butene comonomer.   The polymer was<br><br>
collected from the  gas phase  reactor  at  such  a rate   that the  production split was  as   indicated  in Table  1.   The polymei   was   compounded together with  additives.   The  MFR and  der.sity  of  the pelletized polymer  is  shown in  Table<br>
1.<br>

The procedure  of  Example  3  was  repeated,   except  that   a catalyst  prepared  according  to  Example   2  was  used   and that   the polymer properties  were  as   indicated  in Table<br>
1.<br>
Table  1:   Polymerization data<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example 8;<br>
The pclymers produced in Examples 3-7 were then analyzed by using TREF. The data of the analysis is shown in Table 2 . The fractograms are shown in Figure 1.<br>
Comparative Examples 1-6;<br>
Commercially available materials LE652 0 (CE1, unimodal Ziegler based PE)   Elite "5400 (CE2, metallocene based PE) , Elite 5110 (CE3, metallocene based PE) , Luflexen 0322HX (CE4, metallocene based PE) , ml8Pfax (CE5, metallocene based PE) and mPactD144 (CE6, metallocene based PE) were analyzed by TREF. The data is shown in Table 2. Fractograms are shown in Figure 2 .<br><br>

(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
Example   9:<br>
The polymers prepared  in Examples  3-7   were blown  into   a film on a Windmoller  &amp; Holscher blown  film line.   A   60  mm extruder with  length  to  diameter   (L/D)   ratio  of   3 0   was used.   The  die   diameter was   2 00  mm and the   die   gap  was 2.3  mm.   Blow-up  ratio   (BUR)   was  2.5   and the   frost   line height   (FLH)   was  450  mm.   The  output  was   60  kg/h.   A  dual lip   "Unifow'   cooling  ring was  used.   Data is   shown  in Table  3.<br>
Table  3:   Blown film and  sealing  data<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
Example 10;<br>
The films prepared in Example 8 were put to a hot tack test to measure the sealability. Two film samples were pressed together at elevated temperature. The sealing time was 0.5 seconds, the lag time was 0.1 seconds and the sealing pressure was 90 N for a specimen width 15 mm. The film thickness was 40 µm. The force required to break the seal was then measured.  The data is shown in Figure 3.<br>
Comparison of hot tack data and TREF fractograms reveals that when a sufficient amount of material elutes at a temperature of below 5 0°C, a hot tack curve with a wide temperature window extending to low temperature is<br><br>
obtained.   Especially this   is  true   for material   prepared in Example  3.<br>
Example   11:<br>
The materials  of  Example  3   and Example  5  were   coextruded to  a  three-layer  film on  a Reifenhauser  blown  film  line. The  core layer and the  inner layer  consisted of  a bimodal   linear low density ethylene polymer manufactured and  sold by Borealis under a  trade name  of   LE6592.   The material of  Example 3  was used for the  sealing  layer. The  sealing,   core  and inner layer had  a  thickness   of   14, 13   and  13 microns,,   respectively.<br>
Die  diameter was  200 ram,   die gap was   1.0 mm and BUR. was 2.5.<br>
Also 4  other materials  were  tested as   outer  layers, these were Dow Affinity PL1B81   (metallocene material) , Dowlex NC5056E,   LE0601   (LD for lamination)    and LE6504 (LLD for lamination) .   Data is  shown in Table  4.<br>
