The present invention relates to an improvement of a locking device comprising: a plate-like key in which specific identification means is incorporated; a key insertion portion provided in a device body to allow the plate-like key to be inserted; and recognition means provided in the key insertion portion and capable of recognizing the identification means of the plate-like key inserted into the key insertion portion, wherein an object to be locked can be operated when the recognition means recognizes the identification means, and also relates to operating device locking system equipped with the locking device. [DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART]<br>
Such a locking device is already known, as disclosed in, for example. Published Japanese Translation No. 2003-507253 of PCT/EPOO/07769.<br>
In the conventional locking device, recognition means is configured to recognize identification means of a plate-like key after the plate-like key is completely inserted into a key insertion portion.    With the locking device, when a user has a plurality of plate-like keys with different identification means and inserts a wrong plate-like key that is not recognized by the recognition means into the key insertion portion, the recognition means does not perform the recognition until the plate-like key is completely inserted into the key insertion portion.    Thus, the insertion operation of the plate-like key into the depth of the key insertion portion becomes useless. [SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such a circumstance, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a locking device with good operability for enabling recognition means to operate in the middle of insertion of a plate-like key into a key operation portion to thereby stop a further useless insertion operation of the plate-like<br>
 <br>
key when the plate-like key is not a legitimate key, and also to provide an operating device locking system equipped with the locking device.<br>
In order to achieve the object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided a locking device comprising: a plate-like key in which specific identification means is incorporated; a key insertion portion provided in a device body to allow the plate-like key to be inserted; and recognition means provided in the key insertion portion and capable of recognizing the identification means of the plate-like key inserted into the key insertion portion, wherein an object to be locked can be operated when the recognition means recognizes the identification means, characterized in that the recognition means is arranged so as to be able to recognize the identification means in the middle of insertion of the plate-like key into the key insertion portion, insertion restricting means for blocking further insertion of the plate-like key when the recognition means cannot recognize the identification means is provided in the key insertion portion, and the object to be locked can be operated when the plate-like key is inserted into a predetermined insertion hold position by restriction release by the insertion restricting means.    Here, the object to be locked corresponds to an operating device 2 of an embodiment of the present invention, which will be described below.<br>
Further, according to a second feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the key insertion portion comprises an outer key case fixed to the device body and an inner key case capable of receiving a part of the plate-like key and slidably fitted to the outer key case, the inner key case is movable between an initial position upon receiving a part of the plate-like key and the insertion hold position for allowing the plate-like key to be entirely inserted into the key insertion portion, and the insertion restricting means restrains the inner key case at the initial position when the recognition means cannot recognize the identification means.<br>
Further, according to a third feature of the present invention, in addition to the second feature, the insertion restricting means comprises: a pivoting member pivotally supported on the outer key case; a cam provided in the inner key case and pivoting the<br>
 <br>
pivoting member in conjunction with movement of the inner key case between the initial position and the insertion hold position; and a magnet lock provided between the outer key case and the pivoting member and blocking pivoting of the pivoting member when locked, the magnet lock comprises a recognition magnet as the recognition means, and the plateÂ¬like key comprises an identification magnet corresponding to the recognition magnet as the identification means.<br>
Further, according to a fourth feature of the present invention, in addition to the second or third feature, a restoring spring for urging the inner key case toward the initial position is connected to the inner key case, a push-latch mechanism for alternately locking the inner key case at the insertion hold position and releasing the lock every time an insertion operation of the inner key case is performed is provided between the inner and outer key cases, and retaining means for preventing the plate-like key from disengaging from the inner key case when the inner key case is at the insertion hold position is provided between the inner key case and the plate-like key.<br>
Further, according to a fifth feature of the present invention, there is provided an operating device locking system having the locking device according to the first feature, comprising: an operating device for operating an object to be operated via an intermediate drive shaft connected to an operation knob supported on a device body by pivoting the operation knob; and the locking device comprising: a plate-like key in which specific identification means is incorporated; an outer key case fixed to the device body; an inner key case capable of sliding between a predetermined initial position and a predetermined insertion hold position while receiving a part of the plate-like key inside the outer key case; recognition means capable of recognizing the identification means of the plate-like key received in the inner key case at the initial position of the inner key case; and insertion restricting means for blocking insertion of the inner key case into the insertion hold position when the recognition means cannot recognize the identification means and for allowing insertion of the inner key case into the insertion hold position when the recognition means can recognize the identification means at the time of inserting the plate-<br>
 <br>
like key into the inner key case, wherein rotational operation restricting means for blocking rotation of the intermediate drive shaft at the initial position of the inner key case and allowing rotation of the intermediate drive shaft at the insertion hold position of the inner key case is provided between the intermediate drive shaft and the inner key case.    Here, the object to be operated corresponds to a power switch 3 and a steering lock device 4 of an embodiment of the present invention, which will be described below.<br>
Further, according to a sixth feature of the present invention, in addition to the fifth feature, the rotational operation restricting means comprises a restricting bar formed integrally with the inner key case, and a restricting slot which is formed in the intermediate drive shaft and with which the restricting bar engages, the restricting slot blocking rotation of the intermediate drive shaft at the initial position of the inner key case and allowing rotation of the intermediate drive shaft at the insertion hold position of the inner key case.<br>
Further, according to a seventh feature of the present invention, in addition to the sixth feature, the intermediate drive shaft comprises a first intermediate drive shaft slidably spline-fitted to the operation knob and connected to the inner key case via the restricting bar, and a second intermediate drive shaft slidably supported on the device body while enclosing the first intermediate drive shaft, a clutch switched between an OFF state at the initial position of the inner key case and an ON state at the insertion hold position of the inner key case is provided between the first and second intermediate drive shafts, and the operation knob and the second intermediate drive shaft are connected via a torque limiter for generating sliding between the operation knob and the second intermediate drive shaft when a drive torque from the operation knob to the second intermediate drive shaft reaches a predetermined value or more.    Here, the clutch corresponds to a male spline 12a and a female spline 13a of an embodiment of the present invention, which will be described below. [EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION]<br>
With the first feature of the present invention, when the plate-like key inserted into the key insertion portion is not legitimate, the identification means on the plate-like key<br>
 <br>
side does not match the recognition means on the outer key case side.    Thus, the recognition means cannot recognize the identification means, and the insertion restricting means blocks the movement of the inner key case to the insertion hold position.    A user can thereby learn, at this point, that the plate-like key is not legitimate without inserting the plate-like key deep into the outer key case, so that the useless operation can be prevented. Accordingly, the plate-like key can be inserted into the insertion hold position only when the plate-like key is legitimate, so that the object to be locked can be operated.<br>
With the second feature of the present invention, when the plate-like key received in the inner key case is not legitimate, the inner key case is restrained at the initial position by the insertion restricting means.    Accordingly, the useless insertion operation of the plateÂ¬like key is prevented and the operability can be improved.<br>
With the third feature of the present invention, the insertion restricting means includes the pivoting member pivotally supported on the outer key case, the cam provided in the inner key case and pivoting the pivoting member in conjunction with the movement of the inner key case between the initial position and the insertion hold position, and the magnet lock provided between the outer key case and the pivoting member and blocking pivoting of the pivoting member when locked, the magnet lock including the recognition magnet as the recognition means, and the plate-like key including the identification magnet corresponding to the recognition magnet as the identification means.    Accordingly, the magnet lock which is relatively inexpensive can be used for the insertion restricting means, thereby the locking device can be reduced in cost.<br>
With the fourth feature of the present invention, when the inner key case is inserted into the insertion hold position by using the legitimate plate-like key, the inner key case can be restrained at the insertion hold position by the push-latch mechanism, and the plate-like key can be also prevented from disengaging from the inner key case by the retaining means.<br>
With the fifth feature of the present invention, when the plate-like key received in the inner key case is not legitimate, the identification means on the piate-like key side does not match the recognition means on the outer key case side.    Thus, the recognition means<br>
 <br>
cannot recognize the identification means, and the inner key case is still held at the initial position by the insertion restricting means.    Accordingly, pivoting of the intermediate drive shaft of the operating device is blocked by the rotational operation restricting means provided between the intermediate drive shaft and the inner key case, so that the pivoting operation of the operation knob is disabled.    When the plate-like key is legitimate, the restriction is released by the insertion restricting means.    By inserting the inner key case into the insertion hold position, the restriction by the rotational operation restricting means is released.    Subsequently, by pivoting the operation knob, the object to be operated can be operated via the intermediate drive shaft.    Accordingly, only a single plate-like key in which the identification means is incorporated is required, and only a single key operation is required.    Therefore, the structure can be simplified and the operability can be improved.<br>
With the sixth feature of the present invention, the rotation of the operation knob and the intermediate drive shaft can be restricted by simple rotational operation restricting means.<br>
With the seventh feature of the present invention, when a person who does not have the legitimate plate-like key forcibly rotates the operation knob 11 by mischief, only the operation knob is rotated due to the sliding action of the torque limiter, so that the operation knob, the second intermediate drive shaft or the like can be protected from an overload. Furthermore, the clutch between the first intermediate drive shaft and the second intermediate drive shaft is in an OFF state at the initial position of the inner key case. Thus, even when the first intermediate drive shaft is rotated by the operation knob, the rotation is not transmitted to the second intermediate drive shaft.    Accordingly, the improper operation of the object to be operated can be prevented.<br>
The above-mentioned object, other objects, characteristics, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from an explanation of a preferred embodiment, which will be described in detail below by reference to the attached drawings. [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS]<br>

In the following, a preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be described by reference to the attached drawings.<br>
First, in FIGS. 1 to 4, an operating device 2 as an object to be locked, a power switch 3 turned ON/OFF by the operating device 2, a steering lock device 4 locked/unlocked by the operating device 2, and a locking device 6 for enabling the operating device 2 to be locked/unlocked are provided in a device body 1 having a display panel 5 that is mounted on a head pipe (not shown) of a vehicle, for example, a two-wheeled motor vehicle.    The components will be sequentially described below.    In the<br>
 <br>
following description, the front direction of the display panel 5 is referred to as front and the back direction thereof is referred to as back. <operating device power switch and steering lock><br>
In FIGS. 1 to 3, the device body 1 includes the display panel 5, and a support cylinder 7 screwed to the back surface of the display panel 5 and employing a hollow portion as a slide bore 7a.    A ring-shaped decorative ferrule 8 arranged coaxially with the slide bore 7a and a connection cylinder 10 having a stopper surface 10a facing the front end of the support cylinder 7 and connecting the decorative ferrule 8 and the support cylinder 7 are provided in the display panel 5.<br>
A hat-shaped body portion 11a of an operation knob 11 is rotatably and slidably fitted to the decorative ferrule 8 and the support cylinder 7.    A flange lib at the back end of the body portion 11a alternately abuts against the stopper surface 10a and the front end of the support cylinder 7, so that a sliding stroke of the operation knob 11 is restricted.<br>
The operation knob 11 further includes a knob lie projecting outward from the ceiling wall of the body portion 11a, and a drive shaft lid projecting coaxially with the knob lie from the ceiling portion of the body portion Ua toward the support cylinder 7. A hollow cylindrical first intermediate drive shaft 12 is slidably spline-fitted onto the outer periphery of the drive shaft lid.    The first intermediate drive shaft 12 is urged toward the operation knob 11 by a restoring spring 14.    A hollow cylindrical second intermediate drive shaft 13 is arranged on the outer periphery of the first intermediate drive shaft 12. The second intermediate drive shaft 13 is rotatably and slidably fitted to the slide bore 7a.<br>
A male spline 12a and a female spline 13a engaging with each other when the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is moved a predetermined distance from an initial position on the operation knob 11 side (see FIG. 3) to the back are formed respectively on the outer periphery of the first intermediate drive shaft 12 and the inner periphery of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 (see FIGS. 5 and 16).    That is, the male spline 12a and the female spline 13a constitute a clutch that is switched between an OFF state and an ON state according to the front position and the back position of the first intermediate drive shaft 12.<br>
 <br>
A torque limiter 15 for limiting torque transmission from the operation knob 11 to the second intermediate drive shaft 13 to a predetermined value or less is provided between the operation knob 11 and the front end of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 as shown in FIGS. 3, 10 and 11.    The torque limiter 15 includes a trapezoidal wavelike drive cam 16 formed on the back end surface of the body portion 11a of the operation knob 11 in the circumferential direction, a trapezoidal wavelike follow cam 17 formed on the front end surface of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 in the circumferential direction to engage with the drive cam 16 in a disengageable manner, and a set spring 18 for urging the second intermediate drive shaft 13 with a predetermined set load in the engaging direction of the drive and follow cams 16 and 17.    Accordingly, the limit of torque transmission from the operation knob 11 to the second intermediate drive shaft 13 is determined by the set load of the set spring 18 and the inclination of inclined surfaces abutting against each other of the drive and follow cams 16 and 17.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 3,12, 13 and 15, a follow shaft 20 is relative-slidably connected to the back end portion of the second intermediate drive shaft 13.    The follow shaft 20 includes a canopy portion 20a rotatably fitted to the slide bore 7a, an output shaft portion 20b projecting backward from the center portion of the canopy portion 20a, and a guide shaft portion 20c projecting frontward from the center portion of the canopy portion 20a into the first intermediate drive shaft 12.    The output shaft portion 20b has a crank 21 and a positioning flange 22 in the intermediate portion.   The output shaft portion 20b is disposed such that the tip end portion thereof projects into a switch case 25 formed integrally with the back end portion of the support cylinder 7 and the positioning flange 22 abuts against the front end wall of the switch case 25.<br>
The restoring spring 14 is provided in a compressed state between the canopy portion 20a and the first intermediate drive shaft 12 while enclosing the guide shaft portion 20c of the follow shaft 20.    The set spring 18 is provided in a compressed state between the canopy portion 20a and the second intermediate-drive shaft 13.    Accordingly, the restoring spring 14 and the set spring 18 also function to maintain the positioning flange 22<br>
 <br>
at the abutting position against the front end wall of the switch case 25 by urging the follow shaft 20 backward.<br>
A plurality of connection holes 23 are provided in the circumferential direction in the canopy portion 20a.    A plurality of connection claws 24 projecting at the back end of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 engage with the connection holes 23 in an axially slidable manner.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the power switch 3 is housed in the switch case 25.    The power switch 3 includes a movable contact point holder 3a connected to the tip end of the output shaft portion 20b to hold a movable contact point, and a fixed contact point holder 3b fixed to the switch case 25 to hold a fixed contact point operating in conjunction with the movable contact point as in a conventional case.    The movable contact point holder 3a is driven by the operation knob 11 via the first and second intermediate drive shafts 12 and 13 and the follow shaft 20, to be thereby pivoted between a power OFF position "OFF" and a power ON position "ON" (see FIG. 1).<br>
Meanwhile, a guide hole 27 is provided penetrating the side wall of the support cylinder 7 in the radial direction on one side of the crank 21.    The guide hole 27 slidably supports a steering lock pin 30 capable of engaging with and disengaging from a lock hole 29 of a steering stem 28 of a two-wheeled motor vehicle.    The crank 21 is connected to operate with an operating plate 31 that is fixed to the inner end of the steering lock pin 30. When the operation knob 11 is pivoted from the power OFF position "OFF" to a steering lock position "LOCK" on the side opposite from the power ON position "ON", the steering lock pin 30 is allowed to proceed into the lock hole 29, and when the operation knob 11 is at the other operation positions "ON" and "OFF", the steering lock pin 30 is pulled out of the lock hole 29.    Furthermore, an unlock spring 32 for urging the steering lock pin 30 in a direction to be pulled out of the lock hole 29 is provided in a compressed state between the support cylinder 7 and the steering lock pin 30.    Accordingly, the crank 21, the operating plate 31, the steering lock pin 30, and the unlock spring 32 constitute the steering lock device 4.<br>
 <br>
<locking device><br>
In FIGS. 1 to 3 and 17, an insertion port 35 with a shutter 36 for a plate-Iike ke}' 34 is provided adjacent to the operation knob 11 in the display panel 5.    An outer key case 37 having a hollow portion continuous with the insertion port 35 is connected to one side of the support cylinder 7.    The outer key case 37 has a box shape that extends longitudinally along the axis of the support cylinder 7 and is flattened in the radial direction of the support cylinder 7.    An inner key case 38 capable of receiving the tip end portion of the plate-like key 34 is fitted in the outer key case 37 so as to be slidable between an initial position A (see FIGS. 4 and 17) on the display panel 5 side and an insertion hold position B (see FIGS. 5 and 18) on the back end wall side of the outer key case 37.    At this point, the sliding direction of the inner key case 38 inside the outer key case 37 is set to be parallel to the axial direction of the slide bore 7a of the support cylinder 7, that is, the sliding direction of the first and second intermediate drive shafts 12 aiid 13.<br>
In FIGS. 4 and 17, insertion restricting means 40 capable of restraining the inner key case 38 at the initial position A is provided between the outer and inner key cases 37 and 38. The insertion restricting means 40 includes a pivoting member 41 having a cup-shaped hub 41a that is rotatably fitted to a circular boss 37a formed on the outer wall of the outer key case 37, and a fixed core 42 relative-rotatably fitted to the hub 41a and fixed to the outer wall of the outer key case 37 by a screw 43.    The pivoting member 41 has an arm 41b projecting in the radial direction from the hub 41a.    An engaging pin 41c is provided projecting toward the inner key case 38 at the tip end portion of the arm 41b.    Meanwhile, a cam 45 with which the engaging pin 41c slidably engages is formed in the inner key case 38.    The cam 45 includes a cutout-shaped inclined groove 45a (see FIG. 17) into which the engaging pin 41c deeply proceeds with the arm 41b being at a diagonally backward position when the inner key case 38 occupies the initial position A, and a flat surface 45b extending in the sliding direction of the inner key case 38 from the opening edge of the inclined groove 45a toward the inlet of the inner key case 38.    The engaging pin 41c is moved from the engaging position with the inclined groove 45a to the engaging position<br>
 <br>
with the flat surface 45b (see FIG. 18) when the inner key case 38 is moved from the initial position A to the insertion hold position B, to thereby pivot the arm 41b, that is, the pivoting member 41.    Thus, by blocking the pivoting of the pivoting member 41 at the initial position A of the inner key case 38, the inner key case 38 can be restrained at the initial position A, and by releasing the pivoting restraint, the inner key case 38 can be moved to the insertion hold position B.    A cutout 47 is provided at the outer end of the hub 41a.    The cutout width of the cutout 47 is set so as to limit the pivoting angle of the pivoting member 41 by receiving a fixed arm 42a projecting in the radial direction of the fixed core 42.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4 and 17, a magnet lock 50 for controlling the pivoting restraint and restraint release of the pivoting member 41 is provided between the fixed core 42 and the hub 41a.    The hub 41a is disposed such that the end surface thereof is flush with the inner surface of the inner key case 38 so as not to prevent the inner key case 38 from sliding.    The magnet lock 50 includes a plurality of magnet support holes 51 formed at predetermined positions of the end surface of the fixed core 42 facing the hub 41a, a plurality of pin-shaped recognition magnets 52 slidably fitted into the magnet support holes 51, springs 53 housed in the magnet support holes 51 to urge the recognition magnets 52 in a projecting direction, and a plurality of lock holes 54 formed in the surface of the hub 41a facing the fixed core 42 and with which the tip end portions of all the recognition magnets 52 engage due to the urging force of the springs 53 when the pivoting member 41 is at the initial position A.    Accordingly, the recognition magnets 52 restrain the pivoting member 41 at the initial position A (see FIG. 3) by engaging with the lock holes 54 and allows the pivoting of the pivoting member 41 (see FIG. 4) by disengaging from the lock holes 54.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, a plurality of identification magnets 55 enabling the recognition magnets 52 to disengage from the lock holes 54 when the plate-like key 34 is inserted into the inner key case 38 are incorporated in the plate-like key 34.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 17 to 20, a push-latch mechanism 56 for alternately locking the inner key case 38 at the insertion hold position B and releasing the lock every time the<br>
 <br>
insertion operation of tlie inner key case 38 is performed is provided between the outer key case 37 and the inner key case 38.    The push-!atch mechanism 56 is a well known mechanism which includes a latch arm 58 slidably pivotally-supported 57 on the back end portion of the inner key case 38, and a heart-shaped one-way circulation groove 59 formed in the inner surface of the outer key case 37 and with which a latch pin 58a at the tip end of the latch arm 58 engages.    The one-way circulation groove 59 includes a go-groove 59a (see FIG. 17) for receiving the latch pin 58a and allowing the insertion of the inner key case 38 from the initial position A, a stopper concave portion 59b (see FIG. 19) for receiving the latch pin 58a after a first insertion operation of the inner key case 38 to an insertion limit position (see FIG. 18) to lock the inner key case 38 at the insertion hold position B, and a' return-groove 59c for returning the latch pin 58a to the go-groove 59a after a second insertion operation of the inner key case 38 to an insertion limit position (see FIG. 20). Therefore, according to the first insertion operation of the inner key case 38, the inner key case 38 is restrained at the insertion hold position, and according to the second insertion operation, the restraint can be released.    That is, it is necessary to insert the inner key case 38 into the insertion limit position exceeding the insertion hold position B at which the inner key case 38 is to be locked in both the first and second insertion operations of the inner key case 38.<br>
As also shown in FIGS. 17 to 20, when the inner key case 38 receiving the plate-like key 34 comes to the insertion hold position B, the plate-like key 34 is prevented from disengaging from the inner key case 38 by retaining means 60.    The retaining means 60 includes an engaging concave portion 61 (see FIG. 1) formed at the side end of the plateÂ¬like key 34, a slidable elastic engaging arm 62 extending from one side edge of a window hole 67 of the side wall of the inner key case 38 facing the engaging concave portion 61 toward the other side edge thereof and having an expanded head portion 62a capable of engaging with and disengaging from the engaging concave portion 61 at the tip end, and an engagement release concave portion 69 formed in the inner surface facing the engaging concave portion 61 of the plate-like key 34 and capable of receiving the expanded head<br>
 <br>
portion 62a.    The elastic engaging arm 62 is formed integrally with the inner key case 38. Accordingly, when the inner key case 38 is at the initial position A (see FIG. 17), the expanded head portion 62a can freely enter and exit the engagement release concave portion 69 of the outer key case 37.    Thus, the plate-like key 34 can be freely inserted into and retracted from the inner key case 38 while pushing away the expanded head portion 62a toward the engagement release concave portion 69.    When the inner key case 38 is inserted into the insertion hold position B (see FIGS. 18 to 20), the plate-like key 34 cannot disengage from the inner key case 38 since the expanded head portion 62a is pushed into the engaging concave portion 61 of the plate-like key 34 by the flat inner surface of the outer key case 37.<br>
In FIGS. 4 and 17, a restricting bar 39 is formed integrally with the inner key case 38.    The restricting bar 39 penetrates an opening portion 68 formed in the side wall of the outer key case 37, a guide groove 64 formed in the side wall of the support cylinder 7, and a restricting slot 65 provided in the side wall of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 to engage with a ring-shaped connection groove 12b on the outer periphery at the back end portion of the first intermediate drive shaft 12.    Accordingly, the restricting bar 39 and the connection groove 12b can transmit the axial movement of the inner key case 38 to the first intermediate drive shaft 12 and also allows the rotation of the first intermediate drive shaft 12.<br>
The guide groove 64 extends linearly in the sliding direction of the inner key case 38 being inside the outer key case 37.    The restricting bar 39 engaging with the guide groove 64 can transmit the movement of the inner key case 38 to the first intermediate drive shaft 12.<br>
The restricting slot 65 includes first and second longitudinal slots 65a and 65b parallel to the axis of the slide bore 7a of the support cylinder 7, a relatively short first lateral slot 65c extending from the back end portion of the first longitudinal slot 65a to a direction opposite from the second longitudinal slot 65b, and a second lateral slot 65d for connecting the back end portions of the first and second longitudinal slots 65a and 65b as<br>
 <br>
shown in FIG. 4(B).    The first and second longitudinal slots 65a and 65b (see FIGS. 4(B) and 8(B)) allows the axial movement relative to the restricting bar 39 so as to enable the inner key case 38 to be moved between the initial position A and the insertion hold position B when the operation knob 11 is at the power OFF position "OFF" and the steering lock position "LOCK".    The first lateral slot 65c (see FIGS. 5(B) and 6(B)) allows the circumferential movement relative to the restricting bar 39 so as to enable the operation knob 11 to be pivoted between the power OFF position "OFF" and the power ON position "ON" when the inner key case 38 is at the insertion hold position B.    The second lateral slot 65d (see FIGS. 7(B) and 8(B)) allows the circumferential movement relative to the restricting bar 39 so as to enable the operation knob 11 to be pivoted between the power OFF position "OFF" and the steering lock position "LOCK" in a pushed state when the inner key case 38 is at the insertion hold position B.   An inclined surface 66 for facilitating the relative movement of the restricting bar 39 between the second longitudinal slot 65b and the second lateral slot 65d is formed between the second longitudinal slot 65b and the second lateral slot 65d.    The restricting bar 39 and the restricting slot 65 constitute rotational operation restricting means for restricting the rotation of the second intermediate drive shaft 13.<br>
Next, the operation of the embodiment will be described.<br>
Suppose that the inner key case 38 is empty and the operation knob 11 is at the power OFF position "OFF" as shown in FIG. 3.    In this state, the first intermediate drive shaft 12 pressurized toward the operation knob 11 by the urging force of the restoring spring 14 pressurizes the inner key case 38 to the initial position A via the restricting bar 39. The initial position A of the inner key case 38 is defined with the restricting bar 39 abutting against the front end wall of the guide groove 64 of the support cylinder 7.    At the initial position A of the inner key case 38, the inner key case 38 is locked by the insertion restricting means 40 having the magnet lock 50, and the male spline 12a of the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is spaced away from the female spline 13a of the second intermediate drive shaft 13.<br>
 <br>
The restricting bar 39 engages with the first longitudinal slot 65a of the restricting slot 65 of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 to thereby block the rotation of the second intermediate drive shaft 13.   As shown in FIG. 10, in the torque limiter 15 provided between the second intermediate drive shaft 13 and the operation knob 11, the drive and follow cams 16 and 17 are in an engaging state by the set load of the set spring 18 (see FIG. 3) to thereby maintain the operation knob 11 at the power OFF position "OFF".    If the operation knob 11 is forcibly rotated by mischief in such a state, the drive and follow cams 16 and 17 slide on each other, and only the second intermediate drive shaft 13 is moved backward as shown in FIG. 11.    Thus, the OFF state of the power switch 3 can be maintained, and the operation knob 11, the second intermediate drive shaft 13 and the like can be protected from an overload.    Furthermore, since the male spline 12a of the first intermediate drive shaft 12 and the female spline 13a of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 are not in an engaging state at the initial position A of the inner key case 38, the rotation of the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is not transmitted to the second intermediate drive shaft 13 even when the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is rotated by the operation knob 11. Accordingly, the OFF state of the power switch 3 is maintained, and the improper operation of the power switch 3 can be prevented.    The operation as described above of the torque limiter 15 is also generated similarly in a steering lock state described below.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4 and 17, when the plate-like key 34 is inserted into the inner key case 38 from the insertion port 35 of the display panel 5 to drive the two-wheeled motor vehicle, the identification magnets 55 of the plate-like key 34 face the recognition magnets 52 of the magnet lock 50 of the outer key case 37.    At this time, if the plate-like key 34 is not legitimate, such identification magnets 55 are not recognized by the recognition magnets 52, and the magnet lock 50 maintains a locked state to block pivoting of the pivoting member 41.    Thus, the pivoting member 41 is maintained in a state in which the engaging pin 41c engages with the inclined groove 45a of the inner key case 38, that is, the insertion restricting means 40 is in a locked state.    Accordingly, the inner key case 38 is prevented from being moved to the insertion hold position B.    A user thereby<br>
 <br>
learns at this point that the plate-like key 34 is not legitimate without inserting the plateÂ¬like key 34 deep into the outer key case 37, so that the useless operation is prevented, and the operability can be improved.<br>
By inserting the legitimate plate-like key 34 into the inner key case 38, the recognition magnets 52 recognize the identification magnets 55.    The magnet lock 50 is thereby unlocked, to allow pivoting of the pivoting member 41.    Accordingly, when the plate-like key 34 is further inserted, the engaging pin 41c of the pivoting member 41 escapes from the inclined groove 45a to proceed onto the flat surface 45b, and the inner key case 38 is moved to the insertion hold position B.    The first intermediate drive shaft 12 is thereby moved to the spline connection position with the second intermediate drive shaft 13 (see FIGS. 5 and 16) against the urging force of the restoring spring 14 by moving the restricting bar 39 backward along the first longitudinal slot 65a of the second intermediate drive shaft 13.<br>
When the insertion force is released at the insertion limit position of the inner key case 38 shown in FIG. 18, the inner key case 38 is slightly returned to the predetermined insertion hold position B by the urging force of the restoring spring 14, and is locked by the push-latch mechanism 56 as shown in FIG. 19.    At this stage, since the plate-like key 34 is locked in the inner key case 38 by the retaining means 60 as described above, the plate-like key 34 cannot be pulled out of the inner key case 38.<br>
Also, the restricting bar 39 comes to a position corresponding to the first lateral slot 65c of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 as shown in FIG. 5(B).    Thus, by pivoting the operation knob 11 from the power OFF position "OFF" to the power ON position "ON", the first intermediate drive shaft 12 and the second intermediate drive shaft 13 spline-connected to each other are pivoted together with the operation knob 11, and the first lateral slot 65c of the second intermediate drive shaft 13 receives the restricting bar 39 (see FIG. 6(B)).    At this point the second intermediate drive shaft 13 drives the follow shaft 20 connected to the power switch 3 to turn ON the power switch 3.    A user then can operate an unillustrated engine starter button to start an engine.<br>
 <br>
When the operation knob 11 is at the power ON position "ON", the movement of the restricting bar 39 in the axial direction of the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is blocked by the first lateral slot 65c.    Thus, the inner key case 38 supporting the restricting bar 39 is also fixed to the position.<br>
When the user pivots the operation knob 11 from the power ON position "ON" to the power OFF position "OFF" after finishing driving the two-wheeled motor vehicle, the power switch 3 is brought into an OFF state according to the operation opposite from the operation described above.    The engine operation can be thereby stopped.    At this point, since the first lateral slot 65c and the second lateral slot 65d are misaligned from each other in the longitudinal direction of the first longitudinal slot 65a, the restricting bar 39 escapes from the first lateral slot 65c to abut against the inner wall of the first longitudinal slot 65a, so that the restricting bar 39 is prevented from being moved to the second lateral slot 65d (see FIG. 5(B)).<br>
Subsequently, to lock the steering of the two-wheeled motor vehicle, firstly, the operation knob 11 is pushed at the power OFF position "OFF" as shown in FIG. 7.    The second intermediate drive shaft 13 moves the second lateral slot 65d to a position corresponding to the restricting bar 39 by the pushing operation.    By subsequently pivoting the operation knob 11 to the steering lock position "LOCK", the first and second intermediate drive shafts 12 and 13 are also pivoted.    Accordingly, when the first intermediate drive shaft 12 is pivoted to the steering lock position "LOCK", the follow shaft 20 is also pivoted to the steering lock position "LOCK" as shown in FIG. 8.    Thus, the crank 21 of the follow shaft 20 pushes the lock pin 30 via the operating plate 31 to fit the lock pin 30 into the lock hole 29 of the steering stem 28, so that the two-wheeled motor vehicle can be brought into a steering lock state.    Meanwhile, when the second intermediate drive shaft 13 is pivoted to the steering lock position "LOCK", the second lateral slot 65d guides the restricting bar 39 to the second longitudinal slot 65b as shown in FIG. 8(B).    The restricting bar 39 can thereby slide within the second longitudinal slot 65b, and the inner key case 38 supporting the restricting bar 39 can be also moved.    At this<br>
 <br>
time, by inserting the inner key case 38 again into the insertion limit position (see FIG. 20), the inner key case 38 is released from the locked state by the push-latch mechanism 56. The second intermediate drive shaft 13 can thereby return the inner key case 38 to the initial position A via the restricting bar 39 due to the urging force of the restoring spring 14. Also, since the retaining means 60 is in an unlocked state at the initial position A, the plateÂ¬like key 34 can be pulled out of the inner key case 38.<br>
When the operation knob 11 is at the power OFF position "OFF", the restricting bar 39 can slide within the first longitudinal slot 65a, and the inner key case 38 supporting the restricting bar 39 can be also moved.    Thus, by inserting the inner key case 38 to the insertion limit position, the inner key case 38 can be returned to the initial position A by the operation similar to that at the time of locking the steering, and the plate-like key 34 can be also pulled out of the inner key case 38.<br>
Accordingly, only the single plate-like key 34 in which the identification magnets 55 are incorporated is required and only the single key operation is required in the operating device locking system.    Thus, the structure can be simplified and the operability can be also improved.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment, and various design changes may be made without departing from the gist of the invention.    For example, the present invention may be also applied to a locking device for an operating device of a power switch, a steering lock device or the like of an automobile in addition to those of the two-wheeled motor vehicle.   A control device such as the power switch may be also directly turned ON/OFF in electrical or mechanical synchronization with the insertion hold position B and the initial position A of the inner key case 38.<br>
