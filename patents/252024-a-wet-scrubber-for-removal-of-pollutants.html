				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a wet scrubber for removal of Pollutants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
A pollution control device for removal of pollutants in the exhaust stream of a vehicle is known in the art. Such a known device had a complicated construction and was operable on lime water.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENITON<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a wet scrubber for filtration so suspended particulate matter and other pollutants entrained in an exhaust stream of a vehicle.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a wet scrubber for filtration of suspended particulate matter and other pollutants entrained in an exhaust stream of a vehicle, which is also a silencer.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a wet scrubber for filtration of suspended particulate matter and other pollutants entrained in an exhaust stream of a vehicle, which has a simple construction.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
At the outset of the description that follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention a wet scrubber, for removal of the pollutants entrained in an exhaust stream of a vehicle comprising:<br>
a)	a main tank having an inlet pipe (5) for receiving the exhaust stream of a<br>
vehicle and an outlet (12) for discharge of the cleansed stream,<br>
b)	a splashing shell (15) disposed within said tank (1) for receiving the exhaust stream<br>
c)	an inner shell (2) disposed within the said tank (1)<br>
d)	a water inlet (8) for introduction of water into said tank<br>
e)	an outlet (9) for removal of dirty water or slag containing the pollutants<br>
f)	a filtration member (7) disposed in the path of the exhaust stream.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention allows the exhaust smoke of gaseous substances suspended particulate matter to be dissolved while splashing on water and settle down in the form of slag. The left over in cleaned suspended particulate matter get scrubbed and filtered while passing through the filtration member for cleaner smoke, as well as the whole process controls the noise. The complete process works on the energy of the exhaust pressure.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from<br>
the ensuing description when read in conjuction with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig 1. Shows the wet scrubber of the present invention. <br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the wet scrubber of the present invention comprises a tank 1 having an extension inlet pipe 5 connected thereto. Extension inlet pipe has a proximal end 5a and a distal end 5b. Proximal end 5a is connected to an inlet pipe 11 for introduction of the gaseous exhaust stream of a vehicle into tank 1.<br>
A splashing shell 11 is disposed within tank 1, the distal end of extension pipe 5 terminating within shell 11. Fig. 1 shows that the distal end 5b terminates in an upward direction so that the exhaust stream from the vehicle strikes the upper wall of shell 15 and then flows downwardly into a water bath 10 disposed within tank 1. An inlet 8 is provided with tank 1 for introduction of water so as to maintain a water bath 10. Thus, the gaseous stream is redirected by splashing shell 15 into water bath 10. It would be apparent that the gaseous stream discharged from distal end could be directed directly in water bath 10. However, it is considered that the turbidity of the water bath would increase. In such an instance, the drainage of water through water outlet 9 would increase. Further, the efficiency of removal of the particulate suspended particles would reduce.<br>
The scrubber further comprises an inside shell 2 disposed within tank 1. An opening or a plurality of spaced openings 14 are provided with inside shell. Thus, the exhaust stream undergoes a scrubbing and cleansing action for removal of the suspended particulate material. The particulates are entrained in the water bath, which after use, forms into water slag and drained through outlet 9.<br>
The partially clean exhaust stream enters inside shell 2 and then flows into a top shell 3 through a filtration member comprising a packing 5 and a filter 7 for removal of the residual pollutants still entrained in the exhaust stream.<br>
The clean exhaust stream passes through a silencer or baffle 4 and then discharged through an outlet 12 and an extension pipe 17.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1.	A wet scrubber, for removal of the pollutants entrained in an exhaust<br>
stream of a vehicle comprising:<br>
a)	a main tank having an inlet pipe (5) for receiving the exhaust stream of a<br>
vehicle and an outlet (12) for discharge of the cleansed stream,<br>
b)	a splashing shell (15) disposed within said tank (1) for receiving the exhaust stream<br>
c)	an inner shell (2) disposed within the said tank (1)<br>
d)	a water inlet (8) for introduction of water into said tank<br>
e)	an outlet (9) for removal of dirty water or slag containing the pollutants<br>
f)	a filtration member (7) disposed in the path of the exhaust stream.<br>
2.	A wet scrubber, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said inlet pipe (5)<br>
extends upwardly into the said splashing shell (15).<br>
3.	A wet scrubber as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said inner shell (2) has an opening or a plurality of spaced openings (14) for receiving the partially clean exhaust stream.</td>
