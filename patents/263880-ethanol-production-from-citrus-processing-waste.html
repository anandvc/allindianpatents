				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INYENHON<br>
This invention relates to citrus waste processing and, more particularly, a process for the<br>
conversion of simple and complex carbohydrates contained in citrus waste into ethanol for use<br>
as bio-fuel and to yield other high-value byproducts.<br>
Currently, the amount of citrus waste, consisting primarily of peel, membranes, and seeds,<br>
which result from processing citrus fruit for juice, is an environmental problem. The problem<br>
exists particularly in areas where the bulk of citrus is grown to produce juice, such as in the<br>
State of Florida and the country of Brazil. For example, in 2003 Florida had approximately<br>
103 million citrus trees on 800,000 acres and produced 297 million boxes of citrus, 85% of<br>
which was processed into juice. The waste from such processing was approximately one-half<br>
of the citrus fruit, yielding approximately 5 million tons of wet waste, which reduces to 1.2<br>
million tons of dry waste.<br>
Traditionally, such waste has been converted into cattle feed, which currently does not have<br>
sufficient value to cover the production and transportation costs associated therewith. A<br>
further drawback of converting current waste into cattle feed is that the waste contains a high<br>
amount of d(+)-limonene (referred to simply as limonene). Volatilization of the limonene<br>
during the drying process causes air pollution to the extent that limonene vapors are exhausted<br>
into the atmosphere at the processing plants because it would require very expensive<br>
equipment to trap the limonene from the drier exhaust. Although citrus waste materials do<br>
create an environmental problem, these materials are rich in pectin and other polysaccharides<br>
that can be hydrolyzed into sugars for use in the production of ethanol.<br>
Currently ethanol is used as a bio-fuel that is mixed with gasoline to increase the octane rating<br>
and improve the environmental characteristics of gasoline. Although another gasoline octane<br>
enhancer referred to as MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) is also used, MTBE is<br>
controversial since it is believed to result in ground water pollution and is not biodegradable.<br>
Field corn (maize) is currently the primary feedstock for ethanol production in the USA. As<br>
the State of Florida has no cultivation of field corn, Florida must look to other sources for<br>
producing ethanol. The conversion of citrus processing waste into ethanol would reduce waste<br>
and provide a regional source of ethanol as a viable alternative octane enhancer to MTBE.<br>
2<br><br>
The conversion of citrus processing waste in 2003 of approximately 5 million tons could<br>
result in potentially 100 million gallons of ethanol.<br>
Unfortunately, one of the major problems that prevents processing citrus waste into ethanol is<br>
limonene. Limonene is a terpene-based liquid that is contained in citrus peel. Limonene<br>
provides a natural defense for the fruit against bacteria, viruses, molds, and other organisms.<br>
Accordingly, limonene protects the citrus waste from microbial buildup and fermentation by<br>
normal processes that would yield ethanol. It is also desirable to recover the limonene as a<br>
high value co-product. For efficient fermentation, limonene in the citrus waste must be<br>
reduced to a level below 3000 parts per million (preferred level below 1500 ppm). Thus, a<br>
need exists for processes that will decrease the amount of limonene in citrus processing waste<br>
in order to produce ethanol for use as a bio-fuel and other high value products, including<br>
cattle feed, limonene, five carbon sugars and galacturonic acid monomers and polymers.<br>
The new processes disclosed herein, for processing citrus waste to ethanol, utilize enzyme<br>
mixtures of pectinase, hemicellulases, cellulases and beta-glucosidases for efficient hydrolysis<br>
of the complex carbohydrates in citrus waste residue into simple sugars. Two different<br>
processes, steam stripping or centrifuging, can be used to lower the limonene content in the<br>
citrus waste to a sufficiently low level whereby fermentation of the waste can efficiently<br>
produce ethanol. The fermentation utilizes traditional ethanol producing yeast, E.coli strain<br>
KOI 1, or other bacteria or fungi, followed by distillation to recover ethanol. The solids<br>
residue remaining may still be utilized as a cattle feed product and will have higher protein<br>
content than the citrus-based cattle feed currently being produced. The residue after<br>
distillation may also be pressed and filtered with optional recovery of acetate, five carbon<br>
sugars, or galacturonic acid monomers/ polymers from the filtrate. Both jet cooking and<br>
centrifugation processes work more efficiently if the raw citrus processing waste is ground to<br>
a particle size of less than one inch (preferably less than one-half inch) using a hammer mill,<br>
grinding pump or similar shredding/chopping /grinding apparatus capable of handling and<br>
reducing said waste to the required size. A progressing cavity pump or similar pump (or<br>
conveyor) capable of pumping/moving raw or ground peel slurries with dry solids content up<br>
to thirty-five percent is then used to feed and mix the high viscosity mixture during the<br>
enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation.<br>
3<br><br>
Once the particle size of solids in the raw citrus waste is reduced to a size sufficient for<br>
further processing, then in a preferred processing embodiment the ground peel is first heated<br>
to a range of 60° - 240° Celsius (preferred range 90° - 19O°C) by steam injection, passage<br>
through a heated hollow shaft screw conveyer, or other direct or indirect heating device.<br>
Heating by steam injection or extrusion has the benefit of a simultaneous or sequential<br>
shearing and disintegration action which is beneficial to the hydrolysis process. The heating<br>
causes the limonene content to be decreased through evaporation and steam stripping. The<br>
limonene is then recovered by condensation of the removed steam and decanting (or<br>
centrifuging) the recovered liquid. The citrus waste solids slurry is then cooled and adjusted<br>
for pH, followed by simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation using an enzyme mixture and<br>
fermentation organisms such as yeast, E.coli strain KOI 1, or other bacteria or fungi, all while<br>
being continually mixed using high solids pumps or high solids mixers. After fermentation,<br>
the ethanol is separated by distillation and the resulting residue can then be pressed and dried<br>
for use as cattle feed or further processed with fermentation using E.coli KOI1, to produce<br>
more ethanol and acetate, or the unferrnented galacturonic acid monomers/polymers and five<br>
carbon sugars maybe recovered as additional products.<br>
In another embodiment of the process, the ground citrus peel is first directly hydrolyzed using<br>
an enzyme mixture (the enzymes are not significantly inhibited by the limonene) with<br>
controlled pH and temperature levels to maximize simple sugar content and then the limonene<br>
content is lowered using either a decanter (or tricanter) centrifuge or filtration device to<br>
remove the solids which are high in limonene content. Recovery of limonene from the solids<br>
cake or filtrate is accomplished by solvent extraction, or alternatively by steam stripping as<br>
described in the preferred embodiment described above. The liquid solution obtained from the<br>
centrifuge or filtration process is high in sugars and low in limonene content. The solution is<br>
adjusted for pH and temperature, and fermented using either traditional fermentation yeast,<br>
genetically engineered E. coli KOI 1, or other microorganisms to produce ethanol. The<br>
ethanol is separated by distillation. Following fermentation and distillation, the resulting<br>
residue may be pressed and dried for use as cattle feed with optional recovery of acetate, five<br>
carbon sugars, and galactui'onic acid monomers/polymers.<br>

None of the above patents discloses a process like the present invention for yielding ethanol<br>
and other byproducts from citrus processing waste.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a system and method of producing<br>
ethanol from citrus processing waste.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to increase the recovery of limonene from citrus<br>
waste in order to reduce pollution from limonene that results when raw citrus waste is<br>
converted into cattle feed by current drying processes.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to increase the recovery of limonene from citrus<br>
waste in order be sold as a high value byproduct.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide such a process that produces ethanol<br>
and byproducts for a lower cost than ethanol produced from corn.<br>
5<br><br>
An even further object of the present invention is to provide a process that yields other<br>
byproducts including five carbon sugars, galacturonic monomers/polymers, and a citrus based<br>
feed product for cattle and pets that has higher protein content and value than the citrus based<br>
cattle feed made from current processes.<br>
The present invention fulfills the above and other objects by providing a system and method<br>
for producing ethanol from citrus waste that reduces limonene in the citrus peel in order that<br>
fermentation can take place to yield ethanol. This system includes means for reducing the<br>
particle size of citrus waste solids in a citrus waste slurry to a predetermined size when<br>
necessary for processing, utilizing a hammer mill, grinding pump or similar<br>
shredding/chopping/grinding apparatus.<br>
Limonene is then removed using one of two techniques:<br>
1.	The citrus peel in the slurry is pre-hydrolyzed using a jet cooker, extruder, or other<br>
direct or indirect heating device, which pasteurizes the slurry and then it is passed through a<br>
flash tank or tube to remove the water vapor with limonene. Rapid cooling of the slurry can<br>
be achieved by vacuum cooling which gives the additional benefit of further limonene<br>
removal. However, other direct or indirect heat exchange methods can be used for cooling and<br>
stripping the slurry. pH is adjusted to suitable range for enzymes and microorganisms and<br>
hydrolysis, and potentially simultaneous fermentation, is then accomplished with enzymes<br>
with or without addition of ethanol producing microorganisms. Hydrolysis and/or<br>
fermentation in a slurry may be accomplished using an enzyme mixture circulated using high<br>
solids pumps or mixed using a high solids mixer or agitator.<br>
2.	The citrus waste is hydrolyzed using an enzyme mixture circulated using high solids<br>
pumps, or mixed using a high solids mixer or agitator, while pH and temperature are kept in a<br>
suitable range. Then the slurry can be centrifuged to remove the suspended solids which are<br>
high in limonene content, or alternatively or additionally heated by a jet cooker and a flash<br>
tube or tank used to remove limonene as in 1. above.<br>
6<br><br>
After the limonene has been reduced to a sufficiently low level, fermentation is accomplished<br>
in a fermentation tank using yeasts, E. coli/KOll, or other ethanol producing organisms such<br>
as fungi, E. coli, or Z. mobilis, and enzymes which may be mixed by circulation with high<br>
solids pumps or high solids mixers. Finally, ethanol can be distilled from the fermented citrus<br>
waste/beer. Optionally and additionally, the resulting residue can be further processed into<br>
solids and pet or cattle feed using a centrifuge and/or press and drying devices. Furthermore,<br>
the residue may also yield acetate, galacturonic acid monomers and polymers, and five carbon<br>
sugars.<br>
The pH of the citrus waste is controlled throughout the process in the range of pH 1 to 13<br>
(preferred range pH 2 to 11) by addition of acids/bases to optimize the hydrolysis by enzymes<br>
and/or cooking and to optimize fermentation outputs.<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become<br>
even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed<br>
description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>

With reference to the drawings, a preferred embodiment of the ethanol production process is<br>
shown in FIG. 1 in which separation of the limonene in citrus waste is accomplished via<br>
8<br><br>
heating and rapid cooling. FIG. 1 begins with ground citrus waste slurry 1, in which the citrus<br>
solids, consisting primarily of citrus peel, may be reduced to a pre-determined size for<br>
processing, generally less than one-half inch, by a hammer mill, grinding pump or similar<br>
shredding/chopping/grinding apparatus. The slurry pH may be adjusted to the range of pH 1<br>
to 13 (preferred pH 2 to 11) before being heated to atemperature between 60° - 240° Celsius<br>
(preferred range 90° - 190°C) by steam injection 2 or, alternatively by passing through a<br>
heated hollow shaft screw conveyer or similar direct or indirect heating device. Then the<br>
slurry is injected through a venturi into a flash tube or tank 4 where the water vapor<br>
containing limonene is separated 5. The removed vapor is then condensed into a decanter and<br>
limonene run off as a liquid from the top layer. A secondary vacuum stage 6 (or other cooling<br>
device) can further reduce limonene content and rapidly cool the slurry. Next the resulting<br>
mixture is pH adjusted 8 to pH 3 to 7 and then exposed to simultaneous hydrolysis and<br>
fermentation utilizing enzymes and ethanol-producing yeasts, E.coli strain KOI 1, or other<br>
ethanol producing organisms such as fungi, E. coli, or Z. mobilis, in a fermentation mixing<br>
tank 7. A high solids pump 9 re-circulates the mixture through a valve 10 and return line 11<br>
until sufficient fermentation has been achieved to produce significant ethanol concentration in<br>
the mixture. As an alternative, the mixture may be mixed with a high solids mixer/auger.<br>
Once sufficient ethanol concentration is attained the mixture proceeds to distillation, or<br>
equivalent separation technology, 12 in which ethanol 13 is separated from the mixture. The<br>
residue remaining after distillation can then be processed using a centrifuge 14 or filtration<br>
device to separate the solids from liquid. Thereafter the solids can be crushed and dried for<br>
use in making a cattle feed 15. The liquid can also be further fermented using E.coli KOI 1 to<br>
produce additional ethanol and acetate and/or processed to produce galacturonic acid<br>
monomer/polymers or other products 16.<br>
In FIG. 2 another embodiment of the ethanol production process is illustrated in which the<br>
ground citrus waste slurry is hydrolyzed using enzymes prior to limonene removal. The<br>
ground citrus waste slurry 21 is first hydrolyzed using an enzyme mixture 2 in order to<br>
maximize simple sugar content while pH is controlled 23 in the range of pH 2 to 11,<br>
according to enzymes used. A high solids pump 24 is used to re-circulate the mixture through<br>
the valve 25 and return line 26 until sufficient hydrolysis has taken place. A centrifuge or<br>
filter device 27 is used to separate solids rich in limonene 28 from the mixture, thereby<br>
lowering the limonene content of the remaining mixture. As use of a centrifuge can be<br>
9<br><br>
expensive, alternatively or additionally the mixture maybe heated as described in FIG. 1 and<br>
then the limonene removed by condensing the steam and removing high limonene content<br>
water. Next, the mixture which now has a high sugar and low limonene content is pH<br>
controlled 30 in the range pH 3 to 7 and is then fermented in a fermentation tank 29 using<br>
either traditional fermentation yeast, E.coli KOI 1, or other ethanol producing organism.<br>
Distillation, or an equivalent separation technology, 31 is then used to separate the ethanol 32<br>
from the mixture after fermentation. The residue remaining after fermentation can be exposed<br>
to a centrifuge or filtration device 33 to separate the solids, which can be pressed and dried<br>
and used as cattle feed 34. The separated liquid 35 can be used optionally to recover<br>
galacturonic acid monomers/polymers or to make additional etlianol and acetate through<br>
further fermentation using E.coli KOI 1 (or other organisms).<br>
FIG. 3 shows an example of an ethanol production process of the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention where after the initial simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation 41 (also<br>
known as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation - SSF) the ethanol 43, cattle feed<br>
44, and other potential products 45 are recovered before the liquid rich in galacturonic acid<br>
and 5 carbon sugars that are not fermentable by unmodified yeasts undergoes a secondary<br>
fermentation 46 by E.coli strain KOI 1, or other ethanol producing organisms such as fungi, E.<br>
coli, or Z. mobilis. The additional ethanol 48 is then recovered along with acetate and other<br>
potential products 49, and cattle feed 50. Thus, the present invention as described and<br>
illustrated teaches a system whereby citrus processing waste can be efficiently converted into<br>
ethanol and other byproducts. Although only a few embodiments of the present invention<br>
have been described in detail hereinabove, all improvements and modifications to this<br>
invention within the scope or equivalents of the claims are included as part of this invention.<br>

25.	The method of claim 16 further wherein: fermenting comprises initial fennentation by a<br>
non-GMO organism to recover etlianol and other products and a secondary fermentation by a<br>
GMO organism to produce additional ethanol and other products.<br>
26.	The method of claim 23 wherein the temperature is controlled using vacuum cooling.<br>
27.	The method of claim 24 wherein the pH of the mixture is controlled by adding either base<br>
or acid compounds as necessary.<br><br>
Processes for producing ethanol from citrus waste by reducing the concentration of limonene<br>
in citrus waste to allow fermentation are disclosed. In one embodiment a slurry of ground<br>
citrus waste is partially hydrolyzed by heating using a jet cooker and then injected into a flash<br>
tank to remove limonene. The heated citrus waste is then cooled, hydrolyzed with enzymes<br>
and fermented to ethanol. An alternative method of limonene removal uses enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis followed by centrifugation to separate sugar-containing liquid from residual citrus<br>
waste solids containing limonene. Sugars are fermented and ethanol is distilled from the<br>
fermented mixixu^eer. The remaining solids and liquids may be processed further to yield<br>
other byproducts. More particularly, the solids may be dried and pressed for use in cattle feed<br>
and the liquids may be further fermented or processed to yield additional ethanol, acetate,<br>
galacturonic acid monomers and polymers, five carbon sugars and other products.<br></td>
