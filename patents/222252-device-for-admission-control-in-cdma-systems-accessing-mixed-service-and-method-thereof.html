				<td>Field of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to prediction of uplink received total power and admission control in CDMA systems.<br>
Background of The Invention<br>
Mobile communication has been developed rapidly recently, and has become one important part of people's life in a very short period of several years. With the rapid development of Internet technology, people's desire of mobile Internet greatly impels the development of 3rd generation mobile communication system (IMT-2000). Comparing with 2nd generation mobile communication systems like GSM system, due to the demanding services of mobile online service, the type of services carried by the 3rd generation mobile communication system is no longer the simplified voice service but mixed services. For example, the type of services of WCDMA is defined in 4 classes according to quality of service (QoS): conversational class such as telephone service, IP communication service, etc., streaming class such as video data or audio data, interactive class such as online browsing, server accessing, data base visit, etc. and background class such as background E-mail distribution, downloading file, receiving detection report, etc. Because of the accessing of the mixed services, method for single service cannot be used for admission control and load control in the 3rd generation mobile communication system.<br>
GSM system basing on time-division multiplexing adopts hard capacity, of which the characterization parameter is channel numbers, i.e., time slot numbers, and new users cannot be accessed once all time slots are occupied.<br>
Although IS-95 system (2nd generation CDMA mobile communication system) is the same as GSM in the type of service, but completely different with GSM in technique. This system adopts Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique and its channels are distinguished by code sequences.<br><br>
The users operate in the same time in one frequency band. All main standards of WCDMA, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, etc. for the 3rd generation mobile communication (3G) system adopt CDMA technique, which is also a self-interference system with the same principle of IS-95. Each user interferes with others in the system, therefore the capacity of 3G system is closely related to the degree of interference. The capacity is soft, and closely relates to the QoS. For instance, in a certain QoS circumstance, the maximum number of users accessed in a single cell of WCDMA systems is 100, and basing on the number, accesses one more user is acceptable with the only defect of a little weaker voice quality. A typical result of simulation is that the capacity increases about 50% when the requirement for voice block error rate drops from 1% to 2%. Thus, the capacity characterization of 3G system not only simply adopts the number of channels, but also relates to the required QoS.<br>
Although main standards (such as: WCDMA, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, etc.) for 3G system adopt CDMA principle, the most important difference between 3G system and IS-95 system is different type of service carried, with mixed services focusing on both voice service and packet data service. Since 3G system carries mixed services with flexible rates, the characteristic of its services is more complicated than a single voice service, and each service has totally different behavior characteristic in the system, so the transmission technique and control method of 3G CDMA systems are much different from those of IS-95 system, and evaluation to the system capacity cannot simply adopt the number of channels. It has not been unified in current publications in determining capacity characterization parameters and the method of system admission control thereof, and even no consolidated standard has been enacted by 3GPP. System control method is developed by each company basing on the standard. Therefore, that is to say, the method of admission control for mixed services of 3G system is an art presently under competition.<br><br>
Because a CDMA system is also a self-interference system, interference increases when the number of users (mobile stations) in the system increases. In order to ensure the required QoS for all services, sending power should be continuously adjusted by the power control mechanism, and the sending power of each mobile station should be increased accompanying with the increase of the number of users in a same wireless environment, i.e., not only the sending power of the newly accessed current user is higher than that of the existing user with the same service in the system, but also the sending power of all accessed users in the system should be increased correspondingly, therefore the sending power of all users with the same service in the system should be increased, which results in an equal value of the power sent from each mobile station to the receiving end of the base station. The process of constant power increasing is a process of power ascending, reaching a new equilibrium point from one equilibrium point. Thus, when the users (mobile stations) in the system are increased to a certain number, it will result in a sudden power increase of avalanche. At the mean time, even if only one user is added, the required sending power of all users should be increased infinitely, which results in the total power received by the base station receiving end exceeding linear range of the liner power amplifier and the invalidation, thereby the system falls into paralysis or collapse. That is to say that the user cannot be accessed when the users (mobile stations) reach to a certain number. Therefore, adopting power as the measurement of system load and admission control is appropriate to CDMA systems.<br>
An US patent with the patent No. US5687171" device and method for allocating radio channels in a CDMA system" disclosed a method for measuring the strength of a signal received, calculating the margin allowed for signal strength, evaluating the required power for calling, and allocating a radio channel to a requesting mobile station when the required power is less than the margin. This method is typically an admission control method for single service and symmetrical service of 2nd<br><br>
generation, and only for measuring the strength of signals received by the uplink base station; in these methods, the power ascending capacity is not considered while calculating the required power for calling service, and also the admission specialty and priority level of non-real time service and mixed services, so that the diversity requirement for the mixed services of 3G system cannot be satisfied.<br>
For predicting the uplink received total power, it is easy for the single service but complicated for the mixed services, because in the single service, a curve reflecting the systematic load characteristic when accessing the single service, i.e. the curve of throughput versus uplink received power (uplink received power=sending power - path loss) can be obtained by the QoS requirement. If only this type of single service exists in the system, makes interpolation on the load characteristic curve in accordance with the throughput to gain the uplink received power value after accessing the service, thereby calculates the uplink received total power value according to the total number of users and compares the uplink received total power value with admission threshold so as to judge whether the current service can be admitted or not. However, for the mixed services, since the combination of services is various and the load characteristic curve of the system is unknown, it becomes difficult in predicting the uplink received total power of the system accessing current services.<br>
Summary of The Invention<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention provides a method for predicting uplink received total power in CDMA systems when accessing mixed service, which comprises: step 1, obtaining a characteristic relation curve of throughout e versus the uplink received total power in the case of only single service accessed for every kind of service, i.e. a systematic load characteristic curve for every kind of single service; step 2, obtaining current uplink received total power of a cell and serviceservice rate<br><br>

Furthermore, the present invention also provides a method of admission control in CDMA systems accessing mixed service, which comprises: step 1, obtaining a characteristic relation curve of throughout e versus the uplink received total power in the case that only single service accessed for every kind of service, i.e. a systematic load characteristic curve for every kind of single service; step 2, obtaining current uplink received total power of a cell and servicerate and signal to noise ratio of a new calling service;service rate step 3, calculating current converted service amount in the case of single service; step 4, calculating prediction value of the uplink received total power while adding 1 to the current converted service amount (showing accessing a new calling service); and step 5, comparing the prediction value of the uplink received total power with a preset threshold, admitting the new calling service if said prediction value is smaller than said threshold, or else rejecting it.<br>
Moreover, the present invention also provides a device for admission control in CDMA systems accessing mixed service, which comprises: a device obtaining a characteristic relation curve of a throughout of each service versus the uplink received total power in the case that only single service is received; a device calculating current converted service amount reaching the present uplink received total power in the case of single service of a new calling service; a device calculating prediction value of the uplink received total power while adding 1 to the current converted service amount; and a device comparing the prediction value of the uplink received total power with a preset threshold, admitting the new calling service if said prediction value is smaller<br><br>

Detailed Description of The Preferred Embodiments:<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig.1 shows a flow chart of the process of the method for predicting uplink received total power in CDMA systems accessing mixed service in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in fig. 1, at first at step 100, obtain a characteristic relation curve of a throughout of each service versus the uplink received total power in the case that only single service accessed. Then at step 105, obtain the present uplink received total power of a cell pm«as and the service rate R and signal to noise ratio Eb/Woof a new calling service. Further at step 110, calculate current converted service amount ijcurrent reaching the present uplink received total power Pmeas in the case of single service of the new calling service. And finally at step 115, calculate the prediction value of the uplink received total power while adding 1 to the current converted service amount (i.e. admitting the new calling service) as the prediction value of the uplink received total power. The above steps will be described in details accompanying with other drawings hereinafter.<br>
(Step 100)<br><br>
Fig.2 presents a detailed flow chart of the process of "obtaining a characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power" in the prediction method according to this embodiment. It will be understood by a person skilled in this field that there might be various methods to obtain the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power, for example statistic by actual measurement. The method of this embodiment is shown as fig. 2:<br>
(Step 201) At first, respectively set up the mathematic model for the number of users and the uplink received power in the case of accessing all the single services, i.e., set up a nonlinear equation (1) for the number of<br>
users/ and the uplink received power p/:<br>
^=101gaO°lfl' + A(i-VWolp
#o<br>
wherein p/ is the uplink received power value when the No.   /   service<br>
(user) is accessed, and for CDMA systems, the uplink received powers of all services will ascend after the access of the first service, and will reach to a new equilibrium point, which is realized by power control;<br>
PG is processing gain with the dimension of dB. For a WCDMA system,<br>
R(kbps) is service rate, 3840 kcps is chip rate, and the processing gain includes spreading gain and coding gain;<br>
Bg is background noise, usually -103.157dBm (27°C in 3.84MHz frequency band), and it can be different in different cells;<br>
A is a coefficient considering the adjacent cell is full, usually 1.55 (under the condition that the load of each cell is uniform distributed , and omni-directional antenna is adopted), i.e., the interference of the surrounding cell is 55% of the local cell.<br>
(Step 205) Afterwards, solve the equation (1) by iterative operation, and calculate the uplink received power corresponding to each single service<br><br>
while being accessed respectively. Construct the iterative function (1-1):<br>
rfVtPc-— )     dBm	(1-1)<br>
c<br>
wherein k is iterative times, and iterated initial value p(0) = B-(PG — -) ,<br>
N0<br>
and iterative converging is in the condition that the error value of each side of<br>
this equation should be smaller than 1 0" .<br>
The detail method of iterative operation is herein shown in fig. 3. At first, assign the iterated initial value, substitute the iterated initial value into equation (1-1) to calculate the current iterated new value, check the absolute<br>
value J = | p/**1) - p/W|of the difference between the current iterated consequence and the previous iterated consequence ( it is the iterated initial<br>
value when iteration just begins), and k is iterative times. Wherein when J is<br>
less than the set calculating precision, 1 0" can be chosen as the calculating<br>
precision. It means that the current calculation consequence is considered satisfying the condition to make the equation tenable when the difference is<br>
less than 1 0" , and the current iterated consequence is the solution of this<br>
equation, otherwise substitute the current iterated consequence into equation (1-1) to carry on the next iterative operation. If the iteration does not converge when exceeding the set maximum iterative times, it is considered no solution of this equation, i.e., adding one more user can result in a sudden power increase of avalanche for the system, thereby the system falls into collapse. The maximum iterative times can be set according to the computer's processing capability of the actual system, and 3000 times can be regarded as a reference value.<br>
(Step 210) Furthermore, calculate the corresponding uplink received total<br>
power Pijotai by equation (2):<br>
/»,_«* = 101g(10^ + /xlO°"")     dBm	(2)<br><br>
Substitute the consequence / and p, of step 205 into equation (2), then obtain the corresponding uplink received total power P;_totai of the system<br>
when accessing each number of /service. Variation of the uplink received total power of the system when accessing several single services respectively is shown in fig. 4.<br>
(Step 215) Then conduct least square fitting of the above discrete calculation consequences, and obtain mathematical illustration of the characteristic relation curve of the throughout of each service versus the uplink received total power in the case of single service is received. Orthogonal polynomial can be adopted as least square fitting, and the approximation function can be calculated in accordance with the following recursion:<br>
(*) = bk+(x- ak+l )qM (x) - (3Mqk+2 (*) ,   k = m, m - 1, A ,0<br>
*,(*) = ft*2(*) = 0	(3)<br>
,(*) =<br>
It should be noted that orthogonal least square fitting is adopted for easy degree ascending for the fitting polynomial. Since we cannot estimate the degree of the fitting polynomial beforehand, but only with coarse estimation, too higher degree polynomial fitting not only increases too much calculation, but also results in over-fitting, which is absolutely un-necessary. Thus, the commonly used method is to fit the polynomial with a lower degree, and check if the fitting error satisfies the requirement, or else ascend the degree. For ordinary least square fitting method, degree ascending will be a problem. Because it needs recalculation every time when the degree is ascended, but cannot use the calculated consequence in lower degree, which is a waste of calculation. However, orthogonal least square fitting can solve this problem. The calculation of a higher degree can be obtained by recursion from the lower degree. Therefore, there is not too much calculation for degree ascending, which particularly fits for fitting polynomial with an unknown<br><br>
degree.<br>
It can be known by calculation:<br>
(1) The degree of the fitting polynomial of the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power is 9 times, when solely accessing 8kbps service; the fitting parameters are shown in table 1; the fitting curve is shown in fig. 5A, and the fitting error is shown in fig. 5B. Table 1: Fitting Parameters For Skbps Service<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
(2) The degree of the fitting polynomial of the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power is 8 times, when solely accessing 12.2kbps service; the fitting parameters are shown in table 2; the fitting curve is shown in fig. 6A, and the fitting error is shown in fig. 6B. Table 2: Fitting Parameters For 12.2kbps Service<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
 (3) The degree of the fitting polynomial of the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power is 6 times, when solely accessing 64kbps service; the fitting parameters are shown in table 3; the fitting curve is shown in fig. 7A, and the fitting error is shown in fig. 7B. Table 3: Fitting Parameters For 64kbps Service<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
 (4) The degree of the fitting polynomial of the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power is 5 times, when solely accessing 144kbps service; the fitting parameters are shown in table 4; the fitting curve is shown in fig. 8A, and the fitting error is shown in fig. 8B. Table 4: Fitting Parameters For 144kbps Service<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
(5) When solely accessing 384kbps service, the maximum number of users is 3, so it does not need to fit the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power. The curve can be expressed by the broken line, as shown in equation (4).<br>
Throughput: x1 = 1 X384 kbps , x2 = 2X384 kbps, x3 = 3X384 kbps Total power: p1 =-102.280 dBm , p2=-1 00.890 dBm, p3=-98.115 dBm<br>

(4)<br><br>
(Step 105)<br>
After obtaining the characteristic relation curve of the throughout versus the uplink received total power in the case that only single service is received,<br>
we need to obtain the present measure uplink received total power p/neas of a cell and the service rate R and required signal to noise ratio EblN0 of a new<br>
calling service (step 105). As what is known by a person skilled in this field, these data can be obtained from the base station of the cell. For example, in 3GPP Standard the Public Measure Task specifies that the received total power of the base station of a cell is a required measure quantity, and herein we will not give further description.<br>
(Step 110)<br>
Next step, we need to calculate current converted service amount<br>
i_CUrrent reaching the present measure uplink received total power Pmeas in the case of single service of the new calling service. A method of one embodiment of the present invention is; combining equation 1 with equation 2 , so as to obtain a non-linear system of equations (5) after equation variation,<br>
then solving it if Pi_total - Pmeas •<br><br>
(5)<br>

Solve the non-linear system of equations by iterated operation, and Construct the following iterative function (5-1):<br><br>

(5-1)<br><br>
Select the iterated initial value:<br>
"/(0)=0<br>
Carry on iterated operation according to equation (5-1) and iterative converging is in the condition that the maximum error value of each side of<br>
this equation should be smaller than 10~5 . The current converted service amount ijcurrent (i_current might not be an integer) of a single service<br>
converted by the mixed service carried by the present system is obtained when iterative converging.<br>
(Step 115)<br>
At last, calculate prediction value of the uplink received total power while adding 1 to the current converted service amount (i.e., a new calling service is received). A method of one embodiment of the present invention is:<br>
At first, calculate the throughput while the new calling service is received:<br>
Then, in accordance with 7"c, make interpolation on the characteristic<br>
relation curve of said throughout versus the uplink received total power of the corresponding service obtained at the above step 100, and calculate the uplink received total power of the system whose power is ascended by the<br>
access of the new calling service (serial No.: f*1)<br>
Fig. 9 shows a flow chart of the process of the method of admission control in CDMA systems accessing mixed service in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In which the same steps are given the same serial No. as the former steps, and corresponding descriptions are omitted. As shown in fig. 9, after the above steps 100-115, proceed to step 120, and judge if the prediction value of the uplink received total power gained<br>
from step 115 is smaller than the preset admission control threshold Pth of the system. If so, proceed to step 130 and admit the new calling service (actuate the allocating subprocess of code resource); otherwise proceed to step 125 and reject the new calling service (perform call dropping or block treatment).<br>
As what is known by a person skilled in this field, 3G system is usually composed of User Equipment (UE), Wireless Access Network (UTRAN) and Core Network (CN), wherein the UTRAN is made up of Radio Network Subsystem (RNS) managed by a plurality of Radio Network Controller (RNS), and each RNS is made up of one RNC and multiple Node B. RNC is<br>
employed to allocate and control radio resource of Node B connected or related to RNC.<br>
The foregoing prediction method of the uplink received total power and admission control method of the present invention can be implemented in RNC in the form of hardware or software function module.<br>
The feasibility and advantages of the above-mentioned method, device and system of the present invention are verified by the following experiment data:<br>
Because we cannot assume the prediction value of the uplink received<br>
