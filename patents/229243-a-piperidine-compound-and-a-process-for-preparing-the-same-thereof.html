				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns piperidine compounds having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to the use of such derivatives as active therapeutic agents<br>
BACKGROUND &amp; PRIOR ART<br>
Pharmaceutically active N-(2-hydroxyprop-l-yl) piperidine derivatives are disclosed in WO 03/068743.<br>
Histamine is a basic amine, 2-(4-imidazoIyl)-ethylamine, and is formed from histidine by histidine decarboxylase. It is found in most tissues of the body, but is present in high concentrations in the lung, skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. At the cellular level inflammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils store large amounts of histamine, It is recognised that the degranulation of mast cells and basophils and the subsequent release of histamine is a fundamental mechanism responsible for the clinical manifestation of an allergic process. Histamine produces its actions by an effect on specific histamine G- protein coupled receptors, which are of three main types, H1, H2 and H3. Histamine H1 antagonists comprise the largest class of medications used in the treatment of patients with allergic disorders, for example rhinitis and urticaria. Antagonists of H1 are useful in controlling the allergic response by for example blocking the action of histamine on post- capillary venule smooth muscle, resulting in decreased vascular permeability, exudation and oedema. The antagonists also produce blockade of the actions of histamine on the H1 receptors on c-type nociceptive nerve fibres, resulting in decreased itching and sneezing.<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation and also play a role in the maturation of cells of the immune system. Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as we!1 :ns autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C, or a) and Cys-Cys (C- C, or P) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br><br>
The   C-X-C   chemokines   include   several   potent   chemoattractants   and   activators   of<br>
neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2),<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes, but<br>
not neutrophils, such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and<br>
MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxjns<br>
and the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1 a and 1 P (MIP-1 a and MIP-1 P).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies<br>
of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2,<br>
CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1,<br>
CXCR2,   CXCR3   and   CXCR4.   These   receptors   represent   good   targets   for   drug<br>
development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment<br>
of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br>
Viral infections are known to cause lung inflammation. It has been shown experimentally<br>
that the common cold increases mucosal output of eotaxin in the airways. Instillation of<br>
eotaxin into the nose can mimic some of the signs and symptoms of a common cold. (See,<br>
Greiff L et al Allergy (1999) 54 (11) 1204-8 [Experimental common cold increase mucosal<br>
output of eotaxin in atopic individuals] and Kawagnchi M et al Int.<br>
Arch. Allergy Immunol. (2000) 122 S 44 [Expressionof eotaxin by normal airway epithelial<br>
cells after virus A infection].)<br>

Method B: Potentiometric Method<br>
Two types of potentiometric titrations may be performed in order to determine a<br>
compound's pKa/pKgS; a purely aqueous titration (recommended for fairly water soluble<br>
compounds) and a cosolvent titration, where variable amounts of methanol are added to the<br>
sample in addition to ionic strength adjusted water (recommended for compounds which<br>
are not soluble in water). For the latter, a value for the compound's pK« in pure ionic<br>
strength adjusted water can be estimated by the Yasuda-Shedlovsky procedure. This<br>
involves measuring the apparent pK. of me compound at three known weight percentages<br>
of methanolrwater (transposed into reciprocals of the dielectric constants of the medium,<br>
I/ET) and men extrapolating to 0 wt% methanol (l/sl.282 x 10'3).<br>
The GLpK, instrument unit also houses two aqueous wash containers (containing<br>
distilled water), a waste beaker (to dispense extraneous solutions into) and a container<br>
holding pH 7.00 buffer solution for the electrode to be immersed in during periods between<br>
titrations. Each time a set of titrations is carried out, these solutions are replaced. Position<br>
1 in the autosampler contains a titration vessel containing pH 7.00 buffer solution (changed<br>
for each titration set). For each titration set to be run, position 2 houses a titration vessel<br>
into which ionic strength adjusted water is dispensed (typically 15.00 ml/). This in turn is<br>
adjusted to pH 1.80 with aqueous HC1 and then titrated to pH 12.20 by gradual addition of<br>
aqueous KOH. This is referred to as a blank titration and is employed by the pKaLogP<br>
software in order to calibrate the pH electrode and to standardise the HC1 solution, using<br>
the so-called four-plus parameter procedure. Periodically, (typically every 3 months, or<br>
when the titration solutions run low) the titration solutions are replaced and the KOH<br>
solution standardised against potassium hydrogen phthalate using a standardisation<br>
procedure within the GLpKaControl software. Between 1-2 nog of each sample must be<br>
accurately weighed out Samples arc placed in provided glass titration vessels. The weight<br>
of compound most be entered into me GLpKaControl software. Other parameters that<br>
need to be entered are; the molecular weight of the compound, assay type (aqueous,<br>
cosolvent), number of assays in the beaker (1 for aqueous titrations, 3 for cosolvent/mixed<br>
solvent titrations), formula (eg. X for a compound not present as a salt, or XHC1 for a<br>
compound introduced as a hydrochloride salt), expected number of pK«s (from known<br>
structure), minimum pH (1.80 for operational minimum of electrode), maximum pH (12.20<br>
for operational maximum of electrode), first assay direction (low to high pH recommended<br>
for bases, high to low pH recommended for acids), starting aqueous phase volume<br>
(minimum 8.00 mL, typically 15.00 mL for purely aqueous titrations and 9.00 mL for<br>
mixed solvent titrations), and pH step between points (ApHMUO units recommended). If<br>
mixed solvent titrations are carried out on a compound, then additional information needs<br>
to be entered; assay direction for second and third titrations (see first assay direction), and<br>
additional water volume for second and third assays (automatically calculated when using<br>
the cosolvent weight percentage tool).<br>
A number of samples (maximum 48) are placed in the autosampler and the<br>
pertinent information for each titration (weight of compound, molecular weight etc.)<br>
downloaded to the GLpK« instrument from the dedicated PC. The "run assays" option on<br>
the GLpKa instrument is selected and the titration run proceeds. At the end of the run, the<br>
titration data is uploaded to the PC and analysed using the pKaLOGP software. The first<br>
sample to be analysed is the blank titration. Curve fitting procedures are used to fit the<br>
measured data to a theoretical curve allowing the derivation of the exact concentration of<br>
the HCI solution, and also the values of various parameters (four-plus parameters) which<br>
characterise the behaviour of the electrode as a function of pH. These data are then used in<br>
the subsequent analysis of the other samples. The rest of the samples are analysed using<br>
further curve fitting procedures that extract the pKas of the compound by fitting the<br>
observed data to a theoretical curve. For cosolvent titrations the observed pKas from each<br>
sample at different percentages of methanol are analysed using the Yasuda-Shedlovsky • ,<br>
procedure in the pKaLOGP software which extraplotes the observed pKas to the true pKas<br>
in 100% aqueous solution.<br>
Method C: DPAS (Pro Probe Absorption Soectroscopvl Method<br>
This method determines pKas by measuring UV spectra of a compound as a<br>
function of pH. This method is most suitable for compounds where the ionising centre is<br>
situated close to an aromatic or conjugated system within the molecule such that a change<br>
in the extent of ionisation will lead to a change in the UV spectrum. Due to the good<br>
sensitivity of UV spectroscopy, this method is suitable for rather insoluble compounds.<br>
This method requires a blank titration to be run in just the same way as the<br>
potentiometric method. However, for the samples, two vials are required for each sample.<br>
Into one vial is placed a small amount of a DMSO solution of the compound (typically 50<br>
ul of a 1.5 mM solution) along with some phosphate buffer to give some pH stability<br>
during the titration (typically 100 uL of an aqueous solution prepared from 0.2 g potassium<br>
dihydrogen orthophosphate and 100 mL 0.1 M KC1 solution). The titrator will then add<br>
water (typically 10 mL) to this solution and then carry out a pH titration while collecting<br>
UV spectra at each pH. The second vial should contain and equivalent volume of neat<br>
DMSO and an equivalent volume of phosphate buffer. The titrator will then add an<br>
equivalent volume of water to this solution and take a UV spectrum of it to act as a<br>
reference (this is actually done before the pH titration of the corresponding sample<br>
solution).<br>
Again the first sample to be analysed is the blank titration which allows<br>
determination of the exact HC1 concentration and the values of four-phis parameters. The<br>
pKaUV software is then used to extract the pKas of the compound from the 3 dimensional<br>
data (absorbance, wavelength, pH) that was collected during the titration. The software<br>
uses a complex algorithm (target factor analysis) to extract the UV spectrum of each<br>
protonation state of the molecule as well as each pKa of the molecule from the raw 3<br>
dimensional data.<br>

were resuspended (5x106 ml'1) and loaded with SiM FLUO-3/AM + Pluronic F127<br>

O.SmM, glucose 5.5mM, Na2CO3 8.5mM, KC15mM, HEPES 20mM, CaCl2 L8mM, BSA<br>
0.1%, pH 7.4) for one hour at room temperature. After loading, cells were centrifuged at<br>
200g for 5mm and resuspended in LKS at 2.5xl06 ml"1. The cells were then transferred to<br>
96 well FLIPr plates (Poly-D-Lysine plates from Becton Dickinson pre-incubated with<br>
5iM fibronectin for two h) at 25nl/well. The plate was centrifuged at 200g for 5min and<br>
the cells were washed twice with LKS (200ul; room temperature).<br>
A compound of the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO and added to a final<br>
concentration of 0.1%(v/v) DMSO. Assays were initiated by the addition of an AM . n- <br>
concentration of eotaxin and the transient increase in fluo-3 fluorescence (1&amp; = 490nm and<br>
l&amp;a=520nm) monitored using a FUPR (Fhtorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular<br>
Devices, Sunnyvale, U.S.A.).<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists if the increase in<br>
fluorescence induced by eotaxin (a selective CCR3 agonist) was inhibited in a<br>
concentration dependent manner. The concentration of antagonist required to inhibit the<br>
fluorescence by 50% can be used to determine the ICso for the antagonist at the CCR3<br>

a concentration of a compound according to the Examples or solvent to the lower wells of<br>
the chemotaxis plate. The filter was then placed over the wells and 25 1 of eosinophil<br>
suspension were added to the top of the filter. The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37° C in<br>
a humidified incubator with a 95% air/5% COa atmosphere to allow chemotaxis.<br>
The medium, containing cells that had not migrated, was carefully aspirated from<br>
above the filter and discarded. The filter was washed once with phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) containing 5 mM EDTA to remove any adherent cells. Cells that had migrated<br>
through the filter were pelleted by centrifugation (SOOxg for 5 mins at room temperature)<br>
and the filter removed and the supernatant transferred to each well of a 96-well plate<br>
(Costar). The pelleted cells were lysedby the addition of 28 nl of PBS containing 0.5%<br>
Triton xlOO followed by two cycles of freeze/thawing. The cell lysate was then added to<br>
the supernatant. The number of eosinophils migrating was quantified according to the<br>
method of Strath et al., J. ImmunoL Methods, 1985, 83,209 by measuring eosinophil<br>
perpxidase activity in the supernatant ,<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists of eotaxin mediated<br>
human eosinophil chemotaxis if the concentration response to eotaxin was shifted tome<br>
right of the control curve. Measuring the concentration of eotaxin required to give 50%<br>
chemotaxis in the presence or absence of compounds enables the apparent affinity of the<br>
compounds at CCR3 to be calculated, or the assay can be used to determine activity of<br>
compounds at a set concentration of compound against a predifmed concentration of<br>
eotaxin.<br>
Example 50<br>
Guinea-pig isolated trachea<br>
(See for example, Harrison, R.W.S., Carswell, H. &amp; Young, J.M. (1984) European<br>
J. Pharmacol., 106,405-409.)<br>
Male albino Dunkm-Hartley guinea-pigs (250g) were killed by cervical dislocation<br>
and the whole trachea removed. After clearing the adherent connective tissue, the trachea<br>
was cut into six ring segments each three cartilage bands wide and then suspended in 20ml<br>
organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl<br>
117.6, NaH2P04 0.9, NaHCO3 25.0, MgS04 1.2, KC1 5.4, CaCl2 2.6 and glucose 11.1. The<br>
buffer was maintained at 37°C and gassed with 5% COa in oxygen. Indomethacin (2.8|iM)<br>
was added to the Krebs solution to prevent development of smooth muscle tone due to the<br>
synthesis of cyclo-oxygenase products. The tracheal rings were suspended between two<br>
parallel tungsten wire hooks, one attached to an Ormed beam isometric force transducer<br>
and the other to a stationary support in the organ bath. Changes in isometric force were<br>
recorded on 2-channel Sekonic fiat bed chart recorders.<br>
Experimental protocols<br>
At the beginning of each experiment a force of Ig was applied to the tissues and<br>
this was reinstated over a 60 minute equilibration period until a steady resting tone was<br>
achieved. Subsequently, a cumulative histamine concentration effect (E/[A]) curve was<br>
constructed at 0.5 logio unit increments, in each tissue. The tissues were men washed and<br>
approximately 30 minutes later, test compound or vehicle (20% DMSO) was added.<br>
Following an incubation period of 60 minutes a second E/[A] curve was performed to<br>
histamine.<br>
Contraction responses were recorded as a percentage of the first curve maximum.<br>
Data analysis<br>
Experimental E/[A] curve data were analysed for the purposes of estimating the<br>
potencies (piAso] values) of histamine in the absence and presence of the test compound.<br>
Affinity (pAa) values of test compounds were subsequently calculated using the following<br>
equation:<br>
where r = [A]so in presence of test compound/[A]so hi absence of antagonist and [B] is the<br>
concentration of test compound. Compounds of the Examples were found to be HI<br>
antagonists.<br>
Example 51<br>
Histamine HI receptor binding activity of compounds of the invention was<br>
assessed by competition displacement of InM [3H]-pyrilamine (Amersham, Bucks,<br>
.Product code TRKL 608, specific activity 30Ci/mmol) to 2jxg membranes prepared from<br>
recombinant CHO-K1 cells expressing the human HI receptor (Buroscreen SA, Brussels,<br>
Belgium, product code ES-390-M) in assay buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4 containing 2mM<br>
MgCla, 250mM sucrose and lOOmM NaCl) for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
