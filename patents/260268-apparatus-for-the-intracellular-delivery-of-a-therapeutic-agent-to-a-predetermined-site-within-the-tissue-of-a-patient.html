Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for delivery of prophylactic and<br>
therapeutic agents to patients, and more particularly, to an apparatus utilizing electrical fields to<br>
deliver such agents intracellularly in a safe, reproducible, efficacious, and cost effective manner.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Prophylactic and therapeutic agents have long been delivered to patients using various<br>
conventional routes of administration, such as topical, oral, intravenous, parenteral, and the like.<br>
Once administered to the patient by the selected route, the delivery of the agent to the tissue of<br>
interest and its beneficial interaction with the tissue is largely dependent on its inherent<br>
physicochemical factors, but may have been facilitated by, for example, selected components of<br>
the delivery composition such as carriers, adjuvants, buffers and excipients, and the like.<br>
More recently, the application of electrical fields has been shown to enhance the<br>
movement and uptake of macromolecules in living tissue. Application of such electrical fields in tissue relative to the administration of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent can have desirable<br>
effects on the tissue and/or the agent to be delivered. Specifically, techniques such as<br>
electroporation and iontophoresis have been utilized to enhance the delivery and/or uptake of a<br>
variety of agents in tissue. Such agents include pharmaceuticals, proteins, antibodies, and<br>
nucleic acids. Potential clinical applications of such techniques include the delivery of<br>
chemotherapeutic drugs and/or therapeutic genes in tumors, the delivery of DNA vaccines for<br>
prophylactic and therapeutic immunization, and the delivery of nucleic acid sequences encoding<br>
therapeutic proteins. <br>
Many devices have been described for the application of electrical fields in tissue for the<br>
purpose of enhancing agent delivery. The vast majority of these have focused on a means for<br>
effective application of the electrical fields within a target region of tissue. A variety of surface<br>
and penetrating electrode systems have been developed for generating the desired<br>
electrophysiological effects.<br>
In spite of the promise associated with electrically mediated agent delivery and the<br>
potential clinical applications of these techniques, progress has been hampered by the lack of an<br><br>
effective means to achieve the overall objective of efficient and reliable agent delivery using<br>
these techniques. Significant shortcomings of current systems include a complex application<br>
procedure, unwieldy device design, potential hazards for the user and patient and the inability to<br>
provide a cost effective means for administration.<br>
Given that safe, effective, consistent, and cost effective means for the administration of<br>
therapeutic agents are highly desirable, the development of improved application systems is well<br>
warranted. Such development should include a means for minimizing operator-associated<br>
variability and ensuring the safety of the user and the patient while providing for accommodating<br>
the differences in patient characteristics likely to be encountered during widespread clinical<br>
application of electrically mediated agent delivery.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an integrated apparatus enabling Electrically Mediated<br>
Therapeutic Agent Delivery (EMTAD) to be accomplished in a safe, consistent, and cost<br>
effective manner. The present invention allows effective intramuscular, intradermal, and/or<br>
subcutaneous administration of therapeutic or prophylactic agents such as nucleic acids, drugs,<br>
antibodies, and proteins.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for the delivery of an electrical<br>
field which facilitates the intracellular delivery of a therapeutic agent to a predetermined site<br>
within the tissue of a patient. In this aspect, the apparatus will comprise a plurality of<br>
penetrating electrodes arranged in a predetermined spatial relationship, each electrode with a<br>
cross sectional area contributing to the total cross sectional area of all electrodes, and structural<br>
means incorporating an inanimate source of energy operatively connected to the plurality of<br>
electrodes for deploying the electrodes, wherein the source of energy is sufficient to impart a<br>
force of at least 1000 pounds per square inch (0.7 kilograms per square millimeter) of total cross<br>
sectional area of all electrodes at the initiation of the deployment of the electrodes. The<br>
apparatus will also comprise means for generating an electrical field which facilitates the<br>
intracellular delivery of a therapeutic agent, which means is operatively connected to said<br>
electrodes at least in their deployed state.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides the apparatus with structural means configured<br>
to accept a fluid reservoir for containing a therapeutic agent, or with the fluid reservoir itself,<br>
where the reservoir is operatively connected to at least one injection orifice, and actuation means<br>
configured to transmit the therapeutic agent through the orifice to the predetermined site within<br>
the tissue of the patient.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include such apparatus configured to accept replaceable<br>
therapeutic agent fluid reservoir subassemblies, electrode subassemblies, and a combination<br>
thereof. Also included are include means for priming the automated mechanisms incorporated in<br>
the applicator upon insertion of the cartridge, identifying the model or type of cartridge that has<br>
been inserted, and protecting the user and patient from accidental injury associated with the<br>
usage of the apparatus.<br>
Additional aspects of the invention include such apparatus configured to improve the<br>
functionality and ergonomics of the Applicator (i.e. the user interface) in a number of ways. The<br>
inanimate source of energy can be positioned alongside the fluid reservoir, so as to reduce the<br><br>
overall length of the apparatus, and improve its ease of use. The deployment of the electrodes<br>
and administration of the therapeutic agent, as well as the creation of the electrical field, can be<br>
implemented with a single activation trigger. Further, safety interlocks and shields can be<br>
included to reduce the risk of accidental discharge and inadvertent contact with the electrodes<br>
and fluid orifice.<br>
Further improvements can be included in the design of the fluid reservoir, such as the<br>
utilization of a vial, such as a glass, polycarbonate, polyethylene, etc. vial, as a means of utilizing<br>
a dry, e.g. lyophilized, therapeutic agent and a fluid supply, and allowing the separate<br>
components to be mixed just prior to use.<br>
Yet additional improvements can be included to render the apparatus more readily<br>
adaptable to a wide range of patients, e.g. patients with widely differing body mass indices<br>
indicating a range of the thickness of patients' subcutaneous adipose layers, or the need to adjust<br>
the depth of the predetermined site in the patient. Such improvements can include, for example,<br>
a depth gauge for adjusting the depth of the penetration of the electrodes and orifice, or the use<br>
of different length and/or diameter electrodes and orifice structures, e.g. different length and<br>
gauge of syringe needles.<br>

Additional aspects of the invention include such apparatus configured to improve the<br>
functionality and ergonomics of the Applicator (i.e. the user interface) in a number of ways. The<br>
inanimate source of energy can be positioned alongside the. fluid reservoir, so as to reduce the<br><br>

a depth gauge for adjusting the depth of the penetration of the electrodes and orifice, or the use<br>
of different length and/or diameter electrodes and orifice structures, e.g. different length and<br>

In general terms, the present invention will preferably provide an apparatus for the<br>
delivery of a therapeutic agent and electrical fields to a predetermined site within the skin and/or<br>
skeletal muscle of a patient in a manner that is effective, reproducible, and safe for both the<br>
operator and the patient. One embodiment of the apparatus comprises a single use subassembly<br>
"cartridge" and a hand-held "applicator". The single use sub-assembly integrates a reservoir for<br>
containing the agent of interest, at least one orifice through which the agent is delivered to the<br>
patient, and two or more electrodes capable of propagating electrical fields within the tissue.<br>
The hand-held applicator interfaces with the single use cartridge and incorporates automated<br>
mechanisms to (1) deploy the electrodes to the target tissue site, (2) position the orifice relative<br>
to the target tissue site, (3) transfer the agent from the reservoir through the orifice and into the<br>
target tissue site, and (4) relay electrical signals from a suitable pulse generator to the electrodes.<br>
Although certain distinctions can be drawn between agents which are administered to<br>
patients for prophylactic purposes and agents which are administered for therapeutic purposes, in<br>
the context of the present invention such agents are considered to be substantially equivalent and<br>
will be referred to herein as therapeutic agents, unless otherwise indicated.<br><br>
Apparatus Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides an improved apparatus for safe, efficacious and<br>
reproducible, transcutaneous intramuscular (IM) delivery of therapeutic agents with Electrically<br>
Mediated Therapeutic Agent Delivery (EMTAD).<br>
A specific embodiment of an integrated unit for transcutaneous IM applications is<br>
illustrated in Figures 1-5. The apparatus consists of a main unit (applicator) 100 and a separable<br>
single use sub-assembly (cartridge) 200. The cartridge is configured to include a reservoir to<br>
contain the agent to be administered prior to delivery. The reservoir will be designed and<br>
constructed to maintain the agent in a stable environment and prevent contamination. The<br>
reservoir is operatively connected to an orifice through which the agent is administered into the<br>
patient. Most commonly, the reservoir and orifice are comprised of a syringe connected to a<br>
hollow injection needle 300. The cartridge encloses the electrode array and includes integral<br>
automatic protection.against unwanted contact with the electrodes and/or the orifice/injection<br>
needle (i.e. "stick protection").<br>
The applicator 100 incorporates a spring mechanism for automatic insertion of the<br>
electrode array and the injection needle into the target-tissue. The applicator also includes a<br>
separate spring mechanism for automated controlled therapeutic agent injection through the<br>
incorporated syringe. The applicator incorporates a means to allow electrical communication<br>
with a suitable pulse generation device capable of controlling the treatment application sequence.<br>
Most commonly electrical communication is achieved through a conductive cable and connector.<br>
A trigger 101 on the applicator is utilized to initiate the treatment. Finally a system for<br>
identifying the inserted cartridge and setting the treatment parameters based on the cartridge is<br>
provided in the applicator.<br>
Integration of agent/syringe with cartridge<br>
In previously disclosed devices of this nature, a means for administration of the<br>
therapeutic agent comprising a reservoir and at least one orifice through which the agent is<br>
administered have been described. In clinical practice of the previously disclosed invention it is<br>
desirable to integrate the means for administration of the therapeutic agent (reservoir and orifice)<br>
with the cartridge. Integrating the administration means with the cartridge can simplify the<br>
procedure by reducing apparatus handling. Reducing apparatus handling can also improve<br>
operator and patient safety by eliminating needle stick hazards and dosage errors. Integration<br><br>
also improves the accuracy of the predetermined spatial relationship between the agent delivery<br>
orifice and the electrode array.<br>
There are several suitable embodiments of integrating the means of agent administration<br>
with the single use cartridge. The cartridge can be configured to accept a syringe and needle as<br>
the reservoir and orifice. It is desirable that once the syringe has been integrated with the<br>
cartridge that the integration is permanent. Permanent integration will prevent disassociation of<br>
the syringe and cartridge and reduce the possibility of needle stick injuries. The syringe can be<br>
an off-the-shelf syringe that is loaded with the agent prior to the agent administration procedure.<br>
Utilization of an off-the-shelf syringe allows one cartridge configuration to deliver numerous<br>
agent and dosage combinations. Additionally off-the-shelf syringes are readily available and<br>
cost effective. The syringe can alternatively be pre-filled with an agent and packaged with the<br>
cartridge. Utilization of a pre-filled syringe reduces the possibility for dosage errors.<br>
Additionally a pre-filled syringe does not require a plunger extending from the proximal end of<br>
the syringe to manually load the agent. Elimination of the plunger extension allows for a smaller<br>
apparatus that uses less material and is more ergonomic.<br>
Another embodiment of integrating the reservoir and orifice with the cartridge is to<br>
incorporate the reservoir into the cartridge design thus eliminating the need for a separate<br>
syringe. It is preferable that the cartridge be constructed of an inert material to prevent reaction<br>
with the agent. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, glass, polycarbonate and<br>
polyethylene.<br>
It is desirable to store certain agents in a lyophilized state to improve shelf life. Such<br>
agents are mixed with a diluent prior to administration. A dual chamber reservoir where the<br>
lyophilized agent and the diluent are stored in the separate chambers can also be utilized for such<br>
agents. Prior to treatment the separation between the chambers is removed or broken to allow<br>
mixing of the agent and diluent. One suitable separation between the chambers is a stopcock<br>
valve that is manually opened. Another suitable separation is a thin film or a check valve that<br>
can be opened when adequate pressure is applied to the diluent chamber. Such a dual chamber<br>
reservoir can be incorporated into the cartridge.<br>
A specific embodiment for integrating the means for agent administration with the<br>
cartridge is herein described. The specific embodiment utilizes an off-the-shelf syringe and<br>
needle 300 for the administration reservoir and orifice. The cartridge 200 is configured to accept<br>
the syringe and locate the needle orifice in a predetermined spatial relationship with the electrode<br><br>
array. Furthermore the cartridge is configured with snap tabs 224 that lock the syringe in place<br>
once it is inserted into the cartridge. <br>
Drive Mechanisms<br>
There are several mechanisms that are suitable as inanimate sources of energy to insert<br>
the electrodes and injection needle through the skin and into the targeted treatment tissue and<br>
also to inject the agent, through the needle. A compressed gas powered mechanism is one such<br>
apparatus. Electro/mechanical mechanisms such as solenoids, linear motors and lead screws are<br>
also acceptable. However the preferred approach for transcutaneous electrode and injection<br>
needle insertion is the spring-based mechanism.<br>
Electrode insertion mechanisms require sufficient force to rapidly penetrate the skin and<br>
implant the electrodes into the muscle. Rapid insertion can reduce tenting of the skin at the<br>
insertion site and thereby reduce deflection of the electrode or needle. Electrode deflection may<br>
distort the electrode array and effect treatment efficacy and patient safety. Needle distortion may<br>
effect co-localization of the agent and electrical fields. So it is desirable to insert the electrodes<br>
and needle rapidly to minimize deflection. Additionally rapid electrode/needle insertion reduces<br>
patientdiscomfort. The energy storage and discharge characteristics of spring-based<br>
mechanisms are well suited to enable rapid deployment of electrodes and injection needles into<br>
tissue with minimal distortion.<br>
Insertion and injection mechanisms for transcutaneous applications also require sufficient<br>
linear motion (throw) to implant the electrodes to the target treatment depth and to inject the<br>
prescribed volume / dose of agent. Spring mechanisms are preferred since they can achieve<br>
adequate linear motion in a small and lightweight package. Additionally springs mechanisms do<br>
not require electrical or gas connections, they do not require consumables such as compressed<br>
gas canisters and finally they are cost effective.<br>
Automatic/Passive Spring Priming<br>
Although their functional characteristics and cost effectiveness make them preferable<br>
overall, spring mechanisms require priming. Energy is be imparted to and stored in the spring<br>
prior to actuating the treatment sequence. Previously disclosed devices of this nature require that<br>
the user actively perform a separate step to prime the spring mechanism prior to the use of the device. The disclosed invention includes means to automatically or passively prime the spring<br><br>
mechanism upon insertion of the cartridge 200 into the applicator 100. It is desirable that the<br>
priming of the spring mechanism ("spring priming") be accomplished in conjunction with the<br>
insertion of the cartridge 200 into the applicator 100. In addition to simplifying the procedure,<br>
automated/passive spring priming also eliminates the problematic failure mode of not priming<br>
the spring. A variety of energized mechanisms can be employed in the apparatus to accomplish<br>
automated spring priming. These mechanisms comprise an energy source, a suitable trigger, and<br>
a means to transfer energy from the energy source to the spring(s). Insertion of the cartridge into<br>
the applicator activates the trigger leading to the transfer of energy from the energy source to the<br>
spring(s). Sources of energy/mechanisms to achieve this function include but are not limited to<br>
compressed gas, solenoids and electrical motor-based mechanisms.<br>
A preferred method and apparatus is to utilize the insertion and attachment of the<br>
cartridge 200 to the applicator 100 as a means to passively prime the spring mechanisms during cartridge insertion into the applicator - "cartridge priming". Utilizing the cartridge priming<br>
method provides the benefits of the described invention while eliminating the need for the<br>
additional priming mechanism required for automated spring priming. This simplifies the<br>
apparatus and reduces cost without sacrificing ease-of-use and safety.<br>
In embodiments where the cartridge is utilized to prime spring drive mechanisms, there<br>
will be means to apply force to the injection drive mechanism through the cartridge without<br>
depressing the spring plunger and ejecting the agent from the syringe. Additionally, since the<br>
operator applies force to the cartridge to prime the spring mechanisms,it is desirable that the<br>
apparatus include means to prevent accidental deployment of electrodes and/or needles during<br>
the insertion of the cartridge into the applicator to prevent needle stick injuries. Moreover it is<br>
desirable that the means for stick prevention also prevent damage and/or contamination to the<br>
electrodes and needle during priming. Finally, in such an embodiment there is a risk that the<br>
operator may release the cartridge before completing priming. This may result in the stored<br>
spring energy ejecting the cartridge from the applicator causing injury and/or damage to the<br>
apparatus. Therefore it is desirable to prevent accidental ejection of the cartridge,<br>
One specific embodiment is presented in Figures 1-5 for achieving the invention of<br>
cartridge priming. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the specific mechanisms used to<br>
achieve cartridge priming are a matter of convenience and that the use of alternative mechanisms<br>
for achieving cartridge priming does not depart from the scope of the described invention. In the<br>
specific embodiment described herein, the cartridge 200 and applicator 100 are configured so<br><br>
that the cartridge 200 can only be inserted into the applicator 100 in a specific priming<br>
orientation. In the priming orientation, at least one cantilevered extension 202 of the cartridge<br>
engages the injection drive mechanism 110 and imparts the priming force to the mechanism<br>
while preventing the mechanism from contacting the syringe plunger 302. This specific<br>
embodiment provides stick prevention andprotects the electrodes/needle from<br>
damage/contamination during priming by maintaining the electrodes/needle safely retracted and<br>
locked within the cartridge. Snap tabs 222 incorporated into the cartridge prevent the electrode<br>
hub 220 from moving axially relative to the cartridge collar 210 and thereby maintain the<br>
electrodes/needle safely retracted within the cartridge. Further stick and contamination<br>
protection is provided by a cap 230 over the distal end of the cartridge. The cap 230 is removed<br>
prior to treatment application. Preferably, the cap is constructed of puncture resistant material<br>
and the interface between the cap and the cartridge is designed to minimize the risk of<br>
contamination during handling. The electrode hub 220 engages the insertion drive mechanism<br>
120 and transfers the priming force applied to the cartridge collar 210 to the insertion<br>
mechanism. To prevent accidental ejection of the cartridge during priming, this specific<br>
embodiment incorporates one-way leaf-spring latches 130 in the applicator that allow the<br>
cartridge to be inserted in the priming orientation but prevent it from being removed or ejected in<br>
that orientation. A ratchet mechanism is another suitable means to prevent accidental ejection of<br>
the cartridge. When the cartridge is completely inserted into the applicator, two spring-actuated<br>
latches 112,122 capture the insertion and injection spring mechanisms and maintain them in<br>
their primed and energized state until they are actuated during treatment. A solenoid actuator<br>
114,124 is attached to each latch 112,122 and when activated displaces the latch and releases<br>
the spring mechanism 110,120.<br>
Upon completion of the cartridge insertion and spring mechanism priming, the cartridge<br>
is twisted ¼ turn to complete attachment of the cartridge to the applicator. In this attached<br>
orientation the cantilevered extension 202 disengages from the injection drive mechanism 110<br>
freeing the mechanism to act upon the syringe plunger 302 when the injection mechanism is<br>
released. Additionally in this attached orientation the applicator depresses the tabs 222 and frees<br>
the electrode hub to move axially relative to the cartridge, so the insertion mechanism can<br>
advance the electrodes and needle when the mechanism is released.<br><br>
Designs Enabling Improved User Interface Factors<br>
In the practice of the invention, ergonomics and human factors play a significant role in<br>
consistently providing safe and effective agent administration. The size and shape of the<br>
apparatus used for agent administration (the user interface) can affect the operator's ability to<br>
effectively deliver the agent to the target tissue site. It is desirable that the design of the<br>
apparatus facilitate accurate positioning of the apparatus in the proper location and orientation.<br>
Improper positioning of the apparatus can affect both the safety and efficacy of the treatment.<br>
In addition to the human factors associated with the user, the size and shape of the device<br>
can also influence patient acceptance. A device can be threatening to patients, particularly if it is<br>
especially large, has a form suggestive of a weapon, or is otherwise intimidating. Therefore it is<br>
desirable that the device has a form factor that is both ergonomic and non-threatening.<br>
In previously disclosed devices of this nature, the drive mechanisms have been arranged co-<br>
linearly and in series with the cartridge. This results in a long and unwieldy device. The<br>
described invention utilizes one or more drive mechanisms arranged in parallel with the cartridge<br>
and the line of action of the electrodes and syringe. The parallel drive mechanisms can be<br>
arranged co-linearly or in an offset fashion. This parallel arrangement yields a more compact,<br>
ergonomic and non-threatening apparatus.<br>
One specific embodiment employing offset parallel spring mechanisms is described in<br>
Figures 1-5, however, the invention can be adapted to achieve a desirable form factor utilizing<br>
other spring and drive mechanisms. For instance the spring may surround the electrode array or<br>
syringe. Additionally the mechanism may utilize mechanical advantage to increase linear<br>
motion or force,<br>
In the specific embodiment illustrated in Figures 1-5, the insertion and injection spring<br>
mechanisms are positioned within the applicator parallel and offset from the cartridge. The<br>
Force and motion of the spring mechanisms is transferred to the cartridge through drive arms<br>
116,126 that extend through the applicator and interface with the cartridge.<br>
Cartridge Identification<br>
In order to be well suited for use in clinical applications, an EMTAD device should<br>
accommodate the range of doses that may be prescribed for a given agent. When employing<br>
EMTAD, the "dose" of the agent is determined by the volume and concentration administered,<br>
the electrode array configuration and the electrical field parameters applied to the tissue<br><br>
(including waveform, voltage, duration, frequency, and number of pulses). In order to assure<br>
that the prescribed "dose" is applied to a given patient, the proper electrical parameters will be<br>
conveyed to the pulse generator. Although this can be accomplished through user input, such a<br>
system would carry a risk that a user error could result in a hazardous operating condition.<br>
Therefore it is desirable to provide an automated means for dosage recognition that minimizes<br>
the risk of a hazardous operating condition.<br>
Although there are several automated means for dosage recognition a preferable method<br>
is accomplished in conjunction with the insertion of the cartridge into the applicator. In such an<br>
embodiment the electrical signal parameters partially determine dose are determined by the<br>
cartridge that includes the other two dose parameters (agent and electrode array). It is also<br>
desirable that the treatment sequence cannot be initiated until the electrical signal parameters are<br>
set. This assures safe and proper attachment of the cartridge to the applicator. In previously<br>
disclosed devices of this nature, programmable integrated circuits and other relatively expensive<br>
means have been described. In order to be well suited for commercial application the means for<br>
cartridge identification / electrical signal parameter recognition should be cost effective. In<br>
particular the components of the identification system and the associated manufacturing<br>
processes that are part of the single-use cartridge should be cost effective.<br>
One skilled, in the art will recognize that there are several suitable means for cartridge<br>
identification / electrical signal recognition. Suitable means include optical bar code identification and wireless radio frequency identification. In the case of bar code identification<br>
the bar code would be affixed or imprinted onto the cartridge and the reader would be integrated<br>
into the applicator. In the case of radio frequency identification the transponder would be<br>
integrated into the cartridge and the receiver would be included in the applicator. Preferably the<br>
receiver would be tuned only to receive the radio frequency signal when the cartridge was<br>
properly attached to the applicator. Another suitable method is to utilize a series of discrete<br>
switches in the applicator that may be closed when the cartridge is inserted. The pattern of open<br>
and closed switches would determine the electrical signal parameters. The switches could be<br>
electro/mechanical, opto/electro or any other suitable switch.<br>
For example one embodiment utilizing three open contact pairs in the applicator 100 is<br>
illustrated. Conductive tape is affixed to the cartridge 200 to close the contact pairs when the<br>
cartridge is attached to the applicator. This 3-bit system will identify seven electrical signal<br>
parameter settings plus three open contact pairs will indicate when a cartridge is not attached.<br><br>
In addition to defining the administration dose, the described invention would also facilitate the<br>
use of a single application system for delivery of multiple classes of agents, which require<br>
different electrical conditions to achieve effective delivery.<br>
Adjustable Treatment Depth<br>
Efficacious, consistent, and safe application of EMTAD for intramuscular delivery relies<br>
in part on treating a consistent volume of muscle tissue. However, there is a significant variation<br>
between patients and treatment sites in the subcutaneous fat pad thickness that is penetrated to<br>
access the targeted muscle tissue. In one study, (Poland GA, et al. JAMA. 1997 Jun 4;<br>
277(21): 1709-11) a range of deltoid fat pad thickness from 3.7mm to 35.6mm is reported. So for<br>
a given electrode array size, the volume of muscle tissue affected will vary depending on the fat<br>
pad thickness. Additionally the thickness of tissue between the skin and the bone also vary<br>
significantly between patients and between treatment sites. So an electrode/needle length<br>
appropriate to treat a large patient may impact bone during insertion into a small patient. Electrode contact with bone could cause injury to the patient and/or it could distort the electrode<br>
array and effect safety and efficacy of the treatment. It is therefore desirable to provide a means<br>
for adjusting the depth of electrode/needle penetration based on the treatment site and patient<br>
anatomy.<br>
In the present invention, an adjustable ring 240 over the distal tip of the present invention<br>
modifies the electrode/needle penetration depth. The ring can be adjusted axially relative to the<br>
cartridge 200 tip so that the length of the ring that extends beyond the distal tip of the apparatus<br>
reduces the length of electrode/needle that penetrate into the patient. The specific embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figures 1-5 utilizes a diamond shaped ring that snaps into discrete axial positions.<br>
To modify its position, the major axis of the diamond shaped ring is compressed causing the<br>
minor axis to expand and release the ring from the cartridge. Another suitable embodiment is a<br>
ring that is threaded onto the cartridge tip and can be adjusted by threading the ring back and<br>
forth on the cartridge. This embodiment allows for a continuous number of depth adjustment<br>
positions.<br>
Automatic/Passive Release of Trigger Safety<br>
Inadvertent release of the primed insertion and injection spring mechanisms can result in<br>
injury, loss of therapeutic agent and/or damage to the device. It is therefore desirable to provide<br><br>
a safely system to prevent accidental release of the spring mechanisms. It is preferable that such<br>
a safety system-prevent accidental release of the spring mechanisms due to external forces such<br>
vibration and impact. Additionally, the operator may inadvertently activate the treatment<br>
sequence when handling the device, so it is also preferable that the safety system prevent<br>
activation of the treatment sequence unless the device is properly applied to the treatment site.<br>
Proper placement at the treatment site can also affect treatment efficacy. For instance, the device<br>
is desirably applied to the treatment site with adequate force to assure that the electrodes/needle<br>
penetrate into the tissue to the full-prescribed depth. Preferably the safety system is<br>
automatically and passively deactivated when the device is applied to the treatment site with<br>
adequate force. Automatic and passive disablement of the safety system does not require a<br>
separate operator step. In addition to simplifying the procedure, automated/passive safety<br>
disablement also eliminates the possible failure mode of not deactivating the safety system.<br>
To ensure that the electrodes/needle penetrate into the tissue to the full-prescribed depth,<br>
the minimum force with which the device is applied to the treatment site (the "application<br>
force") will exceed the force necessary to insert the electrodes/needle (the "electrode insertion<br>
force"). The electrode insertion force is dependent upon several variables, which are disclosed<br>
in detail herein below. By way of example, a typical electrode insertion force may be 2.5 pounds<br>
(11.1 Newtons), therefore, the rninimum application force would be 2.5 pounds (11.1 Newtons).<br>
Preferably, a margin of safety would be added to the insertion force so the application force<br>
would be between 3.5 and 5.0 pounds (15.6 — 22.2 Newtons). Preferably the required<br>
application force will not exceed a force that the operator can comfortably apply to the treatment<br>
site. 	<br>
A preferred embodiment of the disclosed safety system is herein described. Within the<br>
applicator 100 at least one mechanical stop 140 physically prevents the latches 112,122 from<br>
disengaging from the insertion 120 and injection 110 spring mechanisms. The connection<br>
between the applicator trigger and the pulse generator is maintained open by an electronic switch<br>
142 thereby preventing accidental activation of the treatment sequence. The internal<br>
mechanisms of the applicator float axially within an outer housing 102 and are maintained in an<br>
extended position by a spring 144 acting between the internal applicator and the external<br>
housing. The spring is equal to the preferred application force. When the apparatus is applied to<br>
the treatment site with adequate pressure to overcome the spring force, the internal applicator is<br>
repositioned within the outer housing 102. In this position the safety systems are disabled. The<br><br>
stop 140 is repositioned relative to the latches and no longer prevents the latches from<br>
disengaging from the insertion and injection spring mechanisms. Furthermore the electronic<br>
switch 142 contacts the outer housing and is closed allowing the trigger to communicate with the<br>
pulse generator and initiate the treatment sequence,<br>
Electrode Array Insertion Spring Force/Rate<br>
Electrode insertion mechanisms require sufficient force to rapidly penetrate the skin and<br>
implant the electrodes into the muscle. Rapid insertion can reduce tenting of the skin at the<br>
insertion site and thereby reduce deflection of the electrode or needle. Electrode deflection may<br>
distort the electrode array and effect treatment efficacy and patient safety. Needle distortion may<br>
effect co-localization of the agent and electrical fields. So it is desirable to insert the electrodes<br>
and needle rapidly to minimize deflection. Additionally rapid electrode/needle insertion reduces<br>
patient discomfort. The energy storage and discharge characteristics of spring-based<br>
mechanisms are well suited to enable rapid deployment of electrodes and injection needles into<br>
tissue with minimal distortion.<br>
Several variables influence the spring force necessary for rapid intramuscular electrode<br>
insertion including electrode diameter, number of electrodes, spacing between electrodes and<br>
electrode tip geometry. For intramuscular EMTAD, common electrode diameters range from<br>
0.25 mm to 1.50 mm and typical electrode array configurations contain from 2 to 7 electrodes.<br>
The force required to insert the electrode arrays within these range's is proportional to both the<br>
electrode diameter and to the number of electrodes. For instance increasing the electrode<br>
diameter and/or increasing the number of electrodes results in an increase of the minimum<br>
required insertion force. Electrode spacing on the other hand is inversely proportional to the<br>
spacing between electrodes. Due to the interaction of tissue that is displaced as the electrode is<br>
inserted smaller electrode spacing result in higher insertion force. Typical EMTAD apparatus,<br>
incorporating arrays of penetrating electrodes utilize an intra-electrode spacing at least 10 times<br>
greater than the diameter of the electrodes comprising the array and more commonly 15-20 times .<br>
greater. Within this range there is little interaction of displaced tissue and therefore electrode<br>
spacing has minimal effect on the insertion force. Cutting electrode tip geometry is preferred to<br>
minimize insertion force. Blunt and dilating tip geometry requires increased insertion force.<br>
Experiments are carried out to determine minimum spring force/rate necessary for rapid<br>
percutaneous intramuscular electrode implantation. A selection of electrode arrays appropriate<br><br>
for intramuscular application of EMTAD and with cutting tip electrodes is evaluated. Each<br>
electrode array is implanted into a porcine model and the minimum spring force necessary to<br>
rapidly penetrate the cutaneous tissue and implant the electrode array without significant<br>
distortion is determined. Because of the force exerted by a spring decreases as the energy is<br>
released from the spring two results are given. The first is the force at the beginning of the<br>
spring stroke and represents the minimum force necessary to penetrate the cutaneous tissue. The<br>
second is the force at the end of the spring stroke and represents the minimum force necessary to<br>
implant the electrode array through the sub cutaneous and muscle tissue. Because the forces are<br>
dependent upon the electrode diameter and the number of electrodes the results are given as a<br>
ratio of force to total cross-sectional area of the electrodes in the array. The results indicate that<br>
a minimum of 1000 pounds of force per square inch ( 0.7 kilograms per square millimeter) of<br>
cross-sectional area of electrodes at the beginning of the implant stroke and a minimum of 500<br>
pounds of force per square inch (0.35 kilograms per square millimeter) of cross-sectional area of<br>
electrodes at the end of the implant stroke is desirable to implant the electrodes. In order to<br>
assure consistent and reliable deployment of the electrodes an initial implant force of at least<br>
2000 pounds per square inch (1.4 kilograms per square millimeter) of electrode cross sectional<br>
area and a terminal implant force of at least 750 pounds of force per square inch (0.5 kilograms<br>
per square millimeter) of cross-sectional area of electrodes is preferred. .<br>
By way of example, an array comprised of 4 electrodes, each with a diameter of 0.02<br>
inches would have a total cross-sectional area of approximately 0.00125 square inches (0.8<br>
square millimeters). Thus a mechanism for deployment of the example array would require a<br>
minimum force of 1.25 pounds (5.5 Newtons) to achieve insertion and more preferably a force of<br>
at least 2.50 pounds (11 Newtons).<br>
In embodiments where the spring mechanisms are manually primed, it is preferable to<br>
limit the force of the springs so that the operator can comfortably prime the springs. A preferred<br>
limit for spring priming is less than 15 pounds force (67 Newtons). For embodiments where<br>
each spring mechanism is primed separately the maximum force for a spring is 15 pounds (67<br>
Newtons). However for those embodiments where the insertion and injection spring<br>
mechanisms are primed simultaneously the combined spring force preferably will not exceed 15<br>
pounds (67 Newtons).<br><br>
Agent Administration Spring Force/Rate<br>
Several variables affect the force necessary to administer the therapeutic agent. These variables include, agent viscosity, cross-sectional area of the syringe, needle gauge, cross-<br>
sectional area of orifice(s), and tissue density. For parameters typical of intramuscular EMTAD<br>
the minimum spring force necessary to administer the therapeutic agent is 0.25 pounds (1.1<br>
Newtons). Preferably the injection spring force is between 1 and 10 pounds (4.5 - 45 Newtons).<br>
 Although the functional characteristics and cost effectiveness of the injection spring<br>
mechanism makes it preferable overall, the impact of the drive mechanism onto the syringe<br>
plunger can create a "water hammer" effect. The force wave generated from the impact can<br>
travel through the agent within the syringe and result in damage to the syringe or needle. In<br>
particular, standard plastic needle hubs may crack or split causing the agent to leak before it is<br>
completely administered. It is therefore desirable to damp the impact energy of the drive<br>
mechanism without affecting the force/rate of agent injection.<br>
There are several means to damp the impact energy of the drive mechanism. One such<br>
means is to position an energy absorbing material 118 between the syringe plunger 302 and drive<br>
mechanism 116. Appropriate energy absorbing materials include but are not limited to<br>
elastomers such as silicone and polyurethane and closed-cell foams. Another suitable means to<br>
absorb the impact is gas/fluid dampening to slow the rate of the drive mechanism. Such an<br>
apparatus requires that at least a portion of the injection drive mechanism displace a gas or fluid<br>
through a small bleed hole in order to move forward. Preferably the gas is air and the bleed hole<br>
is tuned so that the dampening or is less than the dampening produced from administering the<br>
agent through the injection needle. In such a case, the gas dampening will only affect the rate of<br>
the drive mechanism until it contacts the syringe at which point the dampening produced from<br>
administering the agent through the injection needle will be the limiting factor affecting agent<br>
administration.<br>
Automatic/Passive Stick Prevention<br>
Post treatment the electrodes and injection needle present a hazard for needle sticks and<br>
transfer of blood borne pathogens. Therefore it is desirable that the apparatus includes integral<br>
stick protection. Moreover it is desirable that the stick protection is both automatic and passive.<br>
Automatic stick protection will eliminate possible injury when manually deploying the stick protection and it also eliminates the possible failure mode of not deploying the stick protection.<br><br>
Preferably, upon activation the stick protection includes a means for locking in place to prevent<br>
possible someone from defeating the stick protection once it has deployed.<br>
One preferred embodiment of an integral automatic locking stick protection is presented.<br>
However one skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments that can achieve the same<br>
objective. The specific embodiment herein described utilizes a stick shield 250 integral to the<br>
cartridge that automatically extends over the electrodes/needle as they are removed from the<br>
patient. A compression spring 252 within the cartridge is positioned proximal to the stick shield<br>
between the stick shield and the electrode hub 220. As the electrode hub advances distally<br>
during electrode/needle insertion the spring is compressed. When the electrodes/needle are<br>
removed post treatment from the patient, the spring extends and extends the stick shield distally<br>
over the electrodes and needle. As the shield is completely extended over the electrodes and<br>
needle cantilevered tabs on the stick shield snap into corresponding grooves in the collar 210<br>
. thereby locking the shield in the extended position.<br>
Single Use ;<br>
Users may attempt to reuse the single use cartridge to save costs or to apply an off label<br>
agent. Reusing the cartridge may affect the safety and efficacy of the treatment. For instance,<br>
coatings on the electrodes that may be utilized to assure biocompatibility may not withstand<br>
multiple uses so the treatment may produce a toxic result in the patient. Additionally, sterility of<br>
a reused device cannot be assured. It is therefore desirable to include features in the apparatus<br>
that prevent reuse.<br>
 The apparatus herein described includes three features that prevent reuse. The stick<br>
shield 250 locks in an extended position preventing the electrodes and needle from being<br>
inserted into the patient. The syringe is permanently attached to the cartridge when it is inserted,<br>
so the syringe cannot be detached to reload it with the agent. Finally, after electrode insertion<br>
the cartridge hub/collar configuration is fixed with the hub inserted into the collar. In this<br>
configuration the cartridge will not prime the insertion and injection spring mechanisms. Also in<br>
this configuration the cartridge identification contacts in the applicator will not communicate<br>
with the cartridge so the control system will not recognize the cartridge and will prevent,<br>
treatment.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are other suitable means for preventing<br>
reuse. One such method is to incorporate a fuse into the cartridge and apply a signal from the<br><br>
pulse generator that blows the fuse at the end of the treatment. Another such means is to identify<br>
each cartridge with a unique serial number that is read by the applicator. The pulse generator<br>
would store the serial numbers and not apply treatments through cartridges whose serial numbers<br>
have already been read and stored.<br>
Manufacturability<br>
In order to be well suited for commercial application, the manufacturing costs of a single-<br>
use cartridge should be as low as possible. In addition, when applying EMTAD multiple<br>
electrode array configurations may be required to deliver a range of doses prescribed for a given<br>
agent. One method of reducing manufacturing costs while producing multiple array<br>
configurations is to utilize many of the same components in the multiple cartridge<br>
configurations. This approach will reduce costs including but not limited to tooling costs,<br>
inventory costs, quality control costs and handling costs.<br>
. In the specific embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, the electrode array configuration is<br>
modified by changing the geometry of only the electrodes 260. A bend 262 near the distal end of<br>
the electrode changes the relative position of the penetrating end of the electrodes within the<br>
cartridge and thus changes the array configuration. The cartridge components are designed to<br>
accept multiple electrode geometries and therefore can be utilized in multiple electrode array<br>
configurations. Additionally the cartridge components have been designed to snap together and<br>
utilize the bend in the electrode to securely capture the electrodes between the cartridge<br>
components. This approach further reduces fabrication costs by elimination more costly joining<br>
techniques such as adhesive joints, solvent bonding, insert molding and ultrasonic welding.<br>
