				<td>The invention relates to stabilizer systems encompassing at least one perfluoroalkanesulphonate salt and at least one or more compounds from the groups consisting of the indoles, ureas, alkanolamines and aminouracils, which are suitable for stabilizing halogen-containing polymers.<br>
A halogen-containing polymer, such as PVC, may be stabilized by any of a large number of additives. Compounds of lead, of barium, and of cadmium are particularly well suited to this purpose, but are nowadays controversial for environmental reasons or because of their heavy metal content (cf. "Plastics Additives Handbook", H. Zweifel, Carl Hanser Verlag, 5th Edition, 2001, pp. 427-483, and "Kunststoff Handbuch PVC" [Plastics Handbook PVC], Volume 2/1, W. Becker and D. Braun, Carl Hanser Verlag, 2nd Edition, 1985, pp. 531-538; and Kirk-Othmer: "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 4th Edition, 1994, Vol. 12, -Heat Stabilizers, pp. 1071-1091).<br>
There is therefore a continuing search for effective stabilizers and stabilizer systems which are free from lead, barium and cadmium.<br>
It has now been found that systems made from at least one or more compounds from the groups consisting of the indoles, ureas, alkanolamines and aminouracils and from at least one perfluoroalkanesulphonate salt, are particularly highly suitable for stabilizing chlorine-containing polymers, in particular PVC.<br>
The invention accordingly provides stabilizer systems comprising at least<br>
a) one perfluoroalkanesulphonate salt and<br><br><br>
b) at least one or more indoles and/or ureas and/or alkanolamines and/or aminouracils<br>

N-methyl-, -butyl-, -octyl-, -lauryl- or<br>
-stearyl-N'-methyl-, -butyl-, -octyl-, -lauryl- or<br>
-stearylcyanoacetylurea.<br>
The perfluoroalkanesulphonate salts of the formula (RfSO3)nM are known to the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The underlying acids, and also salts, are described in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Vol 11, pp 558-564 (1994) .<br>
Examples are those of the formula (CmF2m+1S03) nM where M is Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sn, Zn, Al, La or Ce. The index n is correspondingly the valency of M: 1, 2 or 3 . The perfluoroalkanesulphonate salts here may be used in various familiar supply forms; e.g. as a salt or solution in water or in an organic solvent, or absorbed onto a carrier material, such as PVC, Ca silicate, zeolites or hydrotalcites. Examples are perfluoro-alkanesulphonate salts which have been converted to complexes or solutions using alcohols (polyols, cyclodextrins) or using ether alcohols or using ester alcohols or using crown ethers.<br>
Trifuoromethanesulphonic acid ("triflic acid") and its salts ("triflates") are reviewed in Chem. Rev. 77, 69-90 (1977), for example.<br>
It is preferable to use sodium triflate or potassium triflate.<br>
The invention also provides combinations of the stabilizer systems encompassing at least one perfluoroalkanesulphonate salt and at least one or more compounds from the groups consisting of the compounds of the general formula (I) or (II) or (III) or (IV) with at least one or more other conventional additives or stabilizers. Preference is given to polyols and/or disaccharide alcohols, glycidyl compounds, hydrotalcites, zeolites (alkali metal aluminosilicates and alkaline earth metal aluminosilicates), fillers, metal soaps, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds, such as oxides and hydroxides, lubricants, plasticizers, phosphites, hydroxycarboxylates,<br><br>
pigments, epoxidized fatty esters and other epoxy compounds, antioxidants, UV absorbers and light stabilizers, optical brighteners and blowing agents. Particular preference is given to epoxidized soya oils, alkaline earth metal or aluminium soaps and phosphites.<br>
Particular preference is given to those components which are suitable for producing physiologically non-hazardous products.<br>
Also included are the possible reaction products of the components used.<br>
Examples of additional components of this type are listed and explained at a later stage below (cf. "Handbook of PVC Formulating" by E. J. Wickson, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1993 and Synoptic Document No. 7, Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) - EU).<br>
Polyols and disaccharida alcohols<br>

bis(trimethylolethane), trimethylolpropane, sugars,<br>
sugar alcohols.<br>
Of these, preference is given to pentaerythritol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, sorbitol and the disaccharide<br>
alcohols such as Malbit, lactitol and cellobiitol, and<br>

It is also possible to use polyol syrups, such as<br>
sorbitol syrup, mannitol syrup and maltitol syrup.<br>
Examples of the amounts of the polyols used are from<br>
0.01 to 20 parts by weight, advantageously from 0.1 to<br>

It is preferable to use glycidyl compounds having two functional groups. However, it is also possible in principle to use glycidyl compounds having one, three or more functional groups.<br>
Use is predominantly made of diglycidyl compounds having aromatic groups.<br>
The amounts used of the terminal epoxy compounds are preferably at least 0.1 part, preferably from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, advantageously from 1 to 30 parts by weight and in particular from 1 to 25 parts, based on 100 parts by weight of PVC.<br>

the skilled worker, e.g. from the patents DE 3 843 581,<br>
US 4,000,100, EP 0 062 813 and WO 93/20135.<br>
Compounds from the hydrotalcite series may be described<br>

Very particular preference  is given  to Na  zeolite A and Na   zeolite   P.<br>
The  hydrotalcites  and/or  zeolites  may be  used  in amounts  of,   for  example,   0.1   to  20  parts  by weight, expediently  0.1   to   10  parts  by weight  and  in particular 0.1  to  5  parts  by weight,   based on  100  parts  by weight of  halogen-containing polymer.<br>
Fillers<br><br>

Preference is given to chalk (HANDBOOK OF PVC FORMULATING, E. J. Wickson, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1993, pp. 393 - 449) and reinforcing agents (TASCHENBUCH der Kunststoffadditive [Plastics Additives Handbook], R. Gachter &amp; H. Muller, Carl Hanser, 1990, pp. 549 -615) .<br>
The fillers may be used in amounts of preferably at least one part by weight, for example 5 to 200 parts by weight, expediently 10 to 150 parts by weight and in particular from 15 to 100 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of PVC.<br>
Metal soaps<br>
Metal soaps are primarily metal carboxylates, preferably of relatively long-chain carboxylic acids. Well-known examples of these are stearates, oleates, palmitates, ricinolates, hydroxystearates, dihydroxy-stearates and laurates, and also oleates and salts of relatively short-chain aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, hexanoic acid, sorbic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, anthranilic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, benzole acid, salicylic acid, phthalic acids, hemirnellitic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid.<br>
Metals which should be mentioned are: Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Al, La, Ce and rare earth metals. Use is frequently made of so-called synergistic mixtures, such as barium/zinc stabilizers, magnesium/zinc stabilizers, calcium/zinc stabilizers or calcium/magnesium/zinc stabilizers. The metal soaps may<br><br>
be used either alone or in mixtures. An overview of common metal soaps is found in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. A16 (1985), pp. 361 et seq.<br>
The metal soaps or mixtures of these may be used in amounts of, for example, 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, expediently 0.01 to 8 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of PVC.<br>
Alkali metal and alkaline earth metal compounds For the purposes of the present invention, these are mainly the carboxylates of the acids described above, but also corresponding oxides or, respectively, hydroxides or carbonates. Mixtures of these with organic acids are also possible. Examples are LiOH, NaOH, KOH, CaO, Ca(OH)2, MgO, Mg(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, Al(OH)3, CaCO3 and MgC03 (and also basic carbonates, such as magnesia alba and huntite), and also fatty-acid salts of Na and of K. In the case of alkaline earth carboxylates and Zn carboxylates it is also possible to use adducts of these with MO or M(OH)2 (M = Ca, Mg, Sr or Zn), so-called "overbased" compounds. In addition to the stabilizers according to the invention it is preferable to use alkali metal carboxylates, alkaline earth metal carboxylates and/or aluminium carboxylates.<br>
Lubricants<br>
Examples of possible lubricants are: fatty acids, fatty alcohols, montan wax, fatty acid esters, PE waxes, amide waxes, chloroparaffins, glycerol esters and alkaline earth metal soaps, and fatty ketones, and also the lubricants, or combinations of the lubricants, listed in EP 0 259 783. Stearic acid, stearic esters and calcium stearate are preferred.<br><br>
Plasticizers<br>
Examples of organic plasticizers are those from the following groups:<br>
A)	Phthalates: examples of these plasticizers are<br>
dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, dihexyl, di-2-ethylhexyl,<br>
di-n-octyl, diisooctyl, diisononyl, diisodecyl,<br>
diisotridecyl, dicyclohexyl, dimethyleye1ohexyl,<br>

Examples of the chlorine-containing polymers to be stabilized are:<br>
polymers of vinyl chloride, of vinylidene chloride, vinyl resins whose structure contains vinyl chloride units, such as copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl esters of aliphatic acids, in particular vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride with esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and with acrylonitrile, copolymers of vinyl chloride with diene compounds and with unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides of these, such as copolymers of vinyl chloride with diethyl maleate, diethyl fumarate or maleic anhydride, postchlorinated polymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride with unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and others, such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde, vinyl methyl ketone, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether and the like; polymers of vinylidene chloride and copolymers of the same with vinyl chloride and with other polymerizable compounds; polymers of vinyl chloroacetate and of dichlorodivinyl ether; chlorinated polymers of vinyl acetate, chlorinated polymeric esters of acrylic acid and of alpha-substituted acrylic acid; polymers of chlorinated styrenes, such as dichlorostyrene; chlorinated rubbers; chlorinated polymers of ethylene; polymers and postchlorinated polymers of chlorobutadiene and copolymers of these with vinyl chloride, chlorinated natural or synthetic rubbers, and also mixtures of the polymers mentioned with themselves or with other polymerizable compounds. For the purposes of this invention, PVC includes copolymers with polymerizable compounds, such as<br><br>
acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate or ABS, where these may be suspension polymers, bulk polymers or else emulsion polymers. Preference is given to a PVC homopolymer, also in combination with polyacrylates.<br>
Other possible polymers are graft polymers of PVC with EVA, ABS or MBS. Other preferred substrates are mixtures of the abovementioned homo- and copolymers, in particular vinyl chloride homopolymers, with other thermoplastic or/and elastomeric polymers, in particular blends with ABS, MBS, NBR, SAN, EVA, CPE, MBAS, PMA, PMMA, EPDM or with polylactones, in particular from the group consisting of ABS, NBR, NAR, SAN and EVA. The abbreviations used for the copolymers are familiar to the skilled worker and have the following meanings: ABS: acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; SAN: styrene-acrylonitrile; NBR: acrylonitrile-butadiene; NAR: acrylonitrile-acrylate; EVA: ethylene-vinyl acetate. Other possible polymers are in particular styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers based on acrylate (ASA). A preferred component in this context is a polymer composition which comprises, as components (i) and (ii), a mixture of 25-75% by weight of PVC and 75-25% by weight of the copolymers mentioned. Components of particular importance are compositions made from (i) 100 parts by weight of PVC and (ii) 0-300 parts by weight of ABS and/or SAN-modified ABS and 0-80 parts by weight of the copolymers NBR, NAR and/or EVA, but in particular EVA.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention it is also possible to stabilize in particular recycled materials of chlorine-containing polymers, specifically the polymers described in more detail above, which have been degraded by processing, use or storage. Recycled material from PVC is particularly preferred.<br><br>
The compounds which may be used concomitantly according to the invention, and also the chlorine-containing polymers, are well known to the skilled worker and are described in detail in "Kunststoffadditive" ["Plastics Additives"], R. Gachter/H. Muller, Carl Hanser Verlag, 3rd and 4th Ed., 1989 and 2001; in DE 197 41 778 and in EP 967 245, which are incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>
The stabilization according to the invention is particularly advantageous for rigid PVC formulations for transparent and non-transparent applications, as are common in pipes, profiles and sheets. For transparent applications, use is preferably made of compounds of the formula (I), (II), (III) or (IVb) which have a melting point below about 190Â°C. The stabilization is also useful for semirigid and flexible formulations, and also in plastisols. The stabilization requires no heavy metal compounds (Sn stabilizers, Pb stabilizers, Cd stabilizers, Zn stabilizers) and is particularly highly suitable for producing physiologically acceptable consumer products from PVC, including products for medical use.<br>
The stabilizer systems may advantageously be incorporated by the following methods: as emulsion or dispersion; as a dry mixture during the mixing of added components or polymer mixtures; by direct addition into the processing apparatus (e.g. calender, mixer, kneader, extruder or the; like) or as a solution or melt or, respectively, as flakes or pellets in a dust-free form as one-pack.<br>
The PVC stabilized according to the invention, which is also provided by the invention, may be prepared in a manner known per se, by using equipment known per se, such as the abovementioned processing apparatus, to mix the stabilizer system of the invention and, if desired,<br><br>
other additives, with the PVC. The stabilizers here may be added individually or in a mixture, or else in the form of what are known as masterbatches.<br>
The PVC stabilized as in the present invention may be brought into the desired shape in a known manner. Examples of processes of this type are grinding, calendering, extruding, injection moulding and spinning, and also extrusion blowmoulding. The stabilized PVC may also be processed to give foams.<br>
A PVC stabilized according to the invention is, particularly suitable for example, for hollow articles (bottles), packaging films (thermoformed films), blown films, pipes, foams, heavy profiles (window frames), translucent-wall profiles, construction profiles, sidings, fittings, office sheeting and apparatus housings (computers, household devices). Preference is given to rigid PVC 'foam moldings and PVC pipes, for example for drinking water or wastewater, pressure pipes, gas pipes, cable-duct pipes and cable-protection pipes, pipes for industrial pipelines, drainpipes, outflow pipes, gutter pipes and drainage pipes.<br>
The PVC stabilized according to the invention is also particularly suitable for semirigid and flexible formulations, in particular in the form of flexible formulations for wire sheathing, cable insulation, flooring, wallpapers, motor vehicle components, flexible films, injection mouldings or hoses, these being particularly preferred. The inventive PVC in the form of semirigid formulations is particularly suitable for decorative films, foams, agricultural films, hoses, sealing profiles and office films. Examples of the use of the inventive PVC as plastisol are synthetic leather, flooring, textile coatings, wallpapers, coil-coating materials and underbody protection for motor vehicles.<br>
