				<td>FLOWABLE PARTICULATES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates  to flowable particulates and compositions comprising such particulates; and processes for making and using such particulates and products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Flowability is a desirable characteristic for most products as it provides an ease of dispensability that can permit accurate, controlled dosing. Solid products do not provide the steady rate of pouring or discharge of product in a narrow bulk flow stream, especially when the width of the stream is narrow compared to a product's particle size. As solid products do not provide the degree of flowability that is desired, products typically take the form of fluids, particularly liquids. Unfortunately, such fluids require complex dosing equipment or they are messy as they can drip after dosing and thus contaminate surfaces, such as the container opening or associated dosing device. Furthermore, such contamination can make reopening the container difficult as the product can glue the container's opening device to the body of the container. In addition, dosing of liquids from a container, such as a rigid container, requires ingress of vapor to fill the volume displaced by outflow of the liquid. Thus if dosing is performed through a narrow egress, an additional ingress port may be required.<br>
Thus, while particulates are disclosed, see for example WO 2006/048142 A2; WO 2007/014601 Al and USP 5,324,649, what is needed is a particulate that flows in a manner that is similar to a fluid, yet which does not have the disadvantages of a fluid. The particle taught herein satisfies such need.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to flow able particulates comprising certain particles and compositions comprising such particulates; and processes for making and using such particulates and products.<br><br>

As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" when used in a claim, are understood to mean one or more of what is claimed or described.<br>
As used herein, the term "layer" means a partial or complete coating of a layering material built up on a particle's surface or on a coating covering at least a portion of said surface.<br>
As used herein, the term "Product Growth Factor" means the ratio of the product mass to the mass of the initial seeds.<br>
As used herein, the term "Layering Rate" is defined as: Layering Rate = M|PRODUCT / (Mseed<t tiayering where mproduct is the total product mass mseed initial seed and t layering material application time. in case of a batch process tiering elapsed time including binder powder additions. continuous tiayenng rate divided by holdup unit operation.></t>
As used herein, the term "Product Yield" means the ratio of the net product mass to the total product mass. The net product mass is determined after post-layering tieatments such as but not limited to drying, elutriation, and classification. The total product mass is the product mass after layering but before post-layering treatment.<br>
As used herein, the term "Yield Rate" means the multiplicative product of the Layering Rate and the Product Yield: Yield Rate - (Product Yield) * (Layering Rate).<br>
As used herein, the term "seed" means any particle that can be coated or partially-coated by a layer. Thus, a "seed" may consist of an initial seed particle or a seed with any number of previous layers.<br>
3 As used herein, the term "Critical Gap Dimension" means the diameter of the largest circle that can be fully inscribed within the open flat planar orifice area perpendicular to the product flow direction through said orifice.<br>
As used herein the term "independent streams" means that said streams are physically separated and/or separated in time. In one example, independent streams refers to separate feed streams of binder and layering powder that are added at the same time, but in spatially separate locations within the mixing process. In another example, a mixing process with one or more ingress locations is used, and binder and layering powder are added into the process at different times.<br>
As used herein the term "swept volume" means the volume that is intersected by a mixing tool attached to a rotating shaft during a full rotation of the shaft.<br>

Particulate<br>
 The particulates disclosed herein can provide controlled dosing without the negatives that are associated with fluid products. As the benefits of flowability are desired in many products, in one aspect said particulate may be an industrial chemical; edible food, instant beverage mix, drug or nutriceutical; a pet food and/or pet care particulate; or a detergent, fabric treatment, persona] cleaning, hair care and/or fertilizer particulate. Versions of Applicants' particulates may be used in any application, particularly wherein flowability is desired, for example, cleaning and/or treatment products, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, foods, pet-foods, instant beverages, and nutraceuticals.<br>
In one aspect, Applicants' particulate has a Relative Jamming Onset of from about 2 to about 14, from about 2.5 to about 12, from about 3 to about 10, or even from about 4 to about 8 particles.

Suitable materials for making the aforementioned particle depend on the end product application. Such materials are known to the skilled artisan. However they may include, for example, seed materials, binder materials and layering powder materials - each of the aforementioned materials may be an active material or an inert material.<br>
Seed materials are commonly available as granular grades of feedstock materials.   Said<br>
feed stocks may be raw materials obtained from a supplier or may be an intermediate granule that<br>
is produced by any number of granulation processes. Suitable seeds may have a median particle<br>
diameter of from about 150 microns to about 1700 microns, from about 200 microns to about<br>
1200 microns, from about 250 microns to about 850 microns, or even from about 300 microns to<br>
about 600 microns; a seed bulk density of from about 50 grams per liter to about 2000 grams per<br>
liter, from about 200 grams per liter to about 1650 grams per liter, from about 350 to about 1200<br>
grams per liter or even from about 400 grams per liter to about 850 grams per liter; optionally a<br>
size distribution span of from about 1.0 to about 2.0, from about 1.05 to about 1.7, or even from<br>
about 1.1 to about 1.5; and optionally a median particle aspect ratio of from about 1 to about 2,<br>
from about 1 to about 1.5, or even from about 1 to about 1.3. For detergent applications, suitable<br>
active seed materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting<br>
of surfactants, builders, buffering agents, soluble polymers, optical brighteners, and mixtures<br>
thereof.  In certain applications, an active oil-based component may be mixed in molten carrier<br>
such as tristearin or wax and then prilled to form a solid seed.   Stabilizers, antioxidants, and<br>
preservatives may be incorporated within active seeds. Suitable inert seed materials include, but<br>
are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of salts, bi-salts, starches, sugars<br>
and mixtures thereof.   In one aspect, porous seeds may be used as a carrier for other active<br>
materials, including but not limited to, perfumes, flavors,  vitamins, nutritional oils, and<br>
microencapsulates thereof.   In one aspect, said active is not a surfactant.  In one aspect, hollow<br>
particles may be used as seeds.   In one aspect, an encapsulate may be used as a seed, said<br>
encapsulate comprising a wall that encapsulates a material, such as a perfume, flavor, vitamin,<br>
nutritional oil and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
The seeds disclosed in the present specification may have any combination of median particle diameter, seed bulk density, size distribution span, median particle aspect ratio and type and number of components detailed above and throughout this application, including the claims and examples.<br>
Suitable active binder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of acid surfactant precursors, surfactants, polymer solutions or their acid precursors, silicones, chelant solutions, silicate solutions, cellulosic solutions or dispersions, dye solutions, pigment dispersions, molten polymers, molten waxes, molten fatty acids, nutritional oils and mixtures thereof. Suitable inert binder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of water, salt solutions, sugar solutions and mixtures thereof. Suitable binders may include, but are not limited to, solutions, dispersions or emulsions of actives in an active or inert base. Examples of actives include, but are not limited to, oil solubles such as mixed tocopherols,' BHT, gallates, ubiquinone, fatty esters of ascobic acid, beta carotene, and polyphenols. Suitable binders may have a viscosity of from about 0.5 cp to about 4000 cp, from about 1 cp to about 2000 cp, from about 2 cp to about 1000 cp, from about 5 cp to about 600 cp, or even from about 20 cp to about 400 cp.  While not being bound by theory, it is believed that suitable binders may function in Applicants' process by first wetting the surface of seed particles, rendering the seed particles sufficiently sticky to bind the layering powder onto the seed structure, and then most preferably undergoing a chemical or physical transition from a liquid to a solid or semi-solid phase.  In one aspect, the liquid binder may transform to a solid phase by a chemical reaction with the layering powder. In one aspect, a molar excess of the layering powder reactant is required in order to achieve substantially complete conversion of the binder reactant.  In one aspect, the liquid binder may transform to a solid phase by solidification on cooling from a hot melt. In one aspect, a reactive liquid binder may be first blended with a molten binder, and then the blended binder system is transformed into a solid phase by a combination of chemical reaction with layering powder and congealing upon cooling, thus reducing the excess amount of layering powder reactant that may be required with the reactive binder alone.   In one aspect, a liquid binder may transform to a solid phase by a chemical reaction with another binder composition.   In one aspect, a liquid binder may transform to a solid phase by evaporation of a solvent. In one aspect, the binder may comprise a liquid.<br>
Suitable active layering powder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of surfactants, soluble polymers, builders, buffering agents,<br>
 starches, optical brighteners, dyes, pigments and mixtures thereof. Suitable inert layering powder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of salts, bi-salts, sugars, starches, polymers, pigments, dyes and mixtures thereof. Other actives, stabilizers, preservatives or antioxidants can be incorporated into the dry layering powder, including ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, the fatty acid esters of ascorbic acid, bisulfites, pyrophosphates, tetrasodium hydryoxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP), trisodium ethylenediamine-disuccinate (EDDS), chelants, for example citric acid, tetrasodium carboxylatomethyl-glutamate (Dissolvine® or GLDA),   trisodium   methylglycinediacetate   (Trilon®   M   or   MGDA),   diethylene   triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and herbal extracts, for example, rosemary extract.   In one aspect, layering powder compositions contain at lease one hydratable material.   Suitable layering powders may have a median particle size from about 1 micron to about 100 microns, from about 2 to about 50 microns or even from about 3 microns to about 30 microns. In one aspect of Applicants' invention, a dry solids comminution mill may be used to reduce the particle size of the layering materials to the desired particle size.  A suitable comminution mill can be obtained from Hosokawa Alpine Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Co. OHG, Augsburg,    Germany;    Netzsch-Feinmahltechnik    GmbH,    Selb/Bayem,    Germany;    RSG Incorporated, Sylacauga, Alabama, USA. In one aspect, small-scale prototypes may be used. For example, a bench-top micronizer may be used to reduce the particle size of layering powders; a suitable bench-top micronizer is available from Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany<br>
In one aspect, the particle's seed may comprise an active material and at least one of the layers coating said seed comprise an active material, for example an active binder, an active layering powder or mixture thereof. In another aspect, the particle may comprise an inert seed and at least one of the layers coating said seed may comprise an active material, for example an active binder, an active layering powder or mixture thereof. In another aspect, the particle may comprise a seed that may comprise an active material and one or more inert layers.<br>
In one aspect, the particle's active ingredients may include hygroscopic materials.<br>
In another said aspect, said hygroscopic materials are located in the seed or inner layer structure, with an outer layer consisting of comparatively less hygroscopic or non-hygroscopic materials. In one aspect, applicant's particulate has a Rapid Stability Relative Jamming Onset of from about 2 to about 18, from about 2 to about 14, from about 2.5 to about 12, from about 3 to about 10, or even from about 4 to about 8 particles.<br>

In one aspect, fines may be removed by screening and/or elutriation of fines, such as attrition products and excess unattached layering powder, in equipment such as, a vibratory screener, fluid bed, airlift, and/or a mixer having supplemental air fluidization. In one aspect, convective air drying with heated air may be incorporated in the air-elutriation step.<br>
In one aspect, fines may be processed through a high-speed grinding mill before being recycled back into the process as layering powder. A suitable high-speed grinding mill is available from Hosokawa Alpine Aktiengesellschaft &amp; Co. OHG, Augsburg, Germany; Netzsch-Feinmahltechnik GmbH, Selb/Bayern, Germany; RSG Incorporated, Sylacauga, Alabama, USA.<br>

A vibratory screener suitable for screening out either oversize or undersize particles is available from Sweco, Florence, Kentucky, USA; Kason Corporation, Millburn, New Jersey, USA; Mogensen GmbH, Wedel/Hamburg, Germany.<br>
In one aspect said layering process of independently contacting said mass of seeds with a binder and a layering powder is selected from the processes of simultaneously contacting a mass of seeds with independent streams of said binder and said layering powder; contacting said mass<br><br>
 of seeds in a first location with a stream of said binder and then contacting said seed-binder mixture with a stream of said layering powder in a second location; contacting a mass of seeds with a stream of said layering powder in a first location and then contacting said seed-powder mixture with a stream of said binder in a second location or combination thereof. When more than one layer is required, said contacting process may be repeated one or more times. In one aspect, said layering process may optionally include, but are not limited to, an air-elutriation step to remove any excess fine particles that are not incorporated into layers.<br>
In one aspect, a ploughshare mixer with a chopper located between the ploughs is used where binder ingress is directed just below the chopper location and layering powder ingress is above the chopper location. A suitable ploughshare mixer can be obtained from: Lodige GmbH (Paderborn, Germany); Littleford Day, Inc. (Florence, Kentucky, U.S.A.). In this aspect, the circumferential convective flow induced by the main ploughshare impeller is such that the seeds are alternately contacted with binder and layering powder. In one aspect, a ploughshare mixer is used where the ingress locations of binder and layering powder are separated in the axial direction. In one aspect, a continuous ploughshare mixer is used with either axial and/or circumferential separations of binder and layering powder.<br>
In one aspect, a counter-rotating dual-axis paddle mixer is used, wherein the counter-rotating shafts are in a horizontal orientation and the paddles attached to the rotating shafts move in an upward trajectory in the space between the parallel counter-rotating shafts and return in a downward trajectory on die outside of the shafts. A suitable counter-rotating dual-axis paddle mixer can be obtained from Forberg International AS, Larvik, Norway; and Dynamic Air Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. The motion of the paddles in-between the shafts constitutes a converging flow zone, creating substantial fluidization of the particles in the center of the mixer. During operation of the mixer the tilt of the paddles on each shaft may create opposing convective flow fields in the axial directions generating an additional shear field in the converging flow zone. The downward trajectory of the paddles on the outside of the shafts constitutes a downward convective flow.<br>
In one aspect, the gap between a paddle tip and mixer wall has a narrow clearance below the horizontal plane of the paddle axes, for example a gap clearance of less than about 2 cm. In one aspect, below said horizontal plane, the curvature of the mixer wall contains a volume that is only slightly bigger than the swept volume of the paddles. In one aspect, the narrow gap clearance may be extended above the horizontal axis plane, for example by extending the<br>
 curvature of the mixer wall or by adding an insert such as a shroud. While not being bound by theory, Applicants believe that said extension of the narrow gap clearance provides a more uniform shear field in the mixer, especially when running at a Froude Number greater than one, i.e., when inertial acceleration of the paddles exceeds gravity. While not being bound by theory, Applicants believe that said extension of the narrow gap clearance above the horizontal axis plane mitigates the potential for build-up of material on the wall, thereby increasing the Product Yield.<br>
In one aspect, a counter-rotating dual-axis paddle mixer is used where binder ingress is<br>
via a top-spray in the central fluidized zone and layering powder ingress is at the sides or corners<br>
of the mixer into the downward convective flow.   In one aspect, a counter-rotating dual-axis<br>
paddle mixer is used where the binder ingress is provided such that the binder is added upward<br>
into the converging flow zone between the counter-rotating paddle axes, and the layering powder<br>
ingress is at a side or corner location such that the layering powder is added in the downward<br>
convective flow of the mixer.   In one aspect, ingress for binder or layering powder may be<br>
provided through an opening in the mixer wall or an opening in a mixer insert such as a shroud.<br>
In one aspect, said upward addition of binder into the converging flow zone can be done by<br>
adding a binder distributor pipe with one or more holes running parallel to the axial direction of<br>
the mixer, where the mixer is modified to allow clearance for said distributor pipe just below the<br>
converging flow zone. In one aspect, binder can be added upward into the converging flow zone<br>
through one or more binder addition pipes or nozzles, where the mixer is modified to allow<br>
clearance of a pipe or nozzle through the mixer wall at a position below the converging flow<br>
zone, In one aspect, said layering powder ingress is positioned such ihut suid powder is fed into<br>
the downward paddle trajectory of the dual-axis paddle mixer.   In these cases, the convective<br>
flow induced by the paddle impellers is such that the seeds may be alternately contacted with<br>
binder and layering powder in separate locations of the mixer.  In one aspect, multiple layering<br>
powder ingress locations are provided. While not being bound by theory, Applicants believe that<br>
such multiple locations create multiple convective loops in which to alternately contact seeds<br>
with binder and layering powder.    In addition, while not being bound by theory, Applicants<br>
believe that scale-up of the layering process is facilitated by increasing the number of convective<br>
loops. While not being bound by theory, Applicants believe that mixer selection may depend on<br>
the strength of the seed relative to the shear intensity within the mixer.<br><br>
In one aspect, said layering step may be repeated a sufficient number of times to increase the particulate mass by a factor of more than about two compared to the initial seed mass, more than about four, or even more than about six times the initial seed mass.<br>
In one aspect, said layering step may be repeated a sufficient number of times to increase the particulate mass by a factor of from about 2 to about 100 compared to the initial seed mass.<br>

In one aspect, oversize material may be removed by screening, such oversized material may be reduced in size by milling and such milled material may be transported to, for example by a recycle loop, and used in one or more of the processes mixers as a seed material. In one aspect, said series of mixers is arranged in a continuous process with continuous in-flow of seeds and out-flow of product granules.<br>

a. piiu-Arying process can oe used to torm particles around a droplet template and then coated with a fine layering powder. Prill-congealing and prill-drying equipment are available from GEA/Niro of Columbia, Maryland, U.S.A.<br>

Applicants recognized that Stokes numbers can be used to define processing parameters for layering and agglomeration processes. As such, Applicants' processes may be conducted according to the following process parameters: Layering Stokes Number of less than 10, from about 0.001 to about 10 or even from about 0.001 to about 5, and a Coalescence Stokes Number of greater than 0.5, from about 1 to about 1000 or even from about 2 to about 1000. The aforementioned Stokes numbers can be calculated as follows:<br>
Stmixer = (0.0001)N-Rp-8/<br>
T| The variables in the above equation are specified with units of measurement as follows: N is the rotational speed of the main agitation impeller shaft in the mixer (revolutions<br>
per minute, abbreviated as RPM) R in radial sweep distance of the main agitation impeller, from the center of the impeller shaft to the tip of the impeller tool, for example a paddle or ploughshare impeller tool (meters, abbreviated as m); p is bulk density of the seed particles (grams/liter, abbreviated as g/1); T| is binder viscosity (centipoises, abbreviated as cp); and<br>
8 is effective particle size used to describe layering or agglomeration (microns, abbreviated as um), where:<br>
^layering<br>
is defined as 2(dseeddlayring)/(dseor1+dUyerjng), and ^coalescence is defined as dseed; where<br>
dseed is the median particle size of the seed material, and<br>
diayering is the median particle size of the layering powder material.<br><br>
 Based on the above, two sub-forms of the Stokes equation can be defined, one to describe the binding of the layering powder onto the seed particles (Stiayering), and another to describe the coalescence of seed particles with other seeds (Stcoalescence).<br>
Layering Stokes Number, Stiayering = (0.0001) • N • R • p • 6iayerjng / r] Coalescence Stokes Number, Stc0aiescence = (0.0001) • N • R • p • 5^^^ I x\ For the purpose of calculating said Stokes Numbers, the relevant characteristics of seeds, layering powders and binders are based on their measured values before addition to the layering process. In the aspect of a compound layering process conducted in a sequence of two or more mixer stages, Stokes Numbers for each stage are based on the characteristic bulk density and size of the seed material used at the start or entrance or each stage. In the aspect of a layering process using concurrent addition of more than one binder, then the volume-weighted average of the binder viscosity is used for the Stokes Number calculation. In the aspect of a layering process using concurrent addition of more than one layering powder, then the mass-weighted average of the layering powder median particle size is used for the Stokes Number calculation.<br>

TEST METHODS It is understood that the test methods that are disclosed in the Test Methods Section of the present application must be used to determine the respective values of the parameters of Applicants' inventions as such inventions are described and claimed herein.<br>
1.) Layering Powder Median Particle Size Test<br>
This test method must be used to determine a layering powder's median particle size. The layering powder's particle size test is determined in accordance with ISO 8130-13, "Coating powders - Part 13: Particle size analysis by laser diffraction." A suitable laser diffraction particle size analyzer with a dry-powder feeder can be obtained from Horiba Instruments Incorporated of Irvine, California, U.S.A.; Malvern Instruments Ltd of Worcestershire, UK; Sympatec GmbH of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany; and Beckman-Coulter Incorporated of Fullerton, California, U.S.A.<br><br>
 The results are expressed in accordance with ISO 9276-1:1998, "Representation of results of particle size analysis - Part 1: Graphical Representation", Figure A.4, "Cumulative distribution Q3 plotted on graph paper with a logarithmic abscissa." The median particle size is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative distribution (Q3) is equal to 50 percent.<br>
2.) Binder Component Viscosity Test<br>
This test method must be used to determine binder component viscosity. The binder component viscosity is determined using an apparent viscosity obtained by the Brookfield test method. A suitable viscometer, for example Brookfield type LV (LVT or LVDV series) with UL adapter, can be obtained from Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc., Middleboro, Massachusetts, USA. The binder component viscosity test is conducted in accordance with the Brookfield Operating Manual, following the guidelines of ISO 2555, second edition published February 1, 1989 and reprinted with corrections February 1, 1990, "Plastics - resins in the liquid state or as emulsions or dispersions - Determination of apparent viscosity by the Brookfield Test method," with the following qualifications: a.)       A Brookfield LV series viscometer with UL adapter is used.<br>
b.) A rotational frequency of 60 revolutions per minute is used. The spindle is chosen in accordance with the permitted operating range specified in Clause 4 of ISO 2555. In the case where the rotational frequency of 60 revolutions per minute cannot be used based on the permitted operating range, then the highest speed that is less than 60 revolutions per minute and is in accordance with the permitted range of Clause 4 shall be used, c.) The viscosity measurement is performed at the same binder component temperature at which the binder component is introduced into the layering process.<br>
3.) Seed Material Median Particle Size and Distribution Span Test<br>
This test method must be used to determine seed material median particle size. The seed material particle size test is conducted to determine the median particle size of the seed material using ASTM D 502 - 89, "Standard Test Method for Particle Size of Soaps and Other Detergents", approved May 26, 1989, with a further specification for sieve sizes used in the analysis. Following section 7, "Procedure using machine-sieving method," a nest of clean dry sieves containing U.S. Standard (ASTM E 11) sieves #8 (2360 um), #12 (1700<br><br>
above sieve nest. The seed material is used as the sample. A suitable sieve-shaking machine can be obtained from W.S. Tyler Company of Mentor, Ohio, U.S.A.<br>
The data are plotted on a semi-log plot with the micron size opening of each sieve plotted against the logarithmic abscissa and the cumulative mass percent (Q3) plotted against the linear ordinate. An example of the above data representation is given in ISO 9276-1:1998, "Representation of results of particle size analysis - Part 1: Graphical Representation", Figure A.4. The seed material median particle size (D50), for the purpose of this invention, is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative mass percent is equal to 50 percent, and is calculated by a straight line interpolation between the data points directly above (a50) and below (b50) the 50% value using the following equation:<br>
D50 = 10A[Log(Da50) - (Log(Da50) - Log(Db50))*(Qa5o- 50%)/(Qa50- QMO)] where Qaso and Qb5o are the cumulative mass percentile values of the data immediately above and below the 50th percentile, respectively; and Da50 and Db50 are the micron sieve size values corresponding to these data.<br>
In the event diat the 50th percentile value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um) or above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then additional sieves must be added to the nest following a geometric progression of not greater than 1.5, until the median falls between two measured sieve sizes.<br>
The Distribution Span of the Seed Material is a measure of the breadth of the seed size distribution about the median. It is calculated according to the following:<br>
Span = (D84/D5o + D50/D16) / 2<br>
Where D50 is the median particle size and Dg4 and D16 are the particle sizes at the sixteenth and eighty-fourth percentiles on the cumulative mass percent retained plot, respectively.<br>
In the event that the Di6 value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um), then the span<br>
is calculated according to the following:<br>
Span = (D84/D50).<br>
In the event that the D84 value falls above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then the<br>
span is calculated according to the following:<br>
Span = (D50/D16).<br><br>
 In the event that the D16 value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um) and the D84 value falls above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then the distribution span is taken to be a maximum value of 5.7.<br>
4.1 Bulk Density Test<br>
The seed material bulk density is determined in accordance with Test Method B, Loose-fill Density of Granular Materials, contained in ASTM Standard E727-02, "Standard Test Methods for Determining Bulk Density of Granular Carriers and Granular Pesticides," approved October 10, 2002.<br>
5.) Flowable Particle Mass Based Cumulative Particle Size Distribution Test<br>
This test method must be used to determine the median particle size (D50) and the 30th percentile particle size (D30) of the flowable particulate. This test follows the same procedure that is specified for the "Seed Material Median Particle Size Test" described above except that the method is used to measure:<br>
a)	Selected particle size percentiles of the flowable particulate, and<br>
b)	Selected particle size percentiles of the full admixed composition containing the flowable particulate.<br>
In part (a), the "Seed Material Median Particle Size Test" is performed using the flowable particle as the sample instead of the seed material. The median particle size (D50) is calculated in the same manner. In addition, the 30th percentile particle size (D30) is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative mass percent is equal to 30 percent, and is calculated by a straight line interpolation between the data points directly above (a30) and below (b30) the 30% value using the following equation:<br>
D30 = 10A[Log(Da30) - (Log(Da30) - Log(Db3o))*(Qa30- 30%)/(Qa30- QMO)] where Qa3o and Ob30 are the cumulative mass percentile values of the data immediately above and below the 30* percentile, respectively; and Da30 and Db3o are the micron sieve size values corresponding to these data.<br>
In the event that the 30th percentile value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um), then additional sieves must be added to the nest following a geometric progression of not greater than 1.5, until the 30th percentile falls between two measured sieve sizes.<br>
In part (b), the procedure of part (a) above is used with the full admixed composition instead of the flowable particulate.<br><br>
 Jamming Onset Test<br>
Jamming Onsets are measured using a Flodex™ instrument supplied by Hanson Research Corporation, Chatsworth, California, USA. As used in this test method the term "Hopper" refers to the Cylinder Assembly of the Flodex™ instrument; the term "orifice" refers to the hole in the center of the Flow Disk that is used in a flow test; the symbol "B" refers to the diameter of the orifice in the Flow Disk used in the test; and the symbol "b" refers to the dimensionless orifice size, as defined by the ratio of the orifice diameter to the 30th percentile particle size (D30) specified in Applicant's Test Method #5 titled "Flowable Particle Mass Based Cumulative Particle Size Distribution Test", b = B / D30.<br>
The Flodex™ instrument is operated in accordance with the instructions contained in the Flodex™ operation manual version 21-101-000 rev. C 2004-03 with the following exceptions:<br>
a.) The suitable container that is used to collect the material that is tested is tared on a balance with 0.01 gram precision before the start of the test, and used subsequently to measure the mass of particulate discharge from the Hopper in step c, below, b.) Sample preparation. A bulk sample of particles is suitably riffled to provide a sub-sample of 150 ml loose-fill volume. The appropriate sample mass can be determined by measuring the loose fill density specified in Test Method # 4, titled "Bulk Density Test", and then multiplying by the target volume (150 ml). The mass of the sample (sample mass) is recorded before the start of each test measurement. As the test is non destructive, the same sample may be used repeatedly. The entire sample must be discharged, e.g., by inverting the hopper, and then re-loaded before each measurement, c.) Starting with the smallest orifice size (typically 4 mm unless a smaller orifice is necessary), three repeat measurements are taken for each orifice size. For each measurement, the sample is loaded into the Hopper and allowed to rest for a rest interval of about 30 seconds before the orifice is opened according to the procedure described in the Flodex™ Operation Manual. The sample is allowed to discharge into the tared container for a period of at least 60 seconds. After this 60 second period and once the flow stops and remains stopped for 30 seconds (i.e., no more than 0.1 mass % of the material is discharged over the 30 second stop Interval), then the mass of<br><br><br>
 discharged material is measured, the orifice is closed and the Hopper is fully emptied by inverting the Hopper assembly or removing the flow disk. Note: if the flow stops and then re-starts during the 30 second stop interval, then the stop interval clock must be re-started at zero at the next flow stoppage. For each measurement, the mass% discharged is calculated according to the formula: (mass% discharged) = 100 * (mass discharged) / (sample mass). The average of the three mass% discharged measurements is plotted as a function of the dimensionless orifice size (b = B/D30), with the mass% discharged on the ordinate and the dimensionless orifice size on the abscissa. This procedure is repeated using incrementally larger orifice sizes until the hopper discharges without jamming for three consecutive times, as per the description of a "positive result" in the Flodex™ Operation Manual.<br>
d.) The plotted data are then linearly interpolated to find the Relative Jamming Onset (Jrei), which is defined as the value of the dimensionless orifice size at the point of 25 mass% average discharge. This is determined by the abscissa value (b) at the point where the interpolation is equal to 25 mass% discharge. If the average mass% discharge exceeds 25% for the starting orifice, then flow disks with smaller orifices must be obtained and the test repeated starting with the smaller orifice. Flow disks with smaller orifices such as 3.5, 3.0, 2.5 or even 2.0 mm can be obtained as custom parts from Hanson Research Corporation.<br>
e) The Absolute Jamming Onset (JabS) is defined as the product of the Relative Jamming Onset and the D30 particle size, Jabs = Jrei * D30-<br>
7.) Rapid Stability Relative Jamming Onset Test<br>
The Rapid Stability Relative Jamming Onset Test is a measure of the physical stability of the particulate flow property on exposure to a warm, humid environment. The test is performed in accordance with Test Method #6 titled "Jamming Onset Test" with the following qualifications:<br>
a) An environmental aging step is added, whereby the 150 ml sample of Test Method #6 is placed in a 250 ml beaker and then aged by placing the uncovered sample in an environmental test chamber at 27 degrees Celsius and 60% relative humidity for a period of 48 hours. The 250 ml beaker is straight sided with an open top and an inside diameter of about 6.5 cm. A suitable constant temperature and humidity chamber may<br><br><br>
 be obtained from Lunaire Environmental Products, New Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA; Weiss-Gallenkamp, Loughborough, UK, ESPEC, Hudsonville, Michigan, USA.<br>
b)	The remainder of the Jamming Onset Test is performed on the aged sample. After removing an aged sample from the environmental chamber, it may be used in the Jamming Onset Test for a time period not to exceed 20 minutes. If additional time is required to complete the test, then multiple aged samples must be prepared. Note it may be necessary to tap the beaker or even break up the aged particulate sample using a spatula in order to discharge it from the beaker at the end of the aging period.<br>
c)	The Rapid Stability Relative Jamming Onset is obtained according to the Relative Jamming Onset calculation, using the D30 value of the particulate measured before aging in the 48 hour environmental test.<br>
8.) Particle Aspect Ratio Test<br>
The particle aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the particle's major axis diameter (dmajor) relative to the particle's minor axis diameter (dminor), where the major and minor axis diameters are the long and short sides of a rectangle that circumscribes a 2-dimensional image of the particle at the point of rotation where the short side of the rectangle is minimized. The 2-dimensional image is obtained using a suitable microscopy technique. For the purpose of this method, the particle area is defined to be the area of the 2-dimensional particle image.<br>
In order to determine the aspect ratio distribution and the median particle aspect ratio, a suitable number of representative 2-dimensional particle images must be acquired and analyzed. For the purpose of this test, a minimum of 5000 particle images is required. In order to facilitate collection and image analysis of this number of particles, an automated imaging and analysis system is recommended. Such systems can be obtained from Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, California, USA; JM Canty, Inc., Buffalo, New York, USA; Retsch Technology GmbH, Haan, Germany; and Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany.<br>
A suitable sample of particles is obtained by riffling.  The sample is then processed and analyzed by the image analysis system, to provide a list of particles containing major and minor axis attributes.   The aspect ratio (AR) of each particle is calculated according to the ratio of the particle's major and minor axis, AK = umajor / umjnor.<br><br>
cumulative particle area is calculated as the running sum of particle areas in the sorted list. The particle aspect ratio is plotted against the abscissa and the cumulative particle area against the ordinate. The median particle aspect ratio is the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative particle area is equal to 50% of the total particle area of the distribution.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Seed Materials.<br>
Seed materials are commonly available as granular grades of feedstock materials with a particle size, size distribution, aspect ratio and density that is within the description of the invention. Suitable single-component seeds include granular grades of sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, sodium bisulfate, sodium citrate, citric acid, lactose, sugar, whey, and starch granules. Such seeds may be useful for a broad range of applications.<br>
Examples of composite compositions for use as detergent seeds are given in Tables 1A and IB, Intermediate Detergent Compositions, Columns a through x. Such composite seeds are prepared by an independent detergent granulation process such as mechanical agglomeration, spray drying or extrusion, and then classified to meet the seed size specification. Such processes for making intermediate granular compositions are well known to those familiar with the art.<br>
In one aspect, an intermediate detergent composition (e.g., as per Table 1) may be classified into two portions, one portion that is suitable for use as seeds, and a second portion that is not needed or not suitable for use as seeds. The second portion may then be milled into a fine powder that is suitable for layering. In this way, the total amount of the intermediate composition can be consumed in the layering process, either as seeds or as layering powder. Further, the portioning of an intermediate material into seed and layering fractions provides for control of the layering process, relative to the ratio of the binder and layering powder, as well as control over the product attributes, for example the layered particle size relative to the initial seed size.<br>

Example 2: Layering Powders.<br>
While suitable layering powders may be available directly as powder-grade raw materials, supplemental comminution may be necessary to reduce the particle size to the desired size range as per the description of the invention, for example, using a high speed pin mill.<br>
The composition of the layering powder depends on the product application. Layering powders may provide physical and/or chemical adsorption of the liquid binder within the layer structure. When using reactive or aqueous binders, it is preferred that at least one component of the layering powder include a material that is capable of reacting with the binder; in doing so, converting the binder to a solid or semi-solid phase. For example, the layering powder may participate in an acid-base or hydration reaction with other materials or<br><br>
 intermediates in the layering process.   For example, when using an aqueous binder, it is desired that the layering powder include at least one hydratable material.<br>
Examples of suitable layering materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of sugars, acetates, citrates, sulfates, carbonates, borates, phosphates, acidic precursors and mixtures thereof. Examples of sugars and carbohydrate salts include, but are not limited to, lactose, calcium lactate, and trehalose. Examples of acetates include, but are not limited to, magnesium acetate, Mg(CH3COO)2: and sodium acetate, NaCH3COO. Examples of citrates include, but are not limited to, sodium citrate, C6H507Na3; and citric acid, C6H8O7. Examples of sulfates include, but are not limited to, magnesium sulfate, MgSCV, and sodium sulfate, Na2SO4. Examples of carbonates include, but are not limited to, sodium carbonate, Na2CO3; potassium carbonate, K2CO3. Examples of borates include, but are not limited to, sodium borate, Na2B407. Examples of phosphates include, but are not limited to, sodium phosphate dibasic, Na2HPO4; and sodium tripolyphosphate, Na5P3O10. Layering powders containing such materials may be introduced to the layering process as substantially anhydrous salts. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that their conversion to stable hydrate phases provides a mechanism for the removal of binder moisture and enables processing to proceed with improved control. If the hydration capacity of the material is sufficient, the process can be done without the requirement of a drying step.<br>
Additional active layering powder materials for detergent applications include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of surfactants, soluble polymers, builders, buffering agents, optical brighteners and mixtures thereof. In one aspect, the layering powder is made by milling an intermediate detergent composition, for example, the compositions as given in Tables lA and IB to produce compositions in rows 7-15 of Table 2A and rows 12-16 of Table 2B.<br><br>

Example 3: Binders.<br>
While the binder choice depends on the application, a preferred binder system includes at least one binder component that is capable of undergoing a chemical or physical transformation from a liquid to solid or semi-solid phase. In the case of a chemical transformation, the binder preferentially reacts with a component of the layering powder. Suitable non-reactive binders may be used to the extent that they can be physically adsorbed in the layering structure. Examples of suitable non-reactive binders include, but are not limited to, perfume oils, flavoring oils and nutritional oils.<br><br>
 For detergent applications, suitable active binder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of acid surfactant precursors, liquid or molten surfactants or surfactant solutions of anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic surfactants, liquid or molten polymers, polymer solutions, acidic polymers, silicate solutions, cellulosic solutions or dispersions, molten fatty acids or alcohols, waxes and mixtures thereof. Suitable inert binder materials include, but are not limited to, materials selected from the group consisting of water, salt solutions, sugar solutions and mixtures thereof.<br>
Example 4:   Process for making a layered granule for automatic dishwashing detergent using spatially-separated binder and layering powder streams. The seed particle composition in Table 1A column (a), obtained from Procter &amp; Gamble Co., is sieved to a particle size cut of between about 300 and 850 microns, using a Sweco 24" Vibro-Energy Round Separator.   A mass of about 75 kg of the seed particles, with a bulk density of about 1.07 kg/liter is then dosed into a dual-axis counter-rotating paddle mixer (Bella™ B-120XN, available from Dynamic Air, St. Paul, MN, USA), modified for binder addition using a distributor pipe located below the converging flow zone. The mixer is turned on, with two shafts counter-rotating at about 100 RPM.  Each shaft has 14 paddles mounted in 7 pairs per shaft.   A liquid mass of about 0.6 kg of linear alcohol alkoxylate, heated to obtain a viscosity of about 40 cp, is added via pressure spray nozzle into the top of the mixer at a rate of about 200 lbs/hr, so as to form atomized droplets and then contact said droplets with the particles in the center of the mixer, where the seed particles are fluidized.   An atomized spray of sodium polyacrylate polymer binder solution of about 30 wt% solids is then started through nozzles mounted on the top-center of the mixer so as to contact binder droplets with the fluidized seed particles in the center of the mixer. The polymer solution is sprayed on at a rate of about 75 lbs/hr for about 6 minutes. Concurrently, the layering powder of Table 2A column (a) is added into the top of the mixer, split equally through two ingress ports located at diagonal comers of the mixer, directed over positions of downward paddle trajectory nearest to the end walls of the mixer, at a rate of about 900 lbs/hr for 6 minutes. Also concurrently, a sodium silicate binder solution of about 34 wt% solids is added through the distributor bar directing flow upwards into the converging flow zone through four holes of about 2 mm diameter straddling the center three paddle positions.    The sodium silicate solution is added at a rate of about 175 lbs/hr for about 5 V2 minutes. The entire process is<br><br>
 allowed to take place over a 6 to 7 minute residence time in the mixer prior to discharge into a second mixer, Bella™ B-200XN with similar modifications for binder addition. The process is then repeated in the second mixer, using the product of the first mixer as seeds, for a similar residence time and including all layering ingredients except the linear alkoxylate, with addition rates for layering powder, silicate and polymer solutions of about 1450, 260, and 110 lbs/hr, respectively.<br>
The resulting batch is discharged, screened to remove any oversize (&gt; 1.2 mm) and treated in a fluid bed with ambient temperature air and a superficial air velocity of about 0.8 m/s for 3 to 7 minutes. The product yield is about 90% accepts; the remainder is treated by milling and recycled either as seeds or layering powder. The cumulative layering process residence time is about 14 minutes, not including the fluid bed treatment. The free moisture in the binder solutions is substantially reacted with the phosphate and carbonate constituents of the layering powder during the layering process, leading to an equivalent conversion of about 80% sodium tripolyphosphate hexahydrate and about 50% sodium carbonate monohydrate. No further product drying is required. The product growth factor is about 2.8 times the amount of initial seed granules. The layering rate is about 20 mass% per minute. The product particle size is characterized by D50 = 630 microns, span = 1.3, and D30 = 540 microns. The product Relative Jamming Onset is about 6.9 particles.<br>
Example 5: Process for making a layered granule for automatic dishwashing detergent using temporally separated binder and layering powder streams. The seed particle composition in Table 1A column (a), obtained from Procter &amp; Gamble Co., is sieved to a particle size cut of between about 300 and 850 microns, using a Sweco 24" Vibro-Energy Round Separator. A mass about 320 g of the seed particles, with a bulk density of about 1.07 kg/liter is then dosed into a high shear food processing-type kitchen mixer (Robot Coupe, model R302V). The mixer is turned on at the low setting so as to create a centrifugal "rope flow" of seed particles rotating in a centrifugal flow pattern against the wall of the mixer. About 4.6 grams of liquid linear alcohol alkoxylate is dosed into the mixer via a syringe through the top inlet such mat the liquid stream contacts the seed particles at an approximately perpendicular angle to the surface of the flow pattern. Sequentially, about 60 grams of layering powder composition given in Table 2A column (a) is added by through the top of the mixer.  Sequentially, about 60 grams of a sodium silicate binder solution of about<br>
 36 wt% solids is added through the top of the mixer, at an approximately perpendicular angle to the surface of the flow pattern. Sequentially, about 145 grams of layering powder composition given in Table 2A column (a) is added by through the top of the mixer. Sequentially, about 27 grams of a sodium polyacrylate polymer binder solution of about 26 wt% solids is added through the top of the mixer, at an approximately perpendicular angle to the surface of the flow pattern. Finally, about 100 grams of layering powder composition given in Table 2A column (a) is added through the top of the mixer. During the batch process, the mixer speed is gradually increased to keep the material moving in a centrifugal flow pattern against the wall of the mixer.<br>
Example 6:    Process for making an effervescent layered granule for medium-duty laundry detergent using temporally separated binder and layering powder streams.<br>
Seed particles are obtained by classifying granular Sodium Bisulfate using screens and selecting the cut between 500 and 1000 microns. Layering powder of Table 2A column (c) is used. The binder is prepared by mixing about 85% linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS) with about 15% molten Tallow Alcohol Ethoxylate (TAE80) at a mixture temperature of about 60°C. The homogeneous binder mix is then kept at about 60°C.<br>
A mass of 203 grams of the seed material is loaded into a Food Processor Model FP370 and the mixer turned on to speed setting #2 to induce a centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer. A series of eight sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding about 15 grams of binder and about 35 to 45 grams of layering powder, adding more binder, more layering powder, etc., until the product composition is built up in layers surrounding the bisulfate seeds.<br>
The binder is converted to a solid phase by a combination of chemical reaction of the HLAS binder with Sodium Carbonate in the layering powder and congealing of the molten TAE80. Without being bound by theory, it is thought that the blended binder system extends the capability of such processing to lower levels of excess sodium carbonate in the layering powder. In addition, the substantially non-aqueous process enables the formation of a composite particle with an acidic core structure (sodium bisulfate) and alkaline layers, such that, when added to water, the particulate effervesces.<br><br>
 Example      7:      Process   for  making   a   layered   heavy-duty  detergent   granule  containing perfume microcapsules using temporally separated binder and layering     powder streams. Seed particles are obtained by first preparing the intermediate granular composition provided in Table 1A column (k) by a spray-drying process.   The resultant spray-dried granules are classified by screening, with the seeds taken from the size cut between 425 microns and 850 microns.  The resultant seeds have a bulk density of about 300 grams/liter, with a porous microstructure.<br>
A mass of 200 grams of the seed material is loaded into a Braun CombiMax 600 Food Processor, type 3205 with blade impeller and the mixer turned on to a speed sufficient to induce a centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer, for example, speed setting #4. Nine grams of an aqueous slurry of perfume microcapsules prepared in accordance with U. S. Pat. 4,100,103, containing about 30 wt% active perfume oil, is then added by syringe such that the stream of the slurry contacts the flow of porous seeds, embedding the microcapsules into the porous particle structure.<br>
The layering powder composition is provided in Table 2A column (k). Two separate binders are used: 1) an acid surfactant precursor such as alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS) and/or alkyl 3-elthoxysulfonic acid (HAE3S), and 2) a sodium polyacrylate solution of about 30 wt% solids. The acid surfactant precursor converts to its sodium salt on contact with fine sodium carbonate in the layering powder. The polyacrylate solution also solidifies by hydration of sodium carbonate.<br>
A series of 6 sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding about 11 grams of acid surfactant precursor binder by syringe, about 45 grams of layering powder by teaspoon, and then about 1 gram of polyacrylate solution by syringe, all delivered sequentially through the top of the mixer, contacting the particulate flow in the mixer. Then the total mass is discharged and classified using sieves, 330 grams are taken from the size cut between 300 microns and 1180 microns and returned to the mixer.<br>
The layering process is then repeated, with a series 6 sequential layering steps, alternately adding about 10 grams of acid surfactant precursor binder by syringe, about 50 grams of layering powder by teaspoon, and then about 1 gram of polyacrylate solution by syringe, all delivered sequentially through the top of the mixer, contacting the particulate flow in the mixer.<br>
 The material is discharged from the mixer and classified using screens to obtain a product with a particle size between about 300 microns and 1180 microns. The resulting bulk density of the product is about 800 grams/liter.<br>
Example 8: Process for making a layered heavy-duty detergent granule using spatially separated binder and layering powder streams and spray-dried seeds. The seed particle composition of Table 1A column (e) is prepared by spray-drying followed by classification between 300 micron and 850 micron screens, using a Sweco 24" Vibro-Energy Round Separator. A layering powder composition of Table 2A column (e) is prepared using a Netzsch CUM-150 pin mill to grind the fine tails of the above spray-dried material as well as sodium carbonate to a median particle size of about 20 microns. Two separate binders are used: linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS), and an aqueous solution of acrylic-maleic copolymer with about 30 wt% solids.<br>
A mass of about 8 kg of the seed particles, with a bulk density of about 0.45 kg/liter is then charged into a dual-axis counter-rotating paddle mixer (Bella™ B-32XN). The mixer is turned on, with two shafts counter-rotating at about 160 RPM. Each shaft has 22 paddles mounted in 11 pairs per shaft. An atomized spray of sodium polyacrylate polymer binder solution of about 30 wt% solids is added through the top of the mixer so as to contact binder droplets with the particles in the center of the mixer, where the seed particles are fluidized. The HLAS binder is added through the bottom of the mixer by use of a 4-holed distributor bar, directing flow upwards into the converging flow zone, straddling the center three paddle positions. The layering powder is added into the top of the mixer, split through two ingress ports located at diagonal corners of the mixer, directed over positions of downward paddle trajectory nearest to the end walls of the mixer. The binders and layering powers are added concurrently as per the "Step 1" section of Table 3, Addition Schedule.<br>
After the Step 1 schedule is complete, a mass of about 11.55 kg of the Step 1 particulate product is charged into the same mixer for use as seeds, and the process is repeated according to Table 3, Step 2. The resulting batch is discharged, screened to remove any oversize (&gt; 1.2 mm) and treated in a fluid bed with ambient temperature air and a superficial air velocity of about 0.8 m/s for about 4 minutes. The binders are substantially converted to solid phases within the layering process and no further drying is required. The product yield is about 90% accepts. The bulk density is about 0.82 kg/liter,  This product is then further layered with a<br><br>
 small amount of perfume oil binder (about 0.2 mass%) and zeolite layering powder (about 0.8 mass%) according to Table 3, Step 3. The perfume layering step is done using the same mixer using about 20 kg of the treated Step 2 product as seeds and a finely atomized spray of perfume added through the top of the mixer so as to contact spray droplets with the particles in the center of the mixer, where the seed particles are fluidized. The total mass-based growth factor of the product relative to initial seeds is about 5.5. The Relative Jamming Onset is about 7.3 particles.<br>
In a manufacturing production scenario, this process may be scaled-up to run with two mixers arranged in series, the second mixer containing about two times the working volume of the first. In this scenario, the particulate product of Step 1 is discharged from mixer 1 into mixer 2 for use as seeds in Step 2. The Step 2 process may be completed in substantially the same time as Step 1, such that the two mixers can be operated in a synchronized batch schedule with minimal idle time. To maintain similar batch times, the Step 2 feed rates of binder and layering powder may be scaled up in proportion to the batch size. Under this production scenario, the Layering Rate can be about 60 mass% per minute or even greater. The Yield Rate can be greater than 50 mass% per minute.<br>

 Example 9:  Process for making a layered heavy-duty detergent granule using separated binder and layering powder streams and granular seeds This example builds layer mass sequentially over three steps, each conducted as batch in a pilot-scale paddle mixer.   The granular seed particle composition of Table 1A column (j) is prepared by a mechanical agglomeration process followed by classification of the granules between 380 micron and 850 micron screens, using a Sweco 24" Vibro-Energy Round Separator.    A layering powder composition is prepared by blending 2:1 mass ratio of micronized soda ash and zeolite A powders.   Two separate binders are used:   linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS) and an aqueous solution of sodium polyacrylate polymer with about 30 wt% solids.<br>
A mass of about 10 kg of the seed particles, with a bulk density of about 0.8 kg/liter is then charged into a dual-axis counter-rotating paddle mixer (Bella™ B-20XE). The mixer is turned on, with two shafts counter-rotating at about 120 RPM.   Each shaft has 14 paddles mounted in 7 pairs per shaft.   The binder is added in sequential stages.   First, an atomized spray of heated HLAS binder, about 60 C, with a viscosity of about 150 cp is added through the top of the mixer so as to contact binder droplets with the fluidized seed particles in the center of the mixer.  Second, the polymer solution binder is also sprayed from the top of the mixer, onto the same center fluidized zone, using a separate nozzle.   Concurrent with the binder sprays, layering powder is added into the top of the mixer, through one ingress port located over a corner of the mixer top, dropping onto an outside (downward moving) paddle position. The binders and layering powers are added as per the "Step 1" section of Table 4, Recipe for Example 9. After the Step 1 schedule is complete, a mass of about 11.16 kg of the Step 1 particulate product is charged into the same mixer, and the process is repeated according to Table 4, Step 2. After the Step 2 schedule is complete, a mass of about 11.65 kg of the Step 2 particulate product is charged into the same mixer, and the process is repeated according to Table 4, Step 3. Depending on the stage of the process, the coalescence Stokes Number ranges between about 7 and 9, and the layering Stokes Number ranges between 0.5 and 0.7. The resulting batch is discharged, screened to remove any oversize (&gt; 1.2 mm). The product yield is about 95% accepts.   The bulk density is about 950 grams/liter.   The mass-based growth factor of the product relative to seeds is about 5.3.   The Relative Jamming Onset is about 6.1 particles. The median particle aspect ratio is about 1.22.<br><br>

A small amount of zeolite powder is used to supplement the layering powder. The binder is linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS)<br>
The product is made over a series of three batch steps, as per Table 5, Recipe for Example 10, using a medium shear ploughshare mixer (Lodige M-20-G Lab Plow Mixer, with a ploughshare agitator radial sweep of about 0.15 meters). The mixer is turned on, with main agitator shaft rotating at about 175 RPM and the chopper running at about 3000 RPM. A stream of heated HLAS binder (about 60" C) with a viscosity of about 150 cp is added through an addition pipe below the chopper. The luyuring powder is added into the tup of the mixer above the chopper location. The coalescence Stokes number, Stcoalesoence. is about 17 and the layering Stokes number, Storing, is about 1.1.<br>

Example 11: Process for making a layered heavy-duty detergent granule using temporally-separated binder and layering powder streams and a mixture of granular seeds. The seed particle compositions given in Table 1A column (1) and Table IB column (m) are prepared by spray drying and mechanical agglomeration processes, respectively, followed by classification between 425 micron and 1400 micron screens. A layering powder composition is prepared according to Table 2A column (1). A binder mix of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (HLAS) and Ethoxylated Hexamethylene Diamine Quat (EHDQ) is prepared using a mass ratio of about 86% HLAS and 14% of the EHDQ. The binder mixture is heated to about 60 C, with a viscosity of about 150 cp.<br>
A mass of about 0.28 kg of the seed particles, consisting of a mass ratio of about 25% granules of Table 1A column (1) and 75% granules of Table IB column (m), with an combined bulk density of about 0.8 kg/liter, is loaded into a Kenwood Food Processor Model FP370 and the mixer turned on to speed setting #2 to induce a centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer. A series of four sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding about 15 grams of binder drop-wise via a syringe, contacting the seed particles in the mixer, followed by about 15 to 25 grams of layering powder, also added through the top of the mixer, adding more binder, more layering powder, etc., until the product composition is built up in layers surrounding the seed particles.<br>
Example 12: Determination of Jamming Onsets<br>
In this example, the details are provided for the determination of the Relative Jamming Onset and Absolute Jamming Onset for the layered granule of Example 9.<br>
First, the 30th percentile particle size (D30) is measured according to Method 5, "Flowable Particle Mass Based Cumulative Particle Size Distribution Test." The 30th cumulative mass% lies between 600 um and 850 um., as per Table 6, "Particle Size Data." Interpolation<br><br><br>
of the 30th percentile relative to the Log(size) data results in a Log(D30) of 2.8542 and a D30 of 715 urn.<br>
Table Rimoved  <br>
The Relative and Absolute Jamming Onsets are determined in accordance with Method 6, "Jamming Onset." Data obtained from the test are provided in Table 7, "Jamming Onset Data." To obtain the dimensionless Relative Jamming Onset, the D30 particle size is converted to the same units as the orifice dimension. The required 25 mass% discharge falls between the dimensionless orifice size (b) of 5.59 and 6.99. Interpolation relative to the mass% discharged data results in a measured Relative Jamming Onset of 6.07 particles and an Absolute Jamming Onset of 4.34 millimeters. <br>

Example 13: Process for making a layered granule for automatic dishwashing detergent using spatially-separated binder and layering powder streams. The seed particle composition in Table IB column (p), made by a spray-drying process, is sieved to a particle size cut of between about 300 and 850 microns, using a Sweco 24" Vibro-Energy Round Separator. A mass of about 350 kg of the seed particles, with a bulk density of about 0.6 kg/liter is then dosed into a dual-axis counter-rotating paddle mixer (Bella™ B-1000XN), modified for binder addition using a distributor pipe located below the converging flow zone. The mixer is turned on, with two shafts counter-rotating at about 45 RPM. Each shaft has 14 paddles mounted in 7 pairs per shaft. A liquid mass of about 20 kg of linear alcohol alkoxylate, heated to obtain a viscosity of about 40 cp, is added via pressure spray nozzle into the top of the mixer at a rate of about 10 kg/minute so as to form atomized droplets and then contact said droplets with the fluidized seed particles in the center of the mixer. After the addition of the linear alcohol alkoxylate, a sequential combination of binders and layering powders is added to create an inner layer of comparatively hygroscopic chemistry surrounded by an outer layer of less hygroscopic material. The total layering time after the alkoxylate addition is about 8 minutes.<br>
The sequential layering powder addition includes two layering powders. A first layering powder of Table 2B column (x), added into the top of the mixer, split equally through two ingress ports located at diagonal corners of the mixer, directed over positions of downward paddle trajectory nearest to the end walls of the mixer, at a rate of about 45 kg/minute for 5 minutes. After the addition of the first layering powder is complete, a second layering powder of Table 2B column (p) is added through the same ingress ports at a rate of about 40 kg/minute for 3 minutes and 15 seconds.<br>
Concurrent with start of the layering powder additions, a sodium silicate binder solution of about 41 wt% solids is added through the bottom of the mixer by use of a 4-holed distributor bar, directing flow upwards into the converging flow zone, straddling the center three paddle positions. The sodium silicate solution is added at a rate of about 11 kg/minute for about 8 minutes.  Concurrent with the addition of the<br>
sodium silicate binder, an atomized spray of sodium polyacrylate polymer binder solution of about 32 wt% solids is added through nozzles mounted on the top-center of the mixer so as to contact binder droplets with the particles in the center of the mixer, where the seed particles are fluidized. The polymer solution is sprayed on at a rate of about 3 kg/minute for about 8 minutes.<br>
The resulting batch is discharged, screened to remove any oversize (&gt; 1.2 mm) and dried in a fluid bed with an air inlet temperature of about 130 C and an air flow of about 260 kg/minute for about 10 minutes. The product yield is about 90% accepts; the remainder is treated by milling and recycled either as seeds or layering powder.<br>
The Relative Jamming Onset of the accepted particulate is about 7.2 particles, and the product Rapid Stability Relative Jamming Onset is about 8.0 particles.<br>
Example 14: Continuous process for making a layered granule for automatic dishwashing<br>
detergent. The seed particle composition in Table IB column (s), made by a mechanical agglomeration process, is continuously sieved to a particle size cut of between about 420 and 1000 microns, using a multi-deck Mogensen Sizer®. The tailings from the sieving process are suitably recycled back to the agglomeration process. The classified seed material is added continuously into the primary inlet of a Lodige KM-600 mixer at a rate of about 650 kg/hour. The KM-600 mixer is fitted with ploughshare mixing elements rotating at a tip-speed of about 2 meters/second. Two high-speed choppers are located between plough positions along the axial direction of the mixer. A 41% aqueous solution of sodium silicate is added continuously to the KM-600 mixer through two pipe inlets beneath the chopper blades. The combined flow rate of the silicate solution is about 75 kg/hour. Sodium Carbonate Anhydrous powder is micronized using a Netzsch-Condux CUM 150 pin-mill to a form a fine layering powder, and then added continuously into the mixer at two locations above the choppers. The layering powder is added at a combined rate of about 275 kg/hour. The total throughput rate of the continuous layering process is about 1 metric ton/hour. The water in the silicate solution is substantially hydrated by the sodium carbonate layering powder. No further drying is required.<br><br>
