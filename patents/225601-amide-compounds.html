A suspension of 1-acetylpiperazine (0.627 g) , 2-chloro-4'-fluoroacetophenone (0.844 g), and potassium hydrogen carbonate (0.735 g) in acetonitrile (12 ml) was stirred at<br><br>
ambient temperature for 3 days.  After removal of the solid by filtration, the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a residue, which was chrorciatographed on silica gel (100 ml} eluting with 0%-5% methanol in dichloromethane.  The objective compound of the free form was taken up into ethyl acetate (2 ml) and to the solution was added a solution of hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate [^N, 2 ml).  The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with diisopropyl ether, and dried in vacuo to give l-acetyl-4-[4-fluorophenylcarbonylmethyl)-piperazine hydrochloride (1.47 g).<br>
