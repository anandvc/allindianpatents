				<td>HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF AN ASPERGILLUS KAWACHI ACID-STABLE<br>
ALPHA AMYLASE AND APPLICATIONS IN GRANULAR STARCH HYDROLYSIS<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/575,175, entitled Heterologous Expression of an Aspergillus kawachi Acid-Stable Alpha Amylase and Applications in Granular Starch Hydrolysis, filed May 27, 2004 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/605,437, entitled Heteroiogous Expression of an Aspergillus kawachi Acid-Stable Alpha Amylase and Applications in Granular Starch Hydrolysis, filed August 30, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an acid-stable alpha amylase (asAA) derived from a strain of Aspergillus kawachi, which has granular starch hydrolyzing (GSH) activity. Further the invention relates to the heterologous expression of an asAA having GSH activity in filamentous fungal host cells and particularly in Trichoderma and Aspergillus ceils and the use of asAA having GSH activity in compositions, which optionally include glucoamylases, to enhance starch hydrolysis and alcohol production.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucoamylases, and particularly glucoarnyiases having granular starch hydrolyzing (GSH) activity are important industriaf enzymes used for producing products such as organic acids (i.e. lactic acids), amino acids (i.e. glutamic acids), alcohols (i.e. ethanof) and other compounds from starch substrates derived from grains and cereals. During microbial fermentations, and particularly during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), it would be of benefit to reduce the amount of residual starch in the fermentation when granular starch substrates are used as a carbon feed. The present<br><br>
invention answers this need by providing an acid-stable alpha amylase (asAA) having granular starch hydrolyzing activity, which may be used in combination with a glucoamylase to enhance starch hydrolysis and alcohol production.<br>
Additionally, benefits of the present invention over prior art compositions and methods include one or more of the following: a) a reduction of thermal energy use during starch hydrolysis and-end-product production; b) reduction in the requirement of high enzyme dosage; c) utilization of a continuous internal glucose feed; d) maintenance of a relatively low glucose level in the fermenter, which significantly reduces the high risk of microbial contamination and removes the catabolite repression of yeast due to high concentration of free glucose; e) reduction in formation of browning reaction products; f)<br>
h<br>
reduction or removal of calcium addition, which was required during the prior art jet cooking process; g) reduction in water utilization during the fermentation process; h) use of higher solids content in the fermentation, which may result in higher end-product formation and reduced energy costs; i) reduced levels of production of certain byproducts, such as glycerol; and j) decreased residual starch content of distillers dry grains plus solubles.<br>

Singleton, etal., DICTIONARY OF MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, 2o ED., John Wifey and Sons, New York (1994) and Hale &amp; Markham, THE HARPER COLLINS DICTIONARY OF BIOLOGY, Harper Perennial, NY (1991) provide one of skill with general dictionaries of many of the terms used in this invention.<br><br>
Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail by way of reference only using the following definitions and examples. All patents and publications, including all sequences disclosed within such patents and publications, referred to herein are expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range.<br>
Unless othen.vise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5' to 3' orientation; amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation, respectively.<br>
The headings provided herein are not limitations of the various aspects or embodiments of the invention which can be had by reference to the specification as a whole.<br>
A.         Definitions<br>
As used herein the term "starch" refers to any material comprised of the complex polysaccharide carbohydrates of plants-, comprised of amylose and amylopectin with the formula (CtiHuA,),. therein X can be any number. In particular, the term refers to any plant-based material including but not limited to grains, grasses, tubers and roots and more specifically wheat, barley, corn, rye, rice, sorghum, brans, cassava, millet, potato, sweet potato, and tapioca.<br>
The term "granular starch" refers to raw (uncooked) starch, e.g., granular starch that has not been subject to gelatinization.<br>
The terms "granular starch hydrolyzing (GSH) enzyme" or "having granular starch hydrolyzing (GSH) activity" refer to enzymes, which have the ability to hydrolyze starch in granular form,<br>
The term "alpha-amylase (e.g., E.G. class 3.2.1.1)" refers to enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkages. These enzymes have also been described as those effecting the exo or endohydrolysis of 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides containing 1,4-a-linked D-glucose units. Another term used to describe these enzymes is "clycogenase". Exemplary enzymes include alpha-1,4-glucan 4-glucanohydrase glucanohydrolase.<br>
The term "acid-stable alpha amylase ("asAA") refers to an alpha amylase that is active in the pH range of pH 3.0 to 7.0 and preferably 3.5 to 6.0.<br><br>
The term "glucoamylase" refers to the amyloglucosidase class of enzymes (e.g., EC.3.2.1.3, glucoamylase, 1, 4-alpha-D-glucan glucohydrolase). These are exo-acting enzymes, which release glucosyl residues from the non-reducing ends of amylose and amylopectin molecules. The enzyme also hydrolyzes alpha-1, 6 and alpha -1,3 linkages although at much slower rate than alpha-1,4 linkages.<br>
The term "glycosylation" refers to the post-transcriptional modification of a protein by the addition of carbohydrate moieties, wherein the carbohydrate is either N-linked or O-linked resulting in a glucoprotein. An N-linked carbohydrate moiety of a glycoprotein is attached by a glycosidic bond to the p-amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue. An O-linked carbohydrate is attached by a glycosidic bond to a protein through the hydroxy group of a serine or a threonine residue.<br>
The term "recombinant" when used in reference to a cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.<br>
The terms "protein" and "polypeptide" are used interchangeably herein. The conventional one-letter or three-letter code for amino acid residues is used herein.<br>
A "signal sequence" means a sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of a protein, which facilitates the secretion of the mature form of the protein outside the cell. The definition of a signal sequence is a functional one. The mature form of the extracellular protein lacks the signal sequence which is cleaved off during the secretion process.<br>
The term "native acid-stable alpha amylase (n-asAA)" refers to an asAA produced from the endogenous expression of the asAA. For example, the term "n-asaA" means the endogenous expression of an acid-stable alpha amylase (i e, SEQ ID NO: 3) from an Aspergillus kawachi.<br>
The terms "recombinant acid-stable alpha amylase (r-asAA)", "recombinantly expressed asAA" and "recombinantly produced asAA" refer to a mature asAA protein sequence that is produced in a host cell from the expression of a heterologous polynucleotide. For example, the term "r-asaA" means the Aspergillus kawachi acid-stable alpha amylase (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 3) is expressed and produced in a host in which a polynucleotide encoding the asaA has been introduced. The mature protein sequence of a r-asAA excludes a signal sequence.<br><br>
A "gene" refers to a DMA segment that is involved in producing a polypeptkJe and includes regions preceding and following the coding regions as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).<br>
The term "nucleic acid" encompasses DMA, RNA, single stranded or double stranded and chemical modifications thereof. The terms "nucleic acid" and "polynucleotide" may be used interchangeably herein. Because the genetic code is degenerate, more than one codon may be used to encode a particular arriino acid, and the present invention encompasses polynucleotides, which encode a particular amino acid sequence.<br>
A "vector" refers to a polynucleotide sequence designed to introduce nucleic acids into one or more cell types. Vectors include cloning vectors, expression vectors, shuttle vectors, ptasmids, phage particles, cassettes and the like.<br>
An "expression vector" as used herein means a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting expression of the DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences may include a promoter to effect transcription, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable ribosome binding sites on the mRNA, enhancers and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation.<br>
A "promoter" is a regulatory sequence that is involved in binding RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of a gene. The promoter may be an inducible promoter or a constitutive promoter. A preferred promoter used in the invention is Trichoderma reesei cbhl, which is an inducible promoter.<br>
"Under transcriptional control" is a term well understood in the art that indicates that transcription of a polynucleotide sequence, usually a DNA sequence, depends on its being operably linked to an element which contributes to the initiation of, or promotes transcription.<br>
"Under translational control" is a term well understood in the art that indicates a regulatory process that occurs after mRNA has been formed.<br>
As used herein when describing proteins and genes that encode them, the term for the gene is italicized, (e.g., the gene that encodes asaA (A. kawachi asAA) may be denoted as asaA}. The term for the protein is generally not italicized and the first letter is generally capitalized, (e.g., the protein encoded by the asaA gene may be denoted as AsaA or asaA).<br>
The term "derived" encompasses the terms "originated from", "obtained" or "obtainable from", and "isolated from".<br><br>
The term "operably linked" refers to juxtaposition wherein the elements are in an arrangement allowing them to be functionally related. For example, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence.<br>
The term "selective marker" refers to a gene capable of expression in a host that allows for ease of selection of those hosts containing an introduced nucleic acid or vector. Examples of selectable markers include but are not limited to antimicrobials (e.g., hygromycin, bleomycin, or chloramphenicol) and/or genes that confer a metabolic advantage, such as a nutritional advantage on the host cell.<br>
A polynucleotide or a polypeptide having a certain percent (e.g. 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%) of sequence identity with another sequence means that, when aligned, that percentage of bases or arnino acid residues are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or identity can be determined using any suitable software program known in the art, for example those described in CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel et al. (eds) 1987, Supplement 30, section 7.7.18). Preferred programs include the GCG Pileup program, FASTA (Pearson et a/. (1988; Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci USA 85:2444-2448), and BLAST (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al., Natl. Cent. Biotechnol. Inf., Natl Lib. Med. (NCIB NLM NIH), Bethesda, MD, and Altschul et al., (1997) NAR 25:3389-3402). Another preferred alignment program is ALIGN Plus (Scientific and Educational Software, PA), preferably using default parameters. Another sequence software program that finds use is the TFASTA Data Searching Program available in the Sequence Software Package Version 6.0 (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wl).<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that sequences encompassed by the invention are also defined by the ability to hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions with the exemplified asaA sequence (e. g., SEQ ID NO:1). A nucleic acid is hybridizable to another nucleic acid sequence when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid can anneal to the other nucleic acid under appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength. Hybridization and washing conditions are well known in the art (See, e.g., Sambrook (1989) supra, particularly chapters 9 and 11). In some embodiments, stringent conditions correspond to a Tm of 65Â°C and 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS.<br>
"Host strain" or "host cell" means a suitable host for an expression vector or DNA construct comprising a polynucleotide encoding a granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme according to the invention. Specifically, host strains are preferably filamentous fungal cells. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, "host cell" means both the cells and<br><br>
protoplasts created from the cells of a filamentous fungal strain and particularly a Trichoderma sp. or an Aspergillus sp.<br>
The term "filamentous fungi" refers to ail filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycotina (See, ASexopoulos, C. J. (1962), INTRODUCTORY MYCOLOGY, Wiley, New York). These fungi are characterized by a vegetative mycelium with a cell wall composed of chitin, cellulose, and other complex polysaccharides. The filamentous fungi of the present invention are morphologically, physiologically, and genetically distinct from yeasts. Vegetative growth by filamentous fungi is by hyphal elongation and carbon cataboiism is obligatory aerobic. In the present invention, the filamentous fungal parent cell may be a eel! of a species of, but not limited to, Trichoderma, (e.g., Trichoderma reesei (previously classified as T. longibrachiatum and currently also known as Hypocreajecohna). Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma harzianum); Penicillium sp., Humicola sp. (e.g., Humicola insolens and Humicola grisea); Chrysosporium sp. (e.g., C. lucknowense), Glioctadium sp., Aspergillus sp. (e.g., A. oryzae, A. niger, and A. awamori), Fusarium sp., Neurospora sp., Hypocrea sp., and Emericella sp. (See also, Innis et a/., (1985) Sci. 228:21 -26).<br>
As used herein, the term "Trichoderma" or "Trichoderma sp." refer to any fungal genus previously or currently classified as Trichoderma.<br>
The term "culturing" refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium.

preferred plant sources include corn; wheat; rye; sorghum; rice; millet; barley; cassava; legumes, such as beans and peas; potatoes; sweet potatoes; bananas; and tapioca.<br>
Specifically contemplated starch substrates are cornstarch and wheat starch. The starch from a grain may be ground or whole and includes corn solids, such as kernels, bran and/or cobs. The starch may be highly refined raw starch or feedstock from starch refinery processes. Those of general skill in the art are well aware of available methods which may be used to prepare granular starch substrates for use in the methods encompassed by the invention. Some of these methods include dry milling of whole cereal grains using hammer mills and roller mills and wet milling.<br>

In other embodiments, the asAA comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or an amino acid sequence having at least 95% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 3 is encoded by a polynucleotide having at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 93%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% and at least 99% sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the asAA of SEQ ID NO: 3 (AsaA) is the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
As understood by those in the art, the quantity of asAA having GSH activity used in the compositions and methods of the present invention will depend on the enzymatic activity of the asAA.<br>
In general, asAA having GSH activity will be mixed with a slurry of a granular starch substrate in an amount of about 0.01 to 15.0 SSU per gram of dry solids content of the slurry.

Glucoarnylases -<br>
Glucoamylases (GA) may be derived from bacteria, plants and fungi sources. Preferred glucoamylases useful in the compositions and methods of the invention are produced by several strains of filamentous fungi and yeast. In particular, glucoamylases secreted from strains of Aspergillus and Trichoderma are commercially important. Sources of these glucoamylases include: Aspergillus niger G1 and G2 glucoamylase and variants thereof (Boel et al., (1984) EMBO J. 3:1097 -1102; WO 92/00381 and WO 00/04136); Aspergillus awamori glucoamylases (WO 84/02921); Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase and variants thereof (Hata et al., (1991) Agric. Biol. Chem.. 55:941 - 949) and Aspergillus shirousami. (See Chen et al., (1996) Prot. Bng. 9:499 - 505; Chen et al. (1995) Prot. Eng. 8:575-582; and Chen et al., (1994) Biochem J. 302:275-281). Glucoarnylases are also obtained from strains of Talaromyces such as those derived from T. emersonii, T. leycettanus, T. duponti and T. thermophilus (WO 99/28488; USP No. RE: 32,153; USP No. 4,587,215); strains of Rhizopus, such as R. niveusand R. oryzae; strains of Mucor and Humicola, such as H. grisea (See, Boel ef al., (1984)<br><br>
EMBO J, 3:1097-1102; WO 92/00381; WO 00/04136; Chen et a/., (1996) Prof. Eng. 9:499-505; Taylor et a/., (1978) Carbohydrate Res. 61:301-308; US Pat. No. 4,514,496; US Pat. No. 4,092,434; and Jensen et al., (1988) Can. J. Microbiol. 34:218-223).<br>
Enzymes having glucoamylase activity used commercially are produced for example, from Aspergillus niger (trade name DISTILLASE, OPTIDEX L-400 and G ZYME G990 4X from Genencor International Inc.) or Rhizopus species (trade name CU.CONC from Shin Nihon Chemicals, Japan). Also the commercial digestive enzyme, trade name GLUCZYME from Amano Pharmaceuticals, Japan (Takahashi et al., (1985) J. Biochem. 98:663-671). Additional enzymes include three forms of glucoamylase (E.C.3.2.1.3) of a Rhizopus sp., namely "Glud" (MW 74,000), "Gluc2" (MW 58,600) and "GlucS" (MW 61,400). Glud finds particular use in the present invention.<br>
As understood by those in the art, the quantity of glucoamylase used in the method and compositions of the present invention depends on the enzymatic activity of the glucoamylase. Generally, an amount of between 0.001 and 10.0 GAU of glucoamylase per gram (ds) slurry adjusted to 20 - 45% dry solids may be added. In some embodiments, the glucoamylase is added in an amount between 0.01 and 10 GAU; between 0.01 and 5.0 GAU; between 0.05 and 5.0 GAU: between 0.1 and 10.0 GAU; between 0.1 and 5.0 GAU; between 0.1 and 2.0 GAU; between 0.25 and 1.5 GAU of glucoamylase per gram (ds) slurry. In one preferred embodiment, the dosage range for glucoamylase will be from 0.1 to 2.0 GAU/g (ds) slurry.<br>
A particular group of glucoamylase (GA) enzymes are known as granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme(s) GSHE (See e.g., Tosi et al., (1993) Can. J. Microbiol. 39:846 -855). GA-GSHEs not only have glucoamylase activity, but also are able to hydrolyze granular (raw) starch. GA-GSHEs have been recovered from fungal cells such as Humicola sp., Aspergillus sp. and Rhizopus sp. A Rhizopus oryzae GA-GSHE has been described in Ashikari et al., (1986) Agric. Biol. Chem. 50:957-964 and USP 4,863,864. Also reference is made to Rhizopus niveus. A Humicola grisea GA-GSHE is described by Allison et al., (1992) Curr. Genet. 21:225-229 and European Patent No., 171218. The gene encoding this enzyme is also known in the art as Mg/a1". An Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi GA-GSHE is described by Hayashida et al., (1989) Agric. Biol. Chem 53:923-929. An Aspergillus shirousami GA-GSHE is described by Shibuya et al., (1990) Agric. Biol. Chem. 54:1905-1914. One particular GA-GSHE preparation for use in the present invention includes enzyme preparations sold under the designation "M1" available from Biocon India, Ltd, India. The activity of a GA-GSHE preparation may be defined in terms of the glucoamylase activity.<br><br>
In one embodiment, a GA-GSHE enzyme may be derived from a strain of Humicola grisea, particularly a strain of H. or/sea var. thermoidea (See, US Pat. No. 4,618,579). In some preferred embodiments, the Humicola grisea GA-GSHE enzyme is recovered from fungi including ATCC 16453, NRRL (USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, ILL) 15219, NRRL 15220, NRRL 15221, NRRL 15222, NRRL 15223, NRRL 15224 and NRRL 15225, as well as genetically altered strains thereof. These species produce enzymatic glucoamylase preparations that are immunologically the same (See, EP 0171 218).<br>
Recombinantly expressed enzymes -<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, microorganisms are genetically engineered to express heteroiogous asAA having GSH activity and microorganisms may also be engineered to express heteroiogous glucoamylases. Preferred host cells are filamentous fungal cells. In a preferred embodiment, the filamentous fungal host is a strain of an Aspergillus sp, a Trichoderma sp, a Fusarium sp and a Penicillium sp. Particularly preferred fungal host cells include A. nidulans, A. awamori, A. oryzae, A. aculeatus, A. niger, A. japonicus, 7 reesei, T. viride, F. oxysporum, and F. so/an/. Aspergillus strains are disclosed in Ward et al. (1993) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 39:738-743 and Goedegebuur et al., (2002) Curr Gene 41:89 - 98. In a most preferred embodiment, the host is a strain of Trichoderma, and particularly a strain of T. reesei. Strains of 7. reesei are known and nonlimiting examples include ATCC No. 13631, ATCC No. 26921, ATCC No. 56764, ATCC No. 56765, ATCC No. 56767 and NRRL 15709. In some preferred embodiments, the host strain is a derivative of RL-P37. RL-P37 is disclosed in Sheir-Neiss ef al. (1984) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnology 20:46 - 53.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, a Trichoderma host cell or an Aspergillus host cell is genetically engineered to express an asAA having GSH activity characterized by an amino acid sequence having at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% and 99% identity with SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding an asAA will have a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a nucleic acid sequence having at least 70% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
In some embodiments, the asAA produced in a host cell engineered to include a heteroiogous polynucleotide encoding an asAA having GSH activity will have different, such as improved properties compared to the asAA produced by the endogenous expression of the asAA having GSH activity in a native host. These properties may include for example, increased enzyme activity, increased enzyme stability at lower pH levels or increased specific activity.<br><br>
In other embodiments, the host strain which is genetically engineered to express an asAA having GSH activity may also be genetically engineered to express a heterologous GA.<br>
The host strain may have been previously manipulated through genetic engineering. In some embodiments, various native genes of the fungal host cell will have been inactivated. These genes include, for example genes encoding cellulolytic enzymes, such as endoglucanases (EG) and exocellobiohydrolases (CBH) (e.g. cbr)1, cbh2, eg/1, eg/2 and eg/3). US Patent No. 5,650,322 discloses derivative strains of RIPS? having deletions in the cbhl gene and the cbh2 gene.<br>
Vectors -<br>
While the description below refers specifically to asAA, one skilled in the art will readily understand that the same or similar methods apply to DMA constructs and vectors useful for introduction of a polynucleotide encoding GA into a host cell.<br>
According to the invention, a DNA construct comprising nucleic acid encoding an asAA encompassed by the invention is constructed to transfer an asAA into a host cell. In one embodiment, the DNA construct is transferred to a host cell by an expression vector which comprises regulatory sequences operably linked to an asAA coding sequence.<br>
The vector may be any vector which when introduced into a fungal host cell is integrated into the host cell genome and is replicated. Reference is made to the Fungal Genetics Stock Center Catalogue of Strains (FGSC, ) for a list of vectors. Additional examples of suitable expression and/or integration vectors are provided in Sambrook el a/., (1989) supra, Ausubel (1987) supra, van den Hondel ef a/. (1991) in Bennett and Lasure (Eds.) MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press pp. 396-428 and U.S. Patent No. 5,874,276. Particularly useful vectors include pFB6, pBR322, PUC18, pUC100 and pENTR/D.<br>
In preferred embodiments, nucleic acid encoding an asAA encompassed by the invention is operably linked to a suitable promoter, which shows transcriptional activity in the fungal host cell. The promoter may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host ceil. Preferably, the promoter is useful in a Trichoderma host. Suitable nonlimiting examples of promoters include cbh~\, cbh2, eg/1, eg!2. In one embodiment, the promoter is one that is native to the host cell. For example, when T. reesei is the host, the promoter is a native T. reesei promoter. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is T. reesei cbhl, which is an inducible promoter and has been deposited in GenBank under Accession No. D86235. An "inducible promoter* is a<br><br>
promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. In another embodiment, the promoter is one that is heterologous to the fungal host cell. Other examples of useful promoters include promoters from A. atvamor/and A. niger glucoamylase genes (Nunberg et a/., (1984) Mol. Cell Biol. 4:2306-2315 and Boel et al., (1984) EMBO J. 3:1581-1585). Also, the promoters of the T. reesei x/r?1 gene and the cellobiohydrolase 1 gene may be useful (EPA 137280A1).<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the asAA coding sequence is operably linked to a signal sequence. The DNA encoding the signal sequence is preferably that which is naturally associated with the asAA gene to be expressed. Preferably, the signal sequence is encoded by an Aspergillus kawachiasaA gene that encodes an Ak-asaA. More preferably the signal sequence has at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, and at least 99% sequence identity to the signal sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. In additional embodiments, a signal sequence and a promoter sequence comprising a DNA construct or vector to be introduced into a fungal host cell are derived from the same source. For example, in some embodiments, the signal sequence is the cd/71 signal sequence which is operably linked to a cdfr\ promoter.<br>
In some embodiments, the expression vector also includes a termination sequence. In one embodiment, the termination sequence and the promoter sequence are derived from the same source. In another embodiment, the termination sequence is homologous to the host cell. A particularly suitable terminator sequence is cbh"\ derived from a Trichoderma strain and particularly T. reesei. Other useful fungal terminators include the terminator from A. niger or A. awamori glucoamylase gene (Nunberg et al, (1984) supra, and Boel et al., (1984) supra).<br>
In some embodiments, an expression vector includes a selectable marker. Examples of preferred selectable markers include ones which confer antimicrobial resistance (e.g., hygromycin and phleomycin). Nutritional selective markers also find use in the present invention including those markers known in the art as amdS argB and pyr4. Markers useful in vector systems for transformation of Trichoderma are known in the art (See, e.g., Finkelstein, chapter 6 in BIOTECHNOLOGY OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Finkelstein et al. Eds. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA (1992), Chap. 6.; and Kinghorn et al. (1992) APPLIED MOLECULAR GENETICS OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Blackie Academic and Professional, Chapman and Hall, London). In a preferred embodiment, the selective marker is the amcfS gene, which encodes the enzyme acetamidase, allowing transformed cells to grow on acetamide as a nitrogen source. The use of A. nidulans amdS gene as a selective marker is described in Kelley et al., (1985) EMBO J. 4:475 - 479 and Penttila et al., (1987) Gene 61:155-164.<br><br>
An expression vector comprising a DMA construct with a polynucleotide encoding an asAA may be any vector which is capable of replicating autonomously in a given fungal host organism or of integrating into the DMA of the host. In some embodiments, the expression vector is a plasmid. In preferred embodiments, two types of expression vectors for obtaining expression of genes are contemplated.<br>
The first expression-vector comprises DNA sequences in which the promoter, asAA coding region, and terminator all originate from the gene to be expressed. In some embodiments, gene truncation is obtained by deleting undesired DNA sequences (e.g., DNA encoding unwanted domains) to leave the domain to be expressed under control of its own transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences.<br>
The second type of expression vector is preassembled and contains sequences required for high-level transcription and a selectable marker. In some embodiments, the coding region for an asAA gene or part thereof is inserted into this general-purpose expression vector such that it is under the transcriptional control of the expression construct promoter and terminator sequences. In some embodiments, genes or part thereof are inserted downstream of the strong cb/7l promoter.<br>
Methods used to ligate the DNA construct comprising a polynucleotide encoding an asAA, a promoter, a terminator and other sequences and to insert them into a suitable vector are well known in the art. Linking is generally accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. (See, Sambrook (1989) supra, and Bennett and Lasure, MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press, San Diego (1991) pp 70 - 76.). Additionally, vectors can be constructed using known recombination techniques (e.g., Invitrogen Life Technologies, Gateway Technology).<br>
Where it is desired to obtain a fungal host cell having one or more inactivated genes known methods may be used (e.g. methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,246,853, U.S. Patent No. 5,475,101 and WO92/06209). Gene inactivation may be accomplished by complete or partial deletion, by insertional inactivation or by any other means which renders a gene nonfunctional for its intended purpose (such that the gene is prevented from expression of a functional protein). Any gene from a Trichoderma sp or other filamentous fungal host, which has been cloned can be deleted, for example cbM, cbh2, eg/1 and eg/2 genes. In some embodiments, gene deletion may be accomplished by inserting a form of the desired gene to be inactivated into a plasmid by methods known in the art. The deletion plasmid is then cut at an appropriate restriction enzyme site(s), internal to the desired gene coding region, and the gene coding sequence or part thereof is replaced with a selectable marker. Flanking DNA sequences<br><br>
from the locus of the gene to be deleted (preferably between about 0.5 to 2.0kb) remain on either side of the marker gene. An appropriate deletion plasmid will generally have unique restriction enzyme sites present therein to enable the fragment containing the deleted gene, including the flanking DMA sequences and the selectable markers gene to be removed as a single linear piece.<br>
Transformation, expression and culture of host cells -<br>
Introduction of a DNA construct or vector into a host cell includes techniques such as transformation; eiectroporation; nuclear microinjection; transduction; transfection, (e.g., lipofection mediated and DEAE-Dextrin mediated transfection); incubation with calcium phosphate DNA precipitate; high velocity bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles; and protoplast fusion. General transformation techniques are known in the art (See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (1987), supra, chapter 9; and Sambrook (1989) supra, and Campbell et al., (1989) Curr. Genet. 16:53-56). The expression of heterologous protein in Trichoderma is described in USP 6,022,725; U.S.Pat. No. 6,268,328; Harkki et al. (1991); Enzyme Microb. Technol. 13:227-233; Harkki et al., (1989) Bio Technol. 7:596-603; EP 244,234; EP 215,594; and Nevalainen et al., "The Molecular Biology of Trichoderma and its Application to the Expression of Both Homologous and Heterologous Genes", in MOLECULAR INDUSTRIAL MYCOLOGY, Eds. Leong and Berka, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY (1992) pp. 129 -148). Reference is also made to Cao et al., (2000) Sci. 9:991 -1001 for transformation of Aspergillus strains.<br>
Preferably, genetically stable transformants are constructed with vector systems whereby the nucleic acid encoding an asAA is stably integrated into a host strain chromosome. Transformants are then purified by known techniques.<br>
In one nonlimiting example, stable transformants including an amcfS marker are distinguished from unstable transformants by their faster growth rate and the formation of circular colonies with a smooth, rather than ragged outline on solid culture medium containing acetamide. Additionally, in some cases a further test of stability is conducted by growing the transformants on solid non-selective medium (i.e., medium that lacks acetamide), harvesting spores from this culture medium and determining the percentage of these spores which subsequently germinate and grow on selective medium containing acetamide. Alternatively, other methods known in the art may be used to select transformants.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the preparation of Trichoderma sp. for transformation involves the preparation of protoplasts from fungal mycelia. (See, Campbell et a/.,(1989) Curr. Genet. 16:53-56). In some embodiments, the mycelia are<br><br>
obtained from germinated vegetative spores. The mycelia are treated with an enzyme that digests the cell wall resulting in protoplasts. The protoplasts are then protected by the presence of an osmotic stabilizer in the suspending medium. These stabilizers include sorbitol, mannitol, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate and the like. Usually the concentration of these stabilizers varies between 0.8 M and 1.2 M. It is preferable to use about a 1.2 M solution of sorbitol in the suspension medium.<br>
Uptake of DMA into the host Trichoderma sp. strain is dependent upon the calcium ion concentration. Generally, between about 10 mM CaCI2 and 50 mM CaC^ is used in an uptake solution. Besides the need for the calcium ion in the uptake solution, other compounds generally included are a buffering system such as TE buffer (10 Mm Trisi pH 7.4; 1 mM EDTA) or 10 mM MOPS, pH 6.0 buffer (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). It is believed that the polyethylene glycol acts to fuse the cell membranes, thus permitting the contents of the medium to be delivered into the cytoplasm of the Trichoderma sp. strain and the plasmid DNA is transferred to the nucleus. This fusion frequently leaves multiple copies of the plasmid DNA integrated into the host chromosome.<br>
Usually a suspension containing the Trichoderma sp. protoplasts or cells that have been subjected to a permeability treatment at a density of 105 to 107/rnL, preferably 2 x 106/mL are used in transformation. A volume of 100 uL of these protoplasts or cells in an appropriate solution (e.g., 1.2 M sorbitol; 50 mM CaCI2) are mixed with the desired DNA. Generally a high concentration of PEG is added to the uptake solution.  From 0.1 to 1 volume of 25% PEG 4000 can be added to the protoplast suspension. However, it is preferable to add about 0.25 volumes to the protoplast suspension. Additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide, heparin, spermidine, potassium chloride and the like may also be added to the uptake solution and aid in transformation. Similar procedures are available for other fungal host cells. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,022,725 and 6,268,328, both of which are incorporated by reference).<br>
Generally, the mixture is then incubated at approximately 0Â°C for a period of between 10 to 30 minutes. Additional PEG is then added to the mixture to further enhance the uptake of the desired gene or DNA sequence. The 25% PEG 4000 is generally added in volumes of 5 to 15 times the volume of the transformation mixture; however, greater and lesser volumes may be suitable. The 25% PEG 4000 is preferably about 10 times the volume of the transformation mixture. After the PEG is added, the transformation mixture is then incubated either at room temperature or on ice before the addition of a sorbitol and CaCI2 solution. The protoplast suspension is then further<br><br>
added to molten aliquots of a growth medium. This growth medium permits the growth of transformants only.<br>
Generally, cells are cultured in a standard medium containing physiological salts and nutrients (See, e.g., Pourquie, J. et a/., BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS OF CELLULOSE DEGRADATION, eds. Aubert, J. P. et al., Academic Press, pp. 71-86,1988 and llmen, M. etal., (1997)/App/. Environ. Microbiol. 63:1298-1306). Common commercially prepared media (e.g., Yeast Malt Extract (YM) broth, Luria Bertani (LB) broth and Sabouraud Dextrose (SD) broth) also find use in the present invention.<br>
Culture conditions are also standard, (e.g., cultures are incubated at approximately 28 Â°C in appropriate medium in shake cultures or fermenters until desired levels of asAA expression are achieved). Preferred culture conditions for a given filamentous fungus are known in the art and may be found in the scientific literature and/or from the source of the fungi such as the American Type Culture Collection and Fungal Genetics Stock Center.<br>
After fungal growth has been established, the cells are exposed to conditions effective to cause or permit the expression of an asAA as defined herein. In cases where an asAA having GSH activity coding sequence is under the control of an inducible promoter, the inducing agent (e.g.,-a sugar, metal salt or antimicrobial), is added to the medium at a concentration effective to induce asAA expression.<br>
Identification of asAA Activity -<br>
In order to evaluate the expression of an asAA having GSH activity by a cell line that has been transformed with a heterologous polynucleotide encoding an asaA encompassed by the invention, assays can be carried out at the protein level, the RNA level or by use of functional bioassays particular to alpha amylase activity and/or production. In general assays employed include, Northern blotting, dot blotting (DMA or RNA analysis), RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe (based on the nucleic acid coding sequence) and conventional Southern blotting and autoradiography.<br>
In addition, the production and/or expression of an asAA having GSH activity may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by assays directly measuring reducing sugars such as glucose in the culture media and by assays for measuring glucoamylase activity, expression and/or production. Substrates useful for assaying GSH activity include granular starch substrates. For example, glucose concentration may be determined by any convenient method such as by using glucose reagent kit No 15-UV (Sigma Chemical Co.) or an instrument such as Technicon Autoanalyzer. Also<br><br>
reference is made to glucose oxidase kits and glucose hexose kits commercially available from Instrumentation Lab. (Lexington, MA).<br>
In addition, gene expression, may be evaluated by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells, tissue sections or immunoassay of tissue culture medium, e.g., by Western blot or ELISA. Such immunoassays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate expression of an asaA. The details of such methods are known to those of skill in the art and many reagents for practicing such methods are commercially available.<br>
In addition, gene expression, may be evaluated by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells, tissue sections or immunoassay of tissue culture medium, e.g., by Western blot or ELISA. Such immunoassays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate expression of a asAA. The details of such methods are known to those of skill in the art and many reagents for practicing such methods are commercially available.<br>
Alpha arnylase activity may be measured by using the DNS method as described in Miller, G. L. (1959) Anal. Chem, 31:426 - 428. Glucoamylase activity may be assayed by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (See, Goto et al., (1994) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 58:49-54).<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the asAA having GSH activity expressed by a Trichoderma or Aspergillus host will be greater than 1 gram protein per liter (g/L), greater than 2 g/L, greater than 5 g/L, greater than 10 g/L, greater than 20 g/L, greater than 25 g/L, greater than 30 g/L, greater than 50 g/L and also greater than 100 g/L of culture media.<br>
Methods for Purifying asAA -<br>
In general, an asaA (including n-asAA or r-asAA) produced in cell culture is secreted into the medium and may be purified or isolated, e.g., by removing unwanted components from the cell culture medium. In some cases, an AsaA may be produced in a cellular form necessitating recovery from a cell lysate. In such cases the enzyme is purified from the cells in which it was produced using techniques routinely employed by those of skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography (Tilbeurgh et al., (1984) FEBS Lett. 16:215); ion-exchange chromatographic methods (Goyal et al., (1991) Biores. Technol. 36:37; Fliess et al., (1983) Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 17:314; Bhikhabhai et al., (1984) J. Appl. Biochem. 6:336; and Ellouz et al., (1987) Chromatography 396:307), including ion-exchange using materials with high resolution power (Medve et al., (1998) J. Chromatography A 808:153; hydrophobia<br><br>
interaction chromatography (Tomaz and Queiroz, (1999) J. Chromatography A 865:123; two-phase partitioning (Brumbauer, et a/., (1999)B/oseparaf/on 7:287); ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; and gel filtration using, e.g., Sephadex G-75.<br>
Fermentations -<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, fungal cells expressing a heterologous glucoamylase and/or asAA are grown under batch or continuous fermentation conditions. A classical batch fermentation is a closed system, wherein the composition of the medium is set at the beginning of the fermentation and is not subject to artificial alterations during the fermentation. Thus, at the beginning of the fermentation the medium is inoculated with the desired organism(s). In this method, fermentation is permitted to occur without the addition of any components to the system. Typically, a batch fermentation qualifies as a "batch" with respect to the addition of the carbon source and attempts are often made at controlling factors such as pH and oxygen concentration. The metabolite and biomass compositions of the batch system change constantly up to the time the fermentation is stopped. Within batch cultures, cells progress through a static lag phase to a high growth log phase and finally to a stationary phase where growth rate is diminished or halted. If untreated, cells in the stationary phase eventually die. In general, cells in log phase are responsible for the bulk of production of end product.<br>
A variation on the standard batch system is the "fed-batch fermentation" system, which also finds use with the present invention. In this variation of a typical batch system, the substrate is added in increments as the fermentation progresses. Fed-batch systems are useful when catabolite repression is apt to inhibit the metabolism of the cells and where it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the medium. Measurement of the actual substrate concentration in fed-batch systems is difficult and is therefore estimated on the basis of the changes of measurable factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen and the partial pressure of waste gases such as COg. Batch and fed-batch fermentations are common and well known in the art.<br>
Continuous fermentation is an open system where a defined fermentation medium is added continuously to a bioreactor and an equal amount of conditioned medium is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous fermentation generally maintains the cultures at a constant high density where cells are primarily in log phase growth.<br><br>
Continuous fermentation allows for the modulation of one factor or any number of factors that affect cell growth and/or end product concentration. For example, in one embodiment, a limiting nutrient such as the carbon source or nitrogen source is maintained at a fixed rate an all other parameters are allowed to moderate. In other systems, a number of factors affecting growth can be altered continuously while the cell concentration, measured by media turbidity, is kept constant. Continuous systems strive to maintain steady state growth conditions. Thus, cell loss due to medium being drawn off must be balanced against the cell growth rate in the fermentation. Methods of modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous fermentation processes as well as techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art of industrial microbiology.<br>
Compositions and Methods -<br>
In one embodiment, a granular starch substrate is contacted with an asAA having GSH activity, wherein the asAA is available as a cell free filtrate (for example wherein the asAA is isolated from a culture medium). In another embodiment, the granular starch substrate is contacted with an asAA having GSH activity, wherein the asAA is available in a culture medium containing the fungal host cells which express and secret the asAA having GSH activity.<br>
In other embodiments, the granular starch substrate is contacted in the same step with both an asAA having GSH activity and a glucoamylase (GA) to hydrolyze the granular starch. The GA may also be available as a cell free filtrate or in the culture medium containing host cells that express and secrete the GA.<br>
A particularly useful granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme composition, according to the invention includes a mixture of GA (e.g., DISTALLASEÂ®) and an asAA having at least 90% or at least 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3. In some embodiments, the range of asAA present in this mixture measured as activity is from 0.01 to 15.0 SSL), and the amount of glucoamaylase useful in this combination is in the range of 0.1 to 10.0 GAU/g ds.<br>
A particularly useful enzymatic composition includes a mixture of an asAA having at least 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 and a GA having 0.1 to 10 GAU/g ds. Another particularly useful enzymatic composition includes a mixture of an asAA having at least 98% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3 and a GA having 0.1 to 10 GAU/g ds.<br>

The slurry may have about 10 - 50% ds; about 10 - 45%; about 15 - 40%; about 20 - 40%; about 25 - 40%; or about 25 - 35% ds.<br>
The exact amounts of the components encompassed by the composition and methods of the invention depend on the combination of enzymes applied as well as the type of granular starch processed.<br>
In some embodiments the invention relates to a method of producing an end-product comprising contacting a slurry of a granular starch substrate with a combination of enzymes including glucoamylase and an acid stable alpha amylase (asAA) having granular starch (GSH) activity in one-step to produce the end-product. In some embodiments, the asAA and GA will be added separately and in other embodiments, the asAA and GA will be added in a combination blend. In a preferred embodiment, the contacting step is conducted at a temperature below the starch gelatinization temperature of the granular starch.<br>
The exact temperature used in accordance with the methods of the invention depends upon the specific starch substrate used. General starch gelatinization temperature ranges are disclosed in Swinkels pages 32 - 38 in STARCH CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY, eds Van Beynum et at., (1985) Marcel Dekker Inc., NY and THE ALCOHOL TEXTBOOK, A REFERENCE FOR THE BEVERAGE, FUEL AND INDUSTRIAL ALCOHOL INDUSTRIES, 3rd Ed., eds Jacques et al., 1999, Nottingham University Press, UK. In some embodiments the temperature will be least about 10Â°C, 15Â°C, 20Â°C, 25Â°C, 30Â°C, 35Â°C, 40"C, 45Â°C, 50Â°C, 55Â°C, 60Â°C, and 65Â°C. In other embodiments, the temperature will be between about 30 - 65Â°C, about 35 - 65Â°C, about 40 - 65Â°C, and about 45 - 65Â°C. In other embodiments, the temperature will be between about 25 - 45Â°C, about 25 -40Â°C and about 30 - 35Â°C. In preferred embodiments, the starch substrate is never subjected to the thermal conditions used for liquefactions.<br>
In some embodiments, the residence time of the method is from about 2 to 300 hrs, but more typically from 2 to 120 hours. In some embodiments, the process is conducted from about 5 to 100 hours. In other embodiments, the process is conducted from about 5 to 80 hours. In still other embodiments, the process is conducted for at least 5 hours but less than 100 hours. In other embodiments, the process is conducted for at least about 10 hours but less than about 100 hours.<br><br>
In some embodiments, at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% and 99% of the dry solids of the granular starch is hydrolyzed. In some embodiments, the granular starch substrate is completely hydrolyzed. In some embodiments, at least 90% of the granular starch is hydrolyzed in 100 hours. In certain embodiments, at least 90% of the granular starch substrate is hydrolyzed in a time period of 24 hours. In other embodiments, at least 95% of the granular starch substrate is hydrolyzed in a time period of 24 hours'.<br>
The yield of glucose (percent of the total solubilized dry solids) may be at least about 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97% and 98%. However, in a preferred embodiment, the glucose is continually produced and substantially ail of the glucose is used in the process to produce an end-product, such as ethanol. (Reference is made to MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF FOOD CARBOHYDRATE, ED. G.G. BIRCH ET AL , APPLIED SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, LONDON).<br>
Additional enzymes may be included in the compositions and methods encompassed by the invention. These additional enzymes, which find use in the present invention include debranching enzymes such as pullulanases (E.G. 3.2.1.41) and isoamylases (E.G. 3.2.1.68). Such enzymes hydrolyze alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds. Thus, during the hydrolysis of the starch, debranching enzymes remove successive glucose units from the non-reducing ends of the starch.<br>
Another enzyme that may be used in the compositions of the invention are beta-amylases (E.G. 3.2.1.2). These are exo-acting maltogenic amylases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of 1,4-alpha-glucosidic linkages in amylose, amylopectin and related glucose polymers. The enzymes are characterized as having an optimum pH range from 4.5 to 7.0 and optimum temperature range from 40Â°C to 65Â°C. Commercial beta-amylases are available from Genencor International Inc.<br>
Further additional enzymes which may be used are proteases, such as fungal and bacterial proteases. Fungal proteases include for example, those obtained from Aspergillus, Mucor and Rhizopus, such as A. niger, A. awamori, A. oryzae and M. miehei. Other enzymes include but are not limited to cellulases, hemicellulases, lipases and cutinases.<br>
The effective amount of these enzymes to be included in the methods of the invention can be readily determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, an antimicrobial may be added to the compositions and fermentation medium of the invention. Antimicrobials are compounds that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the granular starch substrate may be pretreated prior to contacting with the asAA and optionally the GA. Pretreatment includes heating a granular starch substrate, preferably a slurry containing the raw substrate to a temperature below the starch gelatinization temperature of the starch substrate prior to the fermentation or culturing with an enthanologenic microorganism. In preferred embodiments, the pretreatment will include the use of an alpha amylase, such as a bacterial alpha amylase (i.e., SPEZYME and GZYME 997 (Genencor International, Inc.)).<br>
In some embodiments, the pretreatment will be included in the culture with an asAA having GSH activity according to the invention and optionally with a glucoamylase. In other embodiments, the pretreatment will be separate from the culture which includes the asAA having GSH activity and optionally the glucoamylase. In some embodiments the pretreatment will take place from about 2-24 hours. In other embodiments, the pretreatment will take place from about 2 to 8 hours.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the method comprises a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), wherein the granular starch hydrolysis step and a fermentation step are carried out contemporaneously. The culture medium, which includes the granular starch substrate contacted with asAA having GSH activity, either supplied in a cell free filtrate or expressed from a fungal host cell in the culture, will also include microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungal or yeast and particularly ethanolgenic microorganisms. In some embodiments, the fermentation system may include at least two cell cultures. In some preferred embodiments, the SSF will include contacting the granular starch substrate with a glucoamylase in addition to the asAA having GSH activity.<br>
In some preferred embodiments the ethanologenic microorganisms will include yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (US Pat. No. 4,316,956). Preferred examples of ethanologenic microorganisms also include bacteria expressing alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase such as can be obtained with or from Zymomonas moblis (US Pat, Nos. 5,028,539; 5,424,202; 5,487,989; 5,482,846; 5,554,520; and 5,514,583). In additional embodiments, the ethanologenic microorganisms express xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase, enzymes that convert xylose to xylulose. Commercial sources of yeast include FALI; RED STAR (Red Star); FERMIOL (DSM Specialties) and SUPERSTART (Alltech).<br>
In some embodiments, the residence time for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation will be from about 2 to 300 hours, but preferably from 2 to 120 hours. In some embodiments, the time is from about 5 to 100 hours. In other embodiments, the<br><br>
time is from about 5 to 80 hours. In still other embodiments, the time is for at least 5 hours but less than 100 hours. In other embodiments, the process time is for at least about 10 hours but less 100 hours at a temperature between 10 - 40Â°C and preferably between 25 - 40Â°C and a pH of 3.5 to 6.0. The use of yeast in fermentation is well known and reference is made to THE ALCOHOL TEXTBOOK, K. JACQUES ET AL., EDS. 1999, NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY PRESS, UK.<br>
In some embodiments at least 5 vol%, at least 8 vol %, at least 10 vol%, at least 12 vol%, at least 15 vol% and at least 18 vol% of ethanol will be produced in the fermentation media. In other embodiments, the amount of ethanol produced in the fermentation media will be between 5 - 30%, also between 5 - 25%, and between 5 -20%.<br>
Following the fermentation, alcohol (i.e., ethanol) may be recovered from the fermentation media by means known in the art. In some embodiments, the alcohol in the fermented medium may be distilled, for example by heating or vacuum distillation. The ethanol may then be used, for example, as fuel ethanol or potable ethanol. The remaining residue, known as stillage may also be recovered and components of the stillage recycled for the next fermentation or the stillage may be separated into a soluble fraction or insoluble fraction.<br>
When the stillage is separated for example by centrifugation or screening into a soluble fraction and an insoluble fraction, these fractions can be used to make distillers' solubles or distillers' dried solubles or mixed together to make distillers' dried grain plus solubles (DDGS). One skilled in the art is familiar with processes for forming DDGS and distillers' grains in general. In some embodiments of the invention, when % ethanol increases in the fermentation process, the amount of DDGS decreases. However, one significant advantage of the method encompassed by the invention may be an increase in the % total protein in the DDGS and reference is made to example 10. The DDGS may then be used for example, in an animal feed formulation.<br>
In some embodiments, the SSF process encompassed by the invention will result in a DDGS containing less than 30%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 9%, less than 8%, less than 7%, less than 6%, less than 5%, less than 4%, less than 2% and less than 1 % residual starch. It is contemplated that the DDGS which results from the process according to the invention while having lower residual starch content compared to DDGS prepared by prior art processes will actually have an increased total amount of protein and therefore be of additional benefit for used in animal feeds.<br>
The residual starch which is recovered from the fermentation may be recycled along with enzymes and/or microorganisms and subjected to renewed fermentation. In<br><br>
one embodiment, means for fermenting a granular starch slurry of 20 - 50% ds contemporaneously with an asaA and glucoamylase and microorganism will result in residual starch when fermentation has proceeded to the intended alcohol content (e.gr., 8 to 30 %). The residual starch, the microorganisms and/or the residual enzymes may be mixed with fresh granular starch and additional aliquots of enzyme as needed to produce a fermentation charge for another fermentation. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to recycling the enzymes and/or microorganisms with the residual starch. In some embodiments, the microorganisms are removed from the residual starch prior to recycling of the residual starch and in other embodiments, only the microorganisms are recycled. An example of the various embodiments presented herein is observed in Figure 12.<br>
While in preferred embodiments, the desired end-product is ethanol, the desired end-product may be any product that may be produced by the enzymatic conversion of the granular starch substrate. Glucose obtained from the hydrolysis of granular starch may be bioconverted into numerous products such as but not limited to ascorbic acid intermediates (e.g., gluconate, 2-keto-L-gulonic acid, idonate, 5-keto-gluconate and 2,5-diketogluconate); 1, 3-propanediol; aromatic amino acids (e.g. tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan); organic acids (e.g. lactate, succinate, isocitrate and oxaloacetate); amino acids (serine and glycine); pyruvate and others. One skilled in the art is aware of various fermentation conditions which may be used in the production of these end-products and enzyme assays to measure the levels of protein expression.<br>

The following assays and methods are used in the examples provided below:<br>
Glucoamvlase assay; Glucoamylase activity was measured using a well-known assay which is based on the ability of glucoamylase to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyk alpha-D-glucopyranoside (PNPG) to glucose and p-nitrophenol. At an alkaline pH, the nitrophenol; forms a yellow color that is proportional to glucoamylase activity and is monitored at 400nm and compared against an enzyme standard measured as a GAU,<br>
One "Glucoamylase Activity Unit" (GAU) is defined as the amount of enzyme that will produce 1 gm of reducing sugar, calculated as glucose per hour from a soluble starch substrate (4%ds) at pH 4.2 and 60Â°C.<br>
The measurement of acid-stable alpha amylase activity is based on the degree of hydrolysis of soluble potato starch substrate (4% ds) by an aliquot of the enzyme sample at pH 4.5, 50Â°C. The reducing sugar content is measured using the DNS method as described in Miller, G. L. (1959) Anal. Chem. 31:426 - 428. One unit of the enzyme activity (SSU, soluble starch unit) is equivalent to the reducing power of 1mg of glucoise released per minute at the specific incubation conditions.<br>
Determination_of total starch content: The enzyme-enzyme starch liquefaction and saccharification process was used to determine the total starch content. In a typical analysis, 2 g of the dry sample was taken in a 100 ml Kohlraucsh flask and 45 ml of<br><br>
MOPS buffer, pH 7.0 was added. The slurry was well stirred for 30 min. SPEZYME FRED (1:50 diluted in water), 1.0 ml was added and heated to boiling for 3 - 5 min. The flask was placed in an autoclave maintained at 121 Â°C for 15 min. After autoclaving the flask was placed in a water bath at 95Â°C and 1 ml of 1:50 dilutes SPEZYME FRED was added and incubated for 45 min. The pH was adjusted to pH 4.2 and the temperature was reduced to 60Â°C. This was followed by addition of 20 ml acetate buffer, pH 4.2. Saccharification was carried out by adding 1.0 ml of 1:100 diluted OPTIDEX L-400 (Glucoamylase from Genencor International Inc.) and the incubation was continued for 18 hr at 60Â°C. The enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 95Â°C for 10 min. The total sugar composition was determined by HPLC analysis using glucose as a standard. The soluble starch hydrolysate from water extraction of a sample at room temperature without enzymatic treatment was subtracted from the total sugar.<br>
Residual starch iodine test: A,sample of the beer (fermentation broth) was centrifuged in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was decanted and the tube containing the pellet was placed in an ice bath. Several drops of 0.025N iodine solution (0.1 N iodine from VWR Cat. No. VW3207-1 diluted 4X) was added to the pellet and mixed. A positive (+) starch shows a range of color from blue to purple and the intensity of color is directly proportional to the concentration of starch. A negative result (-) remains yellowish.<br>

Preparation of asaA used in examples 7-12 was as follows. At the end of the fermentation of the T. reesei which expresses asaA (prepared according to examples 2 and 3), the biomass was separated by centrifugation and the clear culture filtrate was concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off ultrafiltration membrane. This ultrafiltrated concentrate having (90 SSU/g)was used.<br>
Preparation of qlucoamylase used in examples 7 -12 was as follows: A selected fungal strain of Aspergillus niger as described in USP 3,249,514 was used. After fermentation, fungal mycelia were separated using conventional separation methods including filtration and centrifugation. The clear filtrate was concentrated by ultrafiltration at 5Â°C to a specified activity.<br><br>
EXAMPLE! Cloning the Aspergillus kawachi acid-stable alpha-amylase gene.<br>
Genomic DMA was extracted from an overnight culture of A. kawachi mycelia. The FastDNA Kit (QbioGene, Carlsbad, CA) SPINâ¢ protocol was used according to the manufacturer's instructions for fungi. For homogenization, the sample was processed for 30 sec at speed 4.0 on a FastPrep Instrument.   PCR primers were designed, based on the asa&gt;4 sequence of A. Kaneko, et al. (Kaneko et al., (1996), J. Perm Bioeng 81:292-298). The forward primer contained a motif for directional cloning into the pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen).<br>
The sequence of the alphaG primer was CACCATGAGAGTGTCGACTTCAAG (SEQ ID NO. 6) and the sequence of the AkaaS primer was CTACCTCCACGTATCAACCAC (SEQ ID NO. 7).<br>
The 2.36 kb PCR product was purified by gel extraction (Gel Purification kit, Qiagen) and cloned into pENTR/D, according to the Invitrogen Gateway system protocol. The vector was then transformed into chemically competent TopIO E.coli (Invitrogen) with kanamycin selection. Plasmid DNA from several clones was digested with restriction enzymes to confirm the correct size insert. The alpha-amylase gene insert was sequenced (Sequetech, Mountain View, CA) from several clones (SEQ ID NO:1). Plasmid DNA from one clone, pENTR/D_Akaa#11, was added to the LR clonase reaction (Invitrogen Gateway system) with pTrex3g/a/7idS destination vector DNA. Recombination, in the LR clonase reaction, replaced the CmR and ccdB genes of the destination vector with the A. kawachi asaA from the pENTR/D vector. This recombination directionally inserted asa&gt;4 between the cbhl promoter and terminator of the destination vector. Recombination site sequences of 48 and 50 bp remained upstream and downstream, respectively, of the alpha amylase. An aliquot of the LR clonase reaction was transformed into chemically competent TopIO E.coli and grown overnight with carbenicillin selection. Plasmid DNA from several clones was restriction digested to confirm the correct insert size. Plasmid DNA from clone, pTrex3g__Akalpha#1 (Figure 4) was digested with EcoRI to release the expression cassette including the cbhl promoterasaAobA)/ terminator:amdS. This 7.8 kb cassette was purified by agarose extraction using standard techniques and transformed into a strain of T. reesei derived from the publicly available strain QM6a, as further described below.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 Biolistic transformation of T. reesei.<br>
A Trichoderma reesei spore suspension was spread onto the center -6 cm diameter of an MABA transformation plate (150 uJ of a 5 x 107 - 5 x 108 spore/ml suspension). The plate was then air dried in a biological hood. The stopping screens (BioRad 165-2336) and macrocarrier holders (BioRad 1652322) were soaked in 70% ethanol and air dried.  DriRite desiccant was placed in small Petri dishes (6 cm Pyrex) and overlaid with Whatman filter paper. The macrocarrier holder containing the macrocarrier (BioRad 165-2335) was placed flatly on top of filter paper and the Petri dish lid replaced.<br>
A tungsten particle suspension was prepared by adding 60 mg tungsten M-10 particles (microcarrier, 0.7 micron, BioRad #1652266) to an Eppendorf tube. 1 ml ethanol (100%) was added. The tungsten was votexed in the ethanol solution and allowed to soak for 15 minutes. The Eppendorf tube was microfuged briefly at maximum speed to pellet the tungsten. The ethanol was decanted and washed three times with sterile distilled water. After the water wash was decanted the third time, the tungsten was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile 50% glycerol. The tungsten was' prepared fresh at least every two weeks.<br>
The transformation reaction was prepared by adding 25 uJ of suspended tungsten to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for each transformation. Subsequent additions were made in order, 0.5-5 ^l DMA (Xbal-digested expression cassette), 25 u.l 2.5M CaCIa, 10 ul 0.1 M spermidine. The reaction was vortexed continuously for 5-10 minutes, keeping the tungsten suspended. The Eppendorf tube was then microfuged briefly arid decanted. The tungsten pellet was washed with 200 uJ of 70% ethanol, microfuged briefly to pellet and decanted. The pellet was washed with 200 uJ of 100% ethanol, microfuged briefly to pellet, and decanted. The tungsten pellet was resuspended in 24 uJ 100% ethanol. The Eppendorf tube was placed in an ultrasonic water bath for 15 seconds and 8 u.l aliquots were transferred onto the center of the desiccated macrocarriers. The macrocarriers were left to dry in the desiccated Petri dishes.<br>
A He tank was turned on to 1500 psi. 1100 psi rupture discs (BioRad 165-2329) were used in the Model PDS-1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System (BioRad). When the tungsten solution was dry, a stopping screen and the macrocarrier holder were inserted into the PDS-1000. An MABA plate, containing the target T. reesei spores, was placed 6 cm below the stopping screen. A vacuum of 29 inches Hg was pulled on the<br><br>
chamber and held. The He Biolistic Particle Delivery System was fired. The chamber was vented and the MABA plate removed for incubation at 28Â°C until colonies appeared (5 days).<br>

The mycelia were recovered by transferring the shake flask contents into 50ml conical tubes and spinning at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the mycelial pellet was transferred into a 250 ml, 0.22 m CA or PES Corning filter bottle containing 40 ml of filtered (3-D-glucanase solution. The solution was incubated at 30Â°C, 200 rpm, for 2 hours to generate protoplasts. Protoplasts were harvested by filtration, through sterile Miracloth (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA), into a 50ml conical tube. The protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded. Protoplast pellets were washed once<br><br>
with 50ml of 1.2 M sorbitol; centrifuged (2000 rpm, 5 min.) and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed with 25ml of sorbitol/CaCI2. A haemocytometer was used to count the protoplasts and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and protoplast pellets resuspended.in a volume of sorbitol/CaCI2 sufficient to generate a protoplast solution with a protoplast concentration of 1.25x108/ml,<br>
For each transformation, an aliquot of 20 ug of expression vector DMA (in a volume no greater than 20 pi) was transferred into 15ml conical tubes, on ice. Protoplast suspension (200pl) and 50ul PEG solution was added to each tube. This was mixed gently and incubated on ice for 20 min. PEG (2 ml) solution was added to each transformation tube and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. 4 ml sorbitol/CaCI2 solution was added to each tube (total volume 6.2 ml) and mixed gently. Then 2 ml of the transformation mixture was added to each of 3 molten (50Â°C) top agar tubes. Each top agar mixture was poured onto a separate transformation plate and incubated at 30Â°C for four to seven days.<br>
For transformation with amdS selection, acetamide/sorbitol plates and top agar were used. Selection plates were the same as transformation plates, but without sorbitol.

standard liters per minute airflow. One hour after the initial glucose was exhausted, a 25% (w/w) lactose feed was started and fed in a carbon limiting fashion to prevent lactose accumulation. The concentrations of glucose and lactose were monitored using a glucose oxidase assay kit or a glucose hexokinase assay kit with beta-galactosidase added to cleave lactose, respectively (Instrumentation Laboratory Co., Lexington, MA). Samples were obtained at regular intervals to monitor the progress of the fermentation, Collected samples were spun in a 50ml centrifuge tube at 3/4 speed in an International; Equipment Company (Needham Heights, MA) clinical centrifuge. Sample supernatants were run of 4 -12% BIS-TRIS SDS -PAGE gels, under reducing conditions with MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) SDS running buffer and LDS sample buffer (Figure 5).<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Comparison of pH stability of native and recombinant A. kawachi acid-stable alpha<br>
amylase having GSH activity (asaA).<br>
Samples of recombinantly produced asaA (Tr-asaA) as described above and samples of native asaA were diluted to equal protein concentrations with 20 mM acetate buffer at pH 4.5. Reactions were run in 100 mM citrate/NaOH buffers at 50Â°C for 30 minutes at pH levels 3 to 7. 1.0 mL of the reaction was added to 5 mL of 10% corn starch (Cargill Foods, MN) in 100 mM acetate, pH 4.5 in sample tubes. The tubes were shaken at 50Â°C for 20 minutes. Then 0.5 mL 2.0% NaOH was added. Tubes were spun and 0.5 mL of the supernatant were assayed for reducing sugars using the Dinito Salicylic Acid (DNS) Assay (Goto et al., (1994) supra). The results are depicted in Figure 6. The r-asaA exhibited 100% residual activity at pH 3.9. In comparison the n-asaA exhibited 100% residual activity at pH 4.5.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Effect of Tr-asaA concentrations during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of non-cooked whole ground corn substrate.<br>
Tr-asaA was evaluated at two levels of glucoamylase (GA) from a cell free culture filtrate (0.5 and 1.0 GAU/g). Thirty six percent corn flour slurry was prepared containing dry corn steep (2.5 % of corn flour). The pH of the slurry was adjusted to 4.8 with dilute sulfuric acid. The total dry solids of the slurry were 33.85 %. Fermentations<br><br>
were carried out in 125 ml flasks containing 100 gm-of mash (slurry). The desired level$ of enzymes were added then 3 ml of propagated yeast slurry was added to start the fermentation. The yeast inoculum was prepared by adding 0.26 gm of dry Fali yeast to 100 gm of mash containing GA activity at 0.9 GAU/g of raw material solids. This slurry was placed in a 32CC water bath and gently mixed for about 17 hours. At various time intervals samples of the fermentation (beer) were taken for HPLC analysis. After 72 hours the fermentations was terminated and the beer was dried at 60Â°C to obtain the DDGS.<br>
The starch content of the DDGS was determined and the insoluble solids of the beer after terminating the fermentation were spot checked for starch by the addition of Iodine. The enzyme-: used in this study were A. niger GA. Table 1 summarizes ethanol levels, iodine stain t; the mash solids and % starch of the DDGS.<br><br>

Ethanol fermentation was carried out using whole ground corn as described in Example 7. Alpha amylases from the sources listed in Table 2 were added at 1.0 SSU/grarn of ground corn and glucoamylase at 0.5GAU/g. The samples were taken during the course of the fermentation and analyzed for ethanol content (Figure 7). After the fermentation, the insoluble solids (DDGS) were separated and the residual starch content of the corn mash at pH 5.0 was determined. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>

The results in Table 3 clearly show that Tr-asaA is very effective in aiding glucoamylase to hydroiyze granular starch under the ethanol fermentation conditions using yeast. Additionally, as observed from the table, % ethanol produced in the fermentation (18.44) is greater and % residual starch in DDGS (9.0) is significantly lower using the enzyme combination of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Evaluation of whole ground wheat in the ethanol fermentation using Tr- asaA.<br>
To a 36% slurry of whole ground wheat, dry corn steep liquor was added at 2.5% based on the weight of the whole ground wheat. The fermentations were carried out in 125 ml flasks containing 100 gm of mash. The pH of the slurry was adjusted to 4.8 with dilute sulfuric acid. The mash was diluted to a final concentration of 33.85% ds.<br>
Glucoamylase (0.5 GAU/g ground wheat) and asaA (1,0 SSU/g whole ground' wheat) were added to the mash. This was followed by adding 3.0 rnl of propagated yeast to start the fermentation. Yeast inoculum was prepared by adding 0.26 gm of dry Pali yeast to 100 gm of rrash. The fermentations were run in a 32Â°C water bath while gently stirred. At various time intervals samples of the fermentation broth (beer) were taken, centrifuged for HPLC analysis of sugar composition and ethanol (Table 4)<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
Effect of substrate treatment on the ethanol yield and composition of Distilleries Dry Grain Solids, (DDGS).<br>
Whole ground corn substrate was subjected to a conventional dry milling process for fuel alcohol fermentation using a hammer mill to reduce particle size. Three different mashes were prepared.<br>
Treatment 1 (Trt 1) is a high temperature treatment, which involved a batch liquefaction of a 36% ds corn flour slurry containing 0.9% dry corn steep (DCS) with 3.5U/g SPEZYME ETHYL at pH 5.6 by jet cooking according to the prior art procedures.<br><br>
The slurry was place in a 90Â°C bath for 1.5 hours, mixed and then cooled to 30Â°C with a pH adjustment to 5.0 with dilute sulfuric acid. The slurry was further diluted with water to<br>
32.71 %ds.<br>
Treatment 2 (Trt 2) is a low temperature treatment. The mash was prepared by incubating a 36% corn flour slurry containing 0.9% DCS with the pH adjusted to 5.0 with dilute sulfuric acid at 60Â°C for three hours. Prior to incubation 0.05 GAU/g of<br>
glucoamylase was added.<br>
Treatment 3 (Trt 3) is a room temperature treatment - a corn slurry was obtained at room temperature prior to use in the fermentation with 0.5 GAU glucoamylase/g of corn and 1.0 SSU/g corn of Tr-asaA.<br>
Yeast fermentation was then carried out on each treatment as described in example 7.<br>
After the fermentation, ethanol yield was determined and the insoluble solids from each treatment were separated by centrifugation, dried at 60Â°C and the,total carbohydrate content and nitrogen content were determined. The results are illustrated in Table 5, wherein Trt 3 is a process encompassed by the invention.<br>

As observed from the results illustrated in Table 5, the % residual starch in DDGS treated according to the process of the present invention (Trt 3) was less than the % residual starch obtained from the prior art treatment (Trt 1) or the low temperature treatment (Trt 2). The values were 3.5% (Trt 3) as opposed to 4.8% or 3.8% for Trt1 and Trt 2. The total protein content of the DDGS and the amount of ethanol produced was<br><br>
higher from Trt 3 according to the invention as compared to the prior art treatment (Trt<br>
1).<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Incubation of granular corn starch with purified Aspergillus kawachi alpha amylase and<br>
purified Aspergillus n/gerglucoamylase.<br>
Enzyme Purification:<br>
Aspergillus niger glucoamylase (GA) and Aspergillus kawachi alpha amylase (AkAA) were both purified from culture filtrate using a preparative high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using an AKTA (Arnersham Pharmacia, Biotech., NJ). In a typical experiment, both crude enzyme samples were desalted with 10 mM MES buffer (pH 5.75) to bring down the conductivity using a spin column (Bio-Rad, CA). The samples were brought up to 2M NH4SO2. The sample was loaded on to a Q-Sepharose column (Arnersham, Biosciences, NJ) and eluted with 20 mM MES buffer (pH 5.75) using a gradient of 1.5 M KCI. The fractions with corresponding activity were pooled together and concentrated for further experiments.<br>
Incubation with ..granular corn starch with purified enzymes:<br>
The purified enzyme preparations were added to a 4.0% granular corn starch (Cargill, Minneapolis, MN) in 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 4.5) as follows for Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis.<br>
Purified GA at 0.5 GAU/g corn starch; purified AkAA at 1.0 SSU/g starch; and GA and AkAA combined were incubated at 32Â°C with gentle stirring. Aliquot samples (0.75 ml) were taken at intervals of 2, 4 and 8 hours, centrifuged and the soluble sugar determined by the method described in the examples above. The pellet was resuspended in distilled water (5 ml) and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended again in 5 ml of absolute ethanol (99%), stirred for uniform mixing and centrifuged. The alcohol treated pellet was air-dried in the tube and used for SEM analysis.<br>
SEM analysis:<br>
Approximately 200 ul dry volume was transferred to a 1.5 ml Ependorf tube and 0.8 ml absolute ethanol was added. The components were vortexed to make a suspension of starch particles. A few drops of suspension was placed on a freshly cleaned glass cover slip and allowed to air dry. The cover slip was mounted on<br><br>
specimen stubs with carbon adhesive tabs, painted around the circumference Wvttifr-colloidal silver adhesive (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) and coated with a thin layer of gold in a ScanCoat Six Sputter Coater (Edwards High Vacuum Intl. Crawley, UK). Scanning electron microscopy was done at 5kv in the secondary electron imaging mode using a Quanta 200 PEG scanning electron microscope (FEl Inc., Hillsboro, Ore) at instrumental magnification of 1,000 and 5,000 X. Eight to ten images were made from different areas on each sample stub. The effect of individual and combined enzyme treatments on the granular corn starch is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.<br>
Hydrolysis and microscopic examination:<br>
Reducing sugar (mg/ml reducing equivalents), measured as glucose released after 4 hours as a result of granular starch hydrolysis by AkAA and GA is illustrated in Figure 8. Degradation of granular starch with glucoamylase alone was 4.9 mg/ml; degradation of granular starch with AkAA alone was only 0.3 mg/ml. However, degradation of granular starch with the combination of GA and AkAA was 12.1 mg/ml. The degradation value for the enzymes combined illustrates a synergistic interaction, which is significantly greater than the additive value of the enzymes.<br>
The starch granules treated as described in this example were observed with a scanning electron microscope. As shown in Figure 9, corn starch granules incubated with purified AkAA did show minor surface modification. These were observed as small pin prick holes. Corn starch granules incubated with purified GA showed many small defined deep holes. Significantly, corn starch granules incubated with the combination of GA and AkAA showed numerous wide and deep penetrating cavities. Additionally, surface erosion, which exposed the layered structure of the granular center, was observed in the granules incubated with the combination of GA and AkAA.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Effect of % Dry Solids Content (ds) of a Granular Corn Starch Slurry<br>
on Ethanol Yield<br>
Corn flour was slurried with water to obtain a 36% ds mash. A small amount of corn steep (0.2% of the slurry) was added along with 400 ppm (0.04%) urea to the mash prior to adjusting the pH to 4.5 with sulfuric acid. The dry solids content of the slurry was adjusted from 20 to 36% ds; The fermentations were carried out in 125 ml flasks containing a total of 100 g mash. The enzymes were diluted so that a constant volume of<br><br>
0.5 ml was used for each enzyme. Each flask was inoculated with 3 ml of yeast that was propagated 17 hours prior to use. The yeast propagation procedure involved adding 0.5% dry Fali yeast to 25% ds mash containing 0.5 GAU/g of GA and 1.5 SSU/g AkAA and incubating while gently mixing in a 32Â°C water bath. At approximately 24 hour time intervals samples of beer were dried at 60Â°C to obtain DDGS.<br>
Table 6<br>
Effect of DS Content on the Ethanol Production and Residual Starch in DDGS at 75 hours<br><br>
%DS 	GA (0.5 GAU/g) 	AkAA (1.5 SSU/g) + GA (0.5 GAU/g) <br>
	% v/v EtOH 	DDGS % residual starch 	% v/v EtOH 	DDGS % residual starch <br>
20 	9.86 	2.28 	10.15 	1.37 <br>
24 	11.75 	5.79 	12.51 	1.00 <br>
28 	13.51 	13.07 	14.80 	1.83 <br>
32 	15.38 	18.06 	17.47 	3.78 <br>
36 	16.39 	29.37 	18.07 	13.36 <br>
Almost all of the glucose (DP-1) generated during the fermentation was converted to ethanol except at the high solids (data not shown). For each % DS tested, the AkAA increased the rate and amount of ethanol. Figure 10A summarizes the final ethanol level at each solids level and Figure 10B shows the % increase in ethanol with AkAA for each solid against mash solids. Both figures demonstrate the positive effect AkAA has on hydrolyzing granular starch and particularly at high solids %. Also as observed in Figure 10A, as the dissolved solids increase, the difference in the residual starch with and without AkAA also increases. As observed in Figure 10B as the % ds in the corn slurry increases, the influence of AkAA on ethanol production increases.<br>
The results from Table 6 and Fig 11 clearly show a benefit of using a composition of AkAA and GA in the methods of the invention. In all instances the % starch in the DDGS is decreased when the AkAA is used in combination with the GA and further the % starch found in DDGS from a corn starch substrate having a % ds as high as 36% is reduced by half when compared to the % starch in a DDGS without the addition of AkAA.<br><br>
