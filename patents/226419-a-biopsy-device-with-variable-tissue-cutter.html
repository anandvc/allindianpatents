FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to biopsy devices and, more particularly,<br>
to methods and devices for advancing and driving a cutter in a biopsy device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancerous tumors is an ongoing<br>
area of investigation. Medical devices for obtaining tissue samples for<br>
subsequent sampling are known in the art. For instance, a biopsy instrument now<br>
marketed under the trade name MAMMOTOME is commercially available for<br>
use in obtaining breast biopsy samples.<br>
The following patent documents disclose various biopsy devices and are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: US 6,273,862 issued Aug 14,<br>
2001; US 6,231,522 issued May 15, 2001; US 6,228,055 issued May 8, 2001; US<br>

2003/0199754 published Oct 23,2003.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It can be desirable to vary the translational speed of a rotating and translating<br>
cutter in a biopsy device. For instance, it may be desirable to have the cutter<br>
translate at different rates. By way of example, US Patent 6,120,462 discloses a<br>
method for controlling a biopsy device.<br>
While motor speed can be varied corresponding to a desired variation in<br>
translational speed of a cutter, it may be undesirable to require operation of a<br>
motor at significantly different speeds, or to incorporate complex controls for<br>
varying a motor speed. A transmission assembly having a gear train could be<br>
employed to vary a cutter translation speed, but such an approach may add<br>
undesired complexity or weight to the biopsy device.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a biopsy device comprising<br>
a cannula haying a tissue receiving port; a tissue cutter disposed coaxially with<br>
the cannula, the cutter adapted for translation relative to the cannula; and a<br>
variable pitch member operatively associated with the tissue cutter for providing<br>
variation in the translational speed of the tissue cutter. The tissue cutter can be<br>
adapted for translation and rotation within the cannula during a portion of the<br>
cutter travel. A motor, such an electric motor, can be employed for rotating the<br>
variable pitch member. The motor can provide rotation at a desired speed, and the<br><br>
variable pitch member can be employed to vary the translational speed of the<br>
cutter independently of the rotational speed of the motor.<br>
The variable pitch member can be in the form of a variable pitch rotation shaft<br>
having a threaded portion of varying pitch for providing a variable pitch cam<br>
surface. The biopsy device can be a handheld device which includes a first<br>
motor for providing rotation of the variable pitch member and a second motor for<br>
providing rotation of the cutter. The variable pitch rotation shaft can include a<br>
relatively coarse pitch portion for advancing the cutter at a relatively rapid rate<br>
prior to tissue cutting, and a relatively fine pitch portion for advancing the cutter<br>
at a relatively slower rate during tissue cutting.<br>
The variable pitch cam surface of the variable pitch rotation shaft can be in the<br>
form of a cam slot formed in the outer surface of the shaft. A cam nut can be<br>
supported on the rotated shaft, and can be translated along the length of the shaft<br>
at a speed that is a function of the pitch of the cam slot on the shaft. Depending<br>
on the direction of rotation of the shaft, translation of the cam nut can provide<br>
translation of the cutter in a forward (distal) or reverse (proximal) direction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to a biopsy device for obtaining a tissue portion<br>
from within a body and, in particular, to controlling the speed of a cutting<br>
instrument within a core biopsy device. An example of a core biopsy device is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,086,544 issued to Hibner et al., which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 1 shows a core sampling biopsy<br>
instrument according to the present invention comprising a handpiece identified<br><br>
generally by the numeral 20, a vacuum system 22, a control unit 24, and a power<br>
source 26. Handpiece 20 is preferably lightweight and ergonomically-shaped to<br>
be easily manipulated by an operator's hand. Handpiece 20 includes a probe<br>
assembly 28 and a detachably connected holster 30.<br>
Probe assembly 28 is connected to vacuum system 22 by a first vacuum tube 32<br>
and a second vacuum tube 34. First and second vacuum tubes 32,34 are<br>
detachably connected to vacuum system 22 by a first connector 36 and a second<br>
connector 38 respectively. First connector 36 has a male portion 40 and a female<br>
portion 42 attached to first vacuum tube 32. Second connector 38 has a female<br>
portion 44 and a male portion 46 attached to second vacuum tube 34. Connector<br>
portions 40,42,44 and 46 are attached in this manner to prevent the accidental<br>
switching of first and second tubes 32 and 34 to vacuum system 22. Holster 30<br>
includes a control cord 48 operationally connecting the handpiece 20 to control<br>
unit 24 and power source 26. Control cord 48 provides electrical power and<br>
control information to handpiece 20.<br>
Because handpiece 20 is manipulated by the operator's hand rather than by an<br>
electromechanical arm, the operator may steer the tip of handpiece 20 with great<br>
freedom towards the tissue mass of interest. The surgeon has tactile feedback<br>
while doing so and can thus ascertain, to a significant degree, the density and<br>
hardness of the tissue being encountered. In addition, handpiece 20 may be held<br>
approximately parallel to the chest wall of the patient for obtaining tissue<br>
portions closer to the chest wall than may be obtained when using an instrument<br>
mounted to an electromechanical arm. Those skilled in the art may appreciate<br>
that a mount or "nest" could be provided to hold handpiece 20 securely to the<br>
movable arm of an X-ray stereotactic table in the event that it is desirable to use<br>
an X-ray stereotactic table.<br><br>
FIG. 2 shows probe assembly 28 disconnected from holster 30. Probe assembly<br>
28 includes an upper shell 50 and a lower shell 52 each of which may be<br>
injection molded from a rigid, biocompatible plastic, such as a polycarbonate.<br>
Upon final assembly of probe assembly 28, upper and lower shells 50,52 can be<br>
joined together along a joining edge 54 by any of a number of methods well<br>
known for joining plastic parts, including, without limitation, ultrasonic welding,<br>
snap fasteners, interference fit, and adhesive joining. Similarly, holster 30<br>
includes an upper shell 56 and a lower shell 58 which also may be injection<br>
molded from a rigid, biocompatible plastic, such as a polycarbonate, and joined<br>
together along edge 60 by any suitable method for joining plastic parts.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show the bottom portions of holster 30 and probe lower shell 52.<br>
As shown in the figures, a probe latch 62 can be molded into lower probe shell<br>
52 for detachably connecting probe assembly 28 to holster 30. Probe latch 62 is<br>
a cantilevered beam and can be deflected downwardly by a force applied to a<br>
latch ramp surface 64. Probe latch 62 further comprises a latch projection 66 for<br>
insertion into a holster slot 67 as a proximal end of probe assembly 28 is inserted<br>
into holster 30. Ramp surface 64 is deflected downwardly by interaction<br>
between the surface 64 and an inside surface 65 of holster shell 30. Probe latch<br>
62 retainably snaps into a slot key 68 when probe assembly 28 is fully inserted<br>
into holster 30. To remove probe assembly 28 from holster 30, the operator<br>
manually depresses projection 66 until ramp surface 64 disengages from slot key<br>
68. Projection 66 may then be pulled axially through slot 67 until the probe<br>
assembly 28 and holster 30 are separated.<br>
Returning now to FIGS. 1 and 2, which show that electrical switches are<br>
mounted on holster upper shell 56 to enable the operator to use the handpiece 20<br><br>
with a single hand. These switches can include a two position rocker switch 72<br>
for actuating the motion of the cutter (e.g. forward movement of rocker switch 72<br>
moves the cutter in the forward (distal) direction for tissue sampling and<br>
rearward movement of the rocker switch 72 actuates the cutter in the reverse<br>
(proximal) direction to position a tissue sample in sample retrieval surface 74),<br>
and a vacuum switch 76 for actuating vacuum system 22. One-handed operation<br>
allows the operator's other hand to be free, for example, to hold an ultrasonic<br>
imaging device. A ridge 78 on the distal end of holster 30 is provided to assist<br>
the operator in grasping handpiece 20 and operating switches 72, 76. Probe<br>
assembly shells 50, 52 may also be contoured to improve the operator's grip on<br>
the instrument during use.<br>
First and second vacuum tubes 32,34 can be made from a flexible, transparent or<br>
translucent material, such as silicon tubing, PVC tubing or polyethylene tubing.<br>
This enables visualization of the material flowing through the tubes 32,34. As<br>
shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, one or more slots such as, for example, that indicated by<br>
numeral 70, can be provided in holster shell 58 to provide clearance for first and<br>
second vacuum tubes 32, 34. An open area at the distal end of probe assembly<br>
28 allows access to sample retrieval surface 74. The operator or an assistant can<br>
retrieve a tissue sample from surface 74.<br>
FIG. 5 provides an exploded isometric view of probe assembly 28. A biopsy<br>
needle, including a piercer 80 is located at a distal end of probe assembly 28 for<br>
insertion into the surgical patient's skin to obtain a tissue sample. Piercer 80<br>
comprises a cannula having an elongated, metallic piercer tube 82 and an<br>
associated lumen 84 extending along the axial length of the tube. Adjacent the<br>
distal end of piercer tube 82 is a lateral tissue receiving port 86 for receiving the<br>
tissue to be extracted from the surgical patient. Joined alongside piercer tube 82<br><br>
is an elongated vacuum tube 88 having a vacuum lumen 90. Piercer tube 82 can<br>
be formed of any suitable material, including metal or plastic, and can be jointed<br>
to piercer tube 84 or formed together with the piercer tube. As shown in FIG. 6,<br>
piercer lumen 84 is in fluid communication with vacuum lumen 90 via a plurality<br>
of vacuum holes 92 located in the bottom of the tissue aperature defined by port<br>
86. These vacuum holes 92 are small enough to remove fluids, but not large<br>
enough to allow excised tissue portions to be removed through first vacuum tube<br>
32, which is fluidly connected to vacuum lumen 90 of vacuum tube 88. A<br>
sharpened tip of piercer 80 can be formed by a separate piercing endpiece 94<br>
attached to the distal end of the piercer. Endpiece 94 can have a two-sided, flat-<br>
shaped point, or other shapes suitable for penetrating the tissue of a surgical<br>
patient.<br>
The proximal end of piercer 80 is attached to a union sleeve 96 having a<br>
longitudinal bore 98 therethrough, and a transverse opening 102 into a widened<br>
center portion of the bore. An elongated, metallic, tubular cutter 104 is axially<br>
aligned within longitudinal bore 98 of union sleeve 96 and piercer lumen 84 of<br>
piercer 80 so that the cutter may slide easily in both the distal and proximal<br>
directions. A cutter guide 106 is disposed in the proximal end of union sleeve<br>
96. Cutter guide 106 can be in the form of a metallic funnel-shaped guide that<br>
ensures proper alignment between cutter 104 and union sleeve 96. Union sleeve<br>
96 and cutter guide 106 are supported between probe upper and lower shells 50,<br>
52 by integrally-formed support ribs 107 extending from lower shell 52, and an<br>
integrally-formed housing 108 at the distal end of upper shell 50. These<br>
integrally-formed supports 107, 108, along with a slot 110 and opening 112<br>
formed in probe shells 50, 52, ensure proper alignment between the cutter 104<br>
and union sleeve 96 so that the cutter may be translated easily in both the distal<br>
and proximal directions. The distal end of first vacuum tube 32 is attached to a<br><br>
polymeric vacuum fitting 113 that inserts tightly into transverse opening 102 of<br>
union sleeve 96. Opening 102 is in fluid communication with lumen 90, and<br>
allows the communication of fluids in piercer lumen 84 to a vacuum reservoir in<br>
vacuum system 22 via vacuum holes 92.<br>
A cutter lumen 114 extends through substantially the entire length of cutter 104.<br>
An elongated, hollow, tubular tissue remover 115 can be disposed coaxially<br>
within cutter lumen 114, such that cutter 104 may translate along a length of the<br>
remover 115. Tissue remover 115 may be metallic or non metallic. Second<br>
vacuum line 34 can be fluidly attached to the proximal end of tissue remover 115<br>
to provide vacuum to the cutter lumen 114 via a central passageway extending<br>
through the tissue remover 115. Second vacuum tube 34 exits lower shell 52<br>
alongside the first vacuum tube out an opening 117. A strainer 119 is attached to<br>
the distal end of tissue remover 115 to prevent fragmented tissue pieces from<br>
passing through the remover and into vacuum system 22.<br>
The tissue remover 115 can be held stationary with respect to the lower shell 52<br>
and can be supported by a pair of proximal supports (not shown) on the inside of<br>
probe lower shell 52. Second vacuum line 34 provides vacuum through cutter<br>
lumen 114 via the hollow remover 115, which vacuum can be used to assist in<br>
drawing tissue into tissue receiving port 86 when the distal end of cutter 104 is<br>
positioned proximal of the port.<br>
The distal end of cutter 104 is sharpened to form a cutter blade 116 for cutting<br>
tissue held against the blade as cutter 104 is rotated. The proximal end of cutter<br>
104 is attached inside an axial bore of a cutter gear 118. Cutter gear 118 may be<br>
metallic or polymeric, and includes a plurality of cutter gear teeth 120. Each of<br><br>
the gear teeth 120 has a typical spur gear tooth configuration as is well known in<br>
the art.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, cutter gear 118 is driven by an elongated rotary<br>
drive shaft 122 having a plurality of drive gear teeth 124 designed to mesh with<br>
cutter gear teeth 120. In this embodiment, drive gear teeth 124 extend<br>
approximately the entire length of drive shaft 122 and engage cutter gear teeth<br>
120 throughout the translation of cutter 104. Drive gear teeth 124 are in<br>
continual engagement with cutter gear teeth 120 to rotate cutter 104 whenever<br>
drive shaft 122 is rotatably driven. As will be described in more detail below,<br>
drive shaft 122 rotates cutter 104 as the cutter advances distally through tissue<br>
receiving port 86 for the cutting of tissue. Drive shaft 122 may be injection<br>
molded from a rigid engineering plastic such as liquid crystal polymer material<br>
or, alternatively, could be manufactured from a metallic or non-metallic material.<br>
Drive shaft 122 could also be extruded from aluminum or machined from a<br>
metallic material.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, drive shaft 122 includes a first axial end 126 extending<br>
distally from the shaft. Axial end 126 is supported for rotation within probe<br>
lower shell 52 by a drive shaft interface 127 molded on the inside of the probe<br>
shell. Similarly, a second axial end 128 extends proximally from rotary drive<br>
shaft 122 and is supported in a second interface 130 also molded on the inside of<br>
probe lower shell 52. An O-ring 131 and bushing 133 may be provided on each<br>
axial end 126, 128 so as to sit within interfaces 127, 130 when rotary drive shaft<br>
122 is mounted in probe shell 52. Bushing 133 reduces friction at the drive shaft<br>
interfaces 127, 130, while O-ring 131 isolates vibrations in rotary drive shaft 122<br>
from the rest of probe assembly 28. Bushing 133 could also be used without O-<br>
ring 131 at interfaces 127, 130. A drive slot 132 is formed in axial end 128.<br><br>
Drive slot 132 interfaces with a corresponding drive slot formed in a motor drive<br>
shaft 134, or other rotational drive input for providing rotation of the drive shaft,<br>
as will be described further below.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, a cam nut 136 is provided in probe assembly 28<br>
to hold cutter gear 118 and carry the cutter gear and attached cutter 104 during<br>
translation in both the distal and proximal directions. Cam nut 136 is preferably<br>
molded from a rigid polymer and has a cylindrically shaped bore 138 extending<br>
axially therethrough. A pair of J-shaped hook extensions 140 extend from one<br>
side of cam nut 136. Hook extensions 140 rotatably support cutter 104 on either<br>
side of cutter gear 118 to provide proximal and distal translation of gear 118 and<br>
cutter 104 during proximal and distal translation of cam nut 136. Hook<br>
extensions 140 align cutter 104 and cutter gear 118 in the proper orientation for<br>
cutter gear teeth 120 to mesh with drive gear teeth 124.<br>
Cam nut 136 is supported on shaft 142 for translational movement along<br>
translation shaft 142. Shaft 142 extends through cam nut bore 138 in parallel<br>
with cutter 104 and rotary drive shaft 122. Translation shaft 142 may be made<br>
from aluminum or another similar material, and includes a path, such as a path in<br>
the form of lead screw thread groove 144 which can be machined or otherwise<br>
formed in the outer circumference of the shaft 142. The thread groove 144 can<br>
be generally helical. The pitch of lead screw thread groovel44 may vary<br>
between the proximal and distal ends of translation shaft 142. In the embodiment<br>
described herein, the lead screw pitch varies from a coarser or more widely<br>
spaced pitch at the proximal portion of the shaft, to a finer, more closely spaced<br>
pitch at the distal portion of the shaft. The particular pitch width of thread<br>
groove 144, as well as the ratio of wide to narrow pitch width along the length of<br><br>
the translation shaft, will vary in the present invention depending upon the<br>
desired operation of cutter 104.<br>
In the figures, translation shaft 142 is shown with a right hand thread so that<br>
clockwise rotation (looking from the proximal to the distal direction) causes cam<br>
nut 136 to translate along shaft 142 in the proximal direction, while the reverse<br>
rotation of shaft 142 causes cam nut 136 to move in the distal direction.<br>
However, the thread direction could also be reversed, with the particular<br>
direction of the screw thread depending upon the application and rotary drive<br>
input.<br>
As shown in greater detail in FIGS. 10A and 10B, cam nut 136 is molded,<br>
machined, or otherwise formed to include a receiver hole 150 extending<br>
perpendicular to bore 138. A cam follower pin 152 is positioned within receiver<br>
hole 150 such that a portion of the pin extends beyond cam nut 136 and into lead<br>
screw thread groove 144 of translation shaft 142 as the thread passes through<br>
bore 138. Lead screw thread groove 144 forms a path in which to guide cam<br>
follower pin 152 about the surface of translation shaft 142 as the shaft is rotated.<br>
Cam follower pin 152 can be a metallic, machined pin that is assembled as part<br>
of cam nut 136 to create the interface between the cam nut 136 and translation<br>
shaft 142. In the embodiment shown, cam follower pin 152 is assembled with an<br>
interference fit in cam nut receiver hole 150. Alternatively, pin 152 could be<br>
inserted by other methods, such as by insert molding or with screw threads. In<br>
yet another embodiment, pin 152 can be supported on cam nut 136 so as to be<br>
able to move radially and so "float" in thread groove 144.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10B, cam follower pin 152 sits within cam receiver hole 150<br>
and can have a tapered or otherwised shaped tip, as indicated by angled surface<br><br>
156, that is shaped to match the profile of cam path 144. Cam path 144 can have<br>
a tapered profile. The angled surface 156 allows cam follower pin 152 to freely<br>
slide within the tapered pathway formed by lead screw thread 144, and adapt<br>
easily to the changing pitch of the thread and/or width of die thread 144.<br>
Returning to FIGS. 8 and 9, a slot 158 is provided in the proximal end of<br>
translation shaft 142 for attaching the shaft to a drive motor shaft, such as shaft<br>
160 shown in FIG. 15. Motor shaft 160 provides rotation of translation shaft 142<br>
through mating shaft ends 158, 162. As translation shaft 142 rotates, cam nut<br>
136 follows the variable pitch cam path 144 due to the interface between the path<br>
and cam follower pin 152. Accordingly, cam nut 136 translates along the length<br>
of shaft 142 as shaft 142 rotates. As cam nut 136 is translated distally by rotation<br>
of translation shaft 142, cutter gear 118 is pushed forward (distally) by hook<br>
extensions 140. Cutter gear 118 is rigidly attached to cutter 104 to move the<br>
cutter in the same direction and at the same speed as the translation of cam nut<br>
136. As translation shaft 142 rotates within cam nut 136, cylindrically shaped<br>
bore 138 serves as a bushing to stabilize the cam nut as it traverses translation<br>
shaft 142.<br>
During operation of the biopsy instrument of the present invention, cutter 104<br>
translates in either direction between a fully retracted position just proximal to<br>
sample retrieval surface 74 and a fully deployed position just distal to tissue<br>
receiving port 86. In the embodiment shown, the cutter 104 can translate a<br>
distance of about six inches from the fully retracted position to the fully deployed<br>
position. There are intermediate positions along the length of the cutter<br>
translation which can be identified. When the distal end 116 of cutter 104 reaches<br>
each of these positions, adjustments to either the cutter rotational speed<br>
(sometimes referred to simply as rotation speed) or the cutter translational speed<br><br>
(sometimes referred to simply as translation speed), or both, may be made, if<br>
desired.<br>
For the embodiment of the biopsy device described herein, four positions along<br>
the length of the cutter translation may be identified. At each of these positions,<br>
adjustments may be made to the cutter rotational and/or translational speed.<br>
These speed variations may be accomplished in different manners within the<br>
biopsy instrument either mechanically or through motor speed variation. To<br>
facilitate description of the cutter positions, they are to be understood as actually<br>
the positions of cutter blade 116 on the distal end of cutter 104. These four cutter<br>
positions are the following: a first position where cutter 104 is just proximal to<br>
sample retrieval surface 74; a second position where cutter 104 is just distal to<br>
sample retrieval surface 74; a third position where cutter 104 is just proximal to<br>
tissue receiving port 86; and a fourth position where cutter 104 is just distal to<br>
port 86. These four positions are sometimes referred to as position one, position<br>
two, position three, and position four. These four cutter positions are given by<br>
way of example only, and numerous other cutter positions may be used in the<br>
present invention for signaling adjustments to cutter rotational speed an/or<br>
translational speed without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 5,6 and 9, as cutter 104 translates from<br>
position one to position two along the translational length, cam follower pin 152<br>
traverses the coarser pitched portion 146 of groove 144, thereby translating at a<br>
more rapid speed for each rotation of translation shaft 142. As cutter 104 moves<br>
from position two to position three, cam groove 144 transitions from a coarser<br>
pitch width to a finer pitch width, thereby slowing the translation speed of cutter<br>
104 for each rotation of shaft 142. As culler 104 approaches position three, drive<br>
shaft 122 begins rotating to correspondingly rotate the cutter. Accordingly,<br><br>
cutter 104 begins to rotate when cam follower pin 152 begins traversing the<br>
slower, fine pitch portion 148 of cam groove 144. The translation speed of cutter<br>
104 is slowed in the finer pitch portion 148 to advance the rotating cutter 104<br>
more slowly through tissue receiving port 86 during the cutting of tissue. During<br>
translation through tissue receiving port 86 (between positions three and four),<br>
cutter 104 is rotated by drive shaft 122 at the desired tissue cutting speed.<br>
The pitch width of cam groove 144 determines the linear distance traveled by<br>
cam nut 136 for each 360° rotation of translation shaft 142. The wider the pitch<br>
width of thread groove 144, the greater the linear distance traveled by cutter 104<br>
for each 360° rotation of shaft 142. Accordingly, the linear speed of cutter 104<br>
may be varied as a function of the location of cam nut 136 on translation shaft<br>
142. The pitch of thread groove 144 can be selected to provide a desired ratio of<br>
cutter translational speed to rotational speed of translation shaft 142. Thread<br>
groove 144 can function as a variable pitch cam path.<br>
FIGS. 9 and 11 illustrate the full extent of translation shaft 142 as well as the<br>
variable pitch thread groove 144. As shown in these figures, translation shaft<br>
142 may include areas adjacent the proximal and distal ends of the shaft where<br>
translation of cutter 104 is prevented regardless of the rotation of shaft 142. In<br>
these areas, indicated by numeral 164, lead screw thread groove 144 may have a<br>
pitch width of zero, and thereby form a 360° groove about the circumference of<br>
the shaft The 360° groove or no-pitch zone 164 inhibits travel of cam nut 136<br>
along translation shaft 142. As thread groove 144 transitions to no-pitch zone<br>
164, the diameter of translation shaft 142 can be decreased as indicated at 166,<br>
and the pitch of thread groove 144 made finer, to slow the translation of the pin<br>
152, and so the cutter 104.<br><br>
When cam nut 136 enters the no-pitch zone, shaft 142 may continue to rotate but<br>
the cam nut is prevented from translating along the shaft due to the retention of<br>
cam follower pin 152 within groove 164. When cutter 104 is at its distal most (or<br>
proximal most) point of travel, and the rotation direction of shaft 142 is reversed<br>
(such as by depressing rocker switch 72), cam follower pin 152 can be urged<br>
from no-pitch zone 164 back into engagement with variable pitch thread groove<br>
144. As shown in FIG. 11, a biasing device such as coil springs 168,170 may be<br>
provided adjacent each end of translation shaft 142 for urging cam nut 136 back<br>
into engagement with variable pitch thread groove 144 when the translation<br>
direction changes upon reversing the direction of rotation of shaft 142. Reducing<br>
the outer diameter of the shaft 142 at 166 adjacent the no-pitch zone 164 and<br>
making the pitch of the thread groove 144 finer can also be beneficial in reducing<br>
noise or vibration of the pin 152 as it rides in groove of the no-pitch zone 164.<br>
FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate no-pitch zone 164 and spring 168 as cam nut 136<br>
translates towards the proximal end of shaft 142. FIGS. 13A and 13B illustrate<br>
cam nut 136 after it has translated to its most proximal position (i.e. cutter<br>
position one). In this position, cam follower pin 152 engages no-pitch groove<br>
164 and spring 168 is compressed against cam nut 136. Cam nut 136 remains in<br>
this position as shaft 142 rotates due to cam follower pin 152 engaging no pitch<br>
zone 164. Once the rotation direction of shaft 142 is reversed, such as by<br>
changing motor direction, energy stored in spring 168 acts against cam nut 136 to<br>
push the cam nut 136 (via cam follower pin 152) out of no-pitch zone 164.<br>
Spring 168 pushes cam nut 136 back into engagement with variable pitch path<br>
corresponding to thread groove 144 so that the cam nut (and cutter 104) can<br>
begin translating in the opposite direction.<br><br>
The outer diameter of the shaft 142 can be machined or otherwise reduced and<br>
the threads (e.g. with tapered walls) of thread groove more closely spaced to<br>
provide a finer pitch (more threads per inch). In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
thread depth of cam path 144 having tapered thread walls may be varied in order<br>
to vary the translation speed of cam follower pin 152. For instance, the depth of<br>
cam path 144 may be reduced, while the diameter of shaft 142 remains constant,<br>
to enable the screw threads to be placed more closely together on the shaft. The<br>
closer spaced threads reduce the linear distance traveled by cutter 104 during<br>
each revolution of translation shaft 142.<br>
FIGS. 14A-14C depict three of the four positions of cutter 104 during the<br>
operation of the present invention as embodied in the prior FIGS. 1-13. The<br>
three positions of cutter 104 are most easily distinguished by observing the<br>
relative positions of cam nut 136 (which moves together with cutter 104) and<br>
cutting edge 116 on the distal end of cutter 104. FIG. 14A shows a partially cut<br>
away top view of probe assembly 28 in which cutter 104 is located in position<br>
one. In this position, cutter 104 is in a fully retracted position, with catting edge<br>
116 positioned proximal of sample retrieval surface 74. Cam nut 136 is<br>
positioned at the proximal end of translation shaft 142 with cam follower pin 152<br>
rotating within the no-pitch zone 164 of cam path 144. Spring 168 is compressed<br>
against the proximal end of cam nut 136. In the position shown in FIG. 14A,<br>
cutter 104 is in a fully retracted position such that port 86 in piercer 80 is open to<br>
receive tissue. In this position, a tissue sample may be retrieved from sample<br>
retrieval surface 74.<br>
FIG. 14B illustrates cutter 104 advanced to the third position in which cutting<br>
edge 116 is immediately proximal of tissue receiving port 86. In this position,<br>
cam nut 136 has translated along shaft 142 to a point where cam follower pin 152<br><br>
is transitioning from wider pitch portion 146 to finer pitch portion 148 of thread<br>
groove 144. Likewise, cutter 104 has advanced to an intermediate position in<br>
which drive shaft 122 is rotating the cutter via cutter gear teeth 120 and drive<br>
gear teeth 124. Cutter blade 116 is located in a position immediately proximal to<br>
port 86. Vacuum holes 92 in port 86 are open so that soft tissue adjacent to port<br>
86 can be pulled into the port when first vacuum tube 32 is fluidly connected to<br>
vacuum system 22.<br>
FIG. 14C illustrates cutter 104 advanced to the fourth position, in which the<br>
cutter is in the most extended position and cutting edge 116 is distal of port 86.<br>
In this position, cutter 104 is being rotated at an appropriate cutting speed by<br>
rotary drive shaft 122. Tissue pulled into port 86 by the vacuum through holes<br>
92 has been severed by the rotating, advancing cutter blade 116 and stored inside<br>
cutter lumen 114. When cutter 104 retracts back to the first position shown in<br>
FIG. 14A, tissue remover 115 draws the tissue sample back to sample retrieval<br>
surface 74. In FIG. 14C, cam nut 136 is shown in its most distal position, having<br>
translated through fine pitch portion 148 of cam path 144. In this position, cam<br>
follower pin 152 is engaged in no pitch zone 164 at the distal end of variable<br>
pitch cam slot 144. Spring 170 is compressed by cam nut 136 for biasing the<br>
cam nut back into engagement with fine pitch portion 148 of cam path 144 once<br>
the direction of rotation of translation shaft 142 is reversed, and cutter 104 is<br>
retracted back to position one.<br>
FIG. 15 is an exploded isometric view of a first embodiment of holster 30. In<br>
this embodiment, holster 30 is an integrally motorized holster in which two<br>
motors are supported for rotatably driving shafts 122, 142 in probe assembly 28.<br>
As mentioned above, holster 30 includes an upper shell 56 and a lower shell 58<br>
which may be shaped as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 to accommodate the motors<br><br>
and motor drive shafts enclosed therein. Upon final assembly, shells 56,58 are<br>
joined together by screws 180 fastened into a plurality of alignment holes 182, or<br>
attached together by another type of fastener well known in the art.<br>
A pair of motor drive shafts 134, 160 is contained within the proximal enclosed<br>
portion of holster 30. The first drive shaft 134 has a distal end 172 shaped to<br>
operatively engage slot 132 of rotary drive shaft 122. The second drive shaft 160<br>
has a distal end 162 shaped to operatively engage slot 158 of translation shaft<br>
142. Motor drive shafts 134,160 extend distally from a gear case 184 for<br>
engagement with drive and translation shafts 122, 142 when probe assembly 28<br>
and holster 30 are connected. A first drive motor 186 and second drive motor<br>
188 are mounted above gear case 184. First drive motor 186 provides rotary<br>
motion to drive shaft 134 through a gear assembly 190 shown in FIG. 16. The<br>
rotary motion produced in drive shaft 134 is transferred through distal end 172<br>
and slot 132 to rotary drive shaft 122 when probe assembly 28 and holster 30 are<br>
connected. Likewise, second drive motor 188 provides rotary motion to drive<br>
shaft 160 through a second gear assembly 192. The rotary motion of drive shaft<br>
160 is transferred to translation shaft 142 by the engagement between slot 158<br>
and distal shaft end 162. Motors 186 and 188 can be DC graphite brush motors,<br>
such as Model 118718 4.5 Watt motors available from Maxon Precision Motors<br>
of Sachsein, Switzerland. Motor 186 can be employed with a planetary gearhead<br>
Model 118184 available from Maxon, and Motor 188 can be employed wim a<br>
planetary gearhead Model 110322 available from Maxon.<br>
Referring to FIGS.16 and 17, first and second gear assemblies 190,192 are<br>
positioned at the proximal end of motors 186,188 and drive shafts 134,160, and<br>
are each comprised of a pair of gears interconnected by a belt. The separate<br>
connections between motors 186,188 and drive shafts 134, 160 enables the drive<br><br>
shafts to be separately driven at different time periods and at different speeds<br>
without the need for additional gearing. Further, because individual motors are<br>
used to drive shafts 134, 160 the motors may be smaller and less powerful than<br>
that required to drive both shafts in combination.<br>
Motors 186 and 188 can be supported in holster 30 in any convenient manner,<br>
such as, for example, by one or more supports 196 molded into holster lower<br>
shell 58. A switchboard 198 is provided in holster 30 and electrically interfaced<br>
with motors 186, 188 in any convenient manner. Switchboard 198 can also<br>
interface with various user interface switches such as rocker switch 72 and<br>
vacuum switch 76, as well as control cord 48 that provides power and control<br>
signals to holster 30 from control unit 24. Switch seals 200 and 202 comprised<br>
of a polymeric rubber or other suitable sealing material can be provided between<br>
switchboard 198 and adjacent components to prevent fluid from entering holster<br>
30 and affecting switchboard 198. A metal plate 204 can be provided, with<br>
mounting or connecting features to provide structural support within holster 30<br>
and/or facilitate fastening of the holster to probe assembly 28.<br>
The embodiment shown in FIGS. 15-17 comprises two integral motors mounted<br>
above gear case 184 and directly connected to motor drive shafts 134,160 for<br>
separately driving each shaft. In an alternative embodiment, such as shown in<br>
FIGS. 18-20, a single integral motor could be used to drive both the rotary drive<br>
shaft and the translation drive shaft through suitable gearing. In this<br>
embodiment, the single motor 208 may be mounted above gear case 184 and<br>
motor drive shafts 134, 160 in the proximal end of the holster. Motor 208 is<br>
operatively connected to drive shafts 134, 160 through a gear assembly 210.<br>
FIGS. 19 and 20 provide a rear view of the single motor assembly illustrating die<br>
interconnection between motor 208 and gear assembly 210. This interconnection<br><br>
includes a single belt 212 extending between gear 214 of motor shaft 216 and<br>
gear 218 of drive shaft 134. As shown in HG. 20, additional gears 220 are<br>
included in gear case 184 for driving translation shaft 160 from the rotation of<br>
rotary drive shaft 134. The additional gears 220 provide a gear reduction<br>
between the two drive shafts 134, 160 to enable translation drive shaft 160 to<br>
rotate at a slower speed than rotary drive shaft 134. Gears 220 could also be<br>
configured to enable translation drive shaft 160 to rotate at a faster speed than<br>
rotary drive shaft 134, or for the two shafts to rotate at the same speed, depending<br>
upon the desired operation of cutter 104. In addition to the two embodiments<br>
described above, the present invention could also comprise one or more integral<br>
motors positioned at the proximal end of holster 30 behind gear case 184, along<br>
the side or bottom portions of the holster, or in a forward end of the holster. In<br>
addition, one or more drive motors could be located external of the holster and<br>
operatively connected to rotary drive and translation shafts 122,142 by one or<br>
more rotatable shafts. Accordingly, the particular location of the motors in the<br>
present invention may be varied depending upon the desired size or weight<br>
distribution for the holster.<br>
FIGS. 21 and 22 illustrate probe assembly 28 for the second, single motor<br>
embodiment of the invention. In the single motor embodiment, both the rotary<br>
drive shaft 134 and translation drive shaft 160 are rotated during the entire<br>
operation of the device, since a common motor 208 acting through gears 214,<br>
218 and belt 212 drives the shafts simultaneously. To accommodate the<br>
continuous rotation of motor drive shaft 134, the rotary drive shaft 1.22 of the<br>
first embodiment is replaced with a modified drive shaft 222 having drive gear<br>
teeth 224 located proximate the distal end of the drive shaft. With gear teeth 224<br>
in this position, cutter gear 118 engages modified drive shaft 222 only after cutter<br>
104 has advanced distally to a position just proximal of tissue receiving port 86.<br><br>
When cutter gear 118 engages drive gear teeth 224, the gear teeth 120, 224 mesh<br>
and cutter 104 is rotated by drive shaft 222. Drive gear teeth 224 may include a<br>
lead-in ramp 254 molded in the proximal end of drive gear teeth 224. Ramp 254<br>
transitions gear teeth 120 into engagement with drive gear teeth 224 to provide a<br>
smooth meshing of the gears. Drive shaft 222 is modified in this manner for the<br>
single motor embodiment so that cutter 104 rotates only during the tissue-cutting<br>
phase of the cutter advance.<br>
Figure 23 shows vacuum system 22 in greater detail. As shown in FIG. 23,<br>
vacuum system 22 comprises a first valve 230 connected by a vacuum tube 232<br>
to first connecter 40. A second valve 234 is connected by a second vacuum tube<br>
236 to second connector 44. Valves 230,234 control the supply of vacuum to<br>
lateral vacuum line 32 and axial vacuum line 34 respectively. Valves 230, 234<br>
include solenoids that are controlled by signals from control unit 24 to open and<br>
close vacuum tubes 232,236 during operation of biopsy instrument 20. Each of<br>
the vacuum tubes 232,236 may be separately opened and closed at different<br>
intervals during an operation cycle. Vacuum lines 232, 236 extend from valves<br>
230,234 to a fluid reservoir, such as vacuum reservoir 240. A main vacuum line<br>
242 attaches reservoir 240 to a vacuum pump and chamber, indicated by numeral<br>
244, which is driven by a motor 246. Vacuum pump 244 may be of various<br>
types, such as, for example, a piston, diaphragm, rotary or rotary vane pump.<br>
Motor 246 is preferably of a type operable at variable speeds, such as, for<br>
example, a brushkss direct current motor. The speed of the motor can be<br>
controlled based on a pressure sensed in a fluid reservoir, such as a vacuum level<br>
in the vacuum reservoir 240. The speed of the motor may also be controlled<br>
based on upon an anticipated need for vacuum during an operation cycle, such as<br>
based on a schedule of desired cutter position.<br><br>
A muffler and baffling system 256 and exhaust port 258 extend from vacuum<br>
chamber 244 to reduce noise and vent the system. An additional vacuum tube<br>
248 extends from vacuum reservoir 240 to a vacuum pressure sensor 250.<br>
Sensor 250 monitors the vacuum pressure in reservoir 240 and periodically<br>
transmits a pressure signal 252 to control system 24. Control system 24 includes<br>
a printed circuit board (PCB) with a microprocessor or microcontroller 254 for<br>
controlling motor 246 in relation to the pressure signal 252 from sensor 250.<br>
In one embodiment, microcontroller 254 maintains a consistent, desired vacuum<br>
pressure in reservoir 240 by adjusting the speed of motor 246 in relation to<br>
pressure signal 252 from sensor 250. The motor speed may be adjusted by<br>
altering the current, voltage or torque of the motor to vary the vacuum pump<br>
speed, and/or turn the vacuum pump on and off. In one embodiment, while the<br>
pressure within reservoir 240 is at a desired preset level, microcontroller 254<br>
idles motor 246 so that vacuum pump 244 is not operating to create additional<br>
vacuum (and noise) within the system. When pressure signal 252 from sensor<br>
250 indicates a drop in pressure within reservoir 240, such as when one or both<br>
valves 230,234 are opened, microcontroUer 254 will activate motor 246 to turn<br>
pump 244 on until the pressure in reservoir 240 again reaches the desired level.<br>
Sensor 250 thereby provides a closed-loop control for vacuum system 22 that<br>
maintains the desired vacuum pressure within the system without the need to<br>
continuously operate vacuum pump 244. La an alternative embodiment,<br>
microcontroller 254 drives motor 246 to operate vacuum pump 244 based upon<br>
the anticipated need for vacuum during an operation cycle of biopsy instrument<br>
20. Microcontroller 254 may be preprogrammed to operate the vacuum pump at<br>
different positions in the operation cycle. Accordingly, microcontroller 254 may<br>
increase the motor speed in anticipation of a need for vacuum such as, for<br>
example, when a user initiates a tissue sampling cycle by activating forward<br><br>
rocker switch 72. Microcontroller 254 may vary the speed of motor 246 to<br>
increase or decrease vacuum depending upon the location of cutter 104 between<br>
positions one through four of the operation cycle. In one embodiment, the<br>
pressure in the reservoir 240 can be about -26.5 inches Hg (about 26.5 inches of<br>
Mercury below the local atmospheric pressure).<br>
If desired a pressurized reservoir can be employed, and a pressure sensor and<br>
compressor can be used to maintain the pressure in the pressurized reservoir at a<br>
desired level above atmospheric pressure by using a closed loop control method<br>
as set forth above. For instance, in an alternative embodiment reservoir 240 can<br>
be a pressurized reservoir, and pump 244 can be a compressor for providing<br>
pressurized air to reservoir 240. For example, it may be desirable to<br>
pneumatically drive translation and/or rotation of the cutter with a positive<br>
pressure (or with a pressure differential employing vacuum), or to provide a<br>
pressurized flow of fluid (gas or liquid) through the cutter lumen. Alternatively,<br>
a vacuum reservoir 240 can be employed for providing vacuum in association<br>
with the cutter, and one or more separate pressurized reservoirs and associated<br>
compressors can be employed for providing motion of the cutter. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the reservoir 240 could be employed as a vacuum reservoir during<br>
one portion of the operation of the biopsy device, and as a pressurized reservoir<br>
during another portion of the operation of the biopsy device.<br>
FIGS. 24A-24E provide a flow diagram of a control method according to the<br>
present invention for controlling the operation of cutter 104 as the cutter moves<br>
through the four distinct positions described above. The steps of the control<br>
method are represented schematically in the flow diagrams. Each box in the flow<br>
diagrams may represent one step or more man one step. For discussion purpose,<br>
each box is referred to simply as a step. Progression of the steps occurs generally<br><br>
in the direction of the arrows connecting the boxes. The control method<br>
described below may be used with biopsy instruments having a single motor, or<br>
two or more motors for separately driving the cutter translation and rotation, such<br>
as in the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-17.<br>
Referring to FIG. 24A, step 410 represents the beginning of the control method.<br>
When biopsy instrument 20 is activated for use, such as by selecting either a<br>
sampling or manual operation mode, a control signal is transmitted through<br>
power cord 48 to switchboard 198. Switchboard 198 in turn directs that a pulse<br>
width modulation (PWM) drive signal be supplied to motor 188 to initiate<br>
rotation of translation drive shaft 160. The rotation of translation drive shaft 160<br>
is transmitted to translation shaft 142 through the interconnection of distal end<br>
162 and slot 158. As translation shaft 142 rotates, cam nut 136 begins to<br>
translate cutter 104 from position one to position two due to the action of cam<br>
follower pin 152 in variable pitch thread groove 144. The translation of cam nut<br>
136 along translation shaft 142 continues in step 412.<br>
At step 414, a predetermined time value stored in a reprogrammable memory in<br>
control unit 24 is read and compared to an accumulated time count stored in a<br>
temporary memory. The reprogrammable memory may be, for example, a<br>
"flash" memory that is contained in a microcontroller such as, for example, a<br>
PIC18F452 manufactured by Microchip Corporation. The predetermined time<br>
value corresponds to a designated position in the cutter translation path. The<br>
accumulated time count in temporary memory is updated by the microcontroller<br>
at approximately equal time intervals. In one embodiment, the time intervals can<br>
be less than or equal to about 100 milliseconds, more particularly less than or<br>
equal to about 50 milliseconds, and in one embodiment about 25 ms. The time<br>
count is derived from the actual time cutter 104 is translating through the relative<br><br>
positions one through four, plus (or minus) the time period calculated from a<br>
motor voltage comparison that will be described in more detail below. When the<br>
time count in temporary memory matches the predetermined time value, cutter<br>
104 is deemed to be at position two. If the temporary time count does not match<br>
the predetermined time value for position two, then cutter 104 is not deemed to<br>
be at position two, and the operation proceeds to step 416.<br>
At step 416, the present translation current is read from translation motor 188.<br>
At step 418, the present translation current reading is compared against a<br>
predetermined current limit stored in the flash memory. If the current reading is<br>
greater than the predetermined current limit, an error condition is determined to<br>
exist. The operation of translation motor 188 is stopped, and an error message is<br>
reported on a user interface at step 420. If at step 418 the present translation<br>
current reading is equal to or below the predetermined current limit, the control<br>
method proceeds to step 422.<br>
At step 422, the present translation current reading is compared with a<br>
predetermined current value stored in a reprogrammable memory referred to<br>
hereinafter as the "current LUT" (Look-Up-Table). The current LUT comprises<br>
a representative current profile for each of the motors 186, 188. The current<br>
profile is derived from experimental and empirical data related to motor<br>
operation and drive current The current profile is segmented into time intervals<br>
corresponding to the time intervals of the microprocessor, which in the<br>
exemplary embodiment described herein is 25ms. The location in the current<br>
LUT of the predetermined current value to be used in the comparison is<br>
dependent upon the accumulated time count value at the time of the comparison.<br>
FIG. 25 illustrates an exemplary motor current profile 260 as cutter 104 traverses<br>
a complete cycle from position one to position four, and then back again to<br><br>
position one. In FIG. 25, current profile 260 is shown as motor current (vertical<br>
axis) verses time (horizontal axis). As shown by profile 260, the current to motor<br>
188 varies between time increments and between each of the four cutter<br>
positions. The current LUT comprises the current level of profile 260 at each<br>
segmented time interval.<br>
In addition to the current measurement, at step 422 the voltage of translation<br>
motor 188 is read during the off-cycle of the PWM motor drive signal. This<br>
voltage is proportional to the back electromechanical force of motor 188, as well<br>
as the linear travel speed of cutter 104. From the voltage reading, the actual<br>
position of cam nut 136 along the travel path and, thus, the position of cutter 104<br>
can be determined. The voltage reading from motor 188 may be compared to the<br>
motor specifications, or a predetermined operational profile, to determine the<br>
actual travel speed from the voltage reading. If the motor voltage reading at the<br>
accumulated time count exceeds the anticipated voltage for the time count, then<br>
cutter 104 is deemed to be at a more advanced position in the current profile than<br>
that anticipated for the accumulated time count. Accordingly, the position of the<br>
pointer in the current LUT may be adjusted to account for the difference in<br>
distance by increasing the accumulated time count, and thereby retarding the<br>
total advance time for the cutter. Likewise, if the motor voltage reading is less<br>
than the predetermined level for the accumulated time count, then the cutter is<br>
deemed to have not traveled as far along the current profile as anticipated by the<br>
accumulated time count. The position of the pointer in the current LUT may<br>
therefore be adjusted to account for the difference in travel distance by reducing<br>
the accumulated time count and, therefore, rereading or moving backwards in the<br>
current LUT and increasing the total advance time for the cutter.<br><br>
At step 424, a comparison is made to determine if the difference between the<br>
present translation current and the current value from the current LUT is outside<br>
a predetermined range, such as the range indicated by dashed line 262 in FIG. 25.<br>
If the difference between the current values is outside the predetermined range,<br>
the current to translation motor 188 is adjusted at step 426, such as by increasing<br>
or decreasing the duty cycle of the pulse width modulated motor control signal<br>
(or by changing a voltage level if an analog motor drive is employed rather than<br>
PWM). If the difference between the present translation current and the<br>
predetermined current LUT value is determined at step 424 to be within the<br>
acceptable range, then the process returns to step 412 and cutter 104 continues<br>
translating from position one to position two.<br>
If at step 414 cutter 104 is deemed to be at position two, then the control method<br>
passes to step 428 shown in FIG. 24B, and the cutter continues translating from<br>
position two to position three. At step 430, a check is made to determine if cutter<br>
104 has reached a predetermined intermediate position between position two and<br>
position three. Cutter 104 is deemed to have reached the intermediate position<br>
when the accumulated time count in temporary memory matches a predetermined<br>
time count corresponding to the intermediate position. The predetermined<br>
intermediate position is based on the actual cutter translation speed and the<br>
predetermined cutter rotation speed. The intermediate position is selected to<br>
allow a sufficient amount of time for cutter 104 to accelerate from zero to the<br>
predetermined rotation speed before cutter 104 has reached position three, after<br>
which tissue cutting begins. If at step 430 cutter 104 has not reached the<br>
intermediate position, then the present translation current from motor 188 is read<br>
at step 432.<br><br>
At step 434, the present translation current is again compared to a predetermined<br>
current limit stored in the flash memory. If the present translation current<br>
reading is greater than the predetermined current limit, an error condition is<br>
determined to exist. The operation of translation motor 188 is stopped, and an<br>
error message is reported on a user interface at step 436. If at step 434 me<br>
present translation current is determined to be equal to or below the<br>
predetermined current limit, operation of instrument 20 continues at step 438. At<br>
step 438, the present translation motor current reading is again compared with a<br>
predetermined value in the current LUT. Once again, the location of the<br>
comparison value in the current LUT is dependent upon the updated accumulated<br>
time count at the time of the comparison. Also, at step 438 the present motor<br>
voltage is read and compared with the anticipated voltage based upon the<br>
updated accumulated time count. If the actual voltage reading differs from the<br>
anticipated voltage, then the accumulated time count is increased or decreased to<br>
synchronize the current LUT position with the actual position of the cutter. If at<br>
step 440 the difference between the present and predetermined current values is<br>
outside a predetermined range, the current to translation motor 188 is adjusted at<br>
step 442. If the difference from the comparison at step 440 is within the<br>
predetermined range, then cutter 104 continues translating from position two to<br>
position three at its present rate at step 428.<br>
If at step 430 cutter 104 is determined to have reached the intermediate point<br>
between position two and position three, then the cutter continues to translate<br>
towards position three and the rotation of the cutter is started at step 444 shown<br>
in FIG. 24C. At step 446, the present rotation current is read for rotary drive<br>
motor 186. At step 448, a comparison is made to determine if the present<br>
rotation motor current is greater than a predetermined current limit stored in the<br>
flash memory. If the present current reading is greater than the predetermined<br><br>
limit, then the rotation and translation motors 186, 188 are stopped at step 460,<br>
and an error condition is reported on the user interface. If the present rotation<br>
current reading is equal to or below the predetermined limit, then the operation<br>
continues to the next step. At step 450, the present rotation current reading is<br>
compared with a predetermined current value loaded into the current LUT. As<br>
mentioned above, the location of the comparison value in the current LUT is<br>
dependent upon the accumulated time count at the time of the comparison. If at<br>
step 452 the difference of the comparison is determined to be outside a<br>
predetermined range, the current to the rotation motor 186 is adjusted at step 454.<br>
If at step 452 the difference between the present current value and the<br>
predetermined current value is within a predetermined range, then rotation of<br>
cutter 104 continues.<br>
At step 456, a predetermined time value stored in memory in the microcontroller<br>
is compared to the accumulated time count stored in the temporary memory. The<br>
accumulated time count is derived from the actual time the cutter is moving<br>
through its relative position plus (or minus) the time calculated from the motor<br>
voltage comparisons at steps 422,438 and 464. When the accumulated time<br>
count matches the stored time count, cutter 104 is determined to be at the third<br>
position. If cutter 104 is not at the third position, the process continues to step<br>
458, where the present translation current is read from motor 188. At step 462,<br>
the present translation current reading is compared against a predetermined<br>
current limit. If the present current reading is greater than the predetermined<br>
limit, the translation and rotation motors are stopped an4 an error is reported at<br>
step 460.<br>
If the reading is equal to or below the limit, the process continues at step 464,<br>
where the present current reading is compared with a predetermined value loaded<br><br>
into the current LUT. The location of the comparison value in the current LUT is<br>
dependent on the updated accumulated time count at the time of the comparison.<br>
Also, at step 464 the actual motor voltage is compared with the anticipated<br>
voltage. The accumulated time count is increased or decreased as described<br>
above to account for an increase or decrease in the motor voltage corresponding<br>
to a change in the actual travel speed of cutter 104. If at step 466 the difference<br>
between the present current reading and the predetermined current value from the<br>
current LOT is determined to be within an allowable range, then translation of<br>
cutter 104 continues, and the process proceeds to step 446. If the difference from<br>
the comparison is outside the predetermined allowable range, then the current to<br>
translation motor 468 is adjusted. After this adjustment, the process continues to<br>
step 446.<br>
When it has been determined at step 456 that cutter 104 has reached position<br>
three, then the process proceeds to step 470 shown in FIG. 24D, At step 470, the<br>
translation current to motor 188 is changed to a predetermined value and stored<br>
in the memory. The changed current value continues the translation of cutter 104<br>
towards the fourth position, but at a different velocity, typically 0.5 inches per<br>
second. At step 472, a predetermined value stored in the reprogrammable<br>
memory in the microcontroller is compared to the accumulated time count stored<br>
in the temporary memory. The time count is derived from the actual time cutter<br>
104 is moving through its relative positions plus (or minus) the time calculated<br>
from the motor voltage comparisons. When the present time count matches the<br>
stored time count, it is deemed that the cutter is at position four.<br>
At step 474, the present translation current is read. At step 476, the translation<br>
current reading is compared against a predetermined current limit. If the<br>
translation current reading is greater than the predetermined limit, the process<br><br>
moves to step 482, where the translation and rotation motors 186, 188 are<br>
stopped and an error message is displayed. If at step 476 the present translation<br>
current reading is less than or equal to the limit, the process continues to step<br>
478. At step 478, the motor voltage is read and compared to a predetermined<br>
motor voltage level. If the voltage reading is higher than anticipated, then the<br>
accumulated time count is increased to account for an increase in travel speed. If<br>
the voltage reading is lower than anticipated, the accumulated time count is<br>
decreased to account for a decrease in the actual travel speed of the cutter. Also<br>
at step 478, the present translation current reading is compared with a<br>
predetermined value loaded into the current LUT. If at step 480 the difference<br>
between the present and predetermined current values is determined to be outside<br>
of a predefined range, the current is adjusted to the translation motor 186 at step<br>
484. If at step 480 the difference between the present and predetermined current<br>
values is within a predetermined range, then cutter 104 continues translating and<br>
the process moves to step 486. At step 486, the present rotation current is again<br>
read, and at step 488 the latest current reading is compared against a<br>
predetermined limit. If die current reading is greater than the predetermined<br>
limit, translation and rotation motors 186, 188 are stopped and an error reported<br>
at step 482. If the present rotation current reading is equal to or below the<br>
predetermined limit, then operation continues on to the next step. At step 490,<br>
the present rotation motor current is again compared with a predetermined value<br>
loaded into the current LUT, and the difference between the two levels is<br>
calculated. If the difference in the current levels is determined at step 492 to be<br>
outside a predetermined range, then the current is adjusted to the rotation motor<br>
at step 494. If at step 492 the difference between the two current levels is<br>
determined to be within a predetermined range, then cutter rotation continues,<br>
and the process moves to step 472.<br><br>
If at step 472, cutter 104 has reached position four, then the control method<br>
continues to step 496 shown in FIG. 24E, at which point translation motor 188 is<br>
stopped. Next, at step 498, a predetermined value stored in the microcontroller is<br>
compared to the accumulated time count stored in the temporary memory. The<br>
time count is derived from the actual time the rotation motor was turned on plus<br>
(or minus) time adjustments calculated from the motor voltage comparisons. If<br>
at step 498 the time count comparison does not match the stored time count, then<br>
the actual rotation motor current is read at step 500. At step 502, the actual<br>
rotation motor current is compared with a predetermined value loaded into the<br>
current LUT, with the location of the comparison value in the current LUT being<br>
dependent on the time count interval value at the time of the comparison. If it is<br>
determined at step 504 that the difference between the actual rotation motor<br>
current and the predetermined value for the rotation current is outside a<br>
predetermined range, then the current to rotation motor 186 is adjusted at step<br>
506. If the difference from the comparison is within the predetermined range,<br>
then the control method proceeds to step 498. At step 498, the predetermined<br>
time count is compared to the accumulated time count for rotation motor 186. If<br>
the accumulated time count exceeds the predetermined value, then the rotation<br>
motor is stopped at step 508.<br>
