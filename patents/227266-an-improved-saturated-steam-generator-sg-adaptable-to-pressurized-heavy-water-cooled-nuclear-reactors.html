				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to natural circulation, vertical and integral steam<br>
drum type steam generators (hereinafter referred to as SG) generating dry<br>
saturated steam. Particularly the invention relates to steam generators adaptable<br>
to pressurized heavy water cooled nuclear reactors. Particularly, the invention<br>
concerns the modifications and changes in design configurations employable on<br>
typical SG's so as to augment their performance and up-rate their capacity and<br>
performance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Natural circulation steam generators are increasingly being used to generate<br>
steam from the heat available with process fluids, which is further utilized to<br>
drive a turbine and generate electricity. The transport of energy from this type of<br>
steam generators is usually through saturated steam. One such typical general<br>
arrangement of a steam generator is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The configuration of the Boiler and Drum sections in such a typical steam<br>
generator is influenced by the various device characteristics for example, the<br>
primary side fluid that usually flows inside the steam generator tubes, its mass<br>
flow rate, the fluid quality, temperature and its pressure; the secondary side<br>
water flow, which usually flows outside the tube bundle of the SG, its flow rate,<br>
its feed temperature; capacity of the steam separator, re-circulation ratio, steam<br>
pressure and the water level in the drum.<br>
During the "high-reactor-power" phase, owing to hotter primary fluid conditions,<br>
more steam is likely to be produced around the tube bundle. Since the volume of<br>
the steam generator is fixed, owing to swelling vapour volumes, the liquid level<br>
rises in the drum; i.e. increased power output is reflected by an increase in water<br><br>
level. Alternatively, in the "low-reactor-power" phase, the water level in steam<br>
drum reduces. Thus, for a given reactor and with a selected SG capacity, and a<br>
predetermined operating condition, the normal water level is somewhat fixed.<br>
The power rating of the continuous steam producing capacity of such a SG is<br>
subject to technical limitations as explained hereinunder. The sizing of the drum<br>
section is normally larger than that of the boiler section, the sizing being<br>
primarily decided by the number of steam separators required for a given<br>
evaporation rate corresponding to the maximum rating of steam generator. The<br>
height of the drum is primarily decided by the recirculation ratio of the feed<br>
water and the water level needed to be maintained for safer operation of the<br>
steam generator at various power loads. Size of the drum is further influenced by<br>
the number of separators including the disposition of the separators allowing<br>
optimum access to the drum internals. A still further factor influences the sizing<br>
of the drum which constitutes provisions for a feed water line including space<br>
provisions for fabrication, maintenance and inspection of the above components.<br>
For the steam generator shown in Fig. 1, atleast 23 steam separators are<br>
disposed on the deck plate with a provision for accommodating feed water pipe<br>
and the deck plate manhole. The separators are eccentrically arranged with<br>
reference to the drum axis as the feed water line crosses the separator deck<br>
plate. Because of the above interference, the configuration of the cone is also<br>
made asymmetric and eccentric.<br>
For any chosen configuration and the chosen operating parameters, the SG can<br>
generate rated steam flow corresponding to a specified power output value, say<br>
X Mw. With all other parameters remaining unchanged, the power output can be<br>
said to be tightly linked to the number of steam separators and the drum size. If<br>
only any one of them or both can be increased, the steam generator rate and<br>
hence the power output will also increase. However, other limitations for<br><br>
example, structural strength and design complication usually does not allow<br>
drum size to increase.<br>
Alternatively, there is a possibility of accepting the hot process fluid at a still<br>
higher heat condition or at higher 'enthalpy', which can be fed into the SG for<br>
production of higher flow rate of steam in the boiler section. Parametric studies<br>
show that any boiler section of the SG has an inherent capability of accepting<br>
higher input and can generate higher steam water mixture and send it to the<br>
drum section. A typical boiler section as shown in fig. 1 has the capability to<br>
generate higher steam water mixture to the tune of 30-40% more in terms of<br>
mass flow rate. To accommodate the higher steam water mixture so produced in<br>
the drum section, the drum size as well as number of separators have to be<br>
increased. Such a solution, however, gives rise to a plurality of basic constraints,<br>
for example, to accommodate higher number of separators and higher capacity<br>
internals, the size of the separator deck plate and drum inner diameter have to<br>
be in turn increased. The changes in the drum size can have several<br>
repercussions on the plant design and the manufacturing process of higher<br>
diameter drum shell and dished ends by forging process.<br>
Since the primary source is capable of supplying higher quantity of energy it is<br>
often desired to harness this quality heat energy and thereby generate higher<br>
power from the same steam generator. It is also a standard industry practice to<br>
keep high redundancy on all critical components, so as to ensure uninterrupted<br>
availability. Normally nuclear utility operators keep a couple of spare pressure<br>
boundary components of steam generators always. Costlier pressure boundary<br>
components like drum shell, drum dished ends, tube-sheet and boiler shells<br>
pertaining to a particular Steam Generator of standard capacity are often<br>
procured and kept as a ready stock. To be capable of using the stocked and<br>
costlier pressure boundary components indirectly makes it mandatory to consider<br><br>
up-rating without any change In dimensions of the SG components. This<br>
invention precisely explains how the task of up-rating is accomplished with the<br>
existing components itself and minimal changes.<br>
USPAT# 4,200,061: Titled, "Steam generator for nuclear power plant", discloses<br>
an arrangement, especially for pressurized water reactors. This patent deals with<br>
introduction of flange connection at the tube sheet and the middle section boiler<br>
drum for easy assembling and dismantling in case of maintenance of steam<br>
generator.<br>
USPAT# 6,408,800: Titled "Separator for water/steam separating apparatus",<br>
deals with design details of separator components.<br>
USPAT#6,044,804: Titled "Method and device for monitoring feed water supply<br>
to a steam generator", deals with the method and device for monitoring a feed<br>
water supply and control for a fossil-fuel fired natural circulation type steam<br>
generator.<br>
Thus, none of the existing art suggests or teaches an improved steam generator<br>
device adaptable to pressurized heavy-water cooled nuclear reactors which has<br>
been capacitivity upgraded without replacing or modifying the critical<br>
components of the steam generator.<br>
Up-rating with the existing configuration of standard sized steam generator<br>
poses perceptible limitations of steam separation capacity. It is generally not<br>
possible to accommodate a higher number of steam separators that are fixed on<br>
to the separator deck plate (SDP), which in turn is fitted on to the upper portion<br>
of the conical shroud. Accommodating larger number of steam separators<br>
warrant increasing the shroud diameter.<br><br>
But the presence of feed water inlet nozzle pipe within the drum internal space<br>
severely restricts such an increasingly size of shroud. Larger openings cut on the<br>
SDP, to accommodate larger feed water line would also further reduce the space<br>
availability for placing of separator evenly on the SDP, which eventually could<br>
result in non-uniform steam separation performance.<br>
As a general practice, the separator deck plate (SDP) and the cone used at the<br>
upper part of the shroud are arranged eccentrically with respect to steam<br>
generator axis. Manufacturing of such an asymmetrical cone will be difficult and<br>
costlier.<br>
The gap width between the SDP and steam generator wall also varies with<br>
height. This would cause different re-circulation water flow in the annular down<br>
comer.<br>
To accommodate a larger number steam separators to generate higher power<br>
output the drum diameter has to increased. However, for an operating plant that<br>
needs to up-rated, accommodation of larger drum diameter will be very difficult<br>
within the given plant layout.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved steam<br>
generator adaptable to pressurized-heavy water-cooled nuclear reactors which<br>
utilizes the heat energy of the primary side fluid to generate higher power from<br>
the steam generator.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an improved steam generator<br>
adaptable to pressurized-heavy water-cooled nuclear reactors which increases<br>
the capacity of the steam generator without causing redundancy of the critical<br>
components of the generator, thereby exercising economy in capacity up-<br>
gradation.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide an improved steam generator<br>
adaptable to pressurized-heavy water-cooled nuclear reactors which is capable of<br>
generating comprehensively higher steam-production rate without necessitating<br>
replacement, or major reconfiguration of the critical components of the steam<br>
generator.<br>
An yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved steam generator<br>
adaptable to pressurized-heavy water-cooled nuclear reactors which is<br>
configured basically through optimization of components layout.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an improved saturated steam generator (SG)<br>
adaptable to pressurized heavy-water-cooled nuclear reactors, the steam<br>
generator (SG) comprising a drum section; a boiler section; a primary fluid<br>
passage formed by a bundle of inverted 'U'-tubes passing through a tube sheet<br><br>
to which the bundle of inverted 'U'-tubes are rigidly fixed, the primary fluid being<br>
a hot medium containing substantial heat energy; a secondary fluid passage<br>
configured by the outer surface of the U-tubes, the outer shell of the boiler<br>
section, and a thin down-comer shroud, the secondary fluid exchanging heat<br>
from the primary fluid to form water-steam mixture, the shroud being fixed with<br>
a separator deck plate and accommodating a plurality of steam separators; and<br>
atleast two numbers feed flow nozzles provided on the drum section being<br>
disposed in diametrically-opposed locations, the improvement is characterized in<br>
that: the height of the drum section is selected to be H + 2/5 H wherein 'H' is<br>
the standard height of the drum section and the incremental length is<br>
determined by the thermal design, the thin down-comer shroud is configured as<br>
a regular conical section being disposed concentric to the drum-section axis, and<br>
having a length atleast of L + 2/5 L, wherein 'L' is the length of the shroud<br>
corresponding to the standard height of the drum section , the atleast two feed-<br>
water inlet nozzle provided each being configured to have reduced diameter<br>
thereby occupying lesser overall space around the shroud; said separator deck<br>
plate accommodating atleast n + 3/10 n standard sized steam separators,<br>
thereby increasing the steam production rate of the improved steam generator<br>
(SG).<br>
The drum diameter remaining the same, its length is increased above the<br>
knuckle transition. The conical shroud length is also made to increase. The feed<br>
nozzle is split into two pipes, mounted diametrically opposed to each other on<br>
either end. Doubling the feed line quantity causes individual feed line diameter to<br>
reduce. As the conical shroud top goes above the feed nozzle location, its radial<br>
size is enlarged to the maximum that can be accommodated in the annular<br>
space. This in turn enables the separator deck plate to accommodate additional<br>
numbers of steam separators which enhance the dry steam production rate,<br>
thereby increasing the overall steam rate.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Constructional features of a typical conventional steam generator can be<br>
described with fig. 1. The steam generator consists of two major functional<br>
sections. The upper portion forms the drum section (1) where the saturated<br>
steam water mixture from the boiler section collects and gets separated. The<br>
lower portion of the steam generator is termed 'Boiler section' (2) where the hot<br>
process fluid passes through the inverted vertical U-tube bundle (4) fixed to the<br>
tube sheet (3).<br>
The primary fluid entering a right-side bottom inlet chamber (10) and flows<br>
through the bundle of U-tubes (4) connected to the tube sheet (3) at the bottom<br>
of the steam generator and flows out through an outlet (left) chamber.<br>
On the secondary side feed water enters at the middle section of the steam<br>
generator, i.e. above the end of the U-end of the tube. Feed water mixes with<br>
the water returned by the steam separator and flows down to the bottom end of<br>
steam generator through an annular path formed between a shroud (5) and a<br>
linear surface of the steam generator (2). The length of the shroud (5) is<br>
predetermined in relation to the length of the boiler section (2), for example, 'L'.<br>
The heat exchanged from the primary fluid heats up and boils the secondary side<br>
fluid creating a two-phase flow around the tube bundle (4). The vapour phase of<br>
flow gradually increases in quality (Quality of vapour is definable as the mass<br>
ratio of vapour quantity to the overall fluid quantity) towards the steam drum<br>
section (1). When the water and steam mixture moves past the tube bend at the<br>
top, the quality of the mixture reach approximately 25% (i.e., 25% of the<br>
mixture is dry steam by weight). The mixture then passes through a separator<br>
deck plate, SDP (8), and a plurality of centrifugal steam separators (7) for<br><br>
example, n- numbers fixed on to the SDP (8), where the primary stage of<br>
separation takes place. And the steam reaches around 95% purity at this<br>
juncture.<br>
The steam drum section (1) primarily consists of plurality of steam separators<br>
(7), for example, n- number steam drier (9), a feed water supply line (6), a<br>
distribution header (13), several drain lines and other internals housed in the<br>
upper section. The steam water mixture from the boiler (2) enters the steam<br>
separator (7), where major quantity of water is separated from the mixture. The<br>
distribution header (13) having a pre-selected diameter (D).<br>
The relatively higher quality vapour mixture then enters a corrugated plate type<br>
steam drier (9) and then through a perforated sheet (not shown in figure), which<br>
is kept at the top section of the steam drum, the liquid phase of the fluid is<br>
separated here resulting in 99.75%, dry steam passing out of the steam<br>
generator through a nozzle (12) and to be ducted to a steam turbine in turn.<br>
The 'make up' feed water flow, to compensate the steam that has been<br>
evaporated from the water, along with the saturated water separated at the<br>
steam separators (7) and the return water from the turbine are admitted at the<br>
top section of the boiler (2) through a nozzle (6) and further conveyed down to<br>
the bottom of tube bundle (4) via a ring header (13) and the down corner (5)<br>
completing the circulation loop.<br>
The water separated from the primary separator and the drier mixes with the<br>
feed water injection and flows down through an annular gap all the way down up<br>
to the tube sheet (3). The annular gap is made up of the space between the thin<br>
shroud (5) around and the tube bundle (4) and the inside surface of the boiler<br>
section (2). The difference in the static head between the saturated fluid from<br>
the down-comer and less dense two-phase flow in the riser section creates the<br>
driving force for natural circulation within the steam generator.<br><br>
The feed water flows to the bottom and takes an upward direction and rises over<br>
the tube bundle (4) again and continues to pick up the heat from the primary<br>
coolant.<br>
A liquid level (15) inside the drum section (1) is critically maintained by matching<br>
the steam evaporation rate and the feed water flow rate.<br>
Fig.2 shows only the salient features of an up-rated steam generator, which<br>
incorporates the inventive modifications to aid-up rating process. Compared to<br>
the configuration in fig. 1, the arrangement as depicted in fig.2 significantly<br>
varies in the following aspects. The drum section (1) is made taller, the liquid<br>
level (15) is significantly higher measured from the knuckle transition of the<br>
boiler and drum sections. The conical shroud (5) is also made larger in diameter<br>
at the top and longer from the boiler top end, the funnel like top of the shroud<br>
and the separator deck plate (8) being coaxial rather than eccentric to the drum<br>
axis, the feed water inlet nozzle (6) is made smaller in diameter, but instead of<br>
one, a pair of nozzles cater to the feed water make up process. This also<br>
promotes a smaller sized ring header (13) to be employed and a more uniform<br>
circumferential distribution of feed water. The separator deck plate (8)<br>
accommodates more than the 30% additional number of steam separator<br>
assemblies (7), the top end of the conical shroud (5) goes above the feed water<br>
nozzle entry location, thereby avoiding complicated 'cut-outs' made in the SDP<br>
and space left out to facilitate this pipe's location, the steam separators (7)<br>
themselves being located at a higher elevation and in an unencumbered manner.<br>
The higher number of steam separators, dual feed nozzles and larger diameter<br>
shroud together make the steam generator accept inflows of hotter primary fluid<br>
and also sustains higher rates of boiling on the secondary fluid side, thus feeding<br>
a higher steam (vapour) flow throughput to the steam turbine feed line. As<br>
indicated, the collective effect of the modifications achieve a higher performance<br>
for any chosen primary/secondary fluid combinations.<br><br><br>
