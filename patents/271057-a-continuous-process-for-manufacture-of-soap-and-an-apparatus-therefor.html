				<td>This invention relates to An Apparatus for continuous Manufacture of Soap and a continuous process there for.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention particularly relates to an apparatus for Manufacture of Soap Continuously. The apparatus of this invention is completely automated. The apparatus of this invention enables cooling of the soap from all sides using moulds having means for better heat conduction thereby maintaining the quality of the product.<br>
The invention also provides a continuous process adaptable to manufacture soap bars having various shapes and sizes by appropriately using mould of varied size and shape. Further, the invention provides a process of continuous manufacture that yields soap of differentiated properties more specifically the properties resident in all soaps made from the casting route e.g. in use feel, grit, transparency, soaps with large quantities of do good ingredients, which are not amenable to processing on conventional soap processing lines. Specifically, the invention provides a continuous process for opaque, translucent and transparent soap that is user friendly cost effective having higher production rates, adaptable for varied compositions &amp; shapes without compromise on the essential properties resident in all soaps as herein after described. The process specifically adopts casting process by using an efficient combination of conductive and convective heat transfer coefficients employing cool air.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Soaps can be categorized on the basis of their transparency. Transparent soap is one having a wide degree of colour and gloss but which are sufficiently transparent so that with a normal vision one can effectively see through a toilet sized bar. Specifically, if 14 point type can be seen through a '/4 inch thick bar of soap that bar of soap is defined as a transparent one. The second category include those which do not allow any transparency and are thus categorized as opaque, while the third category is the one, which include<br>
soaps that are neither opaque nor transparent. The third category would be ones that are neither opaque nor transparent and named as translucent.<br>
Process of producing transparent soaps has many stringent requirements, which include the selection of the starting materials and strict operational controls. Every ingredient has to be pure, colourless and compatible in the system such that the resultant product appears as an un-tinted glass. All the ingredients form a homogenous and transparent medium, unlike the other soaps, utilizing the soap noodles to blend with additives like extract, perfume and colour.<br>
As a result of all these strict requirements, the advantages provided by transparent soaps are transparent appearance, good moisturizing and rinsability, high glycerin content, no excess alkali, good homogeneity and vast variation allowing many additives.<br>
However, transparent soaps pose a different set of problems. In order to acquire its attractive and clear appearance, it is made through a more vigorous casting process, which usually takes more than one week to complete. Conventionally the soaps made from the casting route are batch solidified and cooled using batch-wise conductive heat transfer designs. Hence, extensive manual work is required. This limits the quantity of soap, which can potentially be manufactured or requires large capital investments and manual intervention to manufacture large quantities.<br>
Traditional transparent soap such as "Pears" is produced by prolonged evaporation and drying from an alcoholic liquid soap in a process taking up to three months. The characteristic concave shape of the soap tablet is achieved not by moulding but by shrinkage in the drying process.<br>
The production of transparent soaps worldwide remained a batch process; continuous production without serious aesthetic defects (i.e. loss of transparency) had not been obtained till recently.<br>
The relevant prior art i.e. a continuous process for manufacture of soap, known to the inventor include US patent 4758370 ('370) US'370 describes compositions and a continuous process for manufacture of transparent soap which is more efficient and economical than any of the earlier processes. In accordance with US'370, the process involves continuous saponification of a mild transparent soap which is quicker, more easily controlled, conserves energy and produces a more uniform product with lighter color and superior fragrance stability than heretofore obtainable. The process is specifically designed for transparent soaps and involves dual tank procedure, two different mixtures heated in different tanks before mixing stoichiometrically. Further, these mixtures are passed through preheated tanks moulded and then chilled for achieving the soap bars. However, when the bar comes out of the chilled chamber fails to get cooled on the reverse side. It also has to be further processed for finishing purposes.<br>
US Patent No. US 2,005,160 disclose a method for making transparent soap containing rosin but no alcohol or sugar. Further, the patent advocates shock cooling i.e. reducing temperatures from 1 OOoC to 20oC say in 2 seconds.<br>
US Patent No. 6,462,003 relates to preparation of transparent soap through saponification of fatty acid or animal/vegetable oil with alkali.<br>
As seen above the state of the art of technology is different for different types of soaps (opaque, translucent and transparent), manufacturer requires to setup different setups for manufacturing opaque/translucent and transparent soaps, which requires huge capital investments.<br>
Further, the most of the existing processes for casting soaps are batch processes. Individual batches of hot liquid soap with a given formulation are prepared and put in moulds for casting/solidification. The process of putting the soap into the individual moulds may either through a pump or manual.<br>
The moulds are then force cooled either by chilled water circulation around them or through ambient cooling (allowing them to kept in refrigerated room/ambient conditions for a long time till the soap in the moulds solidifies). Here the individual mould may be large cuboidal (say 25 kgs), large cylindrical (say 25 kgs) or for individual tablets. In the case of the large cuboidal moulds and the large cylindrical moulds, the moulds are cut further manually or through a cutting machine into as marketed size say 75 gms, 100 gms and as per the requirement of the market.The cut pieces are then further weathered for a period of one day in a chamber stamped for branding and subsequently packed. The additional period of one day of weathering is necessary as the surface of solidified soap exposed after cutting large moulds need hardness for subsequent processing viz stamping, packing etc The total process time for getting one tablet by the batch process can vary from anything between 2 days to 7 clays depending upon the formulation used for the preparation of the product.<br>
Hence there is a need for a continuous process for manufacturing of soaps supported by instrumentation and automated control systems. Moreover, continuous processes are preferred today because of their flexibility, speed and economics and are common for producing opaque and translucent soaps. However, the available continuous processes teach the improvement in the mechanism of saponification or improvement in composition. These processes also relate to transparent soaps only due to problems associated with such soaps.<br>
It is imperative to develop a manufacturing process that is scalable and flexible enough to accommodate the processes for opaque, translucent and transparent soaps, that allows for continuous production at a much higher rate, allows user friendly shapes and at the same time does not compromise on the essential properties resident in all soaps made from the casting route e.g. in use feel, grit and transparency. The process should eliminate the need for further processing such as weathering. Such a process would benefit the manufacturer by reducing cost and time thereby results in reducing the price at the consumer end.<br>

The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>

apparatus where the basic ingredients that go into the making of soap are mixed with the help of a means exemplified by homogenizer (Ab) and a scrapper (Aa) to scrape the material sticking to the walls of the crutcher and ensure that the scraped material mixes with the bulk. The basic ingredients are mixed as the crutcher is indirectly heated preferably using the hot water supplied by the boiler (B) to the space in the jacket between the outer and inner layers of the crutcher. The boiler also provides hot water and/or steam to the jacket of the accumulator (F) and keeps the soap mixture warm/hot prior to dosing. The boiler (B) is in turn supplied with water by the water collection tank (C), which is manually filled with water initially. The water collection tank also collects water from the accumulator (F) and the crutcher (A).<br>
The temperature of the boiler (B) can be configured using the central electronic controller (X) and electronic controller controls the temperature of the boiler (B). The temperature can vary depending on the type of composition to be used. Preferably it is maintained between 70 - 85 deg C in the boiler, between 60 - 75 deg C in the crutcher, and between 65 - 70 deg C in the accumulator for various kinds of soaps and the setup allows a range<br>
of operating temperatures to accommodate deviations in the temperatures for soap manufacturing process.<br>
Once the ingredients are mixed thoroughly to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the homogenized blend is transferred to the accumulator (F) in any known manner preferably using the transfer pump (D) between the crutcher and the accumulator (F). The accumulator (F) also continuously stirs the mixture using the means (Fa). The accumulator (F) releases the soap mixture through the plurality of openings such as solenoid valves (E). The amount of mixture released is configured using the electronic controller (X) and the controller (X) controls the release of the mixture by the accumulator (F).<br>
The conveyorage details are toomany. Can be condensed to not reveal as much yet convey the essence of the design of the invention.<br>
The cooling of soap takes place on number of conveyers. Soaps in the moulds are moving away from the accumulator (F) on a primary conveyer (H). At the end of the primary conveyer (H) is a secondary conveyer (K) that runs at right angle to the primary conveyer (H). At the end of secondary conveyer (K) is another secondary conveyer (L) again at right angle to the secondary conveyer (K). At the end of secondary conveyer (L) is another secondary conveyer (M) at right angle again. At the end of the secondary conveyer (M) is yet another secondary conveyer (N) again at right angle to the secondary conveyer (M). At the end of secondary conveyer (N) is the exit (O) to carry the cooled soaps.<br>
The primary conveyer (H), secondary conveyer (L) and the secondary conveyer (N) are covered by the cooling tunnel (I) which is supplied with cool air using a plurality of cooling ducts (Y) spread evenly across the cooling tunnel (I). The primary conveyer (H) is fixed with a plurality of moulds (G) exemplified by but not limited to silicone rubber molds each with a plurality of individual soap bar molds. The number of valves/openings (solenoid) is equal to the number of individual soap bar molds on each of the (G).<br>
The soap mixture released by the accumulator (F) falls into the mold (G). The position of the mold (G) is controlled by a sensor (S), which senses the metal foil on the sides of the rubber molds and stops the primary conveyer (H). Once the soap mixture fills the rubber mold (G), the conveyer is actuated again by the central electronic controller (X) to move until the sensor senses the next mold (G) and stops the primary conveyer (H).<br>
The molds (G) on the primary conveyer (H) move at a rate configured at the central electronic controller (X). Once the filled mold (G) reaches the end of the primary conveyer (H) the mold stretches and releases the cooled soap on to the secondary conveyer (K) as the mold moves on to the reverse direction. The soap bars thus released on to the secondary conveyer move through all the connected conveyers L, M and N and finally exiting through the exit (O). In the process, the soap bars pass through the cooling tunnel (I) thrice before exiting. By the time the soap bars exit, the bars are sufficiently cooled. Normally the temperature inside the cooling tunnel (I) is in the range of 15 - 19 deg C, which is sufficient to cool the bars completely. Further, the effective air velocity for convective cooling used in the current design varies between for effective air cooling 1.0 m/s to 4 m/s. However, velocity of 2 meters/sec is advisable. Moreover, flexibility in the machine to vary the air velocity for varying the same for difficult to cool formulations is also possible. When the bars are transferred from one conveyer to other the exposing side gets changed thereby ensuring uniform cooling and maintaining homogeneity. Complete co-ordination in mixing, releasing mixtures and the speed at which the conveyer runs avoids insufficient or excess cooling conditions.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments and the examples, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention.

boiler (B) through double jacketed space and associated with a central electronic<br>
temperature controller (X) to control the temperature, having the entire ingredients<br>
mixed thoroughly, the homogenised blend is transferred into the accumulator (F) using<br>
the transfer pump (D) placed between the crutcher and the accumulator (F) for further<br>
mixing the ingredients therein with the help of stirring means (Fa) at a speed less than 25<br>
rpm to have minimum foam and keeping the mixture hot with the help of hot water<br>
supplied by the boiler to accumulator also, accumulator (F) releases a predetermined<br>
quantity of the soap mixture sensed by the solenoid valve (E) and controlled by the<br>
controller(X) through the plurality of openings into the mould (G) duly impregnated by<br>
metal wire for better heat conduction , passing the moulds for cooling through cooling<br>
tunnel (I) on  number of conveyors being primary conveyor (H),secondary conveyors<br>
(K) ,(L), (M) and (N) arranged in sequence at an angle of 90 degree to each other to<br>
obtain thorough cooled soap through the exit (O)<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the ingredients used for mixing are selected<br>
from the following: Fatty acids &amp; oils - 40-60%, Alkali - upto 10-30%, Solvents/Humectants-15-<br>
30%,  Surfactants-0-10%,  Opacifying  agents-1-10%,  Preservatives-0-3%  in  a  manner and<br>
proportion such as herein described,<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the cooling of soap is effected thrice by<br>
positioning the conveyors at right angle to enable the soap to pass through the cooling<br>
chambers to cool the innermost core of the soap to avoid any form of damage through<br>
mechanical wear while handling.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the weathering time is reduced /eliminated<br>
since the composition does not contain any volatile alcohol thereby reducing the time for<br>
evaporation.<br>
10.	A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the temperature inside the cooling tunnel is<br>
in the range of 5- 20 deg C.<br>
11.	A process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the relation among resident time, air<br>
velocity and temperature drop is 30min, 600 cfm and 25 deg C respectively; 30min, 1200<br>
cfm, and 32 deg C respectively and30min, 1800 cfm and 52 deg C respectively.<br><br>
12.	A process as claimed in claim-  wherein the method of cooling is selected from<br>
brine based chilling, chilled water cooling or liquid nitrogen cooling.<br>
13.	A process as claimed in claim- wherein the temperature of the crutcher by<br>
indirect heating is kept within the range   from 40 to 90 deg C preferably from 45 to 85<br>
degC.<br>
14.	An apparatus as claimed in preceding claims and substantially as herein described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
15    A continuous process as claimed in preceding claims and substantially described in the specification.<br><br></td>
