Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same elements are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the drawings. In the following description, detailed descriptions of known functions and configurations incorporated herein have been omitted for conciseness and clarity.<br>
FIG. I is a perspective view of an external appearance of an electronic device for inputting a user command 3-dimensionally according to an embodiment of the present invention. 4s shown in FIG. 1. the electronic device includes a main LCD 110, a manipulation button 120, and a 3-dimensional touch pad 130.<br>
The main LCD 110 is a display displaying contents such as images and texts and a 3-dimensioital GUI.<br>
The 3-dimensinal GUI is a GUI 3-dimensionally displayed and varying on a<br>
3-dimensional space. In detail, the 3-dimensional GUI means a GLI through which a 3-dimensional GUI picture or content displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture moves along an X-axis, a Y-axis, a Z-axis or a combination axis of the X-axis, the Y-axis and the Z-axis or vary it with its movement along the X-axis, the Y-axis, the Z-axis or the combiantion axis. The content displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture may be an icon, a menu, a list, a pointer (cursor), an image, and so on. Also, the variation with the movement of the contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture includes variations in sizes of the contents and variations in the contents.<br>
The manipulation button 120 is a PUI through which a user can input a user command through a touch. The manipulation button 120 is mainly used to select or execute an item indicated by a pointer (cursor) displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI.<br>
The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is a PUI through which the user can 3-dimensionally input a user command with reference to the 3-dimensional GUI displayed on the main LCD 110. In other words, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is used to 3-dimensionally input the user command to 3-dimensionally vary the 3-dimensional GUI on the 3-dimensional space. In detail, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is used to input the user command to move the 3-dimentional GUI picture or the contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture along the X-axis, the Y-axis, the Z-axis or the combination axis of the X-axis, the Y-axis and the Z-axis or vary it with its movement of the X-axis, the Y-axis, the Z-axis, or the combination axis.<br>
A shape of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will now be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 2A Illustrates only the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 shown in FIG. 1, and FIG. 2B is a cross-sectionaJ view taken along line A-A1 of FIG. 2A. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, an external portion of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is higher than an internal portion of the 3-dimensionla touch pad 130. In other words, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 has a slope descending at a predetermined angle d from the external portion toward the internal portion.<br>
The predetermined angle d of the descending slope of the 3-dimensionla touch pad 130 may be arbitrarily determined in consideration of a thickness of an electronic device to be! realized. In other words, if the electronic device is allowed to be thickened, the predetermined angle d of the descending slope may be great If the electronic device is to be thinned, the predetermined angle d of the descending slope may be. small. If the electronic device is to be very thinly manufactured, the pre-determined single d of the descending slope may be "0o" i.e., the 3-dimensionla touch pad 130 may be flatly realized.<br>
In other words, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be realized in a concave shape as shown in FIG. 3A or may be realized in a flat shape as shown in FIG. 3B.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 3C, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may have a flat<br>
shape when an electronic device is powered oft but may be modified into a concave shape when the electronic device is powered on,<br>
The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be modified from a flat shape into a concave shape only When a user command can or i.s needed to be 3-dimensionally input. In this case, a user may intuitively perceive that the user command can or is needed to be 3-dimensioijally input.<br>
Although not shown in FIGS. 3A through 3C, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be realized in a con vex shape.<br>
A method of 3-dimensionally inputting a user command from a user through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will now be described. 3-dimensionally inputting the user command means that the user 3-dimensionally rubs the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 to input the user command.<br>
In detail.the user may rub the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 along three different axes, i.e., among an X-axis, a Y-axis, or a Z-axis as shown in FIG. 2A. As shown in FIG. 2A, the Z-axis is not orthogonal to the X-axis and the Y-axis and thus may not be regarded as a Z-axis coinciding with a mathematical meaning but is referred to as a Z-axis for convenience in the present embodiment.<br>
Rubbing on the X-axis includes rubbings in left and right directions on the 3-dimensional  touch pad 130. The rubbing in the left direction denotes rubbing in a left direction in an upper or lower area of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4A. Heireinafter, the rubbing in the left direction will be referred to as left-rubbing for convenience.<br>
The rubbing in the right direction denotes tubbing in a right direction in the upper or lower are a  on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4A. Hereinafter, the rubbing in the right direction will be referred to as right-rubbing for convenience.<br>
Left-rubbing and/or right-rubbings are performed to input a user command to move a 3-dimensinal GUI picture or contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture to the left and/or right (on an X-axis) or vary it or them with its movement or their movements |o the left and/or light.<br>
Rubbing on the Y-axis includes rubbings in up and down directions on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. The rubbing in the up direction denotes rubbing in an up direction in a  left or right area on the 3-dimensinal touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4B. Hereinafter, the rubbing in the up direction will be referred to as up-rubbing for conveniences,<br>
The rubbing in the down direction denotes rubbing in a down direction in the left or right area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4B. Hereinafter, the nibbing in the down direction will be referred to as down-rubbing for convenience.<br>
Up-rubbing and/or down-rubbings are performed to input a user command to move<br>
a 3-dimensinal GUI picture or contents displayed on the .3-dimensional GUI picture up and/or down (on a Y-axis) or vary it or them with its movement or their movements up and/or down.<br>
Rubbing ion the Z-axis includes rubbings inward and outward directions on the 3-dimensional touch pad <br>
The rubbing in the inward direction denotes rubbing in an inward direction on the 3-dimensionial touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4C. Hereinafter, the rubbing in the inward direction will be referred to as in-rubbing.<br>
The rubbing in the outward direction denotes rubbing in an outward direction on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 4C. Hereinafter, the rubbing in the outward direction will be referred to as out-rubbing.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4C, positions of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which in-rubbing and out-rubbing can be input are not limited. In other words, in-rubbing and out-rubbing (may be input in any position of the 3-dimensional touch pad 1.30.<br>
In other words, the in-rubbing and the out-nibbing may be input in the upper and lower areas on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which left-rubbing and right-rubbing are input or in the left and right areas on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which up-rupbing and down-rubbing are input. Although rubbings are input to an identical area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130, the rubbings are input in different directions. Thus, the inputting of the rubbings in the identical area does not matter.<br>
In addition, the in-rubbing and the out-rubbing may be input in a left upper area in which the left and right areas intersect, a left lower area in which the left and lower areas intersett, a right upper area in which the right and upper areas intersect, or a right lower area in which the right and lower areas intersect.<br>
As described above, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 has the concave shape in which the external portion is higher than the internal portion. Thus, in-rubbing from an outward direction toward an inward direction may be regarded as rubbing from a high point toward a lower point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. Also, out-rubbing from an inward direction toward an outward direction may be regarded as rubbing from the lower point toward the high point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130.<br>
Thus, when in-nibbing is input, a user feels a finger going inward or downward. When out-rubbing is input, the user feels the finger going outward or upward.<br>
In-rubbing and/or out-rubbing are performed to input a user command to move a 3-dimensina| GUI picture or contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture inward and/or outward (on a Z-axis) or vary it or them with its movement or their movements inward and/or outward.<br>
In detail, the in-rubbing is performed to input a user command for moving a menu indicated by a pointer (cursor) toward a lower menu of items, moving toward detailed<br>
information as to a list item of items of a list indicated by the pointer (cursor), zooming a displayed) image and moving a window on a highest layer toward a lowest layer in a case of a disposition of a plurality of windows performing different tasks in a multilayer  structure.<br>
Also, a user command that may be input through out-rubbing is symmetric to a user command that may be input through in-rubbing. In other words, out-rubbing is performed to input a user command for moving from a lower menu toward an upper menu, moving from detailed information toward a list, zooming out a displayed image and moving a second highest layer to a highest layer in a case of a disposition of a plurality of windows performing different tasks in a multilayer structure.<br>
As showin in FIG. 4B. up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing may input in two areas, i.e., the left and right areas on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. Thus, a user may selectively use an area in which up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing can be conveniently input. In ot|er words, a left-handed user may input up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing through the left area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130, while a right-handed user may input up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing through the right area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. As a result, convenience of a user may be increased.<br>
Types of rubbings that may be input through areas on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 are not flxed but may vary. In detail, an area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which left-rubbing and/or right-rubbing may be input may be interchanged with an area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing may be input.<br>
In more detail a case where a rubbing inputting area is changed with a use direction of an electronic device may be suggested. In other words, in a case where an electronic device is used in a lengthwise direction as shown in FIG. 5A, an area indicated by a bidirectional arrow is an area in which up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing may be input. In a case where the electronic device is used in a widthwise direction as shown in FIG. 5B. an area Indicated by a bi-directional arrow is an area in which up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing may be input.<br>
Accordingly, an area of the 3-dimentional touch pad 130 in which up-rubbing and/ or down-rubbing can be input varies with a user direction of an electronic device. As a result, the convenience of a user can be increased.<br>
In other Words, although rubbings are input in an identical area, types of the rubbings may be different according to use directions of an electronic device. Here, the use directions of the electronic device may be directions along which an image is displayed of the main LCD 110.<br>
The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as a kind of PUI for 3-dimensionally inputting a user command has been described in detail. The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be<br>
understood as an input member sensing a 3-dimensional interface as a 3-dimensional input manipulation of a user. The 3-dimensiona! touch pad 130 may also be understood as an input mamber sensing interlaces on three axes input by a user. In addition, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may also be understood as an input member sensing interlaces in three directions input by a user.<br>
Even in a case where the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is realized in a flat shape, the user may input the interfaces in the three directions and the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may sense the interfaces.<br>
The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits light besides 3-dimensionaly receiving a user command. Light emitting of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will now be described in detail.<br>
The 3-dimension la touch pad 130 may use such a light emitting function to display a rubbing guide in an area (hereinafter referred to as a rubbing-possible area) on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in which rubbing may be input, in relation to a 3-dimensionjal GUI currently displayed on the main LCD 100,<br>
A rubbing guide is information indicating a type of rubbing that may be input in a rubbing-possible area displaying the rubbing guide. Thus, a user can check a rubbing-possible area and a type of rubbing that may be input in the rubbing-possible area through a rubbing guide.<br>
A main LCD 110 of an electronic device shown in FIG. 6A will now be described. A current user V may input only up-nibbing and/or down-rubbing performed to move a pointer (cursor) positioned on a menu item up and/or down. Thus, up and/or down bidirectional arrows are shown as a rubbing guide in a left area on a 3-dimensional touch pad 130.<br>
The up aid/or down bi-directional arrows as the rubbing guide are shown in the left area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 in FIG. 6A but are not limited to this. Thus, up and/or don bi-directional arrows as a rubbing guide may be shown in a right area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 that is another up and/or down-rubbing-possible area,<br>
A main LCD 11.0 of an electronic device shown in FIG. 6B will now be described. A current user U may input up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing for moving a displayed map up and/or down, left-rubbing and/or right-rubbing for moving a displayed map to the left and/Or right, or in-rubbing and/or out-rubbing for zooming in and/or out a displayed map.<br>
Thus, up and/or down bi-directional arrows as a up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing guide are displayed in a left area on a 3-dimensional touch pad 130, left and/or right bidirectional arrows as a left-rubbing and/or right-rubbing guide are displayed in an upper area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130, inward and/or outward bi-directional<br>
arrows a-, an in-rubbing and/or out-rubbing guide are displayed in a right lower area on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6B. nibbing guides may be further displayed in other rubbing-possible areas in which rubbings may be input.<br>
There have been described the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 tor 3-dimensionally inputting a user command through 3-dimensional rubbing, a method of 3-dimensionally rubbing the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 to 3-dimensionaJIy input a user command, and a method of displaying a rubbing guide in a rubbing-possible area using a light emitting function.<br>
The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be touched by a user besides being 3-dimensionally rubbed by the user. This will be described below in detail.<br>
The user may touch a specific point of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 to input a specific user command. In other words, the 3-dimensionla touch pad 130 includes a plurality of points (hereinafter referred to as touchable points) that may be touched to input user commands, and the user commands input through the touches of the user are differently designated in each touchable point.<br>
In an electronic device shown in FIG. 7, a 3-dimensional touch pad 1.30 includes four touchable points. Also, a guide (hereinafter referred to as a user command guide) to a user command input through a touch is visually displayed in each of the touchable points. Thus, a user may perceive the touchable points on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 and types of user commands input through the touchable points. The user command guide may be displayed using various inscribing methods such as printings, depressed engravings, and the like.<br>
In detail, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 of the electronic device shown in FIG. 7 includes a left upper touchable point for inputting a user command "back," a left lower touchable point for inputting a user command " ! ^^," a right upper touchable point for inputting 4 user command "Menu," and a right lower touchable point for inputting a user command "►► |." Also, corresponding user command guides are visually displayed in ife left upper touchable point, the left lower touchable point, the right upper touchable point, and the right lower touchable point.<br>
The user command guides may be displayed around the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 not on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. For example, in the electronic device shown in FIG. 1, a user command guide is displayed at the outer edge of the electronic device positioned outside the 3-dimensional touch pad 1.30. Also, in this case, the user command guidle that may be input through a touchable point is displayed correctly next to the touchable point.<br>
As described above, a user command that may be input through a touch of a touchable point may be relatively frequently used so as to provide convenience to the<br>
user.<br>
A user command guide may be displayed on the main LCD 110 of the electronic-device not on or around the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. In this case, a position of the main LCD I JO in which the user command guide is displayed may visually correspond to a position of a touchable point of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 touched to input a user command.<br>
Also, in this case, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may display a touch guide in the touchable point thereon using a light emitting function. The touch guide is information indicating the touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 through emitting of light. Thus,;a user may perceive a position of the touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 through the touch guide.<br>
In other words, as shown in FIG. 8A, user command guides are displayed on a main LCD 110 and touch guides are displayed in touchable points on a 3-dimensional touch pad 130. Positions of the user command guides on the main LCD 110 visually correspond to positions of the touchable points of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 touched to input the user commands.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, a position of a user command "menu" displayed on the main LCD 110 visually corresponds to a position of a left upper touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 touched to input the user command "menu." Also, a position of a user command "set" displayed on the main LCD 110 visually corresponds to a position of an intermediate upper touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 touched to input the user command "set."<br>
If the upper touchable point is touched by a user U as shown in FIG. 8A, the user command "menu" is input.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, touch guides are displayed at a left upper touchable point, an intermediate touchable point, a right upper touchable point, a left intermediate touchable point, a right intermediate touchable point, and a left lower touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 respectively touched to input user commands "Mp3," "Movie" "Photo,""Text,""Dic.," and "Game."<br>
Also, positions of touchable points on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 visually correspond to positions of user command guides to user commands displayed on the main LCD 110, the user command guides being input by touching the touchable points. If the left lower touchable point is touched by a user U as shown in FIG, 8B, the user command "Game" is input.<br>
The positions of the user command guides on the main LCD 110 may visually correspond to the positions of the touchable points on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130, the touchable points being touched to input the user commands, and colors of the user command guides are equal to those of touch guides so as to help a user with the<br>
easy perception.<br>
It has been described that the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 has a square ring shape. However, the 3 dimensional touch pad 130 may not have the square ring shape but may have any shape. The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may have a square ring shape as shown in FIG. 9A, a ring shape shown in FIG. 98, or an L shape shown in FIG. 9C<br>
Although not shown in FIGS. 9A through 9C, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may have a circular shape, a square shape, a C shape, or any other shape.<br>
In a case where the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 has an L shape, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be positioned at a corner of an electronic device as shown in FIG. 10. In this Case, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be realized so a,s to form a slope descending from the electronic device toward the outside, i.e., toward directions d1, d2 , and d3.<br>
In a case where the 3-dimensionla touch pad 130 has the square ring shape as shown in FlG. 1 or a ring shape, the manipulation button 120 may be provided inside the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. A user may press the manipulation button 120 to input a specific user command.<br>
The manipulation button 120 may be well found and easily manipulated by the user and thus realized to input frequently used user commands.<br>
Also, the manipulation button 120 is positioned inside the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 and this may be used to input user commands related to user commands input through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. For example, the 3-dimension touch pad 130 is used to input a user command to move a pointer (cursor) on a menu or a list displayed on a 3-dimensional GUI displayed on the main LCD 110. Thus, the manipulation button 120 is used to input a user command to select or execute menu and/or list items of items of a menu and/or a list indicated by the pointer (cursor).<br>
One manipulation button 120 may be provided as shown in FIG. 11A, and a plurality of manipulation buttons 120-1, 120-2, 120-3, 120-4, and 120-5 may be provided as shown in FIG. 11B. In other words, a number of manipulation buttons positioned inside the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 is not limited but may vary.<br>
Not the manipulation button 120 but an auxiliary LCD 140 may be provided inside the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 12. In this case, user command guides may be displayed on the auxiliary LCD 140 as shown in FIG. 13. However, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may have a ring shape not a square ring shape as shown in FIG. 13 and include an auxiliary LCD 140 having a circular shape.<br>
Thus, a user U may input a desired user command through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 with reference to a user command guide displayed on the auxiliary LCD 140. In detail, the user U may touch a touchable point positioned around (rightly next to) the user command guide displayed on the auxiliary LCD 140 to input the user command.<br>
Here a touch guide may be displayed at the touchable point on the 3-dimensional touch pad ! 30 through emitting of light as shown in FIG. 13. In addition, the user command guide displayed on the auxiliary LCD 140 may have the same color as the touch guide sit) as to help the user U with the easy perception.<br>
If the user touches a touchable point positioned in a right upper portion on the 3-dimensional touch pad 1.30 as shown in FIG. 13, a user command "M" is input.<br>
Also, a rubbing guide as described above may be displayed on the auxiliary LCD 140.<br>
The auxiliary LCD 140 provided inside the 3-dimenskma touch pad 130 may be a touchable LCD not a LCD for a display. If the auxiliary LCD 140 is the touchable LCD, a user Command may be input using only the auxiliary LCD 140 excluding the 3-dimensioal touch pad 130.<br>
Both the manipulation button 120 and the auxiliary LCD 140 may be provided inside the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. The 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may be void. This may be selectively determined depending on the necessity of a manipulation of an electronic device.<br>
Based on the above-described contents, electronic devices selectively including main LCDs 110, manipulation buttons 120. 3-dimensional touch pads 130, and auxiliary LCDs  140 and disposed using various methods are shown in FIG. 14.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, parts marked with a dark color correspond to the 3-dimensional touch pads 130, and parts marked with LCDs outside the 3-dimensional touch pads 130 correspond to the main LCDs 110. Also, parts marked with a light color inside the 3-dimensional touch pads 130 correspond to the manipulation buttons 120, pails marked with LCDs inside the 3-dimensional touch pads 130 correspond to auxiliary LCDs 140 for displays, and parts marked with a dark color inside the 3-dimensional touch pads 130 correspond to touchable auxiliary LCDs 140.<br>
The electronic devices shown in FIG, 14 are only examples of electronic devices that may be realized based on the above-described contents. Thus, electronic devices having different shapes from the electronic devices shown in FIG. 14 may be suggested.<br>
Such electronic devices will now be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 15 through 19.<br>
FIG. 15 is a view illustrating an MF3 player suitable to be used in a lengthwise direction, FIGS. 16A and 16B are views illustrating MP3 players suitable to be used in a widthwise direction. FIG. 17 is a view illustrating a DMB player, FIG. 18 is a view illustrating a digital camera, and FIGS. 19A and I9B are views illustrating remote controls.<br>
Manipulation announcement light emitting and state announcement light emitting<br>
may be performed using the light emitting function ot the 3-dimensional loud pad 130. The manipulation announcement light emitting is a light emitting operation for visually announcing that a user rubs or touches the 3-dimensional touch pad 13U, and the state announcement light emitting is a light emitting operation for announcing a current operation stale of an electronic device.<br>
Thus, the user may immediately perceive the manipulations input through the 3-dimemsional touch pad 130 and the current operation state of the electronic device and be provided with a high visual effect.<br>
The manipulation announcement light emitting will now be described with detailed examples.<br>
Manipulation announcement light emitting for a rubbing input manipulation of a user through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will be taken as an example. For example, in a ease where a user U inputs left-rubbing through a 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in FIG. 20, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits light so that the light seems like moving along a direction of the left-rubbing input by the user II<br>
Manipulation announcement light emitting for a touch input manipulation of a user through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will be taken as an example. For example, in a case where a user touches touchable points of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in F|G. 21 A, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 lightly emits light at the touchable points touched by the user and the surroundings.<br>
Manipulation announcement light emitting for a push (strong touch) input manipulation of a user through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will be taken as an example. For example, in a case where the user pushes a touchable point as shown in FIG. 21B, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits deep light at the touchable point pushed by the user and the surrounding. This corresponds to manipulation an-nouncement light emitting using a method of varying a light emission degree with the strength of a touch.<br>
Manipulation announcement light emitting for in-rubbing and/or out-rubbing input manipulations of a user through the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 will be taken as an example. For example, in a case where the user performs in-rubbing on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in the left part of FIG. 21C, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits light gradually deeply from the outside toward the inside so as to express an effect of going inwajxl or an effect of going downward. This corresponds to a case where manipulation announcement: light emitting for in-nibbing and/or out-rubbing input manipulations is provided to a user through variations in the brightness of emitted Iight.<br>
In a case where the user performs out-rubbing on the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 as shown in the right part of FIG. 21C, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits light<br>
gradually deeply from the inside toward the outside so as top express an effect of going<br>
outward or an effect of going upward.<br>
The manipulation announcement light emitting may be performed by the auxiliary LCD 140 besides the 3-dimensional touch pad 130. In other words, in a case where the user touches a touchable auxiliary LCD 140 as shown in FIG. 21D. the touchable auxiliary LCD 140 emits light at a point touched by the user and the surrounding.<br>
State announcement light emitting will now be described with detailed examples.<br>
Slate announcement light emitting for a conversion from a power-off state of an electronic device into a power-on state will be taken as an example. In this case, the 3-dimensioinal touch pad 130 may randomly vary a light emitting point to emit light.<br>
State announcement light emitting for a conversion into a holding state of the electronic device will be taken as an example. In this case, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 may periodically emit and then extinct (flicker) light at specific light emitting points.<br>
State announcement light emitting for a conversion of the electronic device into a play state will be taken as an example. In this case, the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 emits light so  that the light seems like rotating along a ring shape of the 3-dimensional touch pad 130.<br>
An internal structure of an electronic device will now be described in detail with reference toFIG. 22. FIG. 22 is a block diagram of an electronic device for 3-dimensionally inputting a user command according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22, the electronic device includes a PU1 unit 210, a controller 260, a 3-dimensional GUI unit 270, and a main LCD 280. The PUI unit 210 includes a 3-dimensional touch pad 220 and a manipulation button 250, and the 3-dimensional touch pad 220 includes a 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 and a light emitter 240.<br>
The main LCD 280, the manipulation button 250, and the 3-dimensional touch pad 220 respectively correspond to the main LCD 110, the manipulation button 120, and the 3-dimensional touch pad 130 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 of the 3-dimensional touch pad 220 senses 3-dimensioiial rubbing and a touch of a user and transmits the sensed results to the controller 260 that will be described later.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 includes touch sensors 231 disposed in two rows. Here, the touch sensors 231 are disposed in the two rows in the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 so as to sense in-rubbing and/or out-rubbing. The touch sensors 231 may be disposed in two or more rows.<br>
The light emitter 240 of the 3-dimensional touch pad 220 is positioned under the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230. The light emitter 240 includes a plurality of light<br>
emitting diodes  (LEDS). T he light emitter 240 emits light under the control ot' the controller 260 so as to perform a light emitting function of the 3-dimensional touch pud 220.<br>
The manipulation button 250 senses touches of a user and transmits the sensed results to the controller 260.<br>
The 3-dimensionaI GUI unit 270 generates a 3-dimensional GUI. The main LCD 280 is a display displaying the 3-dimensional GUI generated by the 3-dimensional GUI unit 270.<br>
The controller 260 deciphers a user command with reference to the sensed results of the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 and the sensed results of the manipulation button 250. The controller 260 also controls the 3-dimensional GUI unit 270 to generate the 3-dimensional GUI coinciding with the deciphered user command.<br>
The controller 260 may be understood as controlling contents displayed on the main LCD 280 according to the user command.<br>
The controller 260 also controls a light emitting operation of the light emitter 240 so as to display a rubbing guide and a touch guide. In addition, the controller 260 controls the light emitting operation of the light emitter 240 so as to perform manipulation announcement light emitting and state announcement light emitting.<br>
The controller 260 controls other elements (not shown) of the electronic device to execute the deciphered user command.<br>
Although not shown in FIG. 22, the electronic device according to the present embodiment may further include an auxiliary LCD. In this case, the auxiliary LCD may be an auxiliary LCD for a display or a touchable auxiliary LCD. Contents displayed on the auxiliary LCD are determined by the controller 260. Also, a result of sensing a touch of a user through the touchable auxiliary LCD is transmitted to the controller 260.<br>
A process of 3-dimensionaIly inputting a user command and changing a 3-dimensional GUI according to the input user command in the electronic device shown in FIG. 22 will now be described in detail with reference to FIG. 24. FIG. 24 is a flowchart of a method of changing a 3-dimensional GUI according to a 3-dimensionally input user command according loan embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In operation S310. the 3-dimensional GUI unit 270 generates a 3-dimensional GUI under the control of the controller 260, and the main LCD 280 displays the 3-dimensional GUI.<br>
In operation S320, the light emitter 240 displays a rubbing guide under the control of the controller 260.<br>
In operation S330, the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 senses 3-dimensinal<br>
rubbing of a user and transmits the sensed result u&gt; the controller 260.<br>
In operation S340, the controller 260 deciphers a user command through the sensed result. In operation S350, the light emitter 240 executes manipulation announcement light emitting under the control of the controller 260.<br>
In operation S360, the controller 260 controls the 3-ditnensionaf GUI unit 270 to generate the 1-dimensional GUI coinciding with the deciphered user command so that the 3-dimensional GUI can he displayed on the main LCD 280.<br>
Thereafter, operations S320 through S360 are repeated.<br>
Operation   S360 will now be described with a detailed example.<br>
A user command deciphered by the controller 260 when the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 senses up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing, i.e., a user command that may be input through up-rubbing and/or down-nibbing, will be described with a detailed example.<br>
The up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing are used to input a user command to move a 3-dimensional GU! picture or contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture up and/or down {on a Y-axis) or vary it or them with its movement or their movement up and/or down.<br>
In a case where a GUI picture shown in FIG. 25 is displayed on the main LCD 2HO, up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 are used to input a user command to move a pointer (cursor) displayed on the GUI picture up and/or down (on a Y-axis),<br>
If a user continuously puts a finger on the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 after the up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing, the pointer (cursor) may move at a high speed.<br>
The up-rubbing and/or down-rubbing may be used to input a user command to move the pointer (cursor) displayed on the GUI picture up and/or down (on the Y-axis) and move an item indicated by the moved pointer (cursor) to another position with zooming in the item.<br>
For example, in a case where a GUI picture shown in FIG. 26A is displayed on the main LCD 280, down-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input to a user command to move a pointer (cursor) to a second list item as shown in FlG. 26B and move the second list item to the top with zooming in the second list item indicated by the moved pointer (cursor) as shown in FIG. 26C.<br>
Left-rubbihg and/or right-rubbing are used to input a user command to move a 3-dimensional GUI picture or contents displayed on the 3-dimensional GUI picture to the left and/or right (on an X-axis) or vary it or them with its movement or their movements 14 the left and/or right.<br>
For example, in a case where a GUI picture displaying a list of a folder 2Album shown in FIG. 27A is displayed on the main LCD 280, right-rubbing sensed by the<br>
3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to slowly {sequentially) move a pointer to a GUI picture displaying lists of a folder "3 Album' next to the folder "2 Album" us shown in FIGS. 27B, 27C and 27D.<br>
As another example, in a case where a GUI picture displaying lists sorted according to "Date" shown in FIG. 28A is displayed on the main LCD 280, left-rubbing and/or nghi-rubbing sensed by the 3-dirnensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to move a pointer to a GUI picture displaying lists soiled according to "Artist" as shown in FIG. 28B or a GUI picture displaying lists sorted according to "Album" as shown in FIG. 28C. In this case, the movements to the GUI pictures displaying the lists may be slowly (sequentially) realized.<br>
In-rubbing is used to input a user command for moving a menu indicated by a pointer (cursor) to a lower menu of items, moving to detailed information as to a list item of items of a list indicated by a pointer (cursor), /ooming in a displayed image and moving a window on a highest layer to a lowest layer in a case of a disposition of a plurality of windows performing different tasks in a multilayer structure.<br>
A user command that may be input through out-rubbing is symmetric to a user command that may be input through in-rubbing. In other words, out-rubbing is used to input a user comrnand for moving from a lower menu to an upper menu, moving from detailed information to a list, /.ooming out a displayed image and moving a second highest layer to a highest layer in a case of a disposition of a plurality of windows performing different tasks in a multilayer structure.<br>
For example, in a case where an electronic device plays an MP3 file as shown in FIG. 29A, out-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to move a pointer to a GUI picture displaying lists including items of MP3 files as shown in FIG. 29D.<br>
In a case where the GUI picture displaying the lists including the items of the MP3 files is displaced on the main LCD 280 as shown in FIG, 29D, out-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to move a pointer to a GUI picture displaying items "MP3 Play," "Movie Play." of an upper menu of an MP3 file list as shown in FIG. 29F.<br>
In a case where the GUI picture as shown in FIG. 29F is displayed on the main LCD 280, right-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input la user command to move a pointer (cursor) to the right as shown in FIG. 29B.<br>
In a case where the GUI picture as shown in FIG. 29B is displayed on the main LCD 280, in-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to call a file list "Movie" subordinate to an item "Movie Play" indicated by a pointer (cursor) as shown in FIG. 29E.<br>
In a case where a GUI picture displaying the file list "Movie ' as shown in FIG. 29F is displayed on the main LCD 280, in-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensionai touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to play a file "Movie" indicated by a pointer (cursor) as shown in FIG. 29G.<br>
In a case where the GUI picture as shown in FIG. 29D is displayed on the main LCD 280, down-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to move a pointer (cursor) down as shown in FIG. 29C.<br>
In a case where a GUI picture displaying MP3 file lists is displayed on the main LCD 280 as shown in FIG. 29C, in-rubbing sensed by the 3-dimensional touch sensor unit 230 may be used to input a user command to play a MP3 file indicated by a pointer (cursor) as shown in FIG. 29A.<br>
