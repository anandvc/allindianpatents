Discharge lamp for dielectrically impeded discharges<br>
having an arrangement of support elements<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention outlined in this application relates to<br>
discharge lamps, specifically to those in which<br>
dielectrically impeded discharges burn during<br>
operation. In such discharge lamps, which are<br>
frequently denoted as silent discharge lamps,<br>
discharges are generated in a discharge medium with the<br>
aid of a set of electrodes. Dielectric impediment is<br>
produced by a dielectric layer between at least a part<br>
of the electrode set and the discharge medium, this<br>
part consisting at least of the anodes when the<br>
distribution of the tasks of the electrodes is fixed.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The details relating to silent discharge lamps need not<br>
be set forth here, because they belong to the prior<br>
art. Silent discharge lamps have recently been given<br>
increasing attention because it is possible with the<br>
aid of a special pulsed mode of operation (WO 94/23442)<br>
to achieve relatively high UV efficiencies that permit<br>
economic generation of visible light given the use of<br>
appropriate fluorescent materials. The invention<br>
relates both to UV radiators and to lamps with visible<br>
emission. Of particular interest in this case are flat<br>
discharge lamps<br>
which can be used, for example, for backlighting<br>
displays, monitors and similar devices. Such flat<br>
discharge lamps generally have a plate-like design,<br>
that is to say they have a base plate and a top plate<br>
which define a discharge space between them for the<br>
discharge medium. At least one of the plates must be<br>
designed for light emission, the top plate being<br>
considered here as at least partially transparent. Of<br>
course, the top plate can in this case bear a<br>
fluorescent material which is not itself transparent in<br>
the true sense.<br>
Because of the flat design, problems with mechanical<br>
stability arise in the case of relatively large formats<br>
of the flat discharge lamps. Consequently, it has<br>
become established to use support elements between the<br>
base plate and top plate. These support elements<br>
connect the two plates and thereby shorten the bending<br>
length between the outer edges of the plates on the<br>
paths between the support elements. In the outer<br>
region, the plates are generally connected via a frame<br>
enclosing the discharge space, which is not denoted as<br>
a support element here, although it also connects the<br>
plates and has a supporting function. The number of<br>
support elements is determined by the requirements<br>
placed on the loadability in bending and in<br>
compression, as well as by the format of the lamp, of<br>
course.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is based on the technical problem of<br>
specifying a silent discharge lamp of the type<br>
described at the beginning having an improved<br>
mechanical design.<br>
The invention provides for this purpose: a discharge<br>
lamp having a base plate, a top plate for the light<br>
exit, which is at least partially transparent, a<br>
discharge space between the base plate and the top<br>
plate, for holding a discharge medium, an electrode set<br>
for producing dielectrically impeded, individual<br>
localized discharges in the discharge medium, a<br>
dielectric layer between at least one part of the<br>
electrode set and the discharge medium, and a<br>
multiplicity of support elements which produce a<br>
connection between the base plate and the top plate,<br>
characterized in that, apart from those at the edges of<br>
the discharge space, the individual discharge regions<br>
are surrounded by in each case substantially identical<br>
patterns of support elements.<br>
The invention also relates to a display device with<br>
such a discharge lamp, for example to a flat display<br>
screen, a display or a similar device using LCD<br>
technology.<br>
The essential idea of the invention resides in not, as<br>
in the prior art, using the support elements in as<br>
small a number as at all possible but, on the contrary,<br>
distributing a relatively large number of support<br>
elements over the surface of the flat discharge lamp.<br>
The inventors have verified that, given appropriately<br>
more frequent support, it is possible to use<br>
comparatively thin base plates and top plates such that<br>
it is possible to realize a substantial weight saving<br>
for the overall lamp. The overall weight of the lamp<br>
is, however, of substantial importance for many<br>
applications. Moreover, in the case of relatively light<br>
plates the mounting method and automatic mounting<br>
devices possibly required therefor can be rendered<br>
substantially more simple and less expensive. Lighter<br>
plates are, moreover, associated with lower thermal<br>
capacitances, so that thermal cycles can be traversed<br>
more quickly, thus further simplifying the production.<br>
Moreover, it is of course also possible to achieve<br>
improved stability with a larger number of support<br>
elements.<br>
In this case, the support elements, which can<br>
themselves certainly be multipartite, but are<br>
preferably unipartite, are to be arranged in an<br>
assignment relating to individual<br>
localized discharges in the discharge space. It is<br>
firstly to be stated in this regard that the individual<br>
localized discharge structures have appeared with the<br>
already mentioned pulsed operating method even without<br>
this invention and were able to be permanently located<br>
by creating preferred sites on the electrodes. However,<br>
the invention is not restricted to lamps with such<br>
preferred sites. Rather, it transpires that the<br>
invention itself results in preferred locations between<br>
the support elements for individual discharges, so that<br>
for example conventional structures, for example<br>
nose-like projections on the cathodes, can also be less<br>
strongly pronounced. To the extent that individual<br>
discharge structures can be produced between the<br>
support elements according to the invention<br>
independently of the possible pulsed operating method,<br>
the invention also relates thereto.<br>
To the extent that this application talks of individual<br>
discharges or discharge structures, these statements<br>
relate, strictly speaking, to regions prescribed by the<br>
design of the lamp, in particular of the electrodes and<br>
the supporting projections, in which such individual<br>
discharge structures can burn. Depending on the<br>
operating state of the lamp, however, variously<br>
extended discharge structures are also conceivable in<br>
this case within these regions. Thus, the regions need<br>
not necessarily be filled entirely with a discharge<br>
structure. Above all, the desire can be to influence<br>
the size of the discharge structures in conjunction<br>
with dimming functions of the lamp. The statements in<br>
this application therefore relate to the regions which<br>
can be filled to the greatest extent with discharge<br>
structures. To the extent that electrode structures are<br>
provided for fixing preferred positions of discharges,<br>
there will generally be a 1:1 correspondence with the<br>
discharge regions.<br>
The assignment between supporting projections and<br>
individual discharge regions is to be present in the<br>
invention at least in so far as the individual<br>
discharge regions are respectively surrounded by<br>
identical patterns of directly adjacent supporting<br>
projections. This excludes, of course, discharge<br>
regions in the edge region of the discharge lamp, that<br>
is to say in the vicinity of the frame or the lateral<br>
closure of the discharge vessel. The aim in this case<br>
is to design the pattern of the directly adjacent<br>
supporting projections around a discharge region<br>
together with this discharge region so as already to<br>
homogenize the luminance here as far as possible. The<br>
relatively large number of supporting projections then<br>
does not play a disadvantageous role for the<br>
homogeneity (compare the above explanations on the<br>
overall design of the discharge lamp). Of course,<br>
individual supporting projections can be directly<br>
adjacent to more than one discharge region, and this<br>
will even be the rule. It is also preferred that the<br>
supporting projections for their part are surrounded as<br>
far as possible by the same pattern of directly<br>
adjacent discharge regions in each case.<br>
Moreover, the assignment between support elements and<br>
individual discharge regions is intended in the<br>
invention preferably to be present to such an extent<br>
that it is possible to find a plane through the<br>
discharge space between the base plate and top plate<br>
and a direction in this plane along which the support<br>
elements and the discharge regions alternate. The<br>
alternating row need not be a row alternating directly<br>
one after the other (according to the pattern<br>
ababab...). Also included is a row in which two support<br>
elements or two discharge regions occur regularly one<br>
after another as long as each support element and each<br>
discharge region has at least one discharge region or<br>
at least one support element as its neighbor (that is<br>
to say, for example, abbabbabb....or aabbaabb...).<br>
They need not necessarily be strictly collinear in this<br>
direction of the alternating row, but can also be<br>
distributed in a somewhat zigzag fashion. It is<br>
preferred for a multiplicity of such rows which are<br>
parallel to one another<br>
to exist in this plane. It is also preferred for there<br>
to be in the plane a second direction which is not<br>
situated parallel to the first-named direction and<br>
along which there is likewise an alternating row of<br>
support elements and discharge regions. In this case,<br>
there is preferably both a set of parallel rows in the<br>
first direction and a further set of parallel rows in<br>
the second direction. Consequently, the overall result<br>
is a planar pattern of support elements and discharge<br>
regions of alternating design, for example a chessboard<br>
pattern.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred in the above definition that<br>
the straight line along which the alternating row<br>
results connects the centers of directly adjacent<br>
discharge regions or discharge regions which are at<br>
most situated next but one or the centers of directly<br>
adjacent support elements or support elements situated<br>
next but one.<br>
A further idea of the invention consists in no longer,<br>
as in the prior art, understanding the support elements<br>
as optical disturbances in an overall discharge<br>
structure that is otherwise designed as homogeneously<br>
as possible. Rather, according to the invention the aim<br>
is to regard the support elements in their now<br>
relatively large number as an integral component of the<br>
structure responsible for the final luminance<br>
distribution. Consequently, the overall structure of<br>
the individual discharge regions is optimized together<br>
with the support elements and the optical modifications<br>
effected by them. In this case, as long as they are<br>
surrounded by a sufficiently large number of discharge<br>
regions, regularly occurring shadings can in principle<br>
be compensated just as effectively by diffusers or<br>
other homogenizing measures as was the case<br>
conventionally for the few support elements used.<br>
Moreover, as explained in more detail further below,<br>
the support elements can, however, themselves also be<br>
used for homogenization, for which purpose they<br>
preferably consist of optically transparent material.<br>
The supporting projections<br>
can certainly also be provided with a fluorescent<br>
coating, but they can also (by contrast with the<br>
remainder of the top plate) be entirely or partially<br>
free from fluorescent material, for example be wiped<br>
free subsequently. They can additionally be brightened<br>
up thereby, because the unavoidable extinction of the<br>
fluorescent layer is eliminated. For the above reasons,<br>
the invention provides that the support elements and<br>
the individual discharges, apart from edge effects of<br>
the lamp, in each case have substantially identical<br>
surroundings, that is to say, for example, all the<br>
support points are surrounded by an identical pattern<br>
of directly adjacent discharge regions, or vice versa.<br>
In the case of electrode sets with strip-shaped<br>
electrodes which, apart from local structures<br>
(preferred points for discharge regions), run more or<br>
less rectilinearly, it is preferred that the discharge<br>
regions on a respective side of a specific electrode<br>
strip are separated in each case by support elements,<br>
for example alternate in each case with support<br>
elements, that is to say support elements are provided<br>
in each case between the discharges. A particularly<br>
simple example is chessboard-like overall arrangements<br>
of support elements and discharge structures. The<br>
exemplary embodiments illustrate this, but also show a<br>
counter example.<br>
Overall, consideration is preferably given to<br>
intermediate distances between directly adjacent<br>
support elements which are 30 mm or less. In the case<br>
of typical dimensions of discharge paths and transverse<br>
extents of individual discharge structures, optically<br>
favorable and very stable support element patterns can<br>
be formed in this region.<br>
According to a further point of view of the invention,<br>
the support elements are designed as supporting<br>
projections in the sense of a unipartite component of<br>
the top plate, the outer contour tapering toward the<br>
base plate in at least one cutting plane perpendicular<br>
to the base plate. The invention is thereby delimited<br>
from conventional support elements which, in the<br>
relevant prior art normally had the form of glass balls<br>
separating the plates. The supporting projections,<br>
according to the invention, of the top plate can<br>
already be provided during the production of the top<br>
plate as a moulded element of the top plate, for<br>
example by thermoforming, pressing or another suitable<br>
shaping method. In principle, they can also be<br>
integrally moulded subsequently, although in this case<br>
they are to be designed in one piece with the top plate<br>
when the lamp is actually mounted, so that the previous<br>
substantial outlay for the positioning and fixing of<br>
separate support elements between the plates can be<br>
eliminated. The outlay on mounting would otherwise be<br>
substantial precisely with the large number of<br>
supporting projections according to the invention.<br>
However, by way of example, it can also be sensible for<br>
the purpose of fastening the supporting projections on<br>
the base plate to provide a connecting element - for<br>
example made from solder glass - between the base plate<br>
and the supporting projections.<br>
An integral production with the top plate is, of<br>
course, most favorable in this case. An advantage of<br>
this unipartite design with the top plate by contrast<br>
with being an integral part of the base plate resides<br>
in that the contact between a supporting projection and<br>
a plate unavoidably produces certain shadows in the<br>
luminance distribution which can impair the homogeneity<br>
and must be compensated. According to the inventors'<br>
findings, this compensation is easier the further<br>
removed the contacts causing the shadows are removed<br>
from the light emitting side of the top plate. This<br>
holds, in particular, in the case of the use of<br>
diffusers and other homogenizing elements on the top<br>
side or above the top plate. The greater the distance<br>
from such homogenizing elements, the better the<br>
possibilities of optical resolution of the shadows.<br>
The already mentioned tapering contour of the<br>
supporting projections should occur in at least one<br>
cross-sectional plane, the cross sectional plane<br>
running perpendicular to the base plate. The<br>
perpendicular orientation is to be defined locally in<br>
the case of a non-planar base plate. Because of the<br>
taper, the supporting projection is narrower in the<br>
direction along the plates just above the base plate<br>
than it is further removed from the base plate. This<br>
taper preferably effects the entire height of the<br>
supporting projection. However, not all the existing<br>
supporting projections need necessarily be provided<br>
with the shape explained here.<br>
These supporting projections that are slimmer in the<br>
region of the base plate at first exhibit relatively<br>
small shadow effects. In the case when the individual<br>
localized discharge structures are produced above the<br>
base plate, it is thereby possible also to keep a space<br>
free for the discharge structures by virtue of the fact<br>
that the latter can exist largely without being<br>
influenced by the supporting projections. The discharge<br>
structures can then be moved together with a way that<br>
is favorable for the homogeneity and be arranged with a<br>
high density with the aid of which high luminances can<br>
be generated. Finally, the tapering contour can also<br>
generate favorable optical properties of the top plate,<br>
something which will be described further in more<br>
detail. The favorable optical properties lead in the<br>
way already outlined at the beginning to the fact that<br>
the larger number of supporting projections contributes<br>
to the homogenizing as an integral component of the<br>
lamp design, and need not be understood as disturbance<br>
of a structure homogenized independently of the<br>
supporting projections.<br>
In order to avoid additional shadings and to utilize<br>
possible positive optical effects of the supporting<br>
projections, the latter preferably consist of an<br>
optically transparent material. However, they can in<br>
this case be coated entirely or partially with a<br>
fluorescent material, as is also the case<br>
with the remaining top plate. The supporting<br>
projections and the remainder of the top plate<br>
preferably consist of glass.<br>
The shaping of the supporting projections is preferably<br>
designed such that not only is a cross-sectional plane<br>
with a tapering cross section produced, but, moreover,<br>
there is also no cross-sectional plane in which the<br>
supporting projection widens too substantially in the<br>
direction of the base plate. When expressed in other<br>
words, this means that the outer surface of the<br>
supporting projections faces the discharge space of the<br>
base plate, in any case the important part of the outer<br>
surface. There can also be individual regions of the<br>
outer surface which run perpendicular to the base<br>
plate, but not over an important part of the<br>
circumference of the supporting projections. In this<br>
case, the outer surface extends from the base plate up<br>
to the top plate, and so there is no talk here of a<br>
small part region of the outer surface.<br>
The outer surface of the supporting projection is<br>
intended to form, in relation to a plane that cuts the<br>
supporting projection and runs at least locally<br>
parallel to the base plate between the top plate and<br>
the base plate, an angle of preferably at least 120°,<br>
better at least 130° and, in the most favorable case,<br>
140° or more, this angle being defined in a cutting<br>
plane perpendicular to said plane and in the direction<br>
of the base plate. The angle thus refers, as an obtuse<br>
angle, to an outer surface of the supporting projection<br>
tipped toward the base plate. With such oblique outer<br>
surfaces, space for the discharges can still be created<br>
in the vicinity of the underside of the supporting<br>
projection adjacent to the base plate, on the one hand,<br>
but on the other hand these oblique outer surfaces are<br>
important for possible optical functions of the<br>
supporting projections.<br>
Specifically, when the supporting projections according<br>
to the invention are limited by the obliquely running<br>
outer surfaces described, through refraction of light<br>
impinging from the discharge space, or through<br>
appropriate alignment of the emission characteristics,<br>
of a fluorescent layer from the outer surface, they<br>
ensure an alignment of light into the core region of<br>
the supporting projections. It is thereby possible to<br>
counteract the shadows produced by the contact with the<br>
base plate.<br>
Furthermore, together with a pattern, prescribed by the<br>
electrode structure, of individual discharges it is<br>
possible to undertake an optimization to a luminance<br>
that is as homogenous as possible in an overall design<br>
of the arrangement of supporting projections and of the<br>
discharge structure. In addition to the shading effect<br>
of the contact between the supporting projection and<br>
base plate, it has also specifically to be taken into<br>
account that the individual discharge structures<br>
typically burn not below, but between supporting<br>
projections. Consequently, the maxima of the UV<br>
generation are likewise situated between the supporting<br>
projections. As a result of the effect of optical<br>
deflection, the light can be brought partly from these<br>
regions into the regions of the supporting projections<br>
so as to produce a relatively homogenous luminance on<br>
the top side of the top plate. The aspect of the<br>
invention addressed here is brought out more vividly by<br>
the exemplary embodiments.<br>
As already touched upon, the supporting projections are<br>
to taper in the direction of the base plate. It is<br>
optimal in this case when the supporting projections<br>
are as narrow as possible in the region of the contact<br>
with the base plate, the term "narrow" being measured<br>
in relation to the other dimensions of the supporting<br>
projection. "Narrow" is in this case a path forming a<br>
small fraction, for example less than 1/3, 1/4 or 1/5<br>
of a typical transverse dimension (along the plates) of<br>
the supporting projection, for example half the height<br>
of the discharge space. This narrowness should be<br>
present in this case in at least one direction, but<br>
preferably in two directions in the "local" plane of<br>
the base plate. In other words, it can be a linearly<br>
narrow or approximately punctiform contact surface.<br>
Very generally, even in the case of somewhat larger<br>
bearing surfaces in relation to the base plate, the<br>
supporting projections can run substantially like ribs<br>
along the top plate, or be limited to small regions in<br>
relation to the dimensions of the plates. In the first-<br>
named case, it is the linear contact surfaces that are<br>
the general concern for narrow contact surfaces, while<br>
in the second case it is the approximately punctiform<br>
ones. The rib-like supporting projections can have<br>
specific stabilization functions, for example they can<br>
provide the top plate with an improved motability in<br>
bending in one direction. Furthermore, as will be<br>
explained in still further detail in the exemplary<br>
embodiments, they can also serve to separate specific<br>
regions in the discharge space from one another, in<br>
order to influence the discharge distribution. Thus,<br>
together with the electrode structure they can define<br>
preferred locations for individual discharges and<br>
separate individual discharges from one another along<br>
identical electrodes. On the other hand, the supporting<br>
projections limited locally in two directions in the<br>
plane of the plate offer the possibility of minimized<br>
shading effects, and are generally sufficient for the<br>
support function.<br>
A preferred shape for locally limited supporting<br>
projections can therefore be formed by a cone or by a<br>
pyramid, in the case of which the vertex touches the<br>
base plate (and is in this case possibly somewhat<br>
flattened off or rounded). In principle, any desired<br>
basic shapes come into consideration for the cones and<br>
pyramids, that is to say surfaces limited with any<br>
desired curves, polygonal surfaces or mixtures thereof.<br>
However, it is largely supporting projections without<br>
edges, that is to say cones, that are preferred,<br>
because the edges can lead to certain irregularities in<br>
the light distribution.<br>
As already stated, an attempt is to be made to keep the<br>
contact surfaces between supporting projections and<br>
base plate as small as possible. Limits can exist in<br>
this case that are set by production methods (rounding<br>
in the case of glass shaping) or by the mechanical<br>
point loading of the base plate, so that rather than a<br>
supporting projection actually coming to bear "in a<br>
pointed fashion" against the base plate, there is a<br>
slight rounding or flattening off. As long as this<br>
rounding or flattening off is not of any substantial<br>
consequence in relation to the size dimensions of the<br>
supporting projection, the basic idea of the narrowness<br>
is not thereby impaired.<br>
However, the preferred feature of the invention is to<br>
keep the contact surface between the supporting<br>
projection and the base plate as small as possible by<br>
virtue of the fact that it results only from bearing by<br>
touching. In other words, instances of bonding, solder<br>
glass and the like, which would necessarily enlarge the<br>
contact surface somewhat, are to be dispensed with as<br>
far as possible. For the rest, such additions usually<br>
have the disadvantage that they release gases upon<br>
heating during lamp production so that extensive<br>
pumping operations are required to keep the discharge<br>
medium pure. Production is substantially simplified if,<br>
in accordance with the invention, such substances are<br>
dispensed with. However, it is not excluded in the case<br>
of bearing by touching that the supporting projections<br>
can be pressed slightly into other layers that are<br>
required in any case, for example into reflection<br>
layers or fluorescent layers on the base plate. A<br>
similar statement can hold for a fluorescent coating of<br>
the supporting projections themselves.<br>
This bearing purely by touching between supporting<br>
projections and base plate generally suffices for the<br>
targeted stabilization effect, because mechanical<br>
stresses pressing the plates away from one another do<br>
not occur, as a rule. This holds, in particular, for<br>
the case, which is of most<br>
interest technically in any case, in which the<br>
discharge lamp is operated with a discharge medium at<br>
low pressure. The supporting projections are then<br>
pressed against the base plate by the external<br>
overpressure.<br>
Finally, in the case of this invention preference is<br>
given to such discharge lamps as are designed for<br>
bipolar operation, in the case of which the electrodes<br>
therefore function alternately as anodes and as<br>
cathodes. Owing to a bipolar operation, the discharge<br>
structures, which are inherently generally asymmetric,<br>
are superimposed on one another to form a symmetrical<br>
distribution on average over time, for which reason the<br>
optical homogenization can be further improved.<br>
Description of the Accompaying Drawings<br>
A more concrete description of the invention is given<br>
below with the aid of the exemplary embodiments.<br>
Individual features disclosed in this case can also be<br>
essential to the invention in combinations other than<br>
those represented. Moreover, the individual features in<br>
the present description and that which follows relate<br>
to aspects of the device and of the method of the<br>
invention. In detail:<br>
figure 1 shows a schematic plan view of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention of individual discharges and<br>
supporting projections;<br>
figure 2 shows a cross-sectional illustration of the<br>
arrangement of figure 1, along the line A-A in figure<br>
1;<br>
figure 3 shows a plan view of an electrode set of a<br>
discharge lamp according to the invention, with<br>
symbolized contact points of the supporting projections<br>
with the base plate, specifically according to the<br>
arrangement of figures 1 and 2;<br>
figure 4 shows an illustration, corresponding to figure<br>
1, of a second exemplary embodiment; and<br>
figure 5 shows an illustration, corresponding to<br>
figures 1 and 4, of a third exemplary embodiment.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic plan view of an arrangement<br>
of supporting projections and individual discharge<br>
regions that is like a chessboard. In this case, the<br>
circles denoted by 1 correspond to the circular<br>
shoulder of a supporting projection at the top plate 3<br>
situated above in the cross-sectional view (A-A) in<br>
figure 2, which are represented as an edge in figure 2.<br>
The vertices of the conical supporting projections<br>
which point downward, that is to say toward the base<br>
plate 4, and therefore form the centers of the circles<br>
in figure 1, are denoted by 2.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the top plate 3 is a<br>
thermoformed glass plate. The contour of the top side<br>
of the top plate 3 is therefore shaped largely like the<br>
underside of the top plate 3. However, this is not<br>
absolutely necessary. The top side of the top plate 3<br>
could also be flat (or have different shapes) . In<br>
addition to the points of view of the optical effect of<br>
the shape of the top plate 3, that is to say of the<br>
supporting projections, in particular, it is necessary<br>
in this case chiefly to consider criteria of favorable<br>
manufacturing capability.<br>
Figure 2 shows that the thermoformed conical supporting<br>
projections have lateral surfaces running relatively<br>
flat. In fact, the vertical dimension is illustrated in<br>
an exaggerated way in figure 2, so that the supporting<br>
projections are actually even flatter than they are<br>
portrayed to be. They define with a horizontal line an<br>
angle (to be understood toward the base plate) of<br>
substantially over 120°, for example of over 130° or<br>
even over 140°. The angle between these lateral<br>
surfaces and the base plate is therefore small, that is<br>
to say is below 60°, and preferably even below 50° or<br>
below 40°.<br>
Denoted by 5 in figure 1 are electrode strips in the<br>
case of which there is no difference between anodes and<br>
cathodes, which are therefore all separated by a<br>
dielectric layer from the discharge space formed<br>
between the top plate 3 and the base plate 4. The<br>
discharge space is denoted by 6 in figure 2. The<br>
electrode strips 5 have shapes that run in the form of<br>
zigzags or waves and are composed of rectilinear path<br>
segments. Short path segments of the electrode strips 5<br>
between directly adjacent supporting projections are<br>
inclined relative to the main strip direction and<br>
ensure separation of the discharge regions, which are<br>
denoted by 7 in figures 1 and 2. If these segments were<br>
to be omitted, the discharge regions 7 would just<br>
touch. Between these oblique path segments, the<br>
electrode strips form indistinct saw tooth shapes in<br>
the vicinity of the discharge regions 7 themselves, the<br>
tip of the saw tooth being situated in the middle in<br>
each case. These electrode shapes are important for<br>
locating individual discharges in the region of the<br>
shortest discharge spacings, that is to say between<br>
corresponding projecting tips of the electrode strips<br>
5. An individual discharge of variable extent which can<br>
also be divided into a plurality of discharge<br>
structures in some circumstances, will burn in each<br>
discharge region 7 in the case of this exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrates that both the<br>
supporting projections 1, 2, on the one hand, and the<br>
discharge structures 7, on the other hand, are<br>
surrounded in each case by identical directly adjacent<br>
arrangements (the individual discharges 7 or the<br>
supporting projections 1, 2). Positions arranged only<br>
at the edge of the discharge lamps are excluded<br>
therefrom.<br>
It is to be seen that the line of section A-A<br>
illustrated in figure 1 runs alternately through<br>
supporting projections 1, 2 and discharge structures 7.<br>
The illustration in figure 2 corresponds to this. The<br>
rectangular chessboard-like<br>
arrangement produces here a simple arrangement with a<br>
multiplicity of neighboring directions of these<br>
alternating rows, specifically four horizontal rows and<br>
seven vertical rows in the detail, drawn in figure 1,<br>
of a relatively large lamp structure. It is to be seen<br>
in figure 2 that the individual discharge structures 7<br>
could also reach in the case of other electrode shapes<br>
as far as into the region below the supporting<br>
projections 1, 2 of the top plate 3. This also holds,<br>
in addition, for a section (not illustrated here) along<br>
a vertical line running in figure 1 through the<br>
supporting projection tips 2. The individual discharge<br>
structures 7 are reproduced in figure 1 by shapes that<br>
are almost square. In fact, the individual discharges 7<br>
can assume other shapes.<br>
The electrode strips 5 illustrated here additionally<br>
have a course which, in addition to locally fixing the<br>
individual discharge structures, also exhibits good<br>
properties with reference to the dimming capability of<br>
the discharges, for which purpose reference is made to<br>
the two applications D 198 44 720 and DE 198 45 228.<br>
The dimming function is attended by a modification of<br>
the planar extent of the individual discharge<br>
structures 7, such that the latter can also be<br>
illustrated in a smaller fashion than in figures 1 and<br>
2. It is to be seen, moreover, that the discharge<br>
structures 7, which are arranged between the same<br>
electrode strips 5, are separated from one another by<br>
the supporting projections 1, 2. Because of the<br>
separating function of the supporting projections 1, 2<br>
the zigzag shape of the electrode strips 5 in this<br>
exemplary embodiment is also only comparatively<br>
slightly in evidence, specifically with reference to<br>
the discharge spacing, that is to say the spacing<br>
between the electrode strips 5.<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view, corresponding to figure 1,<br>
of the base plate 4 with the set of electrodes 5.<br>
Illustrated here, however, is a complete discharge lamp<br>
in the case of which there are provided 21 vertical (in<br>
figure 3) and 15 horizontal (in figure 3) lines with<br>
respectively alternating rows of supporting projections<br>
1, 2<br>
and discharge structures 7. The plane of the base plate<br>
4 is illustrated in figure 3, and so the supporting<br>
projections are shown only with their tips 2 in the<br>
approximate form of a point. For the sake of clarity,<br>
the discharge structures 7 are not illustrated, but are<br>
seated during operation of the discharge lamp as<br>
illustrated in figures 1 and 2. Figure 3 also shows<br>
that the electrode strips 5 are respectively<br>
alternately fed to a right-hand collective terminal 10<br>
in figure 3 and a left-hand collective terminal 11 in<br>
figure 3, in order to be connected jointly thereby to<br>
an electronic ballast.<br>
Figure 3 also shows a frame-like structure 8 in the<br>
outer region of the base plate 4. Conventionally, use<br>
has been made here of glass frames separate from the<br>
base and top plates. In this exemplary embodiment,<br>
however, it is provided in a way similar to the design<br>
of the supporting projections 1, 2 that the * frame" 8<br>
is likewise a projection of the top plate 3, not in the<br>
shape of a cone running down to a point, but as a rib.<br>
Here, the contact surface of the frame rib 8 with the<br>
base plate 4 has a certain width, because it is<br>
necessary there to provide a gastight connection<br>
between the top plate 3 and the base plate 4, for<br>
example by means of a solder glass. In addition, there<br>
are no disturbing shadow effects in this region,<br>
because it is in any case the edge at which the<br>
luminance is already decreasing.<br>
Situated outside the frame rib 8 in figure 3 is,<br>
moreover, a line 9 which shows the limit of the frame.<br>
The frame is bent up outside the rib 8. The electrode<br>
terminals (with bus structure) 10 and 11 illustrated<br>
outside, here, could also be accommodated in a<br>
protected fashion below the bent-up part. In addition,<br>
when dimensioning the frame rib 8 the thickness of the<br>
solder glass used for fastening must be taken into<br>
account with reference to the supporting projections,<br>
which only bear against it. The fluorescent coating is<br>
situated on the side of the top plate 3 facing the<br>
discharge space 6, that is to say<br>
on the underside of the top plate 3 in figure 2, and<br>
covers the top plate 3 completely inside the boundary<br>
illustrated in figure 3. The lateral surfaces of the<br>
supporting projections 1, 2 are therefore also covered<br>
with fluorescent material.<br>
Figure 4 shows a variant of figure 1 as a second<br>
exemplary embodiment. In this case, the same reference<br>
numerals are used for corresponding parts. The<br>
difference from the first exemplary embodiment in<br>
figures 1-3 consists in that the supporting projections<br>
have a ribbed nature, that is to say rest along a line.<br>
They are therefore denoted by 12 in this exemplary<br>
embodiment. It is shown by the auxiliary lines 13 that<br>
in this exemplary embodiment the supporting projections<br>
12 bear in a linear fashion on the base plate 4<br>
essentially above the electrode strips 5. The zigzag<br>
shape of the electrode strips 5 serves in this case to<br>
permit the electrode strips to look out alternately to<br>
the two sides below the respective supporting<br>
projection 12. Consequently, discharges 7 can burn<br>
between adjacent electrode strips, specifically<br>
precisely in the region of the electrode strips 5 that<br>
is not covered by the supporting projections.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, adjacent discharge<br>
structures 7 preceding from a specific electrode strip<br>
5 to a specific side are therefore also separated in<br>
each case by supporting projections. This feature<br>
relates, specifically, to the fact that the discharge<br>
structures cannot converge to a single discharge<br>
structure. This is ensured in the present case by<br>
virtue of the fact that the supporting projections 12<br>
cover the electrode strips 5 between such adjacent<br>
individual discharges 7 (twice). By contrast therewith,<br>
the convergence of adjacent individual discharge<br>
structures 7 in the case of the preceding exemplary<br>
embodiment had been achieved by the spatial arrangement<br>
of the supporting projections 1, 2 between the<br>
discharge structures themselves, that is to say between<br>
their centroids.<br>
In addition, this exemplary embodiment differs from the<br>
preceding one in that the supporting projections are of<br>
corrugated design in the cross-sectional profile shown<br>
on the left in figure 4, and in this case come into<br>
contact with the base plate 4 in a somewhat rounded<br>
way. Owing to this rounded form of contact, the<br>
function of the separation between the discharge<br>
regions along the same electrode strip 5 can be better<br>
observed. In addition, in this cross-sectional<br>
illustration the vertical dimension (in the direction<br>
of a perpendicular to the base plate 4) is also<br>
illustrated in an exaggerated way. In fact, the<br>
structures run flatter. However, the minimum angle of<br>
120° already repeatedly mentioned above is not given<br>
over the entire height of the supporting projections in<br>
this exemplary embodiment. The middle region of the<br>
supporting projections actually runs somewhat more<br>
steeply. The upper region and the lower region are,<br>
however, in the preferred angular range.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further exemplary embodiment. The<br>
lines drawn throughout with a stronger stroke represent<br>
electrode strips which are denoted, once again, by 5.<br>
Otherwise than in the first two exemplary embodiments,<br>
in this exemplary embodiment the electrode strips 5<br>
have a shape that is slightly zigzagged, but otherwise<br>
continuously straight. Rather, after a "saw tooth<br>
period" of the electrode strips 5 intermediate segments<br>
are provided that run obliquely backwards. These<br>
intermediate segments are situated in this case in<br>
parallel and below rib-like supporting projections 12<br>
which correspond in addition to those of the second<br>
exemplary embodiment in figure 4. The courses are once<br>
again indicated with the aid of auxiliary lines 13 and<br>
illustrated in the left-hand lower region of figure 5<br>
in a cross-sectional profile along the line C-C. In<br>
this case, as well, the rib-like supporting projections<br>
12 touch the base plate 4 in a somewhat rounded<br>
fashion. As a result, discharges can be effectively<br>
avoided at the pieces of the electrode strips 5 that<br>
are situated in the contact region between the<br>
supporting projection 12 and the<br>
base plate 4. This is particularly important in this<br>
exemplary embodiment, because there occur along the<br>
direction of the supporting projections 12 spaces<br>
between directly adjacent electrode strips 5 that are<br>
shorter than at the points at which the discharge<br>
structures 7 are actually intended to burn.<br>
Consequently, this somewhat rounded (or alternatively<br>
somewhat planar) bearing of the supporting projections<br>
12 on the base plate 4 is favorable in this exemplary<br>
embodiment in order to "block" specific parts of the<br>
electrode strips 5.<br>
The vertical dimension is once again exaggerated in the<br>
sectional illustration. Here, as well, the actual<br>
structures are somewhat flatter. The statements<br>
relating to figure 4 hold for the angles defined by the<br>
supporting projections along their height. However, in<br>
the case of this embodiment the rounded lower regions<br>
of the supporting projections 12 are designed to be yet<br>
a little wider in order to be able to cover the<br>
corresponding segments of the electrode strips 5<br>
effectively.<br>
A field of individual discharges 7 that is very dense<br>
by comparison with the chessboard arrangements of the<br>
first and of the second exemplary embodiments results<br>
from the particular shape of the electrode strips 5. In<br>
the sectional illustration in figure 5, the individual<br>
discharge 7 illustrated is cut at an oblique angle. By<br>
comparison with the sectional illustrations of the<br>
discharges in figures 2 and 4, it is therefore not<br>
raised from the substrate to the same extent. (As a<br>
rule, the invention deals not with surface discharges,<br>
but with discharges that burn in the volume of the<br>
discharge space and form arcs to some degree). In fact,<br>
however, in its middle region the discharge 7 is also<br>
spaced somewhat from the base plate 4, something which<br>
is no longer illustrated in the drawing.<br>
A common feature of all three exemplary embodiments is<br>
that a high degree of plate stability results from the<br>
arrangement of supporting projections that is<br>
exceptionally dense by comparison with conventional<br>
discharge lamps. Consequently, both<br>
the top plate 3 and the base plate 4 are of relatively<br>
thin-walled design. In addition, as illustrated in<br>
figure 3, it is provided in the exemplary embodiments<br>
that no separate frame is used between the base plate 4<br>
and top plate 3. A drastically reduced outlay on<br>
mounting and substantially shortened processing times<br>
result from the unipartite design of the supporting<br>
projections with the base plate 3.<br>
In addition, the supporting projections illustrated in<br>
the exemplary embodiments have shapes that are<br>
essential to the invention in each case. In all the<br>
exemplary embodiments, they extend from the top plate 3<br>
toward the base plate 4 in a tapering way, the taper<br>
taking place in the case of the rib-like supporting<br>
projections from the second and the third exemplary<br>
embodiments transverse to the rib direction, in each<br>
cross-sectional plane perpendicular to the plates in<br>
the case of the conical supporting projections 1, 2<br>
from the first exemplary embodiment. In this case, in<br>
the first exemplary embodiment angles of 40° occur<br>
between the base plate 4 and the lateral surfaces of<br>
the supporting projections, the lateral surface of the<br>
supporting projections continuing to face the base<br>
plate 4 overall. This implies an angle of 140° between<br>
the lateral surface and the plane, already explained<br>
above, that is parallel to the base plate and runs<br>
through the discharge space, this angle of 140° being<br>
defined facing the base plate.<br>
When, as in these exemplary embodiments, the base plate<br>
3 is coated together with the supporting projections 1,<br>
2 and 12 with fluorescent material, the result of this<br>
is that the emission characteristics of the visible<br>
radiation are inclined so as to produce a brightening<br>
of the shadow caused by the contact with the base plate<br>
4. Thus, light is reflected from the surroundings into<br>
the center of the supporting projection. It is also<br>
possible to provide by way of support in this case<br>
optically active structures on the top side or above<br>
the top plate 3.<br>
These optically active structures can be integrated in<br>
the top plate 3 or provided as a separate element.<br>
Even when the top plate 3 is not coated with a<br>
fluorescent material, refraction of light at the<br>
lateral surfaces, obliquely facing the base plate 4, of<br>
the supporting projections 1, 2 and 12 would produce a<br>
similar effect. In this case, the supporting<br>
projections are respectively surrounded by an<br>
arrangement, as uniform as possible, of discharge<br>
structures 7. In the case of the first exemplary<br>
embodiment, this is the case because each supporting<br>
projection 1, 2 picks up light contributions from four<br>
discharge structures 7 distributed uniformly around it<br>
and, apart from the edge of the discharge lamp, the<br>
supporting projections 1, 2 do not differ therein. In<br>
the case of the second exemplary embodiment in figure<br>
4, the supporting projection ribs 12 are supplied with<br>
light contributions stemming from discharge structures<br>
7 on both sides, there being an addition homogenization<br>
owing to the alternating arrangement. The third<br>
exemplary embodiment in figure 5 is further improved to<br>
the extent that in addition to the alternating<br>
arrangement the discharge structures are situated more<br>
densely, thus producing more discharge-free regions.<br>
