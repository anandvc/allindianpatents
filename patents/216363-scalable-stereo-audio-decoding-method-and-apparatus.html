				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to scalable stereo audio decoding method and<br>
apparatus, and more particularly, to a scalable stereo decoding method and apparatus<br>
using bit-sliced arithmetic coding. This application is divided from Indian Patent<br>
Application No. 1098/CAL/98 (hereinafter referred to as "parent application").<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
As can be found from Annexures "A" and "B" hereto, in ----------------------------<br>
----------- a conventional scalable audio encoding/decoding apparatus, scalability of<br>
a 1-channel mono signal was taken into consideration [K. Brandenbrug, et. al.,<br>
"First Ideas on Scalable Audio Coding", 97th AES-Convention, preprint 3924, San<br>
Francisco, 1994] and [K. Brandenburg, et al., "A two- or Three-Stage Bit Rate<br>
Scalable Audio Coding Sustem", 99th AES-Convention, preprint 4132, New York,<br>
1995]. However, MPEG audio standards [MPEG Committee<br>
ISO/IEC/JTCI/SC29/WG11, Information technology - Coding of moving pictures<br>
and associated audio for data storage media to about 1.5 Mbit/s - Part 3: Audio,<br>
ISO/IEC IS 11172-3, 1998] or AC-2/AC-3 methods [Dolby, "Dolby AC-3 Multi-<br>
Channel Audio Coding - Submission to the Grand Alliance Audio-Specialist<br>
Group", Dolby Lab., August, 1993 ] provide a technology for processing stereo and<br>
multi-channel signals as well as mono signals. In practice, most musical signals<br>
are composed of stereo signals. Thus, it is necessary to employ scalable audio<br>
codec adoptable to signals composed of two or more channel bitstreams as in the<br>
Internet or comunications network.<br>
Generally, musical signals are stereo signals. The stereo signals are<br>
provided through a compact disc (CD), a communications network or a broadcast<br>
network, and will be provided under multimedia environments in the future.<br>
However, existing scalable audio codecs have mostly treated mono signals and<br>
have not yet processed stereo signals. To process stereo signals, signal<br>
transmission must be performed such that all signals for one channel are<br>
transmitted and signals for another channel are then transmitted. In this case,<br>
however, since the quantities of bits generated in two channels are not always the<br>
same, the performance of scalable audio codec is considerably lower at a lower<br>
bitrate for the stereo signals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above problems, it is an objective of the invention according to the<br>
parent application to_______________________________________________<br>
provide a scalable stereo digital audio data encoding method and apparatus, and<br>
a recording medium for recording the encoding method. Encoding is performed by<br>
generating bitstreams comprised of several enhancement layers based on a base<br>
layer using a bit-sliced arithmetic coding (BSAC) technique.<br>
The parent application, thus, provides a<br>
scalable stereo audio encoding method for coding audio signals into a layered<br>
datastream having a base layer and at least two enhancement layers, comprising<br>
the steps of: signal-processing input audio signals and quantizing the same for<br>
each predetermined coding band, coding the quantized data corresponding to the<br>
base layer among the quantized data, coding the quantized data corresponding to<br>
the next enhancement layer of the coded base layer and the remaining quantized<br>
data uncoded due to a layer size limit and belonging to the coded layer, and<br>
sequentially performing the layer coding steps for all enhancement layers to form<br>
bitstreams, wherein the base layer coding step, the enhancement layer coding<br>
step and the sequential coding step are performed such that the side information<br>
and quantized data corresponding to a layer to be coded are represented by digits<br>
of a same predetermined number, and then arithmetic-coded using a<br>
predetermined probability model in the order ranging from the Most Significant Bit<br>
(MSB) sequences to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) sequences, bit-sliced left-<br>
channel data and right-channel data being alternately coded in units of<br>
predetermined vectors. The side information includes at least scale factors and<br>
information on a probability model to be used in arithmetic coding. The<br>
predetermined vectors are four-dimensional vectors produced by coupling the four<br>
bit-sliced audio channel data into one vector. The four-dimensional vectors are<br>
divided into two subvectors according to prestates indicating whether non-zero bit-<br>
sliced frequency components are coded or not, to then be coded.<br>
Also, the step of coding the scale factors includes the steps of obtaining the<br>
maximum scale factor, obtaining the difference between the maximum scale factor<br>
and the first scale factors and arithmetic-coding the difference, and obtaining<br>
differences between the immediately previous arithmetic-coded scale factor and<br>
the respective scale factors subsequent to the first scale factor, mapping the<br>
differences into a predetermined value and arithmetic-coding the mapped values.<br>
The step of coding the scale factors includes the steps of obtaining the<br>
maximum scale factor, and obtaining differences between the maximum scale<br>
factor and the respective scale factors and arithmetic-coding the differences.<br>
The header information commonly used for all bands is coded and the side<br>
information and the quantized frequencies necessary for the respective layer are<br>
formed by bit-sliced information to then be coded to have a layered structure.<br>
The quantization is performed by the steps of converting the input audio<br>
signals of a time domain into signals of a frequency domain, coupling the<br>
converted signals as signals of predetermined scale factor bands by<br>
time/frequency mapping and calculating a masking threshold at each scale factor<br>
band, performing temporal-noise shaping for controlling the temporal shape of the<br>
quantization noise within each window for conversion, performing intensity stereo<br>
processing such that only the quantized information of a scale factor band for one<br>
of two channels is coded, and only the scale factor for the other channel is<br>
transmitted, predicting frequency coefficients of the present frame, performing<br>
Mid/Side (M/S) stereo processing for converting a left-channel signal and a right-<br>
channel signal into an additive signal of two signals and a subtractive signal<br>
thereof, and quantizing the signals for each predetermined coding band so that<br>
quantization noise of each band is smaller than the masking threshold.<br>
When the quantized data is composed of sign data and magnitude data, the<br>
steps of coding of the base layer and enhancement layers and forming bitstreams<br>
include the steps of: arithmetic-coding the most significant digit sequences<br>
composed of most significant digits of the magnitude data, coding sign data<br>
corresponding to non-zero data among the coded most significant digit sequences,<br>
coding the most significant digit sequences among uncoded magnitude data of the<br>
digital data, coding uncoded sign data among the sign data corresponding to non-<br>
zero magnitude data among coded digit sequences, and performing the magnitude<br>
coding step and the sign coding step on the respective digits of the digital data,<br>
the respective steps being alternately performed on the left-channel data and the<br>
right-channel data in units of predetermined vectors.<br>
The scalable stereo audio decoding apparatus further includes an M/S<br>
stereo processing portion for performing M/S stereo processing for checking<br>
whether or not M/S stereo processing has been performed in the bitstream<br>
encoding method, and converting a left-channel signal and a right-channel signal<br>
into an additive signal of two signals and a subtractive signal thereof if the M/S<br>
stereo processing has been performed, a predicting portion for checking whether<br>
or not predicting step has been performed in the bitstream encoding method, and<br>
predicting frequency coefficients of the current frame if the checking step has been<br>
performed, an intensity stereo processing portion for checking whether or not<br>
intensity stereo processing has been performed in the bitstream encoding method,<br>
and, if the intensity stereo processing has been performed, then since only the<br>
quantized information of the scale factor band for one channel (the left channel)<br>
two channels is coded, performing the intensity stereo processing for restoring the<br>
quantized information of the other channel (the right channel) into a left channel<br>
value, and a temporal noise shaping (TNS) portion for checking whether or not<br>
temporal noise shaping step has been performed in the bitstream encoding<br>
method, and if the TNS step has been performed, performing temporal-noise<br>
shaping for controlling the temporal shape of the quantization noise within each<br>
window for conversion.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention of the parent application, there is provided a<br>
scalable stereo audio coding apparatus comprising a quantizing portion for signal-<br>
processing input audio signals and quantizing the same for each coding band, a<br>

have a layered structure, by band-limiting for a base layer so as to be scalable,<br>
coding side information corresponding to the base layer, coding the quantized<br>
information sequentially from the most significant bit sequence to the least<br>
significant bit sequence, and from lower frequency components to higher<br>
frequency components, alternately coding left-channel data and right-channel data<br>
in units of predetermined vectors, and coding side information corresponding to<br>
the next enhancement layer of the base layer and the quantized data, and a<br>
bitstream forming portion for collecting data formed in the quantizing portion and<br>
the bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion and generating bitstreams.<br>
The quantizing portion includes a time/frequency mapping portion for<br>
converting the input audio signals of a temporal domain into signals of a frequency<br>
domain, a psychoacoustic portion for coupling the converted signals by signals of<br>
predetermined scale factor bands by time/frequency mapping and calculating a<br>
masking threshold at each scale factor band using a masking phenomenon<br>
generated by interaction of the respective signals, and a quantizing portion for<br>
quantizing the signals for each predetermined coding band while the quantization<br>
noise of each band is compared with the masking threshold.<br>
Also, the apparatus further includes a temporal noise shaping (TNS) portion for<br>
performing temporal-noise shaping for controlling the temporal shape of the<br>
quantization noise within each window for conversion, an intensity stereo<br>
processing portion for performing intensity stereo processing such that only the<br>
quantized information of a scale factor band for one of two channels is coded, and<br>
only the scale factor for the other channel is transmitted, a predicting portion for<br>
predicting frequency coefficients of the present frame, and an M/S stereo<br>
processing portion for performing M/S stereo processing for converting a left-<br>
channel signal and a right-channel signal into an additive signal of two signals and<br>
a subtractive signal thereof.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a scalable stereo audio decoding method for decoding audio data coded to have<br>
layered bitrates, comprising the steps of analyzing data necessary for the respective<br>
modules in the bitstreams having a layered structure, decoding at least scale<br>
factors and arithmetic-coding model indices and quantized data, in the order of<br>
creation of the layers in bitstreams having a layered structure, the quantized data<br>
decoded alternately for the respective channels by analyzing the significance of<br>
bits composing the bitstreams, from upper significant bits to lower significant bits,<br>
restoring the decoded scale factors and quantized data into signals having the<br>
original magnitudes, and converting inversely quantized signals into signals of a<br>
temporal domain.<br>
The scalable stereo audio decoding method further includes the steps of<br>
performing M/S stereo processing for checking whether or not M/S stereo<br>
processing has been performed in the bitstream encoding method, and converting<br>
a left-channel signal and a right-channel signal into an additive signal of two<br>
signals and a subtractive signal thereof if the M/S stereo processing has been<br>
performed, checking whether or not a predicting step has been performed in the<br>
bitstream encoding method, and predicting frequency coefficients of the current<br>
frame if the checking step has been performed, checking whether or not an<br>
intensity stereo processing step has been performed in the bitstream encoding<br>
method, and, if the intensity stereo processing has been performed, then since<br>
only the quantized information of the scale factor band for one channel (the left<br>
channel) two channels is coded, performing the intensity stereo processing for<br>

The decoding step is performed from the most significant bits to the lowest<br>
significant bits and the restoring step is performed by coupling the decoded bit-<br>

The data is decoded in the decoding step such that bit-sliced information of<br>
four samples is decoded into units of four-dimensional vectors.<br>
The four-dimensional vector decoding is performed such that two<br>
subvectors coded according to prestates indicating whether non-zero bit-sliced<br>
frequency components are coded or not is arithmetic-decoded, and the two<br>
subvectors decoded according to the coding states of the respective samples are<br>

Also, while the bit-sliced data of the respective frequency components is<br>
decoded from the MSBs, decoding is skipped if the bit-sliced data is "0" and sign<br>
data is arithmetic-decoded when the bit-sliced data "1" appears for the first time.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinbelow, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The present invention is to encode and decode scalable stereo digital audio<br>
data using a bit-sliced arithmetic coding (BSAC) technique. In other words, in the<br>
present invention, only a lossless coding module is replaced with the BSAC<br>
technique, with all other modules of the conventional coder remaining unchanged.<br>
The present invention extends the adoptability of the thus-constructed scalable<br>
coder/decoder, that is to say, the present invention can be adopted to a stereo<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a scalable audio encoding apparatus according<br>
to the present invention. The scalable audio encoding apparatus includes a<br>
time/frequency mapping portion 100, a psychoacoustic portion 110, a temporal<br>
noise shaping portion 120, an intensity stereo processing portion 130, a predicting<br>
portion 140, a mid/side (M/S) stereo processing portion 150, a quantizing portion<br>
160, a bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion 170, and a bitstream forming portion<br>
180.<br>
The most important human acoustic characteristics in coding a digital audio<br>
signal are a masking effect and a critical band feature. The masking effect refers<br>
to a phenomenon in which an audio signal (sound) is inaudible due to another<br>
signal. For example, when a train passes through a train station, a person cannot<br>
hear his/her counterpart"s voice during a low-voice conversation due to the noise<br>
caused by the train. Audio signals are perceived differently for each band within<br>
the human audible frequency range. Also, in view of the critical band features,<br>
noises having the same amplitude are differently perceived when the noise signal<br>
is in a critical band or when the noise signal is out of a critical signal. In this case,<br>
when the noise signal exceeds the critical band, the noise is more clearly<br>
perceived.<br>
Coding human acoustic characteristics basically utilizes these two<br>
characteristics such that the range of noise which can be allocated within a critical<br>
band is calculated and then quantization noise is generated corresponding to the<br>
calculated range to minimize information loss due to coding.<br>
The time/frequency mapping portion 100 converts input audio signals of a<br>
temporal domain into audio signals of a frequency domain.<br>
The psychoacoustic portion 110 couples the converted signals by the<br>
time/frequency mapping portion 100 by signals of predetermined scale factor<br>
bands and calculates a masking threshold at each scale factor band using a<br>
masking phenomenon generated by interaction with the respective signals.<br>
The temporal domain noise shaping portion 120 controls the temporal<br>
shape of quantization noise within each window for conversion. The noise can be<br>
temporally shaped by filtering frequency data. This module is optionally used in<br>
the encoder.<br>
The intensity stereo processing portion 130 is a module used for more<br>
efficiently processing a stereo signal, and encodes only the quantized information<br>
for the scale factor band of one of two channels with the scale factor band of the<br>
other channel being transmitted. This module is not necessarily used in the<br>
encoder but various matters are taken into consideration for each scale factor<br>
band to determine whether it is to be used or not.<br>
The predicting portion 140 estimates frequency coefficients of the current<br>
frame. The difference between the predicted value and the actual frequency<br>
component is quantized and coded, thereby reducing the quantity of generated<br>
usable bits. The predicting portion 140 is optionally used in units of frames. In<br>
other words, since using the predicting portion 140 increases the complexity<br>
increases in predicting the subsequent frequency coefficient, the predicting portion<br>
140 may not be used. Occasionally, the quantity of actually generated bits by<br>
estimation may be greater than that by non-estimation. At this time, the predicting<br>
portion 140 is not used.<br>
The M/S stereo processing portion 150 for processing stereo signals more<br>
efficiently, converts a left-channel signal and a right-channel signal into additive<br>
and subtractive signals of two signals, respectively, to then process the same.<br>
This module is not necessarily used in the encoder but various matters are taken<br>
into consideration for each scale factor band to determine whether it is to be used<br>
or not.<br>
The quantizing portion 160 scalar-quantizes the frequency signals of each<br>
band so that the magnitude of the quantization noise of each band is smaller than<br>
the masking threshold, so as to be imperceivable. Quantization is performed so<br>
that the NMR (Noise-to-Mask Ratio) value, which is a ratio of the masking<br>
threshold calculated by the psychoacoustic portion 210 to the noise generated at<br>
each band, is less than or equal to 0 dB. A NMR value less than or equal to 0 dB<br>
means that the masking threshold is higher than the quantization noise. In other<br>
words, the quantization noise is not audible.<br>
The bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion 170, a core module of the present<br>
invention, can be used as an alternative to a lossless coding portion of the ACC<br>
technique since the existing audio codec such as MPEG-2 AAC cannot provide<br>
scalability. To implement the scalable audio codec, the frequency data quantized<br>
by the quantizing portion 160 is coded by combining the side information of the<br>
corresponding band and the quantization information of audio data. Also, in<br>
addition to scalability, performances similar to those in AAC can be provided in a<br>
top layer. The functions of the bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion 170 will be<br>
described in more detail. The band is limited to one corresponding to the base<br>
layer so as to be scalable, and the side information for the base layer is coded.<br>
The information for quantized values are sequentially coded in the order ranging<br>
from the MSB sequences to the LSB sequences, and from the lower frequency<br>
components to the higher frequency components. Also, left channels and right<br>
channels are alternately coded in units of predetermined vectors to perform coding<br>
of the base layer. After the coding of the base layer is completed, the side<br>
information for the next enhancement layer and the quantized values of audio data<br>
are coded so that the thus-formed bitstreams have a layered structure.<br>
The bitstream forming portion 180 generates bitstreams according to a<br>
predetermined syntax suitable for the scalable codec by collecting information<br>
formed in the respective modules of the coding apparatus.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the structure of a bitstream according to the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIG. 2, the bitstreams have a layered structure in which<br>
the bitstreams of lower bitrate layers are contained in those of higher bitrate layers<br>
according to bitrates. Conventionally, side information is coded first and then the<br>
remaining information is coded to form bitstreams. However, in the present<br>
invention, as shown in FIG. 2, the side information for each enhancement layer is<br>
separately coded. Also, although all quantized data are sequentially coded in<br>
units of samples conventionally, in the present invention, quantized data is<br>
represented by binary data and is coded from the MSB sequence of the binary<br>
data to form bitstreams within the allocated bits.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a decoding apparatus according to the present<br>
invention, which includes a bitstream analyzing portion 300, a bit-sliced arithmetic<br>
decoding portion 310, an inverse quantizing portion 320, an M/S stereo processing<br>
portion 330, a predicting portion 340, an intensity stereo processing portion 350, a<br>
temporal domain noise shaping portion 360, and a frequency/time mapping portion<br>
370.<br>
The bitstream analyzing portion 300 separates header information and<br>
coded data in the order of generation of the input bitstreams and transmits the<br>
same to the respective modules.<br>
The bit-sliced arithmetic decoding portion 310 decodes side information and<br>
bit-sliced quantized data in the order of generation of the input bitstreams to be<br>
transferred to the inverse quantizing portion 320.<br>
The M/S stereo processing portion 330 adopted only to the stereo signals<br>
processes the scale factor band corresponding to the M/S stereo processing<br>
performed in the coding apparatus.<br>
In the case when estimation is performed in the coding apparatus, the<br>
predicting portion 340 searches the same values as the decoded data in the<br>
previous frame through estimation in the same manner as the coding apparatus.<br>
The predicted signal is added with a difference signal decoded by the bitstream<br>
analyzing portion 300, thereby restoring the original frequency components.<br>
The intensity stereo processing portion 350 adopted only to the stereo<br>
signals processes the scale factor band corresponding to the intensity stereo<br>
processing performed in the coding apparatus.<br>
The temporal domain noise shaping portion 360 employed for controlling<br>
the temporal shape of quantization noise within each window for conversion,<br>
performs corresponding processing.<br>
The decoded data is restored as a signal of a temporal region by such a<br>
processing module as a conventional audio algorithm such as the AAC standards.<br>
First, the inverse quantizing portion 320 restores the decoded scale factor and<br>
quantized data into signals having the original magnitudes. The frequency/time<br>
mapping portion 370 converts inversely quantized signals into signals of a<br>
temporal domain so as to be reproduced.<br>
Now, the operation of the coding apparatus will be described.<br>
Input audio signals are converted to signals of a frequency domain through<br>
MDCT (Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) in the time/frequency mapping<br>
portion 100. The psychoacoustic portion 110 couples the frequency signals by<br>
appropriate scale factor bands to obtain a masking threshold. Also, the audio<br>
signals converted into signals of a frequency domain pass through modules for<br>
enhancing the coding efficiency, that is, the TNS portion 120, the intensity stereo<br>
processing portion 130, the predicting portion 140 and the M/S stereo processing<br>
portion 150, to then become more efficiently compressed signals.<br>
The quantizing portion 160 performs scalar quantization so that the<br>
magnitude of the quantization noise of each scale factor band is smaller than the<br>
masking threshold, which is audible but is not perceivable within allocated bits. If<br>
quantization fulfilling such conditions is performed, scale factors for the respective<br>
scale factor bands and quantized frequency values are generated.<br>
Generally, in view of human psychoacoustics, close frequency components<br>
can be easily perceived at a lower frequency. However, as the frequency<br>
increases, the interval of perceivable frequencies becomes wider. The bandwidths<br>
of the scale factor bands increase as the frequency bands become higher.<br>
However, to facilitate coding, the scale factor bands of which the bandwidth is not<br>
constant are not used for coding, but coding bands of which the bandwidth is<br>
constant are used instead. The coding bands include 32 quantized frequency<br>
coefficient values.<br>
The conventional coding/decoding apparatus, in which only the coding<br>
efficiency is taken into consideration, such as AAC, first codes the information<br>
commonly used in left and right channels at a place of the header, in processing<br>
stereo signals. The left-channel data is coded and the right-channel data is then<br>
coded. That is, coding is progressed in the order of header, left channel and right<br>
channel.<br>
When the information for the left and right channels are arranged and<br>
transmitted irrespective of significance after the header is processed in such a<br>
manner, if the bitrate is lowered, signals for the right channel positioned backward<br>
disappear first. Thus, the perceivable lowering in the performance becomes<br>
serious.<br>
However, the stereo audio coding apparatus according to the present<br>
invention codes side information for each channel. In other words, the side<br>
information for each channel is coded by the bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion<br>
170 alternately in the order of the left channel and the right channel. The coding<br>
method of scale factors is slightly modified for more efficient compression.<br>
First, coding of scale factors will be described. The stereo audio coding<br>
apparatus according to the present invention codes scale factors using two<br>
methods to be described below for the purpose of enhancing the coding efficiency.<br>
The coding apparatus selects a method exhibiting better performance and<br>
transmits the selected method to the decoding apparatus.<br>
To compress scale factors, first, the maximum scale factor<br>
(max_scalefactor) is obtained from the scale factors. Then, differences between<br>
the respective scale factors and the maximum scale factor are obtained and then<br>
the differences are arithmetic-coded. Four models are used in arithmetic-coding<br>
the differences between scale factors. The four models are demonstrated in<br>
Tables 5.5 through 5.8. The information for the models is stored in a<br>
scalefactor_model.<br><br>
Second, to compress scale factors, the maximum scale factor<br>
(max_scalefactor) is obtained from the scale factors, as in the first method. Then,<br>
the difference between the first scale factors and the maximum scale factor is<br>
obtained and then the difference is arithmetic-coded. Then, differences between<br>
the remaining scale factors and the previous scale factors are obtained and the<br>
differences are arithmetic-coded. In this case, since the used models are<br>
prescribed, the scalefactor_model value is meaningless.<br>
Next, coding of quantized frequency components for a stereo signal will be<br>
described. Quantized data for each channel is bit-sliced. When a mono-channel<br>
signal is processed, bit-sliced data is coupled by four-dimensional vectors and the<br>
four-dimensional vectors are used as a basic unit. This is also true of the coding<br>
of a stereo-channel signal. In other words, coding is started from the MSB. The<br>
four-dimensional vectors of the bit-sliced data are arithmetic-coded from the left<br>
channel. Next, the four-dimensional vectors for the right channel at the same<br>
frequency level are arithmetic-coded. In such a manner, the left channel and the<br>
right channel are interleaved to be coded.<br>
In the case of a single channel, coding is performed from the MSB to the<br>
LSB. The bit-sliced data having the same sinificance are coded from lower<br>
frequency components to higher frequency components. At this time, if the bits<br>
allocated to the respective vectors are more significant than those currently being<br>
coded, it is not necessary to code the pertinent vector and the coding of the same<br>
is skipped.<br>
XQO, XQ1,XQ2.....XQk, ...<br>
where Xqk is bit-sliced data of the quantized frequency components from 4*k to<br>
4*k+3.<br>
In the case of two channels, coding is performed from the MSB to the LSB,<br>
as in the case of a single channel. Similarly, the bit-sliced data having the same<br>
significance are coded from lower frequency components to higher frequency<br>
components. However, considering that there are two channels, the coding<br>
sequence is decided. It is assumed that the quantized frequency components in<br>
the left- and right-channels are as follows:<br>
Left-channel: XQLO, XQL1, XQL2, XQL3, XQL4, XQL5,.....XQLk, ...<br>
Right-channel: XQRO, XQR1, XQR2, XQL3, XQL4, XQL5, ...., XQRk, ...<br>
where XQLk and XQLRk are bit-sliced data of the quantized frequency<br>
components from 4*k to (4*k+3).<br>
In this way, in the case of two channels, the coding is performed from the<br>
lower frequency components to higher frequency components in a similar<br>
sequence to the case of one channel. However, interleaving is performed<br>
between channel components in order to code significant components first. In<br>
other words, the respective vectors are alternately coded between two channels as<br>
follows:<br>
XQL1,XQR1,XQL2, XQR2,...<br>
Since the thus-formed information is sequentially coded in the order of<br>
significance in both channels, even though the bitrate is reduced in a scalable<br>
audio codec, the performance is not considerably lowered.<br>
Now, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
The present invention is adoptable to the base structure of the AAC standards<br>
including all modules such as additional modules for enhancing the coding<br>
efficiency and implements a scalable digital audio data coder. In other words, in<br>
the present invention, while the basic modules used in AAC standard<br>
coding/decoding are used, only the lossless coding module is replaced with the<br>
bit-sliced encoding method to provide a scalable coding apparatus. In the present<br>
invention, information for only one bitrate is not coded within one bitstream but<br>
information for the bitrates of various enhancement layers is coded within a<br>
bitstream, with a layered structure, as shown in FIG. 2, in the order ranging from<br>
more important signal components to less important signal components.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the same modules<br>
as the AAC standards are employed until before the lossless coding of the BSAC<br>
scalable codec. Thus, if the quantized frequency data is formed by decoding the<br>
AAC bitstreams, the decoded data can be restored to the BSAC scalable<br>
bitstreams. This means that lossless transcoding is possible between the AAC<br>
bitstreams and the BSAC scalable bitstreams. Finally, mutual conversion into an<br>
appropriate bitstream format is allowed depending upon environments or<br>
circumstances. Thus, both coding efficiency and scalability can be satisfied and<br>
are complementary to each other, which is distinguished from another scalable<br>
codec.<br>
Using the thus-formed bitstreams, bitstreams having a low bitrate can be<br>
formed by simply rearranging the low bitrate bitstreams contained in the highest<br>
bitstream, by user request or according to the state of transmission channels. In<br>
other words, bitstreams formed by a coding apparatus on a real time basis, or<br>
bitstreams stored in a medium, can be rearranged to be suitable for a desired<br>
bitrate by user request, to then be transmitted. Also, if the user"s hardware<br>
performance is poor or the user wants to reduce the complexity of the decoder,<br>
even with appropriate bitstreams, only some bitstreams can be restored, thereby<br>
controlling the complexity.<br>
For example, in forming a scalable bitstream, the bitrate of a base layer is<br>
16 Kbps, that of a top layer is 64 Kbps, and the respective enhancement layers<br>
has a bitrate interval of 8 Kbps, that is, the bitstream has 7 layers of 16, 24, 32,<br>
40, 48, 56 and 64 Kbps. The respective enhancement layers are defined as<br>
demonstrated in Table 2.1. Since the bitstream formed by the coding apparatus<br>
has a layered structure, as shown in FIG. 3, the bitstream of the top layer of 64<br>
Kbps contains the bitstreams of the respective enhancement layers (16, 24, 32,<br>
40, 48, 56 and 64 Kbps). If a user requests data for the top layer, the bitstream<br>
for the top layer is transmitted without any processing therefor. Also, if another<br>
user requests data for the base layer (corresponding to 16 Kbps), only the leading<br>
bitstreams are simply transmitted.<br><br>
Alternatively, the enhancement layers may be constructed in finer intervals.<br>
The bitrate of a base layer is 16 Kbps, that of a top layer is 64 Kbps, and each<br>
enhancement layer has a bitrate interval of 1 Kbps. The respective enhancement<br>
layers are constructed as demonstrated in Table 3.1. Therefore, fine granule<br>
scalability can be implemented, that is, scalable bitstreams are formed in a bitrate<br>
interval of 1 kbps from 16 kbps to 64 kbps.<br>
The respective layers have limited bandwidths according to bitrates. If 8<br>
kbps interval scalability is intended, the bandwidths are limited, as demonstrated in<br>
Tables 2.2 and 2.3. In the case of a 1-kbps interval, the bandwidths are limited,<br>
as demonstrated in Tables 3.2 and 3.3.<br><br>
Input data is a PCM data sampled at 48 KHz, and the magnitude of one<br>
frame is 1024. The number of bits usable for one frame for a bitrate of 64 Kbps is<br>
1365.3333 (=64000 bits/sec*(1024/48000)) on the average. Similarly, the size of<br>
available bits for one frame can be calculated according to the respective bitrates.<br>
The calculated numbers of available bits for one frame are demonstrated in Table<br>
2.4 in the case of 8 kbps, and in Table 3.4 in the case of 1 kbps.<br><br><br>
Now, the stereo audio signal coding and decoding procedure according to<br>
the present invention will now be described in detail.<br>
1. Coding procedure<br>
The entire coding procedure is the same as that described in MPEG-2 ACC<br>
International standards, and the bit-sliced coding proposed in the present invention<br>
is adopted as lossless coding.<br>
1.1. Psychoacoustic portion<br>
Using a psychoacoustic model, the block type of a frame being currently<br>
processed (long, start, short, or stop), the SMR values of the respective<br>
processing bands, group information of a short block and temporally delayed PCM<br>
data for time/frequency synchronization with the psychoacoustic model, are first<br>
generated from input data, and transmitted to a time/frequency mapping portion.<br>
ISO/IEC 11172-3 Model 2 is employed for calculating the psychoacoustic model<br>
[MPEG Committee ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11, Information technology-Coding of<br>
moving pictures and associated audio for data storage media to about 1.5 Mbit/s-<br>
Part 3: Audio, ISO/OEC IS 11172-3, 1993]. This module must be necessarily used<br>
but different models may be used according to users.<br>
1.2. Time/frequency mapping portion<br>
A time/frequency mapping defined in the MPEG-2 AAC International<br>
standards is used. The time/frequency mapping portion converts data of a<br>
temporal domain into data of a frequency domain using MDCT according to the<br>
block type output using the psychoacoustic model. At this time, the block sizes<br>
are 2048 and 256 in the case of long/start/stop blocks and in the case of a short<br>
block, respectively, and MDCT is performed 8 times. Then, the window type and<br>
window grouping information are transmitted to the bitstream forming portion 180.<br>
The same procedure as that used in the conventional MPEG-2 AAC [MPEG<br>
Committee ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11, ISO/IEC MPEG-2 AAC IS 13818-7, 1997]<br>
has been used heretofore.<br>
1.3. Temporal noise shaping portion (TNS)<br>
A temporal noise shaping portion defined in the MPEG-2 AAC International<br>
standards is used. The TNS 120 is an optional module and controls the temporal<br>
shape of the quantization noise within each window for conversion. The temporal<br>
noise shaping can be performed by filtering frequency data. The TNS 120<br>
transmits the TNS information to the bitstream forming portion 180.<br>
1.4. Intensity stereo processing portion<br>
An intensity stereo processing portion defined in the MPEG-2 AAC<br>
International standards is used. The intensity stereo processing portion 130 is one<br>
method for processing stereo signals more efficiently. The intensity stereo<br>
processing is performed such that only the quantized information of a scale factor<br>
band for one of two channels is coded, and only the scale factor for the other<br>
channel is transmitted. This module is an optional module and it is determined<br>
whether this module is to be used or not for each scale factor band considering<br>
various conditions. The intensity stereo processing module 130 transmits intensity<br>
stereo flag values to the bitstream forming portion 180.<br>
1.5. Predicting portion<br>
A predicting portion defined in the MPEG-2 AAC International standards is<br>
used. The predicting portion 140 is an optional module and predicts frequency<br>
coefficients of the present frame. Also, the predicting portion 140 transmits the<br>
parameters relating to prediction to the bitstream forming portion 180.<br>
1.6. Mid/Side (M/S) stereo processing portion<br>
An M/S stereo processing portion defined in the MPEG-2 AAC International<br>
standards is used. The M/S stereo processing portion 150 is an optional module<br>
and is one of methods for processing stereo signals more efficiently. M/S stereo<br>
processing is performed for converting a left-channel signal and a right-channel<br>
signal into an additive signal of two signals and a subtractive signal thereof.<br>
1.7. Quantizing portion<br>
The data converted into that of a frequency domain is quantized with<br>
increasing scale factors so that the SNR value of the scale factor band shown in<br>
Tables 1.1 and 1.2 is smaller than the SMR as the output value of the<br>
psychoacoustic model. Here, scalar quantization is performed, and the basic<br>
scale factor interval is 2¼. Quantization is performed so that the perceivable<br>
noise is minimized. The exact quantization procedure is described in the MPEG-2<br>
AAC. Here, the obtained output is quantized data and scale factors for the<br>
respective scale factor bands.<br><br><br>
1.8. Bit packing using Bit-sliced arithmetic coding<br>
Bit packing is performed by the bit-sliced arithmetic coding portion 170 and<br>
the bitstream forming portion 180. For convenient coding, frequency components<br>
are rearranged. The rearrangement order is different depending on block types.<br>
In the case of using a long window in the block type, the frequency components<br>
are arranged in the order of scale factor bands, as shown in FIG. 4. In the case<br>
of using a short window in the block type, each four frequency components from<br>
eight blocks are repeatedly arranged in increasing order, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The rearranged quantized data and scale factors are formed as layered<br>
bitstreams. The bitstreams are formed by syntaxes demonstrated in Tables 7.1<br>
through 7.13. The leading elements of a bitstream are elements which can be<br>
commonly used in the conventional AAC, and the elements newly proposed in the<br>
present invention are specifically explained. However, the principal structure is<br>
similar to that of the AAC standards.<br><br><br>
The elements newly proposed in the present invention will be specifically<br>
explained.<br>
1.8.1. Coding of bsac_channel_stream<br>
"common_window" represents whether two channels use the same format<br>
block, "ax_scalefactor[ch]" represents the maximum value of the scale factors,<br>
which is an integer, e.g., 8 bits. Also, "tns_data_resent[ch]" represents whether<br>
TNS is employed in the coding apparatus or not. "gain_control_data_present[ch]"<br>
represents a flag indicating that the time/frequency mapping method is used for<br>
supporting scalable sampling rate (SSR) in AAC. Also, "stereo_mode" represents a<br>
2-bit flag indicating a stereo signal processing method, in which "00" means<br>
independent, "01" means All ms_used are ones, "10" means 1 bit mask of max_sfb<br>
bands of ms_used is located in the layer side information part, "11" means 2 bit<br>
mask of max_sfb bands of stereo_info is located in the layer side information part.<br>
1.8.2. Coding of bsac_data<br>
"frame_length" represents the size of all bitstreams for one frame, which is<br>
expressed in units of bytes, e.g., 9 bits in the case of a mono signal (MS), and 10<br>
bits in the case of a stereo signal. Also, "encoded_layer" represents the coding<br>
for the top layer coded in the bitstream, which is 3 bits in the case of a 8-kbps<br>
interval and 6 bits in the case of a 1-kbps interval, respectively. The information<br>
for the enhancement layers is demonstrated in Tables 2.1 and 3.1. Also,<br>
"scalefactor_model [ch]" represents information concerning models to be used in<br>
arithmetic-coding differences in scale factors. These models are shown in Table<br>
4.2.<br><br>
"min_ArModer represents the minimum value of the arithmetic coding<br>
model indices. "ArModel_model" represents information concerning models used<br>
in arithmetic-coding the difference signal between the ArModel and min_ArModel.<br>
This information is shown in Table 4.3.<br>
[Table 4.3] Arithmetic Model of differential ArModel<br><br>
1.8.3. Coding bsac_side_info<br>
The information which can be used for all layers is first coded and then the<br>
side information commonly used for the respective enhancement layers is coded.<br>
"acode_ms_used [g][sfb]" represents a codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding<br>
ms_used, i.e., a 1-bit flag indicating whether or not M/S coding is performed in the<br>
window group g and scale factor band scf, in which ms_used is defined as follows:<br>
0: Independent<br>
1: ms_used.<br>
"acode_ms_used [g][sfb]" represents a codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding<br>
ms_used, i.e., a 1-bit flag indicating whether or not M/S coding is employed in the<br>
window group g and scale factor band scf, in which ms_used is defined as follows:<br>
0: Independent; and<br>
1: ms_used.<br>
"acode_stereo_info [g][sfb]" represents a codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding<br>
ms_used, i.e., a 2-bit flag indicating whether or not intensity stereo coding is<br>
employed in the window group g and scale factor band scf, in which stereo_info is<br>
defined as follows:<br>
00: Independent;<br>
01: ms_used;<br>
10: lntensity_in_phase; and<br>
11: lntensity_out_of_phase.<br>
"Acode_scf represents a codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding the scale factor,<br>
and "acode_ArModel" represents a codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding the<br>
ArModel. The ArModel is information on which is selected from the models listed<br>
in Table 4.3.<br>
1.8.4. Coding of bsac_spectral_data<br>
The side information commonly used for the respective enhancement<br>
layers, the quantized frequency components are bit-sliced using the BSAC<br>
technique and then arithmetic-coded. "acode_vec0" represents a codeword<br>
obtained by arithmetic-coding the first subvector (subvector 0) using the arithmetic<br>
model defined as the ArModel value. "acode_vec1" represents a codeword<br>
obtained by arithmetic-coding the second subvector (subvector 1) using the<br>
arithmetic model defined as the ArModel value, "acode_sign" represents a<br>
codeword obtained by arithmetic-coding the sign bit using the arithmetic model<br>
defined in Table 5.15.<br><br>
While the number of bits used in coding the respective subvectors are<br>
calculated and compared with the number of available bits for the respective<br>
enhancement layers, when the used bits are equal to or more than the available<br>
bits, the coding of the next enhancement layer is newly started.<br>
In the case of a long block, the bandwidth of the base layer is limited up to<br>
the 21st scale factor band. Then, the scale factors up to the 21st scale factor<br>
band and the arithmetic coding models of the corresponding coding bands are<br>
coded. The bit allocation information is obtained from the arithmetic coding<br>
models. The maximum value of the allocated bits is obtained from the bit<br>
information allocated to each coding band, and coding is performed from the<br>
maximum quantization bit value by the aforementioned encoding method. Then,<br>
the next quantized bits are sequentially coded. If allocated bits of a certain band<br>
are less than those of the band being currently coded, coding is not performed.<br>
When allocated bits of a certain band are the same as those of the band being<br>
currently coded, the band is coded for the first time. Since the bitrate of the base<br>
layer is 16 Kbps, the entire bit allowance is 336 bits. Thus, the total used bit<br>
quantity is calculated continuously and coding is terminated at the moment the bit<br>
quantity exceeds 336.<br>
After all bitstreams for the base layer (16 Kbps) are formed, the bitstreams<br>
for the next enhancement layer are formed. Since the limited bandwidths are<br>
increased for the higher layers, the coding of scale factors and arithmetic coding<br>
models is performed only for the newly added bands to the limited bands for the<br>
base layer. In the base layer, uncoded bit-sliced data for each band and the bit-<br>
sliced data of a newly added band are coded from the MSBs in the same manner<br>
as in the base layer. When the total used bit quantity is larger than the available<br>
bit quantity, coding is terminated and preparation for forming the next<br>
enhancement layer bitstreams is made. In this manner, bitstreams for the<br>
remaining layers of 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 Kbps can be generated.<br>
2. Decoding procedure<br>
2.1. Analysis and decoding of bitstreams<br>
2.1.1. Decoding of bsac_channel_stream<br>
The decoding of bsac_channel_stream is performed in the following order.<br>
First, max_scale factor is obtained. Then, ics_info () is obtained. If TNS data is<br>
present, TNS data is obtained. If there are two channels, stereo_mode is obtained<br>
and then BSAC data is obtained.<br>
2.1.2. Decoding of bsac_data<br>
The side information necessary in decoding frame_length, encoded_layer,<br>
scale factor models and arithmetic models is decoded in the bitstream.<br>
2.1.3. Decoding of bsac_stream<br>
The BSAC streams have a layered structure. First, the side information for<br>
the base layer is separated from the bitstream and then arithmetic-decoded.<br>
Then, the bit-sliced information for the quantized frequency components is<br>
separated from the bitstream and then arithmetic-decoded. Then, the side<br>
information for the next enhancement layer is decoded and the bit-sliced<br>
information for the quantized frequency components is arithmetic-decoded.<br>
The decoding of side information for the respective enhancement layers and<br>
the decoding of bit-sliced data are repeatedly performed until the enhancement<br>
layer is larger than the coded layer.<br>
2.1.4. Decoding of stereo_info or ms_used<br>
The decoding of stereo_info or ms_used is influenced by stereojnode<br>
representing a stereo mask. If the stereojnode is 0 or 1, the decoding of<br>
stereojnfo or ms_used is not necessary.<br>
If the stereo_mode is 1, all of the ms_used are 1. The information for the<br>
ms_used is transmitted to the M/S stereo processing portion so that M/S stereo<br>
processing occurs. If the stereojnode is 2, the value of the ms_used is arithmetic-<br>
decoded using the model demonstrated in Table 5.13. Also, the information for<br>
the ms_used is transmitted to the M/S stereo processing portion so that M/S<br>
stereo processing occurs.<br><br>
If the stereojnode is 3, the stereojnfo is arithmetic-decoded using the<br>
model demonstrated in Table 5.14. The decoded data is transmitted to the M/S<br>
stereo processing portion or the intensity stereo processing portion so that M/S<br>
stereo processing or intensity stereo processing occurs in units of scale factor<br>
bands, as described in AAC.<br><br>
2.1.5. Decoding of bsac_side_info<br>
The scalable bitstreams formed in the above have a layered structure.<br>
First, the side information for the base layer is separated from the bitstream and<br>
then decoded. Then, the bit-sliced information for the quantized frequency<br>
components contained in the bitstream of the base layer is separated from the<br>
bitstream and then decoded. The same decoding procedure as that for the base<br>
layer is applied to other enhancement layers.<br>
2.1.5.1. Decoding of scale factors<br>
The frequency components are divided into scale factor bands having<br>
frequency coefficients that are multiples of 4. Each scale factor band has a scale<br>
factor. There are two methods for decoding scale factors. The method to be<br>
used is known from scf_coding value.<br>
First, the max_scalefactor is decoded into an 8-bit unsigned integer.<br>
Generally, during coding, values obtained by mapping differences are coded.<br>
Thus, for the respective scale factor bands, the mapped values are arithmetic-<br>
decoded using models demonstrated in Table 5.2. At this time, if the arithmetic-<br>
decoded value is 54, which means that the mapped value is greater than or equal<br>
to 54, since the difference between 54 and the mapped value is coded again, the<br>
coded difference is decoded again to be restored into a value greater than or<br>
equal to 54. If the decoding of the mapped values is completed, the mapped<br>
values are inversely mapped by a difference signal. The mapping and the inverse<br>
mapping are performed using mapping tables demonstrated in Tables 5.1 and 5.2.<br>
The first scale factor can be obtained using the difference signal between<br>
max_scalefactor and itself.<br>
Second, the max_scalefactor is decoded into 8-bit unsigned integer. For all<br>
scale factors, differences between an offset value, i.e., the max_scalefactor and all<br>
scale factors are arithmetic-decoded. The scale factors can be obtained by<br>
subtracting the difference signals from the max_scalefactor. The arithmetic<br>
models used in decoding the differences are one of the elements forming the<br>
The frequency components are divided into coding bands having 32<br>
frequency coefficients to be losslessly coded. The coding band is a basic unit<br>
used in the lossless coding.<br>
The arithmetic coding model index is information on the models used in<br>
arithmetic-coding/decoding the bit-sliced data of each coding band, indicating<br>
which model is used in the arithmetic-coding/decoding procedures, among the<br>
models listed in Table 4.4.<br><br>
Differences between an offset value and all arithmetic coding model indices<br>
are calculated and then difference signals are arithmetic-coded using the models<br>
listed in Table 4.3. Here, among four models listed in Table 4.3, the model to be<br>
used is indicated by the value of ArModel_model and is stored in the bitstream as<br>
2 bits. The offset value is a 5-bit min_ArModel value stored in the bitstream. The<br>
difference signals are decoded in the reverse order of the coding procedure and<br>
then the difference signals are added to the offset value to restore the arithmetic<br>
coding model indices.<br>
The following pseudo code describes the decoding method for the<br>
arithmetic coding model indices and ArModel[cband] in the respective<br>
enhancement layers.<br><br>
Here, layer_sfb[layer] is a start scale factor band for decoding arithmetic<br>
coding model indices in the respective enhancement layers, and layer_sfb[layer+1]<br>
is an end scale factor band. decode_cband[ch][g][cband] is a flag indicative of<br>
whether an arithmetic coding model has been decoded (1) or has not been<br>
decoded (0).<br>
2.1.6. Decoding of bit-sliced data<br>
The quantized sequences are formed as bit-sliced sequences. The<br>
respective four-dimensional vectors are subdivided into two subvectors according<br>
to their state. For effective compression, the two subvectors are arithmetic-coded<br>
as a lossless coding. The model to be used in the arithmetic coding for each<br>
coding band is decided. This information is stored in the ArModel.<br>
As demonstrated in Tables 6.1 through 6.31, the respective arithmetic-<br>
coding models are composed of several low-order models. The subvectors are<br>
coded using one of the low-order models. The low-order models are classified<br>
according to the dimension of the subvector to be coded, the significance of a<br>
vector or the coding states of the respective samples. The significance of a vector<br>
is decided by the bit position of the vector to be coded. In other words, according<br>
to whether the bit-sliced information is for the MSB, the next MSB, or the LSB, the<br>
significance of a vector differs. The MSB has the highest significance and the<br>
LSB has the lowest significance. The coding state values of the respective<br>
samples are renewed as the vector coding is progressed from the MSB to the<br>
LSB. At first, the coding state value is initialized as zero. Then, when a non-zero<br>
bit value is encountered, the coding state value becomes 1.<br><br>

The two subvectors are one- through four-dimensional vectors. The<br>
subvectors are arithmetic-coded from the MSB to the LSB, from lower frequency<br>
components to higher frequency components. The arithmetic coding model<br>
indices used in the arithmetic-coding are previously stored in the bitstream in the<br>
order from low frequency to high frequency, before transmitting the bit-sliced data<br>
to each coding band in units of coding bands.<br>
The respective bit-sliced data is arithmetic-coded to obtain the codeword<br>
indices. These indices are restored into the original quantized data by being bit-<br>
coupled using the following pseudo code.<br>
"pre_state[]" is a state indicative of whether the currently decoded value is 0<br>
or not. "snf is significance of a decoded vector. "Idx0" is a codeword index whose<br>
previous state is 0. "idx1" is a codeword index whose previous state is 1.<br>
"dec_sample[]" is decoded data. "start_i" is a start frequency line of decoded<br>
vectors.<br><br>
While the bit-sliced data of quantized frequency components is coded from<br>
the MSB to the LSB, when the sign bits of non-zero frequency coefficients are<br>
arithmetic-coded. A negative (-) sign bit is represented by 1 and a positive (+)<br>
sign bit is represented by 0.<br>
Therefore, if the bit-sliced data is arithmetic-decoded in a decoder and a<br>
non-zero arithmetic-decoded bit value is encountered first, the information of the<br>
sign in the bitstream, i.e., acode_sign, follows. The sign_bit is arithmetic-decoded<br>
using this information with the models listed in Table 5.9. If the sign_bit is 1, the<br>
sign information is given to the quantized data (y) formed by coupling the<br>
separated data as follows.<br>
if (y l= 0)<br>
if (sign_bit == 1)<br>
y = -y<br>
2.2. M/S stereo processing portion (optional module)<br>
It is known by the flag contained in the bitstream and ms_used[] whether an<br>
M/S stereo processing module for each scale factor band is used or not. If used,<br>
the M/S stereo processing is performed using the same procedure as<br>
demonstrated in AAC.<br>
2.3. Predicting portion (Optional module)<br>
It is known by the flag contained in the bitstream and prediction_present<br>
whether a predicting module for scale factor band is used or not. If used, the<br>
prediction is performed using the same procedure as demonstrated in AAC.<br>
2.4. Intensity stereo processing portion (optional module)<br>
It is known by the flag contained in the bitstream and stereo_info whether a<br>
intensity stereo processing module for each scale factor band is used or not. If<br>
used, the intensity stereo processing is performed using the same procedure as<br>
demonstrated in AAC.<br>
2.5. TNS portion (optional module)<br>
It is known by the flag contained in the bitstream and tns_present whether a<br>
TNS module is used or not. If used, the TNS is performed using the procedure<br>
demonstrated in AAC.<br>
2.6. Inverse quantization<br>
The inverse quantizing portion restores the decoded scale factors and<br>
quantized data into signals having the original magnitudes. The inverse quantizing<br>
procedure is described in the AAC standards.<br>
2.7. Frequency/time mapping<br>
The frequency/time mapping portion inversely converts audio signals of a<br>
frequency domain into signals of a temporal domain so as to be reproduced by a<br>
user. The formula for mapping the frequency domain signal into the temporal<br>
domain signal is defined in the AAC standards. Also, various items such as a<br>
window related to mapping are also described in the AAC standards.<br>
The present invention allows a similar performance to that of a conventional<br>
encoder in which only compression is taken into consideration, at a higher bitrate,<br>
so as to process both mono signals and stereo signals to satisfy various user<br>
requests, while flexible bitstreams are formed. In other words, by user request,<br>
the information for the bitrates of various layers is combined with one bitstream<br>
without overlapping, thereby providing bitstreams having good audio quality. Also,<br>
no converter is necessary between a transmitting terminal and a receiving<br>
terminal. Further, any state of transmission channels and various user requests<br>
can be accommodated.<br>
Also, the scalability is applicable to stereo signals as well as mono signals.<br>
The present invention is adoptable to the conventional audio<br>
encoding/decoding apparatus having modules for improving coding/decoding<br>
efficiency, thereby improving the performance at various bitrates.<br>
Also, in the present invention, while the basic modules used in AAC<br>
standard coding/decoding such as time/frequency mapping or quantization are<br>
used, only the lossless coding module is replaced with the bit-sliced encoding<br>
method to provide scalability.<br>
Since the bitstreams are scalable, one bitstream may contain various<br>
bitstreams having several bitrates. Unlike the conventional coders, the scalable<br>
coder according to the present invention has finer graded enhancement layers,<br>
and thus the application range is broadened.<br>
Also, in contrast with other scalable audio codecs, good audio quality is<br>
offered at a higher bitrate.<br>
If the present invention is combined with the AAC standards, almost the<br>
same audio quality can be attained at the bitrate of the top layer.<br>
According to the present invention, while using the conventional audio<br>
algorithm such as the MPEG-2 AAC standards, only the lossless coding portion is<br>
different from the conventional one. Thus, the quantized signals of a frequency<br>
domain is decoded in the AAC bitstream, and the BSAC scalable bitstreams can<br>
be formed based on the decoded signals. In other words, lossless transcoding is<br>
allowed. Also, AAC bitstreams can be formed from BSAC scalable bitstreams in<br>
reverse order. Due to these functionalities, various AAC bitstreams formed only<br>
for enhancing coding efficiency are convertably used according to its environment.<br>
Thus, to allow for scalability, twofold or trifold work for forming bitstreams for<br>
providing scalability is not necessary by a separate coding apparatus.<br>
. Also, the present invention has good coding efficiency, that is, the best<br>
performance is exhibited at a fixed bitrate as in the conventional coding<br>
techniques, and relates to a coding/decoding method and apparatus in which the<br>
bitrate coded suitable for the advent of multimedia technology is restored. Also,<br>
according to the present invention, data for bitrates for various enhancement<br>
layers can be represented within one bitstream. Thus, according to the<br>
performance of users" decoders and bandwidth/congestion of transmission<br>
channels or by the users" request, the sizes of the bitrates or the complexity<br>
thereof can be controlled.<br>
