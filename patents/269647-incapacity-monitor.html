				<td>Incapacity Monitor<br>
This invention relates to monitoring inattention and particularly incapacity in<br>
vehicle drivers or machinery operators.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
The detection of drowsiness is of importance because drowsiness impairs the<br>
ability of operators of a wide range of equipment including motor vehicles, aircraft<br>
and boats as well as industrial equipment<br>
WO 03/039358 disclosed an alertness monitor that used infra red light to measure<br>
the amplitude and velocity of eyelid and eye movements to derive a measure of<br>
Drowsiness on a scale. This monitor sought to provide a real time alertness<br>
monitor that can provide a calibrated measure of the operator's alertness.<br>
There is a recent concern with the problem of driver distraction, not just<br>
drowsiness. By distraction they mean displacement of the driver's focus of visual<br>
attention from the driving task, either to a non-visual task (eg talking to other<br>
people in the vehicle, or the use of mobile phones), or to an alternative, visual task<br>
that reduces driving safety temporarily (reading a map or navigation system,<br>
adjusting a CD player or radio, etc). Thus, driver distraction is concerned with<br>
attention that is focused inappropriately, in direction and duration, for safe driving.<br>
The concept of a driver's incapacity seems to be applied primarily in the rail<br>
industry. It refers to some medical or other condition that makes the driver lose<br>
consciousness, not just enter the readily reversible states of drowsiness sleep, or<br>
distraction. This has been a major focus of interest in Australia after the a rail crash<br>
in which the driver died of a heart attack', but the train kept going and was derailed,<br>
killing passengers. The medical conditions that are most likely to be involved in<br>
such incidents are sudden death (eg heart attack or stroke), hypoglycaemia in<br>
diabetics, and epileptic seizures.<br>
There is current system of vigilance detection in trains which involves the driver<br>
pushing a button or making some adjustment to the train controls (change speed,<br>
apply brakes etc) once every 90 sees (approx) or a siren will be sounded and the<br>
brakes applied to stop the train. However the drivers only have to be moderately<br>
alert for about 1 sec to push the button at any time during the 90-sec period. They<br><br>
could easily be asleep for a minute at a time, repeatedly, without this being<br>
detected by current system.<br>
USA patent 6102870 uses eye tracker data such as fixations and saccades to infer<br>
mental states of the operator such as scanning, reading, searching, thinking and<br>
an intention to select. It is a system to enhance computer software<br>
responsiveness.<br>
USA patent 6346887 uses a video based eye tracking system which tracks eye<br>
activity and pupil diameter and position to produce a signal representing eye<br>
activity that can be used to estimate alertness.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide an improved alertness monitor of the type<br>
disclosed in WO 03/039358 which can deal with incapacity.<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
To this end the present invention provides a system for monitoring incapacity<br>
which includes<br>
a)	means to measure eye and eyelid movements<br>
b)	storage means to continuously record the measurements<br>
c)	a data processor to analyze eye and eyelid movements to obtain measures<br>
of ocular quiescence and/or duration of eye lid closure and measuring the<br>
deviation from a predetermined value for alert subjects<br>
d)	an alarm means triggered by the measurement reaching a predetermined<br>
value.<br>
Sometimes drivers can apparently be looking straight ahead, with their eyes wide<br>
open, but they actually have their attention focused elsewhere (eg with stressful<br>
intrusive thoughts). Alternatively, in the drowsy state, they may have their eyes<br>
open but not seeing and not aware of anything. Neither of these situations would<br>
be detected by a video camera. However, the infra red detection system disclosed<br>
in WO 03/039358   can measure levels of drowsiness continuously. The optimum<br>
duration of "distraction" that should trigger a warning is of the order of 2 to 5<br>
seconds when a vehicle is moving or a machine is in operation.<br>
The infra red detection system disclosed in WO 03/039358 can also measure<br>
periods when there are no eye or eyelid movements. Prolonged ocular quiescence<br>
is a good marker of "incapacity". The mean duration of ocular quiescence (DOQ)<br><br>
per minute is the mean of the intervals between consecutive eye and eyelid<br>
movements of any kind, including saccades, blinks, vestibulo-ocular movements,<br>
etc. Relatively long periods of ocular quiescence are typical of the drowsy state for<br>
many subjects. This invention is in partly based on the analysis of the duration of<br>
such intervals for truck drivers on the road and train drivers actually driving a train.<br>
Drivers usually make some sort of eye or eyelid movement (saccades, blinks,<br>
vestibulo-ocular movements, etc) several times per sec.<br>
Ocular quiescent periods of more than about 6 sec are rare and are used in this<br>
invention as a trigger for "potential incapacity" warning. This is preferably followed<br>
by further specific testing of the driver by asking him to push a button as soon as<br>
possible after the warning is given. This would overcome the occasional problem<br>
of false positive warnings and the brakes being applied inappropriately. Warnings<br>
caused by occasional prolonged periods of ocular quiescence that are not caused<br>
by incapacity are easily negated by the operator providing an appropriate response<br>
to the potential incapacity warning.<br>
Each potential incapacity warning triggered by ocular quiescence requires a<br>
response from the operator. Such an action by the operator indicates that the<br>
warning was a false positive and would focus the operator's attention back on the<br>
task of driving or machine operation as the case may be.<br>
If the operator does not respond an emergency procedure can be implemented.<br>
The emergency procedure will vary according to the type of vehicle or machine<br>
being operated and may include braking the vehicle to bring it to a stop and/or<br>
transmitting a report to a central control post.<br>
Thus in another aspect this invention provides a method of controlling a vehicle or<br>
machine in which the operator is monitored by<br>
a)	continuously monitoring one or more of eye and eyelid movements<br>
including saccades and blinks in at least one eye of the operator<br>
b)	analyzing said eye and eyelid movements to obtain a measure of<br>
ocular quiescence and measuring the deviation from a<br>
predetermined value for alert subjects<br>
c)	providing a warning when the measure deviates a predetermined<br>
amount which requires a response within a predetermined period<br><br>
d) applying an emergency procedure if no response is made within the<br>
predetermined time.<br>
Eyelid movement and saccades may be monitored using any suitable technology<br>
including video or digital camera technology to identify and measure the<br>
appropriate eye movements. However the apparatus and aigortitms disclosed in<br>
WO 03/039358 are preferred.<br>
Description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a frequency histogram illustrating the frequency of various periods of<br>
ocular quiescence in train drivers;<br>
Figure 2 is a frequency histogram illustrating the frequency of various periods of<br>
ocular quiescence in car drivers;<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart of one embodiment of an incapacity monitor according to<br>
this invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The eye monitoring apparatus used in this invention is of the same kind as<br>
described in the inventor's earlier patent application WO 03/039358.<br>
WO 03/039358 described glasses with transducers (IR-LEDs and phototransistors)<br>
on both eyes. The reason for this was that binocular coordination changed with<br>
drowsiness which made it essential to record from both eyes. However, based on<br>
further research by the inventor, it appears that the measurement of binocular<br>
coordination becomes more inaccurate as drowsiness progresses. Thus where the<br>
measurement of binocular coordination is not required recordings from one eye<br>
are sufficient for all other parameters.<br>
It is now preferred to position two infrared emitters and at least one photo<br>
transistor detector located on the lower frame member below one eye. Duri9ng<br>
fitting of the device to an individual the emitter which provides the best signal is<br>
chosen for that individual.<br>
Currently, video camera methods for monitoring drowsiness have both practical<br>
and theoretical problems. Some of the latter may be overcome in the future if the<br>
frame rate of cameras can be increased to about 500 Hz, which may allow<br><br>
velocities and AVRs to be measured. At this time infra red emission and detection<br>
is the preferred technology.<br>
Figure 1 is a frequency histogram of 59,310 intervals without eye or eyelid<br>
movement in two train drivers over 4 hours. Figure 2 is a frequency histogram of<br>
141278 intervals without eye or eyelid movement in seven car drivers over 6<br>
hours. As can be seen from the survey results illustrated in figures 1 and 2 an<br>
ocular quiescent period of 4 or 5 seconds or greater is sufficiently rare that a<br>
warning which requires a response from the operator would not be too frequent to<br>
be irritating or annoying. The appropriate time can be determined by conducting a<br>
preliminary survey of a sample of drivers or operators for each type of vehicle or<br>
machine.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram of the operation of an incapacity monitor according to<br>
this invention designed for use on trains.<br>
The first step in a cyclic procedure is to check if the glasses frame carrying the<br>
emitters and detectors is being worn. If they are not being worn and the speed of<br>
the train is above a preset minimum speed (such as in the shunting yard) a<br>
warning is given to prompt the train driver to put the glasses on. If no response is<br>
received the brake warning is given and then if no response is given the braking<br>
system of the train is automatically actuated.<br>
When a period of ocular quiescence greater than the predetermined period is<br>
detected a warning is provided which requires the train driver to press a button and<br>
this response returns the detector to the normal detection cycle.<br>
If no response is given within an appropriate predetermined period (about 2<br>
seconds) the trains braking system is actuated.<br>
If no period of ocular quiescence greater than the predetermined maximum is<br>
detected no warning is given.<br>
The periods of ocular quiescence and the time required for a response can be<br>
determined by selecting values that will provide fewer warnings without increasing<br>
the risk of an accident.<br>
From the above description it can be seen that the present invention provides a<br>
unique measure of incapacity and a reliable predictor of a person's capacity to<br>
operate machinery or vehicles.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will realize that the benefits of this invention can be<br>
achieved by embodiments of the apparatus and methodology other than those<br>
described without departing from the core teachings of this invention.<br><br>
