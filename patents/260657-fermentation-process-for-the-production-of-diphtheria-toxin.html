FERMENTATION PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DIPHTHERIA TOXIN<br>
The present invention relates to the field of diphtheria antigens, in particular toxins<br>
(including mutant forms of diphtheria toxin, such as CRM197) and fermentation<br>
processes for the manufacture of bulk cultures of such antigens.<br>
Diphtheria toxin is a protein exotoxin produced by the bacterium Corynebacterium<br>
diphtheria. It is produced as a single polypeptide that is readily spliced to form two<br>
subunits linked by a disulphide bond, Fragment A and Fragment B, as a result of cleavage<br>
at residue 190, 192 or 193 (Moskaug et al Biol. Chem. 264: 15709-15713, 1989.<br>
Fragment A is the catalytically active portion and is an NAD-dependent ADP-<br>
ribosyltransferase which specifically targets a protein synthesis factor EF-2, thereby<br>
inactivating EF-2 and shutting down protein synthesis in a cell.<br>
Immunity to a bacterial toxin such as diphtheria toxin may be acquired naturally during the<br>
course of infection, or artificially by injection of a detoxified form of the toxin (toxoid)<br>
(Germanier, er, Bacterial Vaccines, Academic Press, Orlando, Fl., 1984). Toxoids have<br>
traditionally been made by by chemical modification of native toxins (Lingood et al Brit.J.<br>
Exp. Path. 44; 177, 1963), rendering them non-toxic while retaining an antigenicity that<br>
protects the vaccinated animal against subsequent challenge by the natural toxin.<br>
Alternatively, several mutated diphtheria toxins have been described which have reduced<br>
toxicity (US4709017, US4950740).<br>
CRM197 is a non-toxic form of the diphtheria toxin but is immunologically<br>
indistinguishable from the diphtheria toxin. CRM197 is produced by C. diphtheriae<br>
infected by the nontoxigenic phase p197tox- created by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of<br>
the toxigenic carynephage b (Uchida et al Nature New Biology (1971) 233; 8-11). The<br>
CRM197 protein has the same molecular weight as the diphtheria toxin but differs from it<br>
by a single base change in the structural gene. This leads to a glycine to glutamine<br>
change of amino acid at position 52 which makes fragment A unable to bind NAD and<br>
therefore non-toxic (Pappenheimer 1977, Ann Rev, Biochem. 46; 69-94, Rappuoli<br>
Applied and Environmental Microbiology Sept 1983 p560-564).<br>
Diphtheria toxoid and a mutant form with reduced toxicity, CRM197, are components in<br>
many vaccines providing immunity against Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Several<br>
combination vaccines are known which can prevent Bordetella pertussis, Clostridium<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
tetani, Corynebactehum diphtheriae, and optionally Hepatitis B virus and/or Haemophilus<br>
intluenzae type b (see, for instance, WO 93/24148 and WO 97/00697, WO 02/055105).<br>
Diphtheria toxin and mutant forms including CRM197 have also been used in vaccines as<br>
safe and effective T-cell dependent carriers for saccharides . CRM197 is currently used in<br>
the Haemophilus influenzae type b oligosaccharide CRM197 conjugate vaccine (HibTitre<br>
Â®; Lederle Praxis Biologicals, Rochester, N.Y.).<br>
Methods of preparing diphtheria toxoid (DT) are well known in the art. For instance, DT<br>
may be produced by purification of the toxin from a culture of Corynebacterium<br>
diphtheriae followed by chemical detoxification, or may be made by purification of a<br>
recombinant, or genetically detoxified analogue of the toxin (for example, CRM197, or<br>
other mutants as described in US 4,709,017, US 5,843,711, US 5,601,827, and US<br>
5,917,017). Corynebacterium diphtheriae is cultured under aerobic conditions. Rappuoli et<br>
al (Biotechnology February 1985, p161-163) suggest that pO2 should be regulated at<br>
25% by aerating with a mixture of air and oxygen which is automatically regulated to<br>
maintain the desired pO2.<br>
Production of significant quantities of diphtheria toxins such as CRM197 for use in<br>
vaccines has been hindered due to low protein abundance. This problem has been<br>
addressed previously by introducing further copies of a gene encoding diphtheria toxin or<br>
a mutant form into Corynebacterium diphtheriae (US 4,925,792; US 5,614,382). Such<br>
methods lead to an increase in production of about three-fold. Methods of further<br>
improving diphtheria toxin yields in a reproducible manner would be of benefit to allow<br>
higher levels of production of these valuable antigens.<br>
Accordingly, the present application provides an improved fermentation process<br>
comprising a fermentation step of growing a strain of Corynebacterium diphtheria in<br>
medium in a fermenter under conditions of agitation sufficient to maintain a homogenous<br>
culture and limited aeration such that pO2 within the culture falls to less than 4% for the<br>
majority of the fermentation step.<br>
The fermentation takes place under aerobic, but limited aeration conditions such that<br>
oxygen is used up as soon as it enters the culture during the majority of the fermentation,<br>
i.e. after the initial phase in which the density of C. diphtheriae is relatively low and pO2<br>
levels may be higher. The inventors have found that culture under such conditions results<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br><br>
in more efficient and/or consistent expression of diphtheria toxin or mutant compared to<br>
fermentation methods carried out at higher pO2. The process of the invention is more<br>
robust than fermentation at higher levels of oxygen, and allows yields of diphtheria toxin to<br>
remain high even when the culture medium contains added iron or when complex raw<br>
materials of variable quality are used.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for manufacturing a<br>
preparation of diphtheria toxin or mutant thereof comprising carrying out the fermentation<br>
process of the invention and isolating diphtheria toxin or mutant thereof from the culture.<br>
Although diphtheria toxin and mutants are described herein, it is envisaged that any C.<br>
diphtheriae antigen may be isolated using the process of the invention.<br>
The use of such a method results in higher yields of diphtheria toxin or mutant, for<br>
example CRM197, compared to when 5% pO2 or higher e.g. 20% is maintained.<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a diphtheria toxin or mutant thereof<br>
isolated by the process of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the diphtheria toxin or mutant thereof of the invention and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a diphtheria toxin or mutant thereof<br>
for use in therapy, particularly for the treatment of prevention of bacterial disease such as<br>
C. diphtheriae disease.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a use of the diphtheria toxin or mutant<br>
thereof of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention<br>
of bacterial disease, particularly C. diphtheriae disease.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preventing or treating<br>
bacterial infection, particularly C. diphtheriae infection comprising administration of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention to a patient.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The terms "comprising", "comprise" and "comprises" herein are intended by the inventors<br>
to be optionally substitutable with the terms "consisting of, "consist of and "consists of,<br>
respectively, in every instance.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a fermentation process comprising a fermentation step of<br>
growing a strain of Corynebacterium diphtheria in medium in a fermenter under conditions<br>
of agitation sufficient to maintain a homogenous culture (for example sufficient to produce<br>
a mixing time of less than 30, 20, 15,10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 seconds) and limited<br>
aeration such that pO2 within the culture falls to less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 1% or 0.5% for<br>
the majority of the fermentation step. In a preferred embodiment, the pO2 falls to<br>
approaching zero, preferably for the majority of the fermentation step.<br>
For example, the pO2 within the culture falls to less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 1% or 0.5% from<br>
the time when the Corynebacterium diphtheria has grown to a density sufficient for it to<br>
consume most of the oxygen as soon as the oxygen enters the culture (the latency phase,<br>
for example from at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 hours after the start of fermentation), until the<br>
point in the fermentation when the pO2 concentration rises again, close to the end of the<br>
fermentation step (for example 16, 18, 20, 22 or 24 hours after the latency phase).<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br><br>
Fermentation typically ends and the culture is harvested when pO2 rises above limited<br>
aeration conditions. It should be noted that under different inoculation conditions, for<br>
example where the fermentor is inoculated with a much larger culture of C. diphtheriae,<br>
limited aeration conditions commence from shortly after the start of fermentation (for<br>
example 1, 5, 10, 20, 30,40 or 60 minutes after the start of fermentation).<br>
A 100% pO2 is the amount of oxygen present when the medium (in the absence of a<br>
culture) is saturated with oxygen following bubbling compressed air through the medium<br>
at 34.5Â°C and pressure of 0.5bar. For a 150Litre fermentor, the aeration rate and agitation<br>
speed should be set at 23 litres/min and 240rpm, whereas for a 20 Litre fermentor, the<br>
aeration rate and agitation speed should be set at 3 litres/min and 300rpm. It may be set<br>
as the amount of oxygen present in a fully aerated fermentation medium prior to<br>
inoculation.<br>
A homogenous culture is a culture in which the bacteria are evenly dispersed throughout<br>
the fermenter such that at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10% of the bacteria are present in the<br>
uppermost 10% of the culture medium.<br>
A fermentation step is defined as the step in which Corynebacterium diphtheriae is<br>
cultured within the fermenter. The fermentation step commences with the introduction of<br>
the preculture into the fermenter and ends when, under the limited aeration conditions<br>
described herein, the pO2 eventually increases to above 10%. The fermentation step<br>
typically lasts for over 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or 24 hours, for example between 16 and 40<br>
hours, or for example between 22 and 28 hours.<br>
Agitation is optionally by stirring the culture in the fermenter but may be by any other<br>
suitable means, for example by agitation, vibromixer and/or gas bubbling. Agitation is<br>
sufficient to produce a mixing time for the culture of less than 20, 15, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2<br>
or 1 seconds.<br>
A mixing time of a culture can be measured in a glass fermentor. It is the time taken after<br>
the introduction of a coloured aqueous solution for the coloured aqueous solution to be<br>
evenly dispersed throughout the culture medium.<br>
A fermenter is any apparatus suitable for the industrial production of bacterial cultures.<br>
However this term does not include culture flasks which are typically used for growth of<br>
bacteria on a smaller scale.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
The majority of the fermentation step is defined as a time of more than 50%, 60%, 70%,<br>
80% or 90% of the total length of the fermentation step. The fermentation is typically<br>
under limited aeration conditions for 12,14,16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 , 26 or 28 hours.<br>
Limited aeration describes aeration conditions which allow the C. diphtheriae to use<br>
aerobic respiration and yet limits the amount of oxygen available such that, after the<br>
culture has increased in density (for instance after at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10<br>
hours of fermentation) oxygen is consumed very shortly after entering the culture so that<br>
the pO2 is less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0.5%. It should be noted that by increasing the<br>
quantity of culture used to inoculate the fermentor, the limited aeration conditions could be<br>
achieved very shortly after inoculation (for example after 1,5, 10, 20 or 30 minutes after<br>
start of fermentation).<br>
Such limited aeration conditions lead to robust expression of a toxin such as diphtheria<br>
toxin or mutants thereof.<br>
A pO2 falling to approaching zero is achieved by the rate of aeration and agitation being<br>
such that oxygen introduced into the culture is used up by the culture for respiration soon<br>
after its introduction into the culture so that despite aeration of the culture, the pO2 is read<br>
as zero or close to zero on an oxygen monitor.<br>
During the fermentation step, the pO2 will start at a higher level for a given setting of<br>
agitation and rate of aeration. This is because the density of bacteria in the culture is low<br>
at the start of the fermentation step and increases during the fermentation step. A period<br>
of time (for example, up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 hours) is typically required before<br>
the pO2 falls to less than 5%. From this point onwards, the pO2 remains below 5, 4, 3, 2,<br>
1 or 0.5%, preferably at a level approaching zero until close to the end of the fermentation<br>
step for instance till the harvesting of the fermenter.<br>
Optionally, the fermentation step is carried out at constant KLa throughout the<br>
fermentation step. Alternatively, the fermentation step is carried out at at one or more KLa<br>
such that limited aeration is achieved at the KLa values present during the majority (at<br>
least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%) of the fermentation step.<br>
KLa is a measure of the rate at which oxygen enters the culture. The higher the KLa, the<br>
greater the rate at which oxygen is introduced into the culture. Several factors including<br>
the medium volume and composition, agitation, aeration, pressure, temperature and the<br>
position and characteristics of mobile parts of the fermenter will influence the KLa of a<br>
particular fermentation step.<br>
Typically, oxygen is introduced into the fermentation culture by bubbling compressed air<br>
through the culture. Where different concentrations of oxygen are present in the air<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
introduced into the culture, the flow rate should be adapted to take account of this. For<br>
instance, where a supply of 100% oxygen is introduced into the culture, the flow rate<br>
would be correspondingly lower. Where gas containing less oxygen than air is introduced<br>
into the culture, a higher flow rate could be applied.<br>
KLa can be measured using the method described in Example 1. The method involves<br>
setting up the fermenter with the conditions of medium volume, temperature, pressure,<br>
agitation and aeration for which the KLa is to be measured, gassing out by replacing the<br>
air with nitrogen gas, gassing in by restoring air aeration and measuring the rate at which<br>
pO2 returns to its steady state level.<br>
ln(100-pO2) = -KLa.T + C<br>
By plotting In (100-pO2) against time, the gradient (or angular coefficient) of the line is -<br>
KLa.<br>
The KLa of a fermentation step is influenced by a number of factors including the amount<br>
of agitation of the culture and the aeration rate of the culture. A constant KLa may be<br>
maintained while for instance decreasing the agitation of the culture and increasing the<br>
aeration rate or vice versa. However, in an embodiment, both the agitation of the culture<br>
and the aeration rate are constant during the fermentation step.<br>
The fermentation step is carried out, for example, at a KLa of between 10-200h-1, 10 -<br>
150 h-1, 10 - 100 h-1, 10-80 h-1, 10-50 h-1, 10-40h-1, 10-30 h-1, 20-150 h-1, 20-100 h-<br>
1, 20-50 h-1, 20-60 h-1, 20-80 h-1, 20-30 h-1, 20-40 h-1, 30-60 h-1, 60-80 h-1, 60-150 h-<br>
1 or 60-200 h-1.<br>
The KLa of the fermentation process of the invention may differ, depending on the size of<br>
the fermentation culture. For cultures of 10-30 litres, a KLa of 10-30 h-1, 15-30, 20-30 or<br>
22-28 h-1 can be used. For cultures of 30-250 litres, a KLa of 30-60 or 40-50 h-1 can be<br>
used. For cultures of 250-800 litres a KLa of 30-50, 40-50, 40-60, 30-60, 30-80 or 60-150<br>
h-1 can be used. For cultures of 800-3000 litres a KLa of 30-50, 40-50, 40-60, 30-60, 30-<br>
80, 60-150 or 60-200 h-1 can be used.<br>
For a fermentation culture size of 10-30 litres, a KLa of 10-30 h-1 is achieved for example<br>
by using an airflow or aeration rate of 1-5 litres/min and an agitation speed of 200-<br>
400rpm, for example an aeration rate of 2-4 litres/min and an agitation speed of 250-<br>
350rpm.<br>
For a fermentation culture of 30-250 litres, a KLa of 30-60 h-1 is achieved for example by<br>
using an airflow rate of 15-25 litres/min and an agitation speed of 150-250 rpm, for<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
example by using an airflow rate of 20-25 litres/min and an agitation speed of 200-250<br>
rpm, for example by using an airflow rate of 15-20 litres/min and an agitation speed of<br>
200-250 rpm.<br>
The pH of the culture of C. diphtheriae in CY medium during the fermentation step<br>
depends on the conditions of aeration and agitation of the culture (Nikolajewski et al J.<br>
Biological Standardization, 1982, 10; 109-114). At the start of the fermentation step, the<br>
pH of the CY medium is 7.4. In the case of low aeration or KLa, the pH drops to around 5.<br>
In the case of high aeration, the pH increases up to around 8.5. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the C. diphtheriae is cultured in CY medium or SOC medium (Sambrook J et al<br>
1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor, NY) or similar media. The pH within the fermenter may be held<br>
between 7.0 and 7.8, by the degree of aeration, optionally without requiring addition of<br>
acid or base.<br>
The process of the invention can be used with any strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.<br>
Such strains may produce wild type diphtheria toxin, fusion proteins including diphtheria<br>
toxin or fragment thereof (e.g. those disclosed in US 5863891) or mutant forms or<br>
fragments of diphtheria toxin, preferably those which have reduced toxicity. Examples of<br>
such mutant toxins are CRM176, CRM 197, CRM228, CRM 45 (Uchida et al J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 218; 3838-3844, 1973); CRM 9, CRM 45, CRM102, CRM 103 and CRM107 and<br>

In an embodiment, the following strains of C. diphtheriae are used in the processes of the<br>
invention; ATCC39255, ATCC39526, ATCC11049, ATCC11050, ATCC11051,<br>
ATCC11951, ATCC11952, ATCC13812, ATCC14779, ATCC19409, ATCC27010,<br>
ATCC27011, ATCC27012, ATCC296, ATCC43145, ATCC51280 or ATCC51696.<br>
The medium for use in the invention may contain one or more of the following<br>
constituents: 5-20 g/L, 10-16g/L or 10g/L casamino acids or casein hydrolysate, 5-20 g/L,<br>

WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
It is known that iron content of the growth medium can affect the growth of C. diphtheriae<br>
and influence toxin production (see WO 00/50449). Iron is essential for bacterial growth,<br>
however, iron in large concentrations has been shown to inhibit the production of toxin.<br>
During the process of the invention, the iron content of the medium has a lower level of<br>
10, 50, 75, 100, 120 or 150 ppb and an upper limit of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800,<br>
900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 ppb. For example, iron concentrations in the<br>
medium are: 50-1000ppb, 100-1000ppb, 200-1 OOOppb, 400-1 OOOppb, 500-1500ppb, 700-<br>
1300ppb, 50-2000ppb, 100-2000ppb, 200-2000ppb, 400-2000ppb, 700-2000ppb, 50-<br>
3000ppb, 100-3000ppb, 200-3000ppb, 400-3000ppb, 700-3000ppb, 1000-3000ppb, 1500-<br>
3000ppb, 1700-3000ppb, 50-4000ppb, 100-4000ppb, 200-4000ppb, 400-4000ppb, 700-<br>
4000ppb, 1000-4000ppb, 1500-4000ppb, 1700-4000ppb or 2000-4000ppb. The iron may<br>
be in the form of Fe2+ and/or Fe3+.<br>
In an embodiment, the process of the invention is sufficiently tolerant to the presence of<br>
iron salts in the medium such that no treatment of the medium to remove iron in required<br>
before use.<br>
The fermentation step takes place at a temperature suitable for the culture of C.<br>
diphtheriae, for example 25-45 Â°C, 25-40 Â°C, 30-38 Â°C, or 34-35 Â°C.<br>
The fermentation step is subject to a large amount of foam production. In order to control<br>
foam formation an antifoam agent is optionally added to the fermenter. Optionally a foam<br>
probe or mechanical foam breaker is used in the fermentor, for example as well as the<br>
antifoam agent.<br>
A second aspect of the invention is a process for manufacturing a preparation of an<br>
antigen, for instance, diphtheria toxin or mutant or fragment thereof comprising the steps<br>
of carrying out the fermentation process of the invention as described above and isolating<br>
the antigen, for example, diphtheria toxin or mutant or fragment thereof from the culture.<br>
A third aspect of the invention is a diphtheria toxin or mutant or fragment thereof (for<br>
example CRM197) isolated by the process of the invention.<br>
The toxicity of the diphtheria toxin is optionally reduced by chemical treatment including<br>
treatment with cross-linking reagents to form a toxoid. References to a toxin include<br>
toxoids.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
diphtheria toxin or mutant (for example CRM197) of fragment thereof of the invention and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention optionally further comprises additional<br>
antigens in a combination vaccine. In an embodiment, antigen(s) to be combined with the<br>
diphtheria toxin, mutant or fragment thereof as described above include one or more of<br>
tetanus toxoid, whole cell pertussis (Pw), acellular pertussis (Pa) (as described below),<br>
Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis A virus, Haemophilus influenzae b polysaccharides<br>
or oligosaccharides, neisserial (e.g. N. meningitidis) polysaccharides or oligosaccharides,<br>
N. meningitidis serotype B proteins, optionally as part of an outer membrane vesicle,<br>
pneumococcal polysaccharides or oligosaccharides, pneumococcal proteins or any of the<br>
antigens listed below. Bacterial polysaccharides may be conjugated to a carrier protein.<br>
Diphtheria toxin or toxoid or mutants of diphtheria toxin such as CRM197 or fragments, for<br>
example made using a process of the invention, may be used as carrier protein. However<br>
other carrier proteins such as tetanus toxoid, tetanus toxoid fragment C, pneumolysin,<br>
Protein D (US6342224) may also be used. A given pharmaceutical composition optionally<br>
contains multiple polysaccharides or oligosaccharides conjugated to different carrier<br>
proteins.<br>
Diphtheria toxin, or mutant thereof, for example CRM197, or fragment thereof made using<br>
the process of the invention may be formulated with capsular polysaccharides or<br>
oligosaccharides derived from one or more of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus<br>
influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group A Streptococci, Group B Streptococci,<br>
Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. For example, the pharmaceutical<br>
or immunogenic composition may comprise capsular polysaccharides derived from one or<br>
more of serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y of Neisseria meningitidis. For example<br>
serogroups A and C; A and W, A and Y; C and W, C and Y, W and Y; A, C and W; A C<br>
and Y; A, W and Y; C, W and Y or A, C, W and Y may be formulated with CRM197. In<br>
another example, the immunogenic composition comprises capsular polysaccharides<br>
derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide<br>
antigens are preferably selected from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11 A,<br>
12F, 14,15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F (most preferably from serotypes<br>
1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F). A further example would contain the PRP<br>
capsular polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides) of Haemophilus influenzae type b. A<br>
further example would contain the Type 5, Type 8, 336, PNAG or dPNAG capsular<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
polysaccharides of Staphylococcus aureus. A further example would contain the Type I,<br>
Type II, Type III or PIA capsular polysaccharides of Staphylococcus epidermidis. A further<br>
example would contain the Type la, Type Ic, Type II or Type III capsular polysaccharides<br>
of Group B streptocoocus. A further example would contain the capsular polysaccharides<br>
of Group A streptococcus, optionally further comprising at least one M protein and more<br>
preferably multiple types of M protein.<br>
The bacterial polysaccharides for use in the invention may be full length, being purified<br>
native polysaccharides. Alternatively, the polysaccharides are sized between 2 and 20<br>
times, for example 2-5 times, 5-10 times, 10-15 times or 15-20 times, so that the<br>
polysaccharides are smaller in size for greater manageability. Oligosaccharides typically<br>
contain between 2 and 20 repeat units.<br>
Such capsular polysaccharides may be unconjugated or conjugated to a carrier protein<br>
such as tetanus toxoid, tetanus toxoid fragment C, diphtheria toxoid or CRM197 (both for<br>
example made by the method of the invention), pneumolysin, or Protein D (US6342224).<br>
Tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin and pneumolysin are detoxified either by genetic mutation<br>
and/or by chemical treatment.<br>
The polysaccharide or oligosaccharide conjugate may be prepared by any known<br>
coupling technique. For example the polysaccharide can be coupled via a thioether<br>
linkage. This conjugation method relies on activation of the polysaccharide with 1-cyano-<br>
4-dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to form a cyanate ester. The<br>
activated polysaccharide may thus be coupled directly or via a spacer group to an amino<br>
group on the carrier protein. Optionally, the cyanate ester is coupled with hexane diamine<br>
and the amino-derivatised polysaccharide is conjugated to the carrier protein using<br>
heteroligation chemistry involving the formation of the thioether linkage. Such conjugates<br>
are described in PCT published application WO93/15760 Uniformed Services University.<br>
The conjugates can also be prepared by direct reductive amination methods as described<br>
in US 4365170 (Jennings) and US 4673574 (Anderson). Other methods are described in<br>
EP-0-161-188, EP-208375 and EP-0-477508.<br>
A further method involves the coupling of a cyanogen bromide activated polysaccharide<br>
derivatised with adipic acid hydrazide (ADH) to the protein carrier by Carbodiimide<br>
condensation (Chu C. et al Infect. Immunity, (1983) 245; 256).<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
In particular examples the diphtheria toxin or fragment of mutant thereof (for example<br>
CRM197) is conjugated to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or<br>
20 additional antigens of the pharmaceutical composition. In an embodiment, it is<br>
conjugated to polysaccharide component(s), for instance bacterial polysaccharides<br>
including those listed above.<br>
The pharmaceutical or immunogenic composition of the invention may further comprise<br>
additional protein components. It is optionally formulated with antigens providing<br>
protection against one or more of tetanus and Bordetella pertussis infections. The<br>
pertussis component may be killed whole cell B. pertussis (Pw) or acellular pertussis (Pa)<br>
which contains at least one antigen (preferably two or all three) from PT, FHA and 69kDa<br>
pertactin. Certain other acellular pertussis formulations also contain agglutinogens such<br>
as Fim2 and Fim 3 and these vaccines are also contemplated for use in the invention.<br>
Typically, the antigen providing protection against Tetanus is tetanus toxoid which is<br>
either chemically inactivated toxins (for example, following treatment with formaldehyde)<br>
or inactivated by the introduction of one or more point mutation(s).<br>
The pharmaceutical or immunogenic composition of the invention optionally comprises<br>
pneumococcal proteins antigens, for example those pneumococcal proteins which are<br>
exposed on the outer surface of the pneumococcus (capable of being recognised by a<br>
host's immune system during at least part of the life cycle of the pneumococcus), or are<br>
proteins which are secreted or released by the pneumococcus. For example, the protein<br>
may be a toxin, adhesin, 2-component signal tranducer, or lipoprotein of Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae, or fragments thereof. Examples of such proteins include, but are not limited<br>
to: pneumolysin (preferably detoxified by chemical treatment or mutation) [Mitchell et at.<br>

The pharmaceutical or immunogenic composition of the invention optionally comprises<br>
one or more antigens that can protect a host against non-typeable Haemophilus<br>
influenzae, RSV and/or one or more antigens that can protect a host against influenza<br>
virus.<br>
Examples of non-typeable H. influenzae protein antigens include Fimbrin protein (US<br>

13<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
It should be appreciated that antigenic compositions of the invention may comprise one or<br>
more capsular polysaccharide from a single species of bacteria. Antigenic compositions<br>
may also comprise capsular polysaccharides derived from one or more species of<br>
bacteria.<br>
A further aspect of the invention includes immunogenic compositions or vaccines<br>
comprising the diphtheria toxin, fragment or mutant thereof (for example CRM197) made<br>
by the processes of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Optionally, the immunogenic composition or vaccine contains an amount of an adjuvant<br>
sufficient to enhance the immune response to the immunogen. Suitable adjuvants<br>
include, but are not limited to, aluminium salts, squalene mixtures (SAF-1), muramyl<br>
peptide, saponin derivatives, mycobacterium cell wall preparations, monophosphoryl lipid<br>
A, mycolic acid derivatives, non-ionic block copolymer surfactants, Quil A, cholera toxin B<br>
subunit, polphosphazene and derivatives, and immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs)<br>
such as those described by Takahashi et al. (1990) Nature 344:873-875. For veterinary<br>
use and for production of antibodies in animals, mitogenic components of Freund's<br>
adjuvant can be used.<br>
As with all immunogenic compositions or vaccines, the immunologically effective amounts<br>
of the immunogens must be determined empirically. Factors to be considered include the<br>
immunogenicity, whether or not the immunogen will be complexed with or covalently<br>
attached to an adjuvant or carrier protein or other carrier, route of administrations and the<br>
number of immunising dosages to be administered. Such factors are known in the<br>
vaccine art and it is well within the skill of immunologists to make such determinations<br>
without undue experimentation.<br>
The active agent can be present in varying concentrations in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition or vaccine of the invention. Typically, the minimum concentration of the<br>
substance is an amount necessary to achieve its intended use, while the maximum<br>
concentration is the maximum amount that will remain in solution or homogeneously<br>
suspended within the initial mixture. For instance, the minimum amount of a therapeutic<br>
agent is preferably one which will provide a single therapeutically effective dosage. For<br>
bioactive substances, the minimum concentration is an amount necessary for bioactivity<br>
upon reconstitution and the maximum concentration is at the point at which a<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
homogeneous suspension cannot be maintained. In the case of single-dosed units, the<br>
amount is that of a single therapeutic application. Generally, it is expected that each dose<br>
will comprise 1-100|a.g of protein antigen, preferably 5-50ï­g and most preferably 5-25ï­g.<br>
Preferred doses of bacterial polysaccharides are 10-20ï­g, 10-5ï­g, 5-2.5ï­g or 2.5-1ï­g.<br>
The preferred amount of the substance varies from substance to substance but is easily<br>
determinable by one of skill in the art.<br>
The vaccine preparations of the present invention may be used to protect or treat a<br>
mammal (for example a human patient) susceptible to infection, by means of<br>
administering said vaccine via systemic or mucosal route. These administrations may<br>
include injection via the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal or subcutaneous<br>
routes; or via mucosal administration to the oral/alimentary, respiratory, genitourinary<br>
tracts. Although the vaccine of the invention may be administered as a single dose,<br>
components thereof may also be co-administered together at the same time or at different<br>
times (for instance if polysaccharides are present in a vaccine these could be<br>
administered separately at the same time or 1-2 weeks after the administration of the<br>
bacterial protein combination for optimal coordination of the immune responses with<br>
respect to each other). In addition to a single route of administration, 2 different routes of<br>
administration may be used. For example, viral antigens may be administered ID<br>
(intradermal), whilst bacterial proteins may be administered IM (intramuscular) or IN<br>
(intranasal). If polysaccharides are present, they may be administered IM (or ID) and<br>
bacterial proteins may be administered IN (or ID). In addition, the vaccines of the<br>
invention may be administered IM for priming doses and IN for booster doses.<br>
Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design ("The subunit and adjuvant<br>
approach" (eds Powell M.F. &amp; Newman M.J.) (1995) Plenum Press New York).<br>
Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, US Patent 4,235,877.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for manufacturing a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a step of making the diphtheria toxin or fragment or mutant<br>
thereof (for instance CRM197) using the fermentation process of the invention and<br>
combining it with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally adding any of the<br>
additional antigens mentioned above.<br>
Such a process may further comprise a step of conjugating the diphtheria toxin or<br>
fragment or mutant thereof (for instance CRM197) to one or more additional components<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
of the pharmaceutical composition, preferably bacterial polysaccharides or<br>
oligosaccharides as described above.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is use of the diphtheria toxin or fragment or mutant<br>
thereof (for instance CRM197) of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the<br>
treatment or prevention of bacterial disease, in particular C. diphtheriae disease.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method of preventing or treating bacterial infection, in<br>
particular C. diphtheriae infection, comprising administration of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition, immunogenic composition or vaccine of the invention to a patient.<br>

The invention is illustrated in the accompanying examples. The examples below are<br>
carried out using standard techniques, which are well known and routine to those of skill<br>
in the art, except where otherwise described in detail. The examples are illustrative , but<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Measurement of KLa<br>
In order to measure the KLa of a fermentation step, the fermenter was filled with the<br>
desired volume of water and the fermentation parameters (for instance temperature,<br>
pressure, agitation and aeration) were applied and the system left to achieve a steady<br>
state. The pO2 probe was calibrated at 100%.<br>
The aeration was shifted rapidly to nitrogen gas, while maintaining the same flow rate.<br>
The pO2 was followed until pO2 dropped to less than 5%. When this point was reached,<br>
the aeration was shifted rapidly to air while maintaining the same flow rate. The pO2 level<br>
was followed and recorded at several time points as a percentage of the original steady<br>
state 100% level.<br>
KLa was calculated by plotting the log (100-pO2%) against time. The angular coefficient<br>
of the linear part of the graph corresponds to -Kla. Typically, only data between 20% and<br>
80% pO2 are considered.<br>
Results<br>
The pO2 readings at various time points are shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Time (seconds)	Time (hours)	pO2 (%)	ln(100-pO2)<br>
200	0.056	20	4.382026635<br>
210	0.058	21.9	4.357990057<br>

The results were plotted out as shown in figure 1 and the KLa determined from the<br>
angular coefficient of the line in Figure 1B.<br>
Example 2: Fermenation of C. diphtheriae strain ATCC 39255 at 150 Litre scale<br>
The bacterium used in the preparation of CRM197 (Cross Reacting Material) is a mutant<br>
strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae obtained by nitrosoguanidine treatment according<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
to the method of A. Pappenheimer (Nature New Biol. 233:8-11, 1971). It expresses a<br>
detoxified diphtheric toxin (aa 52: glycine to glutamic acid mutation). It was obtained from<br>
the ATCC where it is referred to as 39255. The general outline of the fermentation<br>
process is shown in Figure 2.<br>
A working seed containing 1.1x1010 cfu/ml was withdrawn from the freezer (-70Â°C) and<br>
thawed at room temperature. Immediately after thawing, the vial was vortexed and 250 ï­l<br>
of the seed are taken with a 1ml syringe with needle.<br>
This volume was injected in 100 ml of sterile saline solution (0.9%). The flask was<br>
agitated. Two ml of the suspension were taken with a 2ml syringe with needle and used to<br>
inoculate a 3-L erlenmeyer containing 500 mL of the medium described in US4,925,792.<br>
The flask was incubated at 34.5Â°C + 0.5Â°C under 250 rpm agitation speed until the optical<br>
density (650 nm) reached 4.0 to 6.0 (after 16 to 19h of incubation).<br>
A 150 litre fermenter was sterilised and 100 L of culture medium were aseptically<br>
transferred into the fermenter. The acid bottle was filled with 500 mL H3PO4 25 % (V/V);<br>
the pH of the medium was initially around 7.4 and was not adjusted.<br>
The fermenter was prepared the day before the inoculation and was kept in stand-by<br>
conditions of 34.5Â°C temperature, 0.5 barg pressure, air flow of 23 N L/min in the<br>
headspace and agitation speed 50rpm for 16-20 h, until inoculation.<br>
Prior to inoculation, the fermenter was set to the culture conditions of 34.5Â°C temperature,<br>
0.5 bar pressure, air flow of 23 N L/min sparged in the medium and agitation speed<br>
240rpm. An agitation of 240 rpm gives a tip speed of 1.76 m/s and a theoretical mixing<br>
time of 3.9 seconds. The dissolved oxygen is not regulated, only monitored, the foam<br>
control system was switched on and the pH was allowed to reach 7.8 and therefafter<br>
maintained by addition of H3PO4. Prior to inoculation, the pO2 probe was set to 100%.<br>
The agitation speed was set at 240 rpm, corresponding to a peripheral speed<br>
of 1.76 m/s. The agitation speed of 240 rpm combined with an aeration rate of 23-L/min<br>
resulted in a KLa (20-80%, water 30Â°C, 0.5 bar) estimated at 42 h-1 (see Figure 6).<br>
The fermenter was inoculated through the inoculum port with 400 ml of the seed culture<br>
described above.<br>
Fermentation continued until both of the following conditions were met. 20 hours of<br>
fermentation are elapsed and dissolved oxygen level had increased to 10%. The total<br>
fermentation duration was generally between 22 and 28 h.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
At the end of the fermentation, the temperature was changed to a setting of 20Â°C, the pH<br>
regulation was turned off, the air flow was shifted to the headspace in order to limit the<br>
foaming, the foam control system was turned off, the other parameters were not changed.<br>
The microfiltration system was connected to the fermenter and when the temperature of<br>
the suspension reached 21Â°C, the microfiltration started. The microfiltration was operated<br>
in two phases: a concentration and a diafiltration. During the concentration phase, the<br>
parameters were: pressure in: 0.6 bar, pressure out: -0.1 bar, permeate flow: maintained<br>
constant at 2L/min using a calibrated peristaltic pump (the permeate pressure was about<br>
0.3 bar). The suspension was concentrated until one of the following events first<br>
happened. Either the inlet pressure reached 0.9 bar or 75 litres of permeate were<br>
recovered.<br>
During the diafiltration phase, the following parameters were used: pressure in was kept<br>
at the pressure reached at the end of the concentration step (0.9 bar maximum); water<br>
was added at 2 litres/min; total water added was 3 volumes of retentate.<br>
The retentate was filtered on a 0.22 urn membrane and stored at +4Â°C. The stability of the<br>
CRM 197 in such suspension was tested after up to 4 days of storage at either +4Â°C or at<br>
room temperature (+20Â°C<rt no degradation and differences were observed></rt>
either by ELISA quantification or on SDS-page. A test for confirmation of absence of<br>
growth was done on BAB agar incubated at 36Â°C.<br>
Results<br>
Two fermentations at 150-L scale were carried out using the protocol of fermentation<br>
described above (CDT 199 and CDT 206). The conditions of preculture and culture are<br>
shown in Tables 2 and 3 and yields of CRM197 are shown in Table 4. Figure 3 shows a<br>
graph of the typical kinetics of growth of a preculture. When the O.D. (650 nm) was<br>
between 4.0 and 6.0, the culture was clearly in an exponential phase of growth and the<br>
pH changed only slightly.<br>

During the fermentation, different phases were observed.<br>
The first phase was characterised by a decrease of the dissolved oxygen until 0% was<br>
reached (duration of around 6-7 h). During this phase, the pH remains stable or slightly<br>
decreases (by about 0.1 pH unit).<br>
During the second phase the pH increased and reached a plateau at about pH 7.8. At this<br>
level, pH regulation was triggered however often no acid at all had to be added under<br>
these fermentation conditions. During this plateau of pH, an increase of the dissolved<br>
oxygen level above 0% followed by a drop to 0% was observed.<br>
The third phase was characterised by a decrease of the pH to about 7.4.<br>
Finally an increase of pO2 was observed between 22 and 24 h of fermentation. This is the<br>
signal for harvest.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
The exhaust gases of the fermenter were analysed by mass spectrometer. A typical<br>
profile of CO2 production was observed.<br>
The two fermentations presented were prolonged after the signal of harvest in order to<br>
estimate the kinetics of CRM 197 production. We observed that the CRM 197 level does<br>
not increases after the signal of harvest was reached but there was an increase in foam<br>
production. In order to limit the antifoam consumption, it is preferable to stop the<br>
fermentation at the signal to harvest. However, the CRM 197 seems not affected by<br>
excessive foaming and no degradation occurred.<br>
Microfiltration<br>
Data are shown for the microfiltration of CDT206.<br>
74.3 L of permeate were harvested when the inlet pressure reached 0.9 bars. The<br>
outlet pressure was between 0.15 and 0.10 bar throughout the concentration step. The<br>
permeate pressure was 0.3-0.4 bar throughout the concentration step and the<br>
concentration step lasted for 36 minutes.<br>
For the diafiltration phase, 75-L of water were progressively added (2 L/min) while the<br>
permeate was extracted at the same flow rate. The inlet pressure was 0.9 bar at the<br>
beginning and dropped to 0.7 bar at the end of the diafiltration. The outlet pressure was<br>
stable at 0.1 bar. The duration of the diafiltration step was 39 min.<br>
CRM197 quantification<br>
The level of expression of CRM197 under the low aeration conditions was generally 2-4<br>
fold higher than that achieved under conditions of higher aeration where pO2 was<br>
maintained at 5% or higher throughout the fermentation.<br>
Stained SDS page of culture supernatants<br>
SDS-PAGE gels (Figure 4) were run of the culture supernatents under reducing condition<br>
so that it was possible to detect any degradation bands (after clipping, 2 sub-units of<br>
respectively 35 and 23 kD can be detected). They were subsequently stained with<br>
Coomassie Blue.<br>
Results<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
The coomassie stained gels of samples from the two fermentations are shown in Figure<br>
4A (CDT 199) and 4B (CDT 206). The CRM 197 appeared at the expected molecular<br>
weight (theoretical MW: 58.4 kD). The CRM 197 was not degraded since no pattern<br>
change was seen in samples taken after the signal of end of fermentation (Figure 4A,<br>
lanes 9 and 10). The CRM 197 quantity was not affected by the microfiltration and final<br>
filtration on 0.22uM since lane 9 and 11 of Figure 4A show equivalent amounts of<br>
CRM197.<br>
Temperature can have a negative effect on CRM stability (Figure 4B lane 12). This<br>
sample was taken while the sample valve was warm and the amount of CRM197 present<br>
in this sample is reduced.<br>
Example 3: Fermentation of C. diphtheriae strain ATCC 39255 at 20 litre scale<br>
A method similar to that described in example 2 was used to ferment C. diphtheriae<br>
except that a 20 litre fermentor was used. The culture was agitated at 300rpm and the air<br>
flow was set at 3 litre/minute. No addition of acid or base was required during the<br>
fermentation since the pH stayed around neutral throughout the fermentation.<br>
The culture grew to a final OD (650nm) of 18.3. The yield of CRM197 was found to be<br>
103mg/!itre as assessed by densitometry on a stained gel.<br>
Example 4: Fermenation of C. diphtheriae strain ATCC 39255 at different scales<br>
The fermentation process of growing C. diphtheriae under conditions of constant KLa can<br>
be adapted for use in fermenters of other sizes and different designs. Good yields of<br>
CRM197 production were achieved following the conditions of fermenter size, air flow and<br>
agitation speed indicated in Table 5. The three 150L scale fermentations were carried out<br>
in fermentors of different design.<br>
Table 5<br><br>

22<br><br>
WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
As shown in table 5, the KLa was important rather than a specific choice of air flow and<br>
agitation speed conditions. Thus a lower air flow could be compensated by a higher<br>
agitation speed to result in a similar KLa and the good yields of CRM197 were still<br>
achieved. The agitation speed should be sufficient to produce a homogeneous<br>
suspension and aeration is limited to maintain a low pO2. N.B. Different fermentors were<br>
used for the 20 litre fermentations. The different geometries of the different fermentors led<br>
to the range of kLa values shown in table 5.<br>
However, different KLa conditions were optimal for different scales of fermentation. Hence<br>
for fermentation in a 20 Litre fermenter, a lower KLa of 22-28 h-1 was optimal.<br>
Optimal KLa conditions are those that allow limited aeration such that the pO2 within the<br>
culture falls to low levels. One skilled in the art should easily be able to determine such<br>
condtions for a particular size and geometry of fermenter.<br>
Example 5: Effect of iron concentration on the yield of fermentations at different<br>
pO2.<br>
A series of fermentations of C. diphtheriae strain ATCC 39255 were carried out at 20 litre<br>
scale following the method set out in Example 3 so that pO2 was low throughout the<br>
majority of the fermentation or at a constant setting of 5% pO2. The amount of Fe3+<br>
present was varied between no Fe3+ addition, 25Oppb addition of Fe3+, 500 ppb Fe3+<br>
addition and 500ppb Fe2+ addition. The yield of CRM197 at the end of fermentation was<br>
measured by densitometry of an SDS-PAGE gel. This method tends to give results<br>
approximately 20% lower than those achieved by ELISA.<br>

WO 2006/100108	PCT/EP2006/002835<br>
As shown in table 6, .when C. diphtheriae is fermented at 5% pO2, the addition of iron<br>
leads to a reduction of yield. However, when the level of pO2 is reduced and the<br>
fermentation is carried out under the conditions of low pO2 at constant Kla as described in<br>
example 3, higher yields were achieved and the yield was not affected by the addition of<br>
Fe3+.<br>
Example 6: Effect of iron concentration on the yield of DT or CRM197 under low<br>
aeration conditions<br>
The range of iron concentration that does not impact expression of CRM197 was<br>
determined in microplates. Microplates simulate the limited aeration conditions existing in<br>
the fermentation process of the invention.<br>
Culture in microplates was performed in the same medium as was used in the<br>
fermentations described above ( in a medium similar to CY medium). Fe3+ was added<br>
from a stock solution of FeCI3.6H2O at 1 g/l Fe3+ ion.<br>
The wells of microtitre plates were filled with the medium and were inoculated at 8 E5<br>
bact/mL<br>
The microtitre plates were incubated at 34.5Â°C under agitation of 250 rpm for 46h in the<br>
case of both Corynebacterium diphtheriae expressing CRM197 and Corynebacterium<br>
diphtheriae expressing Diphtheria Toxin.<br>
The samples were filtered through a 0.22 urn filter.<br>
The expression was measured by densitometry method on SDSpage (XT Criterion 4-12%<br>
bis tris from BioRad) colored with Coomassie blue (Gelcode blue stain from Pierce). The<br>
reference used for the quantification was the diphtheria toxin CRM mutant of List<br>
Biological Laboratories INC, introduced at different concentrations on the gel.<br>
Results<br>
Table 7 shows the expression of CRM197 under different iron concentrations for C.<br>
diphtheriae grown under limited aeration conditions in microtitre wells. CRM197<br>
expression was poorly sensitive to repression by Fe3+ and was not significantly affected<br>
by addition of 1ppm or 2ppm Fe3+. Only at 3ppm did a significant drop in CRM 197<br>
expression occur. Even at this level of Fe3+, the expression of CRM197 was still 79% of<br>
that achieved with no addition of Fe3+.<br>
