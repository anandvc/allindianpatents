This invention relates to a device for feeding sliver from multiple rows of feed cans to textile draw frames.<br>
In the existing textile draw frame machines, sliver is fed from sliver cans to the inlets of the machines through guide assemblies. This guide assembly is fixedly mounted on the feeding device firame on the top on either side of the feeding device and the sliver from the can enters the inlet area through this guide assembly. The guide assembly is adjustable to a desired position to feed the sliver from the cans. In the existing textile draw frame machines feed cans are placed in a row, one behind the other to the maximum of four cans per row on either side of the feeding device. Sliver from these cans enters the inlet arrangement directly through the guide assembly and through the intake roller and contact roller which rotate simultaneously in opposite directions.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a device which can accommodate more number of feed cans in the existing system. This reduces the area of space occupied by the machinery by providing a more compact and efficient system.<br>
The device developed by us enables feeding of slivers from feed cans arranged in at least two rows of cans on ether side of the two feeding systems.<br><br>
The main support frame known as the feeding device frame is provided with connecting members extending therefrom to connect a guide holder. Plurality of external guide assemblies are located on the guide holder. The main support frame has a plurality of intake rollers and contact rollers disposed in pairs. Guide assemblies are also provided on stud like projections fixed to the main support frame. The intake roller and contact roller in each pair of the assembly is capable of rotating in opposite directions. The first set of intake and contact rollers are intended to guide sliver from the first row of cans. Similarly a second set of intake and contact roller pairs are provided for guiding sliver supplied by the second row of cans. The main frame has a stiver separator located near the inlet for advancing sliver fix&gt;m the main frame, in order to guide the advancing stiver and to avoid rubbing at high detivery speed.<br>
Each can of the first row may be located directly beneath a first pair of intake and contact roller pair, while each can of the second row may be placed adjacent to the first row. SUver from the first row of cans passes through a first set of intake and contact rollers where as the stiver fixnn the second row cans pass through a second set of intake and contact rollers through the external guide assembly in the guide holder.<br><br>
The connecting member and guide holders may be extended to accommodate as many rows and numbers of cans as desired.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a device for feeding sliver from multiple rows of feed cans to textile draw frames which comprises plurality of main support frame and a guide holder, a plurality of connecting members, conencting said guide holder to said main support frame, a plurality of internal guide assemblies and external guide assemblies located on said main frame and on said guide holder respectively; said main support frame being provided with at least a first and second pair of rollers, each pair consisting of an intake roller and a contact rdler, a first row of sliver cans being located beneath said refers, sliver therefinom passing through The internal guide assembly to said first pair of rollers, a second rows of sliver cans being located adjacent thereto the sliver therefrom passing through said external guide assembly in said guide holder to said second pair of rollers said support frame being provided with a sliver separator for guiding the advancing sliver to the inlet of the textile draw frame.<br>
This mvention will now be described with reference to the figures in tile accompanying drawings.<br>
The details of one of the main support frame and the arrangement of components connected are described and one more similar arrangement exist as shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the device while figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the parts and the sliver movement.<br>
In figure 1 the main support frame is indicated by reference numeral (8) and the guide holder by numeral (10). Connecting members which connect the guide holder to the support frame (8) are shown by (11, 11 a) and (lib). Guide assembly (4) is fixed to a stud like projection indicated by numeral (7) which is shown in the exploded view of the portion marked (X) in the main figure and shown separately. Internal guide assemblies (4) and (5) are fixed to the stud like projection. The guide holder (10) is provided with a plurality of external guide assemblies indicated by numerals (9), (9a), (9b) and (9c). Intake rollers are indicated by numerals (1,1a, 2, 2a) and the corresponding contact rollers are shown by numerals (3,3a, 3b and 3c). Known adjusting means is provided on the guide assembly (6) for adjusting the guide assembly to the desired position for proper guidance of sliver passing therethrough. Plurality of contact rollers provided in proximity to the intake rollers are represented by (12,12a, 12b and 12c). The intake rollers (1,1a, 2,2a) rotate in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the contact rollers. A sliver separator indicated by numeral (13) is provided on the main frame before the inlet arrangement (RI) for the textile drawing machinery. Two rows of sliver cans are represented by (Sci, Sci) respectively.<br>
Fig. 1(a) shows an exploded view of the portion marked as (X) in figure I.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the sliver flow from four rows of sliver cans. SI1 and SI2 indicate sliver from sliver can Sc1 and sliver can Sc2 respectively. Other parts in this figure are indicated by like reference numerals as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The sliver after passing the sliver guide enters the contact area of the intake roller and the contact roller which rotate in opposing directions. Sliver proceeds from this assembly to the inlet arrangement through sliver separator. Sliver from the second row of cans is fed at an angle of about 90°C to the direction of drafting system<br>
The guide assembly is preferably made of brass as this provides a high degree of surface finish to enable smooth running of sliver. Stivers from the second row pesacs through the external guide assembly before it enters the internal guide assembly. The distance between the rows of cans may be adjusted to accommodate the diameter of cans. Rows of sliver can be provided on either side of the main support frame. Preferably two rows of cans are provided on the left side and two rows on the right side.<br>
Though this invention has been described hereinabove with a specific embodiment, obvious modification and aherations known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of the invention claimed in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A device for feeding sliver from multiple rows of feed cans to textile draw frames comprising a main sui^rt frame (8) and a guide holder (10), a plurality of connecting members (ll,lla,llb) connecting said guide holder to said main frame, a plurality of internal guide assemblies (4,5) and external guide assemblies (9,9a,9b,9c) located on said mmn frame and said guide holder respectively, said main support frame being provided with at least a first and second pair of rollers, each pair consisting of an intake roller (1, la, 2,2a) and a contact roller (3,3a,3b,3c), a first row of sliver cans (Sci) being located below said rollers, sliver tfierefix&gt;m passing tiirough said internal guide assembly (4) to said first pair of rollers, the second row of sliver cans (Sca) being located adjacent thereto, the sliver therefix&gt;m passing through said external guide assembly in said guide holder, to said second pair of rollers through the internal guide assembly (5) said support fi'ame being provided with a sliver separator (13) for guiding the advancing sliver to the inlet of the textile draw fi-ame.<br>
