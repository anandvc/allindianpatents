				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a plant<br>
control system and in particular or system, to a<br>
thermal power plant.<br>
The plant control system processes a<br>
measurement signal of an operation state amount<br>
obtained from a plant to be controlled, calculates an<br>
operation signal to be supplied to the plant to be<br>
controlled, and transmits it as a control instruction<br>
to the control system.<br>
The plant control system uses an algorithm<br>
for calculating the operation signal so that the<br>
measurement signal of the plant operation state amount<br>
satisfies its target value.<br>
It is possible to use the PI<br>
(proportion/integration) control algorithm for<br>
controlling the plant.  In the PI control, the<br>
deviation of the plant measurement signal from its<br>
target value is multiplied by the proportion gain.  The<br>
obtained value is added by the value obtained by time-<br>
integrating the deviation so as to obtain the operation<br>
signal to be supplied to the object to be controlled.<br>
On the other hand, in order to automatically<br>
correct the control algorithm in accordance with a<br>
change of the plant operation state and the<br><br>
environment, the plant may be controlled by using the<br>
adaptive control and the learning algorithm.<br>
JP-A-2000-35956 discloses a control apparatus<br>
using a reinforced learning method using a model as a<br>
method for obtaining the operation signal of the<br>
control apparatus for controlling the plant by using<br>
the learning algorithm.<br>
In the method using the technique of the<br>
reinforced learning method, the control apparatus<br>
includes a model for predicting the characteristic of<br>
the object to be controlled and a learning part for<br>
learning the method for generating such a model input<br>
that a model output can achieve the target value.<br>
By inputting the model input learned by the<br>
learning part to the model, it is possible to obtain<br>
the effect that the model output approaches the target<br>
value.<br>
The learning type adaptive control corrects<br>
the model by using the measurement signal which has<br>
measured the plant operation state and performs re-<br>
learning by using the corrected model so as to perform<br>
online correction/modification of the control algorithm<br>
for accurately controlling the plant.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to correct the<br>
model within a cycle (control cycle) during which the<br>
operation signal outputted from the control apparatus<br>
is modified for the plant and use the corrected model<br>
for the re-learning so as to complete the learning and<br><br>
correct/modify the control algorithm.<br>
The control cycle can be considered as a time<br>
from the plant operation completion to the moment when<br>
the plant enters a static state, which is normally<br>
several minutes or several tens of minutes.<br>
For example, when controlling a complicated<br>
plant such as a thermal power plant, the model input<br>
dimension is several tens or several hundreds and the<br>
number of combinations of the learning model inputs<br>
(search space) increases, which in turn requires a long<br>
learning time.  As a result, it becomes difficult to<br>
online-correct/modify the control algorithm required<br>
for accurately controlling the plant.<br>
Consequently, in order to complete the<br>
learning within the control cycle, it is necessary to<br>
correct the model in accordance with increase of the<br>
model input dimension and increase the learning speed<br>
of re-learning by using the corrected model.<br>
JP-A-7-160661 discloses a technique for<br>
increasing the learning speed in a neural network<br>
learning by classifying teacher data into a plurality<br>
of patterns according to the combinations of the plant<br>
measurement information and extracting a learning<br>
pattern according to the control result so as to learn<br>
only the teacher data on the extracted pattern.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
By using the technique of the reinforced<br><br>
learning method using the model disclosed in JP-A-2000-<br>
35956, it is possible to automatically learn the method<br>
for generating an operation signal which can achieve<br>
the control target.<br>
However, when a model is corrected according<br>
to the measurement signal which has measured the plant<br>
operation state and the corrected model is used for re-<br>
learning so as to correct the control algorithm, the<br>
model input dimension increases in a complicated plant,<br>
which makes it difficult to perform the learning within<br>
the control cycle for controlling the plant.<br>
Moreover, when the technique disclosed in JP-<br>
A-7-160661 is used, it is possible to divide the<br>
teacher data by patterning so as to reduce the search<br>
space and increase the learning speed.  That is, even<br>
if the model input dimension increases and the search<br>
space (number of teacher data) increases, it is<br>
possible to perform learning within the control cycle<br>
by executing the appropriate patterning.<br>
However, when the teacher data to be<br>
classified is biased, the number of teacher data may be<br>
too small depending on the learning pattern and it may<br>
not be possible to acquire a desired learning result.<br>
Moreover, since the type of patterns to be<br>
classified is decided according to the knowledge of a<br>
designer of the control apparatus, there is a problem<br>
that the pattern generation requires a large load on<br>
the operator.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a plant control system which<br>
corrects a model in accordance with a measurement<br>
signal which has measured a plant operation state and<br>
uses the corrected model for re-learning, which enables<br>
execution of the high-speed learning for correcting the<br>
plant control algorithm and accurately controlling the<br>
plant.<br>
A plant control system for controlling a<br>
plant including an operation signal generation part<br>
which calculates an control instruction operation<br>
signal for a plant to be controlled by using a<br>
measurement signal which has measured an operation<br>
state of the plant, apparatus comprising: an operation<br>
signal database which stores the measurement signal of<br>
the measured plant; an operation signal database which<br>
stores an operation signal for the plant; a numerical<br>
calculation execution part which calculates the<br>
operation characteristic of the plant; a numerical<br>
calculation database which stores the numerical<br>
calculation result from the numerical calculation<br>
execution part; a simulation model which simulates<br>
control characteristic of a plant when the operation<br>
signal is supplied to the plant according to<br>
information on the numerical calculation result from<br>
the numerical calculation database; a learning part<br>
which learns the plant operation method by using the<br>
model; a learning information database which stores<br><br>
learning information data on the learning part; a<br>
control logic database which contains information used<br>
for the operation signal outputted from the operation<br>
signal generation part; a pattern generation part which<br>
generates pattern data expressing a state input based<br>
on the learning information data in the learning part<br>
with a smaller input number than the model input<br>
dimension; a pattern database which stores the pattern<br>
data generated in the pattern generation part; and a<br>
learning result determination part which selects a<br>
learning result having a preferable control effect from<br>
the learning result obtained by using a plurality of<br>
patterns; wherein the operation signal is calculated<br>
from the operation signal generation part according to<br>
the learning result selected by the learning result<br>
determination part.<br>
According to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to provide a plant control system which<br>
corrects a model according to a measurement signal<br>
which has measured the plant operation state and<br>
performs re-learning at a high speed by using the<br>
corrected model, thereby correcting the plant control<br>
algorithm so as to accurately control the plant.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Description will now be directed to a plant<br>
control system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention with reference to the attached<br>
drawings.<br><br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the entire<br>
configuration of the plant control system according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, the plant of the present<br>
embodiment is a plant 100 constituting a thermal power<br>
plant including a boiler using coal as fuel.  The<br>
thermal power plant 100 including the boiler is<br>
configured so as to be controlled by a control<br>
apparatus 200.<br>
The control apparatus 200 for controlling the<br>
plant 100 as a control object includes, as calculation<br>
apparatuses, a numerical calculation part 220, a model<br>
230, a learning part 260, an operation signal<br>
generation part 280, a learning result judging part<br>
300, and a pattern generation part 400.<br>
The control apparatus 200 includes as<br>
databases, a measurement signal database 210, a<br>
numerical calculation database 240, an operation signal<br>
database 250, a learning information database, a<br>
control logic database 290, and a pattern database 500.<br>
Furthermore, the control apparatus 200<br>
includes, as an external interface, an external input<br>
interface 201 and an external output interface 202.<br>
The control apparatus 200 acquires the<br>
measurement signal 1 which has measured various state<br>
amounts of a thermal power plant from the thermal power<br>
plant 100 via the external input interface 291.<br><br>
Moreover, the control apparatus 200 sends an<br>
operation signal 15 for controlling, for example, a<br>
burner of the boiler and an air flow rate of an air<br>
port via the external output interface 202 to the plant<br>
100 as the thermal power plant of the control object.<br>
In the control apparatus 200, the measurement<br>
signal 1 which has measured various state amounts of<br>
the plant 100 is sent to the external input interface<br>
201 and stored as the measurement signal 2 in the<br>
measurement signal database 210 as a database of the<br>
control apparatus 200.<br>
An operation signal 14 generated by an<br>
operation signal generation part 280 as a calculation<br>
apparatus provided in the control apparatus 200 is sent<br>
to the external output interface 202 and stored in the<br>
operation signal database 250 as a database provided in<br>
the control apparatus 200.<br>
The operation signal generation part 280 uses<br>
control logic data 13 stored in the control logic<br>
database 290 and learning data 12 outputted from the<br>
learning result determination part 300 as a calculation<br>
apparatus provided in the control apparatus 200 so as<br>
to generate the operation signal 14 functioning as the<br>
operation signal 15 for the plant 100, so that the<br>
measurement signal 1 of the plant 100 achieves an<br>
operation target value and outputs the signal to the<br>
external interface 202.<br>
The control logic database 290 contains a<br><br>
control circuit and a control parameter used for<br>
calculating the control logic data 13 so as to output<br>
the control logic data.<br>
The known PI control can be used in the<br>
control circuit for calculating the control logic data<br>
13.<br>
The learning data stored in the learning<br>
information database 270 as a database provided in the<br>
control apparatus 200 is generated by a learning part<br>
260 provided in the control apparatus 200.<br>
The learning part 260 is connected to the<br>
model 230 as a calculation apparatus provided in the<br>
control apparatus 200.<br>
The model 230 has a function for simulating<br>
the control characteristic of the plant 100 as the<br>
thermal power plant.  That is, the model 230 performs a<br>
calculation for simulation of the following: the<br>
operation signal 15 serving as a control instruction is<br>
supplied to the plant 100 so as to obtain the<br>
measurement signal 1 as the control result.<br>
For this simulation calculation, a model<br>
input 7 for operating the model 230 is received from<br>
the learning part 260 and the model 230 performs<br>
simulation calculation of the characteristic change by<br>
control of the plan so as to obtain a model output 8 as<br>
the result of the simulation calculation.<br>
Here, the model output 8 is a predicted value<br>
of the measurement signal 1 of the plant 100.<br><br>
The model 230 is configured according to the<br>
numerical calculation result 6 stored in the numerical<br>
calculation database 240 as a database provided in the<br>
control apparatus 2 00.<br>
The numerical calculation part 220 as a<br>
calculation apparatus provided in the control apparatus<br>
200 analyzes the operation characteristic of the plant<br>
100 by using a physical model simulating the plant 100.<br>
The calculation result 4 obtained by<br>
analyzing the characteristic of the plant 100 by using<br>
the physical model in the numerical calculation part<br>
220 is stored in the numerical calculation database<br>
240.<br>
The model 230 calculates a model output 8<br>
corresponding to the model input 7 by using information<br>
stored in the numerical calculation database 240 and<br>
the measurement signal database 210 and employing the<br>
statistical method such as the neural network.<br>
The model 230 extracts the numerical<br>
calculation result 6 required for calculating the model<br>
output 8 corresponding to the model input 7 from the<br>
numerical calculation database 240 by using the model<br>
information data 5 and interpolates the result.<br>
Moreover, the model 230 can be corrected by<br>
using the measurement signal 3 stored in the<br>
measurement database 210 so that the control<br>
characteristics of the model 230 and the plant 100<br>
coincide with each other when the characteristic of the<br><br>
physical model of the numerical calculation part 220 is<br>
different from the characteristic of the plant 100.<br>
The learning part 260 learns a method for<br>
generating the model input 7 so that the model output 8<br>
which is simulation-calculated by the model 230<br>
achieves the model output target value set in advance<br>
by an operation staff.<br>
Here, the current model input is inputted to<br>
the learning part 2 60 so as to output its model input<br>
change width.  Here, the input to the learning part 2 60<br>
will be called a state input and the output will be<br>
called an operation amount.<br>
The constriction condition used for learning<br>
and the learning information data 9 containing the<br>
model output target value are stored in the learning<br>
information database 270.<br>
The learning part 260 directly learns the<br>
state input before start of the plant operation and,<br>
after the start of the plant operation, performs<br>
learning by patterning the state input by using the<br>
pattern data stored in a pattern database 500 which<br>
will be detailed later.<br>
Moreover, the learning data 10 obtained as a<br>
result of the learning in the learning part 260 is<br>
stored in the learning information database 270<br>
provided in the control apparatus 200.<br>
The learning data 10 includes the state input<br>
before the model input modification, the operation<br><br>
amount at the state input, and information on the model<br>
output change width obtained as a result of the<br>
operation.  It should be noted that the functions of<br>
the learning part 260 will be detailed later.<br>
The pattern generation part 400 as a<br>
calculation apparatus provided in the control apparatus<br>
200 generates pattern data 17 by using the learning<br>
data 16 learned before the start of the plant operation<br>
in the learning part 260 and stores the pattern data 17<br>
in the pattern database 500.<br>
After operation of the plant 100 is started,<br>
optimal pattern data 18 similar to the measurement<br>
signal 3 is selected from the pattern data stored in<br>
the pattern database 500 and the learning part 260<br>
patterns the state input contained in the measurement<br>
signal 3.<br>
The learning data 11 obtained by the learning<br>
in the learning part 260 and stored in the learning<br>
information database 270 is inputted to a learning<br>
result determination part 300 as a calculation<br>
apparatus provided in the control apparatus 200.<br>
When a plurality of pattern data 18 are used<br>
for the learning, the learning result determination<br>
part 300 selects the learning data which makes the<br>
control effect to be maximum from the respective<br>
pattern learning data 11.  When only one pattern is<br>
used, the learning data on the pattern is selected.<br>
The learning data 12 selected by the learning<br><br>
result determination part 300 is inputted the operation<br>
signal generation part 280.<br>
The operation staff of the plant 100 can<br>
access information stored in various databases provided<br>
in the control apparatus 200 by using an external input<br>
device 600 formed by a keyboard 601 and a mouse 602, a<br>
data processing apparatus 610 having a data<br>
send/receive part 612 which can send and receive data<br>
to/from the control apparatus 200, and a display 620.<br>
Moreover, the operation staff of the plant<br>
100 can use the aforementioned apparatuses to input<br>
setting parameters used in the numerical calculation<br>
part 200, the learning part 260, and the pattern<br>
generation part 400 which are provided in the control<br>
apparatus 200.<br>
The data processing apparatus 610 is formed<br>
by an external input interface 611, a data send/receive<br>
part 612, and an external output interface 613.<br>
The input signal 61 of the data processing<br>
apparatus generated in the external input apparatus 600<br>
is inputted to the data processing apparatus 610 via<br>
the external input interface 611.  The data<br>
send/receive part 612 of the data processing apparatus<br>
610 acquires the I/O data information 60 provided in<br>
the control apparatus 200 according to the information<br>
in the data processing apparatus input signal 62.<br>
Moreover, according to the information in the<br>
data processing apparatus input signal 62, the data<br><br>
send/receive part 612 outputs the I/O data information<br>
60 containing the parameter setting value used in the<br>
numerical calculation part 220, the learning part 260,<br>
and the pattern generation part 400 provided in the<br>
control apparatus 200.<br>
The data send/receive part 610 transmits data<br>
processing apparatus output signal 63 obtained by<br>
processing the I/O data information 60, to the external<br>
output interface 613.  A data processing apparatus<br>
output signal 64 is sent from the external output<br>
interface 613 to the display 620 and displayed.<br>
Accordingly, information stored in the respective<br>
databases provided in the control apparatus 200 can be<br>
displayed on the display 620.<br>
It should be noted that the plant control<br>
system 200 according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes the measurement signal database 210,<br>
the numerical calculation database 240, the operation<br>
signal database 250, the learning information database<br>
270, the control logic database 290, and the pattern<br>
database 500 which are arranged so as to constitute the<br>
calculation apparatus of the control apparatus 200.<br>
However, it is also possible to arrange all or some of<br>
them outside the control apparatus 200.<br>
Moreover, in the aforementioned example, the<br>
numerical calculation part 220 is built in the control<br>
apparatus 200.  However, it is also possible to arrange<br>
it outside the control apparatus 200.<br><br>
For example, it is also possible to arrange<br>
the numerical calculation part 220 and the numerical<br>
calculation database 240 outside the control apparatus<br>
200 and the numerical calculation result 6 is sent to<br>
the control apparatus 2 00 via the Internet.<br>
Next, the learning part 260 provided in the<br>
control apparatus 200 will be detailed with reference<br>
to Fig. 2..<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the learning part 2 60<br>
includes a model input generation part 2 61, a pre-<br>
learning part 262, a pattern selection part 263, a<br>
pattern transforming part 264, and a re-learning part<br>
2 65.<br>
The model input generation part 2 61<br>
constituting the learning part 260 applies an operation<br>
amount 19 to the current model input condition of the<br>
model 230 so as to generate the model input 7 and the<br>
state input 20 after the operation, by the model input<br>
generation part.<br>
Moreover, the state input 20 is extracted by<br>
using the model input generation part 2 61 from the<br>
measurement signal 3 of the plant 100 stored in the<br>
measurement signal database 210.<br>
The pre-learning part 262 constituting the<br>
learning part 260 uses the learning information data 9<br>
stored in the learning information database 270 before<br>
start of the operation of the plant 100, so as to learn<br>
the method for generating the model input 7 so that the<br><br>
model output 8 simulated/calculated by the model 230<br>
can achieve the model output target value.<br>
Here, the state input 20 is used as it is.<br>
The model input 7 is generated by applying the<br>
operation amount 19 learned by the pre-learning part<br>
2 62, to the current model input condition, inputs it to<br>
the model 230, and inputs it as the state input 20<br>
after the operation to the pre-learning part 262.<br>
The learning data 10 obtained as a result of<br>
the learning in the pre-learning part 262 is stored in<br>
the learning information database 270.<br>
According to the learning information 16<br>
stored in the learning information database 270, the<br>
pattern generation part 400 generates pattern data and<br>
stores the pattern data 17 generated by the pattern<br>
generation part 400, in the pattern database 500.<br>
The pattern selection part 263 constituting<br>
the learning part 260 selects the pattern data 23 from<br>
the pattern data 18 stored in the pattern database 500<br>
according to the state input 20 and supplies it to the<br>
pattern transforming part 264.<br>
The pattern transforming part 264<br>
constituting the learning part 250 patterns the pattern<br>
data 23 selected by the pattern selection part 263 and<br>
reduces the input dimension.<br>
Moreover, the pattern transforming part 264<br>
executes inverse operation on the operation amount 21<br>
learned by the patterning so as to increase the input<br><br>
dimension.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, explanation will be<br>
given on the patterning.  As shown in Fig. 3, the<br>
pattern transforming part 264 processes the pattern<br>
data as follows: the input information value to be used<br>
in the patterning is set to 1 and the input information<br>
value not to be used is set to 0.<br>
Accordingly, when patterning the state input<br>
20, only the input having the pattern data information<br>
value 1 for the state input 20 is selected.<br>
Moreover, in the inverse operation, linear<br>
interpolation is performed between the inputs used in<br>
the patterning for the operation amount 21 patterned<br>
after the learning so as to obtain an operation amount<br>
of other inputs.<br>
In Fig. 2, the re-learning part 265<br>
constituting the learning part 2 60 learns the<br>
generation method of the model input 7 after the<br>
operation of the plant is started,<br>
by using the learning information data 9 stored in the<br>
learning information database 270, so that the model<br>
output 8 to be simulated/calculated by the model 230<br>
corrected by the measurement signal 3 can achieve the<br>
model output target value.<br>
Here, the pattern transforming part 264<br>
patterns the state input 20.  The patterned state input<br>
22 is supplied to the re-learning part 265<br>
corresponding to the pattern.  As a result of learning<br><br>
in the re-learning part, a patterned operation amount<br>
21 is outputted from the re-learning part 265.<br>
The patterned operation amount is transformed<br>
again into the operation amount 19 by the pattern<br>
transforming part 2 64 and inputted to the model input<br>
generation part 2 61 so as to generate the model input 7<br>
and the state input 20 after the operation.<br>
With the configuration thus far explained,<br>
the learning part 260 realizes the pre-learning for the<br>
pattern generation before starting the operation of the<br>
plant and the re-learning by the patterning of the<br>
state input after the operation start of the plant 100.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing the operation<br>
of the control apparatus 200 for controlling a plant as<br>
the embodiment of the present invention explained with<br>
reference to Fig. 1 to Fig. 3.<br>
In the flowchart of Fig. 4, a combination of<br>
steps 1000, 1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, and 1050 is<br>
executed.  Hereinafter, explanation will be given on<br>
each of the steps.<br>
After start of the operation of the control<br>
apparatus 200 for controlling the plant 100, firstly,<br>
in step 1000, numerical calculation is executed by the<br>
numerical calculation part 220 of the control apparatus<br>
200 and the numerical calculation data 4 is sent to the<br>
numerical calculation database 240 so as to be stored<br>
in it.<br>
Next, in step 1010, the learning part 260 and<br><br>
the model 230 of the control apparatus 200 are used to<br>
execute pre-learning of the plant operation method and<br>
transmit the learning data 10 to the learning<br>
information database 270 so as to be stored in it.<br>
Next, in step 1020, the pattern generation<br>
part 400 of the control apparatus generates pattern<br>
data 17 by using the learning data 16 obtained by pre-<br>
learning stored in the learning information database<br>
270 and transmits the pattern data 17 to the pattern<br>
database 500 so as to be stored in it.  The<br>
aforementioned operation is executed before starting<br>
the operation of the plant 100.<br>
After the operation of the plant 100 is<br>
started, step 1030 inputs the measurement signal 1 of<br>
the plant 100 to the control apparatus 200 by using the<br>
external input interface 201 and transmits it to the<br>
measurement signal database 210 so as to be stored in<br>
it.<br>
Step 1040 patterns the state input extracted<br>
by the acquired measurement signal 3 by using the<br>
pattern database stored in the pattern database 500 and<br>
executes re-learning in the learning part 2 60.<br>
After the learning in the learning part 260,<br>
by using the learning result determination part 300 of<br>
the control apparatus 200, appropriate learning data 12<br>
is selected from the learning data 11 obtained by the<br>
used pattern is selected and outputted from the<br>
learning result determination part 300 to the operation<br><br>
signal generation part 280.<br>
In the subsequent step 1050, the operation<br>
signal generation part 280 generates an operation<br>
signal 14 by using the learning data 12 and the control<br>
logic data 13 and outputs it as the operation signal 15<br>
from the operation signal generation part 280 via the<br>
external input interface 202 to the plant 100.<br>
The aforementioned steps 1030 to 1050 are<br>
repeatedly executed each time a measurement signal is<br>
inputted, thereby controlling the plant 100.<br>
Next, the operations of the steps 1010, 1020,<br>
and 1040 in Fig. 4 will be detailed with reference to a<br>
flowchart.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flowchart showing the operation<br>
of the pre-learning of step 1010.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the flowchart of the pre-<br>
learning operation is executed by a combination of<br>
steps 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, 2060, 2070,<br>
and 2080.<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed explanation will be<br>
given on each of the steps.<br>
Step 2000 initializes (sets I=1) the number<br>
of initialization times I which indicates the number of<br>
repetitions of the steps 2010 to 2060.<br>
Next, step 2010 sets an initial value of the<br>
state input.  An arbitrary model input value can be<br>
selected as the initial value of the state input.<br>
Step 2020 initializes (sets J = 1) the number<br><br>
of operation times J indicating the number of operation<br>
times J indicating the number of repetitions of steps<br>
2030 to 2050.<br>
Next, step 2030 obtains an operation amount<br>
of the model input by using the pre-learning part 2 62<br>
of the learning part 260 constituting the control<br>
apparatus 2 00.<br>
Step 2040 adds the operation amount to the<br>
state input by using the model input generation part of<br>
the learning part 260 to operate the model 230 and<br>
update the state input.<br>
Step 2050 learns the operation method of the<br>
model 230 by using the neural network and various<br>
learning algorithms such as the reinforced learning<br>
according to the model output obtained as a result of<br>
the operation of the model 2230.<br>
Step 2060 is a branching section where the<br>
number of operation times J is compared to a<br>
predetermined threshold value.  If J is smaller than<br>
the threshold value, J is incremented by 1 and control<br>
is returned to step 2030.  If J is greater than the<br>
threshold value, control is passed to step 2070 which<br>
is a branching section.<br>
Step 2070 compares the number of<br>
initialization times I to the predetermined threshold<br>
value.  If I is smaller than the threshold value, I is<br>
incremented by 1 and control is returned to step 2010.<br>
If I is greater than the threshold value, control is<br><br>
passed to step 2080.<br>
Step 2080 transmits the learning result<br>
obtained by the learning part 2 60 to the learning<br>
information database 270 so as to be stored in it.<br>
Then, control is passed to step to terminate the pre-<br>
learning operation.<br>
By the aforementioned operation, the pre-<br>
learning starts learning by using an arbitrary model<br>
input as the initial value of the state input in step<br>
2010.  Accordingly, it is possible to acquire an<br>
operation method to reach the model output target value<br>
from an arbitrary model input condition.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the pattern<br>
generation of step 1020.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the flowchart of the<br>
pattern generation operation executes a combination of<br>
steps 4000, 4010, 4020, and 4030.<br>
Hereinafter, each of the steps will be<br>
detailed with reference to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8,<br>
Step 4000 initializes (sets I=1) the data<br>
reference number I as the value indicating the number<br>
of repetitions of the steps 4010 to 4020.<br>
Next, step 4010 references the learning data<br>
obtained by pre-learning stored in the learning<br>
information database 270 according to I so as to<br>
generate a pattern.  It should be noted that a detailed<br>
explanation will be given later on the pattern<br>
generation algorithm.<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows the learning data stored in the<br>
learning information database 270 of the control<br>
apparatus 2 00.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the learning information<br>
database 270 contains the state input value, the<br>
operation amount value in its state input, and the<br>
model output amount obtained as the result of the<br>
operation.<br>
A pattern is generated according to the<br>
operation amount in the learning data.  It should be<br>
noted that in Fig. 7, S_0001 is a number assigned for<br>
distinguishing the state input.<br>
Step 4020 in Fig. 6 transmits the generated<br>
pattern and the state input value of the referenced<br>
learning data to the pattern database 500 so as to be<br>
stored in it.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the learning data stored in the<br>
pattern database 500 of the control apparatus 200.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the pattern database 500<br>
contains the pattern data and the state input value<br>
referenced upon generation of the pattern.<br>
When storing the generated pattern, if the<br>
generated pattern coincides with the pattern data<br>
already stored, it is stored as the state input<br>
corresponding to the pattern data.<br>
Accordingly, there is a case that one pattern<br>
data is correlated to a plurality of state inputs.  It<br>
should be noted that in Fig. 8, P 0001 is a number<br><br>
assigned to distinguish pattern data.<br>
Step 4030 in Fig. 6 is a branching section<br>
where the data reference number I is compared to the<br>
predetermined threshold value.  I f J is smaller than<br>
the threshold value, J is incremented by 1 and control<br>
is returned to step 4010.  On the contrary, if J is<br>
equal to or greater than the threshold value, control<br>
is passed to the step to terminate the operation of the<br>
pattern generation.<br>
Next, a detailed explanation will be given on<br>
the pattern generation algorithm of step 4010 with<br>
reference to the flowchart of Fig. 9 and Fig. 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the pattern generation<br>
algorithm starts search from the pattern input<br>
dimension 1 in order to suppress the input dimension to<br>
be patterned to a minimum value and repeats the search<br>
to generate a pattern while increasing the input<br>
dimension until the end condition is satisfied.<br>
Moreover, in order to effectively perform the<br>
pattern search, the evolution search algorithm is used<br>
for the search.  That is, the pattern database<br>
expression is made to be a gene (solution candidate)<br>
and the generated solution candidates are subjected to<br>
genetic operations such as mixing and mutation so as to<br>
search for an optimal pattern.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the flowchart of step<br>
4010 is formed by a combination of steps 4011, 4012,<br>
4013, 4014, 4015, 4016, 4017, 4018, and 4019.<br><br>
Hereinafter, each of the steps will be<br>
detailed.<br>
Step 4011 initializes J (J = 1) as a value<br>
indicating the input dimension used for patterning.<br>
Step 4012 initializes the number of<br>
generations K (set K =1) as a value indicating the<br>
number of repetitions of steps 4010 to 4015.<br>
Next, step 4013 generates L solution<br>
candidates under the constriction condition that J is<br>
the input dimension which makes the pattern data<br>
information value.<br>
Step 4014 calculates a patterning error for<br>
each of the solution candidates.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the patterning error is<br>
calculated as an operation amount obtained by linearly<br>
interpolating the operation amount of the learning data<br>
to be referenced and the input used in patterning.<br>
Step 4015 performs genetic operations such as<br>
crossover and mutation on the solution candidates under<br>
the constriction condition according to the calculated<br>
patterning error so as to generate a new solution<br>
candidate.<br>
Step 4016 is a branching section .  If the<br>
number of generations K is equal to or smaller than a<br>
predetermined threshold value, K is incremented by 1<br>
and control is returned to step 4010.  Otherwise,<br>
control is passed to step 4017.<br>
Step 4017 selects a solution candidate which<br><br>
makes the patterning error to be minimum for the<br>
solution candidate group which has passed through the<br>
predetermined number of generations and control is<br>
passed to step 4018.<br>
Step 4018 is a branching section.  If the<br>
patterning error of the solution candidate selected in<br>
step 4017 is equal to or greater than a predetermined<br>
threshold value, or the input dimension J is equal to<br>
or smaller than a predetermined threshold value, J is<br>
incremented by 1 and control is returned to step 4012.<br>
Otherwise, control is passed to step 4019.<br>
Step 4019 uses the selected solution<br>
candidate as a generation pattern and transmits it to<br>
the pattern database 500 so as to be stored in it.<br>
Control is passed to the step to terminate the<br>
operation of the pattern generation algorithm.<br>
With the aforementioned operation, the<br>
generated pattern data is stored in the pattern<br>
database 500.<br>
The operation staff of the plant 100 uses the<br>
delta processing apparatus 610 to display these<br>
information on the display 620.<br>
Thus, the operation staff can know what kind<br>
of state input can be currently used for patterning.<br>
Moreover,, the operation staff can input threshold<br>
values J and K as the setting parameters via the<br>
display 620.<br>
Fig. 11 is a flowchart showing the re-<br><br>
learning operation of step 1040.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the flowchart of the re-<br>
learning operation is formed by a combination of steps<br>
2100, 2110, 2120, 2130, 2140, 2150, 2160, 2170, and<br>
2180.<br>
Hereinafter, each of the steps will be<br>
detailed.<br>
Step 2100 extracts the state input to be<br>
inputted to the re-learning part 2 65 from the<br>
measurement signal by using the model input generation<br>
part 261 of the learning part 260 constituting the<br>
control apparatus 260.<br>
Next, step 2110 uses the pattern selection<br>
part 263 of the learning part 260 to calculate the<br>
minimum state input error between the extracted state<br>
input and the pattern data stored in the pattern<br>
database 500 of the control apparatus 200.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the pattern database 500<br>
contains a plurality of state input values for each of<br>
patterns and the minimum state input error is a minimum<br>
difference between these values and the current state<br>
input value.<br>
The minimum state input error is the<br>
similarity between the current state input and the<br>
state input experienced in the pre-learning.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to select a pattern<br>
corresponding to the state input having a high<br>
similarity with the current state input value according<br><br>
to the minimum state input error.<br>
As a result, by using the selected pattern,<br>
it is possible to learn the operation amount which can<br>
obtain the control effect equivalent to the pre-<br>
learning result for the current state input.<br>
Step 2120 is a branching section to decide<br>
whether any of the pattern minimum state input errors<br>
calculated in step 2110 is equal to or smaller than the<br>
predetermined threshold value.  If yes, control is<br>
passed to step 2130.  Otherwise, control is passed to<br>
step 2140.<br>
Step 2130 selects all the patterns having the<br>
minimum state input error equal to or smaller than the<br>
threshold value and then control is passed to step<br>
2150.<br>
Step 2140 selects only the pattern having the<br>
smallest minimum state input error and control is<br>
passed to step 2150.<br>
Next, step 2150 initializes (set 1=1) the I<br>
as the value indicating the number of repetitions of<br>
the steps 2160.<br>
Step 2160 learns the model operation method<br>
of the model 230 by using the re-learning part 265 of<br>
the learning part 260 corresponding to the selected<br>
pattern.<br>
Step 2170 is a branching section.  If I is<br>
equal to or smaller than the selected number of<br>
patterns, I is incremented by 1 and control is returned<br><br>
to step 2160 and learning is performed by using the re-<br>
learning part 2 65 corresponding to the another selected<br>
pattern.<br>
Step 2180 decides the appropriate operation<br>
method among the re-learning results obtained by the<br>
selected pattern by using the learning result<br>
determination part 300 of the control apparatus 200 and<br>
outputs it to the operation signal generation part 280<br>
of the control apparatus 200.  Then, control is passed<br>
to the step to terminate the operation of re-learning.<br>
With the aforementioned operation, re-<br>
learning can learn the operation method equivalent to<br>
the pre-learning result in a short time by using the<br>
pattern selected according to the pre-learning result<br>
for the current state input.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to input the<br>
threshold value of the minimum state input error as the<br>
set parameter via the display 620.<br>
Next, a detailed explanation will be given on<br>
the re-learning algorithm of step 2160 with reference<br>
to the flowchart of Fig. 12.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the flowchart of the<br>
operation of the re-learning algorithm is executed by a<br>
combination of steps 2200, 2210, 2220, 2230, 2240,<br>
2250, 2260, 2270, 2280, 2290, and 2300.<br>
Hereinafter, each of the steps will be<br>
detailed.<br>
Step 2200 initializes (set J = 1) the number<br><br>
of initializations J as a value indicating the number<br>
of repetitions of steps 2210 to 2280.<br>
Next, step 2210 initializes the state input<br>
to an input value to be extracted from the measurement<br>
signal 3.<br>
Step 2220 initializes (K = 1) the number of<br>
repetitions K as a value indicating the number of<br>
repetitions of steps 2230 to 2270.<br>
Next, step 2230 obtains the operation amount<br>
of the patterned model input by using re-learning part<br>
265 of the learning part 260 corresponding to the<br>
pattern to be used.<br>
Step 2240 linearly interpolates the operation<br>
amount of the patterned model input by using the<br>
pattern transforming part 264 of the learning part 260<br>
so as to obtain the operation amount.<br>
Step 2250 adds the operation amount to the<br>
state input by using the model input generation part<br>
261 of the learning part 260 so as to operate the model<br>
and update the state input.<br>
Step 2260 patterns the state input according<br>
to the pattern data to be used, by using the pattern<br>
transforming part 264 of the learning part 260.<br>
Step 2270 learns the model operation method<br>
by using the neural network and various learning<br>
algorithms such as reinforced learning according to the<br>
model output obtained as a result of the model<br>
operation.<br><br>
Step 2280 is a branching section where the<br>
number of operations K is compared to a predetermined<br>
threshold value.  If K is smaller than the threshold<br>
value, K is incremented by 1 and control is returned to<br>
step 2230.  Otherwise, control is passed to step 2290.<br>
Step 2290 compares the number of<br>
initializations J to a predetermined threshold value.<br>
If J is smaller than the threshold value, J is<br>
incremented by 1 and control is returned to step 2210.<br>
Otherwise,, control is passed to step 2300.<br>
Step 2300 transmits the learned result to the<br>
learning information database 270 of the control<br>
apparatus 200 so as to be stored in it and control is<br>
passed to the step to terminate the operation of re-<br>
learning.<br>
With the aforementioned operation, the re-<br>
learning uses the patterned state input to learn the<br>
operation method when the current state input is used<br>
as the initial value.<br>
This completes the detailed explanation of<br>
the operations of the steps 1010, 1020, and 1040 shown<br>
in Fig. 4.<br>

start calculation by the numerical calculation<br>
execution part 220.  Moreover, when the button 713<br>
"return" is selected, control is passed to Fig. 13.<br>
On the screen of the display 620 shown in<br>
Fig. 15, it is possible to select a database containing<br><br>
information to be displayed.<br>
By selecting the button 721 of "measurement<br>
signal database", the button 722 of "operation signal<br>
database", the button 723 of "numerical calculation<br>
database", the button 724 of "learning information<br>

It is possible to display the information in<br>
the respective databases on the display 62 0 and add new<br>
information to the information in the database and to<br>
modify or delete information in the database.<br>
Moreover, by selecting the button 727 of "return", the<br>
screen is returned to Fig. 13.<br>
On the screen of Fig. 16, when the button 731<br>
of "pre-learning" is selected, the pre-learning screen<br>
shown in Fig. 18 appears.<br>
Moreover, when the button 732 of "re-<br>
learning" is selected on the screen of Fig. 16, the re-<br>
learning screen shown in Fig. 19 appears on the display<br>
620.  When the button 733 of "return" is selected, the<br>
screen of Fig. 13 appears.<br>
The screen of Fig. 17 shows the model input<br>
741 before operation, the model output 742, the model<br><br>
input 743 after the operation, model output 744, and<br>
the learned operation amount 745 as a guidance display,<br>
so that the plant operation staff can select whether to<br>
execute an operation on the guidance display.<br>
When an operation is to be executed, the<br>
button 746 of "yes" is selected.  Otherwise, the button<br>
747 of "no" is selected.<br>
On the display screen shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
operation staff can confirm the relationship between<br>
the pattern and the operation signal before operating<br>
the plant, which increases the reliability of the plant<br>
operation..<br>
That is, the plant control method shown in<br>
Fig. 17 can be detailed as follows.  In the plant<br>
control method of the control apparatus for controlling<br>
the plant by using a model simulating the plant, as<br>
shown in Fig. 8, the control apparatus has a pattern<br>
database containing the state input pattern which<br>
patterns a plurality of operation signals to be<br>
inputted to the model.  Moreover, as shown in Fig. 7,<br>
the control apparatus includes a learning information<br>
database containing a plurality of operation signals to<br>
be inputted to the model and the output from the model.<br>
As shown as the model input 743 and the model output<br>
744 after the operation, the plurality of operation<br>
signals stored in the learning information database and<br>
the output from the model are outputted to the display.<br>
As shown as the learned operation amount 745, the<br><br>
operation signal to the plant according to the<br>
plurality of operation signals inputted to the model<br>
and the state input pattern stored in the pattern<br>
database are superimposed and outputted to the display.<br>
As shown as the button 74 6 to be selected when an<br>
operation is to be executed, the plant is controlled by<br>
the operation signal to the plant according to<br>
permission of operation on the plant.<br>
In Fig. 18, when the button 751 of "learning<br>
start" is selected, the pre-learning part 262 of the<br>
learning part 260 and the model 230 of the control<br>
apparatus 200 are operated according to the flowchart<br>
shown in Fig. 5 so as to execute the pre-learning of<br>
the operation method.<br>
Moreover, when the button 742 of "pattern<br>
generation" is selected the pattern generation screen<br>
shown in Fig. 20 appears on the display 620.<br>
When the button 753 of "return" is selected,<br>
control is returned to Fig. 16.<br>
In Fig. 19, it is possible to input the set<br>
value of the minimum state input error threshold value<br>
to be used in the flowchart of Fig. 11, into the data<br>
input column 761.<br>
After the set value is inputted in the data<br>
input column 7 61, if the button 7 62 "execution" is<br>
selected, the learning part 260 of the control<br>
apparatus 200 and the model 230 are operated according<br>
to the flowchart shown in Fig. 11 so as to execute re-<br><br>
learning.<br>
Moreover, if the button 763 of "return" is<br>
selected, control is returned to Fig. 16.<br>
In Fig. 20, it is possible to input a set<br>
value of the patterning error threshold value used in<br>
the flowchart shown in Fig. 9 into the data input<br>
column 771, and the set value of the pattern input<br>
dimension threshold value into the data input column<br>
772.<br>
If the button 773 of "execution" is selected<br>
after the setting values are inputted into the data<br>
input columns 771 and 772, the pattern generation part<br>
400 of the control apparatus 200 is operated according<br>
to the flowchart shown in Fig. 6 so as to execute<br>
pattern generation.<br>
Moreover, if the button 774 of "return" is<br>
selected, control is returned to Fig. 18.<br>
This completes the explanation on the screens<br>
displayed on the display 620.<br>
As has been described above with reference to<br>
the flowcharts in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, in the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the state input<br>
inputted to the learning part of the plant control<br>
system is patterned with a smaller number of inputs<br>
than the model input dimension so as to reduce the<br>
model search space, thereby enabling a high-speed<br>
learning.<br>
Moreover, a desired learning result can<br><br>
always be obtained by generating a pattern by using a<br>
pre-learning result without reducing the input<br>
dimension in advance before start of the plant<br>
operation as has been detailed with reference to the<br>
flowchart in Fig. 5, and comparing the similarity of<br>
the current state input to the state input contained in<br>
the pre-learning result after start of the plant<br>
operation so that a pattern generated from the state<br>
input having a higher similarity is selected for<br>
learning the operation method as has been detailed with<br>
reference to the flowchart of Fig. 11.<br>
Moreover, as has been detailed with reference<br>
to the flowchart of Fig. 9, it is possible to<br>
automatically generate a pattern input dimension and<br>
pattern information by an evolutionary search<br>
algorithm., which enables pattern generation not<br>
requiring any manual operation while preventing an<br>
erroneous patterning.<br>
Furthermore, the plant operation staff can<br>
visually check the state of the patterning and the<br>
effect of the patterned learning because the apparatus<br>
has the function to reference the information stored in<br>
the respective databases on the display and the<br>
function to input setting parameters to be used in the<br>
learning part and the pattern generation part via the<br>
display as has been detailed with reference to Fig. 13<br>
to Fig. 20.<br>
Next, explanation will be given on a case<br><br>
that the plant control system 200 as the embodiment of<br>
the present invention shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 20 is<br>
applied to a thermal power plant 100 having a boiler.<br>
It should be noted that the plant control system 200<br>
may be used for control of other plants than the<br>
thermal power plant.<br>
Fig. 21 shows an outline of the thermal power<br>
plant having a boiler.  Firstly, explanation will be<br>
given on the mechanism of the thermal power plant<br>
having the boiler.<br>
In the thermal power plant shown in Fig. 21,<br>
coal as fuel is crushed into fine coal powder by a mill<br>
110 and introduced via a burner 102 into a boiler 101<br>
together v/ith a primary air for feed of the coal powder<br>
and a secondary air for combustion adjustment.  The<br>
coal as the fuel burns in a furnace of the boiler 101.<br>
The coal as the fuel and the primary air are<br>
introduced via a pipe 134 while the secondary air is<br>
introduced via a pipe 141 into the burner 102.<br>
Moreover, the after-air for two-stage<br>
combustion is introduced into the boiler 101 via an<br>
after-air port 103 installed in the boiler 101.  The<br>
after-air is introduced into the after-air port 103<br>
from a pipe 142.<br>
The high-temperature combustion gas generated<br>
by combustion of the fuel coal inside the furnace of<br>
the boiler flows downward along a route shown by arrows<br>
in the furnace of the boiler 101 and passes through a<br><br>
heat exchanger 106.  After the heat exchange, the<br>
combustion exhaust gas is discharged from the boiler<br>
101 and flows downward toward an air heater 104<br>
installed outside the boiler 101.<br>
The combustion exhaust gas which has passed<br>
through the air heater 104 comes into an exhaust gas<br>
treating device (not depicted).  After harmful<br>
substances are removed from the combustion exhaust gas,<br>
the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere<br>
through a chimney.<br>
Water circulating in the boiler 101 is<br>
introduced from a condenser (not depicted) installed in<br>
a turbine 108 into the boiler 101 via a water feed pump<br>
105.  The water is heated in the heat exchanger 106 by<br>
the combustion gas flowing downward in the furnace of<br>
the boiler 101 and becomes vapor of a high temperature.<br>
It should be noted that in this embodiment,<br>
only one heat exchanger is depicted.  However, it is<br>
also possible to arrange a plurality of heat<br>
exchangers.<br>
The vapor of a high temperature and a high<br>
pressure generated in the heat exchanger 106 is<br>
introduced via a turbine governor valve 107 to the<br>
vapor turbine 108 so that energy of the vapor drives<br>
the vapor turbine 108 to rotate a generator 109 coupled<br>
to the vapor turbine 108 and generate electricity.<br>
Next, explanation will be given on routes of<br>
the primary air and the secondary air introduced into<br><br>
the furnace of the boiler 101 from the burner 102<br>
installed in the furnace of the boiler 101 and the<br>
route of the after-air introduced into the furnace of<br>
the boiler 101 from the after-air port 103 installed in<br>
the furnace of the boiler 101.<br>
The primary air is introduced from a fan 120<br>
into a pipe 130 which is branched to a pipe 132 which<br>
passes through the air heater 104 and a pipe 131 which<br>
bypasses the pipe 132 and the air heater 104.  The<br>
primary air which has flown downward through the pipes<br>
132 and 131 is again mixed in a pipe 133 and introduced<br>
into the mill 110.<br>
The air which passes through the air heater<br>
104 is heated by the combustion exhaust gas discharged<br>
from the furnace of the boiler 101.<br>
The coal (fine coal powder) generated in the<br>
mill 110 by using the primary air is fed through the<br>
pipe 133 to the burner 102.<br>
The secondary air and the after-air are<br>
introduced from a fan 121 into a pipe 140 and flows<br>
downward in the pipe 140 which passes through the air<br>
heater 104, so as to be heated.  After the heating, the<br>
pipe 140 is branched into a pipe 141 for the secondary<br>
air and a pipe 142 for the after-air, which are<br>
respectively introduced to the burner 102 and the<br>
after-air port 103 installed in the furnace of the<br>
boiler 101.<br>
The control apparatus 200 for the thermal<br><br>
power plant 100 having the boiler according to the<br>
present embodiment has the function to adjust the air<br>
amount to be introduced from the burner 102 into the<br>
boiler 101 and the air amount to be introduced from the<br>
after-air port 103 into the boiler 101 so as to reduce<br>
the NOx and CO concentrations in the exhaust gas from<br>
the boiler.<br>
The thermal power plant 100 includes various<br>
measurement devices for detecting the operation state<br>
of the thermal power plant.  A measurement signal<br>
obtained from the measurement devices is sent as a<br>
measurement signal 1 to the control apparatus 200.<br>
The measurement devices for detecting the<br>
operation state of the thermal power plant 100 may be,<br>
for example, a flowmeter 150, a thermometer 151, a<br>
pressure indicator 152, a generated electricity<br>
measuring device 153, and a concentration measuring<br>
device 154 for measuring O2 concentration and/or CO<br>
concentration as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The flowmeter 150 measures the flow rate of<br>
water supplied from a water feed pump 105 to the boiler<br>
101.  Moreover, the thermometer 151 and the pressure<br>
indicator 152 respectively measure the temperature and<br>
the pressure of the vapor generated by the heat<br>
exchange with the combustion gas flowing downward in<br>
the boiler 101 in the heat exchanger 106 in the boiler<br>
101 and supplied to the vapor turbine 108.<br>
The generated electricity measuring device<br><br>
153 measures the electricity generated by a generator<br>
109 rotated by the vapor turbine 108 which is driven by<br>
the vapor generated by the heat exchanger 106.<br>
Moreover, information on the concentrations<br>
of the components (such as CO and NOx) contained in the<br>
combustion gas flowing downward in the boiler 101 is<br>
measured by the concentration measuring device 154<br>
arranged at the exit of the boiler at the downstream<br>
side of the boiler 101 so as to measure the O2<br>
concentration and/or the CO concentration.<br>
It should be noted that a plenty of other<br>
measuring devices than those shown in Fig. 2 are<br>
arranged on the thermal power plant 100 but they are<br>
not depicted.<br>
Fig. 22 is a partial enlarged diagram showing<br>
the air heater 104 arranged at the downstream side of<br>
the boiler 101 constituting the thermal power plant 100<br>
and the pipes arranged in the air heater 104.<br>
As shown in Fig. 22, air dampers 162, 163,<br>
161, 160 are respectively arranged in a pipe 131 which<br>
bypasses the secondary air pipe 132, the after-air pipe<br>
142, the pipe 132 arranged inside the air heater 104,<br>
and the air heater 104 which are branched at the<br>
downstream side of the pipe 140 arranged inside the air<br>
heater 104.<br>
By operating the air dampers 160 to 163, it<br>
is possible to change the area where the air passes<br>
inside the pipes 131, 132, 141, 142 so as to separately<br><br>
adjust the air flow rate in the pipes 132, 132, 141,<br>
and 142.<br>
By using the operation signal 15 outputted to<br>
the thermal power plant 100 by the control apparatus<br>
200 which controls the thermal power plant 100, it is<br>
possible to operate the water feed pump 105, the mill<br>
110, the air dampers 160, 161, 162, 163, and other<br>
devices.<br>
It should be noted that in the control<br>
apparatus 200 for the thermal power plant 100 according<br>
to the embodiment, devices for adjusting the state<br>
amount of the thermal power plant such as the water<br>
feed pump 105, the mill 110, the air dampers 160, 161,<br>
162, 163 are called operation ends and instruction<br>
signals required for operating them are called<br>
operation signals.<br>
Fig. 23 is a flowchart showing the process of<br>
the thermal power plant control method in the control<br>
apparatus 200 of the thermal power plant 100 having the<br>
boiler in the embodiment of the present invention shown<br>
in Fig. 21.<br>
In Fig. 23, the control apparatus 200 for the<br>
thermal plant 100 having the boiler in the embodiment<br>
executes control of the thermal power plant 100 by<br>
combining the steps 2181 and 2182.<br>
Step 2181 references the learning data<br>
obtained by each of the patterns selected by the<br>
pattern selection part 263 constituting the learning<br><br>
part 260 of the control apparatus 200 which controls<br>
the thermal power plant 100, compares the total of<br>
improvement values of the CO and NOx as the model<br>
output amount after the operation for current state<br>
input, and selects the maximum total of the improvement<br>
values.<br>
Moreover, when the number of patterns<br>
selected by the pattern selection part 263 is 1,<br>
control is passed to step 2182 without performing the<br>
aforementioned process.<br>
Step 2182 transmits the learning data 12 of<br>
the pattern selected by the pattern selection part 263<br>
to the operation signal generation part 280 and passes<br>
control to step to terminate the operation of the<br>
learning result determination part 300 constituting the<br>
control apparatus 200.<br>
With the aforementioned operation, the<br>
control apparatus 200 uses the learning data to obtain<br>
the best improvement values of CO and COx as the result<br>
of re-learning so as to generate an operation signal.<br>
Fig. 24 shows an example of the screen<br>
displayed on the display 620 in the control apparatus<br>
2 00 of the thermal power plant 100 having the boiler<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 24 shows an example of screen which<br>
shows the air amount of the burner 102 of the boiler<br>
101 used as the model input 7 inputted to the model 230<br>
constituting the control apparatus 200, the air amount<br><br>
of the air port 103, guidance display of the<br>
concentrations of CO, NOx used in the model output 8 by<br>
simulation-calculating the thermal power plant to be<br>
controlled by the model 230 before and after the<br>
operation, and the operation amounts of the burner 102,<br>
and the air port 103 learned by the learning part 265<br>
by the patterning of the pattern transforming part 264.<br>
The model input 7 displays distribution of the air<br>
amount of the burner 102/air port 103 arranged before<br>
and after a tank of the boiler 101 while correlating<br>
them with the boiler structure diagram.<br>
It should be noted that in Fig. 25, the<br>
burner 102 and the air port 103 are arranged before and<br>
after the tank of the boiler 101 respectively as one<br>
stage each having five air entrances.  However, the<br>
numbers can be modified to an arbitrary value.<br>
The operation staff of the plant can check<br>
the control effect obtained by the patterned operation<br>
amount and the learned operation method to decide<br>
presence/absence of the operation while watching the<br>
screen shown in Fig. 24.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Figs. 25A to 25C,<br>
patterning in the control apparatus 200 for the thermal<br>
power plant 100 having the boiler according to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention may be realized,<br>
for example, as (1) grouping of the operation ends for<br>
each of the burner 102 and the air port 103 of the<br>
boiler 101 (Fig. 25A) , (2) grouping of the operation<br><br>
ends before/after the tank of the boiler 101 (Fig.<br>
25B), and (3) grouping of all the operation ends of the<br>
boiler 101 (Fig. 25C).<br>
As is clear from the aforementioned, the<br>
operation staff of the thermal power plant 100 having<br>
the boiler can control the thermal power plant by<br>
selecting the appropriate patterning method by<br>
considering the type of the operation end, the number<br>
of operation ends, and the combustion characteristic of<br>
the boiler of the thermal power plant to be controlled.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention,, it is possible to provide a plant control<br>
system, which corrects the model according to the<br>
measurement signal which has measured the operation<br>
state of the plant, executes the high-speed learning so<br>
as to perform re-learning by using the corrected model<br>
and correct the plant control algorithm, thereby<br>
accurately control the plant.<br>
The present invention can be applied to a<br>
plant control system and in particular, to a control<br>
apparatus for a thermal power plant.<br>
It should be further understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that although the foregoing<br>
