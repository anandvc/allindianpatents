				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention particularly relates to Folding Lampshade with hard pleated cover wherein the shade frame and the pleated shade cover lend itself to be assembled in quick, easy and convenient way for table lamps and like, thus savings in time of manufacturing &amp; assembly, packing, transportation &amp; storage.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, the present art known for Folding Lampshade has a flexible shade cover and has too many members which have to be individually fixed in respective positions for erecting the shade frame. Further the top lampholder frame often has to be locked in vertical position. Thus these lampshade assembly with the present state of the art are time consuming, not convenient for pleated shades and also not cost effective.<br>
3.	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above described problems it is an objective of the present invention to provide a Folding Lampshade which has been simplified wherein when the top ring is lifted, three out of four inclined supporting members are positioned in their respective fixing positions, on alignment of the top lampholder frame in vertical position. After fixing the two inclined compression members attached to the top lampholder frame, in the holding bushes of the bottom ring, the fourth inclined tension member is hooked to the top ring against tension of another tension member, thus providing rigidity to the assembled frame. At the same time the top lampholder frame takes vertical position without having to be locked separately. Thus the erection of the frame becomes easier and faster on which the pleated cover can be mounted easily as described hereinafter.<br><br>
A Folding Lampshade comprising top ring and bottom ring characterized in that the top ring is linked with the bottom ring through two compression members integral with the lampholder frame and two tension members; the compression members are provided with hinges; the two compression member get fixed in two bushes which in turn are fixed on the bottom ring and one of the tension member is hinged at both end and the other tension member is hinged at one end with the bottom ring and hooked with top ring under tension: the pleated shade gets hooked to the top ring though the cut slot of the shade cover and rests on the bottom ring.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The abo\e objective and advantages of the present invention will become more<br>
apparent by describing in detail preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the<br>
attached drawings in which reference numerals indicate corresponding parts in the<br>
figure.<br>
The invention is illustrated with the diagrams as follows:<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram schematically illustrating the folding lampshade in assembled<br>
condition.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating the folding lampshade in folding state.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram schematically illustrating the various stages of assembling the shade frame.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram schematically illustrating the assembly of the pleated shade cover onto the frame.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:<br>
Now. a folding lampholder according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and according to the method will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the top ring (a) is linked with the bottom ring (h) through two compression members (c) which are integral with the lampholder frame (f). In the assembled state, these two compression members (c) get fixed in two bushes (g), which in turn are fixed on the bottom ring (h). The top ring (a) is also connected to the bottom ring (h) through tension member (d) which is hinged at both ends with the top and bottom rings; the other tension member (e) is hinged at one end with the bottom ring (h) and hooked with top ring (a) under tension. The lampholder frame (f) is fitted to the top ring (a) through two hinges (b).<br>
In the assembly process the following steps are taken as shown in Fig.3<br>
1)	First the top ring (a) is pulled up. making its top plane parallel to the bottom ring (h).<br>
2)	Holding the top ring (a), the lampholder frame (f) is pulled down to vertical position and in the process both the compression members (c) get aligned with the vertical plane and the ends of the compression members come closer to the anchoring bushes (g).<br>
3)	The compression members (c) are then anchored to the bushes (g) fitted on the bottom ring (h). When the compression members (c) are anchored to the bushes (g), the lampholder frame (f) gets locked in the vertical position as shown in fig. 3 a &amp;3b.<br>
4)	Then against the tension of the member (d), the other tension member (e) is hooked to the top ring (a), thus making the assembly of the lampshade frame complete.<br>
On assembly of the frame, the top ring (a) provides four equal segments for engagement with the pleated lampshade cover as shown in fig.3c.<br>
5)	For fixing the lampshade cover, as shown in Fig 4(i), the pleated cover is divided<br>
into four equal parts and then the cut end of the pleated cover is inserted on the four<br><br>
segment of the top ring (a). Now as shown in Fig.4 (ii), holding the lampshade frame with one hand and the pleated cover with the other hand, the pleated cover is pushed downward thus bringing the right sight of the cover on top as shown in Fig4 (iii). In this position the pleated shade gets hooked to the top ring though the cut slot of the shade and rests on the bottom ring.<br>
For dismantling the lampshade, the above steps are followed in reverse order. The Lampshade frame lends itself to be folded almost within the space of the bottom ring, with packing height limited to the height of the lampholder frame's ring (f) height as shown in Fig. 2<br>
While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A Folding Lampshade comprising top ring and bottom ring characterized in that<br>
the top ring is linked with the bottom ring through two compression members integral with the lampholder frame and two tension members:<br>
the compression members are provided with hinges;<br>
the two compression member get fixed on two bushes which in turn are fixed on the bottom ring and one of the tension member is hinged at both end and the other tension member is hinged at one end with the bottom ring and hooked with top ring under tension:<br>
the pleated shade gets hooked to the top ring though the cut slot of the shade cover and rests on the bottom ring.<br>
2.	A Folding Lampshade as claimed in claim 1 wherein top ring can be pulled up. making its top plane parallel to the bottom ring.<br>
3.	A Folding Lampshade as claimed in claim 1 wherein top ring is held and the lampholder frame is pulled down to vertical position and both the compression members get aligned with the vertical plane and the ends of the compression members come closer to the anchoring bushes.<br>
4.	A Folding Lampshade as claimed in claim 1 wherein the compression members are anchored to the bushes fitted on the bottom ring and when the compression members are anchored to the bushes the lampholder frame gets locked in the vertical position.<br>
