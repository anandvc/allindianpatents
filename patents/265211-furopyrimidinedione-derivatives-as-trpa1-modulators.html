Technical Field<br>
The present patent application relates to  furopyrimidinedione derivatives as TRPA1 modulators with transient receptor potential ankyrinl (TRPA1) activity.<br>
Background of the Invention The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels or receptors are pain receptors. They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTM1) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPC1 (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPA1 is most closely related to TRPV3 and is more closely related to TRPV1 and TRPV2 than to TRPV5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPM 1 (melastatin or LTRPC1), TRPM3 (KIAA1616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMR1), TRPM5 (MTR1 or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPML1 (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPP1 (PKD1, PCI), PKD-REJ and PKD-1L1 are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTM1.<br><br>
It is believed TRPAI is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAI is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice. TRPA1 is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17Â°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson, L. J. et al., Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAI ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAI receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAI is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals.<br>
The difference between TRPAI and other TRP receptors is that TRPAI ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required.<br>
WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions.<br>
In efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPA1.<br>

The terms "halogen" or "halo'" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The term "alky!" refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing no unsaturation, having from one to eight carbon atoms, and which is attached to the rest of the molecule by a single bond. e.g.. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 1-methylethyl (isopropyl), n-butyl, n-pentyl and 1,1-dimethylethyl (tert-butyl). The term "C1-6 alkyl" refers to an alkyl chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Unless set forth or recited to the contrary, all alkyl groups described herein may be straight chain or branched, substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
The term "alkenyl" refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing a carbon-carbon double bond and which may be a straight or branched chain having 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, e.g., ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (allyl), iso-propenyl. 2-methyl-l-propenyl. 1-butenyl and 2-butenyl.

The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPA1 is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 112, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N, Cell, 2006, 124, 1123-1125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1169-1181: Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004. 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein.<br>
Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett &amp; F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed, 1996, 100-107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as "nociceptors". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and A5 fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH
Chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral Or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or<br><br>
throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).<br>

A general approach for the synthesis of furopyrimidinyl acetamides of the general<br>
formula (I), wherein Z1, Z2, R1, R2, R3, U, V and L are as defined above in description is<br>
described in .-scheme 1. Coupling reaction of the compounds of the formula (1) (wherein R<br>
is hydrogen or alkyl) with amines of the formula (2) in the presence of a suitable coupling<br>
agent such as I-ethyI-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and<br>
base in suitable solvent gives compounds of the formula (3). The selective N-alkylation of<br>
the compounds of the formula (3) where X is halogen, with suitable alkylating agent of<br>
the formula (4) in the presence of base in a suitable solvent gives compound of the<br>
general formula (I).<br><br><br>
A general approach for the synthesis of furo[2.3-d]pyrimidinyl acetamides of<br>
formula (la) wherein Ra is hydrogen and U, V, R1 and R2 are as defined above is as<br>
shown is scheme 2. Coupling reaction of 1,3-dialkylbarbituric acid derivative of the<br>
formula (5) with chloroacetyl chloride derivative (6) in the presence of a suitable base<br>
like sodium hydride and in a suitable solvent like THF gives 5-(chloroacetyl)-6-hydroxy-<br>
l,3-dialkylpyrimidine-2,4(lH3H)-dione as an intermediate which on cyclisation in the<br>
presence of triethyfamine gives furo[2,3-d]pyrimidinetrione of formula (7). A similar<br>
approach is described by Strekowski, L. et al in ./. Heterocyclic Chem. 2001, 38, 359-<br>
363. Furo[2,3-d]pyrimidinetrione compounds of formula (7) was converted into furo[2,3-<br>
d]pyrimidinedione ester of compounds of general formula (8) by reaction with the<br>
lithium   salt   of  ethyl   acetate   (generated   from   dry   ethyl   acetate   and   Lithium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide [LHMDS]) followed by dehydration and isomerization under<br>
acidic conditions.  Direct coupling of compounds of the general  formula (8) with<br>
appropriate amines of formula (2) by using suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in<br>
suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, tetrahydrofuran) gives compounds of the general formula<br>
(la). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (la) can be prepared in two steps<br>
by hydrolysis of (8) under basic conditions to give the carboxylic acid (9) followed by<br>
coupling with amine of the general formula (2) using a suitable coupling agents [e.g., N-<br>
ethy]-N'-(3-dimethyLaminopropyL) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDO), benzotriazol-]-<br>
yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP] in suitable solvent<br>
or mixture of solvents (e.g., N,N-dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane<br>
etc. to give/compound of the general formula (la).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the carboxylic acid intermediate of the general formula (9) can be prepared as described in scheme 3, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above. Thus, reaction of cyanomethyl lithium with furo[2,3-d]pyrimidinetrione of formula (7) (where Ra is hydrogen or alkyl) in a suitable solvent gives furo[2.3-d]pyrimidinyl acetonitrile of the formula (10). This intermediate on hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives intermediate of the formula (9) required for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (Ta).<br>
Furo[2.3-d]pyrimidinedione ester of the formula (8a) where Ra is hydrogen or alkyl can also be prepared through a Wittig reaction on intermediate (7) as shown in scheme 4; wherein R and R are as defined above. Thus, reaction of intermediate (7) with trimethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide or n-butyl lithium in suitable solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide) gives ester of the formula (11). The ester (II) is then isomerized under acidic conditions to give intermediates of the formula (8a) useful for the preparation of compounds of the present invention represented by the formula (la).<br><br>
Another approach for the preparation of intermediates of the general formula (8b) is given in scheme 5, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above. Thus. Reformatsky reaction on intermediate (7) (where Ra is hydrogen or alkyl) by using BrZnCH2OO2R where R is alkyl (prepared from Zn and BrCH2CO2R) followed by in-situ dehydration of the carbinol intermediate gives intermediate (12). Double bond isomerization of intermediate (12) under acidic conditions gives the ester intermediate (8b).<br><br><br>
General approach for the synthesis of compound of formula (Ic) (wherein Ra is hydrogen or methyl and R1, R2, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are as defined above) is depicted in scheme 6. Direct coupling of compounds of the general formula (8) with appropriate amines of formula (23) by using suitable base (e.g., sodium hydride) and in suitable solvent (e.g. toluene, tetrahydrofuran) gives compound of the general formula (1c). Alternatively, compounds of the general formula (lc) can be prepared in two steps by hydrolysis of (8) under basic conditions to give the carboxylic acid (9) followed by its coupling with amine of the general formula (23) using a suitable coupling agents [e.g., N~ ethyl-/V'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate [BOP]) in suitable solvent or mixture of solvents (e.g., N,N-dimethyl formamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane etc. to give compounds of the general formula (Ic).<br><br>
A general approach for the synthesis of furo[3,4-d]pyrimidinyl acetamides of formula (lb) wherein Ra, U, V, Rl and R2 are as defined above is as shown in scheme 7. 5-MethylAH~furo[3,4-d][l,3]oxazine-2,40H)-dione of the formula (13) can be prepared according to the procedure described by Press, J. B., et al, Eur. J, Med. Chem. 1989, 24,<br><br>
627-630 starting from dialkyl 2-methy]furan-3,4-dicarboxylate. The intermediate of the formula (1) is treated with alkyl amine of the formula R'-NI-h to give the urea derivative (14) through a ring opening reaction. Cyclisation of intermediate (14) using 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) in suitable solvent followed by alkylation with R2X in the presence of a suitable solvent gives 3,5-dialkylfuro[3,4-a[]pyrimidine-2,4(lH,3H)-dione of the formula (16) via intermediate (15). Intermediate (16) is deprotonated with a strong base such as sodium hydride or n-butyl lithium and reacted with dialkyl carbonate to give the ester (17). Coupling reaction of ester of the formula (17) with appropriate amines of formula (2) in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in the presence of suitable solvent such as dry toluene or xylene gives compound of general formula (lb).<br><br>
A general approach for the synthesis of substituted 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole of the formula (23) (wherein R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are as defined above) from benzoic acid derivative is given in scheme 8. Thus, benzoic acid of formula (18) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (19) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichioromethane. The acid chloride of formula (19) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula (21) by treating with N.O-dimethyl  hydroxyl amine hydrochloride of formula (20) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of methyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide of formula (21) afforded acetophenone derivative of formula (22).<br>
Conversion of acetophenone derivative of formula (22) to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole of the formula (23) can be effected by two approaches (scheme 8). In the first case acetophenone was converted to the corresponding phenacyl bromide, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, acetophenone derivative of formula (22) can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole (23) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol<br><br>

General procedure for the preparation of 2-amino-4-arvl thiazoles: Method 1:<br>
A solution of acetophenone derivative (1.0 equiv) in glacial acetic acid (5 vol) was added liquid bromine (1.0 equiv) at 0Â°C and reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The crude product obtained upon concentration was dissolved in dry THF (10 volumes) and thiourea (2.0 equiv) was added and refluxed overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with<br><br>
sodium thiosulfate solution and organic layer was treated with IN HC1 to result in salt formation of the amine. The precipitated salt was collected by filtration. The salt was then treated with saturated solution of NaHC03 to re-generate the amine. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 50 ml) and the combined organic extracts were washed with water and brine. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole derivative. Method 2:<br>
A solution of acetophenone derivative (1.0 equiv.), thiourea (2.0 equiv.) and iodine (1.0 equiv.) in dry ethanol (5 volumes) was refluxed for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and the layer was separated. The organic layer was washed with sodium thiosulfate solution to remove iodine. The ethyl acetate solution was treated with IN HCI and precipitated salt collected by filtration. The free amine was re-generated as described in method 1 given above.<br>
All,the 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole derivatives were prepared by either method 1 or method 2 starting from appropriate aryl alkyl  ketones. Structure information and characterization data for selected intermediates are given in Table 1.<br>

Pharmacological activity<br>
The illustrative examples of the present invention are screened for TRPAI activity according to a modified procedure described in (a) Toth, A. et al. Life Sciences, 2003, 73, 487-498. (b) McNamara C, R. el al, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A., 2007, 104, 13525-13530. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Screening for TRPAI antagonist using the 45Calcium uptake assay:<br>
The inhibition of TRPA1 receptor activation was measured as inhibition of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl2 to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPA1 expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 Î¼g / ml of G-4I8. Rat TRPAI expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 Î¼g / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 Î¼M (for human TRPAI) and / or 10 Î¼M (for rat TRPAI) and 5 Î¼Ci/ml 45Ca+2 for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in- a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant. (Toth et al, Life Sciences (2003) 73, 487-498; McNamara CR et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, (2007) 104. 13525-13530).<br>
Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. IC50 values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.<br><br>
The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 4. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 uM and 10.0 Î¼M are given in the table along with IC50 (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 4 wherein "A" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM; "B" refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and "C" refers to IC50 value of more than 100.0 nM<br>
