Description<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound of the formula 1, its preparation,<br>
intermediates for the preparation and the use of the compounds of the formula 1 as<br>
catalysts in various metathesis reactions.<br><br>
Ruthenium complexes of the formula A are known from WO 02/1.4376 A2 and are<br>
described as active, air-stable and recoverable metathesis catalysts. Further catalysts of<br>
this type which are described by the formulae B, C and D and have an even higher<br>
activity than A have become known (Angew. Chem. 2002, 114, No. 5, 832-834;<br>
Angew. Chem. 2002,114, No. 13, 2509-2511; Angew. Chem. 2002, 114, No. 21. 4210-<br>
4212).<br>
The improvement in the activity of B and C compared to A is attributed to steric and<br>
electronic effects of the substituents on the benzene ring, and in the case of D to a<br>
specific change in the aliphatic radical of the ether group of the ligand.<br><br><br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a further increase in the activity of ruthenium<br>
catalysts of the formula A can be achieved, even compared to D, by introducing a keto<br>
group into the aliphatic radical of the ether group of the ligand.<br>

pairs. The invention therefore encompasses not only any racemates but likewise the<br><br>
pure enantiomers which can transfer their asymmetry to a substrate during catalysis as a<br>
result of the asymmetric center.<br>

in which two compounds which each contain an olefinie double bond or one of the<br>
compounds contains at least two olefinie double bonds are reacted and in which one of<br>
the abovementioned compounds of the formula 1 is used as catalyst, and also a process<br>
for carrying out a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) or a cross methathesis (CM) in which<br>
a compound containing two olefmic double bonds as substrate and one of the<br>
compounds of the formula 1 as catalyst participate.<br>

die term "C?.n-aralkyr refers to branched and unbranched alkyl groups which have<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and are substituted by an aromatic ring system having 6<br>
carbon atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are: benzyl. 1- and 2-phenylethyi.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the aromatics can be substituted by one or more radicals<br>
selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, hydroxy,<br>
fluorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
PREPARATION OF THE COMPOUNDS<br>
The reaction of the ruthenium complexes of the formula 3 with the preligands of the<br>
formula 2 is carried out in inert solvents, e.g. CH2CI2, at from about 0° to 80°C. It is<br>
advantageous to add CuGl to the reaction mixture. The reactants are generally used in<br>
stoichiometric amounts, but the more valuable component in each case can be used in a<br>
substoichiometric amount to increase the yield It can also be advantageous to generate<br>
the complex of the formula 3 in situ from other ruthenium compounds and ligand<br>
precursors, e.g. o^ydroimidazolMtim salts, and proceed via the resulting complexes of<br>
the formula 3 in order to arrive at the novel metathesis catalysts of the formula I having<br>
the ligand combination desired in each case.<br>
The metathesis catalysts of the formula 1 prepared by the ligand exchange reaction can<br>
be separated off from Other reaction products which are insoluble in the reaction<br>
mixture by filtration of their solution and, after evaporation of the solution, obtained in<br><br>
pure form by chromatography or crystallization. However, it is also possible to use the<br>
crude products or the catalysts generated in situ directly for carrying out metathesis<br>
reactions.<br>
The preligands of the formula 2 can be prepared in a manner known per se from<br>
o-alkenylphenols by alkylation using a-haloketones.<br>
Particular preference is given to a novel combined process which starts out from<br>
unsubstituted or appropriately substituted phenyl allyl ethers which are subjected to<br>
Claisen rearrangement and catalytic double bond isomerization to give unsubstituted or<br>
appropriately substituted 2-alkenylphenols which are subsequently converted into<br>
compounds of the formula 2 by alkylation using a-haloketones.<br>
The alkylation of phenols to form alkyl phenyl ethers is well known to those skilled in<br>
the art; it is usually carried out in solvents in the presence of basic substances by<br>
reaction with nucleophilic reagents. The reaction with a-haloketones proceeds<br>
particularly smoothly and in good yields. Possible solvents are, for example, alcohols<br>
such as ethanol or aprotic polar solvents such as dimethyiformamide. The alkylation can<br>
also be carried out under phase transfer conditions. Basic substances which may be<br>
mentioned are alkali metal carbonates, and it is likewise possible to use the alkali metal<br>
salts of the intermediates containing a free aromatically bound OH group for this<br>
reaction. The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of the metathesis catalyst of the formula la<br>
1.1 Preparation of the novel preligand of the formula 2a<br>
A mixture of 7.112g (50.0 mmol) of 2-propenylphenol (E/Z mixture), 7.041 g of<br>
potassium carbonate (50.0 mmol) and 20 ml of acetone was stirred at the boiling point<br>
under reflux for 20 minutes. A mixture of 6.94 g (75.0 mmol) of chloroacetone. 0.171 g<br><br>
(1.0 mmol) of potassium iodide and 6.5 ml of acetone which had been activated<br>
beforehand by stirring overnight at room temperature was then added to the reaction<br>
mixture and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at the boiling point under reflux.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, added to 50 ml of water and<br>
extracted three times with 40 ml each time of diethyl ether. The organic phase was<br>
washed with 5% strength sodium hydroxide solution, separated off, dried over Na2SO4<br>
and evaporated. Distillation of the crude product under reduced pressure gave 6.788 g<br>
(yield: 67% of theory) of 2-propenylphenyloxymethyl methyl ketone of the formula 2a:<br><br>

1.2 Preparation of the metathesis catalyst of the formula la<br>
62 mg (0.32 mmol) of the compound 2a, 34 mg (0.34 mmol) of CuCl and 12 ml of<br>
dicbioromethane were placed in a Schlenk tube. 230 mg (0.27 mmol) of Grubbs<br>
catalyst, 2nd generation, were then added. The reaction mixture was stirred at the reflux<br>
temperature under argon for 20 minutes. The crude product obtained after filtration and<br>
evaporation of the solvent was purified by chromatography. (Silica gel Merck grade<br>
9385, eluent: AcOEt/cyclohexane 1:1). This gave 142 mg (82% of theory) of the pure<br>
catalyst of the formula la.<br><br><br>
