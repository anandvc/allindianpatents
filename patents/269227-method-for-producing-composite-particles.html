				<td>Method for producing composite particles<br><br>
The present invention provides processes for producing composite particles based on soluble organic polymers and silicon compounds, to the products obtainable by the processes, and to the use thereof, for example, as an additive, binder or cobinder for different applications.<br><br>
Composite particles contain organic and inorganic domains, for example an organic polymer matrix and inorganic particles fixed thereto, and typically have a diameter of 4 to 5000 nm.<br><br>
In common processes for producing composite particles, organic monomers are polymerized by means of emulsion polymerization in aqueous dispersions of inorganic particles, which anchors organic domains on the surface of the inorganic particles, as described, for example, in Dong—Ming Qi, J. of Applied Polym. Sci., 2006, Vol. 99, pages 3425 to 3432; Tsutomu Mizutani, J. of Applied Polym. Sci., 2006, Vol. 99, pages 659 to 669; Frank Bauer, Macromol. Mater. Eng., 2006291, pages 493 to 498, or in DE-A 10 2004 010 155, US 3,544,500, US 4,421,660 or WO-A 2006/072464.<br><br>
However, the fixing of the organic and inorganic domains of the composite particles and the provision of stable composite particles present problems. This is because the inorganic particles or starting materials thereof and the organic monomers or the organic polymer matrices usually have different polarities and tend to separate from one another or agglomerate with one another.<br><br>
If such an agglomeration occurs before or during the production of the composite particles, for example, the agglomerated inorganic particles are encapsulated by the  organic  polymer  matrix  in  the  course  of polymerization of the organic monomers, such that there is no homogeneous fixing of inorganic particles on the organic polymer matrix, and hence there is ultimately no formation of chemically homogeneous composite particles formed from organic and inorganic domains. <br><br>
Corresponding mixtures are not in the form of colloidal primary particles in solvents. It may even be the case that the inorganic particles and the organic polymer matrix are present alongside one another as a blend.<br><br>
However, there may also be agglomeration of the inorganic or organic domains in composite particles formed homogeneously from inorganic and organic domains, which lead to inadequate storage stability, especially of dissolved, emulsified or dispersed composite particles, and is manifested by gelation or spot formation. Especially at relatively high temperatures, for example from 40°C, such agglomeration occurs. Aqueous dispersions of particles formed exclusively from inorganic units, for example colloidal silica or organopolysiloxanes, likewise tend to agglomerate at relatively high temperatures, for example at 70°C, or even at room temperature.<br><br>
Agglomerated composite particles no longer have the desired performance properties or are completely unusable. In order to provide, for example, stable aqueous dispersions of composite particles, typically emulsifiers, protective colloids or specific additives are added as stabilizers, for example the hydroxyl-containing alkylamino compounds recommended in DE-A 10 2004 010 155.<br><br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide processes for producing composite particles, with which the abovementioned disadvantages are avoided, and with which especially composite particles which are also storage-stable in the form of dispersions are obtainable, ideally even without use of stabilizers.<br><br>
The object is surprisingly achieved by processes in which hydrolyzable or OH-containing silicon compounds have been condensed in the presence of soluble polymers, wherein inorganic particles have been fixed to the soluble polymers.<br><br>
Known composite particles are obtained by free-radically initiated copolymerization of ethylenically unsaturated organic monomers and ethylenically unsaturated inorganic particles, for example the ethylenically unsaturated siloxanes proposed in EP-A 1620271.<br><br>
WO-A 2007/057382 describes silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols which are obtained by free-radically initiated polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated silane-containing monomers in the presence of polyvinyl alcohols.<br><br>
DE-A 102007038333 discloses compositions which have been prepared by condensation of silicon compounds in the presence of polyvinyl alcohols, although the inorganic particles formed had not been fixed on polyvinyl alcohols but were present alongside them in the composition as a blend.<br><br>
EP-A 1243619 discloses composite materials consisting of organic domains such as polyacrylic acid, and inorganic domains, for example sodium silicates or colloidal silica, wherein the organic and inorganic domains are joined by ionic interactions with divalent metal cations, such that the composite materials are present as aggregates of the polymeric domains in the form of gels.<br><br>

The monomers and the proportions by weight of the comonomers are generally selected so as to result in a glass transition temperature Tg of -50°C to +50°C, preferably -30°C to +40°C. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymers can be determined in a known manner by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The Tg can also be calculated approximately in advance by means of the Fox equation. According to Fox T.G., Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1, 3, page 123 (1956) 1/Tg = xl/Tgl + x2/Tg2 + ... + xn/Tgn, where xn is the mass fraction (% by weight/100) of the monomer n, and Tgn is the glass transition temperature in kelvin of the homopolymer of the monomer n. Tg values for homopolymers are listed in the Polymer Handbook 2nd Edition, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1975).<br><br>
The soluble polymers based on the monomers a) and b) can be prepared by suspension, solvent, bulk or preferably emulsion polymerization processes known to those skilled in the art, as described, for example, in DE-A 102006050336. The emulsion polymerization process is preferably performed at a pH between 3 and 6.<br><br>
In addition to the soluble polymers based on the monomers a) and b), it is also possible to use functionalized, partly or fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols in the process according to the invention, which are obtainable by hydrolyzing those soluble polymers whose monomer units b) derive, exclusively or partly from vinyl esters. The functionalized, partly or fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols are produced by common processes, by hydrolyzing the soluble polymers containing vinyl ester units in alcoholic solution, analogously to the manner described, for example, in DE-A 10140131.<br><br>
In addition to soluble polymers based on the monomers a) and b), it is also possible in the process according to the invention to use silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols which are obtained by treating vinyl alcohol polymers with one or more silicon compounds of the formulae (2) or (3) at elevated temperature, such as &gt; 30°C or preferably. 50°C to 100°C. Preference is given to using 1 to 25% by weight of silicon compounds of the formulae (2) or (3), based on the weight of the vinyl alcohol polymer. Such silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols and the preparation thereof are described in WO-A 2007/057382. The vinyl alcohol polymers used to prepare the silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols are obtainable by hydrolyzing polyvinyl esters based on one or more of the vinyl esters listed under the monomers b), preferably vinyl acetate, and optionally one or more further monomers b) other than vinyl esters, and optionally one or more monomers a).<br><br>
Preferred silicon compounds of the formulae (2) or (3) for treatment of the vinyl alcohol polymers for the preparation of the silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols are the same as correspondingly listed above for the condensation reaction. Preferred functionalized, partly or fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols are obtainable, for example, by treatment of vinyl alcohol polymers with vinyltrimethoxysilane or vinyltriethoxysilane.<br>
Suitable functionalized, partly or fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols or vinyl alcohol polymers for the preparation of the silane-modified polyvinyl alcohols have a degree of hydrolysis of the vinyl ester units of preferably 50 mol% to 99.99 mol%, more preferably of 70 mol% to 99 mol%, most preferably of &gt; 96 mol%. Fully hydrolyzed polymers refer to those whose degree of hydrolysis is &gt; 96 mol%. Partly hydrolyzed vinyl ester polymers are understood to mean those with a degree of hydrolysis of &gt; 50 mol% and 
<br>
In addition to the soluble polymers based on monomers a) and b), it is also possible in the process according to the invention to use functionalized polyvinylacetals which are obtainable by partial or full acetalization<br><br>
of the functionalized, partly or fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols. The functionalized polyvinyl acetals are prepared by common processes, by acetalizing the polyvinyl alcohols mentioned with aldehydes, as described, for example, in DE-A 10140131.<br>
Preferred aldehydes from the group of the aliphatic aldehydes having 1 to 15 carbon atoms are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and most preferably butyraldehyde or a mixture of butyraldehyde and acetaldehyde. The aromatic aldehydes used may, for example, be benzaldehyde or derivatives thereof.<br><br>
The degree of acetalization of the functionalized polyvinylacetals can be adjusted by the amount of aldehyde used. Because the acetalization proceeds with almost complete conversion, the amount added can be determined by simple stoichiometric calculation. <br>
In addition to the soluble polymers based on the monomers a) and b), it is also possible to use natural polymers or chemically or physically modified natural polymers. Examples of natural polymers are cellulose, starch, xanthans or polylactides.<br><br>
In the production of the composite particles, the proportion of the soluble polymers is preferably 3 to 9 8% by weight, more preferably 5 to 80% by weight and most preferably 35 to 60% by weight, based in each case on the dry mass of the amount of soluble polymers and silicon components used overall.<br><br>
In the process according to the invention, the silicon components and the soluble polymers can be used in pure form or in a solvent. The silicon components and the soluble polymers can be initially charged completely in a solvent for the condensation. Alternatively, a portion of the silicon components and of the soluble polymers can be initially charged for the condensation,<br><br>
and the remainder of the silicon components and of the soluble polymers can be added during the condensation. When all or some of the silicon components are initially charged and the soluble polymers are added at a later time, a preliminary condensation of the silicon components can proceed before the particles formed are fixed to the soluble polymers. The soluble polymers are preferably initially charged in a solvent or a solvent mixture, and some or all of the silicon components are added in pure form during the condensation.<br>
The temperature during the condensation is preferably 1 to 100 °C, more preferably 10 to 80 °C and most preferably 20 to 60°C. The reaction time of the condensation is preferably 4 to 24 hours, more preferably 5 to 12 hours.<br><br>
The process for producing the composite particles is preferably performed at pH values between 2 and 12, more preferably at pH values between 7 and 12 and most preferably at pH values between 8 and 10. In the case that the silicon compounds of the formula (1) which bear one or more epoxy radicals are used, the composite particles are produced preferably at pH values of 4 to 7.<br><br>
The pH value can be adjusted in a known manner by means of organic or inorganic acids, bases or buffers, for example by adding hydrochloric acid, ammonia or alkali metal hydroxides, for example sodium hydroxide solution. The pH can also be adjusted by means of the silicon compounds of the formula (1) and, if appropriate, of the silicon compounds of the formula (3), if the silicon compounds mentioned bear an amino, ammonium, carboxylic acid or phospho radical. Preferably, no polyvalent ions, such as multiply charged metal ions, for example alkaline earth metal ions, are introduced into the composite particles as acids, bases or buffers, since such ions can lead to aggregation of composite particles and hence to gelation of the composite particles.<br><br>
The acids, bases or buffers mentioned may also be used as a catalyst for the condensation of the	silicon compounds of the formula (1) and optionally	of the formulae (2) and (3).<br>
During the condensation, it is possible to use emulsifiers. When the condensation is performed in the presence of emulsifiers, the amount thereof is preferably 1 to 5% by weight, based on the solids content. Suitable emulsifiers are anionic, cationic and nonionic emulsifiers, for example anionic surfactants such as alkyl sulfates having a chain length of 8 to 18 carbon atoms, alkyl or alkylaryl ether sulfates having 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the hydrophobic radical and up to 40 ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units, alkyl-or alkylarylsulfonates having 8 to 18 carbon atoms, esters and monoesters of sulfosuccinic acid with monohydric alcohols or alkylphenols, or nonionic surfactants such as alkyl polyglycol ethers or alkylaryl polyglycol ethers having 8 to 40 ethylene oxide units. Preferably, no emulsifiers are added before, during or after the condensation.<br><br>
The composite particles thus obtainable are in the form of a dispersion and preferably have a solids content of 10 to 65% by weight, more preferably of 10 to 50% by weight, even more preferably of 20 to 40% by weight and most preferably of 25 to 35% by weight.<br><br>
On completion of the condensation reaction, byproducts, unconverted starting materials, solvents or other volatile substances can be removed by means of distillation, preferably under reduced pressure, and optionally while passing entraining gases through or over, such as air, nitrogen or water vapor.<br><br>
To produce the composite particles in the form of powders, the dispersions of the composite particles are dried, optionally with addition of protective colloids as a drying aid. Suitable drying processes are, for example, fluidized bed drying, roller drying, freeze-drying or spray-drying. Suitable drying assistants are, for example, the abovementioned soluble polymers. Preference is given to using polyvinyl alcohols as drying assistants. Preference is given to spray-drying the aqueous mixtures. The spray-drying is effected in customary spray-drying systems, wherein the atomization can be effected by means of one-substance, two-substance or multisubstance nozzles, or with a rotating disk. The exit temperature is generally selected within the range from 45°C to 120°C, preferably between 60°C and 90°C.<br><br>
For the drying, a content of up to 1.5% by weight of antifoam, based on the polymeric constituents, has been found to be favorable in many cases. To increase the storability by improving the blocking stability, especially in the case of powders with low glass transition temperature, the powder obtained can be modified with an antiblocking agent (anticaking agent), preferably up to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of polymeric constituents. Examples of antiblocking agents are calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate, talc, gypsum, silicas, for example finely divided silicas, kaolins, metakaolin, calcined kaolin, silicates with particle sizes preferably in the range from 10 nm to 100 jum.<br><br>
The viscosity of the dispersion to be dried is adjusted via the solids content so as to obtain a value of 
<br>
To improve the performance properties, further additives can be added to the composite particles.<br><br>
Further constituents of the composite particles, present in preferred embodiments, are,, for example, binders, pigments, fillers, for example zeolites, foam stabilizers, hydrophobing agents or air pore formers. These additives are preferably added during or after the drying of the dispersion.<br><br>
The composite particles thus obtained in the form of powders can be converted to the desired form by subsequent grinding and/or redispersion in water, organic solvents or reactive diluents. Suitable reactive diluents are, for example, the ethylenically unsaturated substance classes and compounds listed above under the monomers a) or monomers b) . Preferred reactive diluents are ethylenically unsaturated aromatics, such as styrene, (meth)acrylates, such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, or epoxides.<br><br>
The  invention  further provides  composite particles obtainable by condensation of<br>
a) one or more silicon compounds of the general formula(RO)nSiR14-n (1) in which R   is an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or alkoxy alkyl radical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a hydrogen atom, R1   is an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a hydrogen atom, and n   is from 2 to 4, or 3) one or more condensation products of the silicon compounds of the formula (1) in a solvent or a mixture of two or more solvents in the presence of one or more soluble polymers, said  soluble  polymers  being  obtainable  by  free-radically initiated polymerization of<br>
a) one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers having one or more further functional groups selected from the group comprising carboxylic acid groups or derivatives thereof, silane, sulfo, sulfate, phosphate, phosphonate,  isocyanate,  amine,  quaternized  amine,<br>
 hydrazine, epoxy, ether, hydroxyl or CO groups, and b) one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers selected from the group comprising vinyl esters of carboxylic acids having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, methacrylic esters or acrylic esters of carboxylic acids with unbranched or branched alcohols having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, olefins and dienes, vinylaromatics and vinyl halides, condensation products formed from the silicon compounds a) or condensation products P) or condensation products thereof being fixed on one or more soluble polymers.<br><br>
Especially the functional groups of the monomer units a) of the soluble polymers lead to fixing of the inorganic particles. The fixing is based essentially on chemical interaction, such as covalent bonds, or physical interaction, such as ionic bonds or hydrogen bonds. The inorganic particles are fixed essentially in random distribution on the polymer chain of the soluble polymer of the particular composite particle.<br><br>
The composite particles preferably have a viscosity of 20 to 2000 mPas (Brookfield viscosity at 25°C as a 25% solution in water).<br><br>
The composite particles in the form of an aqueous dispersion with a solids content of 10% by weight have a turbidity of preferably ≤ 700 EBC, more preferably ≤ 600 EBC, even more preferably ≤ 400 EBC and most preferably≤200 EBC (determination according to Formazin standard to DIN 38404 at room temperature with the Metrisa turbidimeter: TA6FS/model 251).<br><br>
The inorganic domains of the composite particles have mean particle sizes of preferably 5 nm to 800 nm, more preferably of 5 nm to 50 nm and most preferably of 5 nm to 30 nm (determined with the Libra 120 transelectron microscope from Zeiss).<br><br>
In the course of the inventive condensation, preferably &gt; 30%, more preferably &gt; 40% and most preferably 70 to 80% of the hydrolyzable or condensable bonds of the silicon compounds of the formula (1) and optionally of the formulae (2) and (3), based on the total number of hydrolyzable or condensable bonds of the silicon compounds mentioned, are joined to the soluble polymers or the silicon compounds or condensation products thereof used. Hydrolyzable bonds are especially the alkoxy groups RO of the formula (1) or the alkoxy groups OR9 of the formula (2). Condensable bonds are especially the OH groups bonded to silicon atoms.<br><br>
The inventive composite particles are stable in organic solvents, reactive diluents or water or in the form of powders, even without addition of stabilizers, emulsifiers or protective colloids.<br><br>
The composite particles are suitable as binders, cobinders or additives for improving the performance properties of many kinds of products. Use of the composite particles in coating materials or adhesives allows, for example, the thermal stability or scratch resistance thereof to be enhanced. Adhesives comprising composite particles frequently additionally exhibit improved flow performance and a stable modulus of elasticity at elevated temperature, and give rise on application, for example, to removable adhesive films. With coating materials comprising composite particles, it is possible to provide coatings with a matt effect. It is equally possible to use the composite particles in formulations for powder coatings, polymer materials and composite materials, for example for production of polymer components, composite components or packaging materials. The composite particles are also suitable for surface treatment for synthetic or natural materials, such as fibers or particles, such as preferably stone, wood, leather, paper, textiles, plastics,  such as plastic films.  In this case, the<br><br>
composite particles act, for example, as primers for promoting adhesion, as a barrier layer, to prevent corrosion or to repel soil. The soil-repellant effect can advantageously be exploited especially in corresponding applications in carpets including fitted carpets. The composite particles can also be used to produce noncombustible coatings for wood, plastics, leather and paper. Stone may be reinforced or renovated. In products in the packaging industry, addition of the composite particles can generate a gas barrier.<br>
