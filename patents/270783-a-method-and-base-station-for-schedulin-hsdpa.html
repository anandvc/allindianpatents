				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to scheduling of data being transmitted over the air interface.<br>
More particular, the invention relates to a method and an apparatus for HSDPA scheduling.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In HSDPA (High Speed Data Packet Access), where many users utilize physical resources<br>
on a specific shared channel, a packet scheduler is needed for scheduling the packets at<br>
given time instants, or transmission opportunities. The task of the scheduler is to select a<br>
user or a plurality of users that shall be allowed for having a transmission performed during<br>
a certain transmission time interval (TTI). In a cellular system, data queues pertaining<br>
to individual users are consecutively evaluated. Various selections shall be done at every<br>
scheduling instant, e.g. at every sub-frame for HSDPA, and according to a certain scheduling<br>
strategy.<br>
Packet schedulers and scheduling strategies for HSDPA are widely known in the art. For<br>
HSDPA, the packet scheduler is located in the MAC-hs sub layer of layer 2, on the UT-<br>
RAN side. This is standardized according to 3GPP TS 25.321, Medium Access Control<br>
(MAC) protocol specification, c.f. fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows different entities required for the traffic data handling in the MAC-hs layer.<br>
A user given access to the HSDPA service comprises a number of MAC-d flows, sent on<br>
the Iub interface, each one containing packets of one or several priorities. These packets<br>
are buffered in MAC-hs in different priority queues via the priority queue distribution en-<br>
tity. Furthermore, as can be seen, there exists a scheduling/priority handling routine that<br>
considers all priority queues and selects which one shall transmit for each transmission<br>
opportunity. The priority queue selected for transmission is allocated resources in the so<br>
called HARQ (Hybrid Automatic repeat Request) entity, where the scheduled packet is<br>
stored for transmission and possibly one or more retransmissions. Finally there is a TFRC<br>
(Transport Format and Resource Combination) selection routine running that decides, for<br>
each transmitted package how much physical resources shall be allocated in terms of<br><br>
transmission power (W), number of HS-PDSCH codes and modulation<br>
(QPSK/16QAM(Quadrature Phase Shift Keying/ 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)).<br>
In fig. 2, a known network is shown comprising a content server, a core network (CN), a<br>
radio network controller (RNC), a radio base station (RBS) and a plurality of user entities<br>
(UEL.UEn). Downlink Traffic data pertaining to each user entity is transmitted through<br>
the RNC and further on to the RBS, whereby data is buffered in queues residing in the<br>
RNC, index QN, respectively and in the RBS, index QB, respectively.<br>
Prior art document WO2005/034418 shows a medium access control (MAC) priority<br>
queue based scheduling pertaining to HSDPA. The scheduling unit is based on hybrid<br>
automatic repeat request (HARQ) entity and a TFRC entity.<br>
Each user entity may require various scheduling priorities for various data streams, depending<br>
on the service. Voice over IP may e.g. require 2 scheduling priorities, while web<br>
surfing only a single scheduling priority reflecting the best effort nature of the service. For<br>
this reason, a number of specific queues are set up in both the RNC and the RBS, pertaining<br>
to a given user entity and data stream. By way of example, data queue QB(1,2) corresponds<br>
to packets for user entity UE1, second scheduling priority.<br>
Data pertaining to each user entity is transmitted from the content server over the core network,<br>
further on over the Iu Interface to the RNC where various data corresponding to<br>
various respective data streams are stored in priority queues. The data of queues in the<br>
RNC in fig. 2 may be identified by QN(UE, DS), where UE is the user entity number and<br>
DS is the identifier for the particular data stream. Since a service typically consists of several<br>
parallel data streams, there may be several priority queues for a given user entity, or<br>
there may be only one queue of traffic data, in the RNC or in the RBS respectively. The<br>
priority queues may contain one or more packets or no packets at all. However, once a<br>
user is allocated to the HSPDA service of the network, data could be expected for that particular<br>
user.<br>
In known solutions, all priority queues of all users are considered for transmission in a<br>
scheduler in each sub-frame. Thus, in the hardware implementation, for each priority<br>
queue that is allowed, the HSDPA service in a cell demands a certain amount of clock cy-<br><br>
cle capacity and memory consumption. This puts a fundamental limit on scheduler capac-<br>
ity.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is a first object to set forth a scheduler unit, which can manage an enhanced level of end<br>
user traffic more efficiently for given hardware resources.<br>
This object has been accomplished by the subject matter defined in claim 1.<br>
It is a second object to set forth a method for selection and scheduling that can manage an<br>
enhanced level of end user traffic more efficiently for given hardware resources.<br>
This object has been accomplished by the subject matter set forth in claim 14.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
Notation<br>
A given user entity UEX according may require a number of priority queues, PQ(X,Y)<br>
PQ(X, Z) relating to the data of incoming packets for different priorities. Accordingly, in<br>
the radio base station, knowledge is established for buffering, managing and transmitting<br>
the data streams to be delivered to the individual user entities. The structure of this data as<br>
well as the used notation for each individual user entity has been illustrated in fig. 3. The<br>
data relates to the specified MAC-hs handling seen in fig 1. The figure comprises a representation<br>
of a UE granted service to HSDPA. It consists of a HARQ entity (HE) and also a<br>
number of priority queues (c.f. fig 1). Each priority queue PQ(X,Z), in turn, has been further<br>
broken down into three different entities. Namely, QB(X,Z) is representing the buffered<br>
traffic data (packets) of the priority queue, QB_PAR(X,Z) representing the parameter<br>
subset of the priority queue, and DI(X,Z) representing the delay of each priority queue.<br>
These three representations will be described in detail later.<br>
In fig. 4, the indexing employed for an exemplary situation of a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention is illustrated. The ensemble of all priority queues PQ for all users UE are arranged<br>
in one array with index 1,..., A+B. Where A+B is the maximum number of priority<br><br>
queues that can be set up in a particular cell. The users that each one of the priority queues<br>
belong to is simply denoted X and could range from l,...,Nue, where Nue is the maximum<br>
number of users (UE) that can be set up in the very same cell, see fig 3.<br>
The priority queues are denoted PQ(X, 1,..., A+B) in this description. The index X represents<br>
any user (in range l,...,Nue) which happens to be connected to the priority queue in<br>
question.<br>
Furthermore, with regard to figs. 3-5, the array of priority queues are divided into two<br>
different subsets, whereby S1={PQ(X, 1),...,PQ(X, A)} and S2={PQ(X, A+1),...,PQ(X,<br>
A+B)}. The subset SPSI U S2 is the totality of all priority queues in the cell. In the example<br>
outlined in fig 4, it can be seen that the UE with index 8 has one priority queue residing<br>
in priority set SI and another residing in S2. This situation is allowed.<br>
Base station<br>
In fig. 5, a preferred embodiment of a radio base station RBS is shown comprising a first<br>
Interface (Iub) for receiving downlink data packets from a core network CN, a second Interface<br>
(Uu) for transmitting data packets to user entities, a processor CPU comprising or<br>
running a scheduling selection routine SSR, implementing the scheduling/priority handling<br>
in fig 1, a transfer routine TR, and a data detect routine DDR, implementing the priority<br>
queue distribution mechanism in fig 1. Finally, the standardized TFRC selection routine<br>
TFR is provided for allocation physical resources for the selected packet and transmit<br>
it on the Uu interface.<br>
The processor carries out a data detect routine DDR is shown in fig. 8, the transfer routine<br>
TR is shown in fig. 9, and the scheduling selection routine SSR is shown in fig. 10.<br>
The processor receives data on the Iub Interface and communicates data to the first and<br>
second memories. Finally, the processor transmits scheduled packets over the Uu interface.<br>
According to the invention, the specific scheduling selection scheme makes use of what<br>
shall be denoted as at least two memory partitions, PRT1 and PRT2.<br><br>
Respective parameter data QB_PAR(X,Y) relating to respective subsets of priority queues,<br>
S1 and S2, are stored in respective memory partitions, PRT1 and PRT2.<br>
The radio bases station of fig. 5, allows for A+B priority queues to be allocated for the<br>
service in the cell. The priority queues of the first subset SI are not considered for scheduling,<br>
whereas the priority queues in the second subset S2 are considered. Thus, a maximum<br>
of B priority queues are considered in the scheduler at any given time. Hence, according<br>
to the invention, not all priority queues that are granted access to the service are<br>
considered for scheduling at each transmission opportunity.<br>
According to preferred embodiment of the invention, the data detect routine DDR detects<br>
incoming data. The processor CPU is transferring parameter data between the first PRT1<br>
and the second PRT2 memory partition, and vice versa, by means of the transfer routine<br>
TR and the scheduling selection routine SSR, respectively. The processor takes into account<br>
traffic data, or packets, which are buffered for all users in QB(X,1),...,QB(X, A+B).<br>
Preferably, the packet data of a priority queue remains in the first memory partition PRT1<br>
until it is scheduled for transmission by the scheduling routine SCH, as will be described<br>
in more detail later.<br>
Parameter data of a priority queue should preferably only exist in one partition at a time,<br>
that is, redundant copies of parameter data should advantageously be avoided.<br>
Memory<br>
Advantageously, parameter data pertaining to the first subset S1 is arranged in slow access<br>
memory partition PRT1, while parameter data pertaining to the second subset S2, is arranged<br>
in fast access memory partition PRT2. Since stricter hardware limitations typically<br>
apply to the fast memory PRT2, liberating resources in the fast memory from the parameter<br>
data of the first subset will considerably increase the capacity of the scheduler. This has<br>
been illustrated in fig. 7, whereby M1 is a so-called fast memory and M2 which may have<br>
the same or less efficient read access. Alternatively, both subsets are arranged in the same<br>
memory Ml, but the scheduling selection routine SCH is aware to which set S1 or S2 a<br>
particular priority queue belongs. As mentioned above, consideration is restricted to prior-<br><br>
ity queues belonging to set S2. The memory can be arranged so as to have different physical<br>
partitions of the memory for storing the set SI and S2 respectively (PRT1, PRT2).<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the first memory partition PRT1<br>
resides in an external memory while the second memory partition PRT2 resides in an internal<br>
memory. Traffic data packets P may be stored in respective buffers QB(X, Y) for<br>
corresponding priority queues PQ(X,Y) in the memory partition PRT1. Parameter data relating<br>
to queue status, e.g. channel quality average data rate etc. are divided into the first<br>
memory partition and the second memory partition, so that there is provided parameter<br>
data QB_PAR(X,1) - QB_PAR(X,A) relating to a first subset of the traffic data queues are<br>
stored in the PRT1 memory partition and parameter data QB_PAR(X,A+1) - QB_PAR(X,<br>
A+B) relating to a second subset of the traffic data queues are stored in the PRT2 memory<br>
partition. Delay indicator measures DI(X,1) through DI(X,A+B) for priority queues<br>
QB(X,1) through QB(X,A+B) are provided in the second memory partition PRT2.<br>
DDR<br>
The data detect routine DDR maintains and updates the information whether data exists in<br>
queue and how long data has existed in queue without being transferred from PRT1 to<br>
PRT2. This information is denoted DI(X,1),...,DI(X,A+B). Parameter data of users are<br>
transferred from the first subset to the second subset by the data detect routine, when new<br>
data packets are received for an empty queue (55).<br>
In fig. 8, the data detect routine DDR carried out by the processor is illustrated. The data<br>
detect routine continuously monitors all incoming data packets over the Iub Interface and<br>
determines, for each received data packet step 41, which user and priority queue the data<br>
packet is belonging to among the totality of queues being provided in buffers QB (X,l)<br>
through QB (X,A+B), step 42. In the following, the corresponding queue for the individual<br>
detected packet P will be denoted PQ(X,Y), for user entity X of priority queue Y.<br>
In step 43, it is examined whether buffer QB(X,Y), related to PQ(X,Y), already contains<br>
previous data. If yes, step 45, the packet is placed in the queue, and if no, step 44, the delay<br>
indicator DI(X,Y) is set to 1.<br><br>
TR<br>
In fig. 9, the transferring routine TR is shown being operated in parallel to the data detect<br>
routine of fig. 8. The transfer routine monitors delays, identifies priority queues for which<br>
packets delays are positive, moves parameter data from the first to the second memory<br>
partition and accounts for delays.<br>
In step 51, for each transmission opportunity, for each priority queue PQ(X,Y) with a delay<br>
value DI(X,Y) &gt; 0, step 52, the parameter subset QB_PAR(X,Y), belonging to<br>
PQ(X,Y), with the highest delay value is identified, step 53. Subsequently, step 54, it is<br>
resolved whether the number of priority queues in PRT2 is lower than B.<br>
If yes, the parameter subset QB_PAR(X,Y), belonging to PQ(X,Y), is moved from PRT1<br>
to PRT2 and the corresponding delay value DI(X,Y) is set to 0, step 55. If no, the routine<br>
proceeds to step 56. This continues, cf. step 52, for all QB_PAR(X,Y) related to priority<br>
queues PQ(X,Y) that do not have empty buffers QB(X,Y). The parameter values having<br>
the highest delays, step 53, are transferred to the PRT2 as long as the number of parameter<br>
values in PRT2 is below B, step 54, i.e. if it is acknowledged there is space available in<br>
PRT2.<br>
Still, for the same transmission opportunity (TTI), for each queue, step 56, those queues<br>
having a value greater than 0, step 57, are all incremented, step 58, by 1, and the routine<br>
returns to step 51, in which the routine is iterated for the next transmission opportunity.<br>
SSR<br>
The latter scheduling selection routine SSR is responsible for selecting which priority<br>
queue(s) should be granted resources on the air interface at every transmission opportunity<br>
for TFRC selection, for example. Alternatively any known scheduling routine known from<br>
HSPDA or elsewhere may be utilised for the actual scheduling on the air interface. According<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the scheduling selection routine SSR<br>
is provided for selection and scheduling data packets pertaining to users in a cell. The routine<br>
considers parameter data for queues of individual users (QB_PAR(X,A+1) -<br>
QB_PAR(X,A+B)). Such parameter data could contain anything forming a basis for<br><br>
scheduling, e.g. momentary channel quality, momentary data rate, average data rate, delay,<br>
scheduling frequency, scheduling priority etc. Parameter data of users are transferred by<br>
the scheduling selection routine SSR from the second memory partition to the first memory<br>
partition when the corresponding traffic data queues are emptied (66).<br>
In fig. 10, the scheduling selection routine SSR according to the invention is shown. Also<br>
this routine is commenced for each transmission opportunity, step 61.<br>
In step 62, a selection is carried out for which priority queue that shall transmit, e.g.<br>
PQ(X,Y). The transmission is carried out according to the appropriate scheduling routine<br>
(TFR) which takes into account various factors, signal strength conditions, etc CQI Channel<br>
Quality Indicator (Measurement of the channel quality that is transmitted from UE to<br>
UTRAN). Hence the scheduling selection routine of fig. 10 can be seen as providing the<br>
basis for which the actual scheduling (e.g. TFR) is performed; confer the denotation<br>
scheduling selection routine.<br>
In step 63, still according to an appropriate scheduling routine, it is determined how much<br>
data shall be transmitted for PQ(X,Y).<br>
In step 64 data is fetched from QB(X,Y) residing in PRT2 and transmitted.<br>
In step 65 it is resolved whether the buffer QB(X,Y) is empty after the recent transmission,<br>
if no, the routine proceeds to step 61 waiting for the next scheduling interval, if yes the<br>
corresponding parameter value QB_PAR(X,Y) is moved from PRT2 to PRT1 and proceeds<br>
to step 66. If no the routine goes to step 61.<br>
In step 66, the delay indicator is set to zero and the parameter data QB_PAR(X,Y) is<br>
moved from the first to the second memory partition.<br>
According to the invention, the bursty nature of packet data traffic is exploited so that during<br>
 periods where a given user has no data in queue, the given user is removed from being<br>
considered for scheduling, thus liberating the scheduler from CPU load and memory consumption.<br><br>
Since the nature of packet data traffic is exploited, the above advantage is not present for<br>
services in which data flows exclusively continuously, e.g. streaming services.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first memory is an external<br>
memory, while the second memory is an internal memory co-located with the processor<br>
(CPU), as illustrated in fig. 7.<br>
Alternatively, the first and second memory partition may reside in the same monolithic<br>
chip, whereby the first memory partition is providing less fast access than the second<br>
memory partition.<br>
Packet handling - an example<br>
Fig. 11 shows the situation for one particular PQ(X,Z) for a number of TTIs, sub frames,<br>
or transmission opportunities, numbered from 1 to 14. In TTI1 and 2 the PQ has no data<br>
and resides in memory partition PRT1. The scheduler selection SCH does not consider the<br>
PQ for transmission, denoted by "-"in the corresponding SCH field. Also the data indicator<br>
DI is 0 indicating that no data is present in this buffer QB. In TTI 3 a packet P1 arrives<br>
via its MAC-d flow and is put in the buffer QB(X,Z) via the DDR routine. At the same<br>
time DI(X,Z) is set to 1 indicating that it is the first TTI with data in queue, and queue still<br>
residing in PRT1. In TTI 3-5 the queue still contains data but is not moved to PRT2 due to<br>
lack of memory in PRT2. Hence, the DI(X,Z) increments each TTI indicating that the<br>
waiting time for the PQ with data in buffer QB increases. Also in TTI 5, a new packet P2<br>
arrives to the priority queue buffer QB. In TTI 6 memory is supposedly liberated in PRT2<br>
and the PQ is moved from PRT1 to PRT2. In the very same TTI the scheduling selection<br>
routine SCH selects the PQ, and its packet P1 for transmission, denoted P1 in corresponding<br>
SCH field. Hence, in TTI 7, only P2 is left in buffer QB. Also in TTI 7 the scheduler<br>
considers the PQ(X,Z) for scheduling, but it does not select it, denoted by 0 in the SCH<br>
field. In TTI 8 the scheduler selection routine once again selects the PQ(X,Z) for transmission<br>
and decides to transmit the remaining packet P2. The buffer QB is thus emptied by<br>
scheduler and moved from PRT2 to PRT1. In TTI 10 a new packet arrives and DI is set to<br>
1. In TTI 11 through 14 the PQ cannot be moved to PRT2 due to lack of memory and<br>
hence, DI is incremented.<br><br>
