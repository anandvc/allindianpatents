				<td>NOVEL POLYMERIC BLUE ANTHRAQUINONE-DERIVATIVE COLORANTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an inventive blue colorant comprising a chromophore having at least one poly(oxyalkylene) chain attached, through aromatic amino group (or groups), to the 1- position, the 4- position, or both, of an anthraquinone backbone.  Such colorants exhibit excellent amine/base stability and thermal stability, effective colorations, excellent low extraction rates, and high lightfastness levels, particularly when incorporated within certain media and/or on the surface of certain substrates, particularly polyesters, polyolefins, and polyurethanes. The poly(oxyalkylene) chain or chains can be conveniently tailored to increase the solubility or compatibility in different solvents or resins thereby peirmtting the introduction of such excellent coloring chromophores within diverse media and/or or diverse substrates as well as provides a liquid colorant which facilitates handling. Compositions and articles comprising such colorants are provided as well as methods for producing such inventive colorants.<br>
Discussion of the Prior Art<br>
All U.S. patents cited within this specification are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
There continues to be a need to provide versatile colorants within various applications such that the coloring agent itself exhibits excellent colorations, high thermal stability and amine/base stability, excellent lightfastness, low extraction (or drastic reduction in possibility of removal therefrom via extraction by solvents or like sources), ease in handling, ability to mix thoroughly with other coloring agents and thus to provide effective different hues and tints within or on target substrates, and acceptable toxicity levels. There has been a need to provide improved colorants meeting this criteria for certain thermosets such as polyurethane foam applications, and thermoplastic media, such as polyesters, such that the colorants themselves exhibit excellent compatibility therein (for instance in terms of intrinsic viscosity loss and the other characteristics desired for such plastics as noted above). In particular, such characteristics for polyesters are desired for colorants that absorb, for example, though not necessarily, within the blue portion of the visible spectrum. It is believed and, as noted above, has been determined that such desirable polyester plastic colorations with the characteristics noted above are possible through the addition of certain pendant groups [such as, for example<br>
poly(oxyalkylene) groups] to the chromophore backbone which do not act as couplers or<br>
color modifiers and thus any chromophore (and resultant hue or tint) may be utilized with the<br>
inventive anthraquinone chromophore itself.<br>
Previous coloring agents for such end-uses have included pigments, dyes, or dyestuffs,<br>
with each having its own drawback, be it an extraction problem from the finished article, a<br>
handling problem during manufacturing due to solid dust particles, or a staining problem, due<br>
to the difficulty associated with cleaning coloring agents from manufacturing machinery after<br>
colored plastic production, and other like issues. As a result, the application of such<br>
pigments, dyes, and/or dyestuffs as colorants within plastics (such as polyesters, polyolefins,<br>
polyurethanes, and the like) is greatly limited and far from satisfactory due to such physical<br>
limitations. However, the utilization of such colorants is highly desired for the hues and<br>
shades they provide within the ultimate thermoplastic and thermoset articles themselves. As<br>
a result, there is a clear desire to provide easier to handle, more thermally stable, less<br>
extractable, more base/amine stable, more compatible with to-be-colored substrates or resins,<br>
easy-to-clean, etc, coloring agents for introduction within thermoplastic and thermoset articles<br>
to provide decorative, aesthetic, and other like effects. Facilitating the introduction of such<br>
chromophores within such formulations is thus a highly desired target within the colored<br>
thermoplastic and thermoset industry, whether it be in terms of handling, thermal stability,<br>
extraction, base/amine stability, compatibility, cleaning, or the like.<br>
Attempts to meet this desire have included the introduction of certain standard types<br>
of polymeric colorants within plastics (be they thermoplastics or thermoset types). Such<br>
colorants are primarily poly(oxyalkylenated) compounds, such as triphenylmethanes (i.e.,<br>
those found within U.S. Patent 4,992,204, to Kluger et al.) aliphatic amino anthraquinones<br>
(i.e., those found within U.S. Patents 4,137,243 to Farmer, and 4,846,846 to Rekers et al.),<br>
and the like; however, they also tend to exhibit certain problems during incorporation into<br>
thermosets and/or thermoplastics. In thermosets such as polyurethane foam, many of these<br>
previously disclosed compositions, particularly those including the blue triphenylmethane<br>
colorants, exhibit discoloration problem in association with the basic catalysts utilized and/or<br>
with the high exotherm generated during target foam formation (triphenylmethane moieties of<br>
such colorants are susceptible to attack by nucleophilic catalysts and their residues); and for<br>
those colorants such as aliphatic amino anthraquinones (for example, ReactintÂ® Blue X17<br>
from Milliken &amp; Company) are not stable to high TDI index during polyurethane foam<br>
formation (active hydrogen sites located on the chromophore have been observed to react<br>
with isocyanate groups to alter the shade of product). In thermoplastic compositions such as<br>
polyester, many of the previously disclosed compositions, particularly those including<br>
triphenylmethanes and/or aliphatic amino anthraquinones, are very unstable at within<br>
requisite processing temperature range. As a result, the colorations provided by such<br>
polymeric colorants may be reduced in strength or changed in shade under such<br>
circumstances. Other types of colorants have been discussed within the prior art, such as azos<br>
and diazos, but the specific colorations provided by such compounds are limited to certain<br>
hues and their utilization within polyesters is suspect from a number of perspectives (such as<br>
toxicity, lightfastness, thermal stability, and the like). There is thus a desire to introduce new<br>
types of colorants comprising different types of chromophores for the purpose of providing<br>
new, effective, versatile colorants for such myriad end-uses as noted above and that exhibit<br>
excellent colorations, extraction, thermal stability, amine/base stability, compatibility with<br>
other coloring agents and/or polymer additives and/or substrates/resins/media, as well as low<br>
toxicity.<br>
In thermoplastics, particularly polyester, one approach to obtain the desired coloration<br>
has been to use difunctional dyes that possess the necessary pendant groups to allow them to<br>
be copolymerized, exemplified within U.S. Patent 4,403,092 to Davis et al. Though such a<br>
method provides effectively colored thermoplastics with good performance such as excellent<br>
extraction (due to the copolymerized nature of the dyes), good lightfastness, and the like,<br>
there are many drawbacks to such technology. Primarily, such drawbacks include that the<br>
colorants have to be added during the polymerization of polyesters thus the necessity of<br>
dedicating a high cost polyester production vessel to color due to the inherent and difficult-to-<br>
remedy contamination of the vessel by the colorant (which invariably limits flexibility in<br>
manufacturing of resins). Furthermore, another drawback is the necessity of the end user or<br>
article manufacturer to store large varieties of colored resins of different shades, thus limits<br>
the flexibility and adds cost to the end user. The colorants disclosed, for example within U.S.<br>
Patent 4,403,092, are inherently powdered or solid in nature and thus are not suitable for<br>
direct addition to the molten plastic during any injection molding step. Such powdered<br>
coloring agents are developed solely for actual polymerization within the target resin prior to<br>
any molding, injection, and other like process step. Drawbacks, thus, to these powdered types<br>
include undesirable dusting, contamination and staining of equipment, clogging (during<br>
feeding into the molten resin, for example), and poor control of metering during coloring of<br>
the target resin within and/or at the molding machinery. A more versatile colorant providing<br>
effective colorations when introduced at different steps during thermoplastic formation is thus<br>
highly desirable, particularly if these clean-up and contamination issues can be substantially<br>
avoided during utilization thereof. Other less noticeable drawbacks exist for such standard<br>
polyester coloring technology; however, these issues clearly show that improvements are<br>
highly desired, such as to provide easily handled liquid colorants for polyester which are<br>
thermally stable and offer excellent performance in areas such as extraction.<br>
Another approach to coloration of thermoplastics such as polyesters and namely<br>
polyethylene terephthalate has been through the use of pigments (Thomas G. Weber, Editor,<br>
Coloring of Plastics, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1979). The use of pigments (either<br>
neat or in a liquid dispersion), however, is accompanied by undesirable properties such as<br>
opacity, dullness of color, low tinctorial strength, and the like, associated with such pigment<br>
compounds and formulations. Also, difficulties in uniformly blending the insoluble pigments<br>
with the thermoplastic resin are encountered. In addition, with pigment dispersions,<br>
significant issues arise with transportation and storage due to the propensity for settling. Also<br>
there are problems with clean-ups due to the propensity of pigments for staining equipment<br>
(and possibly the personnel operating such equipment).<br>
Anthraquinone-based colorants have been known in the art for a long period of time<br>
and are widely used due to their high color strength, broad range of shades, and many are<br>
thermally stable and base stable. More specifically, 1,4-aromatic amino substituted<br>
anthraquinone blue colorants such as that shown in Comparative Example 20 [1,4-di-para-<br>
anisidino-anthraquinone], below, are known in the art and are disclosed in JP 05,330,254 to<br>
Takuma et al., as thermal-transfer recording dyes; and in JP 03,087,754 to Koshida et al., as<br>
color toner composition which provides high-quality cyan images with good lightfastness; in<br>
GB 1,489,239 and US 3,994,679 to Greenhalgh et al., as disperse dyestuffs for dyeing<br>
polyester textiles to give a marine blue shade; in U.S. Patent 3,653,800 to Blackwell to dye<br>
cotton or polyester-cotton textiles. However, no teaching or fair suggestion of a polymeric<br>
version of such a colorant is known, nor is it taught nor fairly suggested that such a colorant<br>
could be used for the coloration of thermoplastics such as PET or PP, or thermosets such as<br>
polyurethane. In addition, anthraquinone blue colorants such as l,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl<br>
arflino)-anthraquinone are disclosed in US 5,200,290, US 4,778,742 and US 4,645727 to Ong<br>
et al. Such colorants are to be used in reaction with diethyleneglycol bischlorofonnate,<br>
triethyleneglycol bischlorofonnate, and the like, to make solid blue polycarbonates, or with<br>
glutaryl chloride, adipoyl chloride, and the like, to make solid blue polyesters. The resultant<br>
blue polycarbonates or polyesters are then dissolved in isoparaffinic hydrocarbon etc to make<br>
blue liquid developer for image printing, or formulated with materials such as styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymer by melt blending techniques as blue toner compositions. Although this<br>
patent disclosed the blue- colored polyesters, the colorant itself is a solid small molecule and<br>
has to be copolymerized with other monomers during the formation of polyesters.<br>
Furthermore, there is no fair suggestion of blending l,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl amino)-<br>
anthraquinone with polyester or polycarbonate resins to form colored articles. A similar<br>
version such as a l,4-bis(2',6'-dimethyl-4'-substitutedphenyl amino)-anthraquinone dye was<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,918,976 to Arai et al, to color polyester film as photographic film<br>
support. Although the solid dyes were mixed with PET chips and the mixture was kneaded<br>
and formed into a film by melt extrusion, and the dyes suggested in US 3,18,976 showed<br>
improved sublimation resistance, it still significantly migrated to the surface of PET film and<br>
will not be able to use these version of dyes for other applications, particularly packaging et<br>
al. Furthermore, no fair mention is made of liquid polymeric derivatives of these colorants,<br>
nor is it taught nor fairly suggested that these colorants could be added during the molding<br>
step of polyester articles. Additionally, no teaching or fair suggestion of polymeric versions<br>
of such colorants with a poly(oxyalkylene) chain (or chains) are known, nor is it fairly taught<br>
any such polymeric colorants could be used to color thermosets such as polyurethanes. 1,4-<br>
Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl amino)-anthraquinone is also disclosed in JP 05,330,254 to Takuma, for<br>
utilization as a heat sensitive sublimation transfer recording cyan dye; in GB 2,071,681 to<br>
Whittaker to be dissolved in nonpolar fiuorinated organic liquids to color refrigerants,<br>
manometer indicator fluids, and the like; and in DE 2,123,454 to Neeff to be used to dye<br>
polyamide fibers and textiles. Meanwhile, GB 1,444,716 to Clark briefly mentioned the<br>
preparations of dyestuffs which contain mainly 1 -hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenylamino)-   <br>
anthraquinone with by-product l,4-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl animo)-anthraquinone as a minor<br>
component. As noted above, no fair mention is made of liquid polymeric derivatives of these<br>
colorants, nor is it taught nor fairly suggested that these colorants could be added during the<br>
molding step of polyester articles. Additionally, no teaching or fair suggestion of polymeric<br>
versions of such colorants with poly(oxyalkylene) chain or chains is known, nor is it fairly<br>
taught any such polymeric colorants could be used to color thermosets such as polyurethanes.<br>
To date, although some liquid colorants (other than less-than-reliable pigment<br>
dispersions) have been developed for such target end-uses, unfortunately, as noted above,<br>
they have also exhibited certain limitations. Improvements to such technology, such as a new<br>
polymeric liquid blue colorant based on anthranquinone that provides effective colorations for<br>
such myriad end-uses as noted above and that exhibit excellent colorations, lightfastness,<br>
thermal stability, base stability, compatibility with other coloring agents, and low toxicity, at<br>
least, is thus highly desired. Again, to date, there have been no teachings or fair suggestions<br>
of such a highly desirable, specific potentially polymeric liquid blue colorant within the<br>
pertinent prior art or within the colorant industry itself.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It has thus now been determined that poly(oxyalkylene) chains attached, through an aromatic amino group (or groups) to the 1- position, 4- position, or both, of an anthraquinone backbone provides such a needed and highly desired liquid blue colorant, particularly for utilization within thermoplastic and thermoset applications. It is thus an object of the invention to provide such a colorant exhibiting (at least) excellent colorations, low extraction, amine/base stability, thermal stability, and lightfastness within target thermoplastic and/or thermoset articles. Another object of this invention is to provide a blue polymeric colorant having at least one poly(oxyalkylene) chain attached thereto, wherein said polymeric colorant can be tailored for ease of processing, ease of mixing within target plastic media, and provides excellent colorations within the target finished articles. Yet another object of this invention is to provide excellent colorations within liquid compositions (such as inks, and the like) through the utilization of such water-soluble, blue liquid aromatic amino anthraquinone-based polymeric colorants, as noted above.<br>
It is to be understood that the term alkyl as used throughout is intended to encompass any straight or branched alkyl moiety, having anywhere from 1 to 30 carbons therein; the same chain length applies to the term "alkoxy" as well. Also, the terms substituted phenyl and substituted polyphenyl are intended to encompass any phenyl system having any type of pendant group attached thereto, including, without limitation, alkyl groups, alkylene groups,<br>
alcohol groups, ether groups, ester groups, amine groups, amide groups, hydroxyls, and the<br>
like. Phenyl is basically an unsubstituted ring system (and thus includes hydrogens only).<br>
The present invention preferably encompasses colorants conforming to the structure of<br>
Formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein A is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, and the structure of Formula (IT)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and B is selected from the group consisting of hydrogene, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, and the structure of Formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and wherein at least one of A and B is the structure of Formulas (II) or (III); wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, and Q-E, wherein Q is selected from the group consisting of N, O, S, SO2, SO3, CO2, SO2N, alkyl, and alkoxy, and E conforms to the structure of Formula (TV)<br>

Preferably, Q is O, E is a combination of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and z is 1.<br>
More specifically, and preferably, the inventive blue anthraquinone colorant conforms to the structure of (V)<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein Ri, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R6, R9, and R10 are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of C1-20 alkyi, halo, hydroxyl, hydrogen, cyano, sulfonyl, sulfo, sulfato, aryl, nitro, carboxyl, C1-20 alkoxy, and Q-E, wherein at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 is Q-E, and/or at least one of R6, R7, R8, R9, or R10 is Q-E, wherein Q is selected from the group consisting of N, O, S, SO2, SO3, CO, and E is represented by the Formula (VI)<br>

9 monomers of at least one C2-20 alkyleneoxy group, glydicol, glycidyl, or mixtures thereof, and<br>
R' is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-20 alkoxy, C1-20 alkyl, and C1-20 esters.<br>
Compositions comprising such compounds conforming to the broad structure of<br>
Formulae (I) and (V) are also encompassed within this invention, particularly those<br>
comprising such compounds and other coloring agents and other additives such as<br>
antioxidants, UV absorbers, flame retardants, light stabilizers, nucleating and/or clarifying<br>
agents, and the like, as liquids or as pellets for further introduction within desired molten<br>
thermoplastic formulations; and those compositions comprising such compounds and other<br>
coloring agents and other additives such as antioxidants, UV absorbers, flame retardants, light<br>
stabilizers, catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents, and the like, to effectuate the formation of<br>
thermosets such as polyurethane foams. Methods of making such compositions, particularly<br>
thermoplastics, such as PET and polypropylene, and thermosets such as polyurethane foam,<br>
comprising such compounds of Formulae (I) and (V), above, are also contemplated within<br>
this invention.<br>
The term "thermoplastic" is intended to encompass any synthetic polymeric<br>
material that exhibits a modification in physical state from solid to liquid upon exposure to<br>
sufficiently high temperatures. Most notable of the preferred thermoplastic types of materials<br>
arepolyolefins (i.e., polypropylene, polyethylene, and the like), polyester (i.e., polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, and the like), polyamides (i.e., nylon-1,1, nylon-1,2, nylon-6 or nylon-6,6),<br>
polystyrenes, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyvinyl halides (i.e., polyvinyl chloride and<br>
polyvinvyl difiuoride, as merely examples), and the bike. Preferred thermoplastics within this<br>
invention are polyesters, and most preferred is polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
Such thermoplastic articles include bottles, storage containers, sheets, films, fibers,<br>
plaques, hoses, tubes, syringes, and the like. Included within this fist would be polyester,<br>
polystyrene and other like resinous materials in sheet form which are present within windows<br>
for strength and resiliency functions. In such an instance, the inventive colorant compounds<br>
would provide or contribute to excellent colorations to such thermoplastic articles for<br>
decorative, aesthetic, and/or protective (such as ultraviolet or infrared protection) purposes.<br>
Basically, the possible uses for such a low-migratory, thermally stable colorant for such items<br>
as thermoplastics (particularly polyesters such as transparent polyethylene terephthalate) is<br>
voluminous and cannot easily be enveloped. Other possible end-uses, however, would include<br>
within solvent systems, printing inks, within and on textiles (either on or within textiles,<br>
fibers, or fabrics) and the like.<br>
Other types of articles contemplated within this invention for the inventive colorant<br>
compounds include, again without limitation, thermoplastic articles, such as films, sheets,<br>
bottles, containers, vials, and the like. Other colorants may be added to or incorporated<br>
therein with such inventive colorant compounds to produce different hues and tints, again for<br>
aesthetic, decorative, and/or protective purposes. Ultraviolet absorbers may also be<br>
introduced, incorporated, and the like, in order to protect the article or, if in container for, the<br>
contents therein. In concert with such an inventive colorant, or combinations of colorants<br>
with such an inventive colorant, such UV absorber or absorbers may be added in reduced<br>
amounts to provide the desired UV protection level, potentially, due to the inherent protective<br>
abilities of the colorant or combination thereof in terms of reducing ultraviolet transmissions<br>
(or inversely increasing ultraviolet absorption). Thus, such inventive colorants permit cost<br>
reductions (by avoiding the cost of larger amounts of expensive UV absorbers) without<br>
sacrificing UV protection.<br>
Such thermoplastic colorants (and other additives) are typically added to such<br>
compositions during the injection molding (or other type of molding, such as blow molding),<br>
thereof, including, and without limitation, by mixing the inventive liquid colorant with resin<br>
pellets and melting the entire coated pellets, or through a masterbatch melting step while the<br>
resin and the inventive colorant are pre-mixed and incorporated together in pellet form.  Such<br>
plastics include, again without limitation, polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes,<br>
polycarbonates, and other well known resins, such as those disclosed within U. S. Patents<br>
4,640,690, to Baumgartner et al., and 4,507,407, to Kluger et al. under the term<br>
"thermoplastics". Generally, such plastics, including the inventive liquid polymeric colorant,<br>
UV absorber, and other potential additives, are formed through any number of various<br>
extrusion, etc., techniques, such as those disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patents.<br>
Preferred thermoplastics are polyesters, such as, in one non-limiting embodiment,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate. "Plastic packaging" thus encompasses containers, sheets, blister<br>
packages, and the like, utilized for storage purposes and which include the plastics in any<br>
combination as noted above, m addition, these aforementioned U.S. patents also provide the<br>
same definition and scope of term "thennosets" as for the inventive coloring applications.<br>
The term "pure, undiluted state" as used in conjunction with the inventive colorant compounds indicates that the compounds themselves without any additives are liquid at room temperature or which thus encompasses all types that exhibit viscosities of at most 100,000 cps at room temperature or meet such viscosity limits upon exposure to temperatures of at most about 40Â°C and which remain within said low viscosity range thereafter for at least 24 hours upon cooling to room temperature. Thus, there is no need to add solvents, viscosity modifiers, and other like additives to the compounds to effectuate such a desirable physical state.<br>
The presence of surfactants, solvents, and the like, may be utilized to alter the solubility, coloring characteristics, and the like, of the ultimate inventive polymeric anthraquinone colorant which would be understood and appreciated by the ordinarily skilled artisan within this particular art.<br>
The colorant compounds of Formulae (I) and (V), above, are, again, liquid in their pure, undiluted state; however, pasty or waxy colorants are also encompassed within this invention, due to their handling improvement over clearly solid colorants of similar structures. In order to effectuate coloring of substrates and media, any other standard colorant additives, such as resins, preservatives, surfactants, solvents, antioxidants, flame retardants, antistatic compounds, antimicrobial agents, and the like, may also be utilized within the inventive colorant compound compositions or methods.<br>

Applications of Inventive Arvlamino Anthraquinone Blue Colorants in Plastics a) Thermoplastic Composition Formation in PET:<br>
In each instance noted below regarding PET application, the inventive polymeric liquind blue colorant was introduced within an injection molding operation for a polyester thermoplastic, in this instance polyethylene terephthalate (ClearTufÂ® 8006 PET resin from Shell). The inventive liquid colorant, in the amount noted in related examples, was blended via agitation onto the hot, dried polyethylene terephthalate resin (in pellet form). The blend of colorant and pellets was gravity fed into the feed throat of the machine. In the feed section, melting was accomplished through the utilization of a heated (heat transferred from the barrel of the machine) screw extruder which rotated. The rotation of the screw provided thorough mixing of the colorant and molten resin together producing a uniform plastic melt which was injected into a mold in order to form the thermoplastic article, for instance a 2 inch by 3 inch plaque with a uniform thickness of 50 mils and a surface area of 12.5 in .<br>

Performance Testing of Inventive Arylamino AO Blue Colorants<br>
a) Liehtfastness Testing of the Thermoplastic PET Composition:<br>
Ten plaques made according to Example 21 (which contained 100 ppm of the inventive colorant of Example 17) were collected from the standard injection molding operation.<br>
The color of the ten plaques collected from the standard operation was measured in both reflectance and transmittance on a Gretag-Macbeth Color-Eye 7000A Spectrophotometer and averaged together to represent the standard. Three sets of 2 plaques were then placed under xenon light for 10,20 and 40 hours exposure, respectively. Each set of the 2 plaques was collected after the designed hours of exposure and were measured individually and sequentially on the spectrophotometer. The color difference between the standard and the each of the 3 sets of plaques was determined by the ïEcmc. The bigger the ïEcmc. of the plaques, the larger the color difference and is determined to be worse the colorant's lightfastness.<br>
TABLE 1: Lightfastness of the Inventive Color Composition<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Under this protocol, an ïEcmc of at most 2 is highly desired.<br>
b) Thermoplastic Composition Formation for Intrinsic Viscosity Testing:<br>
The inventive colorant of Example 19 was introduced within a mixing operation for a polyester thermoplastic, for instance polyethylene terephthalate. The mixing was accomplished by the use of a C.W. Brabender Electronic Plasti-CorderÂ®, model number EPL-<br>
V5501, torque rheometer with a Type Six 2-piece mixer attachment. Cam style removable<br>
blades were used in the mixer attachment providing a medium shear-rate mixing. The<br>
temperature of the mixing chamber was set to 285Â°C and controlled via electric heating and<br>
air cooling.<br>
The liquid colorant was weighed into a small disposable syringe. The loading of the<br>
liquid colorant was adjusted based on the strength of the colorant. The hot, dried<br>
polyethylene terephthalate resin, specifically M &amp; G ClearTufÂ® 8006, in pellet form, was<br>
quickly weighed into a glass jar and sealed to minimize the adsorption of moisture by the<br>
resin. The torque rheometer mixing blades were turned on and set to a speed of 25 rpm as<br>
indicated by the digital display. A 25 ft3 /h flow of dried nitrogen gas was introduced mto the mixing chamber through the loading ram.<br>
The dried polyethylene terephthalate resin was poured into the mixing chamber and the loading ram was closed while the nitrogen gas continued to flow into the chamber. Simultaneously, a stopwatch was started to mark the beginning of the operation. After 1 minute and 30 seconds of mixing, the loading ram was raised and the liquid colorant was dispensed into the molten polyester resin. The loading ram was lowered and the liquid colorant was allowed to mix with the molten polyester resin for an additional 1 minute and 30 seconds.<br>
After such time, the blades were stopped and the loading ram was raised. The blades were reversed and a metal spatula was used to remove a sample of the molten, colored polyester from the mixing chamber. This molten sample was immediately compressed between two metal plates and allowed to cool to form the final thermoplastic disk.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the colored thermoplastic disk was measured according to ASTM D4603. The intrinsic viscosity of the colored thermoplastic disk was compared to the intrinsic viscosity of an uncolored thermoplastic control disk. The uncolored thermoplastic control disk was processed in the same manner as described above but without the addition of the liquid colorant. The reduction in the intrinsic viscosity of the colored thermoplastic disk can be expressed using the following equation:<br>
IV LoSScOLOR = IV UNCOLORED CONTROL ~ IVcOLORED DISK<br>
As a comparison, molded plaques containing pure ClearTintÂ® Cyan 486 (having a color value<br>
of 70 and commercially available from Milliken Chemical) were produced according to the<br>
same procedure. The color loading of the inventive colorant Example 19 was adjusted using<br>
the strength factor so the depth of shade was comparable to the ClearTintÂ® Cyan 486. For<br>
example, 1983 ppm of colorant from Example 19 in PET has equivalent depth of shade to<br>
5358 ppm of Cyan 486 in PET. The intrinsic viscosity results and comparisons are<br>
summarized in the following table:<br>
TABLE 2: Intrinsic Viscosity Loss in PET<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Thus, the inventive colorants exhibit significant improvements in IV loss in PET articles compared with existing commercial product.<br>
c) Thermal Stability Test of Inventive Blue in PET:<br>
Thermoplastic plaques of polyester terephthalate were produced as (injection molded).<br>
A total of ten plaques were then collected from the standard injection molding operation. The same injection molding machine used to produce these first ten plaques was then was paused during production of ten further plaques and allowed to remain idle for 15 minutes at the standard polyester processing temperatures (~277Â°C). At the end of the 15-minute pause, the machine was then restarted without purging the colored resin from the heated barrel of the machine. Ten consecutive plaques were then collected and numbered after resumption of the injection molding operation.<br>
The color of the ten plaques collected from the standard operation was measured in both reflectance and transmittance on a Gretag-Macbeth Color-Eye 7000A Spectrophotometer and averaged together to represent the standard. Each of the ten consecutive plaques collected after the 15-minute hold period were measured individually and sequentially on the<br>
TABLE 5: Extraction data for Inventive Colored PP Resins<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
An extraction level of 0.005 is considered to be acceptable in this application. Thus, the inventive colorants provided highly improved extraction levels.<br>
f) Performance Characteristics of Polvurethane Foams Including the Inventive Blue Colorants:<br>
The foams made in accordance with Examples 26, 27,28, and 29 were all tested for standard foam performance, in terms of bun rise time, tack time, and bun height. As one example, the foam of Example 27 was compared with the same noncolored polyether foam. Measurements within 5% of the control are considered acceptable for the finished foam product. The measurements were as follows:<br>
Table 6. Performance of Inventive Colored and Control Non-Colored Foams<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Thus, the inventive colorants provide acceptable polyurethane foam articles as compared with control samples.<br>
g) Extraction Measurements From Polvurethane Foams:<br>
The colored foam from Example 27, above, was analyzed for extraction levels as a percentage of color extracted being equal to the absorbance level of the extract solution multiplied by 539.2 and then divided by the color value of the colorant itself. The extraction test involved cutting 1 gram of the cured foam from the center of the sample and post-curing the cut foam for another 20 minutes (at 160Â°C in a glass jar). After cooling to room temperature, 75 grams of methanol were then added to the glass jar which was then capped for 1 hour. The foam was then removed and the extract liquor was analyzed under UV/Vis<br>
spectrophotometer for the maximum absorbtion. A percentage of less than 0.5% is<br>
considered acceptable. For the foam from Example 27, the measured absorption was<br>
measured to be 0.0370, and being well below the extraction level of 0.5, was therefore<br>
considered acceptable.<br>
h) Base Stability of Inventive Colorants<br>
0.1 g of ReactintÂ® Blue X3LV, inventive blue colorants from Example 15 and 16 were dissolved in 100 ml of pH 12 aqueous buffer solutions, the color strength was measured by UV-vis at 0, 4, and 8 hours. After 8 hours, the UV-vis spectra suggested that the color strength of the solutions containing inventive blue colorants of Examples 15 and 16 did not have meaningful change, while the color strength of the solution containing Blue X3LV was lost more than 80%.<br>
i) Amine Catalyst Stability of Inventive Colorants<br>
Three standard 1.5 lb/ft3 density polyether foams containing 1 g of inventive blue colorants from Examples 18 or 19, or ReactintÂ® Blue X3LV, respectively, were prepared according to the procedure described in Examples 26 and 27 (using 0.15 ml of the amine catalyst DABCO TL), immediately after the health bubble, the foams were placed in microwave for 10 min at 20% power and subsequently in a 160C oven for 3 min. The foams were then allowed to cool to ambient temperature and slice the bun vertically down the center and save the slices as the standard. The above processes were then repeated (still using the same amount of inventive blue colorants from Examples 18 or 19, or ReactintÂ® Blue X3LV, respectively) by using 0.68 ml of amine catalyst DABCO TL. Both respected foam slices (standard vs. the one made with high amine catalyst) were then compared reading in CMC for AE. An AE of greater than 1.0 suggests that the color loss has taken place and the respected colorant is not high amine catalyst stable. According to the above procedures, no color loss was observed for the inventive blues from Examples 18 and 19, whereas color loss was taken place for Reactint  Blue X3LV. This suggests that the inventive blue colorants are high amine catalyst stable.<br>
j) High TDI Index Stability of the Inventive Blue Colorants<br>
Three standard 1.5 lb/ft3 density polyether foams containing 1 g of inventive blue<br>
colorants from Examples 18 or 19, or ReactintÂ® Blue XI7, respectively, were prepared<br>
according to the procedure described in Examples 26 and 27 (using 37 ml of 80/20<br>
toluenediisocyanate from Bayer), immediately after the health bubble, the foams were placed<br>
in microwave for 10 min at 20% power and subsequently in a 160C oven for 3 min. The<br>
foams were then allowed to cool to ambient temperature and slice the bun vertically down the<br>
center and save the slices as the standard. The above processes were then repeated (still using<br>
the same amount of inventive blue colorants from Examples 18 or 19, or ReactintÂ® Blue X17,<br>
respectively) by using 57 ml of TDI. Both respected foam slices (standard vs. the one made<br>
with high amine catalyst) were then compared reading in CMC for AE. An AE of greater than<br>
1.0 suggests that the color loss has taken place and the respected colorant is not High TDI<br>
Index stable. According to the above procedures, no color loss was observed for the inventive<br>
blues from Examples 18 and 19, whereas color loss was taken place for ReactintÂ® Blue X17.<br>
This suggests that the inventive blue colorants are High TDI Index stable.<br>
k) Washabilitv of the Inventive Blue Colorants:<br>
After application of the colorant of Example 19 to polyester swatches of fabric, the colorants easily washed therefrom with minimal amounts of water and minimal abrasive contact. Thus, the colorants exhibit excellent washability.<br>
