				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polyurethane prepolymer for orthopedic synthetic casting tape which comprises an isocyanate terminated polyurethane prepolymer along with catalyst, stabilizer, antifoaming agent etc. embedded in a fiber matrix.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Plaster of Paris casts have been used to immobilize body members for some time. These bandages are made by depositing Plaster of Paris on a reinforcing scrim material such as gauze. When the Plaster of Paris is dipped in water, the alpha hemihydrate of calcium sulfate is converted to calcium sulfate dehydrate, which results in the hardening of the cast. Plaster of Paris casts, however, suffers from a number of disadvantages. Prolonged time of setting restricts the movement of the fractured part, X-ray transmission through the cast to determine whether a fracture has been properly set is very difficult. In addition, the cast is quite heavy and restricts the mobility of the patient cast, which may result in skin irritation beneath the cast.wearing the cast. The casts are also very sensitive to water and may seriously loose their load-bearing capacity if they become wet. In addition, the air permeability of the Plaster of Paris cast is very limited, and, as a result, they do not allow evaporation of moisture from the skin beneath the  A number of catalysts, though available to catalyze the water-isocyanate reaction of the prepolymer, are not suitable for use in a cast bandage due to their reactivity in packed condition with poor shelf stability.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of present invention is to propose a storage stable orthopedic cast bandage comprising water cross linkable polyurethane prepolymer resin based formulation impregnated in knitted glass or polypropylene tape substrate.<br>
Another object is to propose tape for use in orthopedics applications by dipping in water to activate the resin to harden.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided polyurethane prepolymer formulation for orthopaedics casting tape comprising a water-activatable polyurethane prepolymer resin mix impregnated in a knitted-weave fibrous substrate, said prepolymer comprising a prepolymer (A) having a aromatic diisocyanate, polyol and a solvent and a prepolymer (B) having a aromatic diisocyanate, a polyol and solvent in the ratio of from 10:90 to 90:10, 0.5% to 2% based on the weight of prepolymer, of dimorpholinodiethylether as a catalyst, 0.5% of stabilizer benzoyl chloride and 0.5% of antifoaming agent poly (dimethylesiloxane).<br>
The present invention relates to a polyurethane cast material, which comprises a fibrous substrate   impregnated with water activated polyurethane prepolymer, prepared using polyols and diisocynantes, stabilizers, cross linking catalysts and antifoaming agents etc. The polyols employed either difuctional or trifunctional aliphatic and/or aromatic polyether and/or polyester polyols. A molar excess of isocyanates and polyols are reacted to get the desired isocyanate terminated polyurethane prepolymer. Various stabilizers, catalysts and antifoaming ag used in the formulation. I n order to overcome the disadvantages of Plaster of Paris casts, numerous attempts have been made to develop plastic or plastic reinforced materials as a replacement for Plaster of Paris. U.S. Patent nos. 3,241,501 and 3,881.473 disclose casts, which are made with, a flexible fabric impregnated with a polymer which is capable of being cured by ultraviolet light. Although this casting material overcomes some of the disadvantages of Plaster of Paris cast material, it requires a different technique in its application and also requires the use of the ultraviolet light source in order to cure the cast. These casts also require significantly longer time for the cast to set before they will be load bearing.<br>
More recent attempts to produce substitutes for Plaster of Paris include the polyurethane polymers disclosed in German Offenlegenschrift nos. 2353212 and 2357931, U.K. Patent no. 1,578,895 and PCT application no. W081/00671. These bandages are open-weave fabrics coated with polyurethane prepolymers. that is, reaction products of isocyanates and polyols. The bandages are dipped into water in the same manner as the Plaster of Paris and then applied to the limb of a patient. The water causes the prepolymer to polymerize and form a rigid polymer structure. In order to obtain the desired rapid hardening or setting of the bandage, it is necessary to have a catalyst system incorporated in the prepolymer formulation. The casting material disclosed in U.K. Patent no. 1,578,895 employs amino polyols as catalysts and as the polyol components. The casting material disclosed in W081/00671 employs dimethyl ethanolamine (DMEA) or a mixture of DMEA and bis (2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether. These catalyst systems provide acceptable time of heardening by catalyzing the water-isocyanate reaction. However, the presence of these catalysts in the prepolymer system result in short shelf life in the bandage package. The inadequate shelf stability makes the cast difficult to bandage. Cast bandage of shelf life more the 12 months, are yet to be available commercially.<br>
A number of catalysts, though available to catalyze the water-isocyanate reaction of the prepolymer, are not suitable for use in a cast bandage due to their reactivity in packed condition with poor shelf stability.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of present invention is to propose a storage stable orthopedic cast bandage comprising water cross linkable polyurethane prepolymer resin based formulation impregnated in knitted glass or polypropylene tape substrate.<br>
Another object is to propose tape for use in orthopedics applications by dipping in water to activate the resin to harden.<br>
