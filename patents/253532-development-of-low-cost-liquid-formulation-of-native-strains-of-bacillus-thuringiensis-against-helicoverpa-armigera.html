				<td>Field of Invention;<br>
The invention relates to the development of low cost liquid formulation of native strains of Bacillus thuringiensis against Helicoverpa arrnigera.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
H. armigera, a major pest of various cropplants worldwide has developed resistance against chemicals. Therefore there is a need to explore BT formulations so that losses due to this pest could be minimized. The formulation should be viable at high temperatures prevailing in that area. The bioinsecticides formulation in controlling Helicoverpa armigera larvae in the local area are mainly imported from Europe and China. The formulations available in market is very costly which increases the cost of input. The formulations available do not contain the native strains, so are less effective. Also these formulations cannot tolerate high temperature in the field and hence are less persistent in the field.<br>
Low cost Agro industrial byproducts are used for the production of Bacillus thuringiensis formulations. Therefore the cost of production is 7-9 times lower than the previously available formulations. Since the native strains are used for the preparation of these formulations, they are more effective in controlling the pests in local area. Also as the native strains are isolated from the fields of local area, they can resist the high temperature prevailing in the area.<br><br>
Objects of Invention;<br>
The object of this invention is to control the Helicoyerpa armigera larvae in the local area.<br>
Other object is to prepare liquid formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis strains Btm and Se.<br>
Another objection is to use the native strains for making effective formulations.<br>
Yet another object is to use a formulation that can tolerate high temperature in the field.<br>
Another object is to make a formulation that is persistent in the field.<br>
Other object is to develop a formulation wherein the cost of production is much lower than the previously available formulations.<br>
Statement of the Invention;<br>
According to this invention there is provided a low cost liquid formulation of native strains of Bacillus thuringiensis BtIII and S6 against Helicoverpa armigera, the stabilizing agent used being sterile mustard oil preferably 100 ml and non food grade starch @ of 0.01% as a spreading material before spraying wherein the Bacillus thuringiensis strains are grown on production media containing 2-14 ml/litre potato extract as carbon source, 2-14 gm/litre cotton seed meal as nitrogen source, 0.5 g/1 - 2.5 g/1, preferably 2.0 gm peptone, 0.5 g/1 - 2.5 g/1 preferably 1.5 g Dextrose, 0.5 g/1 - 2.5 g/1 preferably 2.0 gm yeast extract, 0.03 gm MgSO4, 7H2O, .02g FeSO4, 7H2O, .02g ZnSO4, 7H2O, 5.0g Nacl, 1rnl<br><br>
Tween 60 and distilled water to make volume to 1 litre for 48 hrs at 30-<br>
40°C preferably at 30°C and harvested cells are poured into the bottle<br>
containing mustard oil, so that each bottle has got ~1012 cells/100 ml of<br>
liquid.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying Figures;<br>
The figure 1 shows the effect of different nitrogen sources on the growth of B. thuringiensis strain.<br>
The figure 2 shows the effect of different carbon sources on the growth of B. thuringiensis strain.<br>
The figure 3 shows that 1012 cells/g of carrier material showed the highest viability of cells.<br>
The figure 4 shows that Evaluation of persistence of B. thuringiensis Btm cells in different stabilizers based liquid formulations.<br>
The figure 5 shows that Persistence of Bt cells in mustard oil based<br>
formulation.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention;<br>
The formulation is prepared by using native strains of Bacillus thuringiensis i.e. Btm and Se. The stabilizing material used for the liquid formulation is Mustard Oil. Non food grade starch @ 0.01% is added as a spreading material before spraying.<br>
Low cost production medium for Bacillus thuringiensis contained potato extract 12 ml/1, cotton seed meal 10 gm/1, peptone 2 g/1, Dextrose 1.5 g/1, yeast extract 2.0 g/1, MgSO4, 7H2O .03 g/1, FeSO4, 7H2O 0.02 g/1, ZnSO4, 0.02 g/1, Nacl 5.0 g/1, Tween 60, 1.0 ml/1. The production medium was inoculated with Bt native strains in the Erlenmeyer flasks<br><br>
as well as in the Roux bottles. The Biomass obtained after 48 hours of growth was collected for preparing the liquid formulation of Bt. One hundred milliliter of mustard oil was put in autoclavable plastic bottles for preparation of the liquid formulation. These bottles were sterilized at 15 1b/sq inch for 20 minutes. The biomass of Bt obtained after 48 hours was poured into the bottles such that each bottle should get 1012 cell/ml of the liquid. These formulations were kept at room temperature. The bioefficacy of these formulations were determined by applying these formulations in the fields infested with Helicoverpa armigera and the bio efficacy was determined by calculating % larval mortality.<br>
Various Agro industrial residues &amp; their concentrations used in the formulation<br>
For biomass production of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, different agro-industrial by-products viz. potato extract, corn starch, wheat flour, sugarcane molasses, barley flour, soluble starch (carbon source) cotton seed meal, soya meal, sunflower meal, urea, ammonium sulfate and potassium nitrate(nitrogen source) were used as carbon and nitrogen sources (Table 1, 2)<br>

The concentration of carbon &amp; nitrogen sources varied from 2g to 14 grams in basal medium (Table 3)<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
*log number of total viable cells<br>
The concentration of MgSO4.7H2O, FeSO4.7H2O, ZnSO4.7H2b, NaCl, Tween 60 was taken @ 0.003%, 0.002%, 0.002%, 0.5% and 0.1% respectively as per recommendation of Morris et. al. (1997) for the basal medium for the growth of B. thuringiensis isolates.<br>

*log number of total viable cells<br>
** potato extract was added @10ml/l in all the media except LB<br>
From these studies, it is clear that potato extract and cotton seed meal were the best carbon and nitrogen sources respectively, for maximum biomass production. The composition of optimized medium for production of Bt. Biomass is given below (Table-6).<br>

Harvesting of cells/Centrifugation for the preparation of Bt culture packets<br>
Production of Bt biomass;<br>
The Bt cultures were inoculated into OPM   in Roux bottles or in flasks and incubated at 30°C for 48 hours.<br>
From Roux bottles, cells were harvested by scraping off the cells with<br>
sterilized distilled water using a glass rod.<br>
Cells from culture broth in flasks, were harvested by two methods.<br>
i)        Cells  were  collected  by  centrifugation  at   10,000  rpm  for   10 minutes<br>
ii)       To culture broth, bentonite: agar mix (1:1) @ 0.1%    was added aseptically and kept for 24 h. at room temperature. Cells settled down, culture supernatant was removed by decanting off, cells were collected and absorbance was measured. The cell suspension was injected aseptically into each packet at a concentration of ~1012 cells/g of the carrier material. The contents of the culture packets were mixed thoroughly to prevent clump formation. The cells were used as 1012 cells/g of carrier material so that the final spray suspension would contain 108 cells/ml of the spray suspension (international standard).<br>
Tolerance at High temperature<br>
The growth of B. thuringiensis Btm and standard culture B. thuringiensis subsecies kurstaki (isolated from Dipel) were examined at different temperatures viz. 30°C, 35°C, 40°C. It was observed that both the strains showed same growth at 30°C. But at 35°C and 40 °C, the growth of B. thuringiensis subsecies kurstaki was less than 50 % in terms of biomass as compared to B. thuringiensis Btm •<br>
