A METHOD OF TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING CONTROL<br>
INFORMATION FOR POINT-TO-MULTIPOINT MULTIMEDIA MULTICAST<br>
SERVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of transmitting and receiving<br>
broadcast information, and more particularly, to a method of transmitting and receiving<br>
broadcast information for point-to-multipoint service.<br>
Background Art<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a network structure of a Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication System (UMTS) according a conventional art. More specifically,<br>
the UMTS comprises a User Equipment (UE), a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access<br>
System (UTRAN), and a Core Network (CM). The UTRAN further comprises more<br>
than one Radio Network Sub-systems (RNS) and each RNS comprises a Radio Network<br>
Controller (RNC) and at least one base station (Node B) which is managed by the RNC.<br>
Moreover, each Node B comprises at least one cell. Hereafter, the UE can be<br>
alternatively referred to as a mobile terminal, a mobile station, a terminal, to name a few.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a Radio Interface Protocol between the UE and<br>
the UTRAN based on a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) wireless access<br>
network standard. As illustrated in Figure 2, the Radio Interface Protocol comprises,<br>
horizontally from bottom up, a physical layer, a data link layer, and network layer. In<br>
addition, the Radio Interface Protocol comprises, vertically from left to right, a control<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	2	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
plane for transmitting control signals and a user plane for transmitting data. Furthermore,<br>
the protocol layers can be classified into Layer 1 (L1), Layer 2 (L2), and Layer (3)<br>
which is based on bottom three layers of an Open System Interconnection (OSI).<br>
L1 or the physical layer uses a physical channel to provide Information Transfer<br>
Service to the upper layer. Structurally, the physical layer is connected to a Medium<br>
Access Control (MAC) layer via a transport, channel through which data is transferred.<br>
At the same time, data transmission between the transmission end and the receiving end<br>
of the physical layer take places through the physical channel.<br>
The MAC layer of L2 uses a logical channel to transfer information to higher<br>
layer or a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer. The RLC layer can support reliable data<br>
transmission and can perform segmentation and/or concatenation on a Service Data Unit<br>
(SDU) transferred from higher layer.<br>
A Radio Resource Control (RRC) of L3 is operational only in the control plane,<br>
The RRC controls configuration, re-configuration, and release of a Radio Bearer (RB)<br>
in relation to the logical channel, transmission channel, and physical channel Here, the<br>
RB represents service(s) provided from L2 between the UE and the UTRAN for data<br>
transmission. A configuration of the RB generally signifies specific characteristic of the<br>
protocol layer(s) and channel(s) necessary for providing a specified service and<br>
configuration of parameters and operational schemes.<br>
A detailed description of a Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS)<br>
will be explained. The MBMS uses a MBMS bearer service to provide streaming or<br>
background services to a plurality of UEs. The MBMS service comprises at least one<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	3	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
session, and the MBMS data is transmitted only during the operation of the session<br>
through the bearer service.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a structural diagram of a MBMS service from the perspective<br>
of the UE according to the conventional art. As illustrated in Figure 3, the UTRAN uses<br>
the RB to provide the MBMS bearer service to the UE. Here, the RBs can be<br>
represented with two types, namely, a point-to-point RB and a point-to-multipoint RB.<br>
Here, the point-to-point KB is a bi-directional RB and is comprised of a logical channel<br>
(i.e., Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH)), a transmission channel (i.e., Dedicated<br>
Channel (DCH)), and a physical channel (i.e., Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH) or<br>
Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (SCCPCH)). Moreover, the point-to-<br>
multipoint RB is uni-directional downlink RB. and as illustrated in figure 3, is<br>
comprised of a logical channel (i.e., MBMS traffic Channel (MTCH)), a transmission<br>
channel (i.e., Forward Access Channel (FACH), and a physical channel (i.e., SCCPCH).<br>
More specifically, the logical channel MTCH is configured during each MBMS service<br>
provided to the cell and is used provide user plane data to a plurality of UEs.<br>
Furthermore, a logical channel MBMS Control Channel (MCCH) is a point-to-<br>
multipoint downlink channel used to transmit MBMS related control information. The<br>
logical channel MCCH is mapped to a Forward Access Channel (FACH), and the<br>
FACH is mapped to the SCCPCH. In addition, one MCCH exists per each cell.<br>
The conventional art related to the discussion above has following shortcomings.<br>
In the conventional art, in order for the UTRAN to transmit a large amount of<br>
information on the MCCH during a single modification period, the UTRAN increased a<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	4	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
transmission rate of the MCCH or simple extended the transmission period. However, if<br>
the MCCH transmission rate is increased, Node B consumes more power, and at the<br>
same time, modification of the MCCH information can be delayed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of transmitting and<br>
receiving control information for point-to-multipoint multimedia multicast service that<br>
substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of receiving broadcast<br>
information from a network is; a wireless commuunication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of transmitting<br>
broadcast information to a mobile terminal from a network in a wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of acquiring<br>
service information.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in<br>
part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	5	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the<br>
purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method receiving<br>
broadcast information from a network in a wireless communication system includes a<br>
mobile terminal for receiving information of a specified number of groups and receiving<br>
a plurality of messages according to the information of the specified number of groups,<br>
wherein each message corresponds to each time interval. Furthermore, the mobile<br>
terminal is included in the system for acquiring the broadcast information from the<br>
received plurality of messages.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method of transmitting broadcast<br>
information to a mobile terminal from a network in a wireless communication system is<br>
disclosed, in the method. the network groups a plurality o1 information into a specified<br>
number of groups and allocates each of the specified groups to a time interval.<br>
Thereafter, the network transmits information of the specified number of groups to the<br>
mobile terminal and transmits a plurality of messages, wherein each message<br>
corresponds to each time interval.<br>
Yet, in another aspect of the present invention, a method of receiving broadcast<br>
information from a network in a wireless communication system is described. More<br>
specifically, the network receives through a control channel a plurality of messages,<br>
wherein a first message includes information of a specified number of groups, and<br>
subsequent messages include a list of elements allocated to each group, Moreover, the<br>
network receives subsequent message, wherein each subsequent message corresponds to<br>
each time interval and acquires the broadcast information from the received subsequent<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	6	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
messages.<br>
In further aspect of the present invention, a method of acquiring service<br>
information is described. More specifically, a mobile terminal receives a plurality of<br>
message during at least one modification period and stores contents of the plurality of<br>
messages. Furthermore, the mobile terminal acquires a length of the modification period<br>
from the stored plurality of messages, wherein the length of the modification period is<br>
an integer greater than '0' and terminates reception of the plurality of messages when<br>
the length of the modification period equals '0.'<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory<br>
and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example of a MCCH information transmission scheme.<br>
The MCCH is an example of broadcast information. More specifically, the UTRAN,<br>
which provides the MBMS service, transmits MCCH information to a plurality of UEs<br>
via the MCCH. The MCCH information is transmitted periodically according to a<br>
modification period and a repetition period. Moreover, the MCCH information can be<br>
classified into critical information and non-critical information. Accordingly, the non-<br>
critical information can be freely modified for transmission during every modification<br>
period and repetition period. On the contrary, the critical information can only be<br>
modified during the modification period. In other words, the critical information is<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	8	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
transmitted once per each repetition period, and the modified critical information can<br>
only be transmitted at start of the modification period.<br>
In addition, the MCCH information refers to MBMS and related control<br>
message (e,g., related RRC message). The MCCH information includes a MBMS<br>
Modified Services Information (MSI), a MBMS Unmodified Services Information<br>
(USI), and a point-to-multipoint KB information, and access information. Among these<br>
MCCH information, the access information message can be categorized as non-critical<br>
information, while the other messages can be categorized as critical information.<br>
When the UTRAN transmits all of messages included in the MCCH information,<br>
and if the message includes information related to a specified service, then a MBMS<br>
transmission identity is included in the- message. In detail, the MBMS transmission<br>
identity comprises a MBMS session identity and a MBMS service identity. When the<br>
UTRAN transmits the MBMS MSI message, the message contains the MBMS<br>
transmission identity and information related to service(s) corresponding to the<br>
transmission identity.<br>
Furthermore, the UTRAN periodically transmits data via a MBMS Notification<br>
Indicator Channel (MICH), as illustrated in Figure 3. Here, the data contains<br>
information pertaining to whether the MCCH information is updated during the<br>
modification period. If the UE wishes to receive only a certain MBMS service, then the<br>
UE does not receive data via the MCCH nor the MTCH prior to start of the service of<br>
that particular session but instead receives the data via the MICH periodically. In the<br>
description of the present application, updating the MCCH information refers to<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	9	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
generating, adding, modifying, or removing a specific item from the MCCH<br>
information.<br>
In order to notify whether the MCCH information is updated during the<br>
modified period, the UTRAN transmits data via the MICH and the MSI message. The<br>
MSI message includes the identity information of all the services of the current cell<br>
being modified during the corresponding modification period as well as operation-<br>
related information for the UEs subscribed to the corresponding service(s). As identify<br>
information, the MBMS transmission identity is used. Here, the MBMS transmission<br>
identity can be comprises of the MBMS service identity for instructing a specific<br>
service and/or the MBMS session identity for instructing a specific session of a<br>
particular service can be combined with ui the MBMS service identity.<br>
In addition, the identity information of the services unmodified during the<br>
modification period can be transmitted via the USI message. Here, the MBMS<br>
transmission identity of the corresponding service is used as the identity information.<br>
When the specific MBMS service session is activated, the UTRAN transmits a<br>
Notification Indicator (NI) via the MICH. The NI indicates to the UE wishing to receive<br>
the specific MBMS service to receive data from the MCCH. After receiving the NI via<br>
the MICH, the UE receives the data on the MCCH daring the specified modification<br>
period as indicated in the NI. "While receiving the data on the MCCH, the UE receives<br>
the MSI message to first determine whether the MBMS service it wishes to receive has<br>
been modified during the corresponding modification period. At this time, if the MBMS<br>
service has been modified, then the UE acquires the modified MCCH information. As<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	10	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
for the UE, the UE receives the MSI message and the USI message transmitted during a<br>
modification period and can compile a list of all the services provided in the current cell<br>
during the corresponding modification period.<br>
If the UE wishes to receive a certain MBMS service by using the point-to-<br>
multipoint RB, then the UE can receive the MCCH information, which includes the RB<br>
information, on the MCCH and use the received MCCH information to assign the point-<br>
to-multipoint RB to the UE. After the UE completes configuring the point-to-multipoint<br>
RB, the UE can continue to receive data on the SCCPCH, to which the MTCH is<br>
mapped, and acquire the data of the MBMS service transmitted on the MTCH.<br>
The UTRAN can transmit data discontinuously on the MTCH. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 3, the UTRAN can. periodically transmit a scheduling message to the UK on a<br>
MBMS scheduling channel (MSCH) of the SCCPCH. Here, the scheduling message<br>
provides a transmission start point and a transmission period of the MBMS data which<br>
is transmitted during a scheduling period. To this end, the UTRAN should provide in<br>
advance a scheduling period of the scheduling information to the UB.<br>
Table 1 shows a composition of the MSI and USI messages absent service<br>
modification according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	11	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
[Table 1]<br><br>
In fhe embodiment of the present invention, the USI message can be modified during<br>
every USI Period (UP), and the MSI message can be modified during every MSI Period<br>
(MP). The length of the UP is S times the length of the MP. According to Table I, the<br>
length of the UP is three (3) times in length than that of the MP. Here, S is three (3). In<br>
other words, one (1) UP includes three (3) MPs. In addition, the lengths of the UP and<br>
the MP can be represented in time intervals. These time intervals can be of same length<br>
or of different Lengths.<br>
As illustrated by Table 1, information of unmodified services are categorized and<br>
grouped into one of three MPs. Unlike the conventional art where the USI message<br>
transmits all information Telated to all of the unmodified services in a single MP, the<br>
USI message according to the embodiment of the present invention transmits a part (or<br>
a specified portion) of the information of the unmodified services. To accomplish this,<br>
all of the MBMS services currently in session in the corresponding cell is divided into S<br>
number of groups (e.g., G1, G2, G3), and each group is allocated to a different MP.<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	12	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
Again, S number of MPs comprises a UP.<br>
For example, the services can be grouped in a manner such that Services 1-5<br>
belong to G1, Services 6-10 belong to G2, and Services 11 - 14 belong to G3. More<br>
specifically, referring to Table 1, Services 1 - 5 are allocated to MP#1 of UP#1,<br>
Services 6 - 10 are allocated to MP#2 of UP#1, and Services 11-14 are allocated to<br>
MP#3 of UP#L If a certain .service is allocated to a specific MP of a UP, then that<br>
particular allocation can be applied to subsequent XJPs in a same manner. Moreover,<br>
such allocation is maintained until termination of the session of the corresponding<br>
service,<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the UTRAN transmits<br>
the MSI and USI message including foe service information of the corresponding cell<br>
to the UE. Before the MSI and USI messages can be received, the UE acquires<br>
information related to S number of groups. Thereafter, the UE receives a plurality of the<br>
messages consecutively according to S number of groups. Here, each of the MSI or the<br>
USI message corresponds to a time interval or put differently, the length of the period.<br>
Table 1 illustrates a scenario where there is no modification or change in any of<br>
the MPs. That is, as illustrated in Table 2, there is no modification (e.g., the MSI<br>
message is empty) in MP#1 through MP#6. As such, the service information are<br>
included in the USI message and not in the MSI message since there is no modification<br>
to the service. Here, the services (e.g., Service 1, Service 8, Service 14) represent<br>
information that is transmitted in the MSI message and/or the USI message in a<br>
particular MP/UP.<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	13	PCT/KR2006/00114I<br>
Alternatively, Table 2 illustrates a scenario where service modifications are<br>
indicated in each MP except in MP#5.<br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
As is the case in the conventional art, if modification or change to the<br>
corresponding service information is indicated in a specific MP, the MSI message<br>
transmitted in the specific MP. That is, the MSI message includes service identity<br>
information of modified service information regardless which service group (e.g., G\,<br>
G2, G3) the service information is included. However, the USI message transmitted in<br>
the specific MP does not include the modified service information, but only the service<br>
information of the unmodified services allocated to that specific MP.<br>
For example, referring to Table 2, modifications to service information are<br>
indicated by Service 2 and Service 8 of MP#1. In addition, modifications to service<br>
information are indicated by Services 2,3, and 5 of MP#2, while further modifications<br>
to service information are indicated by Services 11 and 14 of MP#3. In MP#1, since<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	14	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
Service 2 information is already allocated to MP#1, modified service information<br>
related to Service 2 is not included in the USI message of MP#1 but only in the MSI<br>
message of MP#1. Furthermore, since Service 8 information is allocated to MP#2,<br>
modified service information related to Service 8 is included in MSI message of MP#1,<br>
and the unmodified Service 8 information in included in the USI message of MP#2.<br>
Here, unless Sendee 8 information is modified again in the subsequent period (i.e.,<br>
MP#2), Service 8 information is unmodified and included as allocated.<br>
In MP#2, since modification to Service 2 information is indicated in MP#2. the<br>
modified Service 2 information is included in the MSI message of MP#2. Even though<br>
Service 2 information is allocated to MP#1, Service 2 information is not included the<br>
USI message of MP#1 because Service 2. information is modified in MP#1. The-<br>
modified service information is included in the MSI message of the corresponding MP,<br>
In MP#3, since Service 11 and 14 information are already allocated in MP#3,<br>
their modified service information are included in the MSI message, and the remaining<br>
Services 12 and 13 information are included in the USI message since they are not<br>
modified.<br>
With respect to UP#2, modifications to Services 10 information and Service 12<br>
information are indicated in MP#4, and modifications to Service 8 information and<br>
Service 12 information are further indicated in MP#6. As such, these modified service<br>
information are included in the MSI message of the corresponding MPs. Here, since the<br>
modified Service 10 information is indicated in MP#4, the modified service information<br>
is included in the MSI message of MP#4, and at the same time, the modified Service 10<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	15	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
information is included in the USI message of MP#5 as already allocated. In addition,<br>
since modified Service 12 information is included in MP#4 and MP#6, this service is<br>
included in the MSI of the corresponding MPs. Moreover, because the modified Service<br>
12 information is included in the MSI message of MP#6, it is not included in the USI<br>
message of MP#6. Lastly, modified Service 8 information is indicated in MP#6, and as<br>
such, the modified Service 8 information is included in the MSI message of MP#6 as<br>
well as in the USI message of allocated MP#5.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the MCCH information transmitted<br>
during every modified period only transmits information of services included in the<br>
MSI and USI messages in the corresponding modification period. For instance, the<br>
messages transmitted on the MCCH (e.g., MBMS point-to-multipoint KB information,<br>
MBMS general information, MBMS access information - also referred to as MCCH<br>
information) includes only the MCCH information associated with Services 8, 11, 12,<br>
13, and 14 transmitted via the MSI and USI messages in MP#6. As another embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the information transmitted on the MCCH during each<br>
modification period can include MCCH information of all the services in the UP to<br>
which the UE belongs.<br>
Table 3 illustrates an example of how specific service information is transmitted<br>
when the session of the specific service is initiated or terminated.<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	16	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
[Table 3]<br><br>
When a session of a particular service is activated, the UTRAN allocates the<br>
particular service to a group. Thereafter, the UTRAN includes the service identity of the<br>
particular service in the MSI message of a specific MP. In addition, the UTRAN also<br>
includes the service identity of the particular service in the USI message of a MP to<br>
which the particular service is allocated. If the MP of the MSI message is identical to<br>
the MP of the USI message, the service identity of the particular service is only<br>
included in the MSI message of the MP.<br>
As illustrated in Table 3, if start of Service 15 session takes place in MP#2, the<br>
UTRAN includes Service 15 information in the MSI message of MP#2, and the service<br>
identity of Service 15 is included in the USI message of a first group to which Service<br>
IS information is allocated within one UP. Since the session of Service 15 starts in<br><br>
WO 20006/104343	17	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
MP#2, Service 15 information is not included in MP#1 but included in the USI message<br>
starting from MP#4.<br>
With respect to the session of Service 17 starting from MP#2, Service 17<br>
information is included in the MSI message of MP#2. Furthermore, since the UTRAN<br>
has allocated Service 17 information to a second group (i.e., MP#2, MP#5) of the UP,<br>
Service 17 information is included in the MSI. message of MP#5.<br>
As for the session of Service 16 starting in MP#4, Service 16 information is<br>
included in the MSI message of MP#4, Furthermore, since the UTRAN has allocated<br>
Service 16 information to a third group (i.e., MP#3, MP#6) of the UP, Sendee 16<br>
information is included in the MSI message of MP#6.<br>
However, if termination of the session of Service 3 is indicated in MP#2, the<br>
UTRAN includes Service 3 in the MSI message of MP#2, and removes Service 3<br>
information from the first group (i.e., MP#1) to which Service 3 is originally allocated.<br>
After the removal, Service 3 information is no longer transmitted in subsequent<br>
corresponding MPs. However, since Service 3 is allocated to the first group (i.e., MP#1),<br>
identity information of Service 3 is included in the USI message of MP#1.<br>
Additionally, if termination of the session of Service 11 is indicated in MP#3,<br>
the UTRAN includes Service 11 information in the MSI message of MP#3, and<br>
removes Service 11 information from the third group to which Service 1 is originally<br>
allocated After the removal, Service 11 information is no longer transmitted in<br>
subsequent MPs. For example, as shown in Table 3, after the session termination of<br>
Service 11 in MP#3, subsequent corresponding MPs, namely, MP#6 does not include<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	18	PCT/KR20O6/0OH41<br>
Service 11. However, since Service 3 is pre-allocated to the first group, identity<br>
information of Service 3 is included in the USI message of MP#1.<br>
Furthermore, if termination of the session of Service 10 is indicated in MP#4,<br>
the UTRAN includes Service 10 information in the MSI message of MP#4, and<br>
removes Service 10 information from the second group to which Service 10 is originally<br>
allocated. After the removal, Service 10 information is no longer transmitted in<br>
subsequent corresponding MPs.<br>
-When a group of identify information is used in the MSI message, information<br>
about all services belonging to the group may be included in the USI message, because<br>
all available MBMS service identities may be broadcasted during a modification period<br>
to support UEs that come from other cells. Thus, if UFs/. come from. other cell, the, UEs<br>
may interpret the transmission group identity after receiving the USI as well as the MSI<br>
messages.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a process of acquiring service information by the UE<br>
according to the present invention. In the embodiment of the present invention, the UE<br>
has to receive the MSI message and the USI message for the entire duration of the UP in<br>
order to fully acquire service information of a specified cell. The UE receives the<br>
messages during the entire UP to acquire all service information of the cell when the UE<br>
moves to a different cell, first activates the MBMS service, or error occurs in managing<br>
' the service information. After all the service information is received, the UE can receive<br>
the MSI message only to determine the status of service information. Here, absent<br>
movement or mobility of the UE, there is no need to perform the above<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	19	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
operations/processes.<br>
With respect to the service information acquisition process of the UE, the<br>
UTRAN transmits a length of the UP on a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) or on the<br>
MCCH to the UE. If the length of the UP is transmitted on the MCCH, the UTRAN can<br>
use any one of the MSI message and the USI message, which are transmitted<br>
periodically, to transmit the length of the UP. Preferably, the length of the UP should be.<br>
included in the USI message, and if the length of the UP is modified/changed, the<br>
modified length of the UP should be included in the MSI message.<br>
A detailed description of Figure 5 is as follows. In order to fully acquire service<br>
information of a specific cell, the UE receives information via the MCCH and receives<br>
the MSI message and the USI message during specified modification period(s). Then,<br>
the UE stores the contents of the MSI and the USI messages (e.g., service information).<br>
Using the MSI and USI messages, the length of the UP can be acquired. Here, the<br>
length of the UP can be expressed as SI, and a value of SI corresponds to multiple(s) of<br>
the modification period. The UE stores the value of SI, and m is set to S1 (m = S1)<br>
(S10).<br>
Subsequently, the UE receives the MSI message and the USI message during the<br>
subsequent modification period and stores the contents of the MSI and USI messages.<br>
Using the MSI message or the USI message, the UE acquires the length of the UP. Here,<br>
the UP can be expresses as S2 and a value of S2 corresponds to multiple(s) of the<br>
modification period. At this time, m is set to m-1 (m=m -1) (S20).<br>
After S20, the UE determines whether the value of S2 is identical to the value of<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	20	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
S1 (S30). If the value of S2 is different than that of S1, the UE sets a different S1 value<br>
by replacing the valueof S1 with the value of S2. The replaced value of S1 is stored and<br>
m is reset to S1. The UE then deletes or removes all of the previously stored MSI and<br>
USI messages except for the most recently stored MSI and USI messages (i.e., MSI and<br>
USI messages of the current MP). Thereafter, the UE re-executes the operation of S20.<br>
Alternatively, if the value of S2 is identical to the value of SI, then the. UE<br>
further determines whether the value of m is '0.' If the value of m does not equal '0,'<br>
then the UE re-executes the operation of S20 (S50). If, however, the value of m equals<br>
'0' then it signifies that the stored MSI and USI messages include all the service<br>
information of the corresponding cell, and that there is no more service information that<br>
needs to be received in connection with the corresponding cell (S60).<br>
Figure 6 is a structural diagram of a wireless communication device that<br>
performs the operation of the present invention. The wireless communication device<br>
100 comprises a processing unit module 110 and a Radio Frequency (RF) module 135,<br>
similar to a micro processor or a digital processor, a power control module 106, an<br>
antenna 140, a battery 155, a display module 115, a keypad 120, a storage module 130<br>
(e.g., Read Only Memory (ROM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and flash<br>
memory), a speaker 145, and a microphone 150.<br>
The keypad 120 can be used to enter a command by pressing button(s), and the<br>
microphone 145 can be used to activate voice recognition. The processing unit module<br>
110 can receive and process the entered command in order to perform functions<br>
demanded by the user. In order to perform the user demanded functions, necessary data<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	21	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
can be searched and found from the storage module 130. Moreover, the processing unit<br>
module 110 can display the information related to the user command and the data<br>
searched from the storage module 130 for the user's convenience on the display module<br>
115.<br>
The processing unit module 110 can instinct the RF module 135 to transmit<br>
radio or wifeless signal including the voice communication data. The RF module 135<br>
comprises a transmitter and a receiver for communicating the radio signals. Here, the<br>
radio signals are ultimately transmitted and received via the antenna 140. If the RF<br>
module 135 is able to receive the radio signals, the radio signals are converted into<br>
baseband frequency so that the processing unit module 110 can process the radio signals,<br>
The converted, signals- can be transmitted via the speaker MS on can be transmited in a<br>
form that can be decoded. The RF module 135 can receive data from the network or can<br>
be used to transmit information measured or arising at the radio communication device<br>
to the network. The storage module 130 can be used to store the information measured<br>
or taking place at the radio communication system. Furthermore, the processing unit<br>
module 110 can be used to receive the data from the radio communication system, to<br>
process the received data, and to transmit the processed data.<br>
The wireless network and the wireless communication device 100, which<br>
receives point-to-multipoint multimedia or multicast service, can receive a plurality of<br>
service group control information formed by control information of services grouped<br>
into service groups via the RF module 135. Furthermore, the plurality of service group<br>
control information periodically received from the processing unit module 110 can be<br><br>
WO 2006/104343	22	PCT/KR2006/001141<br>
used to acquire control information of service(s) which the radio communication device<br>
100 is receiving. In addition, the control information grouped into service groups can be<br>
repeatedly received via the processing unit module 110 which controls the RF module<br>
135.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the<br>
