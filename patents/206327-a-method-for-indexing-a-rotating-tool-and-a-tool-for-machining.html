A  METHOD  FOR INDEXING A ROTATING TOOL AND, A TOOL  FOR MACHINING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method of indexing a rotating tool<br>
used in machining, in which method: the tool is rotated around its axis in a<br>
5     spindle of a machine tool; and at least one cutting part comprised by the tool is<br>
indexed relative to a body of the tool in such a manner that the cutting part has<br>
at least a first position and a second position.<br>
[0002] The invention further relates to a tool for machining, the tool comprising at, least a body, at least one cutting part, and means for indexing 10     the cutting part relative to the body into at least a first position and a second position.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Different machine tools are used in machining, such as mill-ing machines, horizontal boring and milling machines and drilling machines.<br>
15     Lathes may also comprise rotating tools. Machine tools comprise a spindle, in<br>
  which a tool can be arranged, which can be made to rotate around its axis by<br>
rotating  the spindle. The tool comprises a body having fastening means for<br>
fastening the tool to the spindle. The tool further comprises at least one cutting<br>
part having a cutting edge for detaching material from an object being ma-<br>
20    chined. The cutting part typically comprises an insert, which can be replaced when required. The cutting part may comprise an insert holder for fastening the insert. Conventionally, the cutting part is preset by moving the insert holder relative to the body of the tool into an accurately predetermined position, after which it is locked immobile. The insert holder usually comprises a mechanical<br>
25    locking, usually a screw locking, for holding the cutting part in the set position. Consequently, such a tool has only one fixed measure that can no longer be changed in the machine tool. For example, a special boring tool has to exist for each hole to be bored and having a different diameter. The problem herein is that the number of tools becomes large. However, there is not always suffi-<br>
30    ciently space in the tool magazines of machine tools for all different tools, not to mention reserve tools. This presents a significant drawback particularly in automatic machine tools intended for unmanned drive. Furthermore, much time is taken by change of tools when machining with a tool having a special form, since a special tool, set to one measure, has to be retrieved for each<br>
35     measure machined, which naturally impairs the performance of machining.<br><br><br>
[0004] As a solution to the above problem, a tool for machining has been developed, wherein the cutting part can be moved relative to the body of the tool by means of an electric actuator. However, one of the drawbacks is that the electric conductor has to be led to the rotating tool through the spindle. 5    in addition, the machine tool has to comprise a special separate control appa-ratus for controlling the actuator. Consequently, an electrically controlled tool is subject to significant changes in conventional machine tools. Furthermore, an electrically controlled tool is susceptible to malfunction under demanding ma¬chine shop circumstances. A further drawback of an electrically adjustable tool 10     is its high price.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved method and tool for machining.<br>
[0006] The method of the invention is characterized by locking the 15     indexed cutting part immobile relative to the body of the tool by means of a pressure medium operated actuator comprised by the tool.      <br>
[0007] The tool of the invention is characterized in that the tool<br>
comprises at least one pressure medium operated actuator for locking the cu-<br>
ting part into said indexed positions, and at least one conduit for leading pres-<br>
20     sure medium to said actuator.	<br>
[0008] The essential idea of the invention is that the tool has one or<br>
more cutting parts, at least one of which can be indexed into at least two posi-<br>
tions. The indexed cutting part is locked immobile during machining by using<br>
the pressure, medium operated actuator in the tool. The pressure medium,<br>
25    such as for instance cutting fluid, can be led to the actuator from the spindle of<br>
the machine tool along conduits comprised by the tool.	<br>
[0009] An advantage of the invention is that the cutting part of the<br>
tool can be indexed and locked into predetermined positions with normal func-<br>
tions of the machine tools and without electric or the like external means. Ac-<br>
30    cordingly, the tool according to the invention can be arranged in a conventional<br>
machine tool without any special accessories or essential variations. In addi-<br>
tion, a pressure medium operated actuator endures well blows and vibration.<br>
Furthermore, such an actuator can be used to relatively easily create suffi-<br>
ciently strong fastening forces, rendering the tool solid and dimensionally accu-<br>
35      rate.	<br><br>
[0010] The essential idea of an embodiment of the invention is that the actuator is pressure fluid operated. As pressure fluid, cutting fluid is used, which can be led from conduits in the spindle to the tool and further to the ac-tuator. The components existing in a machine tool and associated with the 5     feed and control of cutting fluid can thus be utilized for locking the cutting part.<br>
[0011] The essential idea of an embodiment of the invention is that the movement of the spindle of the machine tool is utilized in indexing the cut-ting part. The tool may comprise means based on centrifugal force or moment of inertia, which, by the action of the rotating movement of the spindle, gener-10     ate a force that can be used for indexing the cutting part.    <br>
[0012] The essential idea of an embodiment of the invention is that the tool comprises a pressure medium operated device for indexing the cutting part. Said device can be operated with flushing medium.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] Figure 1 shows a boring tool comprising a body 1, a fasten-ing part 2 at one end of the body 1, and a cutting part 3 at the other end of the 5     body 1. There may be one or several cutting parts 3. The fastening part 2 may comprise a taper or other suitable means for fastening the tool to a spindle 4 in a machine tool. Furthermore, the fastening part 2 may be a separate piece de-   tachable from and attachable to the body 1. Figure 2 shows the principle of an alternative fastening part 2. On the other hand, the fastening part 2 may refer<br>
10    to a contact surface in the body 1 of the tool, to which one or more pieces can be fastened for fastening the tool to the spindle 4 of the machine tool. When the spindle 4 is rotated, the tool, arranged in the spindle 4 rotates around its longitudinal axis C. The cutting part 3 may comprise an elongated insert holder 5 and an insert 10 fastened thereto. The insert! 10 is an interchangeable part<br>
15    made from a highly durable material and comprising at least one cutting edge.    Alternatively, the cutting edge may be provided directly in the insert holder 5 or the like. The insert holder 5 is arranged transversely to the body 1 and its fas-tening is arranged such that, when required, the insert holder 5 can move in the radial direction A of the tool. The' insert holder 5 may be arranged to be<br>
20     controlled and supported by guide surfaces or the like. Figure 1 shows the cut-ting part 3 in a first, i.e. inner position,, and Figure 2 shows the cutting part in a second, i.e. outer,position. Accordingly, the cutting part 3 has two positions, between which the cutting part 3 can be shifted when it is arranged in the spin-dle 4 of the machine tool. The mutual position of the cutting part 3 and the<br>
25    body 1 can be affected by means of the rotating movement of the spindle 4, and a spring element 6 and an actuator 7. When the spindle 41 is rotated, the   cutting part 3 is subjected to a centrifugal force tending to move the cutting part 3 in the radial direction A of the tool away from the body 1. In Figure 1, the cut-ting part 3 is drawn by means of one or more draw-springs 6 into the inner po-<br>
30      silion and locked immobile by moans of the actuator 7 in such a monnor that<br>
the cutting part 3 retains its inner position in spite of the machining forces and the rotation of the tool. When the locking is released for the duration of index-ing, the cutting part 3 moves into the outer position shown in Figure 2, by the<br>
action of centrifugal force. The cutting part 3 can be locked to this outer posi-<br>
35       tion by means of the actuator 7. The cutting part 3 can be moved back to the<br><br>
inner position by releasing the locking achieved by the actuator 7 and by stop-ping the spindle 4, whereby the cutting part 3 is not subjected to centrifugal force, and the spring element 6 is able to pull the cutting part 3 to the inner po-sition. The cutting part 3 is then locked by means of the actuator 7, and ma-5    chining can be started. The tool may comprise fixed or adjustable contact sur-   faces, against which the cutting part 3 settles tightly in the first and sepond po-sitions, respectively. The tool according to Figures 1 and 2 can be arranged for two different diameters to be machined, whereby fewer tools than previously can be loaded into the tool magazine of the machine tool. In addition, indexing<br>
10    the cutting part 3 for different diameters is very fast compared with a situation where a conventional tool is replaced for each diameter. When the portion 'of tool replacement times relative to machining is small, good performance is achieved.<br>
[0016] In the solution shown in Figures 1 and 2, cutting part index-<br>
15    ing is arranged to be accomplished by rotating the spindle 4. Accordingly, cut¬ting part 3 indexing can be accomplished by using normal machining move¬ments of the machine tool, and no special devices are required. Furthermore, commands regarding movements required in indexing can be easily added to the programs of numerically controlled machine tools. Consequently, the tool<br>
20   according to the invention is suitable for use in conventional machine tools without any changes.<br>
[0017] The actuator 7 may be a pressure medium operated cylinder, whose piston or cylinder is arranged to press against the shaft of the insert holder 5 and cause the friction required in the locking between the cutting part<br>
25     3 and the actuator 7. Alternatively, a pressure medium operated motor or an-other pressure medium operated device can be used for generating the re-quired fastening force. The actuator 7 can be operated by means of the pres-sure medium used in flushing the tool, the tool and the spindle 4 already com-prising conduits 8 required for leading pressure medium to the actuator 7.<br>
30    Flushing refers to cooling and lubricating the cutting part 3, and to chip re-moval. The medium typically used for flushing is cutting fluid, but it can also be another fluid or gas, e.g. water or pressurized air. In other words, the actuator 7 can be controlled by controlling the normal flushing of the machine tool. The necessary control commands can be easily added to programs run in control<br>
35      units 22 of numerically controlled machine tools In the tool, the flushing con-    duit 8 can be branched such that a special conduit 40 leads to cutting part<br><br>
  flushing and  another conduit to the actuator 7. During machining, cutting fluid<br>
is fed, whereby the cutting part 3 obtains the required flushing and, at the<br>
same time, the actuator 7 locks the cutting part 3 in its position. During index-<br>
ing, however, cuttipg fluid is not fed at all.<br>
5	. [0018] In some cases, the tool can be constructed such that the cut-<br>
ting part 3 can be indexed into more than two different positions. In this case, the tool may comprise means for preventing the movement of the cutting part 3 in one direction, but allowing the stepwise movement of the cutting part 3 in another direction. Such a tool comprising several indexable positions can re-<br>
10     place several conventional tools having a fixed setting.	        <br>
[0019] Figure 3 shows, highly simplified, an arrangement based on<br>
   mechanical shape locking for locking a cutting part 3 into indexed positions.<br>
For the locking, the shaft of an insert holder 5 is provided with slots 11a to 11c.<br>
An actuator 7 may comprise a hydraulic motor 12 arranged to drive a rack bar<br>
15   14 by means of a pinion gear 13, and further a locking piece 15 at the end of the rack bar 14.'In the situation shown in Figure 3, the cutting part 3 is in the innermost position, where it is supported against a supporting surface 16. When the locking piece 15 is released from slot 11a, and the tool is rotated around its axis C by means of a spindle 4, the cutting part 3 is subjected to<br>
20    centrifugal force, which moves the cutting part 3 further at the next slot 11b, after which the cutting part 3 can again be locked by pushing the locking piece 15 into slot 11b. The cutting part 3 shown in Figure 3 can be indexed into a third position, allowing the cutting part 3 to be locked by means of slot 11c.<br>
[0020] Figure 4 shows another alternative locking mechanism for<br>
25    locking a cutting part 3 into indexed positions. For the locking, two pressure spaces 17 and 18, into which pressure medium pressure can be led from con-duits 19 and 20, are provided around the shaft'of an insert holder 5. In addi-tion, the shaft of the insert holder 5 is provided with a shoulder 21 for separat-ing the pressure spaces 17 and 18. The pressure surfaces of the shoulder 21<br>
30    on the side of the pressure spaces 17 and 18 are substantially equally large. When a substantially equal pressure fluid pressure is led to the pressure spaces 17 and 18, the forces acting on the shoulder 21 are equal, allowing the cutting part 3 to be locked hydraulically in the desired positions.<br>
[0021] The construction shown in Figure 4 can also be applied by<br>
35    moving the cutting part 3 by means of pressure medium, not by means of the rotating movement of a spindle 4. In this case, leading pressure from a conduit<br><br>
 19 to the first pressure space 17 and releasing pressure via a pressure conduit<br>
20	from the second pressure space ,18 allows the cutting part 3 to be indexed<br>
into a first position. When the cutting part 3 is in the first position, the shoulder<br>
21	is at least partly against the end of the second pressure space 18. When<br>
5     the culling part 3 is indexed into a second position, pressure medium pressure<br>
is led from Ihe conduit 20 to the second pressure space 18, and, correspond-ingly, pressure liquid is released along the conduit 19 from the first pressure space 17, whereby the shoulder 21 moves towards the end of the first pres-sure space 17. In this solution, both indexing and locking take place by means<br>
10    of a pressure medium operated actuator 7. The actuator 7 can be operated by controlling the feed of cutting fluid. Instead of the construction shown in Figure 4, two or more separate hydraulic cylinders can be used for indexing and/or locking the cutting part 3.<br>
[0022] Figure 5 shows a drilling tool for making holes provided with<br>
15     a countersinking. The tool comprises a body 11 It may also comprise a fasten-ing part 2, from which it can be directly or by means of suitable means fas-tened to a spindle 4 of a machine tool. The front part of the bpdy 1 comprises a       fixed cutting part 23 having an elongated spiral drill or the like. Furthermore, a substantially sleeve-like indexable countersinking cutting part 25 is arranged<br>
20     around the body 1 of the tool. When (desired, the indexable cutting part 25 can be indexed into the rearmost position shown in Figure 5, and into the foremost position shown in Figure 6. Indexing  allows the same tool to be used for slant-ing drilling holes having different depths. The cutting part 25 comprises one or more cutting edges 29. The inner surface of the indexable countersinking cut-<br>
25    ting part 26 may be provided with one or more slanting guide grooves 26 and tho outer surfaco of the body 1 with countorparts 27 that fit in said guide grooves 26. When the spindle 4 starts to be rotated with a sudden movement or when the spindle 4 is abruptly stopped, a movement difference is generated between the body 1 and the indexable cutting part 25 because of the different<br>
30    moments of incrtia of the pieces. Said movement difforence and the slanting guide groove 26 cause the indexable cutting part 25 to move in the axial direc-tion E of the tool, guided by the guide groove 26. Figure 6 shows the foremost position of the indexable cutting part 25. Rotation of the spindle 4 with an abrupt movement in the opposite direction results, by the action of moments of<br>
35 inertia, in the generation of a movement difference that makes the cutting part 25 move back into the innermost position shown in Figure 5. Instead of the<br><br>
guide grooves 26, other structures can naturally also be used, enabling the movement of the indexable cutting part 25, by the action of forces of inertia, in the axial direction of the tool. In accordance with the invention, axial movement of the indexable cutting part 25 is prevented by using a pressure medium op-5 erated actuator 7 arranged in the tool. The locking principle of the actuator 7 can be accordant with some of the above-described principles.<br>
[0023] Figure 7 shows a drilling tool comprising a body 1, a fasten-ing part 2, a fixed cutting part 23, and an indexable cutting part 25. In this case, the cutting part 25 is tubular and arranged around the fixed cutting part<br>
10     23. If the intention is to drill holes having a larger diameter D2 the cutting part 25 is indexed into its front position, whereby the hole to be machined gets a diameter corresponding to the ring cutting part 25. The tool may comprise a mechanism corresponding to the solution of Figure 5 for converting the move-ment difference, resulting from the moments of inertia, into an axial movement<br>
15    of the tool. Soine of the above-described principles can be applied to locking<br>
the cutting part 25.	<br>
 [0024] Figure 8 shows a tool used in milling. Two or more cutting parts 3 are arranged in a front surface 1a of a body 1 of the tool on a prede¬termined circle relative to the longitudinal axis C of the tool. Each cutting part 3<br>
20    comprises an insert holder 5 arranged by means of an axle 30 such that it is able to rotate around an axis G. One end of the axle 30 is provided with a power transmission element 31 for affecting the turning of the axle 30. The power transmission element 31 may comprise a latch mechanism, a ratchet mechanism or the like, whereby the axle 30 is arranged to turn in one direction<br>
25    only. In addition, the power transmission element 31 positions the cutting part 3 in exactly the correct position. Furthermore, in connection with each cutting part 3 is an actuator 7 for locking the cutting part 3 immobile relative to the body 1. The insert holder 5 comprises at least two inserts 10a and 10b or cor-responding cutting edges, which can be turned in different positions by index-<br>
30    ing the cutting part 3. In Figure 8, the outermost inserts 10a are indexed for machining. When the first inserts 10a are worn, the second inserts 10b can be indexed in place thereof. The momeVit of inertia can again be utilized in the indexing, i.e. by rotating the spindle 4 abruptly, a movement difference is gen-erated between the body 1 and the cutting parts 3, and it can be utilized to<br>
35    make the cutting parts 3 turn around the axles 30 from one position into an-other. Alternatively, the cutting parts 3 can be indexed by means of a pressure<br><br><br>
medium operated indexing device. In this case, the tool may comprise a hy-draulic motor arranged to turn the axle 30.<br>
[0025] Figure 9 is a simplified figure of another arrangement based on mechanical shape locking for indexing a cutting part 3 and locking it into the 5 desired positions. For locking and indexing, the shaft of an insert holder 5 is provided with two. or, more slots 11a and 11b. The slots 11a and 11b are formed wedged, i.e. pushing a wedged Ipcking piece 15a, 15b into the wedged slot 11a, 11b by means of an actuator 7a, 7b results in that the locking piece 15a, 15b causes the insert holder 5 to move in direction A. The locking piece<br>
10     15a, 15b thus indexes first the cutting part and then locks it in place. For the indexing, the distance between the slots 11a and 11b in direction A is arranged to deviate from the distance between the locking pieces 15a and fl5b in direc-tion A. In the situation shown in Figure 9, the cutting part 3 is in a first ppsition, the locking piece 15a provided with a wedged end being pushed into slot 11a,<br>
15 whereby it has forced the cutting part 3 in direction A into the position shown in the figure. Indexing into a second position takes place by the first locking piece 15a being pulled from the first slot 11a, after which the second actuator 7b starts to pushithe second locking piece 15b into the second slot 11b. Since the centre axle of the second slot 11b and the centre axle of the second locking<br>
20 piece 15b are at a distance from each other in direction A, pushing the wedged second locking piece 15b into the second slot 11b causes the insert holder 5 to be indexed. The wedged form thus causes what is called self-centring, and at the same time shape locking, too. There may be several indexable positions, and there may be a special slot, locking piece and actuator for each indexable<br>
25 position. The actuator 7a, 7b may comprise a hydraulic motor 12a, 12b ar- ranged by means of a pinion gear 13a, 13b to drive a rack bar 14a, 14b, and further the locking piece 15a, 15b at the end of the rack bar 14.<br>
[0026] Let it be stated that other mechanisms' and components known per se in the art can also be used to achieve the force required in the<br>
30 indexing. Consequently, the elements used for the indexing may comprise e.g. pinion gears, rack bars, eccentric discs, etc.<br>
