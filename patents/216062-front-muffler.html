				<td>FRONT MUFFLER<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to front mufflers and, more particularly, to a front muffler,<br>
which is placed between an exhaust manifold and a catalytic converter of an internal combustion<br>
engine and forms an air gap in an internal pipe and a Y-plate to retain the warmth of exhaust gases<br>
discharged from the exhaust manifold, thus reducing the time required to activate the catalytic<br>
converter, and which has a partition wall in the Y-plate, thus attenuating the operational noise in the<br>
engine and increasing engine output.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A muffler device, which is an exhaust device for internal combustion engines, is typically<br>
installed in the lower part of a vehicle body and changes harmful components, such as HC, CO, NCX,<br>
etc., of high temperature and high pressure exhaust gases, which are discharged from an exhaust<br>
manifold during the operation of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle, to harmless gases, such<br>
as CO2, H2O, etc. through chemical reactions using a catalyst prior to discharging the exhaust gases<br>
to the atmosphere.<br>
Exhaust gases from vehicles, which have been recognized as big sources of air pollution, have<br>
been severely regulated in recent years, so that vehicles must be equipped with exhaust devices, and<br>
the exhaust devices have been actively studied.<br>
A conventional muffler device typically comprises a front muffler, a catalytic converter, a<br>
center muffler and a main muffler. Exhaust gases from an internal combustion engine are discharged<br>
to the front muffler through an exhaust manifold, and, thereafter, sequentially pass through the<br>
catalytic converter, the center muffler and the main muffler prior to being discharged to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The exhaust manifold is an exhaust element placed such that, when mixed gases explode in<br>
the cylinders of an internal combustion engine and are discharged as exhaust gases from the<br>
cylinders, the exhaust gases first meet the exhaust manifold. The exhaust manifold also functions as a<br>
collector to collect exhaust gases from the cylinders in one place.<br>
To collect exhaust gases from the cylinders of an internal combustion engine in one place<br>
using an exhaust manifold, the following design factor must be considered. Described in detail, in a<br>
four-cylinder engine which executes suction, compression, explosion, and exhaust strokes, the four<br>
cylinders sequentially execute explosion strokes in the order of first, third, fourth and second<br>
cylinders, so that the third cylinder discharges exhaust gas after the exhaust stroke of the first<br>
cylinder and the second cylinder discharges exhaust gas after the exhaust stroke of the fourth<br>
cylinder. During the exhaust stroke of each cylinder, the exhaust valve is opened before the piston<br>
has reached bottom dead center.<br>
Thus, the exhaust stroke of the third cylinder starts before the exhaust stroke of the first<br>
cylinder has completely finished, so that, if the exhaust system is designed such that the exhaust<br>
gases from the first and third cylinders are directly combined together, the exhaust gas from the third<br>
cylinder may flow back into the first cylinder during the moment that the exhaust valve is<br>
temporarily open during the suction stroke of the first cylinder. In other words, although such<br>
backflow of the exhaust gases into a cylinder does not occur, if exhaust gases are discharged from<br>
two joined cylinders at the same time, the exhaust pipe becomes relatively narrower, such a<br>
phenomenon being called "exhaust gas interference" in the related art.<br>
Thus, exhaust gases discharged from the cylinders must be sequentially guided to the exhaust<br>
pipe. Furthermore, the exhaust manifold has been designed such that the exhaust gases from the first<br>
and fourth cylinders are collected separately from the exhaust gases from the third and second<br>
cylinders in respective channels and, thereafter, the first collected exhaust gases are secondarily<br>
combined together at the rear part of the front muffler. Such a two-stage exhaust gas combining<br>
manner has been called a "4-2-1 manner" in the related art. In addition, a "4-1 manner" has been<br>
used, in which the exhaust gases from the four cylinders are directly combined together in one stage.<br>
The "4-2-1 manner" has been preferably used for vehicles to be driven at high speeds, while the "4-1<br>
manner" has been preferably used for vehicles to be driven under general conditions.<br>
To discharge exhaust gases to the atmosphere without causing exhaust gas interference,<br>
ideally one exhaust pipe extends from each of the exhaust ports of respective cylinders to the outside<br>
of the engine. However, the provision of the exhaust pipes from respective exhaust ports is<br>
undesirably accompanied by an increase in manufacturing costs, an increase in weight, and a<br>
reduction in practicability, thus being less likely to be adapted to practical use. Although the exhaust<br>
pipes are provided to extend from respective exhaust ports, if there is an interval between the time<br>
when the exhaust gases from the manifolds of different cylinders completely reach a predetermined<br>
position, the exhaust gases flowing from a long manifold undesirably meet the exhaust gases flowing<br>
from a short manifold, thus causing exhaust gas interference.<br>
The most important fact in the design of exhaust systems is that the manifolds must be<br>
configured to have similar lengths capable of reducing exhaust gas interference. An exhaust system,<br>
which causes exhaust gas interference, undesirably consumes engine power in forcibly discharging<br>
exhaust gases to the atmosphere, thus reducing engine output.<br>
Furthermore, the exhaust gases just discharged from a cylinder through an exhaust valve have<br>
a temperature of about 1000°C and are, thereafter, gradually cooled while the gases pass through the<br>
exhaust system. The exhaust gases heat the exhaust ports (the ports around cylinder heads at which<br>
the cylinder heads meet the exhaust manifolds) which have been cooled by coolant and engine oil, so<br>
that the temperature of the exhaust gases is reduced. Furthermore, while exhaust gases are<br>
discharged from a front muffler, the exhaust gases lose heat due to the low temperature front muffler<br>
which is cooled by atmospheric air. Thus, the temperature of the exhaust gases is reduced. When the<br>
temperature of the exhaust gases is reduced, the volume of the gases is reduced. If the exhaust gases<br>
having reduced temperature maintain their original volume, the weight of the exhaust gases must<br>
increase. The exhaust gases having increased weight are difficult to circulate or move.<br>
When the exhaust gases are cooled, the time required to activate a catalyst to clean the<br>
exhaust gases is increased, so that an excessive amount of smoke may be generated at the initial stage<br>
of engine startup.<br>
Furthermore, when exhaust gases from two exhaust channels are combined together, exhaust<br>
gas interference is caused, thus reducing engine output and generating operational noise in the<br>
engine.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems<br>
occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a front muffler, which<br>
forms therein an air gap to retain the warmth of exhaust gases discharged from an exhaust manifold,<br>
thus reducing the time required to activate a catalytic converter, and which is provided therein with a<br>
partition wall to attenuate the operational noise of an engine and to increase engine output.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides a front<br>
muffler to discharge exhaust gases, the front muffler comprising a plurality of internal pipes which<br>
communicate with an exhaust manifold of an internal combustion engine; a communication member,<br>
through which the internal pipes communicate with each other; and an external plate which forms an<br>
air gap around outer surfaces of both the internal pipes and the communication member, wherein the<br>
communication member comprises a Y-plate with a partition wall provided in the Y-plate, the Y-<br>
plate comprises a first Y-plate and a second Y-plate, which are placed in an upper position and a<br>
lower position and assembled with each other, the first and second Y-plates being mounted at front<br>
ends thereof to the internal pipes and being combined together at rear parts thereof; and the partition<br>
wall comprises a first partition wall which extends along an internal surface of the first Y-plate and a<br>
second partition wall which extends along an internal surface of the second Y-plate.<br>
Preferably, the first partition wall and the second partition wall are spaced apart from each<br>
other by a predetermined distance.<br>
Preferably, a partition hole is formed in the rear part of each of the partition walls.<br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that the front muffler forms therein an air gap to<br>
retain the warmth of exhaust gases discharged from an exhaust manifold, thus reducing the time<br>
required to activate a catalytic converter, and is provided therein with partition walls to attenuate the-<br>
operational noise of an engine and to increase engine output.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is advantageous in that upper and lower partition Walls of<br>
the front muffler are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance, thus increasing<br>
engine torque and engine output while a vehicle runs at a low or middle speed.<br>
Furthermore, a partition hole is formed in the rear part of each of the partition walls, thus,<br>
inducing gradual combining of exhaust gases and preventing thermal degradation of the partition<br>
walls caused by rapid combining of the exhaust gases.<br>

FIG. 8 is a graph showing engine torque as a function of engine speed for the present front muffler<br>
and a conventional front muffler.<br>
invention is placed in the front part of a muffler device which is an exhaust device for internal<br>
combustion engines. The front muffler of the present invention is placed between an exhaust<br>
manifold (not shown) to discharge exhaust gases from an engine to the atmosphere and a catalytic<br>
converter (not shown) to clean the exhaust gases, with an air gap provided in the front muffler. The<br>
front muffler comprises an internal pipe 22, a Y-plate 23 functioning as a communication member,<br>
an external plate 20, a bellows 30 and a rear pipe 40.<br>
The internal pipe 22 comprises two pipes which define an exhaust outlet. The front ends of<br>
the two internal pipes 22 communicate with the exhaust manifold through a front flange 10 and<br>
define the exhaust outlet, through which exhaust gases from the engine are discharged to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The Y-plate 23 is configured such that the front part of the plate 23 is divided into two<br>
channels by a partition wall and the two channels are combined together at the rear part of the plate<br>
23. In the two channels defined in the front part of the plate 23, the two internal pipes 22 are fitted<br>
and welded to the plate 23 and are joined together at the rear part of the plate 23. The Y-plate 23<br>
comprises a first Y-plate 23a, which is an upper plate welded to a first partition wall 24a, and<br>
a second Y-plate 23b, which is a lower plate welded to a second partition wall 24b. The first and<br>
second Y-plates 23a and 23b are placed in upper and lower positions and are assembled with each<br>
other through a fitting process, prior to being welded together.<br>
The external plate 20 comprises upper and lower parts, which are welded to the outer surfaces<br>
of both the internal pipe 22 and the Y-plate 23 using a steel wire mat 21 such that an air gap is<br>
formed around the outer surfaces of both the internal pipe 22 and the Y-plate 23. The steel wire mat<br>
21 has a mesh structure, which is a net structure made by densely weaving metal wires together, thus<br>
providing a reliable air gap. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the steel wire mat<br>
21 is provided around each of the front part of the internal pipe 22 and the junction between the<br>
internal pipe 22 and the Y-plate 23. However, it should be understood that many steel wire mats may<br>
be placed in many positions to define the air gap without affecting the functioning of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The bellows 30 comprises a cylindrical bellows pipe, with a steel wire braided to the external<br>
surface of the bellows pipe and a cap mounted to each end of the bellows pipe. The bellows 30 is<br>
mounted to the rear end of the Y-plate 23 through a welding process. The bellows 30 can attenuate<br>
the exhaust vibration and the operational noise generated from the exhaust system of the engine, and<br>
can attenuate vibration caused by an uneven road surface while the vehicle is driven on a road, thus<br>
allowing passengers to feel comfortable and increasing the effective lifespan of the exhaust system.<br>
Thus, the bellows 30 can reduce vibration and impact that may be applied to the muffler device.<br>
The rear pipe 40 is fitted into the rear end of the bellows 30 and is welded thereto, and<br>
discharges exhaust gases rearwards. A support hanger 41 to hang and support the front muffler in a<br>
vehicle body is provided on a sidewall of the rear pipe 40, while a rear flange 50 is welded to the rear<br>
end of the rear pipe 40. Two studs 51 to assemble the rear flange 50 with the catalytic converter (not<br>
shown) are provided in the rear flange 50 at diametrically opposite positions.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the Y-plate 23 comprises a first Y-plate 23a, to the internal<br>
surface of which a first partition wall 24a is welded to define an upper partition wall extending<br>
downwards. The Y-plate 23 further includes a second Y-plate 23b, to the internal surface of which a<br>
second partition wall 24b is welded to define a lower partition wall extending upwards. Thus, the<br>
exhaust gases from the two internal pipes 22 can be slowly combined together by the two partition<br>
walls 24a and 24b without being quickly combined together in the Y-plate 23 or causing exhaust gas<br>
interference, so that a reduction in output power of the engine due to exhaust gas interference can be<br>
prevented.<br>
To cause the exhaust gases to be slowly combined together and thereby prevent the partition<br>
walls 24a and 24b from being thermally damaged due to rapid combining of the exhaust gases, a<br>
plurality of first partition holes 25a and a plurality of second partition holes 25b each having a<br>
predetermined size are preferably formed in the rear parts of respective partition walls 24a and 24b.<br>
Furthermore, to cause the exhaust gases to be slowly combined together along the first and<br>
second partition walls 24a and 24b, the two partition walls 24a and 24b are preferably spaced apart<br>
from each other at a predetermined constant interval. If the interval between the two partition walls<br>
24a and 24b is narrower than 1 mm, the operation effect of increasing the engine torque and the<br>
engine output during low/middle speed driving of the vehicle may be reduced. If the interval<br>
between the two partition walls 24a and 24b is wider than 3 mm, it is almost impossible to<br>
accomplish the operation effect of increasing the engine torque and the engine output during the<br>
low/middle speed driving of the vehicle. Thus, the interval between the two partition walls 24a and<br>
24b is preferably set to 1 ~ 3 mm.<br>
The method of manufacturing the external plate 20 and the Y-plate 23 will be described<br>
herein below with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6 which are sectional views taken along the respective<br>
lines A-A and B-B of FIG. 4.<br>
To produce the Y-plate 23 according to the present embodiment, a longitudinal blade-shaped<br>
partition wall 24a, having a plurality of first partition holes 25a at the rear part thereof, is welded<br>
along the central line of the internal surface of the first Y-plate 23a. In the same manner, a<br>
longitudinal blade-shaped second partition wall 24b, having a plurality of second partition holes 25b<br>
at the rear part thereof, is welded along the central line of the internal surface of the second Y-plate<br>
23b.<br>
Furthermore, the first partition wall 24a is bent in a predetermined direction along an edge<br>
thereof so that the first partition wall 24a is provided with a contact surface which contacts the first<br>
Y-plate 23a when the first partition wall 24a is welded to the first Y-plate 23a. The second partition<br>
wall 24b has a shape equal to the above-mentioned shape of the first partition wall 24a.<br>
The first and second Y-plates 23a and 23b, each having a partition wall, are arranged to<br>
vertically face each other and are welded together to form a single Y-plate 23. Thereafter, two<br>
internal pipes 22 are fitted into the front end of the Y-plate 23 and are integrated with the Y-plate 23<br>
through a welding process. Thus, exhaust gases, flowing from the two internal pipes 22, pass<br>
through the Y-plate 23 and are slowly combined without causing exhaust gas interference.<br>
In the present invention, the welding process is preferably executed through any of a variety<br>
of welding methods, for example, a MIG welding method using welding wires.<br>
To form an air gap around the internal pipes 22 and the Y-plate 23, which were welded<br>
together, the steel wire mat 21 functioning as a reinforcing material is welded to the internal surfaces<br>
of the upper and lower parts of the external plate 20. Thereafter, the upper and lower parts of the<br>
external plate 20 are assembled with each other to surround the internal pipes 22 and the Y-plate 23.<br>
Furthermore, the front end of the external plate 20 is assembled with the front flange 10 through<br>
fitting, while the rear end of the external plate 20 is assembled with the bellows 30 through fitting.<br>
Thereafter, the fitted junctions between the front flange 10, the external plate 20 and the bellows 30<br>
are subjected to a welding process, thus producing important parts of the front muffler. After<br>
producing the important parts of the front muffler, both the rear pipe 40 and the rear flange 50 are<br>
mounted to the important parts so that a front muffler is produced. In the present invention, the steel<br>
wire mat 21 is preferably welded to the external plate 20 through, for example, spot welding.<br>
FIG. 7 is a graph showing exhaust noise as a function of engine speed of a front muffler<br>
having a partition wall according to the present invention and another front muffler having no<br>
partition wall. When comparing the exhaust noise of the front muffler having the partition wall to<br>
the exhaust noise of the other front muffler having no partition wall, it is noted that there is little<br>
difference in exhaust noise between the front muffler having the partition wall and the front muffler<br>
having no partition wall while a vehicle runs at a high speed. However, when the vehicle runs at a<br>
middle/low speed, the front muffler having the partition wall reduces the exhaust noise by about 1 ~<br>
3 dB compared to the front muffler having no partition wall, and reduces air current noise.<br>
FIG. 8 is a graph showing engine torque as a function of engine speed of the front muffler<br>
having a partition wall according to the present invention and another front muffler having no<br>
partition wall. When comparing the engine torque of the front muffler having the partition wall to<br>
the engine torque of the other front muffler having no partition wall, it is noted that there is little<br>
difference in engine torque between the front muffler having the partition wall and the front muffler<br>
having no partition wall while a vehicle runs at a high speed. However, when the vehicle runs at a<br>
middle/low speed, the front muffler having the partition wall increases the engine torque by:about 2 ~<br>
6 % compared to the front muffler having no partition wall, thereby increasing the engine output.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed for<br>
illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and<br>
substitutions are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in<br>
the accompanying claims.<br>
