Disposed between the rear portions of the side covers 21, 21 is a rear cover 65 which is formed with an opening 66 for exposing the lower half portion of the taillight lens 48 of the taillight 30, and the upper portion of the rear cover 65 defines a band-shaped portion 65a for partitioning the taillight lens 48, that is, the taillight 30 into the upper and lower portions by being<br><br>
partly fitted into the recess 48a of the taillight lens 48. In other words, the band-shaped portion 65a for partitioning the taillight 30 into the upper and lower portions in appearance at a position corresponding to the projecting end of the V-shape is provided on the light 2 9 formed in a V-shape projecting rearward in side view.<br>
[0033]<br>
Referring specifically to Fig. 3, the lower portions on both sides of the rear cover 65 is provided with recesses 67, 67 depressed so that the closed ends serve as mounting seats 68 and supporting plates 69... which come into abutment with the mounting seats 68... are fixed to the lower portion mounting arms 37. . . of the housing 32 with bolts 70.... In addition, the weld nuts 71... are secured to the supporting plates 69..., and the rear cover 65 is mounted to the housing 32 of the light 2 9 by screwing and tightening screw members 72 ... inserted from the recesses 67... through the mounting seats 68... and the supporting plates 69...into weld nuts 71....<br>
[0034]<br>
In Fig. 9, a water draining holes 73. . . extending linearly in the vertical direction are provided on the lower portions of the groove 51 of the housing 32 corresponding to the both partitioning walls 32d..., that is, on the bottoms of the portion thereof corresponding to<br><br>
the both ends of the band-shaped portion 65a for discharging water entering into the groove 51 toward the rear surface side of the housing 32 as shown by an arrow.<br>
[0035]<br>
In Fig. 10, water draining holes 74... in communication with the lower portion of the groove 51 provided on the opening edge of the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a are provided on both sides of the lower portion of the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a so as to extend from the groove 51 toward the front. In other words, water flowing in the lower half portion in the groove 51 downward is discharged toward the outside via the water draining holes 74... as indicated by an arrow and, since the outer ends of the water draining holes 74... are opened toward the front, the possibility that water splashed from below enters into the groove 51 through the water draining holes 74... is minimized.<br>
[0036]<br>
Referring specifically to Fig. 8, an opening 75 is provided on the lower portion of the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a, and a lens 76 is attached to the opening 75. Therefore, light from the taillight bulb 4 6 is introduced downward through the lens 7 6, and light is illuminated onto a license plate 77 and a reflecting plate 78 mounted to the rear fender 27.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
The operation of this example will be described below. The light 2 9 including the taillight 30 and the winkers 31, 31 arranged on both sides of the taillight 30 is provided at the rear portion of the vehicle body in a V-shape projecting rearward in side view, and the band-shaped portion 65a for partitioning the taillight 30 into the upper and lower portions in appearance is provided at a position corresponding to the V-shaped projecting end of the V-shape.<br>
[0038]<br>
Therefore, the appearance of the taillight 30 is divided into the upper and lower portions by the band-shaped portion 65a, whereby it seems that two lights exist and hence it has an effect to attract attention. Accordingly, the choices in design of the light 29 can be further increased.<br>
[0039]<br>
In addition, the band-shaped portion 65a is formed on the upper portion of the rear cover 65 which is formed with the opening 66 for exposing the lower half portion of the taillight lens 48 of the taillight 30, the band-shaped portion 65a covers the recess 48a provided on the intermediate bent portion of the taillight lens 48, and the screw members 57... for mounting the taillight lens 48<br><br>
to the housing 32 are arranged in the recess 48a. Therefore, the mounting portion of the taillight lens 48 with respect to the housing 32 is covered by the band-shaped portion 65a, and hence appearance can be improved.<br>
[0040]<br>
Since the light 29 is formed in a V-shape projecting rearward in side view, water enters between the taillight lens 48 and the winker lenses 49... and flows downward. However, the partitioning walls 32d... for partitioning the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a and the pair of left and right winker reflecting mirror sections 32b... are provided in the housing 32, the partitioning walls 32d. . . is formed with the groove 51 for fitting the edge of the taillight lens 48 and the edges of the winker lenses 49..., and the water draining holes 73... are provided at both ends of the band-shaped portion 65a, that is, on the bottom of the groove 51 at positions corresponding to the projected end of the V-shape. Therefore, rain water or the like which tends to enter between the taillight lens 48 and the winker lenses 49... and flow downward can be discharged smoothly without affecting the appearance of the outer light 29.<br>
[0041] In addition, even when the water draining holes 73... are formed so as to extend simply in the vertical<br><br>
direction without providing labyrinth structure by being provided at the projected end of the V-shape, water is prevented from entering into the groove 51 from below and can be discharged to the back surface side of the housing 32, whereby accumulation of water due to the labyrinth structure is prevented to enable the smooth discharge.<br>
[0042]<br>
In this example, the water draining holes 74,., which communicate with the lower portion of the groove 51 provided at the opening edge of the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a are provided so as to extend from the groove 51 toward the front at both sides of the lower portion of the taillight reflecting mirror section 32a in addition to the water draining holes 73.,. at the projecting end of the V-shape. The water draining holes 73..., 74... at two positions; at the projecting end of the V-shape and the lower portion of the V-shape provides a structure which achieves efficient drainage while maintaining water-proof effect.<br>
[0043]<br>
Although the example of the present invention has been descried thus far, the present invention is not limited to the above-described example, and various modifications in design can be performed without departing the present invention stated in claims.<br><br>
