Device for adjusting the ecartement<br>
The invention relates to a device for the adjustment of the "ecartement" (distance) between a nipper aggregate and the following detaching rollers on a combing machine according to the preamble of the patent claim 1 or 2.<br>
Known combing machines (for instance the E62 of the "Maschinenfabrik Rieter AG") comprise a back and forth swinging nipper aggregate which submits the combed fibre tuft to a following pair of detaching rollers for the tearing off, whereby the front end of the fibre tuft is transferred into the clamping line of the detaching rollers. During this tearing off procedure the nipper is in its front position and is opened. During the tearing off procedure the fibre package being pulled out of the submitted cotton is, at least with its back end, pulled through a top comb. Thus contaminations still present in the fibre material (e.g. parts of hull, but also neps) are being held back and separated. The nipper aggregate of the machine described above is mounted on each side on two swivel arms. The front swivel arm is mounted on the circular comb shaft, while the respective rear swivel arm is fixedly attached on an intermittedly driven nipper shaft. The nipper shaft is driven by a swinging hub which is fixedly connected with the shaft through a clamping sleeve. The intermitting movement of the nipper shaft takes place via a connecting rod which is attached on the swinging hub and mounted in a holder which is moved on a control disk.<br>
To change the percentages of the combing noils (portion of the combed short fibres) it is necessary to adjust the distance between the nipper and the clamping line of the following detaching rollers at the front point of reversal (dead centre) of the nipper movement accordingly. This distance generally is called „Ecartement". With larger Ecartement. the portion of the combing noils percentages increases: with smaller Ecartement this is reduced correspondingly.<br>
This can also be followed up in the literature „Die Kurzstapelspinnerei; volume 3: combing, drawing, flyer of "The textile Institute", ISBN 3-908.059-01-1 on the pages 16 to 25, where the further working principle is also explained.<br><br>
20.11.02 FRH/PS-2943A/E<br>
In order to change the front point of reversal of the nipper movement and thus the ecartement, the clamping connection between the nipper shaft and the clamping sleeve is loosened. For the rotation of the nipper shaft in its circumferential direction in relation to the clamping sleeve, the given locking device between the nipper shaft and the clamping sleeve must be released, and/or be reset.<br>
This locking device can consist of a radially outward projecting rod being attached at the front surface of the nipper shaft, in which rod-adjusting screws are provided, being arranged at a distance to each other which, in locked position, is forced against a bracket being attached on the front surface of the clamping sleeve. On the outer circumference of the clamping sleeve of known designs a scale is provided with several gradation lines arranged next to each other, said scale faces a marking notch which is being positioned opposite it, whereat said marking notch is provided on the corresponding outer surface of the rod attached on the nipper shaft.<br>
In order to now rotate the nipper shaft in relation to the clamping sleeve, after loosening of the clamping connection of the clamping sleeve, one of the adjusting screws of the bracket must be released while the other adjusting screw is reset accordingly. This rotation of the nipper shaft in relation to the clamping sleeve must be accomplished so far until the notch on the rod faces the desired opposite gradation line on the scale of the clamping sleeve. With this device it has so far been possible to accomplish a rough setting of the ecartement, whereby, however, for the micro-adjustment, additional auxiliary means, like gauges, sensing elements etc. have been necessary in order realize settings with accurate values. With the described auxiliary means the distance at the nipper aggregate was checked manually. A deviation of 0.1 mm at the ecartement has already consequences on the percentage of the combing noils. Therefore, it is necessary to first make a coarse adjustment with the known devices by means of the scale on the clamping sleeve against the notch on the rod and to accomplish afterwards, with the manual setting of the gauges, a micro-adjustment by readjusting the adjusting screws, until the desired distance measurement has been reached. This procedure is very time-consuming and requires well-trained personnel in order to accomplish accurate settings.<br><br>
20.11.02 FRH/PS-2943A/E<br>
The invention is thus based on the task to suggest a device which allows for the elimination of the known disadvantages and makes possible a simple and accurate setting of the ecartement from one place.<br>
This task is solved in that the marking on the setting element, which faces the scale of the clamping sleeve, is designed as vernier (auxiliary scale). With the suggested vernier (nonius) instead of the simple notch used so far, and/or marking, it is now possible to accomplish accurate settings of the ecartement exactly up to a step of 0.1 mm, in particular if, as is further suggested, the vernier is provided with a 10-pitch gradation.<br>
By way of the a following exemplified embodiments the invention is more closely illustrated and described, wherein show:<br>
Figure 1 a schematic side view of a nipper aggregate with drive shaft<br>
Figure 2        a schematic partial view of the drive shaft within the zone of the gear<br>
Figure 3        a plan view onto the adjustment device<br>
Figure 4        a view X according to figure 3<br>
Figure 1 shows a nipper aggregate 1 with a lower nipper plate 2 and an upper nipper plate 3 swivable mounted on the lower nipper plate 2. In the nipper aggregate 1 a feeding roller 5 is rotatable mounted which performs a discontinuous movement during a combing cycle in order to submit a cotton web W being unreeled from a not shown roll to a circular comb 7 rotatable arranged for combing below the nipper aggregate 1. During this combing process the nipper aggregate 1 (called short nipper 1) is positioned in a rear position not shown, whereby the nipper elements are in closed condition. The end portion 9 (fibre tuft) thereby projecting from the nipper is then combed by the circular comb segment 8. Thereafter the nipper 1 is brought into the front position shown in figure 1 where it is open. In this position a top comb 10 penetrates the cotton end 9 projecting over the nipper 1, During the forward movement of the nipper 1 the<br><br>
20.11.02 FRH/ps-2943A/E<br>
cotton wool end 9 gets into the clamping line K of a following pair of detaching rollers 12 and there it is soldered with a fibre web V.<br>
To accomplish the reciprocating swivel motion of the nipper 1 said nipper is supported at its front zone on both sides on swivel arms 14 which are mounted rotatable on the lower nipper plate 2 and on the stationary circular comb shaft 6. In the rear section of the nipper 1 said nipper is supported on swivel arms 15 arranged parallel to each other, whereat said arms are mounted rotatable on the shaft 17 of the nipper 1. On their opposite end the swivel arms 15 are fixedly connected to a shaft 20 which is stationary mounted. This rotation-locked connection is accomplished by the clamping force of the schematically illustrated screws 19 which clamp the schematically illustrated half shells 21, 22 of the swivel arm 15 against the shaft 20. The drive of the nipper movement is provided by a discontinuous movement of the shaft 20 which is described in more detail in the following.<br>
The nipper 1 in the position shown in figure 1 is in a foremost position (front dead centre point), from which the backward motion of the nipper takes place afterwards. In this front position the nipper lip 4 of the lower nipper plate 2 has a distance E which commonly is called ecartement. In order to determine the amount of the short fibre portion (combing noils) to be combed, this distance E must be adjusted accordingly. This setting takes place by changing the position of the angle of rotation which is generated by the shaft 20 during a combing cycle. That means, depending on the desired increase or decrease of the ecartement E, the angle generated by the rotation of the shaft 20 in circumferential direction of the shaft, must be shifted to one or the other direction. This takes place with a device shown in the following figures 2 to 4.<br>
In figure 2 a control disk 24 is shown which is part of a gear not further shown and which rotates around the shaft 25 in the direction of rotation D. At a distance to the shaft 25, a shaft 26 is attached on the control disk 24 on which a bearing 28 is rotatable mounted. In the bearing 28 a connecting rod 29 with a swinging hub 30 is adjustably mounted. The swinging hub 30 comprises two bearing halves 31, 32, which are screwed against each other with mounting means not further shown. In the hub 30 a<br><br>
20.11.02 FRH/ps-2943A/E<br>
sleeve 34 is mounted which consists of two sleeve halves of 35, 36 which, by means of the screws 38, as is shown in figure 3 and 4, are clamped against the shaft 20 mounted in the sleeve. Thus a frictional engagement is achieved between the sleeve 34 and the shaft 20. Usually more than two screws 38 are used for the generation of the clamping force; for clarity reasons, however, only two were shown.<br>
Between the swinging hub 30 and the sleeve 34 a feather key 39 is arranged by which the rotation-locked connection is positioned between the hub 30 and the sleeve 34. The sleeve 34 is stationary mounted via the bearing 40 in the machine frame MG. As is seen in particular in figure 3, a label 42 is attached on a section of the outer circumference of the sleeve half 35, said label is provided with gradation lines, which are partly provided with numbers that indicate the ecartement to be adjusted. The distance between the gradation lines is constant. In figure 4 a control means 44 is shown which is attached on the shaft 20 by a bolt connection 45. This control means 44 is provided to hold the adjusting screws 45, 46, which are forced against a bracket 48 which is attached on the sleeve parts 35, 36 of the sleeve 34 by the screws 49, 50.<br>
On the outer surface 50 of the control means 44 a label 51 is attached whereon there are gradation lines at an equal distance which face the gradation lines on the label 42. In the present embodiment there are ten gradation lines next to each other marked on the label 51, so that it is possible to accomplish accurate settings between the gradation lines of the label 42 in decimal steps. If an ecartement of for example 7,5 is to be set, then the setting takes place by way of the screws 45, 46, in that the zero line of the label 51 is moved so far between the lines 7 and 8 of the label 42, until the line 5 of the label 51 gets into alignment with an opposite line of the label 42. A pre-condition for this setting is based on the fact that the gradation lines, arranged next to each other on the labels 42 and 51, have in each case an equal distance to each other. The procedure for adjustment of a desired ecartement is described in the following in more detail. For the adjustment of another ecartement, the combing machine is positioned, with the help of an index disk not shown, on a certain index at which the nipper 1 is positioned in its foremost position, which at the same time represents the dead centre point for the reciprocating motion. As soon as the nipper 1 has reached this position, the combing<br><br>
20.11.02 FRH/ps-2943A/E<br>
machine is stopped. Now, by loosening the screws 38, the clamping connection between the sleeve 34 and the shaft 20 is loosened. If the ecartement, as shown in the position in figure 3, is to be increased for example to the value 10.5, then the adjusting screw 46 is loosened and/or turned back. Subsequently, the screw 45 can be turned farther into the control means 44, whereby the control means 44 is rotated in clockwise direction in relation to the stationary sleeve 35. By this rotary motion the shaft 20, which is fixedly connected by the screw 45 with the control means 44, is also rotated in clockwise direction. Thus the distance E between the nipper lip 4 of the nipper plate 2 and the clamping line K of the detaching rollers 12 becomes larger. This setting movement is continued by turning the screw 45 inwardly for so long, until the zero line of the label 51 gets placed between the lines 10 and 11 and the gradation line 5 of the label (vernier) 51 gets in exact alignment with a gradation line of the label 42. As soon as this position is achieved, the screw 46 is turned into the control means 44, until said screw abuts against the bracket 48 with a certain pressure. Both screws 45 and 46 are now again pressed with tension against the bracket 48 and locate thus the adjusted position of the angle of rotation between the sleeve 34 and the shaft 20. Subsequently the two sleeve halves 35, 36 are again clamped against each other by means of the screws 38, whereby the frictional engagement between the sleeve 34 and the shaft 20 is again achieved. The new ecartement is set, and the machine can be started again. By providing the label 51 with a nonius with equally spaced gradation lines it is possible, without any problems, to also make accurate intermediate settings between the gradation lines of the label 42 without the necessity of time-consuming checking with feeler gauges in the zone of the nipper.<br>
It would be possible to attach such adjusting means also within the zone of other coupling components, that is, within their drive section.<br><br><br><br>
