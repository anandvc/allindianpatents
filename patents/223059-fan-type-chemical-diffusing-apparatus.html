The present invention relates to a fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus for volatilizing and diffusing a<br>
chemical in an airflow produced by a motor driven fan or<br>
blower, and a receptacle for the chemical for use with<br>
such a fan type chemical diffusing apparatus, as well as<br>
a clip type fastening device for fastening a fan type<br>
chemical diffusing apparatus to an object such as apparel<br>
of its user.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
and Objects of the Invention<br>
A fan type chemical diffusing apparatus designed<br>
to volatilize and diffuse a chemical in an airflow produced<br>
by a motor driven fan has been known as described in JP<br>
S53-14329 A.<br>
The apparatus described in that patent literature<br>
comprises a cylindrical housing that constitutes an<br>
apparatus main body equipped with a motor and fan, in which<br>
a cartridge is interchangeably loaded. That contains a<br>
battery and a chemical retainer which holds a chemical<br>
therein . The fan is driven by the motor to produce an airflow<br>
with which the chemical in the cartridge is allowed to<br>
volatilize and diffuse into the atmosphere. At the end<br>
point of the chemical at which it has been fully consumed,<br>
the cartridge including the battery is disposed of and<br>
the apparatus is reused on loading with a new cartridge.<br>
In the conventional apparatus mentioned above,<br>
however, in which a cartridge is designed to be ac-<br>
commodated in the cylindrical housing of a given and<br>
limited size, the cartridge must be limited in size by<br>
the size of the cylindrical housing, and so must naturally<br>
be limited the battery in the number of battery cells and<br>
the chemical retainer (chemical accommodating recep-<br>
tacle) in size, too. The known apparatus has therefore<br>
been deficient for services of an extended time period<br>
and unsatisfactory if an increase in efficacy is sought.<br>
Also in the known apparatus, the power supply is<br>
disposed in a place where the airflow produced by the fan<br>
comes into contact with it. This battery arrangement thus<br>
creating a resistance to the blowing airflow has had the<br>
inconvenience that it makes the chemical volatilized, and<br>
diffused inefficiently.<br>
It is accordingly a first object of the present<br>
invention with the above taken into account to provide<br>
a fan type chemical diffusing apparatus that comprises<br>
an apparatus main body, a chemical receptacle and an power<br>
supply housing which are made independent in volume (size)<br>
from one another to permit their respective variations<br>
in volume to be prepared based on its single basic design<br>
and selectively combined one with another, thereby making<br>
it possible to easily produce variations of the fan type<br>
chemical volatilizing and diffusing apparatus of the<br>
common design that vary in the amount of the chemical<br>
contained and the length of the time period with respect<br>
to the airflow amount by the fan for each service cycle<br>
while solving the abovementioned problems met in the prior<br>
art.<br>
Also, the conventional chemical receptacle in-<br>
cludes a receptacle main body having a cylindrical wall<br>
whose one end is closed with an end wall formed with a<br>
large number of vent holes and a cap body having a<br>
cylindrical wall whose one end is closed with an end wall<br>
formed with a large number of vent holes. The receptacle<br>
main and cap bodies are brought together to form the<br>
chemical receptacle by fitting the cylindrical wall of<br>
the cap body over an outer surface of the cylindrical wall<br>
of the receptacle main body and thereby the outer end<br>
surface of the cylindrical wall of the main body is against<br>
the inner surface of the end wall of the cap body.<br>
Such a conventional chemical receptacle has the<br>
problem that when the receptacle main body is loaded from<br>
its open top with a chemical impregnated body such as a<br>
mass of beads impregnated with a chemical so they rise<br>
slightly above its brim and then the cap body is fitted<br>
over the main body, a faction of the chemical impregnated<br>
particles tends to be pinched between the outer end surface<br>
of the cylindrical wall of the main body and the inner<br>
surface of the end wall of the cap body, which prevents<br>
the cap body from tightly fitting with the receptacle main<br>
body.<br>
Also, since the pinched chemical impregnated<br>
particles are not exposed to the airflow passing through<br>
the chemical receptacle, the chemical impregnated into<br>
these particles is hindered from volatilization and thus<br>
becomes useless.<br>
Also, having axially opposite portions not<br>
identical in form, the conventional chemical receptacle<br>
when slide-fitted to the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
portion of the power supply housing can be fitted only<br>
from one side and cannot be fitted from the other side;<br>
hence hard to assemble.<br>
It is therefore a second object of the present<br>
invention with the above taken into account to provide<br>
a chemical receptacle for a fan type chemical volatilizing<br>
and diffusing apparatus in which the chemical impregnated<br>
particles are kept from getting into an interstice between<br>
the receptacle main body and the cap body, and has its<br>
axially opposite portions made identical in the shape which<br>
either can be fitted to the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
portion, thereby facilitating its assembling.<br>
Also, the conventional fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus is commonly provided on its outer wall with a<br><br>
clip type fastener formed of an elastically deformable,<br>
tongue leaf like clip. This clip has its root portion<br>
attached and united to a support mount formed on the outer<br>
wall side of the apparatus main body in an insertion<br>
assembling method or the like. As its shape is viewed from<br>
its side, this clip has an area near its root portion that<br>
is the most spaced from the outer wall of the apparatus<br>
main body, an intermediate portion extending from that<br>
area towards its end portion and the most approaching the<br>
outer wall to provide a pressure foot portion for the clip,<br>
and the end portion where it leaps away from the outer<br>
wall, describing a circular arc. And, fitting the clip<br>
onto such an object as the hem of a pocket of the upper<br>
wear or the waist belt causes the object to be inserted<br>
and caught between the clip's pressure foot portion and<br>
the outer wall of the fan type chemical diffusing apparatus,<br>
and thereby this portable apparatus to be fastened and<br>
suspended.<br>
By the way, with a conventional clip type fastening<br>
device as described above, the inconvenience has so far<br>
been met that the apparatus fastened tends to slip off<br>
the object to fall down while the user is at work. This<br>
has been found to be by reason of the fact that the surface<br>
of the wall to which the clip's pressure foot portion<br>
opposes is flat. Then, the force of the clip which<br>
effectively exerts to grip the object acts only on the<br>
space between the clip's pressure foot portion and the<br>
outer wall and, even if the gap between them is assumed<br>
to be zero, the force is limited only on the area lying<br>
between them. Then, if the object caught between them is<br>
so thin as the hem of a pocket, the force to grip it would<br>
be too weak to firmly fasten the apparatus of some weight<br>
to such an object from which it is suspended.<br>
On the other hand, a thick wear or a waist belt<br>
as the object gripped which gives greater deformation to<br>
the clip provides greater force to grip therefor without<br>
the above inconvenience but, if the object is of a slippy<br>
material, the flatness of the surface of the outer wall<br>
as its counterpart inconveniently tends to cause the object<br>
to slip off the clip and the apparatus here again tends<br>
to slip off the object to fall.<br>
While it is possible to increase the force to grip<br>
by the pressure foot portion by incorporating the clip<br>
into the support mount on the apparatus main body so that<br>
the pressure foot portion is held in elastic contact with<br>
the outer wall surface under a given pressure , this measure<br>
inconveniently not only complicates assembling the clip<br>
with the apparatus main body but also poses a problem of<br>
strength on the clip by the fact that a large force<br>
constantly is left to act on its root portion.<br>
It is therefore a third object of the present<br>
invention to eliminate these inconvenience met in the prior<br>
art, and to provide a clip type fastening device that can<br>
be fastened to an object, regardless of whether it is thin<br>
or thick while holding the object caught thereby.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY of THE INVENTION<br>
In order to achieve the first object mentioned above ,<br>
there is provided in accordance with the present invention<br>
in one aspect thereof a fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus, characterized in that it comprises: an<br>
apparatus main body including a fan for producing an<br>
airflow, a motor for driving the fan and an airflow orifice<br>
through which the airflow produced by the fan passes; a<br>
chemical receptacle for accommodating a chemical im-<br>
pregnated body therein that is impregnated with a chemical,<br>
the chemical receptacle having vent holes; and a power<br>
supply housing for receiving a power supply therein, the<br>
power supply powering the motor, wherein the chemical<br>
receptacle and the power supply housing are adapted to<br>
be detachably loaded in the said apparatus main body and<br>
when loaded are each positioned therein so as to receive<br>
essentially no limitation in volume from the other.<br>
This feature of the invention permits an apparatus<br>
main body, a power supply housing and a chemical receptacle<br>
which are independent of each other in volume (size) to<br>
be adopted. Variations different in volume of the apparatus<br>
main body, the power supply housing and the chemical<br>
receptacles may be prepared and selectively used or<br>
combined to enable variations different in size of the<br>
fan and motor (blower) to be adopted and various settings<br>
such as changes in the amount of a chemical and adjustments<br>
of the time period for services of the apparatus to be<br>
easily accomplished depending on particular places in<br>
which the apparatus is used. The above feature also permits<br>
the chemical receptacle alone to be exchanged when the<br>
chemical therein has been depleted.<br>
According to one specific feature of the present<br>
invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus described above is characterized in that it<br>
further comprises a chemical receptacle retainer for<br>
holding the said chemical receptacle therewith and a<br>
cartridge made of the chemical receptacle retainer and<br>
the power supply housing made integral with each other,<br>
the cartridge being adapted to be disengageably inserted<br>
into and engaged with, and thereby loaded in , the apparatus<br>
main body.<br>
This specific feature of the invention permits a<br>
cartridge made of the chemical receptacle retainer and<br>
the power supply housing made unitary to be detachably<br>
loaded into the apparatus main body. Therefore, when a<br>
battery used for the power supply has been exhausted and/or<br>
when the chemical has been depleted, exchanging the<br>
cartridge as a whole alone for the apparatus main body<br>
renders the apparatus reusable immediately, conven-<br>
iently.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>
present invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus described above is characterized in<br>
that it further comprises a chemical receptacle retainer<br>
for holding the chemical receptacle therewith, the<br>
chemical receptacle retainer and the power supply housing<br>
being adapted to be disengageably inserted into and engaged<br>
with, and thereby loaded, in the apparatus main body<br>
separately from each other.<br>
This specific feature of the invention permits the<br>
chemical receptacle retainer to be detachably loaded into<br>
the apparatus main body and the power supply housing to<br>
be detachably loaded into the apparatus main body as well.<br>
Therefore, when a battery used for the power supply has<br>
been exhausted and/or when the chemical has been depleted,<br>
merely exchanging the chemical receptacle retainer and/or<br>
the power supply housing for the apparatus main body<br>
renders the apparatus reusable immediately, conveniently.<br>
Also, for example, if the power supply is of a commercial<br>
electric power, it becomes possible to exchange the<br>
chemical receptacle alone upon unloading the chemical<br>
receptacle retainer alone from the apparatus main body.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>
present invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus described above is characterized in<br>
that the chemical receptacle is made integral with the<br>
chemical receptacle retainer.<br>
This specific feature of the invention provides<br>
economical advantages for the process of forming or molding<br>
them. Also, the time and labor that need to be expended<br>

receptacle retainer can advantageously be saved.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>
present invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus described above is characterized in<br>
that the said apparatus main body further includes a switch<br>
for turning on and of f current conduction to the said motor,<br>
and a pilot lamp for indicating or ascertaining this<br><br>
current conduction.<br>
This specific feature of the invention of providing<br>

into the apparatus main body is brought into contact with<br>
the power supply received in the power supply housing to<br>
establish electric connection between the power supply<br>
and the switch.<br>
This specific feature of the invention prevents<br>
the mistaken use or misuse because it is ensured that<br>
turning ON the switch on the apparatus main body by itself<br>
does not drive the fan.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>

the cartridge from detaching from the apparatus main body<br>
unless the unloading means is acted on to release its<br>
insertion engagement. It prevents the cartridge in the<br>
apparatus used, for example, as suspended from the shoulder<br>
of the user in a fieldwork from going astray. Also,<br>
providing an unloading or engagement release button on<br>
the side of the apparatus main body allows the unloading<br>
means to be repetitively used if the cartridge is<br>
discarded.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>
present invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus described above is characterized in<br>
that the apparatus further comprises a member attached<br>
to a rear surface of the apparatus main body for having<br>
the apparatus main body suspended from, or fixed fast to,<br>
another body or object.<br>
This specific feature of the invention permits the<br>
apparatus to be used as hung on a strap, suspended from<br>
the shoulder or fastened on the waist belt. It also permits<br>
the apparatus if used as fixed fast to another object or<br>

thereof with a shutter for controlling the rate of flow<br>
of air passing through the chemical receptacle.<br>
This specific feature of the invention of enabling<br>
the rate of airflow through the chemical receptacle to<br>
be controlled permits the rate of diffusion of the chemical<br>
therefrom to be changed.<br>
According to another specific feature of the<br>
present invention in this aspect, the fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus described above is characterized in<br>
that it further comprises a timer incorporated in the said<br>
apparatus main body for establishing a time period of<br>
operation of the said motor.<br>
This specific feature of the present invention of<br>
enabling a timer to be installed and preset eliminates<br>
the need to turn ON and OFF the switch, and permits the<br>
user to preset the time period as it likes, to prevent<br>
the user from forgetting to switch off, resulting in no<br>
waste.<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned second<br>
object, there is also provided in accordance with the<br>
present invention in a second aspect thereof a chemical<br>
receptacle for use with a fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus for diffusing a chemical in a chemical im-<br>
pregnated body accommodated in the chemical receptacle<br>
by means of an airflow produced by a fan, characterized<br>
in that it comprises: a cylindrical receptacle main body<br>
having its cylindrical wall closed with its one end wall<br>
formed with a large number of vent holes ; and a cylindrical<br>
lid body having its cylindrical wall closed with its one<br>
end wall formed with a large number of vent holes,, wherein<br>
the cylindrical wall of the said lid body is adapted to<br>
be fitted into and with an inner surface of the cylindrical<br>
wall of the receptacle main body.<br>
This specific feature of the invention that enables<br>
the cylindrical wall of the lid body when loaded into the<br>
receptacle main body to be fitted into the inside of the<br>
cylindrical wall of the receptacle main body, causes the<br>
chemical impregnated particles which are located in<br>
contact with the inner surface of the cylindrical wall<br>
in the receptacle main body to be forced aside into the<br>
interior of the receptacle main body by the cylindrical<br>
wall of the lid member. As a result, there is produced<br>
no pinch of these particles between an end face of the<br>
receptacle main body and an end wall of the lid body.<br>
According to a specific feature in this second<br>
aspect of the present invention, the chemical receptacle<br>
described above is characterized in that it has its axially<br>
opposite side portions identical in the shape.<br>
This specific feature of the invention that makes<br>
the chemical receptacle have its axially opposite side<br>
portions identical in the shape enables the chemical<br>
receptacle to be loaded into the chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section from either side and facilitates its<br>
assembling. Also, the lid body fitted into the receptacle<br>
main body has no external projection. Providing no hook<br>
for fingers, therefore, the lid body is made hard to be<br>
removed from the receptacle main body by, e.g., an infant,<br>
and makes the chemical receptacle highly safe without the<br>
risk that the chemical impregnated body therein is touched.<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned third object,<br>
there is also provided in accordance with the present<br>
invention in a third aspect thereof a clip type fastening<br>
device for a fan type chemical diffusing apparatus,<br>
including a clip member in the form of a tongue attached<br>
to an outer wall of the fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus wherein the clip having a pressure foot portion<br>
is adapted to be so hung on an object such as an apparel<br>
of the user that the object is inserted and gripped between<br>
the external wall of the fan type chemical diffusing<br>
apparatus and the pressure foot portion, thereby fastening<br>
the fan type chemical diffusing apparatus to the object,<br>
characterized in that the clip member comprises a plurality<br>
of clip pressure foot portions disposed mutually spaced<br>
apart in a direction perpendicular to that in which the<br>
object is inserted as aforesaid; and one or more raised<br>
portions so formed on the said outer wall as to come into<br>
between adjacent such pressure foot portions.<br>
This feature in the third aspect of the invention<br>
enables an object such as the hem of an apparel's pocket<br>
when the clip member is hooked thereon to be gripped in<br>
a wavy form between the clip's pressure foot portions and<br>
the raised portion or portions from the outer wall of this<br>
portable apparatus interposed between these pressure foot<br>
portions. Therefore, the portable apparatus comes to be<br>
firmly fastened to the object even if it is a thin cloth.<br>
If the object is a thick cloth, deformation of the clip<br>
member in proportion to its thickness here makes its<br>
gripping force still larger.<br>
Given the ability in this way to fix the clip member<br>
fast to the object such as a cloth, the fastening device<br>
according to this feature of the invention eliminates the<br>
need to bring any pressure foot preliminarily into pressure<br>
contact against the outer wall of the apparatus main body<br>
and to hold it pressured contacted therewith. Since the<br>
clip can be attached in its natural state, its assembling<br>
is made easier.<br>
If the object to be caught is a solid such as a<br>
belt, then the object can be caught without any trouble<br>
by inserting the same into the clip member beyond its<br>
pressure foot portion full to its root portion. The object<br>
is led to enter up to the space defined with the raised<br>
portion or portions, thereby holding the apparatus<br>
fastened thereto without coming off.<br>
According to a specific feature in the third aspect<br>
of the present invention, the fastening device described<br>
above is characterized in that at least of one of an inner<br>
surface area of the pressure foot portion of the clip member,<br>
a surface area of the outer wall that opposes the inner<br>
surface area of the pressure foot portion and a surface<br>
area of a raised portion is made uneven to provide a slip<br>
resistance for the object.<br>
This specific feature of the invention enables the<br>
object, regardless whether it is thin or thick, to be<br>
fastened to by contacting the portions made uneven to<br>
provide a slip resistance thereto.<br>
According to another specific feature in the third<br>
aspect of the present invention, the fastening device<br>
described above is characterized in that the clip member<br>
has a root and an end portion which lie at a substantially<br>
equal height from the outer wall.<br>
This feature of the invention enables this portable<br>
apparatus placed with the clip member facing down to be<br>
placed horizontally.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
An explanation is first given in respect of a fan<br>
type chemical diffusing apparatus according to the first<br>
form of embodiment of the present invention with reference<br>
to Figs. 1 to 16. The apparatus is shown to comprise an<br>
apparatus main body 1, a cartridge 2 formed of a power<br>
supply housing 2a and a chemical receptacle retainer 2b<br>
which are united together, and a chemical receptacle 3.<br>
The chemical receptacle 3 here is adapted to be fitted<br>
into, held by and disengaged from a chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 of the chemical receptacle retainer<br>
2 b . And, the cartridge 2 is adapted detachably to slide-fit<br>
with the apparatus main body 1. Namely, slidably inserted<br>
into the apparatus main body 1 in a direction perpendicular<br>
to the central axis of the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
section 4, the cartridge 2 is adapted to come into<br>
engagement with the apparatus main body 1. To detach the<br>
cartridge 2 or disengage it from the apparatus main body<br>
1, an engagement releasing button 6 is provided.<br>
The chemical receptacle 3 as shown in Fig. 4<br>
comprises a receptacle main body 3a having a cylindrical<br>
wall 7 formed with an annular, projecting rim or flange<br>
7a for engagement axially in its midway and of which one<br>
side is closedwith an end wall 8 made continuous therewith.<br>
and a lid body 3b with which the other side, open end of<br>
the receptacle main body 3a is closed, wherein each of<br>
the end wall 8 and the lid body 3b has a large number of<br>
vent holes 9 formed therethrough. The total open surface<br>
area occupied by the respective vent holes through the<br>
end wall 8 and the lid body 3b is made at least 60 % of<br>
the total surface area of the end wall 8. Accommodated<br>
within the chemical receptacle 3 is a chemical impregnated<br>
body 10, here in the form of a mass of beads or spherical<br>
particles impregnated with a chemical that as will be<br>
described later in detail is made capable of volatilization<br>
in air. Other than being a mass of beads or spherical<br>
particles, the chemical impregnated body 10 may be a mass<br>
of wire or wires or small pieces, or a honeycomb or sponge<br>
structure. They may be made of pulp, nonwoven fabric or<br>
woven fabric, synthetic resin or an inorganic substance<br>
such as silica gel.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 to 8, the cartridge 2 which<br>
comprises the power supply housing 2a and the chemical<br>
receptacle retainer 2b is L-shaped in a side view. It has<br>
at its base portion a power supply accommodated section<br>
11 formed in hollow with one end open. The power supply<br>
accommodating section 11 has a battery case 13 inserted<br>
therein as slidable in and out like a drawer, the battery<br>
case 13 as shown being capable of accommodating therein<br>
two battery cells 12 as the power supply for the apparatus.<br>
The battery case 13 has in its interior at one axial<br>
end side of the battery cells 12 a connecting terminal<br>
14 formed so as to electrically connect the positive<br>
terminal of one of the two battery cells 12 to the negative<br>
terminal of the other. The battery case 13 also has at<br>
its other end side a pair of cutouts 15 and 15 formed to<br>
expose the respective opposite terminals of these battery<br>
cells 12. On the other hand, the power supply housing 2a<br>
to be loaded with the battery case 13 has a pair of cutout<br>
openings 16 and 16 formed at positions beneath which the<br>
cutouts 15 and 15 are respectively arriving when the<br>
battery case 13 is fully inserted into the housing 2a.<br>
This arrangement enables those exposed terminals of the<br>
two battery cells 12 in the battery case 13 to be brought<br>
into contact with a corresponding pair of conducting<br>
members or electrical contacts 36 located outside of the<br>
power supply housing 2a.<br>
The battery case 13 further has an opening or small<br>
window 18 formed through its outer wall 17 to enable the<br>
presence of the battery cells 12 inside to be checked.<br>
This outer wall 17 is also provided with a hook 20 with<br>
which an engagement protrusion piece 19 comes to<br>
disengageably engage when operated by the abovementioned<br>
release button 6.<br>
The chemical receptacle retainer 2b located above<br>
the power supply housing 2a and remote from the power supply<br>
accommodating section 11 is designed to hold the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 detachably in the chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section 4, which is formed open circular in the<br>
chemical receptacle retainer 2b. The chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 is formed in its inner, annular<br>
surface with a first and a second set of projecting pieces<br>
21a and 21b, outer and inner, which as can be seen from<br>
Figs. 4 and 8 are designed to axially hold the circular,<br>
projecting engagement rim 7a on the chemical receptacle<br>
3 inserted into the chemical receptacle retaining section<br>
4 from its inner side. The inner, projecting pieces 21b<br>
temporarily deform when the projecting engagement rim 7a<br>
is led in and out past them and then return to their original<br>
shape. In this arrangement, therefore, carrying the<br>
projecting engagement rim 7a across the inner projecting<br>
pieces 21b outwards brings the chemical receptacle 3 into<br>
engagement with chemical receptacle retaining section 4<br>
to be held thereby. Conversely, carrying the former 7a<br>
across the latter 21b inwards disengages the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 from its retaining section 4 inwards.<br>
The cartridge 2 as will be seen from Figs. 4 to<br>
8 has its end (top) formed with a pair of engagement<br>
projections 22 and has its base laterally formed with a<br>
pair of rails 23 each along the direction in which the<br>
cartridge 2 is slid into the apparatus main body 1.<br>
Mention is next made of the way in which the<br>
apparatus main body 1 is constructed.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4, 5,9,10 and 11, the apparatus<br>
main body 1 as the counterpart of the cartridge 2 to<br>
establish a slide fit therewith, includes, its outer wall<br>
27, an upper inner wall 25 which opposing the chemical<br>
receptacle retaining section 4 in the cartridge 2, is<br>
formed with an inner airflow opening 24 that opposes the<br>
chemical receptacle 3 held by the chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 , and a lower inner wall 26 that opposes<br>
the base of the power supply housing 2a. Provided in the<br>
space between these inner walls 25 and 26 and the outer<br>
wall 27 is a spiral duct 29 that communicates a region<br>
of the inner airflow opening 24 with an outer airflow<br>
opening 28. And, within this duct 29 is there mounted a<br>
silocco fan 32 having a region of its central axis fronting<br>
the inner airflow opening 24, the silocco fan 32 being<br>
coupled to the output shaft 31 of a motor 30 supported<br>
to lie in a region of the center of the duct d9 as shown<br>
also in Fig. 11. The outer airflow opening 28 is formed<br>
in a side face of the outer wall 27 and is made open so<br>
that it faces in a direction essentially perpendicular<br>
to that in which the inner airflow opening 24 faces , thereby<br>
permitting the airflow produced by the fan 32 to be<br>
discharged sideways of the apparatus main body 1.<br>
The apparatus main body 1 has a pair of engagement<br>
holes 33 formed at its inner top, with which the two<br>
engagement projections 22 formed on the top of the<br>
cartridge 2 are designed to engage, respectively. It also<br>
has a pair of grooves 34 and 34 formed in its inner bottom,<br>
two opposed surfaces, with which the two rails 23 and 23<br><br>
formed on the cartridge 2 are designed to engage,<br>
respectively.<br>
With continued reference with Figs. 4, 5,8 and<br>
11, in the apparatus main body 1 the engagement protrusion<br>
piece 1 9 mentioned above is also internally equipped which<br>
with the cartridge 2 brought into engagement with the<br>
apparatus main body 1 is designed to engage with the hook<br>
20 formed on the battery case 13. This engagement<br>
protrusion piece 19 is so internally equipped as to be<br>
movable sideways by means of a spring 35 made integrally<br>
with its body portion from a plastic, within the apparatus<br>
main body 1. The body portion of the engagement protrusion<br>
piece 19 as shown in Fig. 11 is coupled, at its end 35a<br>
opposed to the spring 35 in the direction of its sideway<br>
movement, to the engagement releasing button 6 that is<br>
slidably mounted on the outer wall 27 of the apparatus<br>
main body 1.<br>
Mounted to one inner, lower side face of the<br>
apparatus main body 1 in those areas corresponding in<br>
position to the cutouts 16 and 16 formed in the power supply<br>
housing 2a is a pair of electric contacts 36 and 36 which<br>
are admitted into the battery case 13 through these cutouts<br>
16 and 16 to contact the terminals of the battery cells<br>
12, respectively. These electric contacts 36 and 36 are<br>
each made of a wire that is elastic, and are electrically<br>
connected to the motor 30 via an ON/OFF switch 37 included<br>
the outer wall 27 of the apparatus main body 1. In its<br>
switching circuit is there a pilot lamp 38 connected that<br>
lights up when the switch 37 is turned ON. This switching<br>
circuit may also have a timer 38a connected in series with<br>
the switch 37. The switch 37 is here designed to be turned<br>
ON and OFF by means of a slide piece 39 exposed from the<br>
outer wall 27.<br>
Referring to Figs .2,3 and 4 , this fan type chemical<br>
diffusing apparatus is provided therefor with a clipping<br>
device or clip fastener 48 on the rear 27a of the outer<br><br>
wall 27 of the apparatus main body 1. The clip fastener<br>
48, i.e. , a device for fastening by a clip the apparatus<br>
to an object such as an apparel of the user comprises a<br>
clip 40 having a hole 41 and deformably fastened to the<br>
rear surface 27a of the outer wall 27 of the apparatus<br>
main body 1, and a raised portion or projection 42 formed<br>
to rise from the rear surface 27a of the outer wall 27<br>
and adapted to enter the hole 41 in the clip 40.<br>
The clip 40 is made in the form of a tongue and<br>
has its root portion joined to a supporting mount 44 joined<br>
to the rear surface 27a of the outer wall 21 of. the apparatus<br>
main body, both unitarily by an integrated assembling<br>
method. And, as the clip 40 is viewed laterally, it is<br>
configured to be spaced from the rear wall surface 27a<br>
in a region near the root portion. Then, the clip 40 in<br>
an area closer to its end a little towards the root portion<br>
becomes closest to the rear wall surface 27a to provide<br>
a pressure foot 40a therefor and in an area from the pressure<br>
foot portion 40a to the end leaps away from the rear wall<br>
surface 27a, describing a circular arc.<br>
Because of the hole 41 formed in the clip 40, two<br>
or a pair of such pressure foots 40a are created at the<br>
opposite sides of the hole 41, respectively, namely placed<br>
in a line perpendicular to the direction in which the clip<br>
40 is inserted with. And, it is between these pressure<br>
foots 40a that the projection 42 that enters this hole<br>
41 is formed on the rear surface 27a of the outer wall<br>
27. This projection 42 as viewed laterally is formed to<br>
intersect the pressure foots 40a, and a space 45 is made<br>
up in a region between the root portion of the clip 40<br>
and the rear wall surface 27a.<br>
The supporting mount 44 to which the root portion<br>
of the clip 40 is fastened in flush therewith and the end<br>
of the clip 40 are arranged to lie at the same height H<br>
from the rear surface 27a of the outer wall 27.<br>
The supporting mount 44 is provided at its center<br><br>
with a strap threading hole 43 through which a strap is<br>
threaded.<br>
With the clip device 48 so constructed as mentioned<br>
above, hooking the clip 40 on the hem of a pocket on the<br>
upper wear allows this hem 49 of pocket as shown in Fig.<br>
12 to be inserted into the space between the clip 40 and<br>
the rear surface 27a of the outer wall 27 . Then, the pocket<br>
hem 49 is pressed down or against the rear wall surface<br>
27a with the pressure foots 40a and 40a located at the<br>
opposite sides of the hole 41 in the clip and pressed up<br>
in the hole 41, off the pressure foots 40a and 40a, with<br>
the projection 42, thereby held down and gripped in a wavy<br>
pattern.<br>
As a result, even if an object to be gripped on<br>
and fastened to is a thin one such as the pocket hem 49,<br>
the fan type chemical volatilizing and diffusing apparatus<br>
is firmly caught on and fastened to it. On the other hand,<br>
a thick object being the case will cause the clip 40 to<br>
deform in proportion to its thickness and the space between<br>
the clip 40 and the rear surface 27a to be forced to widen.<br>
This makes even greater the spring pressure applied on<br>
it than on the thin object, thereby fastening the apparatus<br>
even more firmly thereto.<br>
Further, with the object to be caught by the clip<br>
being a waist belt, the belt will be caught in the space<br>
45 between a region of the root portion of the clip 40<br>
and the rear surface 27a of the outer wall 27, thereby<br>
holding the apparatus fastened thereto without falling<br>
off.<br>
The feature that the supporting mount 44 and the<br>
clip 40 are made even in height from the support surface<br>
27a enables an object to be smoothly inserted between the<br>
clip 40 and the support surface 27a. The feature also<br>
enables the fan type chemical volatilizing and diffusing<br>
apparatus to be horizontally placed such as on a table<br>
by simply placing the apparatus with the clip 40 facing<br><br>
down.<br>
In the form of embodiment described above, it is<br>
also possible to configure the clip 40 with a number of<br>
pressure foot portions 40a spaced apart from one another<br>
in the form of the teeth of a comb and a number of projections<br>
42 each designed to enter between adjacent such pressure<br>
foot portions 40a as mounted on the rear support surface<br>
27a of the outer wall 27 of the apparatus main body.<br>
In the form of embodiment described above, at least<br>
of one of an inner surface area of the pressure foot portion<br>
40a of the clip 40, a surface area of the outer wall 27<br>
that opposes the inner surface area of the pressure foot<br>
portion 40a and a surface area of the raised portion 42<br>
is made uneven to provide a slip resistance for the object.<br>
The uneven portion may be made of a plurality of raised<br>
streaks, a large number of punctate projections or an<br>
uneven surface having a slip resistance.<br>
An explanation in detail is next given in respect<br>
of the chemical receptacle 3 with reference to Figs. 13<br>
to 16 .<br>
The chemical receptacle 3 as shown in Figs. 15A<br>
and 15B includes a receptacle main body 3a formed of a<br>
cylindrical wall 7 having its one end closed with an end<br>
wall 8 formed with a large number of vent holes 9. The<br>
chemical receptacle 3 as shown in Figs. 16A and 16B also<br>
includes a lid body 3b formed of a cylindrical wall 7'<br>
having its one end closed with an end wall 8' formed with<br>
such vent holes 9.<br>
Here, the cylindrical wall 7' of the lid body 3b<br>
has an outer diameter such that the cylindrical wall 7' is<br>
closely fitted in the cylindrical wall 7 of the receptacle<br>
main body 3a as received by its inner surface. Further,<br>
the end wall 8' of the lid body 3b is larger in diameter<br>
than the cylindrical wall 7' so that its periphery provides<br>
a flange 7a' for the cylindrical wall 7' . The flange 7a'<br>
is made substantially equal in outer diameter to the<br><br>
cylindrical wall 7 of the receptacle main body 3a.<br>
Further, one of the inner surface of the cylindrical<br>
wall 7 of the receptacle main body 3a and the outer surface<br>
of the cylindrical wall 7' of the lid body 3b where they<br>
are fitted with each other as shown in Figs. 13 and 14,<br>
is formed with an annular recess 82 and the other is formed<br>
with an annular projection 83. Furthermore, the receptacle<br>
main body 3a is formed on its periphery with an annular<br>
projection 7a to enable its detachable engagement with<br>
the receptacle retainer 4 in the fan type chemical<br>
volatilizing and diffusing apparatus.<br>
The cylindrical wall 7' of the lid body 3b as shown<br>
enlarged in Fig. 14 has its inner surface cylindrical<br>
surface that is tapered in an end portion 7b' thereof to<br>
become wider outwards . On the other hand, the inner surface<br>
of the cylindrical wall 7 of the receptacle main body 3a,<br>
too, is likewise tapered in an end portion 7b thereof to<br>
widen outwards.<br>
With the chemical receptacle 3 so constructed as<br>
mentioned above, fitting the cylindrical wall 7' of the<br>
lid body 3b into the inner surface of the cylindrical wall<br>
7 of the receptacle main body 3a unites the two bodies<br>
3a and 3b together as shown in Fig. 13. Then, the flange<br>
7a' of the lid body 3b comes into contact with the end<br>
face of the cylindrical wall 7 of the receptacle main body<br>
3a. Also, with the annular recess and projection 82 and<br>
83 of the cylindrical walls 7 and 7 ' brought into engagement<br>
with each other, the two bodies 3a and 3b are even more<br>
firmly joined together.<br>
This arrangement when the receptacle main body 3a<br>
filled with a mass of chemical impregnated discrete bodies<br>
or particles 10 is closed with the lid body 3b prevents<br>
the chemical impregnated discrete bodies or particles from<br>
getting into the end face of the receptacle main body 3a<br>
and the end wall of the lid body 3b because it permits<br>
the lid body 3b to come to be fitted into the receptacle<br><br>
main body 3a while driving a fraction of chemical<br>
impregnated bodies or particles in contact with the<br>
cylindrical wall 7 of the receptacle main body 3a to move<br>
towards the inside of the receptacle main body 3a.<br>
Then, the outwards widening taper surface 7b'<br>
provided at the end portion of the cylindrical wall 7'<br>
in its inner surface of the lid body 3b causes the lid<br>
body 3b to be fitted into the receptacle main body 3a while<br>
thrusting aside the chemical impregnated bodies 10 inwards<br>
of the receptacle main body 3a.<br>
The chemical receptacle having the chemical<br>
receptacle main body 3a and the lid body 3b fitted with<br>
each other is here made symmetrical in shape about the<br>
annular projecting engagement rim 7a. This permits the<br>
chemical receptacle 3 when inserted into the receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 in the fan type chemical volcitilizing<br>
and diffusing apparatus to be inserted by making either<br>
the end wall 8 or 8' face it.<br>
The chemical receptacle 3 is composed of a material<br>
that is impermeable with a chemical. For example , aluminum,<br>
stainless steel and glass are effective. In an economical<br>
consideration, an inexpensive plastic is effective. In<br>
this case, a polyester plastic is used that is chemical<br>
impermeable, inexpensive and good in both safety and<br>
stability. By the way, a technology expected to be<br>
significant in future is currently under development,<br>
which overcoats an inexpensive resin with a permeation<br>
preventing agent without contact.<br>
The chemical receptacle composed of a plastic may be<br>
impregnated and/or coated with a UV absorber on its inner<br>
and/or outer surface so as to be prevented from degrading<br>
by light. The construction material such as plastics may<br>
be impregnated with antioxidant to have an enhanced<br>
resistance property.<br>
Mention is next made of assembling the apparatus<br>
in this form of embodiment as well as its operation.<br><br>
To build up the apparatus so constructed as<br>
mentioned above, the battery case 13 loaded with the<br>
battery cells 12 is inserted and loaded into the power<br>
supply accommodating section 11 in the cartridge 2, and<br>
the chemical receptacle retaining section 4 in the<br>
cartridge 2 so loaded is loaded with the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 to hold it. The cartridge 2 so loaded is slid<br>
along the inner wall 25 into the apparatus main body 1<br>
and thereby incorporated therein. Then, the engagement<br>
projections 22 and 22 on the cartridge 2 are engaged with<br>
the engagement holes 33 of the apparatus main body 1, the<br>
rails 23 and 23 with the grooves 34 and 34, and further<br>
the hook 20 on the outer wall 17 of the battery case 13<br>
with the engagement protrusion piece 19; hence the<br>
cartridge 2 fitted into engagement with the apparatus main<br>
body 1. The engagement protrusion piece 19 is then moved<br>
along a cam profile 20a of the hook 20 to engage with a<br>
jaw portion of the hook 20.<br>
In this state, the inner airflow opening 24 formed<br>
in the upper inner wall 25 of the apparatus main body 1<br>
is opposed to the chemical receptacle 3 in the cartridge<br>
2. Also, the electrical contacts 36 and 36 mounted to one<br>
inner, lower side face of the apparatus main body 1 enters<br>
the cutouts 16 and 16 from which they come into contact<br>
with the terminals of the battery cells 12 and 12 in the<br>
battery case 13, thereby making up the electric circuit<br>
for the motor 30 . Then , the switch 37 is turned ON by sliding<br>
the slide piece 39 to drive the motor 30 and in turn the<br>
fan 32. Outside air is thus drawn past the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 to flow in through the inner airflow opening<br>
24, which past the duct 29 is discharged through the outer<br>
airflow opening 28. This causes the chemical ingredient<br>
impregnated in the chemical impregnated body 10 within<br>
the chemical receptacle 3 to volatilize in the airflow<br>
passing therethrough and then to diffuse through the outer<br>
airflow opening 28 into the atmosphere. The airflow that<br><br>
the fan 32 produces in the apparatus in this way does flow<br>
remote from the battery 12.<br>
Turning the switch 37 ON for the driving of the<br>
fan 32 also electrically energizes the pilot lamp 38 to<br>
light it, indicating that the apparatus is in operation.<br>
Further, the timer 38a if included in the switch circuit<br>
enables the state of the apparatus turned ON to be switched<br>
OFF after a given time period.<br>
The cartridge 2 is detached from the apparatus main<br>
body 1 by pressing the loading release button 6 inwards<br>
to disengage the engagement protrusion piece 19 from the<br>
hook 20.<br>
The outer airflow opening 28 is formed with a<br>
plurality of crosspieces 28a to allow air to flow out past<br>
interstices between formed thereby. These crosspieces 28a<br>
are provided to prevent entry of a finger or a foreign<br>
matter into the apparatus main body 1, and to play a role<br>
to avert a danger and to prevent the fan from halting.<br>
For the pilot lamp 38 that is lit by its electrical<br>
energization with the switch 37 turned ON, use is<br>
advantageously made of a light emitting diode (LED) to<br>
save consumption of the battery energy. An LED consumes<br>
only 15 % or less of the total current consumption of the<br>
apparatus. The pilot lump 38 then gradually falls off in<br>
intensity as the battery falls in voltage, and goes out<br>
when it becomes dead.<br>
Also in the form of construction described, the<br>
chemical receptacle 3 used can be altered in volume or<br>
size as desired simply by changing the size of projection<br>
of its retainer 2b from the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
section 4 .<br>
On the other hand, the battery cells 12 used can<br>
be altered in number and size, D(R20), C(R14), AA(R6),<br>
as desired by changing the size of the power supply<br>
accommodating section 11 of the power supply housing 2a<br>
and the size of the battery case 13.<br><br>
Fig. 17 shows an example as the second form of the<br>
apparatus according to the present invention in which the<br>
power supply accommodating section 11 and the battery case<br>
13 in the power supply housing 2a are made larger in size<br>
to have four battery cells 12 accommodated therein. In<br>
this instance, leaving the hook 20 unaltered in position<br>
on the outer wall 17 of the battery case 13 allows the<br>
apparatus main body 1 to be used in common as it is without<br>
changing its size. Further, changing the apparatus main<br>
body in volume with respect to the cartridge 2 can change<br>
the fan and the motor in volume as desired.<br>
In these forms of embodiment of the invention,<br>
variations in size of the chemical receptacle 3 may be<br>
prepared that vary in chemical consumed (lasting) time<br>
period for selection and interchange. Further, variations<br>
in battery capacity of the power supply housing 2a may<br>
be prepared that vary in battery exhausted (used up) time<br>
period for selection and interchange. Furthermore, the<br>
ability in the forms of embodiment described to change<br>
the apparatus main body 1 in volume makes it possible to<br>
change the fan and motor (blower) in size to be included<br>
therein, thereby permitting a desired wind velocity and<br>
airflow capacity to be selected in compliance with a place<br>
where the apparatus is used. And, the apparatus according<br>
to the present invention has enabled the time period for<br>
the chemical to be used up and the time period for the<br>
battery to be used up to coincide with each other.<br>
This makes it possible for the apparatus when the chemical<br>
therein has lost its efficacy to become ready for reuse<br>
just upon exchanging the cartridge 2.<br>
While in describing the foregoing forms of em-<br>
bodiment, mention is made of using a battery for the power<br>
supply, the power supply may be a commercial power supply.<br>
Then, the power supply accommodating section 11 in the<br>
power supply housing 2a is provided with a plug to be<br>
inserted to a domestic plug socket and has a power converter<br><br>
incorporated therein that converts commercial electric<br>
power to power in the form adapted for the motor 30 to<br>
drive the fan 32 . It is also possible to make the apparatus<br>
usable with either the commercial power supply or the<br>
battery on selection. For example, in the use of the<br>
commercial power supply, the circuit for the battery is<br>
made blocked from the circuit for the apparatus main body.<br>
Alternatively, the power supply may be a re-<br>
chargeable battery that is charged as it may or does demand.<br>
As will be apparent from foregoing description,<br>
it has become possible to relatively position the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 and the power supply so each of them receives<br>
substantially no limitation in capacity or volume from<br>
the other. It has also become possible to position the<br>
chemical receptacle 3 relative to the chemical receptacle<br>
retainer 2a so it receives substantially no limitation<br>
in volume (no limitation in its axial size) from the latter.<br>
On the other hand, the apparatus main body 1 receives<br>
substantially no limitation in volume relative to the<br>
cartridge 2, either.<br>
While in the forms of embodiment so far described,<br>
the chemical receptacle 3 is shown inserted from the inside<br>
of the chemical receptacle retaining section 4 of the<br>
chemical receptacle retainer 2b and brought into en-<br>
gagement and retained therewith upon the annular<br>
projecting engagement rim 7a getting over across the one<br>
set of projecting piece 21b as shown in Figs. 4 and 17<br>
etc., it may be made possible to insert the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 into the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
section 4 of the chemical receptacle retainer 2a from the<br>
outside thereof.<br>
Fig. 18 shows such an example as the third form<br>
of embodiment of the invention in which the receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 of the receptacle retainer 2a has its<br>
outer open end sufficient in size to accept the annular<br>
projecting engagement rim 7a formed on the chemical<br><br>
receptacle 3. A first and a second set of more than one,<br>
e.g. , three projecting pieces 21a and 21b are here again<br>
formed both rising from the inner surface of the receptacle<br>
retaining section 4 and designed to axially catch and hold<br>
the annular projecting engagement rim 7a between them.<br>
Here, the set of projecting pieces 21b are arranged to<br>
lie at the outer open end of the receptacle retaining<br>
section 4 and outer of the projecting pieces 21a,<br>
permitting the chemical receptacle 3 to be inserted from<br>
the outside of the chemical retainer 2b and caught held<br>
by the receptacle retaining section 4 upon the annular<br>
projection 7a getting over across the projecting pieces<br>
21b. It is also made possible to insert the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 into the. chemical receptacle retaining<br>
section 4 of the chemical retainer 2b from the outside<br>
thereof by providing an arrangement in which the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 is threaded into the chemical receptacle<br>
retaining section 4.<br>
Adopting this form of embodiment make it possible<br>
to exchange the chemical receptacle 3 without disengaging<br>
the cartridge 2 from the apparatus main body 1 and thus<br>
facilitates exchanging the chemical receptacle 3.<br>
Figs. 19 and 20 show the fourth form of embodiment<br>
of the present invention in which the outside of the outer<br>
airflow opening 28 and the outside of the chemical<br>
receptacle retaining section 4 in the apparatus main body<br>
1 are covered with a first and a second hood 51 and 52,<br>
respectively.<br>
The first hood 51 is configured so as to cover the<br>
upper side of the outer airflow opening 28 therewith and<br>
designed to lie detachably held by engagement portions<br>
53 mounted on an area in the periphery of the outer airflow<br>
opening 28.<br>
On the other hand, the second hood 52 is made in<br>
the form of a cylinder with its upper side made longer<br>
like a pent roof and is designed to stay disengageably<br><br>
fitted over the outward projection of the chemical<br>
receptacle retaining section 4 of the chemical receptacle<br>
retainer 2a.<br>
This form of embodiment of the apparatus prevents<br>
in a rainfall drops of rain from getting into the outer<br>
airflow opening 28 and wetting the chemical in the chemical<br>
receptacle 3.<br>
While in the forms of embodiment so far described,<br>
a chemical receptacle 3 is shown which is filled with a<br>
chemical impregnated body 10 that is impregnated with a<br>
chemical therein, it is possible to use, as shown in Figs .<br>
21 and 22, a chemical receptacle 54 that is divided by<br>
a partition plate 55 into two compartments one of which<br>
is filled with a liquid chemical 56 and the other of which<br>
is loaded with an impregnatable body 57. The body 57 is<br>
here impregnated with the liquid chemical 56 by means of<br>
a siphoning cord 58 passing through the partition 55. In<br>
this case, the liquid chemical impregnated in the body<br>
57 is allowed to volatilize in an airflow passing though<br>
the chemical receptacle 54 and thereby emitted into the<br>
outside.<br>
In this form of embodiment, the chemical receptacle<br>
54 having its own upper and lower sides as mentioned above<br>
needs to be fitted with the chemical receptacle retaining<br>
section 4 of the cartridge 2 so that the compartment in<br>
which the liquid chemical 56 is stored lies in the underside<br>
while the apparatus is in service.<br>
Fig. 23 shows the sixth form of embodiment of the<br>
present invention that reverses the direction of the air-<br>
flow with respect to the chemical receptacle 3 and permits<br>
the airflow to be heated while passing through the chemical<br>
receptacle 3.<br>
Specifically in this form of embodiment, an axial<br>
fan 59 is coupled to the drive shaft 31 of the motor 30<br>
so that the fan 59 faces the inner airflow opening 24 and,<br>
when the motor 30 is driven, produces an airflow directed<br><br>
to pass through the inner airflow opening 24 towards its<br>
outside. Further, a heater 60 in the form of a disk is<br>
mounted between the fan 59 and an end face of the inner<br>
airflow opening 24 as held in an annular recess 61 formed<br>
in the upper inner wall 25. The heater 60 is electrically<br>
connected in an electric circuit (not shown) to the power<br>
supply, parallel to the motor 30 driving the fan 59. An<br>
ON/OFF switch included in the electric circuit permits<br>
the heater 60 to be energized to heat up when needed.<br>
In this form of embodiment, a chemical volatilizing<br>
and diffusing air is emanated outwards of the chemical<br>
receptacle 3. Heating up the heater 60 makes it possible<br>
to raise the temperature of the airflow passing through<br>
the chemical receptacle 3 to accelerate chemical<br>
volatilization from the chemical integrated body 10 held<br>
in the chemical receptacle 3. And, in this case, air is<br>
taken in through the outer airflow opening 28.<br>
Forms of embodiment shown in Figs. 24 and 25<br>
represent examples in which the chemical receptacle 3<br>
attached to the apparatus for service is made variable<br>
in chemical capacity.<br>
That is , Fig. 24 show the seventh form of embodiment<br>
of the present invention in which in the cartridge 2 holding<br>
the chemical receptacle 3 in the chemical receptacle<br>
retainer 2b, one end of a coupling cylinder 62 is fitted<br>
over a portion of the chemical receptacle 3 that is exposed<br>
from the chemical receptacle retainer 2b and another<br>
chemical receptacle 3 is fitted into the other end of the<br>
coupling cylinder 62.<br>
This form of embodiment enables two chemical<br>
receptacles 3 to be coupled together coaxially by means<br>
of the coupling cylinder 62, and makes the chemical<br>
capacity in service twice as large as in the previous forms<br>
of embodiment.<br>
Also in this form of embodiment, the use of a<br>
plurality of coupling cylinders 62 permits a plurality<br>
of chemical receptacles 3 to be coupled one to another<br>
in succession and allows the chemical capacity in service<br>
to be selected at any desired multiple of that for a single<br>
chemical receptacle. Further, the coupling cylinder 62<br>
may be configured to extend its cylindrical wall from the<br>
annular projecting engagement rim 7a on the chemical<br>
receptacle 3 so that it may be united with this additional<br>
receptacle 3. Still further, the fit may be not only a<br>
slide fit but also a thread fit.<br>
Fig. 25 shows an example as the eighth form of<br>
embodiment of the present invention in which a single<br>
chemical receptacle 63 can have its chemical capacity<br>
varied according to the position at which its lid body<br>
63b is fitted into its main body 63a.<br>
The receptacle main body 63a here is formed in its<br>
inner surface with three annular grooves 64a, 64b and 64c<br>
axially spaced apart by a suitable distance. On the other<br>
hand, the lid body 63b has an elongated cylindrical<br>
sidewall (engagement portion) 63c that can be fitted into<br>
the receptacle main body 63a and on which an annular<br>
projection 65 is formed for engagement with any one of<br>
these annular grooves 64a, 64b and 64c. And, selecting<br>
which of these annular recesses 64a, 64b and 64c in the<br>
receptacle main body 63a the annular projection 65 on the<br>
cylindrical sidewall 63c is engaged with variably<br>
establishes the depth of fit by which the cylindrical<br>
sidewall 63c can be fitted with the receptacle main body<br>
63a and hence the capacity of the chemical receptacle 63.<br>
The annular projecting engagement rim 7a on the<br>
receptacle main body 63a in the chemical receptacle 63<br>
according to this form of embodiment is positioned spaced<br>
apart from the bottom surface by the same distance a as<br>
in the chemical receptacle 3 shown in Fig. 4. This makes<br>
it possible for this chemical receptacle 63 to be<br>
detachably engaged with the chemical receptacle retainer<br>
2b of the cartridge 2 and held thereby in the same manner<br>
as the chemical receptacle 3 shown in and described in<br>
connection with Fig. 4.<br>
In this form of embodiment, the capacity or volume<br>
of the chemical receptacle 63 is varied stepwise by an<br>
amount corresponding to the distance or spacing between<br>
adjacent annular recesses 64a to 64c.<br>
Instead of the slid fit described, adopting a<br>
threaded coupling by threading the cylindrical sidewall<br>
of the lid body into the receptacle main body to form the<br>
chemical receptacle makes it possible to steplessly change<br>
the depth or extent to which the lid body is inserted and<br>
in turn the volume of the receptacle, by changing the depth<br>
of threading.<br>
Fig. 26 shows the ninth form of embodiment of the<br>
present invention as an example that employs a bellows<br>
for the sidewall of a chemical receptacle 66 in its<br>
receptacle main body 66a. The receptacle main body 66a<br>
of the chemical receptacle 66 is made of an inner portion<br>
66c located inside of the chemical receptacle retainer<br>
2b and an outer portion 66b exposed from the latter, and<br>
which portion 66b is here constituted with the bellows.<br>
The outer portion 66b has its one end face formed with<br>
a large number of vent holes 9 and has at its other end<br>
a flange 67 that comes into engagement with an end of the<br>
inner portion 66c.<br>
In this form of embodiment, changing the degree<br>
of expansion and contraction of the bellows forming the<br>
outer portion 66b enables the chemical capacity in the<br>
chemical receptacle 66 to be varied.<br>
Figs. 27 to 29 shows the tenth form of embodiment<br>
of the present invention as an example in which changing<br>
the airflow rate passing through a chemical receptacle<br>
68 varies the rate of volatilization of the chemical<br>
therefrom.<br>
The chemical receptacle 68 has a pair of end faces<br>
each of which is formed with vent holes 9. One of these<br>
end faces is provided with a plurality of radially-<br>
extending vent regions 68a equiangularly spaced apart from<br>
one another about its center and in which such vent holes<br>
9 are formed as shown. And, the one end face in its outside<br>
has a shutter 69 mounted turnably supported on a pin 70,<br>
and the shutter 69 is formed with a plurality of radially<br>
extending open windows 71 equiangularly spaced apart from<br>
one another. This shutter 69 when turned is designed to<br>
uncover with these open windows 71, and to cover with its<br>
unopen areas, the vent holes 9 in the vent regions 68.<br>
Thus in this form, of embodiment, changing the areas<br>
that the open windows 71 overlap with the vent regions<br>
68a for the chemical receptacle 68 enables the rate of<br>
the airflow through the chemical receptacle 68 to be<br>
adjusted.<br>
Figs . 30 and 31 shows the eleventh form of embodiment<br>
of the present invention as an example in which the power<br>
supply housing 2a and the chemical receptacle retainer<br>
2b that make up the cartridge 2 are made separate and can<br>
be disjoinably joined together. The chemical receptacle<br>
retainer 2b is formed at its end with a pair of engagement<br>
projections 22 for engagement with corresponding holes<br>
33 formed in the apparatus main body 1. It also has a pair<br>
of rails 23a and 23a formed on its lower opposite sides<br>
for engagement with corresponding grooves 34 and 34 formed<br>
in the apparatus main body 1 in its lower inside opposite<br>
surfaces.<br>
On the other hand, the power supply housing 2a on<br>
has a pair of rails 23b and 23b formed on its outer opposite<br>
sides for engagement with the grooves 34 and 34 in the<br>
apparatus main body 1, with which the rails 23a and 23a<br>
on the chemical receptacle retainer 2b are designed to<br>
also engage.<br>
In the construction mentioned above , the cartridge<br>
2 is assembled with the apparatus main body 1 first by<br>
bringing the chemical receptacle retainer 2b loaded with<br><br>
the chemical receptacle 3 into engagement with the<br>
apparatus main body, this by engaging the engagement<br>
projections 22 with the corresponding holes 33 and engaging<br>
the two rails 23a and 23a with the corresponding grooves<br>
34 and 34.<br>
Then, the power supply housing 2a is inserted into<br>
the apparatus main body 1 first by engaging the two rails<br>
23b and 23b with the corresponding grooves 34 and 34 and<br>
sliding those rails in these grooves until the end of the<br>
power supply housing 2a comes in contact with the lower<br>
surface of the chemical receptacle retainer 2b. Then, the<br>
hook 20 formed on the outer wall 17 of the battery case<br>
13 in the power supply housing 2a is brought into engagement<br>
with the engagement protrusion piece 19 in the apparatus<br>
main body 1 to complete assembling the power supply housing<br>
2a into the apparatus main body 1.<br>
This form of embodiment enables the power supply<br>
housing 2a and the chemical receptacle retainer 2b to be<br>
exchanged individually with respect to the apparatus main<br>
body 1.<br>
Further, while in the various forms of embodiment<br>
of the present invention described in the foregoing the<br>
chemical receptacle is shown to be engaged with and thereby<br>
held by the apparatus main body by means of the chemical<br>
receptacle retainer, it is also possible to make the<br>
chemical receptacle and the chemical receptacle retainer<br>
in one piece or integrated. It is further possible to make<br>
the chemical receptacle loadable directly into the<br>
apparatus main body without intermediary of the chemical<br>
receptacle retainer.<br>
For the chemical, i.e., the active ingredient,<br>
employed in each of the various forms of embodiment of<br>
the invention described above, use may be made of an<br>
aromatic or fragrant agent, a deodorant, a microbicide,<br>
an acaricide, a harmful insect or animal repellent, an<br>
insecticide, an insectifuges, an insect growth control<br><br>
agent, a sucking action inhibitor or the like, which is<br>
volatile, singly or in a combination.<br>
For example, in killing insects, any one or more<br>
of a variety of volatile insecticides so far used may be<br>
utilized. Illustrative are pyrethroid insecticides,<br>
carbamate insecticides and organophosphorus insecticides .<br>
Pyrethroid insecticides are known to be high in safety<br>
and have been used well, of which preferred examples are<br>
