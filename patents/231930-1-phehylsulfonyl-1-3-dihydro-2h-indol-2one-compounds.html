				<td>The present invention relates to 1-phenylsulfonyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one<br>
compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to 1,3-dihydro-2if-indol-2-one derivatives, to their preparation and to their therapeutic application.<br>
The  compounds  according  to  the  present invention show affinity  for the arginine-vasopressin (AVP)  V1b  receptors  and/or  for  the  ocytocin  (OT) receptors and, furthermore, some of them show affinity for the AVP V1a receptors.<br>
AVP is a hormone which is known for its anti¬diuretic effect and its effect in regulating arterial pressure. It stimulates several types of receptors: V1 (V1a, V1b,) , V2. These receptors are located in particular in the liver, the blood vessels (coronary, renal and cerebral vessels), the platelets, the kidneys, the uterus, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, the central nervous system and the pituitary. AVP thus exerts cardiovascular, hepatic, pancreatic, antidiuretic and platelet-aggregating effects and effects on the central and peripheral nervous system, and on the uterus.<br>
OT is a neurohypophyseal hormone, of cyclic nonapeptide structure similar to that of AVP. The OT receptors are found essentially on uterine smooth muscle and on the myoepithelial cells of the mammary glands. Thus, OT plays an important role in parturition since it is involved in uterine muscle contraction and in lactation. Moreover, the OT receptors are also located on other peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system; OT may thus have effects in the cardiovascular, renal, endocrine or behavioural fields.<br>
The location of the various receptors is described in: S. Jard et al. , Vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: an overview, in Progress in Endocrinology, H. Imura   and  K.   Shizurne   ed. ,   Experta  Medica,<br><br>
Amsterdam, 1988, 1183-1188, and in the following<br>
articles: J. Lab. Clin. Med., 1989, 114 (6), 617-632<br>
and Pharmacol. Rev., 1991, £3_ (1), 73-108.<br>
More particularly, the AVP Via receptors are<br>
located in many peripheral organs and in the brain.<br>
They have been cloned in particular in rats and man and<br>
they regulate most of the known effects of AVP:<br>
platelet aggregation; uterine contractions; blood<br>
vessel contraction; secretion of aldosterone, cortisol,<br>
CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) and ACTH<br>
(adrenocorticotrophic hormone); hepatic glycogenolysis,<br>
cell proliferation and the main central effects of AVP<br>
(hypothermia, memory, etc.).<br>
The Vib receptors were initially identified in<br>
the adenohypophysis of various animal species (rat,<br>
pig, cattle, sheep, etc.), including man (S. Jard et<br>
al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1986, 30, 171-177; Y. Arsenijevic<br>
et al., J. Endocrinol., 1994, 141, 383-391; J. Schwartz<br>
et al., Endocrinology, 1991, 129 (2), 1107-1109;<br>
Y. De Keyser et al. , FEES Letters, 1994, 356, 215-220)<br>
in which they stimulate the release of adenocorticotrophic<br>
hormone via AVP and potentiate the effects of<br>
CRF on the release of ACTH (G. E. Gillies et al. ,<br>
Nature, 1982, 299, 355). In the hypothalamus, the Vib<br>
receptors also induce a direct release of CRF<br>
(Neuroendocrinology, 1994, 60, 503-508) and are, in<br>
these various respects, involved in stress situations.<br>
These Vib receptors have been cloned in rats,<br>
man and mice (Y. De Keyser, FEES Letters, 1994, 356,<br>
215-220; T. Sugimoto et al. , J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269<br>
(43), 27088-27092; M. Saito et al. , Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Res. Commun., 1995, 212 (3), 751-757; S. J. Lolait et<br>
al., Neurobiology, 1996, 92, 6783-6787; M. A. Ventura<br>
et al. , Journal of Molecular endocrinology, 1999, 22,<br>
251-260) and various studies (in situ hybridization,<br>
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), etc.) reveal the<br>
.ubiquitous presence of these receptors in various<br>
central tissues (brain, hypothalamus and<br>
adenohypophysis in particular) and peripheral tissues<br>
(kidney, pancreas, adrenal glands, heart, lungs,<br>
intestine, stomach, liver, mesentery, bladder, thymus,<br>
spleen, uterus, retina, thyroid, etc.) and in certain<br>
tumours (pituitary, pulmonary, etc. tumours) suggesting<br>
a broad biological and/or pathological role for these<br>
receptors and a potential involvement in various<br>
diseases.<br>
By way of example, in rats, studies have<br>
shown that AVP regulates the endocrine pancreas via the<br>
Vib receptors, by stimulating the secretion of insulin<br>
and glucagon (B. Lee et al., Am. J. Physiol. 269<br>
(Endocrinol. Metab. 32): E1095-E1100, 1995) or the<br>
production of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla<br>
which is the site of a local synthesis of AVP<br>
(E. Grazzini et al., Endocrinology, 1996, 137 (a),<br>
3906-3914). Thus, in the adrenal medullary tissue, AVP<br>
via these receptors is thought to have a crucial role<br>
in certain types of adrenal pheochromocytomas secreting<br>
AVP and thereby inducing a sustained production of<br>
catecholamines which is the cause of hypertension<br>
conditions that are resistant to angiotensin II<br>
receptor antagonists and to conversion enzyme<br>
inhibitors. The adrenal cortex is also rich in Via<br>
receptors involved in the production of glucocorticoids<br>
and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone and cortisol). Via<br>
these receptors, AVP (circulating or synthesized<br>
locally) may induce a production of aldosterone with an<br>
efficacy comparable to that of angiotensin II<br>
(G. Guillon et al., Endocrinology, 1995, 136 (3), 1285-<br>
1295) . Cortisol is a powerful regulator of the<br>
production of ACTH, the stress hormone.<br>
Recent studies have also shown that the<br>
adrenal glands are capable of releasing CRF and/or ACTH<br>
directly via activation of the Vib and/or Via receptors<br>
borne by the medullary cells (G. Mazzocchi et al. ,<br>
Peptides, 1997, 18 (2), 191-195; E. Grazzini et al. ,<br>
J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 1999, 84_ (6), 2195-2203).<br>
The V^ receptors are also considered as a<br>
marker of tumours. ACTH-secreting tumours, such as<br>
certain pituitary tumours, certain bronchial carcinomas<br>
(SCLCs (Small-Cell Lung Cancers)), pancreatic, adrenal<br>
and thyroid carcinomas, inducing Gushing's syndrome in<br>
certain cases (J. Bertherat et al., Eur. J.<br>
Endocrinol., 1996, 135, 173; G. A. Wittert et al. ,<br>
Lancet, 1990, 335, 991-994; G. Dickstein et al. , J.<br>
Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 1996, 8JL (8), 2934-2941)<br>
overexpress the Vis receptors. As regards the V"ia<br>
receptors, these are a marker more specific for smallcell<br>
lung cancers (SCLCs) (P. J. Woll et al. , Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Commun., 1989, 164 (1), 66-73). Thus, the<br>
compounds according to the present invention are<br>
obvious diagnostic tools and offer a novel therapeutic<br>
approach in the proliferation and detection of these<br>
tumours, even at an early stage (radiolabelling; SPECT<br>
(Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography); PET Scan<br>
(Positron Emission Tomography Scanner)).<br>
The abundant presence of the Vib receptor<br>
messenger in the stomach and intestine suggests an<br>
involvement of AVP via this receptor on the release of<br>
gastrointestinal hormones such as cholecystokinin,<br>
gastrin or secretin (T. Sugimoto et al., Molecular<br>
cloning and functional expression of Vib receptor gene,<br>
in Neurohypophysis: Recent Progress of Vasopressin and<br>
Oxytocin Research; T. Saito, K. Kurokawa and S. Yoshida<br>
ed., Elvesier Science, 1995, 409-413).<br>
1,3-Dihydro-2ff-indol-2-one derivatives have<br>
been disclosed in certain patent applications as<br>
ligands of the arginine-vasopressin receptors and/or<br>
the ocytocin receptors: mention may be made of patent<br>
applications WO 93/15051, EP 636 608, EP 636 609,<br>
WO 95/18105, WO 97/15556 and WO 98/25901.<br>
Novel 1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one derivatives<br>
have now been found, which show affinity for and<br>
selectivity towards the arginine-vasopressin Vib<br>
receptors and/or the ocytocin receptors and,<br>
furthermore, some of them show affinity for the Via<br>
receptors. These derivatives show no affinity for the<br>
AVP V2 receptors.<br>

According to another of its aspects, a<br>
subject of the present invention is a process for<br>
preparing the compounds of formula (I) , characterized<br>
in that:<br>
a compound of formula:<br>
R.<br>
in which RI, R2/ RS , R4 and X are as defined for a<br>
compound of formula (I), and:<br>
Y represents a hydroxyl or a chlorine atom when X<br>
represents a group -CH2-; -OCH2-; -NH-CH2-;<br>
-NH-CH2-CH2-;<br>
or Y represents a phenoxy when X represents a<br>
group -0-; -NH-;<br>
W represents a hydrogen atom when X represents a<br>
group -CH2-; -OCH2-;<br>
or W represents a group SCb-\' / Rv in which<br>
RS and R7 are as defined for a compound of formula<br>
(I) when X represents a group -0-; -NH- ; -NH-CH2-;<br>
-NH-CH2-CH2-;<br>
is reacted with a compound of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
in which n and R5 are as defined for a compound of<br>
formula (I) ;<br>
when W represents a group SOthe<br>
expected compound of formula (I);<br>
or, when W represents a hydrogen atom, the<br>
compound thus obtained of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
is reacted, in the presence of a base, with a sulphonyl<br>
halide of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in- which Re and R7 are as defined for a compound of<br>
formula (I) and Hal represents a halogen atom.<br>
Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is<br>
converted into a salt thereof with mineral or organic<br>
acids.<br>
When Y represents a hydroxyl, the reaction .of<br>
the compound of formula (II) with the compound of<br>
formula (III) is carried out in the presence of a<br>
coupling agent used in peptide chemistry, such as<br>
benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate and in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine,<br>
in a solvent such as dichloromethane<br>
or N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature of between<br>
0°C and room temperature.<br>
When Y represents a chlorine atom, the<br>
reaction of compound (II) with compound (III) is<br>
carried out in the absence or presence of a base such<br>
as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, in a<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane or chloroform and at a<br>
temperature of between -60°C and room temperature. In<br>
the absence of base, an excess of compound (III) is<br>
used.<br>
When Y represents a phenoxy, the reaction of<br>
compound (II) with compound (III) is carried out in a<br>
solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or<br>
tetrahydrofuran or a mixture of these solvents and at a<br>
temperature of between room temperature and the reflux<br>
temperature of-the solvent.<br>
This thus gives directly either a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a compound of formula (IV). The reaction<br>
of compound (IV) with the sulphonyl halide (V) is<br>
.carried out in the presence of a strong base, for<br>

alkali metal alkoxide such as potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylf ormamide or<br>
tetrahydrofuran and at a temperature of between -70°C<br>
and room temperature. The reaction is preferably<br>
carried out using a compound of formula (V) in which<br>
Hal represents a chlorine atom.<br>

prepared by a cyclization reaction (step bl) of a<br>
compound of formula (VII) in strong acidic medium, for<br>

the compound of formula (IX) using an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide<br>
or lithium hydroxide in a solvent such as water,<br>
methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or a<br>
mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of between<br>

By reacting compound (XXVIII) with L-leucinol<br>
(R = isobutyl) or D-leucinol or with (R)-(-)-aphenylglycinol<br>
(R = phenyl) or (S)-(+)-a-phenylglycinol,<br>
this gives, in step c7, a mixture of<br>
diastereoisomers of a compound of formula (XXIX) that<br>

compound of formula (I) in which X = -0-.<br>
When it is desired to prepare an optically<br>
pure compound of formula (I) in which -X- = .-NH-, a<br>
compound of formula (II) in which -X- = -NH-, Y =<br>
phenoxy and W = -SO^-( 7^7 is prepared in optically<br>
pure form according to the process described in<br>
Scheme 8 below in which RI, R2, Ra, R4, Re and RV are as<br>
defined for a compound of formula (I) and Hal<br>
represents a halogen atom, preferably chlorine or<br>
bromine.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
In step a8 of Scheme 8, a compound of formula<br>
(XIX) is reacted with (S) -( + ) -a-phenylglycinol or (R)-<br>
(-)-a-phenylglycinol to give a mixture of diastereoisomers<br>
of a compound of formula (XXXI) that may be<br>
separated by chromatography or crystallization.<br>
In step b8, an optically pure compound of<br>
formula (XXXII) is obtained by oxidation with lead<br>
tetraacetate and hydrolysis in acidic medium of one of<br>
the diastereoisomers of compound (XXXI).<br>
In step c8, the reaction of compound (XXXII)<br>
thus obtained with a sulphonyl halide of formula (V)<br>
followed by the reaction of compound (XXXIII) thus<br>
obtained with phenyl chloroformate (step d8) according<br>
to the methods described in WO 95/18105 gives the<br>
expected optically pure compound (II).<br>
During any one of the steps for preparing the<br>
compounds of formula (I) or the intermediate compounds<br>
of formula (II) , (III) or (IV) , it may be necessary<br>
and/or desirable to protect the reactive or sensitive<br>
functional groups, such as the amine, hydroxyl or<br>
carboxyl groups, present on any one of the molecules<br>
under consideration. This protection may be carried out<br>
using conventional protecting groups, such as those<br>
described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,<br>
J.F.W. McOmie, Ed. Plenum Press, 1973, in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M.<br>
Wutts, Ed. John Wiley and Sons, 1991 or in Protecting<br>
Groups, Kocienski P.J., 1994, Georg Thieme Verlag. The<br>
removal of the protecting groups may be carried out in<br>
a suitable subsequent step using the methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art and which do not affect the<br>
rest of the molecule under consideration.<br>
The N-protecting groups that may be used are<br>
the standard N-protecting groups that are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art, such as, for example, the<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, benzyl,<br>
benzhydrylidene or benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>

receptors was determined in vitro using the method<br>
described by Y. De Keyser et al. , FEES Letters, 1994,<br>
356, 215-220. This method consists in studying in vitro<br>
the displacement of tritiated arginine-vasopressin<br>
([3H]-AVP) at the Vib receptors present on<br>
adenohypophysal membrane or cell preparations carrying<br>
rat or human Vib receptors. The 50% inhibitory<br>
concentrations (ICso) for the attachment of tritiated<br>
arginine-vasopressin of the compounds according to the<br>
invention are low and vary from 10~6 to 1CT9 M.<br>

receptors was determined in vitro using the method<br>
described by M. Thibonnier et al. , J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
1994, 269, 3304-3310. This method consists in studying<br>
in vitro the displacement of tritiated argininevasopressin<br>
( [3H] -AVP) at the Via receptors present on<br>
membrane or cell preparations carrying rat or human Via<br>
receptors. The compounds of formula (I) exhibit an<br>
affinity for arginine-vasopressin Via receptors, with<br>
IC50 values which vary from 10~6 to 10~9 M.<br>

The compounds studied have little or no affinity for<br>
the ¥2 receptors, with ICso values which are generally<br>
greater than 10~6 M.<br>
The affinity of the compounds according to<br>
the invention for the ocytocin receptors was determined<br>
in a test of in vitro binding using the method<br>

1987, 147, 197-207. This method consists in studying in<br>
vitro the displacement of a radioiodine analogue of<br>
ocytocin to the ocytocin receptors in a cell membrane<br>
preparation transfected with the human uterine ocytocin<br>
receptor. The ICso values (concentration that inhibits<br>
50% of the binding of the radioiodine analogue of<br>
ocytocin to its receptors) are low and vary from 10~6 to<br>
10~9 M in this test.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are in<br>
particular active principles of pharmaceutical<br>

preparation of medicinal products intended for the<br>
treatment of any pathology where arginine-vasopressin<br>
and/or its Vib receptors and/or its Via receptors and/or<br>
ocytocin and/or its receptors are involved.<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the<br>
invention may be used, in man or in animals, in the<br>
treatment or prevention of various vasopressindependent<br>
conditions, such as cardiovascular<br>
conditions, ' for example hypertension, pulmonary<br>

The use of the compounds according to the<br>
invention for the prevention and/or treatment of the<br>
diseases mentioned above, and also for the preparation<br>
of medicinal products for treating these diseases,<br>
forms an integral part of the invention.<br>
The above compounds of formula (I) , or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate and/or<br>
hydrate thereof can be used at daily doses of 0.01 to<br>
100 mg per kilo of body weight of the mammal to be<br>
treated, preferably at daily doses of 0.1 to 50 mg/kg.<br>
In man, the dose can preferably vary from 0.1 to<br>
4 000 mg per day, more particularly from 0.5 to<br>
1 000 mg, depending upon the age of the subject to be<br>
treated or the type of treatment: prophylactic or<br>
curative.<br>
For their use as medicinal products, the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are generally administered in<br>
dosage units. The said dosage units are preferably<br>
formulated in pharmaceutical compositions in which the<br>
active principle is mixed with one or more<br>
pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects,<br>
the present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions including, as active principle, a compound<br>
of formula (I) , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
solvate and/or hydrate thereof, and also one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention for administration by the oral,<br>
sublingual, inhaled, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous, transdermal, local or rectal route, the<br>
active principles can be administered in single-dose<br>
administration forms, as a mixture with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles, to animals and human beings.<br>
The appropriate single-dose administration forms<br>
comprise forms by the oral route, such as tablets,<br>
gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions<br>
or suspensions, sublingual and buccal administration<br>
forms, aerosols, topical administration forms,<br>
implants, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous,<br>
intranasal or intraocular administration forms and<br>
rectal administration forms.<br>
The active principle of formula (I) is<br>
present in each dosage unit in the amounts suited to<br>
the daily doses envisaged. In general, each dosage unit<br>
is suitably adjusted according to the dosage and the<br>
type of administration provided, for example tablets,<br>
gelatin capsules and the like, sachets, blisters,<br>
syrups and the like, or drops, so that such a dosage<br>
unit comprises from 0.1 to 1 000 mg of active<br>
principle, preferably from 0.5 to 250 mg, which has to<br>
be administered one to four times daily.<br>
Although these dosages are examples of<br>
average situations, there may be specific cases where<br>
higher or lower dosages are appropriate; such dosages<br>
also form part of the invention. According to the usual<br>
practice, the dosage appropriate to each patient is<br>
determined by the physician according to the method of<br>
administration and the age, the weight and the response<br>
of the said patient.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the<br>
present invention also relates to a method for treating<br>
the pathologies indicated above, which comprises the<br>
administration, to a patient, of an effective dose of a<br>
compound according to the invention - . or a<br>
