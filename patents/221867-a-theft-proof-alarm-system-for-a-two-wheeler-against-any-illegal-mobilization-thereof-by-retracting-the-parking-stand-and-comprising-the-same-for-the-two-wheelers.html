				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to "a theft proof alarm system for a two-wheeler against any illegal mobilisation thereof by retracting the parking-stand and comprising the same for the two-wheelers".<br>
In any known two-wheeler, there is a normal practice done by putting the parking-stand (with on-stand condition) for vehicle parking. The vehicle will be released from the on-stand position to the off-stand position by retracting the parking-stand for any mobilization. Even when the vehicle was steering locked against the theft-occurrence during parking, there is the possibility to mobilize any known vehicle by the thief or thieves by normally retracting or relieving the parking-stand from the ground and then lifting any one of the wheels. The mobilization of any known vehicle is possible only after retracting or relieving the parking-stand of the locked vehicle. It has not been absolutely possible so far to prevent this kind of theft or the possibility thereof, even in the vehicle with steering locked condition.<br>
According to this invention, a theft proof alarm system for a two-wheeler against any illegal mobilisation thereof by retracting the parking-stand and comprising the same for the two-wheelers, comprises a limit-switch or each of a plurality thereof provided, spring-loaded and rigidly connected to the parking-stand-bracket as a part of the vehicle, said switch is operatively connected between an electric-power source and a theft alarm system wherein said limit-switch is loaded by said parking-stand by means of switch-off condition at on-stand position, against the said spring which is provided in said limit-switch to normally release the said limit-switch for switch-on condition so as to close the electric-power circuit to operate the theft aleirm system as a caution against the theft occurrence, only when the said parking-stand was retracted to off-stand position for the purpose of any illegal mobilization as the theft, there is also a manual switch integrally provided with any known type of ignition switch with one more theft-lock mode and operatively connected between said electric-power source and said theft alarm system in series with said limit switch so as to<br><br>
switch-on or to activate the said alarm system only when the parking-stand was retracted for any mobilization as the theft and only after the rider switched the said manual switch with theft-lock-on condition after ignition-off or with steering-locking by the ignition key.<br>
The invention will now be apparent from the following non-limitative description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURED 1 and 2     respectively show pictorial and orthographic<br>
views of an arrangement comprising a limit-switch connected to centre-stand-bracket and its mounting bracket as a part of a two-wheeler during on-stand condition of the centre-stand according to this invention;<br>
FIGURE^S 3 and 4     respectively show pictorial and orthographic<br>
views of the above said arrangement during off-stand condition of the said centre-stand;<br>
FIGURE 5A &amp; 5B       respectively show schematic circuit diagrams<br>
of the arrangement of said limit-switches connected to the centre-stand and both centre-stand and side-stand, theft alarm system, electric-power source and theft-locking switch;<br>
FIGURE^S 6 to 8        respectively show pictorial and orthographic<br>
views (front and side views) of an arrangement comprising a limit-switch connected to side-stand-bracket with on-stand condition according to this invention;<br>
FIGURED 9 and 10   respectively show orthographic sectional views<br>
of above said arrangement (along the pivot axis) detailing a limit-switch connected to side-stand-bracket with on-stand and off-stand conditions according to this invention;<br><br>
Referring to FIGURES 1 to 4, according to this invention, there is provided a limit-switch 1, which is spring-loaded and rigidly connected to the centre stand-bracket 2 as a part of the vehicle. The said switch 1 is also operatively connected between an electric-power source 4 and a theft alarm system 5 through electrical cables 5A as shown in Figure 5A. The said limit-switch 1 is kept in switch-off condition by means of the centre-stand 3 pressing over the said switch 1 during its on-stand position as shown in Figures 1 and 2. There is normally provided a return-spring in said limit switch (not shown in figure), which is to normally release the said limit-switch 1 for switch-on condition during its off-stand position as shown in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
There is also a manual switch 6 integrally provided with any known tj^e of ignition switch 7 with one more lock mode named by theft-lock mode 6A along with hand-lock. The said manual switch 6 is operatively connected between said electric-power source 4 and said theft alarm system 5 in series with said limit switch 1. The said limit switch 1 is capable of working or being activated to operate the said alarm system 5 during a theft-attempt, only after the rider switched-on the said manual switch 6 in theft-lock-mode 6A which is after ignition-off mode 6B or with steering-lock mode 6C by^the ignition key while parking. When the centre-stand 3 is retracted for any illegal mobilization of the vehicle, the electric-circuit is closed which in turn operating the theft-alarm system 5 as a caution.<br>
Further the said theft-lock mode is also provided after ignition-off or steering-lock mode either in the ignition-lock system or in the steering-lock system respectively of separate ignition and steering locking systems type of vehicle.<br>
Still further the theft-lock mode is also provided in a separate control switch with a control key or with a lever-type knob. The said lever-type knob control i^ provided no key control and confidentially inside a utility box or storage container or any other interior place and the location of which is to particularly be known only by the customers.<br><br>
Normally the vehicle is put with centre-stand by the customer/rider after<br>
switching-off the ignition control for the parking purpose. According to this<br>
invention, it is then followed by using the said ignition-switch to switch-on<br>
theft locking with or after hand locking for taking out the key. So the theft-<br>
lock circuit will be closed for activating the limit-switch connected with<br>
centre-stand.   After   the	rider   moves   away   from   there,   and<br>
whenever this vehicle is perhaps made with any theft attempt by mobilizing the Vehicle, it will be possible only after retracting the centre-stand of this vehicle, which has been with handle-locked. When the centre-stand is retracted to off-stand position from on-stand position, then the said limit-switch is made^to release itself by its spring-load to close the theft-alarm circuit to activate the theft alarm system by the theft-warning or indication or caution of theft-attempt. Then the theft-attempt or occurrence will simultaneously be identified to prevent the theft or capture the causes of the theft-occurrence (the persons who have attempted).<br>
Further, after parking when the same	rider desires to take the<br>
vehicle back, he should first release the theft-lock mode using the ignition-<br>
key before retracting the centre-stand to	mobilize the vehicle. Then it<br>
will obviously open the theft-lock circuit for its deactivation. Then even<br>
when the centre-stand is retracted to its off-stand condition only by the<br>
" rider or for any legal usage, the theft-alarm system will<br>
not do any function against the customer while in use.<br>
Further, in some of the two-wheelers, the side-stand may be used for parking purpose. With the above system, when the customer parks his two-wheeler using side-stand, then the centre-stand is inherently kept in off-stand condition even during the theft-lock condition resulting theft alarm system starts functioning (warning) wrongly as a trouble against its actual purpose. Hence it is to be needed for another similar system for the vehicles having both centre and side stand systems. Otherwise the customers (end-users) cannot substantially utilise this invention fully without any trouble.<br><br>
In further preferred embodiment of this invention as shown in Figures 6 to 10, another spring loaded limit switch 2 as similar and described in herein above, is rigidly connected to the side-stand or a part thereof 8 so as to ever slideably contact the surface 10 of the side-stand bracket 9 which is perpendicular to the stand-pivot-axis. As shown in Figure 5B, the said later side-stand-limit switch 2 is also electrically connected between the said electric power source 4 and the said theft alarm system 5 in series with said former centre-stand-limit switch 1.<br>
The function of this later limit switch 2 is based on only the angular position of the side-stand with respect to its pivot-mounting bracket 9. This said angular position of side stand is defined by the angular position of the stand 8 defined in a plane, which is perpendicular to the said contact surface 10. Also the position of said later limit-switch 2 is defined in such a way that it should be on the part of said side-stand 8, where there is a gap between the side-stand bracket and side-stand when the side-stand is not supported by the ground irrespective of stand on-stand or off-stand position. As shown in Figure 9, as long as the side-stand 8 is not supported by the ground for usage, the later limit-switch 2 is operated to switch-on condition. Then the electric-circuit will close resulting in the functioning the theft-alarm system 5. When the side-stand 8 is supported by the ground in on-stand condition for the parking purpose, then the said later limit-switch 2 is actuated by the assembly of both stand with bracket to open the electric-circuit as shown in Figure 10.<br>
According to this invention, the vehicle having both centre-stand and side-stand systems is used with at least any one of the said stands 3 and 8 for the parking purpose. Then the electric-circuit is opened by the limit-switch connected to the stand, which is then used for parking by releasing. During any parking time, only any one of the stands is used for the parking particularly supporting the vehicle. Then the other stand not being used is still closing the electric-circuit by its actuation and the first stand being used opens the electric-circuit by its actuation during parking. When any one attempts to illegally mobilize the vehicle by relieving the stand, which is<br><br>
being used, it will close the electric circuit by its actuation. Then, this fesults in the indication of caution or warning alarm against this theft or its intention.<br>
This arrangement of limit-switch on side-stand assembly is characterised that when the vehicle is perhaps being parked with centre-stand also with keeping the side-stand in released condition by in mistake, the theft-alarm system is effectively activated for its function without any fail during any illegal mobilisation thereof. Also when the vehicle being parked with side-stand is attempted any theft by any mobilisation, then this system immediately activates theft-alarm system by indicating the warning or caution against this theft activity or its intention. Hence the arrangement of limit-switch assembly on the side-stand system and the electric-circuit diagram with limit- switches on both centre- stand and side- stand, substantially make this invention with foolproof system against any tricky method which may be applied for illegal mobilisation of this vehicle.<br>
