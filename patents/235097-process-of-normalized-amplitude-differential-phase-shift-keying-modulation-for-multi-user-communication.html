NORMALISED COHERENT AMPLITUDE AMD DIFFERENTIAL PHASE MODULATION<br>
METHOD FOR MULTIUSER COMMUNICATIONS<br>
As expressed in the title of this specification, the<br>
present invention refers to a process for standardized<br>
differential in-phase and coherent in amplitude modulation for<br>
multiuser communication.<br>
The process of the invention is applicable to communication<br>
systems irrespective of the physical medium that they use for<br>
the communication and the main characteristics thereof consist<br>
of allowing adaptation to the maximum transmission capacity<br>
offered by the channel, carrying out a follow-up of the<br>
amplitude variations thereof and allowing transmission from one<br>
to several users in an efficient way, facilitating the<br>
implementation of a low complexity modulator and demodulator.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In telecommunication systems in order to send information<br>
by way of a communication channel it is usually necessary to<br>
modulate said information; in other words, to adequate and adapt<br>
the information to the channel.<br>
Some of the main problems that a digital communication<br>
receiver encounters are equalization that entails an estimation<br>
of the channel, and the deviation in frequency of the clock of<br>
the receiver with respect to the transmitter. When coherent QAM<br>
modulations (quadrature amplitude modulation) are used, it is<br>
necessary to greatly increment the complexity of the demodulator<br>
in order to challenge the above-cited problems. One solution<br>
consists of using differential modulations or DAPSK<br>
(differential amplitude phase modulation) wherein the<br>
information is encoded in the increments of amplitude and phase.<br>
This differential encoding eliminates the need of the estimation<br>
of the reception channel and minimizes to a large degree the<br>
effects of deviation of frequency between the clocks of the<br>
transmitter and of the receiver. But this reduction in<br>
complexity of the receiver when using totally differential<br>
modulation entails an increment in the probability of bit error<br><br>
2<br>
for the same value of SNR (Signal-to-Noise-Ratio) with respect<br>
to the performance of the QAM modulations.<br>
On the other hand, ADPSK modulation (amplitude differential<br>
phase modulation) is known in the prior art just as it appears<br>
in "Comparison and optimization of differentially encoded<br>
transmission on fading channels", L. Lampe and R. Fischer,<br>
Proceedings ISPLC'99; "Performance evaluation of noncoherent<br>
transmission over power lines", L. Lampe, R. Fisher and R.<br>
Schober, Proceedings ISPLC'OO; and "Differential encoding<br>
strategies for transmission over fading channels", R. Fischer,<br>
L. Lampe and S. Calabro, International Journal on Electronics<br>
and Communications.<br>
Said modulation is a modulation mixed between the two<br>
preceding ones (QAM and DAPSK), and represents a middle point,<br>
as far as the performance and complexity of the receiver is<br>
concerned, between both. In other words, it minimizes the<br>
problem posed by the deviation of frequency between the clocks<br>
of the transmitter and receiver of a digital communication<br>
system and reduces the complexity of the estimation of the<br>
channel, since it is only necessary to estimate the channel in<br>
amplitude. Therefore, ADPSK modulation represents the best<br>
compromise between performance and complexity of the receiver<br>
for a practical implementation.<br>
On the other hand, if one desires to always obtain the<br>
maximum data transfer rate, it is necessary to adapt the bits<br>
per carrier of the modulation to the capacity offered by the<br>
channel. In other words, given the probability of objective bit<br>
error it is sought to use the maximum number of bits per carrier<br>
to ensure a probability of error equal to or lower than this<br>
value. Furthermore, in a multipoint to point multiuser<br>
communication or multipoint to multipoint, a transmitter can<br>
send information to several receivers through different channels<br>
in a single data frame. Therefore, in a single frame different<br>
constellations will be used. Another important factor to achieve<br>
this maximum data transfer rate is to minimize the overhead<br><br>
3<br>
(control information of the system necessary for correct<br>
reception of the data and that it is sent together therewith) .<br>
This overhead is more important if transmission strategies based<br>
on the use of multiple carrier such as OFDM (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexity) are used where the times of<br>
symbols are much longer and contain much more information than<br>
in a digital communication wherein a single frequency<br>
information carrier is used.<br>
ADPSK modulation has two important requirements. This first<br>
one is that, due to the fact that part of the information is<br>
encoded in the phase increments, it is necessary to previously<br>
send a symbol that constitutes a phase reference for the<br>
receiver. Likewise, the rest of the information is encoded in<br>
the value of the amplitude of the symbol received. Therefore,<br>
the second requirement is that it is necessary to estimate the<br>
value of the amplitude of the response of the channel to correct<br>
the effect thereof on the receiver. Besides, the real channels<br>
have a certain variation of their characteristics with time,<br>
which forces the receiver to carry out a follow-up and updating<br>
of the initial estimation.<br>
The above-cited articles describe the operation of the<br>
ADPSK modulator and demodulator and the performance thereof, and<br>
does not describe the possibility of using different<br>
constellations within a single data frame. In this latter case,<br>
in order to change the constellation it would be necessary to<br>
send a new phase reference or increment to a large degree the<br>
complexity of the modulator, which hampers the practical<br>
implementation thereof and prevents optimum multiuser<br>
communication. The process of the invention filed solves this<br>
problem, permitting a single phase reference to be sent at the<br>
beginning of the frame and facilitating practical implementation<br>
of the low complexity modulator.<br>
Likewise, the invention permits the insertion of data<br>
symbols in the frame in such a way that users to whom the<br>
transmitter data are not going to be directed can monitor the<br><br>
4<br>
channel and follow the variations thereof.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to achieve the aims and avoid the drawbacks<br>
indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the invention consists of<br>
a process for standardized differential in-phase and coherent in<br>
amplitude modulation applicable in any communication system that<br>
carries out bidirectional communications of user■s multiple<br>
equipment. In this modulation the information is modulated in<br>
the value of the amplitude and the phase increments and requires<br>
a phase reference symbol to be sent prior to sending information<br>
symbols, just as it has been described in the preceding section.<br>
The invention is characterized in that the information to be<br>
modulated in the phase difference, that belongs to the possible<br>
information set according to the number of phases of the<br>
constellation to be used, an injective application is carried<br>
out between this set and the set of information possible to be<br>
modulated corresponding to the constellation with the maximum<br>
number of phases. This application consists of a projection of<br>
the elements of the first set in the same number of elements of<br>
the second set that produces the maximum separation, measured in<br>
radians, of the points resulting from the constellation with the<br>
maximum number of phases. In this way, the information of input<br>
into the phase differential modulator belongs to this second<br>
set.<br>
Equalization of the channel, that is carried out in the<br>
reception, is carried out in two steps, wherein the first one<br>
consists of obtaining an initial estimation of the attenuation<br>
of the channel, and the second one carries out the follow-up and<br>
reduction of the residual error of the first estimation by means<br>
of applying an adaptive algorithm.<br>
In reception, in order to carry out the initial estimation<br>
of the attenuation of the channel, the phase reference symbol is<br>
used and a certain number of the following symbols received.<br>
This set of symbols, formed by the reference, and a number of<br>
symbols following the reference set, has an amplitude value<br><br>
5<br>
known in advance. The estimation is carried out by means of the<br>
accumulation of the amplitudes of the symbols that form the set<br>
and the mean by the number of symbols that comprise said set.<br>
Besides, thanks to the process of the invention, in these<br>
symbols following the reference symbol, information encoded in<br>
the phase difference is sent, whereby these symbols are used to<br>
send information and to carry out the initial estimation of the<br>
attenuation of the channel.<br>
On the other hand, this initial estimation of the<br>
attenuation of the channel is used as an initial input to an<br>
adaptive algorithm that permits the changes of channel amplitude<br>
to be followed and the error made in the first estimation to be<br>
reduced from the modulated information received.<br>
In order to improve this follow-up of the channel, and so<br>
that users who are not receivers of the information can carry<br>
out said follow-up, symbols with encoded phase and amplitude<br>
information known in certain instants indicated by the<br>
transmitter to the receiver are inserted in the frame.<br>
The described process of the invention permits practical ?<br>
implementation of an optimum multiuser communication system,<br>
minimizing the overhead and reducing the modulator and<br>
demodulator complexity upon permitting the constellation or user<br>
to be changed in a single frame. Furthermore, it facilitates the<br>
sending of information in the symbols used for the estimation of<br>
the amplitude or attenuation of the channel. Likewise, it<br>
permits the initial estimation of the channel to be updated to<br>
the users who are not receivers of the information. In this way,<br>
the variation thereof can be followed in time by means of the<br>
insertion of symbols in the known amplitude frame, but with<br>
information on the phase increment.<br>
Hereinafter to provide a better understanding of this<br>
specification and forming an integral part thereof, some figures<br>
wherein the object of the invention has been represented in an<br>
illustrative and non-restrictive manner are accompanied.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter a description of an embodiment of the invention<br>
is made, making reference to the numbering used in the figures.<br>
As it has been commented on in the section on the<br>
background of the invention, ADPSK modulation is a mixed<br>
modulation between DAPSK (differential) modulations and QAM<br>
(coherent) modulations. Hence, the bits to be modulated are<br>
converted into amplitudes ak {information to be modulated into<br>
amplitude), and in Abk phase increments (information to be<br>
modulated in the phase increment), assuming that the M<br>
constellation points are distributed in R rings and P phases,<br>
according to the following formulae:<br>
{ (ak, AbJ, k = ...,0,1,2,... },<br>
wherein:<br>
ak e {0,l,...,fi-l}<br>
Abk e (O,1,...,P-1)<br>
The low-pass equivalent of the modulated value will be:<br>
Wherein A is the displacement of the first ring with respect to<br>
the center, \i is the factor that modifies the separation between<br>
the rings, and<br><br>
7<br>
is made, making reference to the numbering used in the figures.<br>
As it has been commented on in the section on the<br>
background of the invention, ADPSK modulation is a mixed<br>
modulation between DAPSK (differential) modulations and QAM<br>
(coherent) modulations. Hence, the bits to be modulated are<br>
converted into amplitudes ak (information to be modulated into<br>

'according to the following formulae:<br>
{ (ak, Abk), k = ...,0,1,2,... },<br>
wherein:<br>
ak e {0,l,...,H-l}<br>
Abk e {0,1,..., F~l}<br>
: The low-pass equivalent of the modulated value will be:<br><br>
Wherein A is the displacement of the first ring with respect to<br>
the center, p is the factor that modifies the separation between<br>
the rings, and<br><br>
)That is used to standardize the constellation to power unit.<br>
Y:<br>
bk = (bk_!+ Abk)mod P<br>
Which represents the differential character of the phase. The<br>
lvalues of R, p, A and p determine the geometry of the<br>
constellation and, therefore, the performance thereof. The<br>
optimum values are obtained by minimizing the probability of bit<br><br>
8<br>
error in reception. For each value of p there is a value of A<br>
that minimizes said probability, and therefore, in order to<br>
simplify the calculations in this embodiment of the process of<br>
the invention p is established to be 1 and consequently the<br>
5preceding equations remain:<br><br>
The optimum value for each constellation, in this<br>
embodiment, is the following:<br>
10<br><br>
Bits	Bmntw		A	mu<br>
2	4	4x1	1	1<br>
3	8	4x2	0,8	1<br>
4	16	8x2	1.7	1<br>
5	32	8X4	1.7	1<br>
6	64	16x4	2.5	1<br>
Given the characteristics of the modulation, the<br>
demodulator needs a phase reference in order to begin to<br>
demodulate the encoded bits in the phase increments, and an<br>
estimation of the attenuation of the channel in order to<br>
equalize the amplitude and in order to be able to demodulate the<br>
bits encoded therein. In this embodiment, multiple carriers<br>
(OFDM) are used and each carrier is modulated in ADPSK in order<br>
to implement a point to multipoint communication. In an OFDM<br><br>
9<br>
injective application explained above is carried out by a block<br>
(4) and AJb '^ (11) is obtained. For the optimum constellations<br>
described above, the quotient ^ax__f P is a power of two,<br>
therefore, only the input value (1) has to be displaced in terms<br>
of the bits per carrier (3). By means of a block (5), the<br>
differential phase modulation is implemented in the following<br>
manner:<br>
wherein Jbjt.^ (16) is the phase value of the preceding symbol,<br>
obtained in a memory block (9), to which the phase increment hbk<br>
(11) is applied thereto in order to obtain the absolute phase<br>
value bk (15) . As it has been explained above, it is necessary<br>
to send a phase reference at the beginning of the frame. For<br>
this purpose, the signal that indicates the sending of the phase<br>
reference (17) controls a switch (14) in order to select between<br>
the input value &amp;bk (11) or the result of the increment bk (15) .<br>
This output value (18) is kept in the memory (9) in order to use<br>
it in the following symbol. Therefore, Sk will be the following<br>
in the reference phase: .<br>
Sk = A (A+ak) ej
An efficient implementation of the modulator requires a<br>
memory (7) with 2 Pmax positions that contain the following<br>
values:<br>
But the size of the memory (7) can be reduced to Pmax / 4<br>
+1 taking the following trigonometric ratios into account:<br><br>
10<br>
of the bits per carrier (3) . By means of a block (5) , the<br>
differential phase modulation is implemented in the following<br>
manner:<br><br>
wherein b Vi (16) is the phase value of the preceding symbol,<br>
obtained in a memory block (9) , to which the phase increment<br>
Ab 'k (11) is applied thereto in order to obtain the absolute<br>
phase value b ' k (15) . As it has been explained above, it is<br>
necessary to send a phase reference at the beginning of the<br>
frame. For this purpose, the signal that indicates the sending<br>
of the phase reference (17) controls a switch (14) in order to<br>
select between the input value Ajb' k (11) or the result of the<br>
increment b'k (15). This output value (18) is kept in the memory<br>
(9) in order to use it in the following symbol. Therefore, Sk<br>
will be the following in the reference phase:<br>
Sk = A(A+ak)ei{(2n/Fmax)Ab<k></k>
An efficient implementation of the modulator requires a<br>
memory (7) with 2 Praax positions that contain the following<br>
values:<br><br>
But the size of the memory (7) can be reduced to Pmax/4 -hi<br>
taking the following trigonometric ratios into account:<br><br>
11<br><br>
containing only<br><br>
A block (8) converts the signal (18) into two suitable<br>
indexes to index the memory (7) and to obtain (19) and (20).<br>
The information to be modulated in amplitude, a* (2) , and<br>
the number of bits per carrier (3) determine the value of the<br>
amplitude to be obtained in a memory (6). The memory (6)<br>
contains the values X (A+aj) (21) , therefore, it has as many<br>
positions as the sum of the possible number of all the<br>
constellations that are used. If the signal (17) indicates that<br>
it is necessary to send a phase reference, the amplitude<br>
corresponding to the constellation of 2 bits per carrier, that<br>
only has information in the phase and has a known amplitude, is<br>
selected. This phase reference symbol is one of the ones that<br>
are used in reception order to estimate the channel. Finally,<br>
the modulator composes the component in phase (12) and in<br>
quadrature (13) by means of some multipliers (10).<br>
Figure 3 shows the frame structure that is used in the<br>
multiuser in this embodiment of the invention. The first symbol<br>
(44)	is the phase reference, followed by a series of symbols<br>
(45)	modulated with 2 bits per carrier and that can be directed<br>
to all the possible receiving users. The set formed by said<br>
symbols (45) and the phase reference (44) is likewise used in<br>
the receiver of each one of them for the initial estimation of<br>
the channel. The symbols (45) carry information modulated in the<br><br>
phase, thus reducing the overhead of the channel estimation.<br>
Afterwards, data symbols (46) are sent that can be directed to a<br>
specific user or a set of them, modulated with a certain number<br>
of bits per carrier. Besides, known amplitude symbols (which in<br>
this embodiment are modulated with 2 bits per carrier) are<br>
inserted in the frame. This modulation is known by all the<br>
equipment that implement the process of the invention) (47) so<br>
that the users who have not been receivers of the preceding data<br>
symbols (46) can update their estimations of the channel<br>
amplitude and thus follow up the variations thereof. Once again,<br>
these symbols carry information modulated in the phase.<br>
Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the demodulator of the<br>
multiuser communication system for this embodiment of the<br>
process of the invention. The modulated low pass signal received<br>
(21) is converted into polar signals in a block (22) obtaining<br>
the phase &amp;k (2 4) and the amplitude received Ak (23) received.<br>
The phase increment, AQ'k (28) , is obtained by means of a<br>
subtractor (27) that subtracts the phase received, <pk the></pk>
phase of the preceding symbol, &amp;k-X (26) , that is obtained from a<br>
20memory (25) wherein it was previously stored:<br><br>
After this operation, the phase received, Ok (24) , is<br>
always kept in the memory (25) in the position wherein &amp;k-i was.<br>
This phase increment (28) is accompanied by noise, for which<br>
reason it is necessary to determine to which of the transmitted<br>
possible increments it corresponds. A phase detector (2 9)<br>
carries out this task by selecting the closest one, as far as<br>
Euclidean distance is concerned, as the transmitted increment<br>
(43) , from the one received 4<pk . the number of bits></pk>
constellation (31) determines the set of possible phase<br>
increments transmitted.<br>
On the other hand, by means of a signal (30), the detector<br>
(29) in the phase reference symbol is incapacitated.<br><br>
13<br>
The amplitude received, Ak (23), is processed differently<br>
since it does not have a differential nature. First it is<br>
necessary to carry out an estimation of the attenuation of the<br>
channel in order to be able to equalize the amplitude received<br>
and detect it. The estimation of the channel is carried out by<br>
means of a block (36) .<br>
The channel estimator (36) calculates a mean during the<br>
first S symbols ( (44) and (45) ) and calculates the weight<br>
necessary to equalize the amplitude, w (39), in the following<br>
way:<br><br>
In order to increase the values of Ak (23) and in order to<br>
maintain the calculated weight w (39) that will be applied for<br>
the symbol S+l, a memory (37), from which the same positions may<br>
be reused is used. The channel estimation signal (33) indicates<br>
during which symbols it is necessary to calculate the mean.<br>
Besides, a block (35) is incapacitated by means of the one that<br>
updates the weights w (39) , and an amplitude detector (32) ,<br>
given that the value of the weight needed to equalize the<br>
amplitude is being calculated. The amplitude received Ak (23) is<br>
equalized by a multiplier (38) in order to obtain the input<br>
amplitude value A* (41), and to' apply it to the amplitude<br>
detector (32). The amplitude inputted into the detector, Ak (41),<br>
is accompanied by noise; therefore the detector (32) must<br>
determine at what amplitude of the possible ones transmitted it<br>
corresponds. The bits per carrier of the constellation (31)<br>
determine the set of possible amplitudes transmitted. The<br>
detected amplitude Ak (42) is the closest one, as far as the<br>
Euclidean distance is concerned, from the equalized one<br>
received, A* (41). Likewise, the amplitude detector (32)<br><br>

applicable in bidrectional communication of user multiple<br>
equipment wherein a differential in-phase and coherent in<br>
amplitude modulation, that requires the sending of a phase<br>
reference symbol prior to the sending of information, is used,<br>
characterized in that the information to be modulated in the<br>
phase difference, that belongs to the set of possible<br>
information according to the number of phases of the<br>
constellation to be' used, an injective application is carried<br>
out between this set and the set of information possible to be<br>
modulated corresponding to the constellation with the maximum<br>
number of phases, consisting of a projection of the elements of<br>
the first set in the same number of elements of the second set<br>
that produce the maximum separation, measured in radians, of the<br>
points resulting from the constellation with the maximum number<br>
of phases; so that the information inputted in the phase<br>
differential modulator belongs to this second set, and thus<br>
minimize the overhead (information to control the system<br>
necessary for a correct reception of the data and that is sent<br>
along therewith), and to optimize the change of constellation or<br>
user within a single frame.<br>
2.	Process for standardized differential in-phase and<br>
coherent in amplitude modulation for multiuser communication,<br>
according to claim 1, wherein equalization is done in reception,<br>
characterized in that the equalization of the channel is done in<br>
two steps, wherein the first one carries out an initial<br>
estimation of the attenuation of the channel, and the second one<br>
carries out the follow-up and reduction of residual error of<br>
said estimation by an adaptive algorithm.<br>
3.- Process for standardized differential in-phase and<br>
coherent in amplitude modulation for multiuser communication,<br>
according to claim 2, characterized in that the initial<br>
estimation of the attenuation of the channel is carried out by<br><br>
15<br>
using the phase reference symbol and a certain number of the<br>
following symbols received, wherein the symbols of the set<br>
formed by the reference symbol and the following symbols have an<br>
amplitude value known in advance; said estimation being carried<br>
out by the accumulation of amplitudes received from the symbols<br>
of the set and the mean between the number of symbols that<br>
comprise said set.<br>
4.	- Process for standardized differential in-phase and<br>
coherent in amplitude modulation for multiuser communication,<br>
according to claim 3, characterized in that encoded information<br>
is sent in the phase difference in the symbols used for the<br>
initial estimation of the attenuation of the channel following<br>
the phase reference.<br>
5.	- Process for standardized differential in-phase and<br>
coherent in amplitude modulation for multiuser communication,<br>
according to claim 3, characterized in that the estimation of<br>
the attenuation of the channel is used as an initial input into<br>
a adaptive algorithm in order to follow the changes of amplitude<br>
of the channel from the modulated information received and to<br>
reduce the error made in the first estimation.<br>
6.	- Process for standardized differential in-phase and<br>
coherent in amplitude modulation for multiuser communication,<br>
according to claim 1, characterized in that known amplitude<br>
symbols are sent and with in-phase encoded information at<br>
certain instants indicated by the transmitter to the receiver,<br>
in order to selectively improve the amplitude estimation, the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio or both.<br><br><br>
It is characterized in that the information to be modulated<br>
in the phase difference, that belongs to the set of information<br>
possible according to the number of phases of the constellation<br>
to be used, an injective application between this set and the<br>
set of information possible to be modulated corresponding to the<br>
constellation with the maximum number of phases is carried out.<br>
This permits bits to be changed by a carrier without sending a<br>
new phase reference, to maximize the number of symbols of<br>
information within the frame and to implement a modulator and a<br>
low complexity modulator and demodulator.<br>
Applicable in multiuser digital communication that requires<br>
bits to be changed by the carrier of the constellation in one<br>
single data frame, in order to adapt to the maximum transmission<br>
capacity of the channel, to follow the amplitude variations<br>
thereof and to allow information to be transmitted from one to<br>
several users.<br></td>
