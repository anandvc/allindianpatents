				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONDEVICE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the technical<br>
field of radio communication, and more specifically<br>
relates to a radio communication apparatus and a method<br>
foruse in a communication system where packet scheduling<br>
is carried out on the downlink.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the third generation communication scheme,<br>
typically such as IMT-2000 (International Mobile<br>
Telecommunications-2000), in particular, a faster and<br>
higher-capacity downlink is sought, and for example, the<br>
information transmission rate of higher than or equal<br>
to 2 Mbps is achieved by using the frequency band of 5<br>
MHz.  IMT-2000 adopts the single carrier Wideband-Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) scheme.  Alternately,<br>
some scheme called High Speed Downlink Packet Access<br>
(HSDPA) may be employed.  In HSDPA, the Adaptive<br>
Modulation and channel Coding (AMC) scheme, MAC layer<br>
packet Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme, fast packet<br>
scheduling and others are employed to achieve higher<br>
transmission rates and higher quality.  For example, AMC<br>
is described in non-patent document 1.  ARQ is described<br>
in non-patent document 2 .<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view for explaining the AMC<br>
scheme. Assuming that transmission power from a base<br>
station is fixed, in general, a terminal 11 closer to<br>
a base station 10 can receive signals with greater power<br>
than a terminal 12 far from the base station 10. Hence,<br>
since it is estimated that the terminal 11 has a better<br>
1<br><br>
channel state, a greater modulation level and a higher<br>
coding rate are adopted. On the other hand, the terminal<br>
12 receives signals with less power than the terminal<br>
11. Thus, since it is estimated that the terminal 12 does<br>
not have a good channel state, a smaller modulation level<br>
and a lower coding rate are adopted.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an exemplary combination of different<br>
modulation schemes (modulation level) and different<br>
channel coding rates.  In the illustrated table, the<br>
rightmost column represents relative bit rates in the<br>
case of the bit rate being "l" under the modulation scheme<br>
M of "QPSK" and the channel coding rate R of "1/3".  For<br>
example, if M="QPSK" and R="l/2", the bit rate of X1.5<br>
is obtained.  In general, there is tendency that the<br>
higher bit rate is, the less reliability is.  More<br>
specifically, combinations between different modulation<br>
schemes and the coding rates and different amounts<br>
indicative of channel states are predefined in a listing<br>
table, and the modulation schemes and others are changed<br>
depending on the channel state if needed.  The amount<br>
indicative of the channel state is managed as Channel<br>
Quality Indicator (CQI), which is typically SIR (Signal<br>
to Interference power Ratio) and SINR of a received<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic view for explaining the ARQ<br>
(more accurately, hybrid ARQ) .  The hybrid ARQ scheme is<br>
a technique derived from a combination of the ARQ scheme<br>
of requesting retransmission of packets depending on<br>
results of error detection (CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check)<br>
and some error correction coding scheme (also referred<br>
to as channel coding) for error correction.  As<br>
illustrated, a CRC bit is added to a transmission data<br>
sequence S1), and the resulting signal is sent after<br>
completion of error correction encoding (S2).  In<br>
2<br><br>
response to receipt of the signal, error correction<br>
decoding (also referred to as "channel decoding") is<br>
carried out (S3) , and error detection is carried out (S4) .<br>
If some error is detected, retransmission of the packet<br>
is requested to the transmitting side (S5).  As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, there are several methods for such<br>
retransmission.<br>
In an exemplary method illustrated in FIG. 4A,<br>
packet P1 is sent from the transmitting side to the<br>
receiving side.  If some error is detected at the<br>
receiving side, the packet P1 is discarded and then the<br>
retransmission is requested.  In response to the<br>
retransmission request, the transmitting side resends<br>
the same packet (represented as "P2") as the packet P1.<br>
In an exemplary method illustrated in FIG. 4 B,<br>
packet P1 is sent from the transmitting side to the<br>
receiving side.  If some error is detected at the<br>
receiving side, the receiving side keeps the packet P1<br>
without discarding it.  In response to the<br>
retransmission request, the transmitting side resends<br>
the same packet (represented as "P2") as the packet P1.<br>
Then, the receiving side generates packet P3 by combining<br>
the previously received packet with the currently<br>
received packet.  Since the packet P3 corresponds to one<br>
transmitted with double the power of packet P1, the<br>
demodulation accuracy is improved.<br>
Also in an exemplary method illustrated in FIG. 4C,<br>
packet P1 is sent from the transmitting side to the<br>
receiving side.  If some error is detected at the<br>
receiving side, the receiving side keeps the packet P1<br>
without discarding it.  In response to the<br>
retransmission request, the transmitting side sends<br>
redundancy data derived by performing certain operations<br>
on the packet P1 as packet P2 .  For example, assume that<br>
3<br><br>
a sequence of packets such as "P1, P1', P1", ..." has been<br>
derived by encoding the packet P1. The derived sequence<br>
may differ depending on adopted coding algorithms. In<br>
the illustrated example, in response to receipt of a<br>
retransmission request, the transmitting side sends P1'<br>
as packet P2. The receiving side generates packet P3 by<br>
combining the previously received packet with the<br>
currently received packet. Since the packet P3 has<br>
increased redundancy, the demodulation accuracy will be<br>
improved. For example, assuming that the coding rate of<br>
the packet P1 is equal to "1/2", the coding rate of the<br>
packet P3 becomes equal to "1/4", thereby resulting in<br>
improved reliability. Note that the receiving side must<br>
already know some information as to what coding algorithm<br>
is adopted, what redundancy data are sent (also referred<br>
to as "puncture pattern"), and others.<br>
Fast packet scheduling scheme is a technique<br>
intended to improve frequency utilization efficiency in<br>
downlink. In a mobile communication environment, the<br>
channel state between a mobile station (user) and a base<br>
station varies over time as illustrated in FIG. 5. In<br>
this case, even though transmission of a large amount<br>
of data to a user with poor channel state is attempted,<br>
it is hard to improve the throughput. On the other hand,<br>
the higher throughput would be achieved for a user with<br>
a good channel state. From such a viewpoint, it is<br>
possible to improve the frequency utilization efficiency<br>
by determining whether the channel state is good for each<br>
user and assigning a shared data packet in favor of the<br>
user with the better channel state.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram for explaining the<br>
fast packet scheduling scheme. As illustrated, a shared<br>
data packet is assigned to a user with the better channel<br>
state (a user associated with greater SINR) in each time<br>
4<br><br>
slot.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to one implementation of the present<br>
invention, in a communication system where the frequency<br>
band of the downlink includes a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks including one or more carrier frequencies and one<br>
and more frequency blocks are used for data transmission<br>
to a single user, the quality of a received signal is<br>
evaluated for each frequency block, and the quality<br>
evaluations are compared.  Then, a predetermined number<br>
of quality evaluations of the received signal are sent<br>
over a control channel on the uplink.  Thus, since only<br>
the predetermined number of quality evaluations of the<br>
received signal less than the total number of frequency<br>
blocks are reported, it is possible to provide feedback<br>
on the channel state with a lesser amount of data<br>
transmission efficiently.<br>
The predetermined number of quality evaluations of<br>
a received signal may be obtained through selection of<br>
a predetermined number of top ones among a plurality of<br>
stored quality evaluations of the received signal. The<br>
predetermined number of quality evaluations of a received<br>
signal may be quality evaluations of a received signal<br>
for one or more frequency blocks reported over a control<br>
8<br><br>
channel on the downlink.<br>
One or more of the predetermined number of received<br>
signal quality evaluations may be represented as<br>
differences between a reference value and them.  Since<br>
the differences can be represented in a number of bits<br>
smaller than the reference value, it is possible to reduce<br>
the number of bits for use in the control channel.  The<br>
reference value may be an average of received signal<br>
quality evaluations throughout the frequency band in the<br>
downlink.  Also, only differences above a threshold may<br>
be provided as feedback.  Consequently, it is possible<br>
to reduce the number of received signal quality<br>
evaluations to be reported.<br>
Received signal quality evaluations transmitted<br>
over the uplink control channel may be sent in<br>
chronological order and in the form of the difference<br>
between a current evaluation and the previously<br>
transmitted evaluation.  Since the difference tends to<br>
be a smaller value, it is possible to further reduce the<br>
number of bits for use in the control channel.<br>
The transmission repetition of the predetermined<br>
number of received signal quality evaluations over the<br>
uplink control channel may be adjusted depending on<br>
Doppler frequency derived from the received signal, delay<br>
spreads and other amounts indicative of the communication<br>
state .<br>
[First Embodiment]<br>
In the following embodiment, the case where the OFDM<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme is<br>
adopted in the downlink is described. However, other<br>
schemes may be adopted. A broad frequency band in the<br>
downlink is divided into a plurality of frequency blocks.<br>
In general, although a single frequency block includes<br>
9<br><br>
one or more carrier frequencies, according to this<br>
embodiment, it is supposed that each frequency block<br>
includes a plurality of subcarriers.  Note that such a<br>
frequency block may be referred to as a "chunk".<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a receiving station 200 in a<br>
mobile communication system according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Although such a receiving<br>
station is typically provided in a mobile terminal, it<br>
may be provided in some apparatus other than mobile<br>
terminals. The receiving station 200 includes an RF<br>
receipt circuit 200-1, a subcarrier signal separation<br>
unit 200-2 coupled with the RF receipt circuit 200-1,<br>
a channel estimation unit 200-3 coupled with the<br>
subcarrier signal separation unit 200-2, one or more<br>
receiving channel state evaluation units 200-4 coupled<br>
with the subcarrier signal separation unit 200-2 and the<br>
channel estimation unit 200-3, a feedback data generation<br>
unit 200-5 coupled with the one or more receiving channel<br>
state evaluation units 200-4, an encoding and modulation<br>
unit 200-6 coupled with the feedback data generation unit<br>
200-5, an RF transmission circuit 200-7 coupled with the<br>
encoding and modulation unit 200-6, one or more<br>
demodulation units 200-8 coupled with the subcarrier<br>
signal separation unit 200-2, one or more decoding units<br>
200-9 coupled with the respective one or more<br>
demodulation units 200-8, a parallel to serial conversion<br>
unit 200-10 coupled with the one or more decoding units<br>
200-9, and an IP packet recovery unit 200-11 coupled with<br>
the parallel to serial conversion unit 200-10.<br>
In FIG. 6, a transmitted signal transmitted from<br>
a transmitting station (not illustrated) is received at<br>
the RF receipt circuit 200-1.  The RF receipt circuit<br>
200-1 supplies the received signal to the subcarrier<br>
signal separation unit 200-2.  The subcarrier signal<br>
10<br><br>
separation unit 200-2 divides the received signal into<br>
signals per subcarrier, and supplies the respective<br>
signals to the demodulation units 200-8, the receiving<br>
channel state evaluation unit 200-4 and the channel<br>
estimation unit 200-3.<br>
Each demodulation unit 200-8 demodulates the<br>
supplied signals per subcarrier, and supplies the<br>
demodulated signals to the respective decoding units<br>
200-9.  The number of decoders is variable depending on<br>
the decoding algorithm in use (the coding unit used in<br>
the algorithm).  Each decoding unit 200-9 decodes the<br>
supplied respective signal, and supplies the decoded<br>
signal to the parallel to serial conversion unit 200-10.<br>
The parallel to serial conversion unit 200-10<br>
parallel-to-serial converts the incoming signal, and<br>
supplies the resulting signal to the IP packet recovery<br>
unit 200-11.  The IP packet recovery unit 200-11 recovers<br>
the incoming signal.<br>
The channel estimation unit 200-3 uses a pilot<br>
symbol (pilot channel) for each subcarrier to perform<br>
channel estimation, and supplies such a channel<br>
estimation value to one or more receiving channel state<br>
evaluation units 200-4 for each subcarrier.<br>
Each receiving channel state evaluation unit 200-4<br>
evaluates the receiving channel state (ex. SIR) based<br>
on the channel estimation and the received signal for<br>
each subcarrier, and supplies the evaluation to the<br>
feedback data generation unit 200-5. The feedback data<br>
generation unit 200-5 generates feedback data (control<br>
information) indicative of the receiving channel state<br>
of the frequency block based on the evaluation of the<br>
incoming receiving channel state, and supplies it to the<br>
encoding and demodulation unit 200-6. The SIR included<br>
in the feedback data may be SIR per subcarrier just as<br>
11<br><br>
it is, or may be some converted value such as an average<br>
of SIRs throughout a predetermined number of subcarriers<br>
included in a frequency block.  The latter is why the SIR<br>
per frequency block is required in the transmitting side<br>
rather than the SIR per subcarrier.  The encoding and<br>
modulation unit 200-6 encodes and modulates the incoming<br>
feedback data, and supplies the resulting signal to the<br>
RF transmission circuit 200-7.  The RF transmission<br>
circuit 200-7 returns the feedback data as control<br>
information to the transmitting station 100.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a transmitting station 100 in<br>
a mobile communication system according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention.  The transmitting station 100<br>
is typically provided in a base station.  However, the<br>
transmitting station 100 may be provided in other<br>
apparatuses other than base stations.  The transmitting<br>
station 100 includes an RF receipt circuit 100-1, a<br>
demodulation and decoding unit 100-2 coupled with the<br>
RF receipt circuit 100-1, a scheduler 100-3 coupled with<br>
the demodulation and decoding unit 100-2, a header<br>
information acquisition unit 100-4, a packet selection<br>
unit 100-5 coupled with the header information<br>
acquisition unit 100-4, a buffer management unit 100-6<br>
coupled with the header information acquisition unit<br>
100-4, the packet selection unit 100-5 and the scheduler<br>
100-3, a PDU (Protocol Data Unit) generation unit 100-7<br>
coupled with the packet selection unit 100-5, a<br>
transmission buffer 10 0-8 coupled with the PDU generation<br>
unit 100-7 and the buffer management unit 100-6, a<br>
selector 10 0-9 coupled with the transmission buffer 100-8<br>
and the scheduler 100-3, one or more encoding and<br>
modulation units 100-10 coupled with the selector 100-9,<br>
and an RF transmission circuit 100-11 coupled with the<br>
encoding and modulation units 100-10.<br>
12<br><br>
As illustrated in the lower-right portion of FIG.<br>
7, a control signal including control information from<br>
each receiving station 200 (FIG. 6) is received at the<br>
RF receipt circuit 100-1, and the received control signal<br>
is supplied to the demodulation and decoding unit 100-2.<br>
In the demodulation and decoding unit 100-2, some<br>
demodulation and decoding operations are performed on<br>
the control signal, and upstream control information of<br>
each receiving station (including channel state in the<br>
downlink for each frequency block) is reported to the<br>
scheduler 100-3.<br>
On the other hand, as illustrated in the upper-left<br>
portion of FIG. 7, upon receipt of an IP packet from a<br>
network, the header information acquisition unit 100-4<br>
obtains packet header information such as a destination<br>
address from the received IP packet, reports the obtained<br>
packet header information to the buffer management unit<br>
100-6, and supplies the IP packet to the packet selection<br>
unit 100-5.<br>
The buffer management unit 100-6 specifies a<br>
storage location of the packet data to the packet<br>
selection unit 100-5 based on the reported packet header<br>
information and the state of each queue reported from<br>
the transmission buffer 100-8.  The buffer management<br>
unit 100-6 supplies the destination address and the<br>
memory address of a queue corresponding to the<br>
destination address to the transmission buffer 100-8.<br>
The buffer management unit 100-6 informs the scheduler<br>
100-3 of the packet header information and the state of<br>
each queue reported from the transmission buffer 100-8.<br>
The packet selection unit 100-5 selects the<br>
incoming IP packet based on the storage location for the<br>
packet data specified by the buffer management unit 100-6,<br>
and supplies selected packets individually to the PDU<br>
13<br><br>
generation unit 100-7. The PDU generation unit 100-7<br>
converts the incoming packets into PDUs, and supplies<br>
the resulting PDUs to the transmission buffer 100-8.<br>
The transmission buffer 100-8 configures a distinct<br>
queue for each destination address (each receiving<br>
station or each user) supplied from the incoming PDUs<br>
based on the destination address supplied from the buffer<br>
management unit 100-6 and the memory address of the<br>
corresponding queue, and informs the buffer management<br>
unit 100-6 of the state of each queue.<br>
The selector 100-9 extracts data from the queue<br>
specified by the scheduler 100-3, and supplies it to the<br>
encoding and modulation unit 100-10 associated with the<br>
specified frequency block.  This frequency block is<br>
assigned by the scheduler 100-3.  The scheduler 100-3<br>
determines to which user the frequency block should be<br>
assigned by priority based on the upstream control<br>
information (the channel state per frequency block in<br>
the downlink) reported from each receiving station, the<br>
packet header information and the state of each queue.<br>
The encoding and modulation unit 100-10 performs<br>
encoding and modulation on the data supplied from the<br>
selector 100-9. The encoded and modulated data are sent<br>
to each receiving station by the RF transmission circuit<br>
100-11.<br>
Based on the control information returned from the<br>
receiving station 200 as feedback, the scheduler 100-3<br>
generates a ranking table where each user is ranked in<br>
accordance with the associated priority. The priority<br>
is derived for each frequency block based on the quality<br>
of the receiving channel state of each user. Then,<br>
scheduling is performed for each frequency block. For<br>
example, as illustrated in FIG. 8, the downlink frequency<br>
band is divided into three frequency blocks 1, 2 and 3.<br>
14<br><br>
These three frequency blocks are included in any of radio<br>
frames (time slots) . For each frame and each frequency<br>
block, a user with the best receiving channel state is<br>
selected, and then for the selected user, the shared data<br>
packet in the downlink is assigned to the frequency block<br>
in the frame. In the illustrated example, for the second<br>
radio frame from the left, the frequency block 1 is<br>
assigned to the user #2, the frequency block 2 is assigned<br>
to the user #1, and the frequency block 3 is assigned<br>
to the user #4. For the immediately successive radio<br>
frame, the frequency blocks 1 and 2 are assigned to the<br>
user #2, and the frequency block 3 is assigned to the<br>
user #3.<br>
On the other hand, in the case where frequency is<br>
scheduled in favor of a user with a good receiving channel<br>
state, there is a likelihood that more frequency blocks<br>
are assigned to some users whereas less frequency blocks<br>
are assigned to the other users. In order to maintain<br>
fair assignment among users, the number of frequency<br>
blocks assigned to a single user within one radio frame<br>
may be limited to be less than or equal to a predetermined<br>
value K (K is a certain natural number) . In other words,<br>
a user to which K frequency blocks are assigned may be<br>
deleted from the ranking table for unassigned frequency<br>
blocks, and then the unassigned frequency blocks may be<br>
assigned to other users.<br>
The priority for the frequency blocks may be<br>
determined based on the illustratively listed criteria<br>
as presented below.<br>
(1)	Receiving channel state of each frequency block<br>
(2)	Ratio between time average of the receiving<br>
channel states in each frequency block and the receiving<br>
channel state for each frequency block in the radio frame<br>
(3)	Ratio between average the receiving channel<br>
15<br><br>
state over all subcarriers (included in the frequency<br>
block) and the receiving channel state of the target<br>
frequency block in the radio frame<br>
(4) Ratio between time average over averages of the<br>
receiving channel state over all subcarriers (included<br>
in the frequency block) and the receiving channel state<br>
of the target frequency block in the radio frame<br>
In case of the same priority based on the receiving<br>
channel state such as a reception SIR, the frequency block<br>
is assigned in favor of a user with a greater delay spread,<br>
and thereby the peak throughput is improved due to the<br>
frequency diversity effect.  Alternatively, in case of<br>
the same priority based on the receiving channel state<br>
such as a reception SIR, the frequency block may be<br>
assigned to a user with a smaller delay spread by priority.<br>
For a user with a greater delay spread, another frequency<br>
block can be assigned to the user because of a small<br>
difference of the average receiving channel states<br>
between frequency blocks such as difference between the<br>
average reception SIRs.<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
As described in the first embodiment, improved<br>
frequency utilization efficiency is achieved by dividing<br>
the downlink frequency band into a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks and assigning one or more frequency blocks to a<br>
user with a better channel state by priority. In this<br>
case, the receiving channel state of each frequency block<br>
must be known to perform frequency scheduling. The<br>
receiving channel state may be SIRmeasured at a receiving<br>
station (typically a mobile terminal), for example, and<br>
may be reported to a transmitting station (typically a<br>
base station) over an uplink control channel transmitted<br>
from the receiving station.  The transmitting station<br>
16<br><br>
must know the receiving channel state not only for each<br>
user but also for each frequency block. As a result, it<br>
is a concern that there is a significant increase in the<br>
information transmission amount in the control channel<br>
for preparing and scheduling a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks.<br>
In general, the information amount Rup (bit rate)<br>
required in an uplink control channel can be represented<br>
in the formula as follows;<br>
Rup= (Ks+AXNXKa) /T    (1) ,<br>
where Ks represents the number of users to which frequency<br>
blocks are actually assigned, A represents the number<br>
of bits required to represent SIR (in this embodiment,<br>
A=5) , N represents the total number of frequency blocks,<br>
Ka represents the number of users to which frequency<br>
blocks may be possibly assigned, and T represents the<br>
duration of a single packet, which may be referred to<br>
as TTI (Transmission Time Interval) . One bit is reserved<br>
to report the CRC result (ACK/NACK) of hybrid ARQ. In<br>
the above formula, the term "Ks/T" represents the<br>
information amount associated the CRC result from each<br>
user to which frequency blocks are actually assigned,<br>
and does not depend on the number N of frequency blocks.<br>
The term " (AXNXKA) /T" represents the information amount<br>
required to report SIR per frequency block to each user.<br>
For example, assuming that Ks=4, N=8, Ka=20 and<br>
T=0.5ms, it holds that Rup=1.61 Mbps.<br>
Alternatively, assuming that Ks=8, N=8, Ka=40 and<br>
T=0.5ms, it holds that Rup=3.22 Mbps.<br>
In this way, the greater the number of frequency<br>
blocks is, the significantly more is the information<br>
amount transmitted in the control channel.  The second<br>
embodiment of the present invention is intended to<br>
overcome the above-mentioned problem.  According to this<br>
17<br><br>
embodiment, in a communication system where the downlink<br>
frequency band is divided into a plurality of frequency<br>
blocks and one or more frequency blocks are used for a<br>
user with a better receiving channel state by priority,<br>
it is possible to provide a radio communication apparatus<br>
and method capable of efficiently reporting the channel<br>
state with less data transmission amount in the uplink<br>
control channel.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a feedback data generation unit<br>
for use in this embodiment.  This feedback data<br>
generation unit may be used as a feedback data generation<br>
unit 200-5 of FIG. 6.  The feedback data generation unit<br>
200-5 includes a receiving channel state comparison unit<br>
902, a reported content determination part 904 and a<br>
control signal generation unit 906.<br>
The receiving channel state comparison unit 902<br>
receives an amount indicative of received channel state,<br>
which is SIR in this embodiment, from the receiving<br>
channel state evaluation unit 200-4.  In case where the<br>
received SIR does not correspond to SIR per frequency<br>
block, an averaging operation or another suitable<br>
operation may be carried out.  For example, suppose that<br>
SIR is measured for each 1000 subcarriers and a single<br>
frequency block includes 100 subcarriers.  In this case,<br>
every 10 SIRs out of 100 SIRs obtained for each 100<br>
subcarriers are averaged so that 10 SIRs associated with<br>
10 frequency blocks can be derived.  The SIRs per<br>
subcarrier and/or frequency block are stored in an<br>
appropriate memory.  The receiving channel state<br>
comparison unit 902 compares the SIRs per frequency block<br>
with each other, and provides a comparison result.<br>
The reported content determination part 904 selects<br>
SIRs associated with a predetermined number of frequency<br>
blocks, and determines which SIR should be reported to<br>
18<br><br>
a base station.  Such a predetermined number of frequency<br>
blocks may be determined as follows.<br>
(1)	Among a plurality of SIRs stored in the memory,<br>
the top L SIRs indicative of better quality may be<br>
selected.  For example, suppose that if SIR as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 10 is obtained the top three SIRs<br>
(L=3) are selected.  In this case, the three SIRs<br>
associated with the frequency blocks "c", "e" and "f"<br>
are selected among the frequency blocks "a", "b", "c",<br>
"d", "e", "f" and "g".  It may be determined in advance<br>
how many of the top SIRs should be reported.  Also, the<br>
number may be changed depending on instruction from a<br>
base station.<br>
(2)	Among a plurality of SIRs stored in the memory,<br>
SIRs associated with X frequency blocks specified from<br>
a base station may be selected.  For example, SIR<br>
(receiving channel state) as illustrated in FIG. 10 is<br>
measured at a radio station, and assuming that downlink<br>
data toward the mobile station are transmitted in the<br>
frequency blocks "c" and "d".  In this case, the base<br>
station may instruct the mobile station to report the<br>
two SIR associated with the frequency blocks "c" and "d",<br>
or may instruct the mobile station to report SIRs<br>
associated with other frequency blocks in addition to<br>
or instead of those of the frequency blocks "c" and "d".<br>
For example, SIRs associated with frequency blocks<br>
selected for every two frequency blocks may be reported<br>
among a plurality of frequency blocks located on the<br>
frequency axis.  For example, if SIR as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 11 is measured, the three SIRs associated with the<br>
frequency blocks "a", "d" and "g" may be selected.<br>
(3)	Among a plurality of SIRs stored in the memory,<br>
one or more SIRs above a predefined threshold may be<br>
selected.  In other words, only SIRs associated with<br>
19<br><br>
frequency blocks with relatively better channel states<br>
may be reported to a base station among the stored SIRs.<br>
The control signal generation unit 906<br>
of FIG. 9 generates a control signal including<br>
identification information (ID) of a frequency block<br>
selected in the report content determination unit 904<br>
and SIR associated with the frequency block.  In other<br>
words, the control signal includes a predetermined number<br>
of combinations of the IDs of and SIRs associated with<br>
the frequency blocks.  Also, if any frequency block has<br>
been already assigned and downlink data have been<br>
received, the control signal also includes information<br>
indicative of an error detection result of that data.<br>
As stated above, the error detection result information<br>
may be represented in one bit to indicate affirmative<br>
acknowledge (ACK) or negative acknowledge (NACK).  The<br>
control signal generated in this manner is provided to<br>
the encoding and modulation unit 200-6, where some<br>
appropriate operation is subsequently performed, and the<br>
feedback is provided to the base station.<br>
According to this embodiment, the SIRs to be<br>
reported to a base station are selected based on certain<br>
criteria, resulting in a decrease in the number of SIRs<br>
(the number of frequency blocks) to be reported.  Thereby,<br>
it is possible to reduce the amount of information<br>
transmitted on the uplink control channel while<br>
maintaining information necessary to determine<br>
frequency blocks with better channel states for each<br>
user.<br>
[Third Embodiment]<br>
In the second embodiment, the number of SIRs (the<br>
number of frequency blocks) to be reported to a base<br>
station is reduced, but the number of bits to represent<br>
20<br><br>
SIRs may be reduced.  For example, the absolute value of<br>
a SIR associated with a certain frequency block may be<br>
represented in five bits, and SIRs associated with the<br>
other frequency blocks may be represented in form of<br>
differences (relative values) between the SIRs and the<br>
absolute value.  In general, since the difference can be<br>
represented in a number of bits smaller than five bits,<br>
the transmission amount can be reduced compared to the<br>
case of where all SIRs are represented in five bits.  The<br>
SIR represented as the absolute value may be associated<br>
with an arbitrary frequency block.  For example, the<br>
frequency block including the lowest carrier frequency<br>
or the frequency block including the highest carrier<br>
frequency may be represented in the form of the absolute<br>
value.  Alternatively, instead of SIR associated with a<br>
frequency block, a predefined different value may be<br>
prepared, and each SIR may be represented in the the form<br>
of the difference between the SIR and the predefined value.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 12, the average of SIRs over the<br>
entire band may be represented in the form of the absolute<br>
value, and the SIR associated with each frequency block<br>
may be represented in the form of the difference between<br>
the SIR and the average.<br>
Alternatively, SIR at a certain time point may be<br>
represented in the form of the absolute value, and<br>
subsequent SIRs may be represented as a temporal<br>
variations to the absolute value.  Further, SIR at the<br>
current time point may be represented as temporal<br>
variation to SIR at the immediately previous time point.<br>
In general, since the amount of short term variation is<br>
smaller than that of long term variation, SIR can be<br>
represented with a reduced transmission amount in this<br>
manner.  However, if an error is detected in a signal<br>
received at a mobile station, it is desirable to prevent<br>
21<br><br>
a chain of inaccurate values by reporting the absolute<br>
value and/or ignoring the temporal variation to the<br>
immediately previous SIR at the next time.<br>
According to this embodiment, SIR to be reported<br>
to a base station is represented as some value (relative<br>
value) such as the absolute value and/or difference.  The<br>
reduction in the number of bits required to report SIR<br>
makes it possible to reduce the information amount<br>
transmitted in the uplink control channel while<br>
maintaining information necessary to determine a<br>
frequency block with a better channel state for each user.<br>
[Fourth Embodiment]<br>
In the second and the third embodiments, the data<br>
transmission amount required to provide a single feedback<br>
is reduced.  On the other hand, the feedback may be<br>
infrequently provided.  For example, the frequency of<br>
the feedback may be adjusted based on mobility of a<br>
receiving station.  Since it is estimated that reception<br>
environment of a slow moving receiving station varies<br>
less, the frequency of feedback may be decreased.  The<br>
mobility can be evaluated, for example, based on the<br>
maximum Doppler frequency, and the maximum Doppler<br>
frequency is small in case of slow movement.  On the other<br>
hand, since it is estimated that the reception<br>
environment of a fast moving receiving station varies<br>
relatively more, the frequency of feedback may be<br>
increased.  In general, since a receiving station more<br>
frequently moves at slow speed than fast speed, it is<br>
estimated that frequent feedback does not have to be<br>
supplied.<br>
In addition, the content or the frequency of<br>
feedback may be adjusted depending on the delay spread<br>
in the downlink.  In general, the smaller the delay<br>
22<br><br>
spread is, the smaller is the channel variation in the<br>
frequency range.  Thus, since the difference of SIRs<br>
between frequency blocks is small for a user with an<br>
observed small delay spread, the channel state may be<br>
evaluated based on the single average of SIRs over the<br>
entire band.  Alternatively, the frequency of feedback<br>
may be decreased.<br>
In addition, only in the case where the level of<br>
SIR significantly varies compared to a previously<br>
reported SIR (only in the case where the variation amount<br>
exceeds a threshold) is the SIR sent to a base station.<br>
For example, if the temporal variation of SIR is small,<br>
such as in case of a stationary state, the reporting<br>
frequency of feedback can be reduced.<br>
According to this embodiment, the reduction in the<br>
reporting frequency of SIRs makes it possible to decrease<br>
the information amount transmitted in the uplink control<br>
channel while maintaining information necessary to<br>
determine frequency blocks with a better channel state<br>
for each user.<br>
The schemes described in the different embodiments<br>
may be employed by themselves or in any combination<br>
thereof.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an exemplary comparison of data<br>
transmission amounts for use in the different embodiments.<br>
As stated above, the required information amount Rup bit<br>
rate) in an uplink control channel according to the first<br>
embodiment can be represented as follows;<br>
Rup= (Ks+AXNXKa) /T     (1) ,<br>
where Ks represents the number of users to which frequency<br>
blocks are actually assigned, A represents the number<br>
of bits required to represent SIR (in this embodiment,<br>
A=5), N represents the total number of frequency blocks,<br>
Ka represents the number of users to which frequency<br>
23<br><br>
blocks may be assigned, and T represent the transmission<br>
time interval TTI.<br>
According to the second embodiment, SIRs associated<br>
with N' frequency blocks less than the total number N<br>
of frequency blocks are reported to a base station. Thus,<br>
the required information amount Rup in an uplink control<br>
channel can be represented as follows;<br>
Rup= (KS+AXN' XKa) /T   (2) .<br>
According to the third embodiment, SIRs are<br>
represented by an absolute value and values relative to<br>
the absolute value.  Thus, the required information<br>
amount Rup in an uplink control channel can be represented<br>
as follows;<br>
Rup=(Ks+(AXl + YX (N-l) ) XKa) /T    (3).<br>
In this formula, the term "AX1" represents the<br>
number of bits required to represent a single absolute<br>
value, and Y represents the number of bits required to<br>
represent a relative value (difference) from the absolute<br>
value. Among N frequency blocks, SIR associated with a<br>
single frequency block is represented in the form of the<br>
absolute value, and SIRs associated with the remaining<br>
(N-l) frequency blocks are represented in the form of<br>
relative values.<br>
In case where the second embodiment scheme is<br>
combined with the third embodiment scheme, SIRs are<br>
represented as the absolute value and relative values,<br>
and only SIRs associated with N' frequency blocks are<br>
reported to a base station.  Thus, the required<br>
information amount Rup in an uplink control channel can<br>
be represented as follows;<br>
Rup=(Ks+(AXl + YX (N'-l))XKa)/T   (4).<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates exemplary values of the<br>
information amount Rup computed in accordance with the<br>
formulae (l)-(4) in the case of the following parameter<br>
24<br><br>
setting:<br>
Ka (the number of users to which frequency blocks<br>
may be assigned) = 20 or 40;<br>
Ks (the number of users to which frequency blocks<br>
are actually assigned) = 4;<br>
N (the total number of frequency blocks) = 8;<br>
N' (the number of frequency blocks associated with<br>
SIRs to be reported to a base station) = 4;<br>
A (the number of bits used to represent the absolute<br>
value) = 5;<br>
Y (the number of bits used to represent differences<br>
to the absolute value) = 2; and<br>
T (transmission time interval TTI) = 0.5 ms.<br>
In this illustration, the values in the column "1st<br>
EMBODIMENT" are computed in accordance with the formula<br>
(1), the values in the column "2nd EMBODIMENT" are<br>
computed in accordance with the formula (2), the values<br>
in the column "3rd EMBODIMENT" are computed in accordance<br>
with the formula (3), and the values in the column "2nd<br>
+ 3rd EMBODIMENTS" are computed in accordance with the<br>
formula (4).  According to the present invention, it is<br>
possible to reduce the information amount significantly<br>
even in cases of 20 and 40 users.  Compared to the first<br>
embodiment, the information amount can be reduced to 51 %,<br>
48 % and 28 % according to the second embodiment, the<br>
third embodiment and the second and the third embodiments,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the above description, some preferred<br>

However, the present invention cannot be limited to the<br>
exact embodiments but variations and modifications can<br>
be made within the sprit of the present invention. For<br>

through some separate embodiments, but the separation<br>

between the embodiments is not essential to the present<br>
invention, and one or more embodiments may be used if<br>
