				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This application relates to a one-part polyurethane based adhesive useful in bonding porous and nonporous materials.  The adhesive is especially useful in bonding glass into window frames, for example, windshields into automobiles <br>
Polyurethane adhesive compositions typically comprise at least one urethane prepolymer.  Adhesives useful for bonding to nonporous substrates, such as glass to metal, are well-known.  When glass is installed in automobiles on a production line, a one-part moisture curable polyurethane adhesive is preferably used, as the equipment needed for the application of such an adhesive in an automobile assembly plant is less expensive than the equipment needed to apply a two-part adhesive.  One-part polyurethane adhesives are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,374,237 and 4,687,533.<br>
In the automotive after market replacement industry, glass is often bound into automobiles through the use of two-part moisture curable polyurethane adhesives.  Two-part polyurethane adhesives are used because they offer tapid initial cure allowing for rapid drive-away times.  Two-part adhesives require special applicators which mix the two parts in specific proportions immediately prior to application.  These applicators are more difficult and costly to use than applicators used fot one-part adhesives.  Further, the improper application or mixing of two-part adhesives can result in poor adhesion.  Two-part polyurethane adhesives are well-known, U.S. Patent 4,835,012 and DE 4,210,277.<br><br>
In addition, the market demands simpler application systems and faster curing adhesives which allow even faster drive-away times.  If the adhesive cures too rapidly, then the window installer loses the necessary time to install and properly place the glass into the frame before the adhesive becomes too intractable to work with.  Working time is defined as the period from application of adhesive until the adhesive becomes too intractable to work with.<br>
Future regulations in the U.S.   require dual airbags in vehicles.  During crashes the airbags inflate and exert additional pressure on the windshield.  Federal Transportation Agency regulations require that windshields remain in place at crashes of up to 3 0 mph (48 KPH).  This requires adhesives which have enhanced strength at the drive-away time.  To meet such a standard, the lap shear strengths of the adhesive should be preferably 150 psi (1033 kPa) or greater as determined according to ASTM D-3163 and demonstrate impact energy strength of 9 ft-lbs {12.2 Joules} or greater at the designated drive-away time.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a one-part polyurethane adhesive which facilitates faster drive-away time, which meets the strength and impact requirements defined above and which still provides for a reasonable working time to facilitate proper placement of glass in  ly window frames.  What is also needed is a one-part system which meets these requirements so that the disadvantages of the two-part systems can be avoided.<br>
In one embodiment the invention is a polyurethane prepolymer comprising the reaction product of<br><br>
A)	one or more polyisocyanate;<br>
B)	one or more compounds containing on average more than one isocyanate reactive compound; and<br>
C)	a dispersion triol containing from 10 to<br>
60 percent by weight based on the dispersion of particles of an organic polymer which is nonreactive with the isocyanate reactive compounds and the polyisocyanates having a particle size of from 5 to 50 microns;<br>
wherein the prepolymer has a free isocyanate content of from 0.8 to 2.2 percent.<br>
In another embodiment the invention is a one-part adhesive composition comprising:<br>
A)i) an isocyanate functional polyurethane<br>
prepolymer having a free isocyanate content of from 0.8 to 2.2 percent and particles comprising a curing agent for an isocyanate functional polyurethane prepolymer encapsulated within a coating material; or<br>
ii)  a prepolymer comprising the reaction<br>
product of one or more polyisocyanate.- one or more compounds containing on average more than one isocyanate reactive compound; and a dispersion triol containing from 10 to 60 percent by weight based on the dispersion of particles of an organic polymer which is nonreactive with the isocyanate reactive compounds and the polyisocyanates having a particle siz^ of<br><br>
from 5 to 50 microns; wherein the prepolymer has a free isocyanate content of from O.a to 2.2 percent; and<br>
B} a catalyst capable of catalyzing the reaction of isocyanate moieties with isocyanate reactive moieties.<br>
In yet another embodiment the invention is a process for binding two substrates together which comprises contacting an adhesive composition of the      y invention with at least one of the substrates and contacting the substrates together along the portion of the substrate{s) to which the adhesive has been applied before the adhesive applied cures and allowing the adhesive to cure and bond the substrates together.<br>
In another embodiment the invention is a process for bonding two substrates together which comprises rupturing the encapsulated curing agent particles so as to contact the curing agent with the prepolymer in the adhesive composition, contacting the adhesive composition of the invention with at least one of the substrates and contacting the substrates together along the portion of the substrate{s) to which the adhesive has been applied before the adhesive applied cures and allowing the adhesive to cure and bond the substrates together.<br>
The prepolymers of this invention facilitate the preparation of adhesives which solve the problems presented the skilled artisan.  The adhesives of this invention provides reasonable drive-away times for replacement glass it bonds into automobiles.  Such drive-away times are preferably 60 minutes and more preferably 30 minutes from application of the adhesive. The adhesive of the invention also provides reasonable<br><br>
working times, preferably 6 to 15 minutes, and more preferably 10 to 12 minutes.  Additionally, the lap shear strengths and the impact energy strengths of the adhesive at the drive away time are preferably 150 psi (1033 kPa) or greater and more preferably 250 psi (1723 kPa) or greater according to ASTM D-3163 and 9.0 ft-lbs (12.2 Joules) or greater, respectively.  Additionally, many of the problems associated with two-part adhesives described before are eliminated.<br>
The urethane prepolymers useful in the invention have an average isocyanate functionality sufficient to allow the preparation of a crosslinked polyurethane upon cure and not so high that the prepolymers are unstable-Stability in this context means that the prepolymer or adhesive prepared from the prepolymer has a shelf life of at least 6 months at ambient temperatures, in that it does not demonstrate an increase in viscosity during such period which prevents its application or use.  Preferably the prepolymer or adhesive prepared therefrom does not undergo an increase in viscosity of more than 50 percent during the stated period.  Preferably the average isocyanate functionality is at least 2.2 and preferably at least 2.4.  Below 2.2, the ability of the prepolymer to crosslink sufficiently to achieve the desired strength of the cured adhesive is compromised.  Preferably the average isocyanate functionality of the prepolymer is 3.0 or less and more preferably 2.8 or less.  Above 3.0 average isocyanate functionality the prepolymer and adhesives prepared from the prepolymer may exhibit unacceptable stability.  The prepolymer preferably has a free isocyanate content which facilitates acceptable strength in adhesives prepared from the prepolymers after 60 minutes and stability of the prepolymer.  Preferably the<br><br>
free isocyanate content is 0.8 percent by weight or greater based on the weight of the prepolymer, more preferably 1.0 percent by weight or greater, even more preferably 1.2 percent by weight or greater and most preferably 1.4 percent by weight or greater, and preferably 2.2 percent by weight or less, even more preferably 2.1 percent by weight or less and most preferably 1.8 percent by weight or less.  Above 2.2 percent by weight the adhesives prepared from the prepolymer may demonstrate lap shear strengths after 60 minutes which are too low for the intended use and foaming during cure of the adhesive prepared from the prepolymer may occur.  Below 0.8 percent by weight the prepolymer may exhibit instability, for instance by gelling within 3 days.  Preferably the weight average molecular weight of the prepolymer is 3,000 or greater, more preferably 4,000 or greater, even more preferably 5,000 or greater and most preferably 6,000 or greater; and is preferably 20,000 or less, more preferably 15,000 or less, even more preferably 10,000  or less and most preferably 8,000 or less.  The prepolymer preferably exhibits a viscosity which facilitates formulation of a pumpable adhesive which has good green strength. Preferably the viscosity of the prepolymer is 20,000 or less and more preferably 13,000 or less, preferably 3,000 centipoise or greater, and more preferably 5,000 centipoise or greater and most preferably 8,000 centipoise or greater.  The viscosity of the adhesive can be adjusted with fillers although the fillers cannot improve the green strength of the final adhesive.  Below 3,000 centipoise the adhesive prepared from the prepolymer may exhibit poor green strength.  Above 20,000 the prepolymer may be unstable and subject to gelling.  The prepolymer may be prepared by any suitable method, such as by reacting one<br><br>
or more compounds or polymers containing on average more than one, and preferably at least two, isocyanate-reactive groups with an excess over stoichiometry of a polyisocyanate under reaction conditions sufficient to form a prepolymer having isocyanate functionality and free isocyanate content which meets the criteria discussed above.<br>

{advantageously such combinations contain alpha-methylstyrene in amounts from 10 to 50, more advantageously from 15 to 40, weight percent of the total weight of the styrene and alpha-methylstyrene); with styrene being the most preferred monovinylidene aromatic c ompound.<br>

To prepare the copolymers based on styrene and optionally other unsaturated compounds, mass or a combination of mass/suspension polymerization techniques are most commonly employed.  Illustrative mass<br><br>
polymerization techniques are described in U.S. Patents 2,727,884 and 4,782,127,.  Processes for the preparation of block copolymers of monovinylidene aromatic comonomers and conjugated dienes are described in U.S. Patents 5,242,984 and U 5,134,968.<br>
In one embodiment the thermoplastic polymer particles may be rubber modified.  Generally this involves blending an elastomeric or rubbery polymer with the thermoplastic polymer.

Preferably the triol is a polyether triol, more preferably a polyoxyalkylene based triol and most Preferably the triol comprises a polyoxypropylene chain with a polyoxyethylene end cap.

Preferably such triol has molecular weight of 4,000 or greater, more preferably 5,000 or greater and most preferably 6,000 or greater.  Preferably such triol has a molecular weight of 8,000 or less and more preferably 7,000 or less.  Below 4,000 molecular weight the elongation and impact properties of the finally cured adhesive may be too low for the intended use.  Above 8,000 molecular weight the adhesive prepared from the prepolymer may be too elastomeric for the intended use.  The triol preferably has a hydroxyl number which is high enough such that the adhesive prepared from the prepolymer cures rapidly enough and provides the desired open times.  If the hydroxyl number is too low the adhesive cures too slowly and the desired open times and drive away times cannot be achieved.  The hydroxyl number should not be so<br><br>
high as to reduce the elongation of the cured adhesive prepared from the prepolymer.  Preferably the hydroxyl number of the triol is 15 or greater, more preferably 20 or greater, even more preferably 30 or greater and most preferably 40 or greater.  Preferably the hydroxyl number of the triol is 75 or less and more preferably 60 or less.<br>
The organic polymer particles dispersed in the triol preferably have a particle size which is large enough to improve the impact properties and elastomeric properties of the finally cured adhesive, but not so large so as to reduce the ultimate strength of the adhesive after 60 minutes of cure.  Preferably the particle size is 10 microns or greater and more preferably the particle size is 20 microns or greater.  Preferably the particle size is 50 microns or less and more preferably the particle size is 40 microns or less.  The triol dispersion contains a sufficient amount of organic polymer particles such that the adhesive, upon cure, has sufficient hardness for the desired use and not so much such that the cured adhesive has too much elasticity as defined by elongation. Preferably the dispersion contains 20 percent by weight or greater of organic polymer particles copolymer based on the dispersion, preferably 30 percent by weight or greater and more preferably 3 5 percent by weight or greater. Preferably the dispersion contains 60 percent by weight or less of organic polymer particles based on the dispersion, preferably 50 percent by weight or less and more preferably 45 percent by weight or less.<br>
If present, the dispersion of organic polymer particles in a triol is present in the prepolymer in an amount of 9 percent by weight or greater of the prepolymer and more preferably 10 percent by weight or greater, and<br><br>
18 percent by weight or less of the prepolymer and more preferably 12 percent by weight or less.<br>
In one embodiment the organic polymer particles comprise a polyurea, comprising the reaction product of a polyamine and a polyisocyanate.  The polyurea preferably does not react with isocyanate reactive moieties or isocyanate moieties.  Preferably the polyurea is prepared by the reaction of a polyamine, preferably a diamine, with a polyisocyanate, preferably a diisocyanate.  The polyurea and polyamine are mixed and undergo immediate reaction at room temperature.  Thereafter the polyurea is contacted with trioIs, preferably under high shear conditions to disperse the polyurea into the triol.  Preferably the isocyanate used to prepare the polyurea is a cycloaliphatic or aliphatic polyisocyanate, as the use of cycloaliphatic and aliphatic isocyanates facilitate handling and stability of the polyurea.  Preferably the polyurea has a urea functionality of 8 percent or greater, more preferably 10 percent or greater and most preferably 15 percent or greater.  Preferably the polyurea has a functionality of 40 percent or less and more preferably 20 percent or less.  Functionality as used herein relative to polyureas refers to weight percent of urea groups present in the polyurea.<br>
The polyurethane prepolymers of the invention may further comprise a plasticizer.  The plasticizers useful in the prepolymer are common plasticizers useful in polyurethane adhesive applications and well known to those skilled in the art.  The plasticizer is present in an amount sufficient to disperse the prepolymer in the final adhesive composition.  The plasticizer can be added to the adhesive either during preparation of the prepolymer or during compounding of the adhesive composition.<br><br>
Preferably the plasticizer is present in 1 percent by weight or greater of the prepolymer formulation (prepolymer plus plasticizer), more preferably 18 percent by weight or greater and most preferably 22 percent by weight or greater.  Preferably the plasticizer is present in an amount of 32 percent by weight or less of the prepolymer formulation and more preferably 25 percent by weight or less.<br>
The polyurethane prepolymer may be prepared by any suitable method, such as bulk polymerization and solution polymerization.  The reaction to prepare the prepolymer is carried out under anhydrous conditions, preferably under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen blanket, to prevent crosslinking of the isocyanate groups by atmospheric moisture.  The polyurethane prepolymer is preferably prepared by contacting the compound or polymers housing the isocyanate-reactive moieties in the absence of a catalyst and heating the mixture to 45°C or greater, more preferably 48°C or greater.  The mixture is heated to a temperature of 55"^C or less, more preferably 49°C or less.  The polyisocyanate is then added to the mixture and the mixture is subjected to mixing so as to evenly disperse the polyisocyanate in the reaction mixture.

The adhesive composition of this invention may further comprise plasticizers so as to modify the rheological properties to a desired consistency.  Such materials should be free of water, inert to isocyanate groups and compatible with a polymer.  Suitable plasticizers are well known in the art and preferable plasticizers include alkyl phthalates such as dioctylphthalate or dibutylphthalate, partially hydrogenated terpene commercially available as "HB-40", trioctyl phosphate, epoxy plasticizers, toluene-sulfamide,<br><br>

Other components commonly used in adhesive compositions may be used in the adhesive composition of this invention.  Such materials are well-known to those skilled in the art and may include ultraviolet stabilizers and antioxidants.<br>
As used herein, all parts by weight relative to the components of the adhesive composition are based on 100 total parts by weight of the adhesive composition.<br>
The adhesive composition of this invention may be formulated by blending the components together using means well-known in the art.  Generally the components are blended in a suitable mixer.  Such blending is preferably conducted in an inert atmosphere in the absence of oxygen and atmospheric moisture to prevent premature reaction. It may be advantageous to add any plasticizers to the reaction mixture for preparing the isocyanate containing prepolymer so that such mixture may be easily mixed and handled.  Alternatively, the plasticizers can be added<br><br>
during blending of all the components.  Once the adhesive composition is formulated, it is packaged in a suitable container such that it is protected from atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Contact with atmospheric moisture and oxygen could result in premature crosslinking of the polyurethane prepolymer-containing isocyanate groups.<br>
The encapsulated curing agent particles can be blended or mixed into the adhesive formulation using different processes at different stages of production. The encapsulated curing agent particles can be blended into the prepolymer after it has been synthesized.  This prepolymer, with the blended encapsulated curing agent particles, is then used for compounding into the adhesive. The encapsulated curing agent particles can also be blended into the adhesive directly after the compounding stage.  Once the mixing and wetting cycle of the fillers is complete within the mixing or blending apparatus, the encapsulated curing agent particles are added so as to achieve a good dispersion.  The encapsulated curing agent particles can be coextruded either dry or in a slurry with the prepolymer directly into the package during the filling and packaging stage.<br>
The adhesive composition of the invention is used to bond porous and nonporous substrates together. The adhesive composition is applied to a substrate and the adhesive on the first substrate is thereafter contacted with a second substrate.  In preferred embodiments, the surfaces to which the adhesive is applied are cleaned and primed prior to application, see for example U.S. Patents 4,525,511, 3,707,521 and 3,779,794.  Generally the adhesives of the invention are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result<br><br>
in curing of the adhesive.  Curing is accelerated by the addition of the encapsulated curing agent particles. Curing may be further accelerated by applying heat to the curing adhesive by means of convection heat, or microwave heating.  Preferably the adhesive of the invention is formulated to provide a working time of 6 minutes or greater more preferably 10 minutes or greater.  Preferably the working time is 15 minutes or less and more preferably 12 minutes or less.<br>
In the embodiment where the encapsulated curing agents are used, during the application of the adhesive of the invention, the particles are ruptured to release the curing agent so that it may accelerate the cure of the adhesive.  This rupturing of the particles may be performed by the application of heat, shear forces, ultrasonic waves or microwaves during application of the adhesive.  In many embodiments the dispensing apparatus has incorporated the necessary apparatus to rupture the particles.  The dispensing apparatus can incorporate a heating element, a means of shearing the particles, or applying ultrasonic or microwaves.  In a preferred embodiment the adhesive is forced through a screen which is at its smallest point smaller than the smallest particles.  In such embodiment it is preferable if the screen has long slits which have larger openings facing the adhesive to be extruded and smaller openings facing the dispensing nozzle wherein the smallest opening is smaller than the smallest particles and the larger opening is larger than the largest particle.  This design reduces the pressure drop which results from driving the adhesive containing the particles through the screen.<br>
The adhesive composition is preferably used to bond glass to other substrates such as metal or plastics.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the first substrate is a glass window and the second substrate is a window frame.  In another preferred embodiment the first substrate is a glass window and the second substrate is a window frame of an automobile.<br>
