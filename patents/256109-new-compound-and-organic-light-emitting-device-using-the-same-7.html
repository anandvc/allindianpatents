				<td>NEW COMPOUND AND ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE<br>
USING THE SAME (7)<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to an organic light emitting device in which a novel<br>
compound capable of significantly improving a lifespan, efficiency, and electrochemical<br>
and thermal stabilities of the organic light emitting device is contained in<br>
an organic compound layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
An organic light emission phenomenon is an example of a conversion of current<br>
into visible rays through an internal process of a specific organic molecule. The<br>
organic light emission phenomenon is based on the following mechanism. When<br>
organic material layers are interposed between an anode and a cathode, if voltage is<br>
applied between the two electrodes, electrons and holes are injected from the cathode<br>
and the anode into the organic material layer. The electrons and the holes which are<br>
injected into the organic material layer are recombined to form an exciton, and the<br>
exciton is reduced to a bottom state to emit light. An organic light emitting device<br>
which is based on the above mechanism typically comprises a cathode, an anode, and<br>
organic material layer(s), for example, organic material layers including a hole<br>
injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron transport<br>
layer, interposed therebetween.<br>
[4] The materials used in the organic light emitting device are mostly pure organic<br>
materials or complexes of organic material and metal. The material used in the organic<br>
light emitting device may be classified as a hole injection material, a hole transport<br>
material, a light emitting material, an electron transport material, or an electron<br>
injection material, according to its use. In connection with this, an organic material<br>
having a p-type property, which is easily oxidized and is electrochemically stable when<br>
it is oxidized, is mostly used as the hole injection material or the hole transport<br>
material. Meanwhile, an organic material having an n-type property, which is easily<br>
reduced and is electrochemically stable when it is reduced, is used as the electron<br>
injection material or the electron transport material. As the light emitting layer<br>
material, an organic material having both p-type and n-type properties is preferable,<br>
which is stable when it is oxidized and when it is reduced. Also a material having high<br>
light emission efficiency for conversion of the exciton into light when the exciton is<br>
formed is preferable.<br>
[5] In addition, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device<br>
further have the following properties.<br>
[6] First, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device have<br>
excellent thermal stability. The reason is that joule heat is generated by movement of<br>
electric charges in the organic light emitting device. NPB, which has recently been<br>
used as the hole transport layer material, has a glass transition temperature of 100Â°C or<br>
lower, thus it is difficult to apply to an organic light emitting device requiring a high<br>
current.<br>
[7] Second, in order to produce an organic light emitting device that is capable of being<br>
actuated at low voltage and has high efficiency, holes and electrons which are injected<br>
into the organic light emitting device must be smoothly transported to a light emitting<br>
layer, and must not be released out of the light emitting layer. To achieve this, a<br>
material used in the organic light emitting device must have a proper band gap and a<br>
proper HOMO or LUMO energy levels. A LUMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS, which<br>
is currently used as a hole transport material of an organic light emitting device<br>
produced using a solution coating method, is lower than that of an organic material<br>
used as a light emitting layer material, thus it is difficult to produce an organic light<br>
emitting device having high efficiency and a long lifespan.<br>
[8] Moreover, the material used in the organic light emitting device must have excellent<br>
chemical stability, electric charge mobility, and interfacial characteristic with an<br>
electrode or an adjacent layer. That is to say, the material used in the organic light<br>
emitting device must be little deformed by moisture or oxygen. Furthermore, proper<br>
hole or electron mobility must be assured so as to balance densities of the holes and of<br>
the electrons in the light emitting layer of the organic light emitting device to<br>
maximize the formation of excitons. Additionally, it has to be able to have a good<br>
interface with an electrode including metal or metal oxides so as to assure stability of<br>
the device.<br>
[9] Accordingly, there is a need to develop an organic light emitting device including<br>
an organic material having the above-mentioned requirements in the art<br>
[10]<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11] Therefore, the object of the present inventions is to provide an organic light<br>
emitting device which is capable of satisfying conditions required of a material usable<br>
for an organic light emitting device, for example, a proper energy level, electrochemical<br>
stability, and thermal stability, and which includes a fluorene derivative<br>
having a chemical structure capable of playing various roles required in the organic<br>
light emitting device, depending on a substituent group.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention provides an organic light emitting device which comprises a<br>

[22] A detailed description will be given of the substituent groups of Formula 1.<br>

[25] The carbon number of the alkyl, alkoxy, and alkenyl groups of Rl to R13 of<br>
Formula 1 is not limited, but is preferably 1 - 20.<br>
[26] The length of the alkyl group contained in the compound does not affect the<br>
conjugate length of the compound, but may affect the method of applying the<br>
compound to the organic light emitting device, for example, a vacuum deposition<br>
method or a solution coating method.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of the present invention.<br>
Various substituent groups are introduced into a core structure shown in Formula 1,<br>
in detail, the core structure in which a fluorene group is bonded to a combination of an<br>
acridine group and a carbazolyl group to form a spiro structure, thereby the compound<br>
of Formula 1 has characteristics suitable for application to an organic material layer<br>
used in an organic light emitting device. This will be described in detail, below.<br>
The steric core structure of the compound of Formula 1 can be divided into two<br>
portions, A and B, for explanation as shown in the following figure.<br>
 [63] The compound of Formula 1 has the steric core structure in which a plane A meets<br>
with a plane B at right angles around X, and conjugation does not occur between the A<br>
and B portions around X. Furthermore, since one nitrogen atom is positioned among<br>
three aryl groups in the plane B, conjugation is limited in the plane B.<br>
[64] The conjugation length of the compound has a close relationship with an energy<br>
band gap. In detail, the energy band gap is reduced as the conjugation length of the<br>
compound increases. As described above, since a conjugation structure is limited in the<br>
core structure of the compound of Formula 1, the core structure has a large energy<br>
band gap.<br>
[65] As described above, in the present invention, various substituent groups are<br>
introduced to Rl to R13 positions and Zl to Z2 positions of the core structure having<br>
the large energy band gap so as to produce compounds having various energy band<br>
gaps. Generally, it is easy to control the energy band gap by introducing substituent<br>
groups into a core structure having a large energy band gap, but it is difficult to significantly<br>
control the energy band gap by introducing substituent groups into a core<br>
structure having a small energy band gap. Furthermore, in the present invention, it is<br>
possible to control HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the compound by introducing<br>
various substituent groups into Rl to R13 and Zl to Z2 of the core structure.<br>
[66] Additionally, various substituent groups are introduced into the core structure to<br>
produce compounds having intrinsic characteristics of the substituent groups. For<br>
example, substituent groups, which are frequently applied to hole injection layer, hole<br>
transport layer, light emitting layer, and electron transport layer materials during the<br>
production of the organic light emitting device, are introduced into the core structure<br>
so as to produce substances capable of satisfying the requirements of each organic<br>
material layer. Particularly, since the core structure of the compound of Formula<br>
includes the arylamine structure, it has an energy level suitable for the hole injection<br>
and/or hole transport materials in the organic light emitting device. In the present<br>
19<br>
invention, the compound having the proper energy level is selected depending on the<br>
substituent group among the compounds represented by Formula 1 to be used in the<br>
organic light emitting device, thereby it is possible to realize a device having a low<br>
actuating voltage and a high light efficiency.<br>
[67] Furthermore, various substituent groups are asymmetrically introduced into the core<br>
structure (the A portion is located at one side of the core structure) so as to precisely<br>
control the energy band gap, improve interfacial characteristics with organic materials,<br>
and apply the compound to various fields.<br>
[68] In addition, if the number of nitrogen contained in the substituent group A is set to 1<br>
(if Zl and Z2 are hetero aromatic amine compounds, the number of nitrogen contained<br>
in them is not counted), it is possible to precisely control the HOMO and LUMO<br>
energy levels and the energy band gap, and on the other hand interfacial characteristics<br>
with the organic materials is improved and thereby make it possible to apply the<br>
compound to various fields.<br>
[69] Additionally, various substituent groups are introduced into the steric structure of<br>
the compound of Formula 1 using spiro bonding to control the three-dimensional<br>
structure of the organic material so as to minimize n-n interaction in the organic<br>
material, thereby formation of excimers is prevented.<br>
[70] Meanwhile, since the compound of Formula 1 has a high glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg), it has excellent thermal stability. For example, the glass transition<br>
temperature of the compound of Formula 3-2 is 143Â°C, which is still higher than that of<br>
conventionally used NPB (Tg: 96Â°C). Such increase in thermal stability is an important<br>
factor providing actuating stability to the device.<br>
[71] Furthermore, the compound of Formula 1 may be used to form the organic material<br>
layer using a vacuum deposition process or a solution coating process during the<br>
production of the organic light emitting device. In connection with this, illustrative, but<br>
non-limiting, examples of the solution coating process include a spin coating process, a<br>
dip coating process, an inkjet printing process, a screen printing process, a spray<br>
process, and a roll coating process.<br>
[72] For example, the compound of Formula 1 has excellent solubility to a polar solvent,<br>
such as xylene, dichloroethane, or NMP, which is used during the production of the<br>
device, and forms a thin film very well through the process using a solution, thus the<br>
solution coating process may be applied to produce the device.<br>
[73] Tertiary alcohol, which is produced by a reaction of a lithiated aryl and keto group,<br>
is heated in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hexagonal cyclic structure while<br>
water is removed, thereby producing the compound having a spiro structure according<br>
to the present invention. The above-mentioned procedure for producing the compound<br>
is well known in the art, and those skilled in the art can change the production<br>
20<br>
conditions during the production of the compound of Formula 1. The production will<br>
be described in detail in the preparation examples later.<br>
[74] In the organic light emitting device of the present invention, a compound, in which<br>
a thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group is introduced into the<br>
compound of Formula 1, may be used instead of the compound of Formula 1. The<br>
former compound has the basic physical properties of the compound of Formula 1, and<br>
may be used to form a thin film using a solution coating process and then be cured so<br>
as to form an organic material layer during the production of the device.<br>
[75] The method of forming the organic material layer, which comprises introducing the<br>
curable functional group into the organic material during the production of the organic<br>
light emitting device, forming the organic thin film using the solution coating process,<br>
and curing the resulting film, is disclosed in US Pat. No. 2003-0044518 and EP Pat.<br>
No. 1146574 A2.<br>
[76] The above documents state that, if the organic material layer is formed through the<br>
above-mentioned method using a material having a thermosetting or photocrosslinkable<br>
vinyl or acryl group so as to produce an organic light emitting device, it<br>
is possible to produce an organic light emitting device having a low voltage and high<br>
brightness as well as an organic light emitting device having a multilayered structure<br>
using the solution coating process. This operation mechanism may be applied to the<br>
compound of the present invention.<br>
[77] In the present invention, the thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group<br>
may be a vinyl or an acryl group.<br>
[78] The organic light emitting device of the present invention can be produced using<br>
known materials through a known process, modified only in that at least one layer of<br>
organic material layer(s) include the compound of the present invention, the compound<br>
of Formula 1.<br>
[79] The organic material layer(s) of the organic light emitting device according to the<br>
present invention may have a single layer structure, or alternatively, a multilayered<br>
structure in which two or more organic material layers are layered. For example, the<br>
organic light emitting device of the present invention may comprise a hole injection<br>
layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an<br>
electron injection layer as the organic material layers. However, the structure of the<br>
organic light emitting device is not limited to this, but may comprise a smaller number<br>
of organic material layers.<br>
[80] Furthermore, the organic light emitting device of the present invention may be<br>
produced, for example, by sequentially layering a first electrode, organic material<br>
layer(s), and a second electrode on a substrate. In connection with this, a physical<br>
vapor deposition (PVD) method, such as a sputtering method or an e-beam evaporation<br>
21<br>
method, may be used, but the method is not limited to these.<br>
[81] A method of producing the compound of Formula 1 and the production of the<br>
organic light emitting device using the same will be described in detail in the following<br>
preparation examples and examples. However, the following preparation examples and<br>
examples are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed to limit the present<br>
invention.<br>
[82]<br>
Mode for the Invention<br>
[83] A better understanding of a method of producing an organic compound represented<br>
by Formula 1 and the production of an organic light emitting device using the same<br>
may be obtained in light of the following preparation examples and examples which<br>

 [105] EXAMPLE 3: Production of an organic light emitting device<br>
 [107] A glass substrate (corning 7059 glass), on which ITO (indium tin oxide) was<br>
applied to a thickness of 1000 A to form a thin film, was put in distilled water, in<br>
which a detergent was dissolved, and washed using ultrasonic waves. In connection<br>
with this, a product manufactured by Fischer Inc. was used as a detergent, and distilled<br>
water was produced by filtering twice using a filter manufactured by Millipore Inc.<br>
After ITO was washed for 30 min, ultrasonic washing was conducted twice using<br>
distilled water for 10 min. After the washing using distilled water was completed,<br>
ultrasonic washing was conducted using isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and methanol<br>
solvents, and drying was then conducted. Next, it was transported to a plasma washing<br>
machine. Furthermore, the substrate was dry washed using oxygen plasma for 5 min,<br>
and then transported to a vacuum evaporator.<br>
[108] Hexanitrile hexaazatriphenylene (hereinafter, referred to as "HAT") of the<br>
following Formula was vacuum deposited to a thickness of 500 A by heating on a<br>
transparent ITO electrode, which was prepared through the above procedure, so as to<br>
form an anode including an ITO conductive layer and an N-type organic material.<br>
The compound of Formula 3-2 (400 A) was vacuum deposited thereon to form a<br>
hole transport layer. Alq3 was vacuum deposited to a thickness of 300 A on the hole<br>
transport layer to form a light emitting layer. An electron transport layer material of the<br>
following Formula was deposited to a thickness of 200 A on the light emitting layer to<br>
form an electron transport layer.<br>
Electron transport layer<br>
mater ial<br>
Lithium fluoride (LiF) having a thickness of 12 A and aluminum having a thickness<br>
of 2000 A were sequentially deposited on the electron transport layer to form a<br>
cathode.<br>
In the above procedure, the deposition speed of an organic material was maintained<br>
at 0.3 - 0.8 A/sec. Furthermore, lithium fluoride and aluminum were deposited at<br>
speeds of 0.3 A/sec and 1.5 - 2.5 A/sec, respectively, on the cathode. During the<br>
deposition, a vacuum was maintained at 1 ~ 3 X 10-7.<br>
 [114] The resulting device had an electric field of 4.53 V at a forward current density of<br>
100 mA/cm2, and a spectrum having a light efficiency of 1.91 Im/W. The operation and<br>
light emission of the device at the above-mentioned actuating voltage mean that the<br>
compound of Formula 3-2, which formed the layer between the hole injection layer<br>
and the light emitting layer, functions to transport holes.<br>
 [116] EXAMPLE 4: Production of an organic light emitting device<br>
 [118] The procedure of example 14 was repeated to produce a device except that the<br>
compound of Formula 3-8 was applied to the hole transport layer of example 3, instead<br>
of the compound of Formula 3-2.<br>
[119] The resulting device had an electric field of 4.33 V at a forward current density of<br>
ry _<br>
100 mA/cm , and a spectrum having a light efficiency of 1.93 Im/W. The operation and<br>
light emission of the device at the above-mentioned actuating voltage mean that the<br>
compound of Formula 3-8, which formed the layer between the hole injection layer<br>
and the light emitting layer, functions to transport holes.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[121] The compound of the present invention can be used as an organic material layer<br>
material, particularly, hole injection and/or transport materials in an organic light<br>
emitting device, and when applied to an organic light emitting device it is possible to<br>
reduce the actuating voltage of the device, to improve the light efficiency thereof, and<br>
to improve the lifespan of the device through the thermal stability of the compound.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
