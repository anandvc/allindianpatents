				<td>METHOD FOR MELTING ASBESTOS WASTE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of melting asbestos waste generated by disposing of architectural material such as asbestos slate and spray asbestos, for example.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Asbestos is fabriform mineral and excellent in fire resistance and heat resistance and, therefore, is widely used as architectural material and the like such as asbestos slate and spray asbestos . However, it has been pointed out to cause a mesothelioma and an asbestos lung when the above described asbestos enters the body from a respiratory system in a fine fabriform state.<br>
Therefore, on the occasion of disposing of architectural material and the like containing asbestos such as the above described asbestos slate and spray asbestos, asbestos waste of the architectural material and the like is packaged in double layers with water-resistant material such as plastic material and then used up as a landfill.  However, there are such problems that it has become difficult to secure land for disposal fields in recent years and, moreover, the above described landfilling disposition retains the fabriform mode of asbestos without no change and is not rendered harmless.<br>
In order to solve the above described problems, it has been proposed that the above described asbestos waste undergoes amelting treatment (see Japanese Patent Laid-OpenNo. 9-19672, for example). The above described asbestos includes chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite and the like, and their melting points are respectively 1521°C for chrysotile, 1399°C for amosite, and 1193°C for crocidolite.  Accordingly, on the occasion of melting the above described asbestos waste, in general, a fusing agent such as glass cullet is added to asbestos waste and thereby the melting point is caused to drop.<br>
However, at the time of adding the above described fusing agent to the above described asbestos waste, the above described double package must be unpackaged, giving rise to inconvenience that people in charge of working might aspirate fine fibers of asbestos.  In addition, the above described melting treatment presents such inconvenience that fuel is required to melt the above described asbestos waste and, moreover, the treatment costs increase.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method capable of eliminating such an inconvenience and melting asbestos waste safely and inexpensively.<br>
.SUMMARY OF THF, INVENTION<br>
In order to attain such an object, a method for melting asbestos waste of the present invention comprises a process of supplying scalable mixing means with asbestos waste in a packaged state and fournL ashes of waste, a process of tearing<br>
to open the package of the asbestos waste inside the sealed mixing means to expose the asbestos to mix the asbestos waste and the burnt ashes, a process of housing the mixed asbestos waste and burnt ashes in a rotary kiln and a process of burning a part of waste inside a gasification furnace while causing the remnants of the waste to undergo dry distillation to generate flammable gas, introducing the flammable gas to a burner furnace to burn and introducing at least a part of exhaust gas of the burner furnace to the rotary kiln, and heating the mixture of the asbestos waste and the burnt ashes to melt the asbestos waste.<br>
The method of the present invention provides the above described mixing means with the above described asbestos waste in a packaged state and burnt ashes of the above described waste. The above described mixing means is sealable, tears and opens the package of the above described asbestos waste in a sealed state, exposes the asbestos, andmixes the asbestos waste with the burnt ashes.<br>
This will only require to supply the above describedmixing means with the above described asbestos waste in the packaged state so as to deprive necessity of unpackaging. In addition, the above described mixing means can be sealed and therefore can prevent the exposed asbestos waste from being scattered in the air . Therefore, according to the method of the present invention, the asbestos waste can be treated safely.<br>
In the method of the present invention, next, by housing a mixture of the asbestos waste and the burnt ashes obtained<br>
in the above described mixing means in a rotary kiln and heating<br>
the mixture inside the rotary kiln, the asbestos waste is melted.<br>
At that time, the above described burnt ashes contain<br>
components selected from the group consisting of Si02, CaO,<br>
AI2O3, chlorides and the like and, therefore, act as a fusing<br>
agent to drop the melting point of the above described asbestos<br>
waste. Consequently, the above described asbestos waste<br>
decreases in melting point and is easily melted by heating<br>
inside the rotary kiln.<br>
In addition, in the method of the present invention, the<br>
above described rotary kiln is heated by burning a part of<br>
waste inside a gasification furnace to cause remnants of the waste to undergo dry distillation to generate<br>
flammable gas, introducing the flammable gas to a burner furnace to burn and introducing at least a part of the exhaust gas of the flammable gas to the rotary kiln. Here, the burnt ashes obtained inside the above described gasification furnace are usable for mixing the above described asbestos waste.<br>
Therefore, according to the method of the present invention, there is no need to use a fusing agent or fuel for melting the above described asbestos waste but it is possible to carry out the melting treatment of the asbestos waste inexpensively.<br>
In the method of the present invention, it is possible to use the above described asbestos waste which is doubly packaged with water-resistant material such as plastic material, for example.In addition, in the method of the present invention, it is preferable for the above described mixing means to tear and open the package of asbestos waste to expose the asbestos by sandwiching the above described asbestos waste in a packaged state with two screw conveyers provided mutually in parallel and turning the screw conveyers in the mutually opposite directions.<br>
In addition, in the method of the present invention, the above described waste is preferably at least one kind of waste selected from the group consisting of refuse paper, refuse wood and refuse plastic since its burnt ashes contain Si02, CaO, A120;3, chlorides and the like.<br>

In its upper portion, connected to the aspirating and introducing means 7 aspirating the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 and introducing it to the burner furnace 2. In addition, the rotary furnace 31 is provided with a pressure sensor 34 detecting the interior pressure P2 so that the pressure sensor 34 outputs the detecting signal to the aspirating and introducing means 7.In addition, the slot 32 is sealably configured by, for example, double covers not shown in the drawing, comprising a motor 32b controlled in accordance with the exit temperature T2 detected by a temperature sensor 32a provided in the vicinity of the exit of the rotary furnace 31 and a screw conveyer 32c driven by the motor 32b. Two screw conveyers 32c are provided in parallel (only one of them is shown in FIG. 1) so as to hold the above described packaged asbestos waste by sandwiching it between both of screw conveyers 32c and 32c. Both screw conveyers 32c and 32c rotate in the mutually opposite direction, thereby tear and open the package of asbestos waste sandwiched and held between the both screw conveyers to expose the asbestos waste, crushing the exposed asbestos waste and mixes it with the burnt ashes of the waste A.

tower 39 provided midway in the duct 38, a chemisorption<br>
apparatus 40, a bug filter 41, a fan 42 and a chimney 43 provided<br>
at the end of the duct 38. In the case where exhaust gas of<br>
flammable gas discharged from the burner furnace 2 contains<br>
matter causing environmental pollution when directly discharged in the air, such as malodorous components and the like,<br>
the chemisorption apparatus 40 converts the matter into chemically stable matter and removes it from the exhaust gas. In the present embodiment, the chemisorption apparatus 40 is designed to remove hydrogen chloride gas in the above described exhaust gas as calcium chloride after reaction with calcium hydroxide. In addition, the fan 42 is designed to aspirate the exhaust gas of the flammable gas and the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 from the burner furnace 2 so that the inner pressure P1 of the burner furnace 2 is always maintained at substantially constant pressure in accordance with the detecting signal inputted from the pressure sensor 8.<br>
Next, operations of the dry-distilling gasification burning treatment apparatus shown in FIG. 1 will be described.<br>
On the occasion of burning the waste A, at first the slot door 10 of one of the gasification furnaces 1 is opened and the waste A is taken in inside the gasification furnace 1 from the slot 11. Subsequently, after the slot door 10 is closed,the ignition apparatus 16 is activated for a predetermined time and thereby the waste A inside the gasification furnace 1 is ignited so that the waste A starts to burn partially. When the waste A starts to burn partially, the lower layer of the waste A goes on burning gradually and the burning heat thereof starts to undergo the dry distillation in the upper layer of the waste A and the dry distillation starts to generate flammable gas. The above described flammable gas is introduced from inside the gasification furnace 1 to the burner furnace 2 through the gas passage 19. In the burner furnace 2, the ignition apparatus 20 is activated for a predetermined time, thereby the above described introduced flammable gas is ignited and thereby the flammable gas starts to burn naturally.<br>
The burning temperature TI of the above described flammable gas is detected by the temperature sensor 3. The detected signal is outputted to the on-off valve 28 of the oxygen supplying means 4 and the on-off valve 30 of the oxygen supplying means 5. At that time, the on-off valve 28 of the oxygen supplying means 4 automatically adjusts the opening level thereof to control the above described flammable gas yield in accordance with the detecting signal inputted from the temperature sensor 3, so as to substantially maintain the burning temperature TI of the above described flammable gas at a setting temperate determined in advance as burning temperature at which the flammable gas can burn naturally.<br>
Specifically, when the burning temperature TI gets lower than the above described setting temperature, the automatic adjustment of the opening level of the on-of f valve 28 increases the opening level of the on-off valve 28, increases the oxygen-vent airflow to the gasification furnace 1, promotes the lower layer of the waste A to burn and increases generation of the above described flammable gas. On the contrary, when the burning temperature TI gets higher than the above described setting temperature, the opening level of the on-off valve 28 is made small to decrease the oxygen-vent airflow to the gasification furnace 1, the lower layer of the waste A is restrained to burn less and generation of the above described flammable gas is reduced.<br>
In addition, the on-off valve 30 of oxygen supplying means 5 automatically adjusts the opening level thereof so as to supply the burner furnace 2 with oxygen required for completely burning the introduced flammable gas in accordance with the above described detecting signal inputted from the temperature sensor 3.  Specifically, the automatic adjustment of the opening level of the on-off valve 30 increases the opening level to increase the oxygen-vent airflow to the burner furnace 2 in an initial stage of the dry distillation of the waste A as the amount of flammable gas introduced to the burner furnace 2 increases and the burning temperature TI thereof increases. In addition, in the stage where dry distillation of the waste A progresses stably, the opening level is increased or decreased as the burning temperature TI of the flammable gas<br>
increases and decreases slightly and the oxygen-vent airflow to the burner furnace 2 is adjusted and thereby oxygen in such an amount that can completely burn the flammable gas introduced to the burner furnace 2 is mixed with the flammable gas.<br>
As described above, when dry distillation gasification of the waste A gets to progress stably inside the gasification furnace I, and then in accordance therewith, combustion of the flammable gas introduced from the gasification furnace 1 to the burner furnace 2 gets to progress stably as well so that the part of the exhaust gas of the flammable gas is introduced from the exhaust extracting port 23 to the rotary kiln 6.<br>
In the rotary kiln 6, at first, asbestos waste in a state doubly packaged with water-resistant material such as plastic material, for example, and burnt ashes of the waste A are taken in to the slot 32. The two screw conveyers 32c and 32c hold to sandwich the above described taken-in asbestos waste in a packaged state. Therefore, the screw conveyers 32c and 32c are rotary-driven in the mutually opposite directions and thereby the packaging of the above described asbestos waste is torn and opened by the edge of the screw of the screw conveyers 32c and 32c to expose the asbestos waste. At that time, the slot 32 is sealed with the double covers and the like as described above so that the exposed asbestos waste can be prevented from being scattered in the air.<br>
Moreover, the above described asbestos waste is crushed with the screw conveyers 32c and 32c inside the slot 32 sealed<br>
as described above and is mixed with splinters of water-resistant material such as the above described plastic material and the burnt ashes of the waste A to form the mixture B. The mixture B is conveyed to the end portion to the slot 32 with the screw conveyers 32c and 32c and is taken in from the end portion into the rotary furnace 31.<br>
The mixture B taken in into the rotary furnace 31 as described above is taken in from upward the rotary furnace 31 gradually inclined along the longitudinal direction as described above and moves gradually in the direction of the lower exhaust extracting port 33 as the rotary furnace 31 rotates. Here, when the exhaust gas of the above described flammable gas is introduced from the lower portion of the rotary furnace 31, the mixture B which is moving from the upper portion of the rotary furnace 31 to the lower portion of the extracting port 33 located downward is heated.<br>
When the mixture B is heated, the burnt ashes of the waste A acts as a fusing agent of the above described asbestos waste and therefore the asbestos waste in the mixture B drops the melting point, is melted easily by the above described heating and is rendered harmless. Here, splinters of the above described water-resistant material are included in the mixture B. The splinters are heated inside the rotary furnace 31 to burn and the burnt ashes thereof together with the burnt ashes of the waste A act as a fusing agent of the above described asbestos waste.<br>
And the melted asbestos waste is extracted from the extracting port 33 provided downward in the rotary furnace 31. At that time, the above described asbestos waste is melted and rendered harmless as described above and therefore can be treated safely.<br>
In the rotary furnace 31, the exhaust gas of the above described flammable gas cooled by heating the mixture B and gas generated by heating the mixture B are aspirated to the fan 37 as exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 and are introduced from the exhaust intake 24 into inside the burner furnace 2. At that time, the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 has possibilities of including fine pieces of the above described asbestos waste, but is trapped by the cyclone dust collector 36 provided midway in the duct 35 and therefore the asbestos waste can be prevented from being scattered in the air. And the exhaust gas of the above described flammable gas and the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 are aspirated to the fan 42 through the duct 38 and discharged from the chimney 43 to the air.<br>
The exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 is introduced to inside the burner furnace 2 and then the influence of the exhaust and the influence of the flammable gas introduced from the gasification furnace I gets unbalanced and the above described flammable gas inside the burner furnace 2 occasionally burns unstably. The fan 42 is designed to aspirate the exhaust of the above described flammable gas inside the burner furnace 2 and the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 so as to always maintain the inner pressure PI in the burner furnace 2 at substantially<br>
constant pressure in accordance with a detecting signal inputted from a pressure sensor 8 so that the above described flammable gas burns stably.<br>
In addition, the fan 37 aspirates the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 so as to always make the inner pressure P2 inside the rotary kiln 6 lower than the inner pressure PI of the above described burner furnace 2 in accordance with a detecting signal inputted from pressure sensors 8 and 34 and thereby controls the pressure of the exhaust introduced from the fan 37 to the burner furnace 2 to get higher than the inner pressure PI of the above described burner furnace 2 . Thus, the exhaust gas of the above described flammable gas is aspirated from the burner furnace 2 to the rotary kiln 6 smoothly and the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 is introduced to the burner furnace 2 smoothly.<br>
At that time, the rotary furnace 31 of the rotary kiln 6 is configured to comprise a lot of gaps and, therefore, when the pressure Pa inside the rotary kiln 6 gets higher than the atmospheric pressure, fine pieces of the above described asbestos waste are scattered in the air from the rotary kiln 6 and may cause environmental pollution. Therefore, the fan 37 aspirates the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 so as to make the pressure ?2 inside the rotary kiln 6 always maintained at negative pressure against the air and thereby can certainly prevent the above described asbestos waste f rombeing scattered in the air.<br>
Here, in the case where the quantity of the mixture B taken in to the rotary kiln 6 is abundant, the temperature of the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 gets low and the above described flammable gas may be hampered from burning inside the burner furnace 2 at the time when such exhaust is introduced to the burner furnace 2. There, the rotary kiln 6 is designed so that the number of rotation of the motor 32b is made to decrease and the mixture B supplied to the rotary furnace 31 by the screw conveyer 32c decreases in quantity when the exit temperature Tg detected by the temperature sensor 32a gets lower than a predetermined temperature. Thus, when the exit temperature T2 detected by the temperature sensor 32a to reach not lower than a predetermined temperature after the sludge-like waste supplied to the rotary furnace 31 has decreased in quantity, the number of rotation of the motor 32b returns to the normal value.<br>
The temperature of the exhaust gas of the above described flammable gas and the exhaust of the rotary kiln 6 are high and, therefore, are introduced to a cooling tower 39 with a large capacity midway in the duct 38 before being discharged from the chimney 43 as described above, and thereby are cooled. In addition, in the case where the above described exhaust gas includes malodorous components and the like, the chemisorption apparatus 40 provided midway in the duct 38 converts the malodorous component and the like to stable matter which is removed from the exhaust gas and therefore environmental pollution due to the malodorous components and<br>
the like can be prevented. Moreover, fine particles included in the above described exhaust gas are trapped by a bug filter 41 provided midway in the duct 38 and the particles can be protected from being scattered in the air.<br>
In addition, as the dry-distilling gasification burning treatment apparatus shown in FIG. 1 nearly finishes dry distillation of the waste A in one of the gasification furnaces 1, it then takes in new waste A to the other gasification furnace 1 as described above, and ignites it and starts the burning treatment. And, if the generation of the flammable gas stops in the first gasification furnace 1, the switching valve 19a is immediately switched so that the gas passage 19 is connected to the other gasification furnace 1 and the flammable gas in the burner furnace 2 will burn uninterruptedly. Thus, the two gasification furnaces 1 and 1 are alternately switched to carry out the burning treatment of the above described waste and thereby the above described rotary kiln 6 can be operated continuously without any break.<br>
Here, the above described two gasification furnaces 1 and 1 can be switched smoothly by chronologically chasing, immediately after ignition, the temperature inside the gasification furnace 1 where the treatment is going on to burn the waste A. In addition, the burnt ashes of the waste A are left until the furnace temperature inside the gasification furnace 1 decreases sufficiently, and then extracted from an ash extracting port (not shown in the drawing) provided in the lower portion of the gasification furnace 1 and can be<br>
used in the melting treatment of the above described asbestos waste.<br><br>
What is claimed is: 1.  A method for melting asbestos waste, comprising:<br>
a process of supplying scalable mixing means with asbestos waste in a packaged state and a burnt ash of waste;<br>
a process of tearing to open the package of the asbestos waste inside the sealed mixing means to expose the asbestos to mix the asbestos waste and the burnt ash;<br>
a process of housing the mixed asbestos waste and burnt ash in a rotary kiln; and<br>
a process of burning a part of waste inside a gasification furnace while causing the remnants of the waste to undergo dry distillation to generate flammable gas, introducing the flammable gas to a burner furnace to burn and introduce at least a part of exhaust gas of the burner furnace to the rotary kiln, and heating the mixture of the asbestos waste and the burnt ash to melt the asbestos waste.<br>
2 .   The method for melting asbestos waste according to claim 1, wherein said asbestos waste is doubly packaged with water-resistant material.<br>
3. The method for melting asbestos waste according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said mixing means tears and opens said package of asbestos waste to expose the asbestos by sandwiching said asbestos waste in a packaged state with two screw conveyers provided mutually in parallel and turning the screw conveyers in the mutually opposite directions.<br><br>
4 . The method for melting asbestos waste according to any one of claim 1 to claim 3, wherein said waste is at least one kind of waste selected from the group consisting of refuse paper, refuse wood and refuse plastic.<br></td>
