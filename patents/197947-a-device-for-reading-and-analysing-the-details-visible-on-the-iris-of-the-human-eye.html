				<td>This invention relates to a device for reading and analysing the details visible on the iris of the human eye.<br>
The system proposed herein can be used to provide guidelines for discovering the individual pattern of health and well being through studying and analysing the iris map of the human eye which furnishes details visible on the iris (an illustration of which is referred to hereinafter). The intricate personal m ap of the iriss its shape, colour, patterns and pupils cycle can provide analysis of biochemistry as well as interpret emotional and circumstantial factors easy to diagnose diseases. Iris marks (edges, lesions, patches, circles etc) representing illnesses past and present are visible on the iris and measures can be taken to treat the present ones and prevent recurrence.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof<br><br>
The device, according to this invention, for reading and analyzing the details visible on the iris of the human eye, comprises .:--!•: -■■{ an iris image reader; a charge couple device array for converting the details from the said reader (in multicolour mtenstty variations) into electric sigaals; a scanner and RGB signal converter for scanning the said electric signals and converting the same into RGB signals; A/D converters and a multiplexer for converting the RGB signals to digital format; and for multiplexing the digital format signals for storage and display on a computer screen, display card or monitor; an image processor comprising a variety of algorithms, for processing the acquired image, said image processor incorporating a filter and image restorer; a pattern matcher for matching the relevant features extracted through the image processor with data base stored in the memory for disease identification; and an inference engine.<br>
This invention will now be described in greater detail by reference   to       the       accompanying    drawings,    which<br><br>
illustrate,  inter alia, by way of example, one of  the possible embodiments of the device proposed herein.<br>
Figs.  1 and 2 illustrating the iris maps of  the  left and right human eye<br>
Fig.3 illustrating the segments, divisions and fields,<br>
Fig.4 illustrating the layout of the embodiment<br>
Fig.5  illustrating  the iris image  reader  and  video digitiser layout<br>
and<br>
Fig.6  illustrating  the  image   processor  and  other components of the said embodiment.<br>
A  typical  iris  map is depicted in Figs. 1  and  2 These  diagrams are  conceptual diagrams but  relate  to near-reality.  For data manipulation and analysis by a<br><br>
personal computer and obtain diagnostic results, the iris is divided into S number of segments 
A typical irie map obtained as above wil1 be stored in the memory o-f the computer and compared with a number of reference standard frames already stored in the data base for diagnostic hypotheses and inference.<br>
It is learnt from documents and our own investigative studies that the iris records changes on its surface throughout its life cycle the health and well-being, biochemical changes and emotional changes as edges, lesions, patches, circles and intensity variations related   to  colour.  This  recorded  information   is<br><br>
partially permanent and partially variable according to disease and health conditions.<br>
Certain amount of iris details are anticipatory to the ■forthcoming diseases and health conditions. That is, the impending diseases and health conditions cast their symptoms on the iris as noticeable and detectable changes. These inferences are the basics for the iridology package for medical diagnosis.<br>
As indicated in our SDF formulation SDF for left iris map pinpoints a particular location in the iris map referring to the dedicated segments for sub-systems and organs. For example, SDF number 621 refers (Fig.1) to the area for kidney and 624 refers to the area for adrenal&gt;. The colour lesions, patches, circles can give guidelines that kidney and adrenal parts are to be thoroughly examined for exact diagnosis and treatment. Similarly, the right iris markings (iris map Fig.2) should be used for which the SDF number will be different.  This is made clear in the iris map for  the<br><br>
right  eye.<br>
The total system concept and -functionality o-f the device proposed herein is shown in Fig-4■ Tne information relating to speci-fie iris map (patients under diagnosis) is read by the iris image reader. The CCD (charge couple device) array converts the details (in multicolour intensity variations) on the iris into an electrical signal. The electrical signals corresponding to RGB (red, green and blue) ■faithfully represent the iris map details which can be reproduced with high degree of accuracy. These RGB signals are further processed using a video digitiser-and converted into a digital bit stream (digital data) for further image analysis and display. This is represented in Figs.4 and 5 . The appropriate user interface and display devices are included for easy usability of the system.<br>
Optical signals from the iris are acquired through  CCD array   and   converted  into  digital   format   using<br><br>
independent A/D converters. These signals are multiplexed for storage and display purposes. This stored information is used by the image processing software, pattern matching system and inference engine.<br>
The image processing software is used to process the acquired image. The software comprises a variety of algorithms and the most appropriate one is selected for maximum findings, such as, details of diseases, bio¬medical conditions and so on. In general, the goal of this selected algorithm is to present the image in the most desirable form or with the maximum attainable signal to noise ratio. This pre-processing includes, filtering and image restoration techniques. This image is then fed to the feature extraction system to extract out dignostically important artifacts 
 <br>
The relevant -features extracted through the image processing software are used to match with the stored knowledge base for disease identification. The knowledge base is created with the help of the domain experts tiridologists). Initially, iris sample frames (images) of various people with various disease patterns and hea1th condi tions wi11 be stored and this data base can be updated as and when new information is obtained from the domain experts.<br>
The inference engine which also forms part of the device is a built-in general purpose inference mechanism with forward, backward and random branching and search facility with user intervention at stages as and when required ifor use during system development and system upgradation &gt;. Archiving of case sheets and loading archived case sheets for problem solving &amp;re some of the essential features of the inference engine. Explanations covering intermediate results, cases examined, justifications for conclusions and path of hypotheses  and inferences, on-line answers  to<br><br>
queries such as why and how are some of the capabilities of the inference engine. In general it is a complex intelligent computer algorithm capable o-f performing at the level o-f human experts in the iridology domain for medical diagnosis.<br>
The advantages of the device proposed herein are* it is a non-invasive aid for medical diagnosis; it is a computer based medical diagnostic system and hence system capabilities can be enhanced by changing the processing software, that is, the algorithms. Visual attributes such as spatial domain, intensity domain and manipulations can also be effectively used for easy -extraction of hypothesis and inference; the knowledge base which is the most important building block of the device can be extended to fairly large size as and when unique information is obtained from domain experts. Thus the system capabilities can be enhanced as a continuous process; explanations covering intermediate results;- cases examined, justifications for conclusions and paths of investigation add  immense<br><br>
value to patient's satisfaction; the device can be easily operated by non-medical staff and the results passed on to the patients quidinq them to proper medical help.<br>
The device proposed herein is eminently ■  ~  suited  -for medical  diagnostic applications as a health  evaluation and  advisory system.  The device can also be  used as a person identification system.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation f here being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiment tffthe device proposed herein are possible, without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
