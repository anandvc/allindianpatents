				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to esters of hexyldodecanol with short-chain fatty acids and their use in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
State of the Art<br>
In the field of cosmetic preparations for skin care and hair care, and also in the field of pharmaceutical preparations, a large number of requirements are imposed by the consumer: apart from the cleaning and care effects, which determine the intended use, value is placed on such differing parameters as highest possible dermatological compatibility, good refatting properties, elegant appearance, optimum sensory impression and storage stability.<br>
Preparations which are used for the cleaning and care of the human skin and hair generally comprise, besides a series of surface-active substances, in particular oil bodies and water. The oil bodies/emollients used are, for example, hydrocarbons, ester oils and also vegetable and animal oils/fats/waxes. In order to meet the high requirements of the market with regard to sensory properties and optimum dermatological compatibility, new oil bodies are being continually developed and tested.<br>
Esters of hexyldecanol with fatty acids are known, for example, from US 6,391,287 (L'Or€al), where hexyldecyl caprylate (= octanoate), hexydecyl laurate (= dodecanoate), hexydecyl palmitate (= hexadecanoate) and hexyldecyl stearate (= octadecanoate) are described as cosolubilizers for bicyclic aromatic compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the compound hexyldecyl 2-ethylhexanoate is sold by Kokyu Alcohol Co. Ltd under the trade name ICEH.<br>
US 5,656,664 describes esters of alpha-methyl-branched alcohols with acids and their use as "conditioning agents" for the skin. A disadvantage of these esters is their unsatisfactory sensory properties and also their low stability, in particular upon thermal stress.<br>
In the Journal of the American Society, vol. 107, No. 24 from 1985 on p. 7073 in Scheme II as Example 11, G. Kirchner et al. describe an ester of 2-hexadecanol and butanoic acid.<br>
There is still a need for new oil bodies which have a more flexible use spectrum (e.g. compatibility with further cosmetic ingredients) and also meet the high requirements placed on the  sensory properties.  Of particular interest are oil bodies which produce a feeling referred to as  "light"  on the skin.  The distributability and speadability on the skin are of great importance. The modern consumer requires that oil bodies and the preparations produced therefrom generate a soft skin feel and that the skin feels cared for. A further  requirement  of  modern  raw  materials  for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations is that they can be obtained on the basis of renewable, vegetable raw materials. Of particular interest are compounds  that  are  characterized  by  advantageous sensory properties, and also of particular interest are compounds  which  are  storage-stable,  in  particular storage-stable at elevated temperatures.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which are suitable for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations, in particular as oil bodies/emollients and produce a sensorially particularly "light" skin feel. Furthermore, these substances should be obtainable on the basis of renewable vegetable raw materials.<br>
Subject matter of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that esters of 2-hexyldecanol with short-chain fatty acids are suitable for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations, and can be used in these preparations especially as sensorially particularly advantageous oil bodies.<br>
The esters according to the invention are characterized by advantageous sensory properties and by increased stability compared with the compounds known in the prior art.<br>
The invention provides the use of one or more esters of 2-hexyldecanol with fatty acids of the general formula (I)<br>
Ri-COOH,<br>
where  Ri  is  a  linear  or branched,  saturated  or unsaturated alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in  and/or  for  the production of  cosmetic  and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
The esters according to the invention are suitable in particular as oil bodies in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
The invention further provides esters of 2-hexyldecanol with fatty acids of the general formula (I)<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
where Ri is a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, with the exception of (J?)-2-hexyldecylbutanoic acid.<br>
2-Hexyldecanol is used as alcohol component of the ester.  2-Hexyldecanol  (synonymously 2-hexyl-l-decanol or 2-hexyldecyl alcohol) is commercially available as e.g.  under  the  trade  name  Eutanol®G  16  (Cognis Deutschand GmbH &amp; Co KG)  or as Exxal® 16  (Exxon Chemical  Company).  2-Hexyldecanol  is  a  so-called Guerbet alcohol which is available by self-condensation of (primary) alcohols under the influence of sodium or copper  at   elevated  temperature  and  pressure. 2-Hexyldecanol has a chiral carbon atom and can thus be present as the R  and also as the S  enantiomer, as any desired mixture of the two enantiomers, and also as racemate. Esters of 2-hexyldecanol within the context of this invention include both the esters of the respective enantiomers, mixtures of these enantiomers, and also the corresponding racemates.  Commercially available 2-hexyldecanol is generally the racemate.<br>
Fatty acids of the general formula (I)<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
where Ri is a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, are used as fatty acid component.<br>
The following are suitable, for example, as Rx: methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, [= 1-methylethyl], propenyl,<br>
isobutyl	[= 2-methylpropyl],        sec-butyl<br>
[= 1-methylpropyl], tert-butyl [= 1,1-dimethylethyl], but-2-enyl, but-3-enyl, but-1-enyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 1-ethylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylpropyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, 1-pentenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3-pentenyl, 4-pentenyl, hexyl, 1-methylpentyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, 4-methylpentyl, 1-ethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 3-ethylbutyl, 1-hexenyl, 2-hexenyl, 3 -hexenyl, 4-hexeny1, 5-hexenyl.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a fatty acid of the general formula (I) is used in which Rx is a linear or branched, saturated alkyl radical having 1 to 6  carbon atoms,  particularly preferably a linear, saturated alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Particularly suitable esters within the context of the<br>
invention are<br>
2-hexyldecylacetic acid ester (Rx = CH3) ,<br>
2-hexyldecylpropanoic acid ester (R1 = C2H5) ,<br>
2-hexyldecylpentanoic acid ester (R1 = C4H9) ,<br>
2-hexyldecylhexanoic acid ester (R1 = C5Hn) ,<br>
2-hexyldecylheptanoic acid ester (R1 = CsHi3) .<br>

Esters to be used particularly advantageously within the context of the invention are 2-hexyldecylacetic acid ester (R1 = CH3), 2-hexyldecylpropanoic acid ester (R1 = C2HS) , 2-hexyldecylbutanoic acid ester (R1 = C3H7) , 2-hexyldecylpentanoic acid ester (R1 = C4H9), 2-hexyldecylhexanoic acid ester (Rx = C5Hn), 2-hexyldecylheptanoic acid ester (R1 = C6H3) .<br>
Preparation<br>
The esters according to the invention are prepared by esterification methods known to the person skilled in the art. Thus, for example, the fatty acid can be esterified together with the hexyldecanol in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Both the alcohol components and also the fatty acid component can be obtained from vegetable raw materials, such as, for example, palm kernel oil or coconut oil. Consequently, the esters according to the invention are obtainable entirely on the basis of renewable raw materials.<br>
Use in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations Surprisingly, it has been established that the esters according to the invention are particularly suitable for the production of cosmetic preparations, and they are suitable in particular as oil bodies/emollients and/or consistency regulators in cosmetic preparations. The esters according to the invention are furthermore suitable   for  the  production  of  pharmaceutical preparations, where the according to the invention are used as technical auxiliaries, such as e.g. oil bodies. The esters according to the invention can serve for the production of  cosmetic  preparations,  such as,  for example, hair shampoo, hair lotions, foam baths, shower baths,   creams,   gels, _  lotions,   alcoholic   and aqueous/alcoholic   solutions,   emulsions,   wax/fatty masses, stick preparations, powders or salves. These compositions can also comprise, as further auxiliaries and  additives,   mild   surfactants,   oil   bodies, emulsifiers, pearlescent waxes, consistency regulators, thickeners, superfatting agents, stabilizers, polymers, silicone   compounds,    fats,   waxes,    lecithins, phospholipids,  biogenic  active ingredients,  UV sun protection    factors,    antioxidants,    deodorants, antiperspirants,  antidandruff agents,  film formers, swelling  agents,  insect  repellants,  self-tanning agents,  tyrosine inhibitors  (depigmentation agents), hydrotropes, solubilizers, preservatives, perfume oils, dyes and the like. Preference is given to the use of the esters according to the invention as oil bodies.<br>
The esters according to the invention can be used in cosmetic formulations as so-called "light emollients" in order to establish special properties, such as e.g. spreading behavior or volatility. The esters according to the invention furthermore permit the production of viscosity-stable cosmetic formulations. Compared with the 1-methyl-branched esters of the prior art, the esters according to the invention are characterized by<br>
improved sensory properties and also by increased stability, in particular upon thermal stress.<br>
The esters according to the invention can be used either individually or in any desired mixtures with one another.<br>
Examples<br>
Preparation example:<br>
1 mol of hexanoic acid (116 g) 1.1 mol (297 g) of 2-hexyldecanol (Guerbitol®16) and 0.22g of Fascat® 2001 (tin oxalate) were combined and heated to 240°C on the water separator for 3 h. The product, was then distilled over a 30 cm column (153-168°C at 0.8 mbar). The product is produced as a colorless and odorless oil.<br>
