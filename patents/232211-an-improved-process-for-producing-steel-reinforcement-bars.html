				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for producing steel reinforcement bars (rebars).<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a process for producing thermo- mechanic ally treated (TMT) plain-carbon and alloy (Cu/Cu-Cr ) steel rebars of improved quality as required for specific areas of applications.<br>
The torsteel rebars produced in the conventional process of manufacture are found to be deficient in tensile strength under cold and hot (600°C) conditions, elongations at break, toughness, bend and corrosion resistance as required for applications in the construction of bridges, flyovers, multistoried buildings, basement of chemical plants, off-shore structures, and storage for chemicals and industrial by-products.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for producing plain carbon as well as alloy steel rebars having higher tensile strength under cold and hot (600°C) conditions, elongation, toughness, bend and corrosion resistance compared with the torsteel rebars produced in the conventional process. The invented process is distinguished from the conventional process for producing torsteel rebars mainly in respect of the optimisation of (a) chemical composition of the alloy steel, (b) flow rate and pressure of cooling water used for cooling of the rebars, hot rolled in Merchant mills, and (c) the equalisation temperature of the bars produced.<br><br>
The invention is described fully and Particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accomoanying drawings, in which -<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the water cooling pipe used for controlling the cooling rate of hot rolled rebars;<br>
Figure 2 shows microstructure of torsteel rebars;<br>
Figure 3 shows microstructure of TMT plain carbon rebars;<br>
Figure A shows microstructure of TMT Cu bearing rebars;<br>
Figure 5 shows microstructure of TMT Cu-Cr bearing rebars.<br>
In Fig. 2, (a) shows the microstructure at the core and (b) shows the same at the rim region of the rebars.<br>
In each of Figs. 3 to 5, the microstructures shown in (a), (c) and (e) are for the core region and those shown in (b), (d) and (f) are for rim region of the rebars of nominal yield strength 415, 500 and 550 MPa respectively.<br>
The invented process comprises the following steps in sequence :-<br>
i)   preparing molten steel in open hearth/ID furnace with addition of alloying elements mostly in ladle and of copoer in furnace to produce reinforcement bars (rebars) of chemical composition (by weight %) : C-0.16 to 0.20, Mn-0.80 to 1.10, S-0.03 (max), P-0.05 (max), Si-0.05 to 0.08, Fe-the balance for the plain-carbon grade rebars, with addition of Cu-0.20 to 0.30 for each of Cu bearing and Cu-Cr bearing grades of rebars, and further<br><br>
addition of Cr-0.40 to 0.80 and Ni-0.20 to 0.30 for the Cu-Cr bearing grade of rebars produced;<br>
ii)         casting  of semi-killed/killed  steel into ingots (bottom/too poured)  each of weight 8 ton and  size -  top 770 x 700 mm,  bottom 700 x 630 mm, height 2.4  m;   or into billets   (continuous  cast)   (each billet,  of size  100 mm x  100 mm x 9 m);<br>
iii)         soaking  of ingots   in  soaking pits  at  1250-1300°C for 4-6 hours;<br>
iv)         rolling  of  ingots  into billets;<br>
v)         reheating  of rolled/concast billets  at  1225-1250°C in furnace;<br>
vi)         hot rolling  of billets  in Merchant mill into rebars of  12 to 25  mm diameter by means  of  14  strand  groove rollers at  a finishing temperature  of   925 to  960°C;<br>
vii)         partial  cooling  of the  rebars carried  out  in at least  one water cooling  Pipe,   such as herein described,  at cooling rate varying from 135  to 310°C/Sec by varying the pressure of   pressurised  cooling, water from 0.25  to 6.00 MPa, more preferably from 1.5 to  6.0 MPa and  also the  flow rate of compressed   air as  required;<br>
viii)         further cooling  of the  rebars  in  a cooling bed  at  an equalisation temperature of  560 to 680°C and   at  a cooling rate of  200 to   300°C/hour with air blast  to   Prevent  formation of elongated  copper/Cr-carbide  precipitates,  which enhances embrittlement  of the  rebars;<br><br>
The nominal  and  optimum chemical compositions of the three grades  of TMT rebars produced  in the invented  process are presented in Table-I  from which it is noted   :-<br>
(a)	the nominal content   (by weight %)  of C,  Mn,  S,  P and<br>
Si  is the   same in each of the  three grades  of TMT rebars,<br>
namely,  plain-carbon, Cu bearing and Cu-Cr bearing i.e. C-0.16<br>
to 0.20,  Mn-0.80 to  1-10,   S-0.03   (max),   P-0.05   (max)  and<br>
Si-0.05 to 0.08;<br>
(b)	nominal content of Cu in Cu bearing and Cu-Cr bearing<br>
grades  of TMT rebars is 0.20 to 0.30;<br>
(c)	actual content of Cu in Cu bearing  and Cu-Cr bearing<br>
grades  of TMT rebars is  0.20 and  0.30 respectively;<br>
(d)nominal and  actual content  of Cr in Cu-Cr bearing grade of TMT rebars is  0.40 to 0.80 and   0.80 respectively;<br>
(e)	nominal and  actual content  of Ni  in Cu-Cr bearing<br>
grade  of TMT rebars is  0.20 to  0.30 and  0.30 respectively;   and<br>
(f)	optimum composition of Cu-Cr bearing grade of TMT<br>
rebars is   :  C -  0.14 to 0.18,  Mn-O.yO to 0.80,  S-0.02 to 0.025,<br>
P-0.02 to 0.03,  Si-0.02 to  0.03,   Cu-0.30  (max),  Cr-0.50 to<br>
0.60,   and Ni-0.08 to  0.10,   the balance being  Fe.<br>
Referring to Fig.   1,  the cooling  oioe comprises an inner pipe   (4)  through which the  hot rolled   rebars  are passed from the entrance  end   (11)  to  the delivery end   (12) for treating the  same thermo-mechanically.     The inner pipe  is disposed co-axially in outer oipe   (4a)  of  internal diameter 30/40/50 mm and length 7.0 m.     In the outer pipe  are  provided   inlet funnel   (1), prechamber   (2),  return pipe   (9)  for cooling water,   inlet   (8a)<br><br>
for pressurised water,   inlet   (8b)  for pressurised water, supports   (13,   14),  back water chamber   (6) with return  pipe   (9), drain  pipe   (5) for free water outlet,  deflection chamber   (7), inlet   (10)  for compressed  air.     The inner Pipe/ has got  1st and  2nd nozzle heads   (3a,  3b).<br>
The hot rolled  rebars  are treated  thermo-mechanically by controlling the  cooling rate  of TMT rebars  at  135 to 310°C/ sec by varying the flow rate  of cooling water through the cooling pipe   (4a)  and  also inlet water pressure at  0.25 to 6.0 MPa,  more  preferably at  1.5 to 6.0 MPa,  using  one or two cooling water pipes   (as  per finished  bar diameter).<br>
The  equalisation temperature for the  rebars which  are Partially cooled  in the  cooling  pipe(s)  is carried  out  at a temperature varying from 560 to 680°C in the  cooling bed,  more preferably from 570 to 650°C.<br>
Rebars  of  20 mm diameter for each of the three grades, namely  plain-carbon,  Cu bearing and  Cu-Cr bearing  are treated thermo-mechanically at varying  cooling rate,   using  one or two water cooling  pipes,   and  subjected  to equalisation treatment at varying temperature  of the cooling bed.    The  yield   strength  of thermo-mechanically treated   (TMT)  rebars is determined.    The results  obtained   are  presented  in Table-II  from which it  is noted   :-<br>
(a)	yield   strength increases  with increase in  the cooling<br>
rate  and  inlet   pressure  of  cooling  water,   and  with decrease  in<br>
the  equalisation  temperature;   and<br>
(b)	optimum conditions  for Producing TMT rebars  of the three<br>
grades  are  as given in Table III.<br><br>
The tensile strength,  elongation, drop in yield strength at 600°C compared with yield strength at room temperature,  impact strength, bending property and corrosion resistance of the three grades  of TMT rebars  produced in the invented  process have been studied and compared with those of torsteel rebars produced in the conventional  process.    The results  are  presented in Table IV from which it is noted   :-<br>
(a)	tensile strength,   elongation and impact value of<br>
TMT rebars are appreciably higher in comparison with those of<br>
torsteel rebars;<br>
(b)	corrosion rate,  particularly in salt fog,  of TMT<br>
rebars is appreciably lower in comparison with that of torsteel<br>
rebars;<br>
(c)	tensile strength of TMT rebars increases from plain-<br>
carbon to Cu bearing and from Cu bearing to Cu-Cr bearing TMT<br>
rebars;<br>
(d)	drop in yield  strength at 600°C from that at room<br>
temperature is lower in Cu and Cu-Cr bearing TMT rebars<br>
compared with  plain-carbon TMT rebars;<br>
(e)	corrosion rate of TMT rebars decreases  from plain-<br>
carbon to Cu bearing and from Cu bearing to Cu-Cr bearing TMT<br>
rebars.<br>
From a comparison of the micro-structure of the torsteel and TMT rebars as illustrated in Figs.   2 to 5,  it is noted   :-<br><br>
(a)	microstructure of torsteel rebars (Fig. 2) is<br>
Ferrite-Fearlite both at the core and rim regions thereof;<br>
(b)	microstructure of TMT plain-carbon (Fig. 3), Cu<br>
bearing (Fig. 4) and Cu-Cr bearing (Fig. 5) TMT rebars are<br>
generally each Ferrite-Pearlite at the core region and<br>
tempered Martensite at the rim region thereof, and more<br>
particularly, Martensite near the surface and Bainite, Ferrite,<br>
Acicular Ferrite and pearlite towards/at the centre of the<br>
rebars.<br><br>
