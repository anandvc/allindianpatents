				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The field of the invention relates to method of providing a three-party <br>
connection among a first, second and third call participant during a voice-over-Internet-<br>
Protocol telephone call.	<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	<br>
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony is a rapidly growing alternative to switched circuit telephony<br>
Typically, a user purchases a VoIP software package and installs it on his personal computer (PC). To initiate a voice exchange with another party, the user enters an IP address of the other party and, if the other party has a similar software package, an exchange of voice information occurs.<br>
Audio information is sampled by the VoIP package once every 10-30 ms. The samples are encoded into an IP packet containing an IP address of the other party. The packet is transferred over a connection to the Internet, and, ultimately, to a PC of the other party.<br>
Within the PC of the other party, the sample is recovered and converted back into an analog signal. The analog signal is applied to a set of earphones or speaker and the other party hears the voice of the user. Voice information of the other party is transferred back to the original user under a similar process.<br>
While VoIP telephony works relatively well, its functionality has been limited to point-to-point applications. Accordingly, a need exists for more flexible methods of using VoIP telephony.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY A method and apparatus are provided for providing a three-party connection among a first, second and third call participant during a voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) telephone call. The method includes the steps of providing a respective first and second port within a transceiving terminal for receiving VoIP voice information of the VoIP telephone call from the first and second call participants, mixing the VoIP information from the ports of. the first and second call participants and transferring the mixed VoIP information to the third call participant.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of providing a three-party connection among a first, second and third call participant during a voice-over-Intemet-Protocol (VoIP) telephone call, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a respective first and second port within a transceiving terminal for receiving VoIP voice information of the VoIP telephone call from the first and second call participants;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a VoIP conferencing system 10, shown generally under an illustrated embodiment of the invention and in a context of use. As shown, a PC 18 (offering a conferencing functionality) may be connected between callers 12, 14 (participants) connected through the Internet 16 and a number of other participants (e.g., agents 20, 22, interactive voice response (IVR) unit 24 or an audio recorder 26). Participants may also include callers 28, 30<br><br>
4<br><br>
connected to a VoIP conference call at least partially through switched circuit connections established through the public switched telephone network 34.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts structure within the PC 18 which may be used to process VoIP information between a caller 12, 14 and an agent 20, 22. For purposes of explanation, an Internet protocol stack (PS) 40 and enterprise PS 42 may be understood to delineate the boundaries of those VoIP processes which occur within the CPU 36 and those processes which occur outside the CPU 36. It should be understood that the PSs 40, 42 may-be part of a single PS.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a pair of network interface cards 44, 64 used to interface the CPU 3 6 with external devices. While NICs 44 and 64 are shown as separate devices, it should be understood that under certain conditions (e.g., the agent telephone 46 is a LAN phone) then NICs 44 and 64 may be substantially identical.<br>
As shown, the Internet PS 40 includes a number of predetermined logical ports 48, 50 that may be used to provide a two-way connection with the caller 12, 14 through the Internet 16. One logical port 48 is provided for caller input (information from the agent 20, 22 to the caller 12, 14). A second logical port 50 is provided for caller output (information from the caller 12, 14 to the agent 20, 22).<br>
The enterprise PS 42 within the PC 18 also provides a number of predetermined ports 56, 58, 60, 62 for interfacing agents 20, 22 with the VoIP processes occurring within the CPU 36. Other ports 68, 70 of the enterprise PS 42 may be used to interface an interactive voice response (IVR) unit 78 to a call. An output port 72 may be used to provide information to a recording device 80. A further set of ports 74, 76 may be used to interface conference calls from the PSTN 34.<br>
5<br><br>
In the case of the agents 20, 22, a first set of ports 56, 60 may allow the VoIP conferencing software 35 (hereinafter "the software" or "the VoIP software") to receive voice information from the agents 20, 22. A second set of ports 58, 62 may be used to transfer voice information from'the VoIP process to the agents 20, 22.<br>
To set up a call, an agent 20, 22 may enter an <br>
IP address of a called party 12, 14 through a keypad or <br>
keyboard 66. The software within the CPU 36 may accept the IP address and transmit a set-up request to the called party.The CPU 36 under control of the VoIP conference software may also begin setting up the VoIP structures of FIG. 2. To facilitate the flow of voice information, the CPU 36 may form a first connection 54 for outbound information (from the agent to the called party) and a second connection 52 for inbound information (voice information from the called party to the agent).<br>
Turning first to the agent side of the VoIP connection, information exchanged with the agent 20, 22 through the NIC 44 may be exchanged under a pulse code modulation (PCM) format. The CPU 36, may cause the PCM information transceived through the NIC 44 to be reformatted into a real time protocol (RTP) format for use by the enterprise PS 42. Any appropriate RTP format (e.g., G.711, G.723, G.729, etc.) may be used.<br>
Similarly, the CPU 36 may reformat the RTP information exchanged between the Internet PS 4 0 and the Internet 16. More specifically, the CPU 36 and NIC 64 may convert the RTP data of the protocol stack 40 into an appropriate communication protocol (e.g., H.323) used for communicating through the Internet 16.<br>
Based upon the address entered through the key pad 66, the CPU 36 may exchange the VoIP voice information between the agent's enterprise ports 56, 58 and the Internet<br>
6<br><br>
ports 48, 50. Based upon the transfers, the agent 20, 22 may-converse with a called party 12, 14 using VoIP telephony.<br>
Upon occasion, the first agent (Al) may choose<br>
to conference in a second agent (A2). To conference in the<br>
second agent A2, the CPU 36 forms a number of software mixers<br>
82, 84, 86 (FIG. 3) for processing voice information. The<br>
mixers 82, 84, 86 may operate under a simple algorithm (e.g., <br>
(A+B)/2) intended to mix the PCM data of two callers (i.e., A <br>
and B) .	<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, incoming RTD data (i.e., caller output) received at a port 50 from a caller 12, 14 is mixed in a first mixer 82 with incoming RTD data (i.e., agent output) from an incoming port 62 of the second agent A2. The output of the mixer 82 is provided as output RTD data to incoming port 56 of the first agent Al.<br>
Similarly, incoming RTD data received at port 50 from a caller 12, 14 is mixed in a second mixer 86 with incoming RTD data from incoming port 58 of the first agent Al. The output of the second mixer is provided as output RTD data to incoming port 60 of the second agent A2.<br>
Finally, incoming RTD data received at a port 58 from a first agent Al is mixed in a third mixer 84 with incoming RTD data from an output port 62 of the second agent A2 . The output of the third mixer 84 is provided as output RTD data to incoming port 48 of the caller 12, 14.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts another illustrated embodiment where conferencing may be extended to other resources. As shown in FIG. 4 mixing may be performed of voice information from any of a number of sources. For example, tones and announcements may be played from an IVR 78 that may be heard only by the agent.<br>
For example, the CPU 36 may receive a message requesting set-up of a VoIP telephony connection from a caller<br>
7<br><br>
12, 14. Based upon the source IP address of the message, the CPU 36 may be able to retrieve information about the call originator 12, 14 from memory 38. Based upon the identity of the call originator 12, 14, the CPU 36 may select one or more messages from the IVR 78 to be played for the benefit of the agent 20, 22. Upon selecting the messages, the CPU 36 may activate message playback through the IVR 78 at the same time that the packet- based voice-path is set up through mixers 90, 92 and 98. Since the message is mixed in mixer 92 in the inbound voice path to the agent, the caller does not hear the message.<br>
Alternatively, the agent 20, 22 may choose to record the call. Recording may be necessary in the case of threatening or harassing calls. To record the call, the agent 20, 22 may enter a RECORD instruction through a keypad 66. In response, the CPU 36 may activate a recorder 80. The CPU 36 may also activate mixer 96. The mixer 96 mixes agent outgoing voice information with caller incoming voice information. The combined voice information is sent to the recorder 8 0 and recorded.<br>
In another illustrated embodiment, the agent may add a conference input to the call. The conference input may be derived from a set of PSTN ports 74, 76 connected to the PSTN 34 through a NIC 81. The agent 20, 22 may select a conference target by entry of a telephone number of a conference target 28, 30 through the keypad 66. The CPU 36 may outdial the entered telephone number of the conference target 28, 30. When the target 28, 30 answers, the CPU 36 may activate conference mixers 90, 94, 98 to conference in the conference target.<br>
Incoming voice information from the conference target 28, 30 may be mixed with voice information from the caller 12, 14 in a first mixer 90 and transferred to the agent<br>
8<br><br>
through an incoming agent port 56. Similarly, incoming voice information from the conference target 28, 30 may be mixed with voice information from the agent 20, 22 in a second mixer 98 and transferred to the caller 12, 14 through an outgoing caller port 50. Voice information of both the agent 20, 22 and caller 12, 14 may be mixed in a third mixer 94 and transferred to an outgoing port 76 of the conference target 28, 20.<br>
