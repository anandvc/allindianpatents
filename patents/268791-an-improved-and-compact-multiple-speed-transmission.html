CROSS-REERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/953,085 filed on July 31, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0028] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the eight speed automatic transmission of the present invention have an<br>
arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the<br>
four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of the first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to ground, stationary element, or a transmission<br>
housing. A second component or element of a first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of a second planetary<br>
gear set. A third component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br><br>
permanently coupled to a third component or element of the second planetary<br>
gear set. A first component or element of the second planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to first component or element of a third planetary gear set.<br>
A second component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a second component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br><br>
[0030] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0031] The input member 12 is coupled to the third node 14C of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14. The output member 22 is coupled to the second node<br>
18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16.<br>
The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is permanently connected<br>
to a ground, stationary element, or transmission housing 50. The third node 14C<br>
of the first planetary gear set 14 is permanently connected to the second node<br>
16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 is permanently connected to the third node 18C of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 is<br>
permanently connected to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
20.<br>
[0032] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 16B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the first node 16A of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear<br>
10<br><br>
set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the third node 20C of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20 to output member 22 and to the second node 18B of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the first node<br>
20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the third node 20C of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. A brake 34 selectively connects the first node 20A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20 to the ground, stationary element, or transmission<br>
housing 50.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0034] For example, the planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14C, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a ring gear member 14A.<br>
The sun gear member 14C is connected for common rotation to input member<br>
12. The ring gear member 14A is connected for common rotation to a first shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 44. The planet gear carrier member 14B rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one shown) and is connected to<br>
transmission housing 50 through a second shaft or interconnecting member 46.<br>
The planet gears 14D are each configured to intermesh with the both sun gear<br>
member 14C and the ring gear member 14A.<br><br>
[0035] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0036] The planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16A, a<br>
ring gear member 16C and a planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet gears 16D. The sun gear member 16A is connected for common<br>
rotation with the first shaft or interconnecting member 44. The ring gear member<br>
16C is connected for common rotation with a third shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 48. The planet carrier member 16B is connected for common rotation<br>
with the input shaft or member 12and a fourth shaft or interconnecting member<br>
52. The planet gears 16D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear<br>
member 16A and ring gear member 16C.<br>
[0037] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18C, a<br>
ring gear member 18A and a planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet gears 18D. The sun gear member 18C is connected for common<br>
rotation with the third shaft or interconnecting member 48. The ring gear<br>
member 18A is connected for common rotation with a fifth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54. The planet carrier member 18B is connected for<br>
common rotation with the output shaft or member 22 and with a sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 56. The planet gears 18D are each configured to<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 18C and the ring gear member 18A.<br><br>
[0038] The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20C, a<br>
planet carrier member 20A that rotatably supports a first set of planet gears 20D<br>
and a second set of planet gears 20E, and a ring gear member 20B. The sun<br>
gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with a seventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 58. The planet carrier member 20A is connected for<br>
common rotation with an eighth shaft or interconnecting member 60 and a ninth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 62. The ring gear member 20B is connected for<br>
common rotation with the fifth shaft or interconnecting member 54. The first set<br>
of planet gears 20D are each configured to intermesh with both the ring gear<br>
member 20B and the second set of planet gears 20E. The second set of planet<br>
gears 20E are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 20C<br>
and the first set of planet gears 20D.<br>
[0039] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30 and<br>
32 and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing.<br>
For example, the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 52 to the seventh shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 58. The second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the first<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 44 to the seventh shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 58. The third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect the sixth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 56 to the seventh shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 58. The fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect the<br>
seventh shaft or interconnecting member 58 to the ninth shaft or interconnecting<br><br>
member 62. The brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect the eighth shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 60 to ground, stationary element, or transmission<br>
housing 50 in order to restrict planet carrier member 20A from rotating relative to<br>
the ground, stationary element, or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio with a<br>
double overdrive. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by<br>
engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32, and brake 34), as<br>
will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various<br>
combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or engaged to<br>
achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear<br>
states are also presented although it should be appreciated that these numerical<br>
values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges<br>
to accommodate various applications and operational criteria of the transmission<br>
10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments<br>
of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios<br>
are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear<br>
configuration selected.<br><br>
[0041] To establish reverse gear, the second clutch 28 and the third<br>
clutch 30 are engaged or activated. The second clutch 28 connects the first shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 44 to the seventh shaft or interconnecting member<br>
58. The third clutch 30 connects the sixth shaft or interconnecting member 56 to<br>
the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 58. Likewise, the eight forward<br>
ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0042] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
